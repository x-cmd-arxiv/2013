chosen to be fixed to its physical value ($m^{phy}_s$) and five values of light
quark masses ($m_l$) that are varied in the interval 1/20$\gtrsim m_l/m^{phy}_s

  of a result by D\'enes",,,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This article is devoted to the computation of Jack connection coefficients, a
generalization of the connection coefficients of two classical commutative
subalgebras of the group algebra of the symmetric group: the class algebra and
the double coset algebra. The connection coefficients of these two algebraic
structures are of significant interest in the study of Schur and zonal
polynomials as well as the irreducible characters of the symmetric group and
the zonal spherical functions. Furthermore they play an important role in
combinatorics as they give the number of factorizations of a permutation into a
product of permutations with given cyclic properties. Usually studied
separately, these two families of coefficients share strong similar properties.
First (partially) introduced by Goulden and Jackson in 1996, Jack connection
coefficients provide a natural unified approach closely related to the theory
of Jack polynomials, a family of bases in the ring of symmetric functions
indexed by a parameter \alpha that generalizes both Schur (case \alpha = 1) and
zonal polynomials (case \alpha = 2). Jack connection coefficients are also
directly linked to Jack characters, a general view of the characters of the
symmetric group and the zonal spherical functions. Goulden and Jackson
conjectured that these coefficients are polynomials in \alpha with nice
combinatorial properties, the so-called Matchings-Jack conjecture. In this
paper, we use the theory of Jack symmetric functions and the Laplace Beltrami
operator to show the polynomial properties of Jack connection coefficients in
some important cases. We also provide explicit formulations including notably a
generalization of a classical formula of D\'enes for the number of minimal
factorizations of a permutation into transpositions.

have been verified to an excellent degree, leaving many models compatible with
observations. In this thesis we studied third-order correlations, that might
allow one to further distinguish between inflationary models. From all the
possible extensions of the standard inflationary model, we chose to study
two-field models with canonical kinetic terms and flat field space. The new
feature is the presence of the so-called isocurvature perturbation. Its
interplay with the adiabatic perturbation outside the horizon gives birth to
non-linearities characteristic of multiple-field models. In this context, we
established the second-order gauge-invariant form of the adiabatic and
isocurvature perturbation and found the third-order action that describes their
interactions. Furthermore, we built on and elaborated the long-wavelength
formalism in order to acquire an expression for the parameter of
non-Gaussianity fNL as a function of the potential of the fields. We next used
this formula to study analytically, within the slow-roll hypothesis, general
classes of potentials and verified our results numerically for the exact
theory. From this study, we deduced general conclusions about the properties of
fNL, its magnitude depending on the characteristics of the field trajectory and
the isocurvature component, as well as its dependence on the magnitude and
relative size of the three momenta of which the three-point correlator is a
function.

combinatorial problems. However, ASP cannot easily be used for reasoning about
uncertain information. Possibilistic ASP (PASP) is an extension of ASP that
combines possibilistic logic and ASP. In PASP a weight is associated with each
rule, where this weight is interpreted as the certainty with which the
conclusion can be established when the body is known to hold. As such, it
allows us to model and reason about uncertain information in an intuitive way.
In this paper we present new semantics for PASP, in which rules are interpreted
as constraints on possibility distributions. Special models of these
constraints are then identified as possibilistic answer sets. In addition,
since ASP is a special case of PASP in which all the rules are entirely
certain, we obtain a new characterization of ASP in terms of constraints on
possibility distributions. This allows us to uncover a new form of disjunction,
called weak disjunction, that has not been previously considered in the
literature. In addition to introducing and motivating the semantics of weak
disjunction, we also pinpoint its computational complexity. In particular,
while the complexity of most reasoning tasks coincides with standard
disjunctive ASP, we find that brave reasoning for programs with weak
disjunctions is easier.

$\OPT_\swm/O(\log c_{\max})$, where $\OPT_\swm$ is the optimum social welfare
and $c_{\max}$ is the maximum item-supply; thus, this yields an $O(\log

statistical tools to recover a low-rank structure of the data. In the
high-dimensional settings, the leading eigenvector of the sample covariance can
be nearly orthogonal to the true eigenvector. A sparse structure is then
commonly assumed along with a low rank structure. Recently, minimax estimation
rates of sparse PCA were established under various interesting settings. On the
other side, Bayesian methods are becoming more and more popular in
high-dimensional estimation, but there is little work to connect frequentist
properties and Bayesian methodologies for high-dimensional data analysis. In
this paper, we propose a prior for the sparse PCA problem and analyze its
theoretical properties. The prior adapts to both sparsity and rank. The
posterior distribution is shown to contract to the truth at optimal minimax
rates. In addition, a computationally efficient strategy for the rank-one case
is discussed.

motor can be controlled to drive many processes such as the arm of a robot. The
most famous and well known controller for such applications is PID controller.
It uses proportional, integral and derivative functions to control the input
signal before sending it to the plant unit. In this paper, another controller
based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) control is examined to replace the PID
controller for controlling the angular position of a DC motor to drive a robot

valence-quark masses and lattice spacings may be determined from an
ensemble-by-ensemble analysis, and the results for the quark mass ratios then
extrapolated to the continuum limit. Our central values of the charmed meson
decay constants, however, come from an alternative analysis, which uses
staggered chiral perturbation theory for the heavy-light mesons, and allows us
to incorporate data at unphysical quark masses where statistical errors are
often smaller. A jackknife analysis propagated through all of these steps takes
account of the correlations among all the quantities used in the analysis.
Systematic errors from the finite spatial size and EM effects are estimated by
varying the parameters in the analysis, and systematic errors from the

complex band structure involving multiple Dirac cones. These materials are
potentially highly tunable by external electric field, temperature or strain

and nano-mechanical systems. Theoretically, it has been predicted that
different Dirac cones, offset in energy and momentum-space, might harbor vastly
different orbital character, a unique property which if experimentally
realized, would present an ideal platform for accomplishing new spintronic
devices. However, the orbital texture of the Dirac cones, which is of immense
importance in determining a variety of materials properties, still remains
elusive in TCIs. Here, we unveil the orbital texture in a prototypical TCI
Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Se. By using Fourier-transform (FT) scanning tunneling
spectroscopy (STS) we measure the interference patterns produced by the
scattering of surface state electrons. We discover that the intensity and
energy dependences of FTs show distinct characteristics, which can directly be
attributed to orbital effects. Our experiments reveal the complex band topology
involving two Lifshitz transitions and establish the orbital nature of the
Dirac bands in this new class of topological materials, which could provide a
different pathway towards future quantum applications.

similar high levels of predictability, even when temporal correlations are

terms of predictability negative behavior has a wider variety than positive
actions. The actions which contain information to best predict an individual's
subsequent action are negative, such as attacks or enemy markings, while
positive actions of friendship marking, trade and communication contain the
least amount of predictive information. These observations show that predicting

Survey (SDSS) data release 7 and Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey
(BOSS). We find that, for the both cases of using SN data alone and using
SN+CMB+GC data, involving an additional parameter of $\beta$ can reduce
$\chi^2$ by $\sim$ 36; this shows that $\beta$ deviates from a constant at
6$\sigma$ confidence levels. Adopting SN+CMB+GC data, we find that compared to
the constant $\beta$ case, varying $\beta$ yields a larger fractional matter
density $\Omega_{m0}$ and a smaller reduced Hubble constant $h$; moreover,
varying $\beta$ significantly increases the value of HDE model parameter $c$,
leading to $c\approx 0.8$, consistent with the constraint results obtained
before Planck. These results indicate that the evolution of $\beta$ should be
taken into account seriously in the cosmological fits. In addition, we find
that relative to the differences between the constant $\beta$ and varying
$\beta(z)$ cases, the effects of different light-curve fitters on parameter
estimation are very small.

stripes are characterized by a texture period L and a fraction of the gas area
$\phi$. For very large values of h/R we recover the macroscopic formulae for a
sphere moving towards a hydrophilic no-slip plane. For h/R=O(1) and smaller the

uniform perfectly slipping wall. At a thinner gap, $h\ll R$ the force reduction
compared to a classical result becomes more pronounced, and is maximized by
increasing $\phi$. In the limit of very small separations our simulation data
are in quantitative agreement with an asymptotic equation, which relates a
correction to a force for superhydrophobic slip to texture parameters. In
addition, we examine the flow and pressure field and observe their oscillatory
character in the transverse direction in the vicinity of the wall, which
reflects the influence of the heterogeneity and anisotropy of the striped
texture. Finally, we investigate the lateral force on the sphere, which is
detectable in case of very small separations and is maximized by stripes with

data-driven time-frequency analysis \cite{HS11,HS13-1} and the classical second
order differential equations. The main idea of the data-driven time-frequency
analysis is to decompose a multiscale signal into a sparsest collection of
Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) over the largest possible dictionary via
nonlinear optimization. These IMFs are of the form $a(t) \cos(\theta(t))$ where
the amplitude $a(t)$ is positive and slowly varying. The non-decreasing phase
function $\theta(t)$ is determined by the data and in general depends on the
signal in a nonlinear fashion. One of the main results of this paper is that we
show that each IMF can be associated with a solution of a second order ordinary
differential equation of the form $\ddot{x}+p(x,t)\dot{x}+q(x,t)=0$. Further,
we propose a localized variational formulation for this problem and develop an
effective $l^1$-based optimization method to recover $p(x,t)$ and $q(x,t)$ by
looking for a sparse representation of $p$ and $q$ in terms of the polynomial
basis. Depending on the form of nonlinearity in $p(x,t)$ and $q(x,t)$, we can
define the degree of nonlinearity for the associated IMF. %and the
corresponding coefficients for the associated highest order nonlinear terms.
This generalizes a concept recently introduced by Prof. N. E. Huang et al.

robustness and stability of the proposed method for data with or without noise.

addition, the doping density (and conductivity) of the host can be easily
controlled by adjusting the thickness of the bottom F4TCNQ layer. This
alternative scheme for doping is simpler than the conventional way of doping
small molecules which involves simultaneous co-evaporation of host and dopant.
In the sequential doping scheme outlined here, bulk doping of the host takes
place due to rapid diffusion of F4TCNQ in the host material. The motion of
F4TCNQ in the host is complex and is not always described by a simple diffusion
process. In situ transport measurements provide a quick and easy way of
measuring dopant diffusion in new hosts. Based on the doping results, we also
outline a possible route to improved transconductance for organic thin film

background (CMB) shift parameter and the secular Sandage-Loeb (SL) test. We
find that the inclusion of SL test can obviously provide more stringent
constraint on the parameters in both models. For the constant coupling model,
the interaction term including the SL test is estimated at $\delta=-0.01 \pm
0.01 (1\sigma) \pm 0.02 (2\sigma)$, which has been improved to be only a half
of original scale on corresponding errors. Comparing with the combination of
SNIa and OHD, we find that the inclusion of SL test directly reduces the
best-fit of interaction from 0.39 to 0.10, which indicates that the
higher-redshift observation including the SL test is necessary to track the
evolution of interaction. For the varying coupling model, we reconstruct the
interaction $\delta (z)$, and find that the interaction is also negative
similar as the constant coupling model. However, for high redshift, the
interaction generally vanishes at infinity. The constraint result also shows
that the $\Lambda$CDM model still behaves a good fit to the observational data,
and the coincidence problem is still quite severe. However, the phantom-like
dark energy with $w_X<-1$ is slightly favored over the $\Lambda$CDM model.

approximate density matrices which are globally consistent with the local

optimal density matrix representation by slowly decreasing the temperature in
an annealing algorithm, or by minimizing an approximate Bethe free energy
depending on the reduced density matrices and some cavity messages originated
from the Bethe approximation of the entropy. We obtain the classical Bethe
expression for the entropy within a naive (mean-field) approximation of the
cavity messages, which is expected to work well at high temperatures. In the
next order of the approximation, we obtain another expression for the Bethe
entropy depending only on the diagonal elements of the reduced density
matrices. In principle, we can improve the entropy approximation by considering
more accurate cavity messages in the Bethe approximation of the entropy. We
compare the annealing algorithm and the naive approximation of the Bethe
entropy with exact and approximate numerical simulations for small and large
samples of the random transverse Ising model on random regular graphs.

surface, on the vein evolution in 3-D using a thermodynamically consistent
approach, while explaining the benefits of accounting for an extra
dimensionality. The 3-D simulation results are supplemented by innovative
numerical post-processing and advanced visualization techniques. The new
methodologies to measure the tracking efficiency demonstrate the importance of
accounting the temporal evolution; no such information is usually accessible in
field studies and notoriously difficult to obtain from laboratory experiments
as well. The grain growth statistics obtained by numerically post-processing
the 3-D computational microstructures explain the pinning mechanism which leads
to arrest of grain boundaries/multi-junctions by crack peaks, thereby,
enhancing the tracking behavior.

counting law of the number of NG bosons of the normal NG theorem in
nonrelativistic and Lorentz-symmetry-violated relativistic theories is studied
in detail, with emphasis on its mathematical aspect from Lie algebras, geometry
to number theory. The basis of counting law of NG bosons in the anomalous NG
theorem is examined by Lie algebras (local) and Lie groups (global). A
quasi-Heisenberg algebra is found generically in various symmetry breaking
schema of the anomalous NG theorem, and it indicates that it causes a
violation/modification of the Heisenberg uncertainty relation in an NG sector
which can be experimentally confirmed. The formalism of effective potential is
presented for understanding the mechanism of anomalous NG theorem with the aid
of our result of Lie algebras. After an investigation on a bosonic kaon
condensation model with a finite chemical potential as an explicit
Lorentz-symmetry-breaking parameter, a model Lagrangian approach on the
anomalous NG theorem is given for our general discussion. Not only the
condition of the counting law of true NG bosons, but also the mechanism to
generate a mass of massive NG boson is also found by our examination on the
kaon condensation model. Furthermore, the generation of a massive mode in the
NG sector is understood by the quantum uncertainty relation of the Heisenberg
algebra, obtained from a symmetry breaking of a Lie algebra, which realizes in
the effective potential of the kaon condensation model. Hence the relation
between a symmetry breaking scheme, a Heisenberg algebra, a mode-mode coupling,
and the mechanism of mass generation in an NG sector is established. Finally,
some relations between the Riemann hypothesis and the anomalous NG theorem are
presented.

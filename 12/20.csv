into a jet containing a heavy quark, carrying a fraction of the jet momentum.
They are two-scale objects, sensitive to the heavy quark mass, $m_Q$, and to a
jet resolution variable, $\tau_N$. We discuss how cross sections for heavy
flavor production at high transverse momentum can be expressed in terms of
heavy quark fragmenting jet functions, and how the properties of these
functions can be used to achieve a simultaneous resummation of logarithms of
the jet resolution variable, and logarithms of the quark mass. We calculate the
heavy quark fragmenting jet function $\mathcal G_Q^Q$ at $\mathcal
O(\alpha_s)$, and the gluon and light quark fragmenting jet functions into a
heavy quark, $\mathcal G_g^Q$ and $\mathcal G_l^Q$, at $\mathcal
O(\alpha_s^2)$. We verify that, in the limit in which the jet invariant mass is
much larger than $m_Q$, the logarithmic dependence of the fragmenting jet
functions on the quark mass is reproduced by the heavy quark fragmentation
functions. The fragmenting jet functions can thus be written as convolutions of
the fragmentation functions with the matching coefficients $\mathcal J_{i j}$,
which depend only on dynamics at the jet scale. We reproduce the known matching
coefficients $\mathcal J_{i j}$ at $\mathcal O(\alpha_s)$, and we obtain the
expressions of the coefficients $\mathcal J_{g Q}$ and $\mathcal J_{l Q}$ at
$\mathcal O(\alpha_s^2)$. Our calculation provides all the perturbative
ingredients for the simultaneous resummation of logarithms of $m_Q$ and
$\tau_N$.

addition to the observational challenges for these studies, conclusions are
complicated by the influence of selection effects. We demonstrate that there is
presently no statistical significant evidence for cosmological evolution in the
black hole-bulge relations, once these selection effects are taken into account
and corrected for. We present a fitting method, based on the bivariate
distribution of black hole mass and galaxy property, that accounts for the

intrinsic black hole - bulge relation unbiased. While prior knowledge is
restricted to a minimum, we at least require knowledge of either the sample
selection function and the mass dependence of the active fraction, or the
spheroid distribution function and the intrinsic scatter in the black hole -
bulge relation. We employed our fitting routine to existing studies of the
black hole-bulge relation at z~1.5 and z~6, using our current best knowledge of
the distribution functions. There is no statistical significant evidence for
positive evolution in the MBH-M* ratio out to z~2. At z~6 the current
constraints are less strong, but we demonstrate that the large observed
apparent offset from the local black hole-bulge relation at z~6 is fully
consistent with no intrinsic offset. The method outlined here provides a tool

K-alpha fluorescence spectrum, a poor choice of chi^2 can lead to biases of at
least 10% in the estimated resolution when up to thousands of photons are
observed. The best remedy is a Poisson maximum-likelihood fit, through a simple
modification of the standard Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for chi^2
minimization. Where the modification is not possible, another approach allows
iterative approximation of the maximum-likelihood fit.

illuminating example we consider chiral perturbation theory gauged under the
electromagnetic $U(1)$ symmetry. This theory describes the low-energy
interactions of the octet of pseudo-Goldstone bosons in QCD with photons and
has been discussed extensively in the literature. Peculiarities of the standard
approach are pointed out and it is shown how these are resolved within our
scheme. The presentation follows closely our recent discussion of power
counting for the electroweak chiral Lagrangian. The systematics of the latter
is reviewed and shown to be consistent with the concept of chiral dimensions.
The results imply that naive dimensional analysis (NDA) is incomplete in
general effective field theories, while still reproducing the correct counting
in special cases.

in understanding of tunneling processes between normal metals and metals
containing electrons which occupy partially filled f-orbitals. In heavy-fermion
materials the effective mass of the quasiparticles far exceeds the bare
electron mass due to strong hybridization between conduction and f-orbital
states. Kondo lattices form a class of heavy-fermion systems in which an
average occupation number of f-electron states is close to an integer.
Therefore, the tunneling into a Kondo lattice necessarily involves co-tunneling
process of a tip electron into an f-electron state of a Kondo lattice. This
co-tunneling process is manifested in the Fano-lineshape of differential
conductance as a function of an applied voltage, which has been routinely
observed in recent experiments on various Kondo lattice systems. To illustrate
these ideas, I discuss the problem of the tunneling junction when the single
particle states in the tip are also a product of hybridization between
conduction and f-states, i.e. tunneling between two heavy-fermion materials.

cosmic ray protons if supramassive neutron stars were formed in a good fraction

First, in estimating the parameters of some model for the data, the resulting
posterior distribution may be multi-modal or exhibit pronounced (curving)
degeneracies. Secondly, in selecting between a set of competing models,
calculation of the Bayesian evidence for each model is computationally
expensive using existing methods such as thermodynamic integration. Nested
Sampling is a Monte Carlo method targeted at the efficient calculation of the
evidence, but also produces posterior inferences as a by-product and therefore
provides means to carry out parameter estimation as well as model selection.
The main challenge in implementing Nested Sampling is to sample from a
constrained probability distribution. One possible solution to this problem is
provided by the Galilean Monte Carlo (GMC) algorithm. We show results of
applying Nested Sampling with GMC to some problems which have proven very
difficult for standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and down-hill methods,
due to the presence of large number of local minima and/or pronounced (curving)
degeneracies between the parameters. We also discuss the use of Nested Sampling
with GMC in Bayesian object detection problems, which are inherently
multi-modal and require the evaluation of Bayesian evidence for distinguishing

SN 1572. We redetermine the Ni abundance of this star and compare it with new
abundance data from stars of the Galactic disk, finding that [Ni/Fe] is about
1.7 sigma above the Galactic trend. From the high velocity (v_b = -50+/-14
km/s) of Tycho-G perpendicular to the Galactic plane, its metallicity, and its
Ni excess, we find the probability of its being a chance interloper to be P <
0.00037 at most. The projected rotational velocity of the star should be below
current observational limits. The projected position of Tycho-G is, within the
uncertainties, consistent with the centroid of the X-ray emission of Tycho's
SNR; moreover, its brightness is generally consistent with the post-explosion
evolution of the luminosity of a SN companion. Among the other 23 stars having
V<22 mag and located within 42 arcsec from the X-ray centroid, only 4 are at
distances compatible with that of the SNR, and none of them shows any

we assume on $L_t$ is that $L_t$ is dense and lies in a low dimensional

where this problem occurs is in video surveillance where the goal is to
separate a slowly changing background ($L_t$) from moving foreground objects

novel solution called Recursive Projected CS (ReProCS). In this work we develop
a simple modification of the original ReProCS idea and analyze it. This
modification assumes knowledge of a subspace change model on the $L_t$'s. Under

bounded by a time-invariant and small value. In simulation experiments, we
observe that the last assumption holds as long as there is some support change

rate depends on the state of both departure and arrival sites. We recover the
misanthrope and the target process as special cases for which the probability
of the steady state factorizes over sites. We discuss conditions which lead to
the condensation of particles and show that although two different hop rates
can lead to the same steady state, they do so with sharply contrasting
dynamics. The first case resembles the dynamics of the zero-range process,
whereas the second case, in which the hop rate increases with the occupation
number of both sites, is similar to instantaneous gelation models. This new
""explosive"" condensation reveals surprisingly rich behaviour, in which the
process of condensate's formation goes through a series of collisions between
clusters of particles moving through the system at increasing speed. We perform
a detailed numerical and analytical study of the dynamics of condensation: we
find the speed of the moving clusters, their scattering amplitude, and their
growth time. We finally show that the time to reach steady state decreases with
the size of the system.

~ 7 within the UltraVISTA DR2 and UKIDSS UDS DR10 data, which together provide
1.65 sq deg of near-infrared imaging with overlapping optical and Spitzer data.
Using a full photo-z analysis to identify high-z galaxies and reject
contaminants, we have selected a sample of 34 luminous (-22.7 < M_UV < -21.2)
galaxies with 6.5 < z < 7.5. Crucially, the deeper imaging provided by
UltraVISTA DR2 confirms all of the robust objects previously uncovered by
Bowler et al. (2012), validating our selection technique. Our sample includes
the most massive galaxies known at z ~ 7, with M_* ~ 10^{10} M_sun, and the
majority are resolved, consistent with larger sizes (r_{1/2} ~ 1 - 1.5 kpc)
than displayed by less massive galaxies. From our final sample, we determine
the form of the bright end of the rest-frame UV galaxy luminosity function (LF)
at z ~ 7, providing strong evidence that the bright end of the z = 7 LF does
not decline as steeply as predicted by the Schechter function fitted to fainter
data. We consider carefully, and exclude the possibility that this is due to
either gravitational lensing, or significant contamination of our galaxy sample
by AGN. Rather, our results favour a double power-law form for the galaxy LF at
high z, or, more interestingly, a LF which simply follows the form of the
dark-matter halo mass function at bright magnitudes. This suggests that the
physical mechanism which inhibits star-formation activity in massive galaxies
(i.e. AGN feedback or some other form of `mass quenching') has yet to impact on
the observable galaxy LF at z ~ 7, a conclusion supported by the estimated
masses of our brightest galaxies which have only just reached a mass comparable
to the critical `quenching mass' of M_* = 10 ^{10.2} M_sun derived from studies
of the mass function of star-forming galaxies at lower z.

intermolecular cross-links that, at sufficiently high protein concentration,
can transform a protein solution into a gel. Although GA has been used as a
cross-linking reagent for decades, neither the cross-linking chemistry nor the
microstructure of the resulting protein gel have been clearly established. Here
we use small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to characterise the microstructure
and structural kinetics of gels formed by cross-linking of pancreatic trypsin
inhibitor, myoglobin or intestinal fatty acid-binding protein. By comparing the
scattering from gels and dilute solutions, we extract the structure factor and
the pair correlation function of the gels. The protein gels are spatially
heterogeneous, with dense clusters linked by sparse networks. Within the
clusters, adjacent protein molecules are almost in contact, but the protein
concentration in the cluster is much lower than in a crystal. At the $\sim$1 nm
SAXS resolution, the native protein structure is unaffected by cross-linking.
The cluster radius is in the range 10 - 50 nm, with the cluster size determined
mainly by the availability of lysine amino groups on the protein surface. The
development of structure in the gel, on time scales from minutes to hours,
appears to obey first-order kinetics. Cross-linking is slower at acidic pH,
where the population of amino groups in the reactive deprotonated form is low.
These results support the use of cross-linked protein gels in NMR studies of
protein dynamics and for modeling NMR relaxation in biological tissue.

However, that often comes at the expense of increased risk of normal-tissue

goal of this study is to develop a mathematical framework to obtain drug and

incorporating these two mechanisms into the radiation fractionation problem.
Considering each mechanism individually, we first derive closed-form
expressions for the optimal radiation fractionation regimen and the
corresponding drug administration schedule. We next study the case in which
both mechanisms are simultaneously present and develop a dynamic programming
framework to determine optimal treatment regimens. Results show that those
chemotherapeutic agents that interact with radiation may change optimal
radiation fractionation regimens. Moreover, administration of chemotherapeutic
agents possessing both mechanisms may give rise to optimal non-stationary

find that this method achieves better classification results than denoising
autoencoders, networks trained with dropout, and RBMs. k-sparse autoencoders
are simple to train and the encoding stage is very fast, making them
well-suited to large problem sizes, where conventional sparse coding algorithms
cannot be applied.

particular, we focus on how electroweak symmetry breaking and the Higgs mass
are reproduced in models where the symmetry SO(5) is linearly realized. The
global symmetry forbids tree-level contributions to the Higgs potential coming
from D-terms, differently from what happens in most of the SUSY little-Higgs
constructions. While the stops are generally heavy, light fermion top partners
below 1 TeV are predicted. In contrast to what happens in non-SUSY composite
Higgs models, they are necessary to reproduce the correct top, rather than
Higgs, mass. En passant, we point out that, independently of SUSY, models where
tR is fully composite and embedded in the 5 of SO(5) generally predict a too
light Higgs.

refocusing in NMR systems. We show how an array of QCA cells can be used for
isolated single qubit, as well as multi-qubit operations, such as the CNOT, by
dividing the cells into active and passive sets such that the active cells
undergo the transform while passive cells hold their quantum states. The same
technique is used for developing a multi-qubit quantum memory. The effect of
imperfect control parameters is discussed and the total time for a typical

the base units will be linked to fundamental constants of nature [1]. As for
the electrical base unit ""Ampere"", it will be linked to the elementary charge
e, requiring a corresponding quantum standard [2, 3]. Many concepts for such a
standard have been investigated [4-14] relying on controlling the
time-dependent tunnelling of electrons. However, the stochastic nature of
quantum mechanical tunnelling intrinsically evokes uncontrolled deviations from
the nominally quantized current. Alternatively, the counting of electrons [15,
16] has been explored but is severely limited in current amplitude and
uncertainty by the low detector bandwidth. The late M. Wulf proposed [17] that
this fundamental problem of electrical quantum metrology could be overcome by
combining serial single-electron pumps with charge detectors allowing the
generation of a quantized current and the in-situ detection of its stochastic
deviations. Here, we experimentally demonstrate such quantized-current
generation with in-situ detection of tunnelling errors at low frequencies and a
reduction of the total current uncertainty by more than one order of magnitude.
After frequency scaling this should enable a validated primary standard for the
redefined SI base unit Ampere.

theory of interacting fields on a curved space-time, following a point of view
pioneered by Stueckelberg and Bogoliubov and developed by Epstein-Glaser on the
flat Minkowski space-time. In 2000, a breakthrough was done by Brunetti and
Fredenhagen who were able to extend the Epstein-Glaser theory by exploiting the
point of view developed by Radzikowski to define quantum states on a curved
space-time in terms of wave-front sets. These results were further extended by
Fredenhagen, Brunetti, Hollands, Wald, Rejzner, etc. to Yang-Mills fields and
the gravitation. However, even for theories without gauge invariance, many
mathematical details were left unexplored and unquestioned. Our task was
precisely to derive fully rigorously this theory in the case there is no gauge
invariance. We propose in our work a complete review of the result, solving
numerous questions, adding many new results around this program and,
eventually, giving more precise details on the counterterms and ambiguities in
the renormalization process, and a deeper understanding of the geometry of the
wave front set of the n-point functions.

dynamics on the complete graph, in which infected individuals may only spread
to neighboring susceptible individuals at fixed rate $\lambda>0$ while
recovered individuals may only spread to neighboring infected individuals at
fixed rate $1$. This is also a variant of the so-called chase-escape process
introduced by Kordzakhia and then Bordenave & Ganesan. Our work is the first
study of this dynamics on complete graphs. Starting with one infected and one
recovered individuals on the complete graph with $N+2$ vertices, and stopping
the process when one type of individuals disappears, we study the asymptotic
behavior of the probability that the infection spreads to the whole graph as
$N\rightarrow\infty$ and show that for $\lambda\in (0,1)$ (resp. for
$\lambda>1$), the infection dies out (resp. does not die out) with probability
tending to one as $N\rightarrow\infty$, and that the probability that the
infection dies out tends to $1/2$ for $\lambda=1$. We also establish limit
theorems concerning the asymptotic state of the system in all regimes and show
that two additional phase transitions occur in the subcritical phase
$\lambda\in (0,1)$: at $\lambda=1/2$ the behavior of the expected number of
remaining infected individuals changes, while at $\lambda=(\sqrt {5}-1)/2$ the
behavior of the expected number of remaining recovered individuals changes. We
also study the outbreak sizes of the infection, and show that the outbreak
sizes are small if $\lambda \in(0,1/2]$, exhibit a power-law behavior for
$1/2<\lambda<1$, and are pandemic for $\lambda\geq 1$. Our method relies on
different couplings: we first couple the dynamics with two independent Yule
processes by using an Athreya-Karlin embedding, and then we couple the Yule
processes with Poisson processes thanks to Kendall's representation of Yule
processes.

action through the auxiliary chiral superfield U. In such a formulation,
self-duality is equivalent to U(1) invariance of the U interaction. We
explicitly calculate the auxiliary interaction up to the 10th order and show
its U(1) duality invariance, thus proving that the original action is self-dual
to the same order. We also suggest a new method of recursive computation of the

many theories aiming to solve the hierarchy problem may thus require some
amount of tuning of the weak scale, hinting at a possible connection between
WIMP dark matter and unnaturalness. We point out that dark matter direct
detection is a very efficient probe of these unnatural models, and that
existing data already provide important clues to the nature of the associated
WIMPs. We present a model-independent, relativistic analysis of the signatures
of a gauge-singlet dark matter candidate of arbitrary spin, and discuss the
current experimental bounds from LUX and XENON100. For complex WIMPs, dark
matter direct detection is complementary to electroweak precision tests, and
can even compete with flavor constraints if the dark matter has spin.
Particularly relevant for future searches are couplings to the Higgs mass
operator, which are expected to be large if the electroweak scale is finely
tuned. Care is devoted to the RG evolution of the effective Lagrangian. We find
that the CP-even scalar coupling to charm quarks is enhanced by about 20%
compared to the one-loop estimate.
  When pushed in the unnatural regime, warped extra dimensions -- with or
without custodial symmetry -- become attractive theories for flavor, the Higgs
mass, and dark matter. The WIMP argument basically sets an upper bound on
unnaturalness, whereas direct detection experiments select scalar or real
particles as the most compelling dark matter candidates.

particular analysis of Planck data probing only the early cosmological

see if the {\Lambda}CDM model can fit all observational constraints probing
only the late cosmological background evolution, discarding any information
concerning the late perturbation evolution. We find that all tensions between

bias our parameter extraction and be the source of the alleged tensions.

a simple approach to encapsulate such common sense knowledge using
co-occurrence statistics from web documents. By merely counting the number of
times nouns (such as elephants, sharks, oceans, etc.) co-occur in web
documents, we obtain a good estimate of expected co-occurrences in visual data.
We then cast the problem of combining textual co-occurrence statistics with the
predictions of image-based classifiers as an optimization problem. The
resulting optimization problem serves as a surrogate for our inference
procedure. Albeit the simplicity of the resulting optimization problem, it is
effective in improving both recognition and localization accuracy. Concretely,
we observe significant improvements in recognition and localization rates for

A simple scalar captures the value of a state or of taking an action, where
expected future rewards increase and punishments decrease this quantity.
Naturally an agent should learn to predict this quantity to take beneficial
actions, and many value function approximators exist for this purpose. In the
present work, however, we show how value function approximators can cause
confusion between predictors of an outcome of one valence (e.g., a signal of
reward) and the inhibitor of the opposite valence (e.g., a signal canceling
expectation of punishment). We show this to be a problem for both linear and
non-linear value function approximators, especially when the amount of data (or
experience) is limited. We propose and evaluate a simple resolution: to instead
predict reward and punishment values separately, and rectify and add them to
get the value needed for decision making. We evaluate several function
approximators in this slightly different value function approximation
architecture and show that this approach is able to circumvent the confusion
and thereby achieve lower value-prediction errors.

when they form is still heavily debated. While disks around young stellar
objects have been identified through thermal dust emission, spatially and
spectrally resolved molecular line observations are needed to determine their
nature. We present subarcsecond observations of dust and gas toward four Class
I low-mass young stellar objects in Taurus. The 13CO and C18O J=2-1 transitions
at 220 GHz were observed with the Plateau de Bure Interferometer at a spatial
resolution of ~0.8'' and analyzed using uv-space position velocity diagrams to
determine the nature of their observed velocity radient. Rotationally supported
disks (RSDs) are detected around 3 of the 4 Class I sources studied. The
derived masses identify them as Stage I objects; i.e., their stellar mass is
higher than their envelope and disk masses. The outer radii of the Keplerian
disks toward our sample of Class I sources are <~ 100 AU. The lack of on-source
C18O emission for TMR1 puts an upper limit of 50 AU on its size. Flattened
structures at radii > 100 AU around these sources are dominated by infalling
motion (v propto r^-1). A large-scale envelope model is required to estimate
the basic parameters of the flattened structure from spatially resolved
continuum data. Similarities and differences between the gas and dust disk are
discussed. Combined with literature data, the sizes of the RSDs around Class I
objects are best described with evolutionary models with an initial rotation of
10^-14 Hz and slow sound speeds. Based on the comparison of gas and dust disk
masses, little CO is frozen out within 100 AU in these disks. RSDs with radii
up to 100 AU are present around Class I embedded objects. Larger surveys of
both Class 0 and I objects are needed to determine whether most disks form late
or early in the embedded phase.

CMIP3 GCMs show a varying degree of skill in simulating the basic
characteristics of the monsoonal precipitation regimes of the Ganges,

cycle over the Indus Basin is poor in most cases, with a few GCMs not capturing
the monsoonal signal at all. While the model outputs feature a remarkable
spread for the monsoonal precipitation, a satisfactory representation of the
western mid-latitude precipitation regime is instead observed. Similarly, most
of the models exhibit a satisfactory agreement for the basin-integrated runoff
in winter and spring, while their spread is large for the runoff during the
monsoon season. For the future climate scenarios, most models foresee a
decrease in the winter P - E over all four basins, while agreement is found on
the decrease of the spring P - E over the Indus and Ganges basins only. Such
decreases in P - E are mainly due to the decrease in precipitation associated
with the western mid-latitude disturbances. Consequently, for the Indus and

a $\rho(\omega) = |\omega|$ type local density of states. We also investigate
the impact of the correlation effects on the renormalization of the Fermi
velocity $v_F$. We find that $v_F$ is not renormalized when only on-site
repulsion $U$ is present, but that near-neighbor repulsion $V$ does renormalize
$v_F$. This may explain the variations between different measurements of $v_F$

environment through the hyperfine contact interaction. This interaction
combined with external control and relaxation or measurement of the electron
spin allows for the generation of dynamic nuclear polarization. The quantum
nature of the nuclear bath, along with the interplay of coherent external
fields and incoherent dynamics in these systems renders a wealth of intriguing
phenomena seen in recent experiments such as electron Zeeman frequency
focusing, hysteresis, and line dragging. We develop in detail a fully quantum,
self-consistent theory that can be applied to such experiments and that
moreover has predictive power. Our theory uses the operator sum representation
formalism in order to incorporate the incoherent dynamics caused by the
additional, Markovian bath, which in self-assembled dots is the vacuum field
responsible for electron-hole optical recombination. The beauty of this
formalism is that it reduces the complexity of the problem by encoding the
joint dynamics of the external coherent and incoherent driving in an effective
dynamical map that only acts on the electron spin subspace. This together with
the separation of timescales in the problem allows for a tractable and
analytically solvable formalism. The key role of entanglement between the
electron spin and the nuclear spins in the formation of dynamic nuclear
polarization naturally follows from our solution. We demonstrate the theory in

superluminal propagation of perturbations. It handles phantom-divide crossing

plane? This is an old and famously difficult question. One can generalize the
question in two ways: first, one may consider the {\em dielectric breakdown
model} $\eta$-DBM, a generalization of DLA in which particle locations are
sampled from the $\eta$-th power of harmonic measure, instead of harmonic
measure itself. Second, instead of restricting attention to deterministic
lattices, one may consider $\eta$-DBM on random graphs known or believed to
converge in law to a Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) surface with parameter
$\gamma \in [0,2]$.
  In this generality, we propose a scaling limit candidate called quantum
Loewner evolution, QLE$(\gamma^2, \eta)$. QLE is defined in terms of the radial
Loewner equation like radial SLE, except that it is driven by a measure valued
diffusion $\nu_t$ derived from LQG rather than a multiple of a standard
Brownian motion. We formalize the dynamics of $\nu_t$ using an SPDE. For each
$\gamma \in (0,2]$, there are two or three special values of $\eta$ for which
we establish the existence of a solution to these dynamics and explicitly
describe the stationary law of $\nu_t$.
  We also explain discrete versions of our construction that relate DLA to
loop-erased random walk and the Eden model to percolation. A certain
""reshuffling"" trick (in which concentric annular regions are rotated randomly,
like slot machine reels) facilitates explicit calculation.
  We propose QLE$(2,1)$ as a scaling limit for DLA on a random
spanning-tree-decorated planar map, and QLE$(8/3,0)$ as a scaling limit for the
Eden model on a random triangulation. We propose using QLE$(8/3,0)$ to endow
pure LQG with a distance function, by interpreting the region explored by a
branching variant of QLE$(8/3,0)$, up to a fixed time, as a metric ball in a
random metric space.

driven by quasi-stationary neutral gas flows in the solar chromosphere. The
role of these instabilities in the chromosphere is clarified. We find that the
destabilizing ion thermal effect is highly reduced by the Coulomb collisions
and can be ignored for the chromospheric FB-type instabilities. On the
contrary, the destabilizing electron thermal effect is important and causes a
significant reduction of the neutral drag velocity triggering the instability.
The resulting threshold velocity is found as function of chromospheric height.
Our results indicate that the FB type instabilities are still less efficient in
the global chromospheric heating than the Joule dissipation of the currents
driving these instabilities. This conclusion does not exclude the possibility
that the FB type instabilities develop in the places where the cross-field
currents overcome the threshold value and contribute to the heating locally.
Typical length-scales of plasma density fluctuations produced by these
instabilities are determined by the wavelengths of unstable modes, which are in
the range $10-10^2$ cm in the lower chromosphere, and $10^2-10^3$ cm in the
upper chromosphere. These results suggest that the decimetric radio waves
undergoing scattering (scintillations) by these plasma irregularities can serve
as a tool for remote probing of the solar chromosphere at different heights.

with a triangular cusp structure at the top, where the electrons were
efficiently accelerated. The sequence of HXR images allowed us to investigate
complicated changes in the precipitation of the accelerated electrons toward
the flare footpoints. We have shown that all these impulsive-phase observations
can be easily explained in terms of the model of electron acceleration in
oscillating magnetic traps located within the cusp structure. Some soft-X-ray
(SXR) images were available for the late decay phase. They show a long arcade
of SXR loops. Important information about the evolution of the flare during the
slow decay phase is contained in the time variation of the temperature, $T(t)$,
and emission measure, EM$(t)$. This information is the following: i) weak
heating occurs during the slow decay phase and it slowly decreases; ii) the
decrease in the heating determines slow and smooth decrease in EM; iii) the
coupling between the heating and the amount of the hot plasma makes the flare
evolve along a sequence of quasi-steady states during the slow decay phase (QSS
evolution).

nearly counter-aligned with the orbital angular momentum. We also observe that
the angle between S and L is nearly conserved during the inspiral phase. These
two dynamical properties allow us to propose a new phenomenological formula for
the final mass and spin of merged BHs in terms of the individual masses and
spins of the progenitor binary at far separations. We determine coefficients of
this formula (in the equal-mass limit) using a least-squares fit to the results

of features from miRNA precursors (pre-miRNA). These feature sets used by
current tools for pre-miRNA recognition differ in construction and dimension.
Some feature sets are composed of sequence-structure patterns commonly found in
pre-miRNAs, while others are a combination of more sophisticated RNA features.
Current tools achieve similar predictive performance even though the feature
sets used - and their computational cost - differ widely. In this work, we
analyze the discriminant power of seven feature sets, which are used in six
pre-miRNA prediction tools. The analysis is based on the classification
performance achieved with these feature sets for the training algorithms used
in these tools. We also evaluate feature discrimination through the F-score and
feature importance in the induction of random forests. More diverse feature
sets produce classifiers with significantly higher classification performance
compared to feature sets composed only of sequence-structure patterns. However,
small or non-significant differences were found among the estimated
classification performances of classifiers induced using sets with
diversification of features, despite the wide differences in their dimension.
Based on these results, we applied a feature selection method to reduce the
computational cost of computing the feature set, while maintaining discriminant
power. We obtained a lower-dimensional feature set, which achieved a
sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 95%. Our feature set achieves a
sensitivity and specificity within 0.1% of the maximal values obtained with any
feature set while it is 34x faster to compute. Even compared to another feature
set, which is the computationally least expensive feature set of those from the
literature which perform within 0.1% of the maximal values, it is 34x faster to
compute.

simulations have recently produced dynamical QCD results for the magnetic
polarizability of the neutron approaching the chiral regime. In order to
compare the lattice simulations with experiment, calculation of partial
quenching and finite-volume effects is required prior to an extrapolation in
quark mass to the physical point. These dependencies are described using chiral
effective field theory. Corrections to the partial quenching effects associated
with the sea-quark-loop electric charges are estimated by modelling corrections
to the pion cloud. These are compared to the uncorrected lattice results. In
addition, the behaviour of the finite-volume corrections as a function of pion
mass is explored. Box sizes of approximately 7 fm are required to achieve a
result within 5% of the infinite-volume result at the physical pion mass. A
variety of extrapolations are shown at different box sizes, providing a
benchmark to guide future lattice QCD calculations of the magnetic
polarizabilities. A relatively precise value for the physical magnetic
polarizability of the neutron is presented, beta_n = 1.93(11)stat(8)sys x 10^-4

$N$ were shown by Kurtz (1970, 1971) to be well approximated over finite time
intervals by the solution of the differential equations that describe their
average drift, and to exhibit stochastic fluctuations about this deterministic
solution on the scale $\sqrt N$ that can be approximated by a diffusion
process. Here, motivated by an example from evolutionary biology, we are
concerned with describing how such a process leaves an absorbing boundary.
Initially, one or more of the populations is of size much smaller than $N$, and
the length of time taken until all populations have sizes comparable to $N$
then becomes infinite as $N \to \infty$. Under suitable assumptions, we show
that in the early stages of development, up to the time when all populations
have sizes at least $N^{1-\alpha}$, for $1/3 < \alpha < 1$, the process can be
accurately approximated in total variation by a Markov branching process.
Thereafter, the process is well approximated by the deterministic solution
starting from the original initial point, but with a random time delay.
Analogous behaviour is also established for a Markov process approaching an

uncertain properties of dense neutron-rich matter. Its accurate determination
has significant ramifications in understanding not only the reaction dynamics
of heavy-ion reactions especially those induced by radioactive beams but also
many interesting phenomena in astrophysics, such as the explosion mechanism of
supernova and the properties of neutron stars. The heavy-ion physics community
has devoted much effort during the last few years to constrain the high-density
symmetry using various probes. In particular, the pion-/pion+ ratio has been
most extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally. All models have
consistently predicted qualitatively that the pion-/pion+ ratio is a sensitive
probe of the high-density symmetry energy especially with beam energies near
the pion production threshold. However, the predicted values of the pion-/pion+
ratio are still quite model dependent mostly because of the complexity of
modeling pion production and reabsorption dynamics in heavy-ion collisions,
leading to currently still controversial conclusions regarding the high-density
behavior of nuclear symmetry energy from comparing various model calculations
with available experimental data. As more pion-/pion+ data become available and
a deeper understanding about the pion dynamics in heavy-ion reactions is
obtained, more penetrating probes, such as the kaon+/kaon0 ratio, eta meson and
high energy photons are also being investigated or planned at several
facilities. Here, we review some of our recent contributions to the community
effort of constraining the high-density behavior of nuclear symmetry energy in
heavy-ion collisions. In addition, the status of some worldwide experiments for
studying the high-density symmetry energy, including the HIRFL-CSR external
target experiment (CEE) are briefly introduced.

that of the simplified AODV with CSMA/CA. The result is that BR has merits in
terms of number of hops to traverse the network. Considering the simple
structure of BR and its possible energy-efficiency, we can conclude that BR can
be a good candidate for sensor networks both under dynamic- and static

the Gemini-S telescope, respectively. By comparing the line strengths of the
NGC 5824 stars with those for red giants in clusters with well established
abundances, we conclude that there is an intrinsic abundance dispersion in NGC
5824 characterized by an inter-quartile range in [Fe/H] of 0.10 dex and a total
range of ~0.3 dex. As for omega-Cen and M22, the abundance distribution shows a
steep rise on the metal-poor side and a shallower decline on the metal-rich
side. There is also some indication that the distribution is not unimodal with
perhaps 3 distinct abundance groupings present. NGC 5824 has a further unusual
characteristic: the outer surface density profile shows no signs of a tidal
cutoff. Instead the profile has a power-law distribution with cluster stars
detected to a radius exceeding 400 pc. We postulate that NGC 5824 may be the
remnant nuclear star cluster of a now disrupted dwarf galaxy accreted during
the formation of the Galaxy's halo. We further speculate that the presence of
an intrinsic [Fe/H] spread is the characteristic that distinguishes former
nuclear star clusters from other globular clusters.

quasars as standard candles to construct a Hubble Diagram (HD) at z > 6. These
are (1) the recognition from reverberation mapping that a relationship exists
between the optical/UV luminosity and the distance of line-emitting gas from
the central ionizing source. Thus, together with a measurement of the velocity
of the line-emitting gas, e.g., via the width of BLR lines, such as Mg II, a
single observation can therefore in principle provide a determination of the
black hole's mass; and (2) the identification of quasar ULAS J1120+0641 at z =
7.085, which has significantly extended the redshift range of these sources,
providing essential leverage when fitting theoretical luminosity distances to
the data. In this paper, we use the observed fluxes and Mg II line-widths of
these sources to show that one may reasonably test the predicted high-z
distance versus redshift relationship, and we assemble a sample of 20 currently
available high-z quasars for this exercise. We find a good match between theory
and observations, suggesting that a more complete, high-quality survey may
indeed eventually produce an HD to complement the highly-detailed study already
underway (e.g., with Type Ia SNe, GRBs, and cosmic chronometers) at lower
redshifts. With the modest sample we have here, we show that the R_h=ct
Universe and LCDM both fit the data quite well, though the smaller number of
free parameters in the former produces a more favorable outcome when we
calculate likelihoods using the Akaike, Kullback, and Bayes Information
Criteria. These three statistical tools result in similar probabilities,
indicating that the R_h=ct Universe is more likely than LCDM to be correct, by
a ratio of about 85% to 15%.

survey provides a deep census of 1612-, 1665-, 1667- and 1720-MHz OH absorption
and emission from the Galactic ISM, and is also an unbiased search for maser
sources in these transitions. We present here first results from the SPLASH
pilot region, which covers Galactic longitudes 334 to 344 degrees and latitudes
of -2 to +2 degrees. Diffuse OH is widely detected in all four transitions,
with optical depths that are always small (averaged over the Parkes beam), and
with departures from LTE common even in the 1665- and 1667-MHz main lines. To a
3$\sigma$ sensitivity of 30 mK, we find no evidence of OH envelopes extending
beyond the CO-bright regions of molecular cloud complexes, and conclude that
the similarity of the OH excitation temperature and the level of the continuum
background is at least partly responsible for this. We detect masers and maser
candidates in all four transitions, approximately 50 per cent of which are new
detections. This implies that SPLASH will produce a substantial increase in the

result, in the case of the balance number of sublattices, it will suppress

are completely avoidable in the description of pure high spin-$j$ Weinberg-Joos
states, $(j,0)\oplus (0,j)$. The case is made on the example of
$(3/2,0)\oplus(0,3/2)$, for the sake of concreteness and without loss of
generality. Namely, we use as a vehicle for the aforementioned covariant single
spin-$3/2$ description the antisymmetric tensor of second rank with Dirac
spinor components, $\Psi_{[\mu\nu]}=B_{[\mu\nu]}\otimes\psi$. The
$(3/2,0)\oplus(0,3/2)$ sector of interest is tracked down in two steps. First
we search for spin-$3/2$ by means of a covariant spin projector constructed
from the Casimir invariants of the Poincar\'e algebra, and then we identify the
wanted irreducible representation space by means of a momentum independent
(static) projector designed on the basis of the Casimir invariants of the
Lorentz algebra. The latter projectors unambiguously identify any irreducible
$so(1,3)$ subspace of any Lorentz tensor and without rising the order of the
differential equation. The method proposed correctly reproduces the
electromagnetic multipole moments earlier calculated for single spin-$3/2$
particles in treating it in the standard way as eight dimensional spinor. We
furthermore calculate Compton scattering off the pure spin-$3/2$ under
discussion, and show that the differential cross section satisfies unitarity in
forward direction for a gyromagnetic ratio of $g=2/3$. Suggesting possible
validity of Belinfante's conjecture for pure spin-states, while the natural
value of $g=2$ seems more likely to characterize the highest spins in the
Rarita-Schwinger representation spaces. The scheme straightforwardly extends to
any $(j,0)\oplus (0,j)$ Weinberg-Joos state and brings the advantage of
avoiding rectangular matrix couplings between states of different spins,
replacing them by simple Lorentz contractions.

the breaking of conformal invariance of the Electromagnetic action. In this
paper this has been achieved naturally in a higher dimensional cosmological
model with a Gauss-Bonnet term in the action. The evolution of the scale factor
of the extra dimension (whose dynamics is influenced by the Gauss-Bonnet term)
acts as the cause for the breaking of conformal invariance. Different cases
have been investigated, each of which is characterized by the number of higher
dimensions, the value of the Gauss-Bonnet parameter, and the cosmological
constant. Many of the scenarios considered are highly constrained by the
requirements that the cosmic evolution is stable, that the normal dimensions
expand and that there is no back reaction due to growing electric fields.
However there do exist scenarios which satisfy the above requirements and are
well suited for magnetogenesis. In particular, a scenario where the number of
extra dimensions $D=4$ and the cosmological constant is non-zero, turns out to
be best suited for generating primordial magnetic fields. It is shown that for
these values of parameters, a scale invariant magnetic field of the order of
$10^{-10}-10^{-9}$ $G$ can be produced. Even in these most favorable scenarios,
the higher dimensional space expands during inflation at the same rate as the
normal dimension. Hence if a mechanism could freeze the evolution of the higher
dimension, this seems to be a viable mechanism to produce acceptable primordial
magnetic fields.

the remaining $82\%$ magnetic features which cover the majority of network

spectral evolution of the outburst, investigating whether the evolution of the
jet spectral break (the transition between optically-thick and optically-thin
synchrotron emission) is caused by any specific properties of the accretion
flow. Our observations show that the break does not scale with the X-ray
luminosity or with the inner radius of the accretion disk, and is instead
likely to be set by much more complex processes. We find that the radius of the
acceleration zone at the base of the jet decreases from ~10$^6$ gravitational
radii during the hard intermediate state to ~10$^3$ gravitational radii as the
outburst fades (assuming a black hole mass of 8 M$_{\odot}$), demonstrating
that the electrons are accelerated on much larger scales than the radius of the
inner accretion disk and that the jet properties change significantly during
outburst. From our broadband modelling and high-resolution optical spectra, we
argue that early in the outburst, the high-energy synchrotron cooling break was
located in the optical band, between $\approx 3.2 \times 10^{14}$ Hz and $4.5
\times 10^{14}$ Hz. We calculate that the jet has a total radiative power of
$\approx 3.1 \times 10^{36}$ ergs s$^{-1}$, which is ~6% of the bolometric
radiative luminosity at this time. We discuss how this cooling break may evolve
during the outburst, and how that evolution dictates the total jet radiative
power. Assuming the source is a stellar-mass black hole with canonical state
transitions, from the measured flux and peak temperature of the disk component
we constrain the source distance to be 4-10 kpc.

been argued that an effective naked singularity, called the visible border of
spacetime, would be generated by high-energy particle collisions. Motivated by
this interesting possibility, we investigate a particle creation by a naked
singularity in general dimensions, adopting a spherically symmetric
self-similar dust collapse as the simple model of a naked singularity
formation. The power and energy of the particle emission behave in two distinct
ways depending on a parameter in the model. In a generic case, the emission
power is proportional to the quadratic inverse of the remaining time to the
Cauchy horizon, which has been known for the four-dimensional case in the
literature. On the other hand, in a degenerate case the emission power is
proportional to the quartic inverse of the remaining time to the Cauchy
horizon, and depends on the total mass of a dust fluid in spite that the
central region of the collapse is scale-free due to the self-similarity. In the
both cases, within a test-field approximation the energy radiated before any
quantum gravitational effect dominates amounts to TeV. This suggests that a
backreaction is not ignorable in the TeV-scale gravity context, in contrast to
the similar phenomena in stellar collapse.

digital nets over $\mathbb{Z}_b$ in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. The tent
transformation, or the baker's transformation, was originally used for lattice
rules by Hickernell (2002) to achieve higher order convergence of the
integration error for smooth non-periodic integrands, and later, has been
successfully applied to digital nets over $\mathbb{Z}_2$ by Cristea et al.
(2007) and Goda (2014). The aim of this paper is to generalize the latter two
results to digital nets over $\mathbb{Z}_b$ for an arbitrary prime $b$. For
this purpose, we introduce the {\em $b$-adic tent transformation} for an
arbitrary positive integer $b$ greater than 1, which is a generalization of the
original (dyadic) tent transformation. Further, again for an arbitrary positive
integer $b$ greater than 1, we analyze the mean square worst-case error of QMC
rules using digital nets over $\mathbb{Z}_b$ which are randomly digitally
shifted and then folded using the $b$-adic tent transformation in reproducing
kernel Hilbert spaces. Using this result, for a prime $b$, we prove the
existence of good higher order polynomial lattice rules over $\mathbb{Z}_b$
among the smaller number of candidates as compared to the result by Dick and
Pillichshammer (2007), which achieve almost the optimal convergence rate of the

Training a large convolutional network to produce state-of-the-art results can
take weeks, even when using modern GPUs. Producing labels using a trained

we present a simple algorithm which accelerates training and inference by a

reusing the same transformed feature map many times. The algorithm is

spherical multiscale expansions: First, a convolution with a scaling kernel
$\Phi_N$ deals with the downward continuation from $\Omega_R$ to $\Omega_r$,
while in a second step, the result is locally refined by a convolution on

multiscale approaches, it is not the primary goal to obtain an adaptive spatial
localization but to simultaneously optimize the related kernels $\Phi_N$,
$\tilde{\Psi}_N$ in such a way that the former behaves well for the downward
continuation while the latter shows a good localization on $\Omega_r$ in the
region where data is available. The concept is indicated for scalar as well as

probabilities are generally representative of contamination rates, except when
a parallax measurement is considered. In this case contamination rates become
significantly smaller and hence Bayesian probabilities for NYA memberships are
pessimistic. We apply this new algorithm to a sample of 158 objects from the

have unusually red near-infrared colors for their spectral type. Based on our

to the formation of bow shocks ahead of the star where the stellar wind

shock of $\alpha$-Orionis show that the shock is almost free of instabilities,
despite being, at least in theory, subject to both Kelvin-Helmholtz and
Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. A possible explanation for the lack of

to investigate whether the magnetic field of the interstellar medium (ISM) in
the Orion arm can inhibit the growth of instabilities in the bow shock of
$\alpha$-Orionis. We used the code MPI-AMRVAC to make magneto-hydrodynamic
simulations of a circumstellar bow shock, using the wind parameters derived for
$\alpha$-Orionis and interstellar magnetic field strengths of $B\,=\,1.4,\,
3.0$, and $5.0\, \mu$G, which fall within the boundaries of the observed
magnetic field strength in the Orion arm of the Milky Way. Our results show
that even a relatively weak magnetic field in the interstellar medium can
suppress the growth of Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities,
which occur along the contact discontinuity between the shocked wind and the
shocked ISM. The presence of even a weak magnetic field in the ISM effectively
inhibits the growth of instabilities in the bow shock. This may explain the

from the field equations in this approximation of the star product. The higher
spin algebra is then realized in terms of classical variables which leads to
certain important simplifications that we take advantage of. The suggested
structure of the all-spin Lagrangian given here is, however, obtained using an
expansion of the star product beyond the Poisson bracket in terms of
multi-commutators and the Lagrangian should be viewed as a starting point for
the derivation of the full theory based on a star product. How to do this is
explained as well as how to include the coupling to scalar fields. We also
comment on the AdS/CFT relation to four dimensions.

enables the construction of schemes that are free of nonlinear Riemann solvers
and are independent of the underlying eigenstructure of the problem. The
constant relaxation schemes proposed by Jin & Xin can however introduce strong
numerical diffusion, especially when the maximum characteristic speeds are high
compared to the average speeds in the domain. We propose a general class of
variable relaxation formulations for multidimensional systems of conservation
laws which utilizes estimates of local maximum and minimum speeds to arrive at
more accurate relaxation schemes, irrespective of the contrast in maximum and
average characteristic speeds. First and second order variable relaxation
methods are presented for general nonlinear systems in one and two spatial
dimensions, along with monotonicity and TVD (Total Variation Diminishing)
properties for the 1D schemes. The effectiveness of the schemes is demonstrated
on a test suite that includes Burgers' equation, the weakly hyperbolic
Engquist-Runborg problem, as well as the weakly hyperbolic gas injection
displacements that are governed by strong nonlinear coupling thus making them
highly sensitive to numerical diffusion. In the latter examples the second
order Jin-Xin scheme fails to capture the fronts reasonably, when both the
first and second order variable relaxed schemes produce the displacement

for numerical approximations in space and time of semilinear parabolic
stochastic evolution equations driven by Gaussian additive noise. In
particular, we combine a standard Galerkin finite element method with backward
Euler timestepping. The method of proof does not rely on the use of the
Kolmogorov equation or the It\={o} formula and is therefore non-Markovian in

assumptions are allowed, meaning in particular that we prove convergence of
arbitrary moments with essentially optimal rate.

own observations, all made with instrumentation attached to the 10.4m Gran

Altogether, the data cover a full 3-month period of observations which can be
explained by an intermittent dust loss. The most plausible scenario is that of
an asteroid rotating with the spinning axis oriented perpendicular to the orbit
plane and loosing mass from the equatorial region, consistent with a rotational
break-up. Assuming that the ejection velocity of the particles

opportunity to investigate experimentally some mechanisms thought to be
responsible for planet and planetesimal formation in protoplanetary discs. Here
we extended the comparison of our numerical models of Prometheus encountering
the F ring employing non-interacting and interacting particles. Higher
resolution analysis revealed that the density increases known to exist at
channel edges is more complex and localised than previously thought. Asymmetry
between density increases on channel edges revealed that the channel edge
facing way from Prometheus to be the most stable but with lowest maximum
increases. However, on the channel edge facing Prometheus the interacting model
showed large chaotic fluctuations in the maximum density of some clumps, much
larger than those of the other channel. The likely cause of this asymmetry is a
variance in localised turbulence introduced into the F ring by Prometheus. High
resolution velocity dispersion maps showed that there was a spatial link
between the highest densities and the highest velocity dispersions in the
interacting model. Thus suggesting that the high velocity dispersion we see is
the reason for the observed inhomogeneous distribution of fans (evidence of
embedded moonlets) on some of the channel edges facing Prometheus.

ocean data is distorted such that three- and four-dimensional (i.e.,
time-dependent) in situ data are very sparse, while observations of surface and
upper ocean properties from space-borne platforms have become abundant in the
past few decades. Precisions in observations of all types vary as well. In the

proven to be a fruitful area for research and the development of useful models.

perspective has become increasingly productive. As examples, we review a
heterogeneous mix of studies from our own work demonstrating Bayesian
hierarchical model applications in ocean physics, air-sea interaction, ocean

towards the optimization of data exchange settings. We refer to a natural
notion of containment that relies on the behaviour of schema mappings with
respect to conjunctive query answering, in the presence of so-called LAV TGDs
as target constraints. Our contribution is a practical technique for testing
the containment based on the existence of a homomorphism between special

cases, and we set the basis for further investigations in the topic. This paper
extends our preliminary results.

representing the domain of interest, in order to answer queries one needs to
consider the logical theory consisting of both the data and the constraints.
Query answering in such a context is called ontological query answering.
Commonly adopted database constraints in this field are tuple-generating
dependencies (TGDs) and equality-generating dependencies (EGDs). It is well
known that their interaction leads to intractability or undecidability of query
answering even in the case of simple subclasses. Several conditions have been
found to guarantee separability, that is lack of interaction, between TGDs and
EGDs. Separability makes EGDs (mostly) irrelevant for query answering and
therefore often guarantees tractability, as long as the theory is satisfiable.
In this paper we review the two notions of separability found in the
literature, as well as several syntactic conditions that are sufficient to
prove them. We then shed light on the issue of satisfiability checking, showing
that under a sufficient condition called deep separability it can be done by
considering the TGDs only.
  We show that, fortunately, in the case of TGDs and EGDs, separability implies
deep separability. This result generalizes several analogous ones, proved ad
hoc for particular classes of constraints. Applications include the class of
sticky TGDs and EGDs, for which we provide a syntactic separability condition
which extends the analogous one for linear TGDs; preliminary experiments show
the feasibility of query answering in this case.

Transmission in the THz regime is dependent almost exclusively on atmospheric

high for good transmission above 200 GHz, there are a number of dry sites with
very low attenuation. We performed a global analysis of PWV with
high-resolution measurements from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer

common THz windows for astronomical and satellite communications scenarios.

suggestions that an intermediate-mass companion ejects the envelope, and then
is shredded by the Roche-lobe overflow to its current low-mass. But this

star-integrated variability amplitudes for 508 stars with photometric light
curves measured by the Kepler mission. We also derive an empirical correction
factor that aims to account for the suppression of convection in F-dwarf stars
with magnetic activity and shallow convection zones. So that we can make
predictions of specific observational quantities, we performed Monte Carlo
simulations of granulation light curves using a Lorentzian power spectrum.
These simulations allowed us to reproduce the so-called ""flicker floor"" (i.e.,
a lower bound in the relationship between the full light-curve range and power
in short-timescale fluctuations) that was found in the Kepler data. The Monte
Carlo model also enabled us to convert the modeled fluctuation variance into a
flicker amplitude directly comparable with observations. When the magnetic

derive an effective Hamiltonian that is unitarily equivalent to the restriction

leading order, our effective Hamiltonian can be interpreted as the Peierls
substitution Hamiltonian widely used in physics for non-magnetic Bloch bands.
However, while for non-magnetic Bloch bands the corresponding result is well
understood, for magnetic Bloch bands it is not clear how to even define a
Peierls substitution Hamiltonian beyond a formal expression. The source of the
difficulty is a topological obstruction: magnetic Bloch bundles are generically
not trivializable. As a consequence, Peierls substitution Hamiltonians for
magnetic Bloch bands turn out to be pseudodifferential operators acting on
sections of non-trivial vector bundles over a two-torus, the reduced Brillouin
zone. Part of our contribution is the construction of a suitable Weyl calculus
for such pseudos. As an application of our results we construct a new family of
canonical one-band Hamiltonians $H^B_{\theta,q}$ for magnetic Bloch bands with
Chern number $\theta\in \mathbb{Z}$ that generalizes the Hofstadter model

close to the saturation field using the dilute Bose gas theory, where the
magnetic structure is determined by the condensation of magnons. We focus on
the case of ferromagnetic $J_1$ and antiferromagnetic $J_2,J_3$, that is
particularly rich because frustration effects allow the single-magnon energy
dispersion to have six-fold degenerate minima at incommensurate momenta. Our
calculation also includes an interlayer coupling $J_0$, which covers both
antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic cases including negligibly small regime
(two-dimensional case). Besides the spiral and fan phases, we find a new
double-$q$ phase (superposition of two modes), dubbed ""${\bf Q}_0$-${\bf Q}_1$""
(or simply ""01"") phase, that enjoys a new type of multiferroic character.
Certain phase boundaries have a singular $J_0$ dependence for $J_0\to 0$,
implying that even a very small interlayer coupling drastically changes the
ground state. A mechanism for this singularity is presented. Moreover, in some
regions of the parameter space, we show that a dilute gas of magnons can not be
stable, and phase separation (corresponding to a magnetization jump) is
expected. In the $J_1$-$J_2$ model ($J_3=0$), formation of two-magnon bound
states is observed, which can lead to a quadrupolar (spin-nematic) ordered
phase. Exact diagonalization analysis is also applied to the search of bound
states.

complete 3-vertex graph $K_3$. The last condition can be checked by a
$k$-consistency algorithm where the parameter $k$ has to be chosen large
enough, dependent on $G$. Let $W(G)$ denote the minimum $k$ sufficient for this
purpose. For a non-3-colorable graph $G$, $W(G)$ is equal to the minimum $k$
such that $G$ can be distinguished from $K_3$ in the $k$-variable
existential-positive first-order logic. We define the dynamic width of the
3-colorability problem as the function $W(n)=\max_G W(G)$, where the maximum is
taken over all non-3-colorable $G$ with $n$ vertices.
  The assumption $\mathrm{NP}\ne\mathrm{P}$ implies that $W(n)$ is unbounded.
Indeed, a lower bound $W(n)=\Omega(\log\log n/\log\log\log n)$ follows
unconditionally from the work of Nesetril and Zhu on bounded treewidth duality.
The Exponential Time Hypothesis implies a much stronger bound
$W(n)=\Omega(n/\log n)$ and indeed we unconditionally prove that
$W(n)=\Omega(n)$. In fact, an even stronger statement is true: A first-order
sentence distinguishing any 3-colorable graph on $n$ vertices from any
non-3-colorable graph on $n$ vertices must have $\Omega(n)$ variables.
  On the other hand, we observe that $W(G)\le 3\,\alpha(G)+1$ and $W(G)\le
n-\alpha(G)+1$ for every non-3-colorable graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, where
$\alpha(G)$ denotes the independence number of $G$. This implies that
$W(n)\le\frac34\,n+1$, improving on the trivial upper bound $W(n)\le n$.
  We also show that $W(G)>\frac1{16}\, g(G)$ for every non-3-colorable graph
$G$, where $g(G)$ denotes the girth of $G$.
  Finally, we consider the function $W(n)$ over planar graphs and prove that
$W(n)=\Theta(\sqrt n)$ in the case.

combining (MRC) in the presence of interference is not well understood. Because
the interference received at each antenna originates from the same set of
interferers, but partially de-correlates over the fading channel, it possesses
a complex correlation structure. This work develops a realistic analytic model
that accurately accounts for the interference correlation using stochastic
geometry. Modeling interference by a Poisson shot noise process with
independent Nakagami fading, we derive the link success probability for
dual-branch interference-aware MRC. Using this result, we show that the common
assumption that all receive antennas experience equal interference power
underestimates the true performance, although this gap rapidly decays with
increasing the Nakagami parameter $m_{\text{I}}$ of the interfering links. In
contrast, ignoring interference correlation leads to a highly optimistic
performance estimate for MRC, especially for large $m_{\text{I}}$. In the low
outage probability regime, our success probability expression can be
considerably simplified. Observations following from the analysis include: (i)
for small path loss exponents, MRC and minimum mean square error combining
exhibit similar performance, and (ii) the gains of MRC over selection combining
are smaller in the interference-limited case than in the well-studied
noise-limited case.

  The main topics of the workshop were Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) and
Model-driven Software Development (MDSD) for robotics. A domain-specific
language is a programming language dedicated to a particular problem domain
that offers specific notations and abstractions that increase programmer
productivity within that domain. Model-driven software development offers a
high-level way for domain users to specify the functionality of their system at
the right level of abstraction. DSLs and models have historically been used for
programming complex systems. However recently they have garnered interest as a
separate field of study. Robotic systems blend hardware and software in a
holistic way that intrinsically raises many crosscutting concerns (concurrency,
uncertainty, time constraints, ...), for which reason, traditional
general-purpose languages often lead to a poor fit between the language
features and the implementation requirements. DSLs and models offer a powerful,
systematic way to overcome this problem, enabling the programmer to quickly and
precisely implement novel software solutions to complex problems within the
robotics domain.

on the lunar calendar. This is traditionally undertaken with visual
observations. We propose a radio method which allows a higher visibility of the
Moon relative to the Sun and consequently gives us the ability to detect the
Moon much closer to the Sun than is the case of visual observation. We first
compare the relative brightness of the Moon and Sun over a range of possible
frequencies and find the range 5--100\,GHz to be suitable. The next
consideration is the atmospheric absorption/emission due to water vapour and
oxygen as a function of frequency. This is particularly important since the
relevant observations are near the horizon. We show that a frequency of $\sim
10$ GHz is optimal for this programme. We have designed and constructed a
telescope with a FWHM resolution of 0$^\circ{}\!\!$.6 and low sidelobes to
demonstrate the potential of this approach. At the time of the 21 May 2012 New
Moon the Sun/Moon brightness temperature ratio was $72.7 \pm 2.2$ in agreement
with predictions from the literature when combined with the observed sunspot
numbers for the day. The Moon would have been readily detectable at $\sim
2^{\circ}$ from the Sun. Our observations at 16\,hr\,36\,min UT indicated that
the Moon would have been at closest approach to the Sun 16\,hr\,25\,min
earlier; this was the annular solar eclipse of 00\,hr\,00\,min\,UT on 21 May
2012.

popularity among bioinformaticians. It has evolved from the exponential-normal
convolution to the gamma-normal convolution, from single to two channels and
from the Affymetrix to the Illumina platform.
  The Illumina design has provided two probe types: the regular and the control
probes. This design is very suitable for studying the probability distribution
of both and one can apply the convolution model to compute the true intensity
estimator. The availability of benchmarking data set at Illumina platform, the
{\it Illumina spike-in}, helps researchers to evaluate their proposed method
for Illumina BeadArrays.
  In this paper, we study the existing convolution models for background
correction of Illumina BeadArrays in the literature and give a new estimator
for the true intensity, where the intensity value is exponentially or gamma
distributed and the noise has lognormal distribution. We compare the
performance of the models on the Illumina spike-in data set, based on various
criteria, for example, root and mean square error, $L_{1}$ error,
Kullback-Leibler coefficient, and some adapted criteria from Affycomp
\cite{Cop04}. We then provide a simulation study to measure the consistency of
the error of background correction and the parametrization. We also study the
performance of all models on the FFPE data set.
  Our study shows that our GLNn model is the optimal one for the benchmarking
data set with benchmarking criteria, while the gamma-normal model has the best
performance for the benchmarking data set with simulation criteria. At the
public data set of FFPE, the gamma-normal and the exponential-gamma models with
MLE cannot be used and our proposed models ELN and GLN have the best
performance, showing a moderate error in background correction and in the
parametrization.

We obtain a two-degree of freedom system, associated with the two critical

classically referred to as Corotation Eccentric resonance (CER) and Lindblad
Eccentric Resonance (LER), respectively. We write the four reduced equations of
motion near the CER and LER, that form what we call the CoraLin model. This
model depends upon only two dimensionless parameters that control the dynamics
of the system: the distance $D$ between the CER and LER, and a forcing
parameter $\epsilon_L$ that includes both the mass and the orbital eccentricity
of the disturbing satellite. Three regimes are found: for $D=0$ the system is
integrable, for $D$ of order unity, it exhibits prominent chaotic regions,
while for $D$ large compared to 2, the behavior of the system is regular and
can be qualitatively described using simple adiabatic invariant arguments. We
apply this model to three recently discovered small Saturnian satellites

Aegaeon, Methone and Anthe.

reduced phase-space, all higher spin gauge fields can be written as
bi-hamiltonian systems. The role of the second hamiltonian is played by the

asymptotic symmetries and their applications to holography. After a review of

The framework is Wheeler-DeWitt quantization applied to homogeneous and
isotropic universes with a perfect fluid described by a generalized Chaplygin
gas. Such a fluid can be dynamically realized by a scalar field. We treat the
cases of a standard scalar field with positive kinetic energy and of a scalar
field with negative energy (phantom field). We first present the classical
solutions. We then discuss in detail the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for these
models. We are able to give analytic solutions for a special case and to draw
conclusions for the general case. Adopting the criterion that singularities are
avoided if the wave function vanishes in the region of the classical
singularity, we find that type IV singularities are avoided only for particular
solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. We compare this result with earlier
results found for other types of singularities.

in terms of probability fields of free particles subject to self-interference,
without using Schr\""{o}dinger equation or wavefunctions. Unlike the standard QM
picture, the proposed model only uses integer-valued quantities and arithmetic
operations. In particular, it assumes a discrete spacetime under the form of an
euclidean lattice. The proposed approach describes individual particle
trajectories as random walks. Transition probabilities are simple functions of
a few quantities that are either randomly associated to the particles during
their preparation, or stored in the lattice sites they visit during the walk.
Non-relativistic QM predictions, particularly self-interference, are retrieved
as probability distributions of similarly-prepared ensembles of particles.
Extension to interacting particles is discussed but not detailed in this paper.

homogeneous depth 4 arithmetic circuits. We give an explicit polynomial in VNP
of degree $n$ in $n^2$ variables such that any homogeneous depth 4 arithmetic
circuit computing it must have size $n^{\Omega(\log \log n)}$.
  Our results extend the works of Nisan-Wigderson [NW95] (which showed
superpolynomial lower bounds for homogeneous depth 3 circuits),
Gupta-Kamath-Kayal-Saptharishi and Kayal-Saha-Saptharishi [GKKS13, KSS13]

Raz-Yehudayoff and Fournier-Limaye-Malod-Srinivasan [RY08, FLMS13] (which
showed superpolynomial lower bounds for multilinear depth 4 circuits). Several
of these results in fact showed exponential lower bounds.
  The main ingredient in our proof is a new complexity measure of {\it bounded
support} shifted partial derivatives. This measure allows us to prove
exponential lower bounds for homogeneous depth 4 circuits where all the
monomials computed at the bottom layer have {\it bounded support} (but possibly
unbounded degree/fan-in), strengthening the results of Gupta et al and Kayal et
al [GKKS13, KSS13]. This new lower bound combined with a careful ""random
restriction"" procedure (that transforms general depth 4 homogeneous circuits to
depth 4 circuits with bounded support) gives us our final result.

intrinsic reddenings of $E(B-V)=0.13$, 0.15, and 0.13, and cluster masses of
$1.7\times10^5$, $1.4\times10^5$, and $1.1\times10^5$ M$_\odot$, respectively.

seen in star-forming galaxies, and have Wolf-Rayet (WR) to O star ratios of

There is a finite number of players who repeatedly update from a finite number

long-run distribution of states and show that, for sufficiently small mutation
probability, its support is limited to efficient communication systems. We find
that this behavior is insensitive to the particular choice of evolutionary
dynamic, a property that is due to the game having a potential structure with a
potential function corresponding to average fitness. Consequently, the model
supports conclusions similar to those found in the literature on language
competition. That is, we show that efficient languages eventually predominate
the society while reproducing the empirical phenomenon of linguistic drift. The
emergence of efficiency in the atomic case can be contrasted with results for
non-atomic signaling games that establish the non-negligible possibility of
convergence, under replicator dynamics, to states of unbounded efficiency loss.

information transmission and calculational speed-up by employing quantum
coherence and entanglement to store, transmit, and process information. A
promising platform for implementing such a network are atom-based quantum
memories and processors, interconnected by photonic quantum channels. A crucial
building block in this scenario is the conversion of quantum states between
single photons and single atoms through controlled emission and absorption.
Here we present an experimental protocol for photon-to-atom quantum state
conversion, whereby the polarization state of an absorbed photon is mapped onto
the spin state of a single absorbing atom with >95% fidelity, while successful
conversion is heralded by a single emitted photon. Heralded high-fidelity
conversion without affecting the converted state is a main experimental
challenge, in order to make the transferred information reliably available for
further operations. We record >80/s successful state transfer events out of
18,000/s repetitions.

useful description of the electrical double layer in microporous carbon
electrodes, suitable for incorporation in porous electrode theory. By
postulating an attractive excess chemical potential for each ion in the
micropores that is inversely proportional to the total ion concentration, we
show that experimental data for capacitive deionization (CDI) can be accurately
predicted over a wide range of applied voltages and salt concentrations. Since
the ion spacing and Bjerrum length are each comparable to the micropore size
(few nm), we postulate that the attraction results from fluctuating bare
Coulomb interactions between individual ions and the metallic pore surfaces
(image forces) that are not captured by meanfield theories, such as the
Poisson-Boltzmann-Stern model or its mathematical limit for overlapping double
layers, the Donnan model. Using reasonable estimates of the micropore
permittivity and mean size (and no other fitting parameters), we propose a
simple theory that predicts the attractive chemical potential inferred from
experiments. As additional evidence for attractive forces, we present data for
salt adsorption in uncharged microporous carbons, also predicted by the theory.

frequency reserves. There are economical and technical benefits of instead
using energy constrained units such as storage systems and demand response, but
so far they have not been widely adopted as their energy constraints prevent
them from following traditional regulation signals, which sometimes are biased
over long time-spans. This paper proposes a frequency control framework that
splits the control signals according to the frequency spectrum. This guarantees
that all control signals are zero-mean over well-defined time-periods, which is
a crucial requirement for the usage of energy-constraint units such as
batteries. A case-study presents a possible implementation, and shows how
different technologies with widely varying characteristics can all participate

extensively used to prove the universality of numerous computational models.
Unfortunately, all known algorithms give universal 2-tag systems that have a
large number of symbols. In this work, tag systems with only 2 symbols (the
minimum possible) are proved universal via an intricate construction showing
that they simulate cyclic tag systems. Our simulation algorithm has a
polynomial time overhead, and thus shows that binary tag systems simulate
Turing machines in polynomial time.
  We immediately find applications of our result. We reduce the halting problem
for binary tag systems to the Post correspondence problem for 4 pairs of words.
This improves on 7 pairs, the previous bound for undecidability in this
problem. Following our result, only the case for 3 pairs of words remains open,
as the problem is known to be decidable for 2 pairs. As a further application,
we find that the matrix mortality problem is undecidable for sets with five
$3\times 3$ matrices and for sets with two $15\times 15$ matrices. The previous
bounds for the undecidability in this problem was seven $3\times 3$ matrices

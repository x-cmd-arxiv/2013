have studied the behavior of the jackknife estimate of bias under different
configurations of the censoring level, sample size, and the censoring and
survival time distributions. The empirical research reveals some new findings
about robust calculation of the bias, particularly for higher censoring levels.
We have extended their jackknifing approach to cover the case where the largest

handle. This paper is about cubic sand grains moving around on nicely packed
columns in one dimension (the physical sandpile is two dimensional, but the
support of sand columns is one dimensional). The Kadanoff Sandpile Model is a
discrete dynamical system describing the evolution of a finite number of
stacked grains --as they would fall from an hourglass-- to a stable
configuration (fixed point). Grains move according to the repeated application
of a simple local rule until reaching a fixed point. The main interest of the
model relies in the difficulty of understanding its behavior, despite the
simplicity of the rule. In this paper we prove the emergence of wave patterns
periodically repeated on fixed points. Remarkably, those regular patterns do
not cover the entire fixed point, but eventually emerge from a seemingly highly
disordered segment. The proof technique we set up associates arguments of
linear algebra and combinatorics, which interestingly allow to formally state
the emergence of regular patterns without requiring a precise understanding of
the chaotic initial segment's dynamic.

  Symposium of the International Conference on High Performance Computing

the introduction of multimedia sensor networks, which has a major bottleneck in
the form of network congestion. Congestion occurs when resources are in high
demand during the active period while the data processing and transmission
speeds lag behind the speed of the incoming traffic. This may disrupt normal
network operations by buffer overflow, packet loss, increased latency,
excessive energy consumption and even worse, a collapse of the entire
operation. In this paper we propose a novel Trust Integrated Congestion-aware
Energy Efficient Routing algorithm (TCEER) in which the potential of a node is
computed using its trust value, congestion status, residual energy, distance
from the current packet-forwarding node and the distance from the base station
using a Fuzzy Logic Controller. The source node selects the node of highest
potential in its one hop radio range for data transmission. Hop by hop data
routing from source to base station is obtained which is light-weight as well
as energy-efficient. Finally, the merits of the proposed scheme are discussed
by comparing it with the existing protocols and the study shows promising
improvements in network performance.

``incremental""; that is, the decision maker is permitted to change the initial

Hence, it is solvable in polynomial time. We establish the NP-hardness for
robust incremental linear programming for the case of a discrete uncertainty
set. We show that the robust incremental shortest path problem is NP-complete
when costs are chosen from a polyhedral uncertainty set, even in the case that
only one new arc may be added to the initial path. We also address the

Wireless Sensor Networks, especially for large networks, where the traffic
loads exceed the available capacity of the resources. Sensor nodes are prone to
failure and the misbehavior of these faulty nodes creates further congestion.
The resulting effect is a degradation in network performance, additional
computation and increased energy consumption, which in turn decreases network
lifetime. Hence, the data packet routing algorithm should consider congestion
as one of the parameters, in addition to the role of the faulty nodes and not
merely energy efficient protocols. Unfortunately most of the researchers have
tried to make the routing schemes energy efficient without considering
congestion factor and the effect of the faulty nodes. In this paper we have
proposed a congestion aware, energy efficient, routing approach that utilizes

of the concept of trust. The merits of the proposed scheme are verified through

due to excitation of plasma type oscillations in atom under its collisions with
plasma electrons and have a universal statistical representation for all sorts

solution of Miles (1957) for small but finite growth rate, but they are not
consistent physically or mathematically with his analysis in the limit of
growth rate tending to zero. As this and other studies conclude, in the limit
of zero growth rate the effect of the elevated critical layer is eliminated by
finite turbulent diffusivity, so that the perturbed flow and the drag force are
determined by the asymmetric or sheltering flow in the surface shear layer and
its matched interaction with the upper region. But for groups of waves, in
which the individual waves grow and decay, there is a net contribution of the
elevated critical layer to the wave growth. Critical layers, whether elevated
or immersed, affect this asymmetric sheltering mechanism, but in quite a
different way to their effect on growing waves. These asymptotic multi-layer
methods lead to physical insight and suggest approximate methods for analyzing
higher amplitude and more complex flows, such as flow over wave groups.

gravitational wave detectors through the 1970's and '80's, it was debated
whether quantum fluctuations of the light field used for detection, also known
as photon shot noise, would ultimately produce a force noise which would
disturb the detector and limit the sensitivity. Carlton Caves famously answered
this question with ""They do."" With this understanding came ideas how to avoid
this limitation by giving up complete knowledge of the detector's motion. In
these back-action evading (BAE) or quantum non-demolition (QND) schemes, one
manipulates the required quantum measurement back-action by placing it into a
component of the motion which is unobserved and dynamically isolated. Using a
superconducting, electro-mechanical device, we realize a sensitive measurement
of a single motional quadrature with imprecision below the zero-point
fluctuations of motion, detect both the classical and quantum measurement
back-action, and demonstrate BAE avoiding the quantum back-action from the
microwave photons by 9 dB. Further improvements of these techniques are
expected to provide a practical route to manipulate and prepare a squeezed
state of motion with mechanical fluctuations below the quantum zero-point
level, which is of interest both fundamentally and for the detection of very
weak forces.

molecular orbital to the tip, holes are left behind. These can be repopulated

shows that the repopulation process can be efficiently stimulated by the gap
modes near field, TERS scattering from neighboring molecules acting as an
optical seed. Our results demonstrate how optical enhancement inside the
plasmonic cavity can be further increased by a stronger localization via
tunneling through molecules. We anticipate that stimulated emission from an STM

compared with the selected E866 experimental data with the $c\overline{c}$

$J/\psi$ suppression on $R_{W/Be}(x_{F})$ from the initial state nuclear
effects is more important than that induced by the energy loss of color octet
$c\overline{c}$ in the large $x_F$ region. Whether the $c\overline{c}$ pair
energy loss is linear or quadratic with the path length is not determined. The
obtained $c\overline{c}$ pair energy loss per unit path length
$\alpha=2.78\pm0.81$ GeV/fm, which indicates that the heavy quark in cold

quadratic correction of $\alpha T^2$ ($\alpha$ is a model parameter) and the
cosmological constant $\Lambda$. Using a spherical solution describing the
Sun's gravitational field, the resulting secular evolution of planetary orbital
motions, light deflection, gravitational time delay and frequency shift are
calculated up to the leading contribution. Among them, we find qualitatively
that the light deflection holds a unique bound on $\alpha$, without dependence
on $\Lambda$, and the time delay experiments during inferior conjunction impose
a clean constraint on $\Lambda$, regardless of $\alpha$. Based on observation

investigate problems of strategic interaction in multiagent systems. Although
they have been widely studied, almost all previous work on Nash equilibria in
Boolean games has focused on the restricted setting of pure strategies. This is
a shortcoming as finite games are guaranteed to have at least one equilibrium
in mixed strategies, but many simple games fail to have pure strategy
equilibria at all. We address this by showing that a natural decision problem
about mixed equilibria: determining whether a Boolean game has a mixed strategy
equilibrium that guarantees every player a given payoff, is NEXP-hard.
Accordingly, the $\epsilon$ variety of the problem is NEXP-complete. The proof
can be adapted to show coNEXP-hardness of a similar question: whether all Nash
equilibria of a Boolean game guarantee every player at least the given payoff.

cluster A2163 at $z=0.2$. To study the physics of gas heating in cluster
mergers, we investigated hard X-ray emission from the merging cluster A2163,
which hosts the brightest synchrotron radio halo. We analyzed hard X-ray
spectra accumulated from two-pointed Suzaku observations. Non-thermal hard
X-ray emission should result from the inverse Compton (IC) scattering of
relativistic electrons by the CMB photons. To measure this emission, the
dominant thermal emission in the hard X-ray band must be modeled in detail. To
this end, we analyzed the combined broad-band X-ray data of A2163 collected by
Suzaku and XMM-Newton, assuming single- and multi-temperature models for
thermal emission and the power-law model for non-thermal emission. From the
Suzaku data, we detected significant hard X-ray emission from A2163 in the
12-60 keV band at the $28\sigma$ level (or at the $5.5\sigma$ level if a
systematic error is considered). The Suzaku HXD spectrum alone is consistent
with the single-T thermal model of gas temperature $kT=14$ keV. From the XMM
data, we constructed a multi-T model including a very hot ($kT=18$ keV)
component in the NE region. Incorporating the multi-T and the power-law models
into a two-component model with a radio-band photon index, the 12-60 keV energy
flux of non-thermal emission is constrained within $5.3 \pm 0.9 (\pm 3.8)\times
10^{-12}~{\rm erg\, s^{-1} cm^{-2}}$. The 90% upper limit of detected IC
emission is marginal ($< 1.2\times 10^{-11}~{\rm erg\, s^{-1} cm^{-2}}$ in the
12-60 keV). The estimated magnetic field in A2163 is $B > 0.098~{\rm \mu G}$.
While the present results represent a three-fold increase in the accuracy of
the broad band spectral model of A2163, more sensitive hard X-ray observations
are needed to decisively test for the presence of hard X-ray emission due to IC
emission.

among the researchers. However, research is still needed to provide appropriate
solutions to ensure the resistance of the system against error factors. The
present study has tried to apply a mask to the image so that the unexpected
factors affecting the location of the iris can be removed. So, pupil
localization will be faster and robust. Then to locate the exact location of
the iris, a simple stage of boundary displacement due to the Canny edge
detector has been applied. Then, with searching left and right IRIS edge point,
outer radios of IRIS will be detect. Through the process of extracting the iris
features, it has been sought to obtain the distinctive iris texture features by
using a discrete stationary wavelets transform 2-D (DSWT2). Using DSWT2 tool
and symlet 4 wavelet, distinctive features are extracted. To reduce the
computational cost, the features obtained from the application of the wavelet
have been investigated and a feature selection procedure, using similarity
criteria, has been implemented. Finally, the iris matching has been performed
using a semi-correlation criterion. The accuracy of the proposed method for
localization on CASIA-v1, CASIA-v3 is 99.73%, 98.24% and 97.04%, respectively.
The accuracy of the feature extraction proposed method for CASIA3 iris images
database is 97.82%, which confirms the efficiency of the proposed method.

  Methods","To appear in International Conference on Database Theory (ICDT) 2014",,,,"cs.DB cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Query evaluation in tuple-independent probabilistic databases is the problem
of computing the probability of an answer to a query given independent
probabilities of the individual tuples in a database instance. There are two
main approaches to this problem: (1) in `grounded inference' one first obtains
the lineage for the query and database instance as a Boolean formula, then
performs weighted model counting on the lineage (i.e., computes the probability
of the lineage given probabilities of its independent Boolean variables); (2)
in methods known as `lifted inference' or `extensional query evaluation', one
exploits the high-level structure of the query as a first-order formula.
Although it is widely believed that lifted inference is strictly more powerful
than grounded inference on the lineage alone, no formal separation has
previously been shown for query evaluation. In this paper we show such a formal
separation for the first time.
  We exhibit a class of queries for which model counting can be done in
polynomial time using extensional query evaluation, whereas the algorithms used
in state-of-the-art exact model counters on their lineages provably require
exponential time. Our lower bounds on the running times of these exact model
counters follow from new exponential size lower bounds on the kinds of d-DNNF
representations of the lineages that these model counters (either explicitly or
implicitly) produce. Though some of these queries have been studied before, no
non-trivial lower bounds on the sizes of these representations for these
queries were previously known.

various conflicted objectives simultaneously attracted an incremental interest

modal, non convex and multi criterion. Hence, many researchers utilized
versatile intelligent models such as Pareto based techniques, game theory
(cooperative and non cooperative games), neuro evolutionary systems, fuzzy
logic and advanced neural networks for handling these types of problems. In
this paper a novel method called Synchronous Self Learning Pareto Strategy
Algorithm (SSLPSA) is presented which utilizes Evolutionary Computing (EC),
Swarm Intelligence (SI) techniques and adaptive Classical Self Organizing Map
(CSOM) simultaneously incorporating with a data shuffling behavior.
Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) which attempt to simulate the phenomenon of
natural evolution are powerful numerical optimization algorithms that reach an
approximate global maximum of a complex multi variable function over a wide
search space and swarm base technique can improved the intensity and the
robustness in EA. CSOM is a neural network capable of learning and can improve
the quality of obtained optimal Pareto front. To prove the efficient
performance of proposed algorithm, authors utilized some well known benchmark

However, this localization mechanism does not work anymore for Randall-Sundrum

localized on the brane and there is a mass gap between the fermion zero mode

a regular coarse-grained free energy landscape (FEL) as function of the number

landscape structure is predicted, where forward and backward energy barriers
between partly unfolded states are decreasing linearly with force. Stochastic
unfolding trajectories for such molecules with simple FEL are subsequently
generated by kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. Introducing probabilities that

resources for services, the resources are typically short lived compared with
the lives of the organisms that produce and make use of them. This fact allows
a separation of time scales, by which the numerical response of one species
with respect to the abundance of another can be derived mechanistically. These
responses can account for intra-specific competition, due to the partition of
the resources provided by mutualists, in this way connecting competition theory
and mutualism at a microscopic level. It is also possible to derive saturating
responses in the case of species that provide resources but expect a service in
return (e.g. pollination, seed dispersal) instead of food or nutrients. In both
situations, competition and saturation have the same underlying cause, which is
that the generation of resources occur at a finite velocity per individual of
the providing species, but their depletion happens much faster due to the
acceleration in growth rates that characterizes mutualism. The resulting models
can display all the basic features seen in many models of facultative and
obligate mutualisms, and they can be generalized from species pairs to larger
communities. The parameters of the numerical responses can be related with
quantities that can be in principle measured, and that can be related by
trade-offs, which can be useful for studying the evolution of mutualisms.

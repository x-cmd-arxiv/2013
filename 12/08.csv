fields based on ultraviolet (UV) polarization of starlight, which is in part
produced by weakly aligned, small interstellar grains. We begin with
calculating degrees of alignment of small (size $a\sim 0.01\mu$m) and very
small ($a\sim 0.001\mu$m) grains in the interstellar magnetic field due to the
Davis-Greenstein paramagnetic relaxation and resonance paramagnetic relaxation.
We compute the degrees of paramagnetic alignment with the ambient magnetic
field $B$ using Langevin equations. In this paper, we take into account various
processes essential for the dynamics of small grains, including infrared (IR)
emission, electric dipole emission, plasma drag and collisions with neutral and
ionized species. We find that the alignment of small grains is necessary to
reproduce the observed polarization in the UV, although the polarization
arising from these small grains is negligible at the optical and IR
wavelengths. Based on fitting theoretical models to observed extinction and
polarization curves, we find that the best-fit model requires a higher degree
of alignment of small grains for the case with the peak wavelength of
polarization $\lambda_{\max}<0.55\mu$m, which exhibits an excess UV
polarization relative to the Serkowski law, compared to the typical case
$\lambda_{\max}=0.55\mu$m. We interpret the correlation between the systematic
increase of the UV polarization relative to maximum polarization (i.e. of
$p(6\mu m^{-1})/p_{\max}$) with $\lambda_{\max}^{-1}$ by appealing to the
higher degree of alignment of small grains. We identify paramagnetic relaxation
as the cause of the alignment of small grains and utilize the dependence of the
degree of alignment on the magnetic field strength $B$ to suggest a new way to
measure $B$ using the observable parameters $\lambda_{\max}$ and $p(6\mu
m^{-1})/p_{\max}$.[Abridged]

the realization of SC in the parent compound BaFe2As2 (no bulk Tc) just by
tensile lattice strain without charge doping. We investigate the interplay
between strain and SC in epitaxial BaFe2As2 thin films on Fe-buffered MgAl2O4
single crystalline substrates. The strong interfacial bonding between Fe and
the FeAs sublattice increases the Fe-Fe distance due to the lattice misfit

induces SC with bulk-Tc ?10K. These results highlight the role of structural
changes in controlling the phase diagram of Fe-based superconductors.

(Maxwellian) distribution to describe quasi-steady-state plasma in solar
atmosphere including active regions. In particular, other distributions have
been proposed to better fit observations, for example, kappa- and
$n$-distributions. If present, these distributions will generate radio
emissions with different observable properties compared with the classical
gyroresonance (GR) or free-free emission, which implies a way of remote
detecting these non-Maxwellian distributions in the radio observations. Here we
present analytically derived GR and free-free emissivities and absorption
coefficients for the kappa- and $n$-distributions and discuss their properties,
which are in fact remarkably different from each other and from the classical
Maxwellian plasma. In particular, the radio brightness temperature from a
gyrolayer increases with the optical depth $\tau$ for kappa-distribution, but
decreases with $\tau$ for $n$-distribution. This property has a remarkable
consequence allowing a straightforward observational test: the gyroresonance
radio emission from the non-Maxwellian distributions is supposed to be
noticeably polarized even in the optically thick case, where the emission would
have strictly zero polarization in the case of Maxwellian plasma. This offers a
way of remote probing the plasma distribution in astrophysical sources

first one follows the observation that the classical definition of derivatives
involves prospective (or forward) difference quotients, not known whenever the
time is directed, at least at the macroscopic level. Actually, the available
and known derivatives are retrospective (or backward). They co\""incide whenever
the functions are differentiable in the classical sense, but not in the case of
non smooth maps, single-valued or set-valued. The later ones are used in
differential inclusions (and thus, in uncertain control systems) governing
evolutions in function of time and state. We follow the plea of some physicists
for taking also into account the retrospective derivatives to study prospective
evolutions in function of time, state and retrospective derivatives, a
particular, but specific, example of historical of ''path dependent''
evolutionary systems. This is even more crucial in life sciences, in the
absence of experimentation of uncertain evolutionary systems. The second
motivation emerged from the study of networks with junctions (cross-roads in
traffic networks, synapses in neural networks, banks in financial networks,
etc.), an important feature of ''complex systems''. At each junction, the
velocities of the incoming (retrospective) and outgoing (prospective)
evolutions are confronted. One measure of this confrontation (''jerkiness'') is
provided by the product of the retrospective and prospective velocities,
negative in ''inhibitory'' junctions, positive for ''excitatory'' ones, for
instance. This leads to the introduction of the ''differential connection
tensor'' of two evolutions, defined as the tensor product of retrospective and
prospective derivatives, which can be used for controlling evolutionary systems
governing the evolutions through networks with junctions.

network. They single out a subset of ''traffic states'' described by time,
duration, position and other traffic attributes (called ''monads'' for short).
Duration evolutions are non-negative, decreasing toward zero for incoming
durations, increasing from zero for outgoing durations, allowing the detection
of ''junction states'' defined as traffic states with ''zero duration''. A
''junction relation'' (crossroads, synapses, clearing houses, etc.) Is a subset
of the transport relation made of junction states? The objective is to
construct a ''transport regulator'' associating with traffic states a set of
''celerities'' that mobiles circulating in the network can use as velocities.
In other word, a network is regarded as a ''provider of velocity information''
to the mobiles for travelling from one departure state to an arrival state
across a junction relation (a kind of geodesic problem). This investigation
assumes that a system governs the evolution of monads in function of time,
duration and position using celerities as controls and provides the transport
regulator, a feedback from transport states to celerities. The proposed
mathematical framework can acclimate road or aerial networks, endocrine
(hormonal) or synaptic (neurotransmitters) networks, financial or economic
networks, which motivated this investigation. This framework could probably
accommodate computer and even social networks. This investigation is restricted

storage codes that min- imize the total communication cost required to repair a
single coded symbol after an erasure, referred to as repair bandwidth (BW).
Vector codes allow communicating fewer sub-symbols per node, instead of the
entire content. This allows non trivial savings in repair BW. In sharp
contrast, classic codes, like Reed- Solomon (RS), used in current storage
systems, are deemed to suffer from naive repair, i.e. downloading the entire
stored message to repair one failed node. This mainly happens because they are
scalar-linear. In this work, we present a simple framework that treats scalar
codes as vector-linear. In some cases, this allows significant savings in
repair BW. We show that vectorized scalar codes exhibit properties that
simplify the design of repair schemes. Our framework can be seen as a finite
field analogue of real interference alignment. Using our simplified framework,
we design a scheme that we call clique-repair which provably identifies the
best linear repair strategy for any scalar 2-parity MDS code, under some
conditions on the sub-field chosen for vectorization. We specify optimal repair
schemes for specific (5,3)- and (6,4)-Reed- Solomon (RS) codes. Further, we
present a repair strategy for the RS code currently deployed in the Facebook

how hard it is to update the solution to a problem when the input is changed
slightly. It considers the changes required to some stored data structure
(possibly a massive database) as small quantities of data (or a tuple) are
inserted or deleted from the database (or a structure over some vocabulary).
The main difference from previous notions of dynamic complexity is that instead
of treating the update quantitatively by finding the the time/space trade-offs,
it tries to consider the update qualitatively, by finding the complexity class
in which the update can be expressed (or made). In this setting, DynFO, or
Dynamic First-Order, is one of the smallest and the most natural complexity
class (since SQL queries can be expressed in First-Order Logic), and contains
those problems whose solutions (or the stored data structure from which the
solution can be found) can be updated in First-Order Logic when the data
structure undergoes small changes.
  Etessami considered the problem of isomorphism in the dynamic setting, and
showed that Tree Isomorphism can be decided in DynFO. In this work, we show
that isomorphism of Planar 3-connected graphs can be decided in DynFO+ (which
is DynFO with some polynomial precomputation). We maintain a canonical
description of 3-connected Planar graphs by maintaining a database which is
accessed and modified by First-Order queries when edges are added to or deleted
from the graph. We specifically exploit the ideas of Breadth-First Search and
Canonical Breadth-First Search to prove the results. We also introduce a novel
method for canonizing a 3-connected planar graph in First-Order Logic from

${\mathsf{C}^{\oplus}_{\min}}[f]$ and ${\mathsf{DT^{\oplus}}}[f]$.
${\mathsf{C}^{\oplus}_{\min}}[f]$ is the \emph{parity kill number} of $f$, the
fewest number of parities on the input variables one has to fix in order to
""kill"" $f$, i.e. to make it constant. ${\mathsf{DT^{\oplus}}}[f]$ is the depth
of the shortest \emph{parity decision tree} which computes $f$. These
complexity measures have in recent years become increasingly important in the
fields of communication complexity \cite{ZS09, MO09, ZS10, TWXZ13} and
pseudorandomness \cite{BK12, Sha11, CT13}.
  Our main result is a composition theorem for ${\mathsf{C}^{\oplus}_{\min}}$.
The $k$-th power of $f$, denoted $f^{\circ k}$, is the function which results
from composing $f$ with itself $k$ times. We prove that if $f$ is not a parity
function, then ${\mathsf{C}^{\oplus}_{\min}}[f^{\circ k}] \geq
\Omega({\mathsf{C}_{\min}}[f]^{k}).$ In other words, the parity kill number of
$f$ is essentially supermultiplicative in the \emph{normal} kill number of $f$
(also known as the minimum certificate complexity).
  As an application of our composition theorem, we show lower bounds on the
parity complexity measures of $\mathsf{Sort}^{\circ k}$ and $\mathsf{HI}^{\circ
k}$. Here $\mathsf{Sort}$ is the sort function due to Ambainis \cite{Amb06},
and $\mathsf{HI}$ is Kushilevitz's hemi-icosahedron function \cite{NW95}. In
doing so, we disprove a conjecture of Montanaro and Osborne \cite{MO09} which
had applications to communication complexity and computational learning theory.
In addition, we give new lower bounds for conjectures of \cite{MO09,ZS10} and

resonant structures with each other in the vicinity of the gas giant as in the
case when the gas giant is absent? When there is no gas giant in the system, it
has been already shown that if the two low-mass planets undergo a convergent
differential migration, they will capture each other in a mean-motion
resonance. For the choices of disc parameters and planet masses made in this

the migration of the super-Earth and, after that, all three planets become

leads to close encounters between planets and eventually to the ejection from

reactions close to the threshold ($p_{\rm lab}=5-7$ GeV/c). The rescattering
and absorption of the incoming antiproton and outgoing charmonium on nucleons
are taken into account, including the possibility of the elastic and
nondiagonal (flavor-conserving) scattering $\chi_{cJ} N \to \chi_{cJ^\prime}
N$, $J,J^\prime=0,1,2$. The elementary amplitudes of the latter processes are
evaluated by expanding the physical $\chi_c$-states in the Clebsch-Gordan
series of the $c \bar c$ states with fixed values of internal orbital angular
momentum ($L_z$) and spin projections on the $\chi_c$ momentum axis. The total
interaction cross sections of these $c \bar c$ states with nucleons have been
calculated in previous works using the QCD factorization theorem and the
nonrelativistic quarkonium model and turned out to be strongly $L_z$-dependent
due to the transverse size difference. This directly leads to finite values of
the $\chi_c$-nucleon nondiagonal scattering amplitudes. We show that the
$\chi_{c0} N \to \chi_{c2} N$ transitions significantly influence the
$\chi_{c2}$-production with helicity zero at small transverse momenta. This can
serve as a signal in future experimental tests of the quark structure of
$\chi_c$-states by the PANDA collaboration at FAIR.

forums, our main focus is in understanding forum activities. Two salient
features of MOOC forum activities drive our research: 1. High decline rate: for
all courses studied, the volume of discussions in the forum declines
continuously throughout the duration of the course. 2. High-volume, noisy
discussions: at least 30% of the courses produce new discussion threads at
rates that are infeasible for students or teaching staff to read through.
Furthermore, a substantial portion of the discussions are not directly
course-related.
  We investigate factors that correlate with the decline of activity in the
online discussion forums and find effective strategies to classify threads and
rank their relevance. Specifically, we use linear regression models to analyze
the time series of the count data for the forum activities and make a number of
observations, e.g., the teaching staff's active participation in the discussion
increases the discussion volume but does not slow down the decline rate. We
then propose a unified generative model for the discussion threads, which
allows us both to choose efficient thread classifiers and design an effective
algorithm for ranking thread relevance. Our ranking algorithm is further
compared against two baseline algorithms, using human evaluation from Amazon

liquid-metal embrittlement of Al due to Ga. Ab initio and molecular mechanics
were employed to probe the binding energies of vacancies and segregation
energies of Ga for <100>, <110> and <111> STGBs in Al. We found that the GB
local arrangements and resulting structural units have a significant influence
on the magnitude of vacancy binding energies. For example, the mean vacancy
binding energy for <100>, <110>, and <111> STGBs at 1st layer was found to be
-0.63 eV, -0.26 eV, and -0.60 eV. However, some GBs exhibited vacancy binding
energies closer to bulk values, indicating interfaces with zero sink strength,
i.e., these GBs may not provide effective pathways for vacancy diffusion. The
results from the present work showed that the GB structure and the associated
free volume also play significant roles in Ga segregation and the subsequent
embrittlement of Al. The Ga mean segregation energy for <100>, <110> and <111>
STGBs at 1st layer was found to be -0.23 eV, -0.12 eV and -0.24 eV,
respectively, suggesting a stronger correlation between the GB structural unit,
its free volume, and segregation behavior. Furthermore, as the GB free volume
increased, the difference in segregation energies between the 1st layer and the
0th layer increased. Thus, the GB character and free volume provide an
important key to understanding the degree of anisotropy in various systems. The
overall characteristic Ga absorption length scale was found to be about ~10, 8,
and 12 layers for <100>, <110>, and <111> STGBs, respectively. Also, a few GBs
of different tilt axes with relatively high segregation energies (between 0 and
-0.1 eV) at the boundary were also found. This finding provides a new atomistic
perspective to the GB engineering of materials with smart GB networks to
mitigate or control LME and more general embrittlement phenomena in alloys.

influential users in a social network, who, when convinced to adopt a product,
shall influence other users in the network and trigger a large cascade of
adoptions. However, the host (the owner of an online social platform) often
faces more constraints than a single product, endless user attentions,
unlimited budget and unbounded time; in reality, multiple products need to be
advertised, each user can tolerate only a small number of recommendations,
influencing user has a cost and advertisers have only limited budgets, and the
adoptions need to be maximized within a short time window.
  Given theses myriads of user, monetary, and timing constraints, it is
extremely challenging for the host to design principled and efficient viral
market algorithms with provable guarantees. In this paper, we provide a novel
solution by formulating the problem as a submodular maximization in a
continuous-time diffusion model under an intersection of a matroid and multiple
knapsack constraints. We also propose an adaptive threshold greedy algorithm
which can be faster than the traditional greedy algorithm with lazy evaluation,
and scalable to networks with million of nodes. Furthermore, our mathematical
formulation allows us to prove that the algorithm can achieve an approximation
factor of $k_a/(2+2 k)$ when $k_a$ out of the $k$ knapsack constraints are
active, which also improves over previous guarantees from combinatorial
optimization literature. In the case when influencing each user has uniform
cost, the approximation becomes even better to a factor of $1/3$. Extensive
synthetic and real world experiments demonstrate that our budgeted influence
maximization algorithm achieves the-state-of-the-art in terms of both
effectiveness and scalability, often beating the next best by significant
margins.

infrastructure cooperation. We analyze its spectral efficiency and outage
performance and show that compared to existing frequency-division schemes, the
proposed scheme achieves the same or better spectral efficiency and outage
performance while having simpler signaling and shorter decoding delay. Using
time-division, the proposed scheme divides each transmission frame into three
phases with variable durations. The two user equipments (UEs) partially
exchange their information in the first two phases, then cooperatively transmit
to the base station (BS) in the third phase. We further formulate its common
and individual outage probabilities, taking into account outages at both UEs
and the BS. We analyze this outage performance in Rayleigh fading environment
assuming full channel state information (CSI) at the receivers and limited CSI
at the transmitters. Results show that comparing to non-cooperative
transmission, the proposed cooperation always improves the instantaneous
achievable rate region even under half-duplex transmission. Moreover, as the
received signal-to-noise ratio increases, this uplink cooperation significantly
reduces overall outage probabilities and achieves the full diversity order in
spite of additional outages at the UEs. These characteristics of the proposed

established by a set of mobile nodes on a shared wireless channel. One of the
major issues in MANET is routing due to the mobility of the nodes. Routing
means the act of moving information across an internet work from a source to a

characteristics like dynamic topology, time varying QoS requirements, limited
resources and energy etc. QoS routing plays an important role for providing QoS
in wireless ad hoc networks. The most complex issue in this kind of networks is
to find a path between the communication end points satisfying QoS requirement
for the user. Nature-inspired algorithms (swarm intelligence) such as ant
colony optimization ACO)algorithms have shown to be a good technique for
developing routing algorithms for MANETs.
  In this paper, a new QoS algorithm for mobile ad hoc network has been
proposed. The proposed algorithm combines the idea of Ant Colony Optimization

small quantum correlations between successive steps and verify the previous
result. Then we generalize the concept of correction to Hawking state by
relaxing the `smallness' condition. Our result generates a nontrivial upper and
lower bound on change in entanglement entropy in the evaporation process. This
gives us a quantitative measure of correction that would mathematically
facilitate restoration of unitarity in black hole evaporation. We then
investigate whether this result is compatible to the established physical
constraints of unitary evolution of a state in a subsystem. We find that the
generalized bound on entanglement entropy leads to significant deviation from
Page curve. This leads us to agree with the recent claim in literature that no
amount of correction in the form of Bell pair states would lead to any
resolution to the information paradox.

that undergoes an expansion followed by a contraction, quite different to his
static model of 1917 or the monotonic Einstein-de Sitter model of 1932. The
paper offers many insights into the cosmology of Albert Einstein in the light
of the first evidence for an expanding universe, and we discuss his views of
issues such as the curvature of space, the cosmological constant, the
singularity and the timespan of the expansion. We argue that retrospective
descriptions of this model as cyclic or periodic are not historically or
mathematically accurate. We find that calculations in the paper of the matter
density and radius of the universe contain a numerical error, a finding that is
supported by writing on a blackboard used by Einstein during a lecture at
Oxford University in May 1931. Our article concludes with a general discussion
of his philosophy of cosmology.

to grow further to offset the limitations of memory bandwidth and speed. Due to
high leakage consumption of SRAM device, caches designed with SRAM consume
large amount of energy. To address this, use of emerging technologies such as
spin torque transfer RAM (STT-RAM) has been investigated which have lower
leakage power dissipation. However, the high write latency and power of it may
lead to large energy consumption which present challenges in its use. In this
report, we propose a cache reconfiguration based technique for improving the
energy efficiency of STT-RAM based LLCs. Our technique dynamically adjusts the
active cache size to reduce the cache leakage energy consumption with minimum
performance loss. We choose a suitable value of STT-RAM retention time for
avoiding refresh overhead and gaining performance. Single-core simulations have
been performed using SPEC2006 benchmarks and Sniper x86-64 simulator. The
results show that while, compared to an STT-RAM LLC of similar area, an SRAM
LLC incurs nearly 100% loss in energy and 7.3% loss in performance; our
technique using STT-RAM cache saves 21.8% energy and incurs only 1.7% loss in
performance.

the variance of the index scales for large $N$ as $\mathrm{Var}(N_+)\sim

1.4 and 1.8 when disks have developed a cool stellar component, rotation
dominates over turbulent motions in the gas, and massive clumps become less
frequent. During the transition from clumpy to spiral disks, two unusual types
of spirals are found in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field that are massive, clumpy
and irregular like their predecessor clumpy disks, yet spiral-like or sheared
like their descendants. One type is ``woolly'' with massive clumpy arms all
over the disk and is brighter than other disk galaxies at the same redshift,
while another type has irregular multiple arms with high pitch angles, star
formation knots and no inner symmetry like today's multiple-arm galaxies. The
common types of spirals seen locally are also present in a redshift range
around z~1, namely grand design with two symmetric arms, multiple arm with
symmetry in the inner parts and several long, thin arms in the outer parts, and
flocculent, with short, irregular and patchy arms that are mostly from star
formation. Normal multiple arm galaxies are found only closer than z~0.6 in the
UDF. Grand design galaxies extend furthest to z~1.8, presumably because
interactions can drive a two-arm spiral in a disk that would otherwise have a
more irregular structure. The difference between these types is understandable
in terms of the usual stability parameters for gas and stars, and the ratio of
the velocity dispersion to rotation speed.

teachers, and all professionals interested in functional programming in
education. Submissions were vetted by the TFPIE 2013 program committee using
prevailing academic standards. The 2 articles in this volume were selected for
publication as the result of this process. Tobin-Hochstadt and Van Horn report
on their solution to the difficult transition between the first semester course
in functional programming (using languages, programming environment, etc.
intended for teaching) to the second semester course in object-oriented
programming (with a production-oriented language, environment, etc.). Finding
that this confusing circumstance made the key concepts hard to grasp for
students, the authors present and evaluate a new introduction to the second
semester course, based on the environment and languages the students used
before, that focusses on key object-oriented concepts. Caldwell lays out an
education narrative that focusses on reasoning about programs, using structural
induction principles. He argues that more such formal reasoning should get more
emphasis in programming education and demonstrates the feasibility thereof by
reporting on his experiences using this narrative in the functional programming
course at the University of Wyoming.

fundamental cellular processes including the maintenance of cell shape,
organelle transport and formation of the mitotic spindle. Microtubule dynamic
instability is critical for these processes, but it remains poorly understood,
in part because the relationship between the structure of the MT tip and the
growth/depolymerization transitions is enigmatic. What are the functionally
significant aspects of a tip structure that is capable of promoting MT growth,
and how do changes in these characteristics cause the transition to
depolymerization (catastrophe)? Here we use computational models to investigate
the connection between cracks (laterally unbonded regions) between
protofilaments and dynamic instability. Our work indicates that it is not the
depth of the cracks per se that governs MT dynamic instability. Instead it is
whether the cracks terminate in GTP-rich or GDP-rich areas of the MT that
governs whether a particular MT tip structure is likely to grow, shrink, or
transition: the identity of the crack-terminating subunit pairs has a profound
influence on the moment-by-moment behavior of the MT.

extend the concept of W-entropy for gravitational fields in the general

flow theory of three dimensional, 3-d, Riemannian metrics by G. Perelman,
arXiv: math.DG/0211159. Nonrelativistic 3-d Ricci flows are characterized by
associated statistical thermodynamical values determined by W--entropy.
Generalizations for geometric flows of 4-d pseudo-Riemannian metrics are
considered for models with local thermodynamical equilibrium and separation of
dissipative and non-dissipative processes in relativistic hydrodynamics. The
approach is elaborated in the framework of classical filed theories
(relativistic continuum and hydrodynamic models) without an underlying kinetic
description which will be elaborated in other works. The 3+1 splitting allows
us to provide a general relativistic definition of gravitational entropy in the
Lyapunov-Perelman sense. It increases monotonically as structure forms in the
Universe. We can formulate a thermodynamic description of exact solutions in GR
depending, in general, on all spacetime coordinates. A corresponding 2+2
splitting with nonholonomic deformation of linear connection and frame
structures is necessary for generating in very general form various classes of
exact solutions of the Einstein and general relativistic geometric flow
equations. Finally, we speculate on physical macrostates and microstate
interpretations of the W-entropy in GR, geometric flow theories and possible
connections to string theory (a second unsolved problem also contained in
Perelman's works) in the Polyakov's approach.

  construction and comparison of genome-enabled selection models",,,"10.1534/genetics.114.169490",,"q-bio.QM stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The additive genetic effect is arguably the most important quantity inferred
in animal and plant breeding analyses. The term effect indicates that it
represents causal information, which is different from standard statistical
concepts as regression coefficient and association. The process of inferring
causal information is also different from standard statistical learning, as the
former requires causal (i.e. non-statistical) assumptions and involves extra
complexities. Remarkably, the task of inferring genetic effects is largely seen
as a standard regression/prediction problem, contradicting its label. This
widely accepted analysis approach is by itself insufficient for causal
learning, suggesting that causality is not the point for selection. Given this
incongruence, it is important to verify if genomic predictors need to represent
causal effects to be relevant for selection decisions, especially because
applying regression studies to answer causal questions may lead to wrong
conclusions. The answer to this question defines if genomic selection models
should be constructed aiming maximum genomic predictive ability or aiming
identifiability of genetic causal effects. Here, we demonstrate that selection
relies on a causal effect from genotype to phenotype, and that genomic
predictors are only useful for selection if they distinguish such effect from
other sources of association. Conversely, genomic predictors capturing
non-causal signals provide information that is less relevant for selection
regardless of the resulting predictive ability. Focusing on covariate choice
decision, simulated examples are used to show that predictive ability, which is
the criterion normally used to compare models, may not indicate the quality of
genomic predictors for selection. Additionally, we propose using alternative
criteria to construct models aiming for the identification of the genetic
causal effects.

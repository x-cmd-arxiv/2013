learners in which each learner possesses a convex cost function, a set of
affine equality constraints, and a set of convex inequality constraints. We
propose a fully-distributed adaptive diffusion algorithm based on penalty
methods that allows the network to cooperatively optimize the global cost
function, which is defined as the sum of the individual costs over the network,
subject to all constraints. We show that when small constant step-sizes are
employed, the expected distance between the optimal solution vector and that
obtained at each node in the network can be made arbitrarily small. Two
distinguishing features of the proposed solution relative to other related
approaches is that the developed strategy does not require the use of
projections and is able to adapt to and track drifts in the location of the
minimizer due to changes in the constraints or in the aggregate cost itself.
The proposed strategy is also able to cope with changing network topology, is
robust to network disruptions, and does not require global information or rely
on central processors.

grafted chains, $N_{\rm ch}$, and the symmetry of the self-assembled bulk

intervals for a rod-like, disc-like and spherulitic conformations in terms of
$N_{\rm ch}$. These are followed by coarse-grained molecular dynamics
simulations for both spontaneous and aided self-assembly of LC macromolecules
into bulk phases. In spontaneous self-assembly runs, essential coexistence of
rod-like and disc-like conformations is observed (via analysis of the
histograms for the molecular asphericity) in a broad interval of $N_{\rm ch}$,
which prevents the formation of defect-free structures. The use of uniaxial and
planar aiding fields is found to improve self-assembly into monodomain phases
by promoting conformations of respective symmetry. Strong shape-phase relation,
observed experimentally, is also indicated by the simulations by the
coincidence of the stability intervals for the respective conformations with

star formation, which suggests that quenching is the primary process in the
transition from the star-forming to the quiescent state. To model the
environmental quenching scenario, we have tested the use of different
exponential quenching timescales and delays between satellite accretion and the
onset of quenching. We find that with no delay, the quenching timescale needs
to be long in order to match the observed quiescent fraction, but then this
model produces too many intermediate galaxies. Fixing a delay time of 3 Gyr, as
suggested from the local universe, produces too few quiescent galaxies. The
observed fractions are best matched with a model that includes a delay that is
proportional to the dynamical time and a rapid quenching timescale ($\sim0.25$
Gyr), but this model also predicts intermediate galaxies H{\delta} strength
higher than that observed. Using stellar synthesis models, we have tested other
scenarios, such as the rejuvenation of star formation in early-type galaxies

environment quenching plays a role in the GEEC2 sample, then our work suggests
that only a fraction of intermediate galaxies may be undergoing this transition

different top electrode widths we test and compare these three theories. It was
found that, contrary to model 2's prediction, the `dimensionless lumped

Contrary to model 1, memristance was found to be dependent on the three spatial
dimensions of the TiO$_2$ layer, as was predicted by model 3. Model 3 was found
to fit the change in resistance value with electrode size. Simulations using
model 3 and experimentally derived values for contact resistance gave
hysteresis values that were linearly related to (and only one order of
magnitude out) from the experimentally-measured values. Memristor hysteresis
was found to be related to the ON state resistance and thus the electrode size
(as those two are related). These results offer a verification of the
memory-conservation theory of memristance and its association of the vacancy
magnetic flux with the missing magnetic flux in memristor theory. This is the
first paper to experimentally test various theories pertaining to the operation

compressed sensing problems. These two ideas are independent of each other and
can therefore be used either separately or together. We consider all
possibilities.
  For the first approach, we note that the zero vector can be taken as the
initial basic (infeasible) solution for the linear programming problem and
therefore, if the true signal is very sparse, some variants of the simplex
method can be expected to take only a small number of pivots to arrive at a
solution. We implemented one such variant and demonstrate a dramatic
improvement in computation time on very sparse signals.
  The second approach requires a redesigned sensing mechanism in which the
vector signal is stacked into a matrix. This allows us to exploit the Kronecker
compressed sensing (KCS) mechanism. We show that the Kronecker sensing requires
stronger conditions for perfect recovery compared to the original vector
problem. However, the Kronecker sensing, modeled correctly, is a much sparser
linear optimization problem. Hence, algorithms that benefit from sparse problem
representation, such as interior-point methods, can solve the Kronecker sensing
problems much faster than the corresponding vector problem. In our numerical
studies, we demonstrate a ten-fold improvement in the computation time.

to hundreds of objects and maximum likelihood estimators may present biases for
such sample sizes. In this work we use the Monte Carlo approach to determine
the presence of bias on cosmological parameter estimators from cluster
abundance as a function of the area and depth of the survey, and the number of
cosmological parameters fitted. Assuming perfect knowledge of mass and redshift
some estimators have non-negligible biases. For example, the bias of $\sigma_8$
corresponds to about $40%$ of its statistical error bar when fitted together
with $\Omega_c$ and $w_0$. Including a SZ mass-observable relation decreases
the relevance of the bias, for the typical sizes of current surveys. The biases
become negligible when combining the SZ data with other cosmological probes.
However, we show that the biases from SZ estimators do not go away with
increasing sample sizes and they may become the dominant source of error for an
all sky survey at the South Pole Telescope (SPT) sensitivity. The results of
this work validate the use of the current maximum likelihood methods for

flux rope to model coronal mass ejections. The model magnetic field is
two-dimensional, force-free and has current only on the axis of the flux rope
and within two currents sheets. It is a generalization of previous models
containing a single current sheet anchored to a bipolar flux distribution. Our
new model can undergo quasi-static evolution due either to changes at the
boundary or to magnetic reconnection at either current sheet. We find that all
three kinds of evolution can lead to a catastrophe known as loss of
equilibrium. Some equilibria can be driven to catastrophic instability either
through reconnection at the lower current sheet, known as tether cutting, or
through reconnection at the upper current sheet, known as breakout. Other
equilibria can be destabilized through only one and not the other. Still others
undergo no instability, but evolve increasingly rapidly in response to slow
steady driving (ideal or reconnective). One key feature of every case is a
response to reconnection different from that found in simpler systems. In our
two-current sheet model a reconnection electric field in one current sheet
causes the current in that sheet to {\em increase} rather than decrease. This
suggests the possibility for the microscopic reconnection mechanism to run
away.

  Towards the proof of this correspondence, we analyze arbitrary spin pattern

conformal covariance at the first (non-trivial) order. We formulate these

one-point functions of any local spin correlations.

translate any spin pattern probability (and hence any lattice local field
correlation) in terms of discrete complex analysis quantities. The proof
requires working with multipoint lattice spinors with monodromy (including

i.e. commercially profitable material, and not merely a high concentration of a
resource. I apply this formalism to two resource cases: platinum group metals
(PGMs) and water. Assuming for now that only Ni-Fe asteroids are of interest
for PGMs, then 1% of NEOs are rich in PGMs. The dearth of ultra-low delta-v
(<4.5 km s-1) NEOs larger than 100 m diameter reduces the ore-bearing fraction
to only ~1 in 2000 NEOs. As 100 m diameter NEOs are needed to have a value >=
US$1 B and the population of near-Earth objects (NEOs) larger than 100 m
diameter is ~20,000 (Mainzer et al. 2011) the total population of PGM
ore-bearing NEOs is roughly 10. I stress that this is a conservative and highly
uncertain value. For example, an order of magnitude increase in PGM ore-bearing
NEOs occurs if delta-v can as large as 5.7 km s-1. Water ore for utilization in
space is likely to be found in ~1/1100 NEOs. NEOs as small as 18 m diameter can
be water-ore-bodies because of the high richness of water (~20%) expected in
~25% of carbonaceous asteroids, bringing the number of water-ore-bearing NEOs
to ~9000 out of the 10 million NEOs of this size. These small NEOs are,
however, hard to find with present surveys. There will be ~18 water-ore-bearing
NEOs >100 m diameter. These estimates are at present highly imprecise and
sensitive to small changes, especially in the maximum delta-v allowed.
Nonetheless the low values found here mean that much improved determinations of

techniques are inadequate to identify such asteroids confidently. Finding an
asteroid that can be profitably mined requires proximate observations from
assay probes. Here we use a simple statistical approach to estimate the number
of assay probes, Nassay, needed to find at least one ore-bearing asteroid at a
high confidence (90%, 95%, 99%). We present results for a wide range of values
of the probability of an asteroid being rich in the resource of interest,
Prich. We find that Nassay depends strongly on Prich, for likely values of
Prich (<0.5). For a plausible value of Prich~0.1 then to obtain 90% confidence
that at least one ore-bearing asteroid is found, Nassay = 22, and for 99%
confidence Nassay = 44. A factor two increase in Prich roughly halves Nassay,
while even for Prich~0.5, Nassay (90%) = 4. Hence any improvement in asteroid
characterization prior to sending probes to its proximity would be an effective
way to cost-effectively search for valuable resources among the asteroids. Some
possibilities for doing so are briefly discussed.

scale structure around the observer. To this purpose we develop a new inversion
method to map luminosity distance to a LTB metric based on the use of the exact
analytical solution for Einstein equations. The main advantages of this
approach are an improved numerical accuracy and stability, an exact analytical
setting of the initial conditions for the differential equations which need to
be solved and the validity for any sign of the functions determining the LTB
geometry. Given the fully analytical form of the differential equations, this
method also simplifies the calculation of the red-shift expansion around the
apparent horizon point where the numerical solution becomes unstable. We test
the method by inverting the supernovae Ia luminosity distance function
corresponding to the the best fit $\Lambda CDM$ model. We find that only a
limited range of initial conditions is compatible with observations, or a
transition from red to blue shift can occur at relatively low redshift. Despite
LTB solutions without a cosmological constant have been shown not to be
compatible with all different set of available observational data, those
studies normally fit data assuming a special functional ansatz for the
inhomogeneity profile, which often depend only on few parameters. Inversion
methods on the contrary are able to fully explore the freedom in fixing the
functions which determine a LTB solution. Another important possible
application is not about LTB solutions as cosmological models, but rather as
tools to study the effects on the observations made by a generic observer
located in an inhomogeneous region of the Universe where a fully non
perturbative treatment involving exact solutions of Einstein equations is
required.

This paper expands on the idea of conditional computation introduced by Bengio,
et. al., where the nodes of a deep network are augmented by a set of gating
units that determine when a node should be calculated. By factorizing the
weight matrix into a low-rank approximation, an estimation of the sign of the
pre-nonlinearity activation can be efficiently obtained. For networks using
rectified-linear hidden units, this implies that the computation of a hidden
unit with an estimated negative pre-nonlinearity can be ommitted altogether, as
its value will become zero when nonlinearity is applied. For sparse neural
networks, this can result in considerable speed gains. Experimental results
using the MNIST and SVHN data sets with a fully-connected deep neural network
demonstrate the performance robustness of the proposed scheme with respect to
the error introduced by the conditional computation process.

columns is presented. Despite their apparent instability, classical columns
are, in general, earthquake resistant, as proven from the fact that many
classical monuments have survived many strong earthquakes over the centuries.
Nevertheless, the quantitative assessment of their reliability and the
understanding of their dynamic behavior are not easy, because of the
fundamental nonlinear character and the sensitivity of their response. In this
paper, a seismic risk assessment is performed for a multidrum column using
Monte Carlo simulation with synthetic ground motions. The ground motions
adopted contain a high- and low-frequency component, combining the stochastic
method, and a simple analytical pulse model to simulate the directivity pulse
contained in near source ground motions. The deterministic model for the
numerical analysis of the system is three-dimensional and is based on the
Discrete Element Method. Fragility curves are produced conditional on magnitude
and distance from the fault and also on scalar intensity measures for two
engineering demand parameters, one concerning the intensity of the response
during the ground shaking and the other the residual deformation of the column.
Three performance levels are assigned to each engineering demand parameter.
Fragility analysis demonstrated some of the salient features of these spinal
systems under near-fault seismic excitations, as for example, their decreased
vulnerability for very strong earthquakes of magnitude 7 or larger. The
analysis provides useful results regarding the seismic reliability of classical
monuments and decision making during restoration process.

symplectique"". We then set up a model of polarized spinoptics, namely an
extension of geometrical optics accounting for elliptically polarized light
rays in terms of a certain fibre bundle associated with the bundle of Euclidean
frames of a given Riemannian three-manifold. The characteristic foliation of a
natural presymplectic two-form introduced on this bundle via the Ansatz of
minimal coupling is determined, yielding a set of differential equations
governing the trajectory of light, as well as the evolution of polarization in
this Riemannian manifold. Those equations, when specialized to the Fermat
metric (for a slowly varying refractive index), enable us to recover, and
justify, a set of differential equations earlier proposed in the literature, in
another context, namely in terms of a semi-classical limit of wave optics. They
feature a specific anomalous velocity responsible for the recently observed
Spin Hall Effect of Light, namely a tiny spatial deflection of polarized light
rays, transversally to the gradient of the refractive index. Our model,
constructed from the start on purely geometric grounds, turns out to encode
automatically the Berry as well as the Pancharatnam connections that usually

sorted using a stack in terms of forbidden patterns. He also showed that they
are in bijection with Dyck paths and thus counted by the Catalan numbers.
Subsequently, Even \& Itai, Pratt and Tarjan studied permutations that can be
sorted using two stacks in parallel. This problem is significantly harder. In
particular, a sortable permutation can now be sorted by several distinct
sequences of stack operations. Moreover, in order to be sortable, a permutation
must avoid infinitely many patterns. The associated counting question has
remained open for 40 years. We solve it by giving a pair of functional
equations that characterise the generating function of permutations that can be
sorted with two parallel stacks. The first component of this system describes
the generating function Q(a,u) of square lattice loops confined to the positive
quadrant, counted by the length and the number of North-West and East-South
factors. Our analysis of the asymptotic number of sortable permutations relies
at the moment on two intriguing conjectures dealing with the series Q(a,u). We
prove that they hold for loops confined to the upper half plane, or not
confined at all. They remain open for quarter plane loops. Given the recent
activity on walks confined to cones, we believe them to be attractive per se.

led to an improved understanding of red giant stars and binary stars.
Seismology allows us to constrain the properties of red giants. In addition to
eclipsing binaries, eccentric non-eclipsing binaries, exhibiting ellipsoidal
modulations, have been detected with Kepler. We aim to study the properties of
eccentric binary systems containing a red giant star and derive the parameters
of the primary giant component. We apply asteroseismic techniques to determine
masses and radii of the primary component of each system. For a selected
target, light and radial velocity curve modelling techniques are applied to
extract the parameters of the system. The effects of stellar on the binary
system are studied. The paper presents the asteroseismic analysis of 18
pulsating red giants in eccentric binary systems, for which masses and radii
were constrained. The orbital periods of these systems range from 20 to
440days. From radial velocity measurements we find eccentricities between e=0.2
to 0.76. As a case study we present a detailed analysis of KIC5006817. From
seismology we constrain the rotational period of the envelope to be at least
165 d, roughly twice the orbital period. The stellar core rotates 13 times
faster than the surface. From the spectrum and radial velocities we expect that
the Doppler beaming signal should have a maximum amplitude of 300ppm in the
light curve. Through binary modelling, we determine the mass of the secondary
component to be 0.29$\pm$0.03\,$M_\odot$. For KIC5006817 we exclude
pseudo-synchronous rotation of the red giant with the orbit. The comparison of
the results from seismology and modelling of the light curve shows a possible
alignment of the rotational and orbital axis at the 2$\sigma$ level. Red giant
eccentric systems could be progenitors of cataclysmic variables and hot
subdwarf B stars.

SUPCODE pulse sequences for arbitrary single-qubit gates and provide several
explicit examples of sequences that implement commonly used gates, including
the single-qubit Clifford gates. We develop sequences for noise-resistant
two-qubit gates for two exchanged-coupled singlet-triplet qubits by cascading
robust single-qubit gates, leading to a 35% reduction in gate time compared to
previous works. This cascade approach can be scaled up to produce gates for an
arbitrary-length spin qubit array, and is thus relevant to scalable quantum
computing architectures. To more accurately describe real spin qubit
experiments, we show how to design sequences that incorporate additional
features and practical constraints such as sample-specific charge noise models
and finite pulse rise times. We provide a detailed analysis based on randomized
benchmarking to show how SUPCODE gates perform under realistic $1/f^\alpha$

large-scale matter density field, the anisotropies sourced by these processes
are expected to be correlated. We report the first detection of this
cross-correlation signal, which we measure at 6.2 sigma significance using the
Planck data. We take advantage of Planck's multifrequency coverage to construct
a tSZ map using internal linear combination techniques, which we subsequently
cross-correlate with the publicly-released Planck CMB lensing potential map.
[Abridged] We interpret the signal using halo model calculations, which
indicate that the tSZ -- CMB lensing cross-correlation is a unique probe of the
physics of intracluster gas in high-redshift, low-mass groups and clusters. Our
results are consistent with extrapolations of existing gas physics models to
this previously unexplored regime and show clear evidence for contributions
from both the one- and two-halo terms, but no statistically significant
evidence for contributions from diffuse, unbound gas outside of collapsed
halos. We also show that the amplitude of the signal depends rather sensitively
on the amplitude of fluctuations ($\sigma_8$) and the matter density
($\Omega_m$). We constrain the degenerate combination $\sigma_8
(\Omega_m/0.282)^{0.26} = 0.824 \pm 0.029$, a result that is in less tension
with primordial CMB constraints than some recent tSZ analyses. Our detection is
a direct confirmation that hot, ionized gas traces the dark matter distribution
over a wide range of scales in the universe ($\sim 0.1$--$50 \, {\rm Mpc}/h$).

We measure both the halo 3PCF, $\zeta(\theta)$, and the reduced 3PCF,
$Q(\theta)$, at different scales ($2<r\,[$Mpc\h$]<40$) and redshifts ($0\leq
z\leq2$). In all cDE models considered in this work, $Q(\theta)$ appears flat
at small scales (for all redshifts) and at low redshifts (for all scales),
while it builds up the characteristic V-shape anisotropy at increasing
redshifts and scales. With respect to the $\Lambda $CDM predictions, cDE models
show lower (higher) values of the halo 3PCF for perpendicular (elongated)
configurations. The effect is also scale-dependent, with differences between
$\Lambda$CDM and cDE models that increase at large scales. We made use of these
measurements to estimate the halo bias, that results in fair agreement with the
one computed from the two-point correlation function (2PCF). The main advantage
of using both the 2PCF and 3PCF is to break the bias$-\sigma_{8}$ degeneracy.
Moreover, we find that our bias estimates are approximately independent of the
assumed strength of DE coupling. This study demonstrates the power of a
higher-order clustering analysis in discriminating between alternative

However, an alternative interpretation is that the star hosts a disc that is
currently in transition between a full gas disc and a largely gas-free debris
disc. With the help of new optical to mid-IR spectra and Herschel imaging, we
argue that the latter interpretation is supported in several ways: i) we show
that HD 166191 is co-moving with the ~4 Myr-old Herbig Ae star HD 163296,
suggesting that the two have the same age, ii) the disc spectrum of HD 166191
is well matched by a standard radiative transfer model of a gaseous
protoplanetary disc with an inner hole, and iii) the HD 166191 mid-IR silicate
feature is more consistent with similarly primordial objects. We note some
potential issues with the debris disc interpretation that should be considered
for such extreme objects, whose lifetime at the current brightness is mush
shorter than the stellar age, or in the case of the outer component requires a
mass comparable to the solid component of the Solar nebula. These aspects
individually and collectively argue that HD 166191 is a 4-5 Myr old star that
hosts a gaseous transition disc. Though it does not argue in favour of either
scenario, we find strong evidence for 3-5 um disc variability. We place HD
166191 in context with discs at different evolutionary stages, showing that it
is a potentially important object for understanding the protoplanetary to
debris disc transition.

dust distributions that are commonly associated with the dusty torus in active
galactic nuclei (AGN). The Circinus galaxy hosts the closest Seyfert 2 nucleus
and previous interferometric observations have shown that its nuclear dust
emission is well resolved.
  To better constrain the dust morphology in this active nucleus, extensive new
observations were carried out with MIDI at the Very Large Telescope
Interferometer.
  The emission is distributed in two distinct components: a disk-like emission
component with a size of ~ 0.2 $\times$ 1.1 pc and an extended component with a
size of ~ 0.8 $\times$ 1.9 pc. The disk-like component is elongated along PA ~
46{\deg} and oriented perpendicular to the ionisation cone and outflow. The
extended component is elongated along PA ~ 107{\deg}, roughly perpendicular to
the disk component and thus in polar direction. It is interpreted as emission
from the inner funnel of an extended dust distribution and shows a strong
increase in the extinction towards the south-east. We find no evidence of an
increase in the temperature of the dust towards the centre. From this we infer
that most of the near-infrared emission probably comes from parsec scales as
well. We further argue that the disk component alone is not sufficient to
provide the necessary obscuration and collimation of the ionising radiation and
outflow. The material responsible for this must instead be located on scales of
~ 1 pc, surrounding the disk.
  The clear separation of the dust emission into a disk-like emitter and a
polar elongated source will require an adaptation of our current understanding
of the dust emission in AGN. The lack of any evidence of an increase in the
dust temperature towards the centre poses a challenge for the picture of a
centrally heated dust distribution.

dimensional reduction. We determine whether NUT charge can proliferate via the
Polyakov mechanism and partially screen gravitational interactions. In
semiclassical Einstein gravity, Taub-NUT instantons experience a universal
attractive force in the path integral that prevents proliferation. This
attraction further leads to semiclassical clumping instabilities, similar to
the known instabilities of hot flat space and the Kaluza-Klein vacuum. Beyond
pure Einstein gravity, NUT proliferation depends on the following question: is
the mass of a gravitational instanton in the theory always greater than its NUT
charge? Using spinorial methods we show that the answer to this question is
`yes' if all matter fields obey a natural Euclidean energy condition.
Therefore, the attractive force between instantons in the path integral wins
out and gravity is dynamically protected against screening. Semiclassical
gravity with a compactified circle can be self-consistently quantum ordered, at
the cost of suffering from clumping instabilities.

non-linear evolution of dilute ultra-relativistic pair beams propagating
through the IGM. We explore a wide range of beam Lorentz factors gamma_b>>1 and
beam-to-plasma density ratios alpha<<1, so that our results can be extrapolated
to the extreme parameters of blazar-induced beams (gamma_b~10^6 and
alpha~10^(-15), for the most powerful blazars). For cold beams, we show that
the oblique instability governs the early stages of evolution, but its
exponential growth terminates - due to self-heating of the beam in the
transverse direction - when only a negligible fraction
~(alpha/gamma_b)^(1/3)~10^(-7) of the beam energy has been transferred to the
IGM plasma. Further relaxation of the beam proceeds through quasi-longitudinal
modes, until the momentum dispersion in the direction of propagation saturates
at DeltaP_{b,parallel}/gamma_b m_e c ~ 0.2. This corresponds to a fraction ~10%
of the beam energy being ultimately transferred to the IGM plasma, irrespective
of gamma_b or alpha. If the initial dispersion in beam momentum satisfies
DeltaP_{b,parallel}/gamma_b m_e c > 0.2 (as typically expected for
blazar-induced beams), the fraction of beam energy deposited into the IGM is
much smaller than ~10%. It follows that at least ~90% of the beam energy is
still available to power the GeV emission produced by inverse Compton
up-scattering of the Cosmic Microwave Background by the beam pairs.

core mass on the AGB grows rapidly from 10% to 30% for stars with $M_{\rm
initial}$ = 1.6 to 2.0 $M_\odot$. At larger masses, the core-mass growth
decreases steadily to $\sim$10% at $M_{\rm initial}$ = 3.4 $M_\odot$. These
observations are in excellent agreement with predictions from the latest TP-AGB
evolutionary models in Marigo et al. (2013). We also compare to models with
varying efficiencies of the third dredge-up and mass loss, and demonstrate that
the process governing the growth of the core is largely the stellar wind, while
the third dredge-up plays a secondary, but non-negligible role. Based on the
new white dwarf measurements, we perform an exploratory calibration of the most
popular mass-loss prescriptions in the literature. Finally, we estimate the
lifetime and the integrated luminosity of stars on the TP-AGB to peak at $t$

early-type galaxies can be extended to these low-mass systems, except that dEs

We then demonstrate that dE galaxies have lower angular momenta than the
present-day analogues of their presumed late-type progenitors and we show that
dE circular velocity curves are steeper than the rotation curves of galaxies
with equal and up to an order of magnitude higher luminosity. This requires a
transformation mechanism that is not only able to lower the angular momentum

Additionally, we match the dark matter fraction of our galaxies to their
location in the Virgo Cluster and see that galaxies in the cluster outskirts
tend to have a higher dark-to-stellar matter ratio. Transformation due to tidal

mag, utilising the optical/NIR SED. From the afterglow, we determine a bulk
Lorentz factor of Gamma~250 and an emission radius of R<10^18 cm. The

broken power law with b1=-0.3+/-0.1, b2=0.6+/-0.1 that has a break at

Self-absorption by the electron population below energies of E_a<6 keV suggest
a magnetic field strength of B~10^5 G. However, all the best fit models
underpredict the flux observed in the NIR wavelengths, which also only
rebrightens by a factor of ~2 during the second prompt emission episode, in
stark contrast to the X-ray emission, which rebrightens by a factor of ~100,
suggesting an afterglow component is dominating the emission. We present GRB

lattice which is known as the full symmetric Toda lattice. The phase space of
this system is the generic orbit of the coadjoint action of the Borel subgroup
B^+(n) of SL(n,R). This system is integrable. We propose a new method of
constructing semi-invariants and integrals of the full symmetric Toda lattice.
Using only the Toda equations for the Lax eigenvector matrix we prove the
existence of the semi-invariants which are Plucker coordinates in the
corresponding projective spaces. Then we use these semi-invariants to construct
the integrals. It is known that the full symmetric sl(n) Toda lattice has
additional integrals which can be produced by Kostant procedure except for the
integrals which can be derived by the chopping procedure. Altogether these
integrals constitute a full set of the independent non-involutive integrals.
Yet the unsolved complicated technical problem is their explicit derivation
since Kostant procedure has crucial computational complexities even for
low-rank Lax matrices and is practically unapplicable for higher ranks. Our new
approach provides a resolution of this problem and results in simple explicit
formulae for the full set of independent semi-invariants and integrals
expressed both in terms of the Lax matrix and its eigenvector and eigenvalue
matrices of the full symmetric sl(n) Toda lattice without using the chopping
and Kostant procedures. We also describe the structure of the additional
integrals of motion as functions on the flag space modulo the Toda flows and
show how Plucker coordinates of different projective spaces define different
families of the additional integrals. In this paper we present detailed proofs

extracted as Monte Carlo (MC) averages of corresponding multiplicities using
their probabilistic interpretation. To simplify the model and highlight the
possible mechanisms that create this modulation, we choose the elementary
Collins function to be proportional to the elementary unpolarised fragmentation
and a constant probability ($P_{SF}$) for the quark to flip its spin after a
single hadron emission. Moreover, as a leading order calculation, only one of
the produced hadrons in the decay chain of the quark is produced with
elementary Collins modulation. We calculate the dependence of the polarised
DiFFs on various angles such as the azimuthal angle of the single hadron and
the angle of the two hadron production plane $\varphi_R$ for several values of
$P_{SF}$. We observe that the polarised DiFFs for oppositely charged pion pairs
exhibit a $\sin(\varphi_R)$ modulation. This effect is induced purely via the
elementary Collins effect and persists even when the quark completely
depolarises after a single hadron emission ($P_{SF}=0.5$). Moreover, similar

factors (TSSF) and partial radial distribution functions (PRDF) from molecular
dynamics simulations in a single structural model. Goodness-of-fit values to
the O-O, O-H and H-H simulated PRDF-s and to the experimental neutron and X-ray
TSSF provided a measure that can characterize the level of consistency between
interaction potentials and diffraction experiments. Among the sets of partial
RDF-s investigated here, the ones corresponding to the SWM4-DP potential
parameters have proven to be the most consistent with the particular
diffraction results taken for the present study, by a hardly significant margin
ahead of BK3. Perhaps more importantly, it is shown that the three sets of
potential parameters produce nearly equivalent PRDF-s that may all be made
consistent with diffraction data at a very high level. The largest differences
can be detected in terms of the O-O partial radial distribution function.

reduce the time complexity, stochastic ADMM algorithms were proposed to replace
the expected function with a random loss function associated with one uniformly

absorption in sub-surface molecular layers, while only surface molecules are
actually desorbing. The photodesorption spectra of CO and N2 in binary ices
therefore depend on the absorption spectra of the dominant species in the
subsurface ice layer, which implies that the photodesorption efficiency and
energy dependence are dramatically different for mixed and layered ices
compared to pure ices. In particular, a thin (1-2 ML) N2 ice layer on top of CO
will effectively quench CO photodesorption, while enhancing N2 photodesorption
by a factors of a few (compared to the pure ices) when the ice is exposed to a
typical dark cloud UV field, which may help to explain the different
distributions of CO and N2H+ in molecular cloud cores. This indirect
photodesorption mechanism may also explain observations of small amounts of
complex organics in cold interstellar environments.

the instability can be triggered by an axisymmetric bump at some radius $r_0$

non-axisymmetric perturbation [$\propto \exp({\rm i}m\phi)$, $m=1,2..$] in the
vicinity of $r_0$ consisting of {\it anticyclonic} vortices. These vortices are
regions of high pressure and consequently act to trap dust particles which in

quasi-periodic modulations of the disc's thermal emission.

more balanced (cross helicity $\sim 0$) and equipartitioned (residual energy
$\sim 0$) have steep structure functions reminiscent of ""turbulent"" scalings
usually associated with the inertial range. Fluctuations that are magnetically
dominated (residual energy $\sim -1$), and so have closely anti-aligned
Elsasser-field vectors, or imbalanced (cross helicity $\sim 1$), and so have
closely aligned magnetic and velocity vectors, have wide `$1/f$' ranges typical
of fast solar wind. We conclude that the strength of nonlinear interactions of
individual fluctuations within a stream, diagnosed by the degree of correlation
in direction and magnitude of magnetic and velocity fluctuations, determines
the extent of the $1/f$ region observed and thus the onset scale for the

fluctuating force gives infinite instantaneous acceleration of the mirror. We
show that this infinite fluctuating force and infinite instantaneous
acceleration make sense because they will not result in infinite fluctuation of
the mirror's position. On the contrary, the mirror's fluctuating motion will be
confined in a small region due to two special properties of the quantum vacuum:
(1) the vacuum friction which resists the mirror's motion and (2) the strong
anti-correlation of vacuum fluctuations which constantly changes the direction
of the mirror's infinite instantaneous acceleration and thus cancels the effect
of infinities to make the fluctuation of the mirror's position finite.

W_r(2796)=0.4-1.1A reside in relatively massive halos with < log M_h > \approx
12.5^{+0.6}_{-1.3}, while stronger absorbers reside in halos of similar or
lower masses < log M_h > \approx 11.6^{+0.9}. We compared our bias data points,
b, and the frequency distribution function of absorbers, f_{W_r}, with a simple
model incorporating an isothermal density profile to mimic the distribution of
absorbing gas in halos. We also compared the bias data points with Tinker &
Chen (2008) who developed halo occupation distribution models of MgII absorbers
that are constrained by b and f_{W_r}. The simple isothermal model can be ruled
at a \approx 2.8\sigma level mostly because of its inability to reproduce
f_{W_r}. However, b values are consistent with both models, including TC08. In
addition, we show that the mean b of absorbers does not decrease beyond
W_r(2796) \approx 1.6A. The flat or potential upturn of b for Wr(2796) \gtrsim
1.6A absorbers suggests the presence of additional cool gas in massive halos.

life expectancy at birth was lower for females than for males in India
(posterior probability for 1971--1976 0.79), although there was strong evidence

strong evidence for the more usual result that life expectancy at birth was
greater for females and, in Thailand, that the difference increased over the

  Purpose: We intend to study the configuration mixing phenomenon in the Hg
isotopes and to understand how different observables are influenced by it.
  Method: We study in detail a long chain of mercury isotopes, $^{172-200}$Hg,
using the interacting boson model with configuration mixing. The parameters of
the Hamiltonians are fixed through a least square fit to the known energies and
absolute B(E2) transition rates of states up to $3$ MeV.
  Results: We obtained the IBM-CM Hamiltonians and we calculate excitation
energies, B(E2)'s, quadrupole shape invariants, wave functions, isotopic
shifts, and mean field energy surfaces.
  Conclusions: We obtain a fairly good agreement with the experimental data for
all the studied observables and we conclude that the Hamiltonian and the states
we obtain constitute a good approximation to the Hg isotopes.

various numerical studies, but not strictly proven. Here by using a unitary
transformation to decompose the Hamiltonian into two branches of odd and even
parity we obtained the necessary and sufficient condition for degeneracy to
occur between states of opposite parity in the spin-boson model, and the
analytical expression for such degenerate energies. It can be strictly proven
that the ground state of spin-boson model with non-vanishing tunneling
amplitude must have an energy lower than the lowest possible such degenerate
energy, and have definite parity. Starting from the invariancy of the parity
operator we show that finite expansion by numerical calculation induces the
breaking of parity symmetry responsible for the phase transition. The critical
dissipation parameter we obtained for parity-symmetry breaking, as a
logarithmic function of summed diagonal matrix elements in the finite expansion
for the bosonic part of the parity operator, can reproduce the phase diagram
derived with quantum Monte Carlo method and logarithmically discretized
numberical renormalization group approach. It reveals that the quantum phase
transition in spin-boson model claimed by numerical procedures arises from
symmetry breaking caused by finite expansion in practical calculation. The
method we developed here may also be applicable to the discussion of quantum

quantum system is at the foundation of statistical mechanics and a subject of
interest in such diverse areas as cold atom physics or the quantum mechanics of
black holes. Since a pure state can never evolve into a thermal density matrix,
the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) has been put forward by Deutsch
and Srednicki as a way to explain this apparent thermalization, similarly to
what the ergodic theorem does in classical mechanics. In this paper this
hypothesis is tested numerically. First, it is observed that thermalization
happens in a subspace of states (the Krylov subspace) with dimension much
smaller than that of the total Hilbert space. We check numerically the validity
of ETH in such a subspace, for a system of hard core bosons on a
two-dimensional lattice. We then discuss how well the eigenstates of the
Hamiltonian projected on the Krylov subspace represent the true eigenstates.
This discussion is aided by bringing the projected Hamiltonian to the
tridiagonal form and interpreting it as an Anderson localization problem for a
finite one-dimensional chain. We also consider thermalization of a subsystem
and argue that generation of a large entanglement entropy can lead to a thermal
density matrix for the subsystem well before the whole system thermalizes.
Finally, we comment on possible implications of ETH in quantum gravity.

Gammaproteobacteria. Under anaerobic conditions and the presence of nitrate, P.
aeruginosa can perform (complete) denitrification, a respiratory process of
dissimilatory nitrate reduction to nitrogen gas via nitrite ($NO_{2}$), nitric
oxide ($NO$) and nitrous oxide ($N_{2}O$). This study focuses on understanding
the influence of environmental conditions on bacterial denitrification
performance, using a mathematical model of a metabolic network in P.

denitrification for this bacterium. Analysis of the long-term behavior of the
network under changing concentration levels of oxygen ($O_{2}$), nitrate

strongly affects denitrification performance. The model provides five
predictions on denitrification activity of P. aeruginosa under various
environmental conditions, and these predictions are either experimentally
validated or supported by pertinent biological literature. One motivation for
this study is to capture the effect of $PO_{4}$ on a denitrification metabolic
network of P. aeruginosa in order to shed light on mechanisms for greenhouse

singularity of the formed black hole is examined via mesh refinement and
asymptotic analysis. Before the collapse, the scalar degree of freedom f' is
coupled to a physical scalar field, and general relativity is restored. During
the collapse, the major energy of the physical scalar field moves to the
center. As a result, f' loses the coupling and becomes light, and gravity
transits from general relativity to f(R) gravity. Due to strong gravity from
the singularity and the low mass of f', f' will cross the minimum of the
potential and approach zero. Therefore, the dynamical solution is significantly
different from the static solution of the black hole in f(R) gravity---it is
not the de Sitter-Schwarzschild solution as one might have expected. f' tries
to suppress the evolution of the physical scalar field, which is a dark energy
effect. As the singularity is approached, metric terms are dominant over other
terms. The Kasner solution for spherical scalar collapse in f(R) theory is
obtained and confirmed by numerical results. These results support the

halos as spherical overdensities with respect to an evolving density threshold.
Here, we critically investigate the evolutionary effects of several such
commonly used definitions and compare them to the halo evolution within fixed
physical scales as well as to the evolution of other intrinsic physical
properties of dark matter halos. It is shown that, in general, the traditional
way of characterizing sizes and masses of halos dramatically overpredicts the
degree of evolution in the last 10 Gyr, especially for low-mass halos. This
pseudo-evolution leads to the illusion of growth even though there are no major
changes within fixed physical scales. Such formal size definitions also serve
as proxies for the virialized region of a halo in the literature. In general,
those spherical overdensity scales do not coincide with the virialized region.
A physically more precise nomenclature would be to simply characterize them by
their very definition instead of calling such formal size and mass definitions
'virial'. In general, we find a discrepancy between the evolution of the
underlying physical structure of dark matter halos seen in cosmological
structure formation simulations and pseudo-evolving formal virial quantities.
We question the importance of the role of formal virial quantities currently
ubiquitously used in descriptions, models and relations that involve properties
of dark matter structures. Concepts and relations based on pseudo-evolving
formal virial quantities do not properly reflect the actual evolution of dark
matter halos and lead to an inaccurate picture of the physical evolution of our

XBee wireless communication module based on IEEE 802.15.4 standard while the
robot has inherent FPGA board as a processing unit with xbee module connected
via Rs-2332 cable for serial communication between zigbee device and FPGA. A
simple custom packet is designed so that uniformity is maintained while

MAP inference over Probabilistic Graphical Models. However, different LP
relaxations often have different objective functions and variables of differing

addition, the computational complexity of LP relaxation-based methods grows
quickly with the number of constraints. Reducing the number of constraints

  We propose a unified formulation under which existing MAP LP relaxations may

Polytope Diagrams allows the number of constraints to be reduced without
loosening the LP relaxations. Then, using Marginal Polytope Diagrams and
constraint reduction, we develop three novel message passing algorithms, and
demonstrate that two of these show a significant improvement in speed over
state-of-art algorithms while delivering a competitive, and sometimes higher,

well-observed with the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). We explore
how the shape of the generic RR Lyrae mid-infrared light curve evolves in
period-space, comparing light curves in mid-infrared and optical bands. We find
that optical light curves exhibit high amplitudes and a large spectrum of light
curve shapes, while mid-infrared light curves have low amplitudes and uniform
light curve shapes. From the period-space analysis, we hope to improve the
classification methods of RR Lyrae variables and enable reliable discovery of
these pulsators in the WISE catalog and future mid-infrared surveys such as the
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We provide mid-infrared templates for
typical RR Lyrae stars and demonstrate how these templates can be applied to
improve estimates of mid-infrared RR Lyrae mean magnitude, which is used for
distance measurement. This method of template fitting is particularly
beneficial for improving observational efficiency. For example, using light
curves with observational noise of 0.05 mag, we obtain the same level of
accuracy in mean magnitude estimates for light curves randomly sampled at 12
data points with template fitting as with light curves randomly sampled at 20
data points with harmonic modelling.

correspondence with relational models theory (RMT), a theory of human social
relationships. RMT posits four elementary models of relationships governing
human interactions, singly or in combination: Communal Sharing, Authority
Ranking, Equality Matching, and Market Pricing. To these are added the limiting
cases of asocial and null interactions, whereby people do not coordinate with
reference to any shared principle. Our model is rooted in the observation that
each individual in a dyadic interaction can do either the same thing as the
other individual, a different thing or nothing at all. To represent these three
possibilities, we consider two individuals that can each act in one out of
three ways toward the other: perform a social action X or Y, or alternatively
do nothing. We demonstrate that the relationships generated by this model
aggregate into six exhaustive and disjoint categories. We propose that four of
these categories match the four relational models, while the remaining two
correspond to the asocial and null interactions defined in RMT. We generalize
our results to the presence of N social actions. We infer that the four
relational models form an exhaustive set of all possible dyadic relationships
based on social coordination. Hence, we contribute to RMT by offering an answer
to the question of why there could exist just four relational models. In
addition, we discuss how to use our representation to analyze data sets of
dyadic social interactions, and how social actions may be valued and matched by
the agents.

many files, while simultaneously detecting duplicate records within files. Our
key innovation involves the representation of the pattern of links between
records as a bipartite graph, in which records are directly linked to latent
true individuals, and only indirectly linked to other records. This flexible
representation of the linkage structure naturally allows us to estimate the
attributes of the unique observable people in the population, calculate
transitive linkage probabilities across records (and represent this visually),
and propagate the uncertainty of record linkage into later analyses. Our method
makes it particularly easy to integrate record linkage with post-processing
procedures such as logistic regression, capture-recapture, etc. Our linkage
structure lends itself to an efficient, linear-time, hybrid Markov chain Monte
Carlo algorithm, which overcomes many obstacles encountered by previously
record linkage approaches, despite the high-dimensional parameter space. We
illustrate our method using longitudinal data from the National Long Term Care
Survey and with data from the Italian Survey on Household and Wealth, where we
assess the accuracy of our method and show it to be better in terms of error
rates and empirical scalability than other approaches in the literature.

characterize the narrow resonance width. Deeply inside the width of a narrow
Feshbach resonance, we find the second virial coefficient evolves with the
effective range from the well-known universal value 1/4 in the broad-resonance

Fermi gas is more strongly interacted at the narrow resonance. In addition, far
beyond the resonance width, we find the harmonically trapped Fermi gas still

results can be directly tested in current narrow Feshbach resonance
experiments, which are generally carried out in a harmonic trap.

Standard approaches for filtering assume that a probabilistic model for
observations (i.e. the observation model) is given explicitly or at least
parametrically. We consider a setting where this assumption is not satisfied;
we assume that the knowledge of the observation model is only provided by
examples of state-observation pairs. This setting is important and appears when
state variables are defined as quantities that are very different from the
observations. We propose Kernel Monte Carlo Filter, a novel filtering method
that is focused on this setting. Our approach is based on the framework of
kernel mean embeddings, which enables nonparametric posterior inference using
the state-observation examples. The proposed method represents state
distributions as weighted samples, propagates these samples by sampling,
estimates the state posteriors by Kernel Bayes' Rule, and resamples by Kernel
Herding. In particular, the sampling and resampling procedures are novel in
being expressed using kernel mean embeddings, so we theoretically analyze their
behaviors. We reveal the following properties, which are similar to those of
corresponding procedures in particle methods: (1) the performance of sampling
can degrade if the effective sample size of a weighted sample is small; (2)
resampling improves the sampling performance by increasing the effective sample
size. We first demonstrate these theoretical findings by synthetic experiments.
Then we show the effectiveness of the proposed filter by artificial and real
data experiments, which include vision-based mobile robot localization.

dependence on the transverse electromagnetic potential; for a non-zero density

the ponderomotive force of a very intense and short plane laser pulse hitting
normally the surface of a plasma boosts the surface electrons into the ion

the electric force exerted by the ions and may leave the plasma with high

quantum interactive proof systems (also called quantum Arthur-Merlin games).
While prior works focused on classical public coins even in the quantum
setting, the present work introduces a generalized version of quantum
Arthur-Merlin games where the public coins can be quantum as well: the verifier
can send not only random bits, but also halves of EPR pairs. First, it is
proved that the class of two-turn quantum Arthur-Merlin games with quantum
public coins, denoted qq-QAM in this paper, does not change by adding a
constant number of turns of classical interactions prior to the communications
of the qq-QAM proof systems. This can be viewed as a quantum analogue of the
celebrated collapse theorem for AM due to Babai. To prove this collapse
theorem, this paper provides a natural complete problem for qq-QAM: deciding
whether the output of a given quantum circuit is close to a totally mixed
state. This complete problem is on the very line of the previous studies
investigating the hardness of checking the properties related to quantum
circuits, and is of independent interest. It is further proved that the class
qq-QAM_1 of two-turn quantum-public-coin quantum Arthur-Merlin proof systems
with perfect completeness gives new bounds for standard well-studied classes of
two-turn interactive proof systems. Finally, the collapse theorem above is
extended to comprehensively classify the role of interaction and public coins
in quantum Arthur-Merlin games: it is proved that, for any constant m>1, the
class of problems having an m-turn quantum Arthur-Merlin proof system is either
equal to PSPACE or equal to the class of problems having a two-turn quantum
Arthur-Merlin game of a specific type, which provides a complete set of quantum
analogues of Babai's collapse theorem.

persistence measures for long memory fractionally integrated processes. The
bootstrap method is based on the semi-parametric sieve approach, with the
dynamics in the long memory process captured by an autoregressive

applied to data pre-filtered by a semi-parametric estimate of the long memory
parameter. Both versions of the bootstrap technique are used to estimate the
finite sample distributions of the sample autocorrelation coefficients and the
impulse response coefficients and, in turn, to bias-adjust these statistics.
The accuracy of the resultant estimators in the case of the autocorrelation
coefficients is also compared with that yielded by analytical bias adjustment
methods when available. The basic sieve technique is seen to yield a reduction
in the bias of both persistence measures. The pre-filtered sieve produces a
substantial further reduction in the bias of the estimated impulse response
function, whilst the extra improvement yielded by pre-filtering in the case of
the sample autocorrelation function is shown to depend heavily on the accuracy
of the pre-filter.

We extend this result to the case where two Langevin reservoirs at different
temperatures are connected via a conductor made of interacting particles, and
are subjected to an external drive or work source. The Langevin reservoirs are
characterized by Gaussian white noise fluctuations and concomitant friction
coefficients. We first derive the Crooks theorem for the ratio between forward

modified detailed fluctuation theorems (MDFT) for the heat exchanged at each
end. These theorems differ from the usual form of the detailed fluctuation
theorems (DFT) in literature, due the presence of an extra multiplicative
factor. This factor quantifies the deviation of our MFDT from the DFT. Finally,
we numerically study our model, with only two interacting particles for
simplicity.

bijections to vector spaces (over a fixed field); informally, one can view this
as a sequence of $S_n$-modules. A Hopf monoid (in the category of vector
species) consists of a vector species with unit, counit, product, and coproduct
morphisms satisfying several compatibility conditions, analogous to a graded
Hopf algebra. A vector species has a basis if and only if it is given by a
sequence of $S_n$-modules which are permutation representations. We say that a
Hopf monoid is freely self-dual if it is connected and finite-dimensional, and
if it has a basis in which the structure constants of its product and coproduct
coincide. Such Hopf monoids are self-dual in the usual sense, and we show that
they are furthermore both commutative and cocommutative. We prove more specific
classification theorems for freely self-dual Hopf monoids whose products
(respectively, coproducts) are linearized in the sense that they preserve the
basis; we call such Hopf monoids strongly self-dual (respectively, linearly
self-dual). In particular, we show that every strongly self-dual Hopf monoid
has a basis isomorphic to some species of block-labeled set partitions, on
which the product acts as the disjoint union. In turn, every linearly self-dual
Hopf monoid has a basis isomorphic to the species of maps to a fixed set, on
which the coproduct acts as restriction. It follows that every linearly
self-dual Hopf monoid is strongly self-dual. Our final results concern
connected Hopf monoids which are finite-dimensional, commutative, and
cocommutative. We prove that such a Hopf monoid has a basis in which its
product and coproduct are both linearized if and only if it is strongly
self-dual with respect to a basis equipped with a certain partial order,
generalizing the refinement partial order on set partitions.

suppose that the receiver is performing joint maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding,
optimizing a MIMO MAC code against a fixed error event leads to a situation
where the joint codewords of the users in error can be seen as a single user
MIMO code. In such a case pair-wise error probability (PEP) based determinant
criterion of Tarokh et al. can be used to upper bound the error probability.
  It was already proven by Lahtonen et al. that irrespective of the used codes
the determinants of the differences of codewords of the overall codematrices
will decay as a function of the rates of the users.
  This work will study this decay phenomenon further and derive upper bounds
for the decay of determinants corresponding any error event. Lower bounds for
the optimal decay are studied by constructions based on algebraic number theory
and Diophantine approximation. For some error profiles the constructed codes
will be proven to be optimal.
  While the perspective of the paper is that of PEP, the final part of the

to assess the performance of phylogenetic reconstruction methods. BEAST, a
Bayesian statistical framework that focuses on reconstructing time-calibrated
molecular evolutionary processes, supports a wide array of evolutionary models,
but lacked matching machinery for simulation of character evolution along
phylogenies.
  Results: We present a flexible Monte Carlo simulation tool, called piBUSS,
that employs the BEAGLE high performance library for phylogenetic computations
within BEAST to rapidly generate large sequence alignments under complex
evolutionary models. piBUSS sports a user-friendly graphical user interface
(GUI) that allows combining a rich array of models across an arbitrary number
of partitions. A command-line interface mirrors the options available through
the GUI and facilitates scripting in large-scale simulation studies. Analogous
to BEAST model and analysis setup, more advanced simulation options are
supported through an extensible markup language (XML) specification, which in
addition to generating sequence output, also allows users to combine simulation
and analysis in a single BEAST run.
  Conclusions: piBUSS offers a unique combination of flexibility and
ease-of-use for sequence simulation under realistic evolutionary scenarios.
Through different interfaces, piBUSS supports simulation studies ranging from
modest endeavors for illustrative purposes to complex and large-scale
assessments of evolutionary inference procedures. The software aims at
implementing new models and data types that are continuously being developed as

These defects are either intrinsic, or are induced by the addition of dopants.
We study here PbTiO$_3$ (the end member of a key family of solid solutions) in
the presence of acceptor (Fe) and donor (Nb) dopants, and the interactions of
the different defects and defect associates with the domain walls. For the case
iron acceptors, the calculations point to the formation of defect associates
involving an iron substitutional defect and a charged oxygen vacancy
(Fe$^{'}_{Ti}$-V$^{^{\textbf{..}}}_O$). This associate exhibits a strong
tendency to align in the direction of the bulk polarization; in fact, ordering
of defects is also observed in pure PbTiO$_3$ in the form of lead-oxygen
divacancies. Conversely, calculations on donor-doped PbTiO$_3$ do not indicate
the formation of polar defect complexes involving donor substitutions. Last, it
is observed that both isolated defects in donor-doped materials and defect
associates in acceptor-doped materials are more stable at 180$^o$ domain walls.
However, polar defect complexes lead to asymmetric potentials at domain walls
due to the interaction of the defect polarization with the bulk polarization.
The relative pinning characteristics of different defects are then compared, to
develop an understanding of defect-domain wall interactions in both doped and
pure PbTiO$_3$. These results may also help understanding hardening and
softening mechanisms in PZT.

are becoming urgent for experimentalists and are currently gaining much
attention. We show that, in spite of the fact that the respective field
strength is still essentially less than $E_S=m^2c^3/e\hbar=1.32\cdot

at ELI and XCELS facilities. The most promissory for observation is the effect
of pair creation by laser pulse in vacuum. It is shown, that at intensities
$\sim 5\cdot 10^{25}$W/cm$^2$, creation even of a single pair is accompanied by
development of an avalanchelike QED cascade. There exists an important
distinctive feature of the laser-induced cascades, as compared with the air
showers arising due to primary cosmic ray entering the atmosphere. In our case
the laser field plays not only the role of a target (similar to a nucleus in
the case of air showers). It is responsible also for acceleration of slow
particles. It is shown that the effect of pair creation imposes a natural limit
for attainable laser intensity. Apparently, the field strength $E\sim E_S$ is

first contribution in this paper is then an exhaustive survey and
categorization of centrality indices along several attributes including the
type of information (local vs. global) and processing complexity required for
their computation. We next study the seven most popular of those indices in the
context of Internet vulnerability to address issues that remain under-explored
in literature so far. First, we carry out a correlation study to assess the
consistency of the node rankings those indices generate over ISP router-level
topologies. For each pair of indices, we compute the full ranking correlation,
which is the standard choice in literature, and the percentage overlap between
the k top nodes. Then, we let these rankings guide the removal of highly
central nodes and assess the impact on both the connectivity properties and
traffic-carrying capacity of the network. Our results confirm that the top-k
overlap predicts the comparative impact of indices on the network vulnerability
better than the full-ranking correlation. Importantly, the locally computed
degree centrality index approximates closely the global indices with the most
dramatic impact on the traffic-carrying capacity; whereas, its approximative
power in terms of connectivity is more topology-dependent.

Our specific approach is to study how the energetic cost of moving an ion or a
pair of ions to a less coordinated site at the surface of various NaCl crystals
varies with the number of water molecules adsorbed on the surface. This
""microsolvation"" approach allows us to study the dependence of the defect
energies on the number of water molecules in the cluster and thus to establish
when and where dissolution becomes favorable. Moreover, this approach allows us
to understand the roles of the individual ions and water molecules in the
dissolution process. Consistent with previous work we identify a clear
preference for dissolution of Cl ions over Na ions. However, the detailed
information obtained here leads to the conclusion that the process is governed
by the higher affinity of the water molecules to Na ions than to Cl ions. The
Cl ions are released first as this exposes more Na ions at the surface creating
favorable adsorption sites for water. We discuss how this mechanism is likely

ensemble-of-forests approach can accurately recover sparse, possibly
disconnected MRF topologies, even in presence of non-Gaussian dependencies
and/or low sample size. We applied the ensemble-of-forests model to learn the
structure of perturbed signaling networks of immune cells and found that these
frequently exhibit non-Gaussian dependencies with disconnected MRF topologies.
In summary, we expect that the ensemble-of-forests model will enable MRF
structure learning in other high dimensional real world settings that are
governed by non-trivial dependencies.

proposed by using different notions of fractional derivatives and integrals.
Although the literature of the fractional calculus of variations is already

stellar mass (M*) relation, as well as the quiescent fraction versus M*
relation in different environments. We confirm that the fraction of quiescent
galaxies is strongly dependent on environment at a fixed stellar mass, but that
the amplitude and the slope of the star-forming sequence is similar between the
field and groups: in other words, the SSFR-density relation at a fixed stellar
mass is primarily driven by the change in the star-forming and quiescent
fractions between different environments rather than a global suppression in
the star formation rate for the star-forming population. However, when we
restrict our sample to the cluster-scale environments ($M>10^{14}M_{solar}$),
we find a global reduction in the SSFR of the star forming sequence of $17\%$
at 4$\sigma$ confidence as opposed to its field counterpart. After removing the
stellar mass dependence of the quiescent fraction seen in field galaxies, the
excess in the quiescent fraction due to the environment quenching in groups and
clusters is found to increase with stellar mass. We argue that these results
are in favor of galaxy mergers to be the primary environment quenching
mechanism operating in galaxy groups whereas strangulation is able to reproduce
the observed trend in the environment quenching efficiency and stellar mass
relation seen in clusters. Our results also suggest that the relative
importance between mass quenching and environment quenching depends on stellar
mass -- the mass quenching plays a dominant role in producing quiescent
galaxies for more massive galaxies, while less massive galaxies are quenched
mostly through the environmental effect, with the transition mass around
$1-2\times10^{10}M_{solar}$ in the group/cluster environment. (abridged)

density maps of the observations and a set of matched simulations incorporating

uncertainties), we first confirm that the observed ~15 comoving Mpc scale
galaxy clustering is consistent with LCDM models. Using further the relation
between high-z overdensity and the present day cluster mass calibrated in these
matched simulations, we found 36 candidate structures at 1.6<z<3.1, showing
overdensities consistent with the progenitors of M_z=0 ~10^15 M_sun clusters.
Taking into account the significant upward scattering of lower mass structures,
the probabilities for the candidates to have at least M_z=0 ~10^14 M_sun are
~70%. For each structure, about 15%-40% of photometric galaxy candidates are
expected to be true proto-cluster members that will merge into a cluster-scale

algorithm is robust. This work generates a large sample of uniformly-selected

the CPR maps of the crater interiors. It is shown that the CPRs of crater
interiors in unrectified maps are biased to larger values than crater
exteriors, because of a combination of the effects of parallax and incidence
angle. Using the LOLA Digital Elevation Map (DEM), the variation of CPR with
angle of incidence has been studied. For fresh craters, CPR~0.7 with only a
weak dependence on angle of incidence or position interior or just exterior to
the crater, consistent with dihedral scattering from blocky surface roughness.
For anomalous craters, the CPR interior to the crater increases with both
incidence angle and distance from the crater centre. Central crater CPRs are
similar to those in the crater exteriors. CPR does not appear to correlate with
temperature within craters. Furthermore, the anomalous polar craters have
diameter-to-depth ratios that are lower than those of typical polar craters.
These results strongly suggest that the high CPR values in anomalous polar

anomalous craters are of intermediate age, and maintain sufficiently steep

be used as an ophthalmology consultation decision support system. The
implementation of this application involves several different tasks and one of
them is the implementation of an ophthalmology images registration algorithm.
The work reported in this document is related with the implementation of an
algorithm to register images of angiography, colour retinography and redfree
retinography. The implementations described were developed in the software
MATLAB.
  The implemented algorithm is based in the detection of the bifurcation points
(y-features) of the vascular structures of the retina that usually are visible
in the referred type of images. There are proposed two approaches to establish
an initial set of features correspondences. The first approach is based in the
maximization of the mutual information of the bifurcation regions of the
features of images. The second approach is based in the characterization of
each bifurcation point and in the minimization of the Euclidean distance
between the descriptions of the features of the images in the descriptors
space. The final set of the matching features for a pair of images is defined
through the application of the RANSAC algorithm.
  Although, it was not achieved the implementation of a full functional
algorithm, there were made several analysis that can be important to future
improvement of the current implementation.

particularly convenient feature of the cyclotomic theory is the fact that any

  Questions pertaining to the $p$-adic local Langlands correspondence lead us
to ask for a generalization of the theory of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules, with
the cyclotomic extension replaced by an infinitely ramified $p$-adic Lie
extension $K_\infty / K$. It is not clear what shape such a generalization
should have in general. Even in the case where we have such a generalization,
namely the case of a Lubin-Tate extension, most $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules fail
to be overconvergent.
  In this article, we develop an approach that gives a solution to both
problems at the same time, by considering the locally analytic vectors for the
action of $\Gamma$ inside some big modules defined using Fontaine's rings of
periods. We show that, in the cyclotomic case, we recover the ususal
overconvergent $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules. In the Lubin-Tate case, we can
prove, as an application of our theory, a folklore conjecture in the field
stating that $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules attached to $F$-analytic

Both experimental and theoretical EELS data reveal the resonance behavior

describe physics below a certain scale model-independently. Above that energy
scale, identified with the cutoff, the EFT description breaks down and new
physics is expected to appear, as confirmed in many familiar examples in
quantum field theory. In this work, we examine the validity of effective field
theory methods applied to inflation. We address the issue of whether
Planck-suppressed non-renormalizable interactions are suppressed enough to be
safely neglected when computing inflationary predictions. We focus on
non-derivative non-renormalizable operators and estimate the cutoff that should
suppress them using two independent approaches: (i) the usual unitarity and
perturbativity argument, (ii) by computing the UV-divergent part of the
inflaton entropy, known to scale as the square of the UV-cutoff. We find that
in the absence of gravity (decoupling limit) the cutoff appears to depends
linearly on the total inflaton excursion. On the other hand, once gravity is
restored, the cutoff is brought back to the Planck scale. These results suggest
that inflationary scenarios with super-Planckian excursion are not natural from
the EFT viewpoint.

of Ehrenpreis) distributions stable. They simultaneously generalise the
operation of convolution by a distribution with compact support and the
operation of multiplication by a real analytic function; they are here called
pseudo-convolutions since they also generalise pseudo-differential operators.
(It is shown that the elliptic real analytic pseudo-differential operators
leave both the non-invertible and the invertible distributions invariant.) But
when the condition of real-analyticity is relaxed, such operators may map a
non-invertible distribution to one invertible -- given that the invertibility
in both cases concerns the same function space. By varying the space, however,
one can measure the 'loss of non-invertibily' that a non-analytic perturbation

Denjoy-Carleman sense; the Gevrey case turns out particularly simple.

sequential distributive phosphorylation are therefore studied frequently. In
particular, in {\em Wang and Sontag, 2008,} it is shown that models of $n$-site
sequential distributive phosphorylation admit at most $2n-1$ steady states.
Wang and Sontag furthermore conjecture that for odd $n$, there are at most $n$

is not true: building on earlier work in {\em Holstein et.al., 2013}, we
present a scalar determining equation for multistationarity which will lead to
parameter values where a $3$-site system has $5$ steady states and parameter
values where a $4$-site system has $7$ steady states. Our results therefore are
counterexamples to the conjecture of Wang and Sontag. We furthermore study the
inherent geometric properties of multistationarity in $n$-site sequential
distributive phosphorylation: the complete vector of steady state ratios is
determined by the steady state ratios of free enzymes and unphosphorylated
protein and there exists a linear relationship between steady state ratios of
phosphorylated protein.

Spin-period pulsations from the rotation of the white dwarf are seen in optical

constrain the size and location of the accretion footprints on the white-dwarf
surface. Tracing these back along field lines can tell us about the transition
region between the stream or disk and the magnetosphere. Further, optical
emission lines give us velocity information, while analysis of eclipses gives
spatial information.

of geometric effects and absorption by the accretion flow, and appear to show
that the accretion disk feeds onto field lines differently in different

  During outbursts, when the accretion flow increases by orders of magnitude,
the disk pushes the magnetosphere inwards, and appears to feed field lines over

theory, and research in quantum reference frames. The research in the former
category provides a fundamental construction of quantum information theory of
localised qubits in curved spacetimes. For example, this concerns quantum
experiments on free-space photons and electrons in the vicinity of the Earth.
From field theory a description of localised qubits that traverse classical
trajectories in curved spacetimes is obtained, for photons and massive spin-1/2
fermions. The equations governing the evolution of the two-dimensional quantum
state and its absolute phase are determined. Quantum information theory of
these qubits is then developed. The Stern-Gerlach measurement formalism for
massive spin-1/2 fermions is also derived from field theory. In the latter
category of research, the process of changing reference frames is considered
for the case where the reference frames are quantum systems. As part of this
process, it is shown that decoherence is necessarily induced on any quantum
system described relative to these frames. This process is explored using
examples involving quantum reference frames for phase and orientation.
Quantifying the effect of changing quantum reference frames provides a
theoretical description for this process in quantum experiments, and serves as
a first step in developing a relativity principle for theories in which all
objects including reference frames are necessarily quantum.

CO(1-0) luminosities are in the range $L'_{\rm CO} \sim (5 - 9) \times 10^{10}$

these two systems is M$_{\rm H2} \sim 6 \times 10^{10}\, {\rm M}_{\odot}$
(M$_{\rm H2}$/$L'_{\rm CO}$=0.8). For the remaining three CO-detected sources,
the CO(1-0) emission is located in the halo (~50-kpc) environment. These three
HzRGs are among the fainter far-IR emitters in our sample, suggesting that
similar reservoirs of cold molecular halo gas may have been missed in earlier
studies due to pre-selection of IR-bright sources. In all three cases the
CO(1-0) is aligned along the radio axis and found beyond the brightest radio
hot-spot, in a region devoid of 4.5$\mu$m emission in Spitzer imaging. The
CO(1-0) profiles are broad, with velocity widths of ~ 1000 - 3600 km/s. We
discuss several possible scenarios to explain these halo reservoirs of CO(1-0).
Following these results, we complement our CO(1-0) study with detections of
extended CO from the literature and find at marginal statistical significance
(95% level) that CO in HzRGs is preferentially aligned towards the radio jet
axis. For the eight sources in which we do not detect CO(1-0), we set realistic
upper limits of $L'_{\rm CO} \sim 3-4 \times 10^{10}$ K km/s pc$^{2}$. Our
survey reveals a CO(1-0) detection rate of 38%, allowing us to compare the
CO(1-0) content of HzRGs with that of other types of high-z galaxies.

X-ray, radio, optical, and infrared. We find that the shell of 0540-69.3 is
characterized in the X-ray by thermal nonequilibrium plasma with depleted Mg
and Si abundances and a temperature of kT ~ 0.7 keV. This thermal emission is
superimposed with synchrotron emission in several regions. Based on X-ray
spectra and on morphological considerations in all surveyed wavebands, we
conclude that the shell is expanding into a clumpy and highly inhomogeneous
medium. In one region of the shell we find an overabundance of Ne, suggesting
the presence of ejecta near the edge of the remnant. We also see evidence for
reheating of material via a reverse shock originating from the interaction of
the supernova blast wave with a particularly dense cloud in the surrounding
medium. Finally, we perform the first detailed study of the ""halo"" region
extending 1.2-2.2 pc from the central pulsar. We detect the presence of thermal
and nonthermal spectral components but do not find evidence for mixing or
ejecta. We conclude that the thermal component is not a counterpart to similar
optical and infrared halos and that it is most likely due to the projection of
shell material along the line of sight.

analyses. This is especially true for Bayesian hierarchical models, where
interpretability of the parameters within deeper layers in the hierarchy
becomes challenging. In addition, lack of information together with
identifiability issues may imply that the prior distributions for such models
have an undesired influence on the posterior inference. Despite its relevance,
informal approaches to prior sensitivity analysis are currently used. They
require repetitive re-runs of the model with ad-hoc modified base prior
parameter values. Other formal approaches to prior sensitivity analysis suffer
from a lack of popularity in practice, mainly due to their high computational
cost and absence of software implementation. We propose a novel formal approach
to prior sensitivity analysis which is fast and accurate. It quantifies
sensitivity without the need for a model re-run. We develop a ready-to-use
priorSens package in R for routine prior sensitivity investigation by R-INLA.
Throughout a series of examples we show how our approach can be used to detect
high prior sensitivities of some parameters as well as identifiability issues

type galaxy with a central surface brightness minimum arising from an apparent
stellar ring, which is misaligned with respect to the galaxy's major axis at
larger radii. We fit new HST/STIS and archival data with axisymmetric orbit
models to determine $M$, mass-to-light ratio ($\Upsilon_V$), and dark matter
halo profile. The best-fit model parameters with 1$\sigma$ uncertainties are $M
= (6.0^{+0.7}_{-0.9}) \times 10^8\ M_{\scriptscriptstyle \odot}$ and
$\Upsilon_V = 6.0 \pm 0.2\ M_{\scriptscriptstyle \odot}\ L_{{\scriptscriptstyle
\odot},V}^{-1}$ at an assumed distance of 46 Mpc. The models are inconsistent
with no black hole at a significance of $\Delta\chi^2 = 15.4$ and require a
dark matter halo to adequately fit the kinematic data, but the fits are
consistent with a large range of plausible dark matter halo parameters. The
ring is inconsistent with a population of co-rotating stars on circular orbits,
which would produce a narrow line-of-sight velocity distribution (LOSVD).
Instead, the ring's LOSVD has a small value of $|V|/\sigma$, the ratio of mean
velocity to velocity dispersion. Based on the observed low $|V|/\sigma$, our
orbit modeling, and a kinematic decomposition of the ring from the bulge, we
conclude that the stellar ring contains stars that orbit in both directions. We
consider potential origins for this unique feature, including multiple tidal
disruptions of stellar clusters, a change in the gravitational potential from
triaxial to axisymmetric, resonant capture and inclining of orbits by a binary
black hole, and multiple mergers leading to gas being funneled to the center of
the galaxy.

Indeed, given a relational database (one relation) represented as a set of

binary table (Bitmap table) containing binary numbers. Then, we use this Bitmap
table to construct a data structure called Peano Tree stored as a binary file
on which we apply a new algorithm called BF-ARM (extension of the well known
Apriori algorithm). Since the database is loaded into a binary file, our
proposed algorithm will traverse this file, and the processes of association
rules extractions will be based on the file stored on disk. The BF-ARM
algorithm is implemented and compared with Apriori, Apriori+ and RS-Rules+
algorithms. The evaluation process is based on three benchmarks (Mushroom, Car
Evaluation and Adult). Our preliminary experimental results showed that our
algorithm produces association rules with a minimum time compared to other
algorithms.

A BATS code consists of an outer code and an inner code. The outer code is a
matrix generation of a fountain code, which works with the inner code that
comprises random linear coding at the intermediate network nodes. In this
paper, the performance of finite-length BATS codes is analyzed with respect to
both belief propagation (BP) decoding and inactivation decoding. Our results
enable us to evaluate efficiently the finite-length performance in terms of the
number of batches used for decoding ranging from 1 to a given maximum number,
and provide new insights on the decoding performance. Specifically, for a fixed
number of input symbols and a range of the number of batches used for decoding,
we obtain recursive formulae to calculate respectively the stopping time
distribution of BP decoding and the inactivation probability in inactivation
decoding. We also find that both the failure probability of BP decoding and the
expected number of inactivations in inactivation decoding can be expressed in a
power-sum form where the number of batches appears only as the exponent. This
power-sum expression reveals clearly how the decoding failure probability and
the expected number of inactivation decrease with the number of batches. When
the number of batches used for decoding follows a Poisson distribution, we
further derive recursive formulae with potentially lower computational
complexity for both decoding algorithms. For the BP decoder that consumes
batches one by one, three formulae are provided to characterize the expected
number of consumed batches until all the input symbols are decoded.

Syntactic signature based detection cannot cope with such growth and manual
construction of malware signature databases needs to be replaced by computer
learning based approaches. Currently, a single modern signature capturing the
semantics of a malicious behavior can be used to replace an arbitrarily large
number of old-fashioned syntactical signatures. However teaching computers to
learn such behaviors is a challenge. Existing work relies on dynamic analysis
to extract malicious behaviors, but such technique does not guarantee the
coverage of all behaviors. To sidestep this limitation we show how to learn
malware signatures using static reachability analysis. The idea is to model
binary programs using pushdown systems (that can be used to model the stack
operations occurring during the binary code execution), use reachability
analysis to extract behaviors in the form of trees, and use subtrees that are
common among the trees extracted from a training set of malware files as
signatures. To detect malware we propose to use a tree automaton to compactly
store malicious behavior trees and check if any of the subtrees extracted from
the file under analysis is malicious. Experimental data shows that our approach
can be used to learn signatures from a training set of malware files and use
them to detect a test set of malware that is 5 times the size of the training

fractionally-dissipative media. These viscoelastic models are such that the
attenuation is frequency dependent and follows a power law with non-integer
exponent. As a prototypical example, the Andrade model is chosen for its
simplicity and its satisfactory fits of experimental flow laws in rocks and
metals. The corresponding constitutive equation features a fractional
derivative in time, a non-local term that can be expressed as a convolution
product which direct implementation bears substantial memory cost. To
circumvent this limitation, a diffusive representation approach is deployed,
replacing the convolution product by an integral of a function satisfying a
local time-domain ordinary differential equation. An associated quadrature
formula yields a local-in-time system of partial differential equations, which
is then proven to be well-posed. The properties of the resulting model are also
compared to those of the original Andrade model. The quadrature scheme
associated with the diffusive approximation, and constructed either from a
classical polynomial approach or from a constrained optimization method, is
investigated to finally highlight the benefits of using the latter approach.
Wave propagation simulations in homogeneous domains are performed within a
split formulation framework that yields an optimal stability condition and
which features a joint fourth-order time-marching scheme coupled with an exact
integration step. A set of numerical experiments is presented to assess the
efficiency of the diffusive approximation method for such wave propagation
problems.

emission and the absence of optical emission lines. Optical measurements,
however, suffer strongly from extinction and the absence of pronounced
short-time gamma-ray variability over years of monitoring is unusual for a
blazar. We are combining new and archival multiwavelength data in order to
reconsider the classification and nature of this unusual gamma-ray source. For
the first time, we study the radio morphology at 8.4GHz and 22.3GHz, and its
spectral properties on milliarcsecond (mas) scales, based on VLBI observations
from the TANAMI program. We combine the resulting images with multiwavelength
data in the radio, IR, optical/UV, X-ray, and gamma-ray regimes. PMNJ1603-4904
shows a symmetric brightness distribution at 8.4GHz on mas-scales, with the
brightest, and most compact component in the center of the emission region. The
morphology is reminiscent of a Compact Symmetric Object (CSO). Such objects
have been predicted to produce gamma-ray emission but have not been detected as
a class by Fermi/LAT so far. Sparse (u, v)-coverage at 22.3GHz prevents an
unambiguous modeling of the source morphology. IR measurements reveal an excess
in the spectral energy distribution (SED), which can be modeled with a
blackbody with a temperature of about 1600K, and which is usually not present
in blazar SEDs. The VLBI data and the shape of the SED challenge the current
blazar classification. PMNJ1603-4904 seems to be either a highly peculiar BL
Lac object or a misaligned jet source. In the latter case, the intriguing VLBI
structure opens room for a possible classification as a gamma-ray bright CSO.

to conflicting values of $\alpha_s$. Recently, we performed a systematic study

Improved Perturbation Theory (CIPT). The yet unknown higher order coefficients

within these RGI frameworks some of the commonly employed moments should be
avoided due to their poor perturbative behavior. Furthermore, under reasonable

describing a method that is used in DR10/11 analyses presented in companion

due to the precision that BOSS can now reach: even using as many as 600 mock
catalogues to estimate covariance of 2-point clustering measurements can still
lead to an increase in the errors of ~20%, depending on how the cosmological

integrating over the likelihood, and to the distribution of recovered best-fit

Both are situations that previous analyses of BOSS have considered. We apply

lines can exhibit asymmetric profiles, with enhanced emissions at their blue
wings. These asymmetries correspond to rapidly upflowing plasmas at speeds
exceeding ~ 50 km/s. Here, we perform a study of the density of the rapidly
upflowing material and compare it to that of the line core which corresponds to
the bulk of the plasma. For this task we use spectroscopic observations of
several active regions taken by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer of
the Hinode mission. The density sensitive ratio of the Fe XIV lines at 264.78
and 274.20 A is used to determine wing and core densities. We compute the ratio
of the blue wing density to the core density and find that most values are of
order unity. This is consistent with the predictions for coronal nanoflares if
most of the observed coronal mass is supplied by chromospheric evaporation
driven by the nanoflares. However, much larger blue wing-to-core density ratios
are predicted if most of the coronal mass is supplied by heated material
ejected with type II spicules. Our measurements do not rule out a spicule
origin for the blue wing emission, but they argue against spicules being a
primary source of the hot plasma in the corona. We note that only about 40% of
the pixels where line blends could be safely ignored have blue wing asymmetries
in both Fe XIV lines. Anticipated sub-arcsecond spatial resolution
spectroscopic observations in future missions could shed more light on the

two intermediate-age star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud, NGC 1831 and

exhibit extended main-sequence turn-offs. To explain the observations, we
consider variations in helium abundance, binarity, age dispersions, and fast
rotation of the clusters' member stars. The observed narrow main sequence
excludes significant variations in helium abundance in both clusters. We first
establish the clusters' main-sequence binary fractions using the bulk of the
clusters' main-sequence stellar populations >1 mag below their turn-offs. The
extent of the turn-off regions in color--magnitude space, corrected for the
effects of binarity, implies that age spreads of order 300 Myr may be inferred
for both clusters if the stellar distributions in color--magnitude space were
entirely due to the presence of multiple populations characterized by an age
range. Invoking rapid rotation of the population of cluster members
characterized by a single age also allows us to match the observed data in
detail. However, when taking into account the extent of the red clump in
color--magnitude space, we encounter an apparent conflict for NGC 1831 between
the age dispersion derived from that based on the extent of the main-sequence
turn-off and that implied by the compact red clump. We therefore conclude that,
for this cluster, variations in stellar rotation rate are preferred over an age
dispersion. For NGC 1868, both models perform equally well.

${\rm{Re}}_{\lambda}\approx 100$. The measurement volume is located in the

properties. The experimental results show how the turbulence evolves from
almost isotropic 3D turbulence ($\Omega\lesssim 0.2$ rad/s) to quasi-2D
turbulence ($\Omega\approx 5.0$ rad/s) and how this is reflected by several
statistical quantities. In particular, we have studied the orientation of the
vorticity vector with respect to the three eigenvectors of the local strain
rate tensor and with respect to the vortex stretching vector. Additionally, we
have quantified the role of system rotation on the self-amplification terms of
the enstrophy and strain rate equations and the direct contribution of the
background rotation on these evolution equations. The main effect is the strong
reduction of extreme events and related (strong) reduction of the skewness of

gives a higher success rate. Also, the accuracy of reconstruction is much
better even for cases where small number of linear measurements are available.
Our claim is supported by empirical results obtained using our algorithm and
its comparison to other existing methods for matrix recovery. The algorithms
are compared on the basis of NMSE, execution time and success rate for varying
ranks and sampling ratios.

  Xeon Phi Accelerator",,,,,"cs.DC cs.CV cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We examine the Xeon Phi, which is based on Intel's Many Integrated Cores
architecture, for its suitability to run the FDK algorithm--the most commonly
used algorithm to perform the 3D image reconstruction in cone-beam computed
tomography. We study the challenges of efficiently parallelizing the
application and means to enable sensible data sharing between threads despite
the lack of a shared last level cache. Apart from parallelization, SIMD
vectorization is critical for good performance on the Xeon Phi; we perform
various micro-benchmarks to investigate the platform's new set of vector
instructions and put a special emphasis on the newly introduced vector gather
capability. We refine a previous performance model for the application and
adapt it for the Xeon Phi to validate the performance of our optimized
hand-written assembly implementation, as well as the performance of several
different auto-vectorization approaches.

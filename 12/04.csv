Most of these inanimate systems are polymers that compute their structures and
dynamics using as input seemingly random character strings of their sequence,
following which they coalesce and perform integrated cellular functions. In
large computational systems with a finite interaction-codes, the appearance of
conflicting goals is inevitable. Simple conflicting forces can lead to quite
complex structures and behaviors, leading to the concept of ""frustration"" in
condensed matter. We present here some basic ideas about frustration in
biomolecules and how the frustration concept leads to a better appreciation of
many aspects of the architecture of biomolecules, and how structure connects to
function. These ideas are simultaneously both seductively simple and perilously
subtle to grasp completely. The energy landscape theory of protein folding
provides a framework for quantifying frustration in large systems and has been
implemented at many levels of description. We first review the notion of
frustration from the areas of abstract logic and its uses in simple condensed
matter systems. We discuss then how the frustration concept applies
specifically to heteropolymers, testing folding landscape theory in computer
simulations of protein models and in experimentally accessible systems.
Studying the aspects of frustration averaged over many proteins provides ways
to infer energy functions useful for reliable structure prediction. We discuss
how frustration affects folding, how a large part of the biological functions
of proteins are related to subtle local frustration effects and how frustration
influences the appearance of metastable states, the nature of binding
processes, catalysis and allosteric transitions. We hope to illustrate how
Frustration is a fundamental concept in relating function to structural
biology.

with the COLIBRI code. We adopt our preferred scheme for dust growth. For
M-giants, we neglect chemisputtering by H$_2$ molecules and, for C-stars we
assume a homogeneous growth scheme which is primarily controlled by the carbon
over oxygen excess. At super-solar metallicities, dust forms more efficiently
and silicates tend to condense significantly closer to the photosphere (r~1.5
R$_*$) - and thus at higher temperatures and densities - than at solar and
sub-solar metallicities (r~2-3 R$_*$). In such conditions, the hypothesis of
thermal decoupling between gas and dust becomes questionable, while dust
heating due to collisions plays an important role. The heating mechanism delays
dust condensation to slightly outer regions in the circumstellar envelope. We
find that the same mechanism is not significant at solar and sub-solar
metallicities. The main dust products at super-solar metallicities are
silicates. We calculate the total dust ejecta and dust-to-gas ejecta, for
various values of the stellar initial masses and initial metallicities Z=0.04,
0.06. Merging these new calculations with those for lower metallicities it
turns out that, contrary to what often assumed, the total dust-to-gas ejecta of
intermediate-mass stars exhibit only a weak dependence on the initial metal

effects. We argue that the negative-energy Hawking modes need to be regularly
integrated out; and so these are effectively subsumed by the BH and, as a
result, the number of coherent negative-energy modes $N_{coh}$ at any given
time is parametrically smaller than the total number of the Hawking particles
$N_{total}$ emitted during the lifetime of the BH. We find that $N_{coh}$ is
determined by the width of the BH wavefunction and scales as the square root of
the BH entropy. We also find that the coherent negative-energy modes are
strongly entangled with their positive-energy partners. Previously, we have
found that $N_{coh}$ is also the number of coherent outgoing particles and that
information can be continually transferred to the outgoing radiation at a rate
set by $N_{coh}$. Our current results show that, while the BH is semiclassical,
information can be released without jeopardizing the nearly maximal inside-out
entanglement and imply that the state of matter near the horizon is
approximately the vacuum. The BH firewall proposal, on the other hand, is that
the state of matter near the horizon deviates substantially from the vacuum,
starting at the Page time. We find that, under the usual assumptions for
justifying the formation of a firewall, one does indeed form at the Page time.
However, the possible loophole lies in the implicit assumption that the number
of strongly entangled pairs can be of the same order of $N_{total}$.

calculating Ramsey dynamics exactly for two interacting spin-1/2 particles in a

clusters raises several questions about the formation and evolution of the two
(or more) generations of stars. These populations show differences in their age
and chemical composition. These differences are found in old- and intermediate-
age stellar clusters in the Local Group. The observations of young stellar
systems are expected to present footprints of multiple stellar populations.
  Aims: This theoretical work intends to be a specific step in exploring the
space of the observational indicators of multipopulations, without covering all
the combinations of parameters that may contribute to the formation of multiple
generations of stars in a cluster or in galaxy. The goal is to shed light on
the possible observational features expected by core He-burning stars that
belong to two stellar populations with different original He content and ages.
  Methods: The tool adopted was the stellar population synthesis. We used new
stellar and pulsation models to construct a homogeneous and consistent
framework. Synthetic color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of young- and
intermediate-age stellar systems (from 20 Myr up to 1 Gyr) were computed in
several photometric bands to derive possible indicators of double populations
both in the observed CMDs and in the pulsation properties of the Cepheids.
  Results: We predict that the morphology of the red/blue clump in VIK bands
can be used to photometrically indicate the two stellar populations in a rich
assembly of stars if there is a significant difference in their original He
content. Moreover, the period distribution of the Cepheids appears to be widely
affected by the coeval multiple generations of stars within stellar systems. We
show that the Wesenheit relations may be affected by the helium content of the
Cepheids.

sources of cold molecular radicals for cold collision and chemical reaction
experiments. In order to use these beams in studies of reactions with
controlled collision energies, or in trapping experiments, one needs a method
of controlling the forward velocity of the beam. A Stark decelerator can be an
effective tool for controlling the mean speed of molecules produced by
supersonic jets, but efficient deceleration of buffer-gas beams presents new
challenges due to longer pulse lengths. Traveling-wave decelerators are
uniquely suited to meet these challenges because of their ability to confine
molecules in three dimensions during deceleration and the versatility afforded
by the analog control of the electrodes. We have created ground state
CH($X^2\Pi$) radicals in a cryogenic buffer-gas cell with the potential to
produce a cold molecular beam of $10^{11}$ mol./pulse. We present a general
protocol for Stark deceleration of beams with large position and velocity
spreads for use with a traveling-wave decelerator. Our method involves
confining molecules transversely with a hexapole for an optimized distance
before deceleration. This rotates the phase-space distribution of the molecular
packet so that the packet is matched to the time varying phase-space acceptance
of the decelerator. We demonstrate with simulations that this method can
decelerate a significant fraction of the molecules in successive wells of a
traveling-wave decelerator to produce energy-tuned beams for cold and
controlled molecule experiments.

Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) fields where
we have a rich multi-wavelength data set. We took a new approach to decompose
the FIR sources, using the near-IR or the optical images directly for position
priors. This is an improvement over the previous decomposition efforts where
the priors are from mid-IR data that still suffer from the source blending
problem in the first place. We found that in most cases the single Herschel
sources are made of multiple components that are not necessarily at the same
redshifts. Our decomposition succeeded in identifying and extracting their
major contributors. We show that these are all ULIRGs at z ~ 1--2 whose high
L_IR is mainly due to dust-obscured star formation. Most of them would not be
selected as sub-mm galaxies. They all have complicated morphologies indicative
of merger or violent instability, and their stellar populations are
heterogeneous in terms of stellar masses, ages and formation histories. Their
current ULIRG phases are of various degrees of importance in their stellar mass
assembly. Our practice provides a promising starting point to develop an

physicality, yet it is well known that correlated initial states need not give
rise to completely positive evolutions. This observation spurred numerous
investigations over the past two decades attempting to identify necessary and
sufficient conditions for complete positivity. Here we describe a complete and
consistent mathematical framework for the discussion and analysis of complete
positivity for correlated initial states of open quantum systems. This
formalism is built upon a few simple axioms and is sufficiently general to
contain all prior methodologies going back to Pechakas, PRL (1994). The key
observation is that initial system-bath states with the same reduced state on
the system must evolve under all admissible unitary operators to system-bath
states with the same reduced state on the system, in order to ensure that the
induced dynamical maps on the system are well-defined. Once this consistency
condition is imposed, related concepts like the assignment map and the
dynamical maps are uniquely defined. In general, the dynamical maps may not be
applied to arbitrary system states, but only to those in an appropriately
defined physical domain. We show that the constrained nature of the problem
gives rise to not one but three inequivalent types of complete positivity.
Using this framework we elucidate the limitations of recent attempts to provide
conditions for complete positivity using quantum discord and the quantum
data-processing inequality. The problem remains open, and may require fresh
perspectives and new mathematical tools. The formalism presented herein may be

static graph algorithms are not sufficient. To be useful in practice (e.g. when
used by a telecom analyst), the stability of the partitions becomes critical.
We tackle this particular use case in this paper: tracking evolution of
communities in dynamic scenarios with focus on stability. We propose two
modifications to a widely used static community detection algorithm: we
introduce fixed nodes and preferential attachment to pre-existing communities.

exists a non-vanishing gap between the optimal bandwidth-storage tradeoff of

the exact-repair regenerating codes. To obtain an explicit information
theoretic converse, a computer-aided proof (CAP) approach based on primal and

programming (LP) method, which was previously only used on information
theoretic problems with a few random variables due to the exponential growth of
the number of variables in the corresponding LP problem. The symmetry in the

galactic nuclei (AGN). The key idea of RM is to measure the time lag $\tau$
between variations in the continuum emission from the accretion disc and
subsequent response of the broad line region (BLR). The measurement of $\tau$
is typically used to estimate the physical size of the BLR and is combined with
other measurements to estimate the black hole mass $M_{\rm BH}$. A major
difficulty with RM campaigns is the large amount of data needed to measure
$\tau$. Recently, Fine et al (2012) introduced a new approach to RM where the
BLR light curve is sparsely sampled, but this is counteracted by observing a
large sample of AGN, rather than a single system. The results are combined to
infer properties of the sample of AGN. In this letter we implement this method
using a hierarchical Bayesian model and contrast this with the results from the
previous stacked cross-correlation technique. We find that our inferences are
more precise and allow for more straightforward interpretation than the stacked
cross-correlation results.

lines of highly ionized iron can origin in upper parts of the disk atmosphere

computed with natural, thermal and pressure broadenings match very well
observations. We showed that the accretion disk atmosphere can effectively
produce iron absorption lines observed in 4U 1630-472 spectrum. Absorption line
arising in accretion disk atmosphere is the important part of the observed line
profile, even if there are also other mechanisms responsible for the absorption
features. Nevertheless, the wind theory can be an artifact of the fitting
procedure, when the continuum and lines are fitted as separate model
components.

A-star {\beta} Pictoris is known to contain gas. Evidence points towards a
secondary origin of the gas as opposed to being a direct remnant form the
initial protoplanetary disk, although the dominant gas production mechanism is
so far not identified. The origin of the observed overabundance of C and O
compared to solar abundances of metallic elements, e.g. Na and Fe, is also
unclear. Aims: Our goal is to constrain the spatial distribution of C in the
disk, and thereby the gas origin and its abundance pattern. Methods: We used
the HIFI instrument onboard Herschel to observe and spectrally resolve CII
emission at 158 $\mu$m from the {\beta} Pic debris disk. Assuming Keplerian
rotation, we use the spectrally resolved line profile to constrain the spatial
distribution of the gas. Results: We show that most of the gas is located
around $\sim$100 AU or beyond. We estimate a total C gas mass of
$1.3\times10^{-2}$ M$_\oplus$. The data suggest that more gas is located on the
southwest side of the disk than on the northeast side. The data are consistent
with the hypothesis of a well-mixed gas (constant C/Fe ratio throughout the
disk). Assuming instead a spatial profile expected from a simplified accretion
disk model, we found it to give a significantly worse fit to the observations.
Conclusions: Since the bulk of the gas is found outside 30 AU, we argue that
the cometary objects known as ""falling evaporating bodies"" are unlikely to be
the dominant source of gas; production from grain-grain collisions or
photodesorption seems more likely. The incompatibility of the observations with
a simplified accretion disk model could favour a preferential depletion
explanation for the overabundance of C and O. More stringent constraints on the
spatial distribution will be available from ALMA observations of CI at 609
$\mu$m.

heuristic for matrix completion and related low-rank optimization problems.
Theoretical guarantees for Alternating Minimization have been hard to come by
and are still poorly understood. This is in part because the heuristic is
iterative and non-convex in nature. We give a new algorithm based on
Alternating Minimization that provably recovers an unknown low-rank matrix from
a random subsample of its entries under a standard incoherence assumption. Our
results reduce the sample size requirements of the Alternating Minimization
approach by at least a quartic factor in the rank and the condition number of
the unknown matrix. These improvements apply even if the matrix is only close
to low-rank in the Frobenius norm. Our algorithm runs in nearly linear time in
the dimension of the matrix and, in a broad range of parameters, gives the
strongest sample bounds among all subquadratic time algorithms that we are
aware of.
  Underlying our work is a new robust convergence analysis of the well-known
Power Method for computing the dominant singular vectors of a matrix. This
viewpoint leads to a conceptually simple understanding of Alternating
Minimization. In addition, we contribute a new technique for controlling the
coherence of intermediate solutions arising in iterative algorithms based on a
smoothed analysis of the QR factorization. These techniques may be of interest
beyond their application here.

scotogenic model, in which neutrinos get mass radiatively via one-loop

particles in the model to be fermionic cold dark matter and taking into account
various constraints, including those from LHC Higgs experiments, we show that
LEP II data on e+e- scattering into a pair of charged leptons plus missing
energy can place significant extra restrictions on the parameter space
containing sufficiently low masses of the charged scalars in the model. On the
other hand, LEP II data on e+e- collisions into a photon plus missing energy do
not yield strong constraints. The allowed parameter space can still accommodate
Higgs exotic decays into the nonstandard particles and thus is testable at the
LHC. We also consider using future measurements of these two types of e+e-
scattering at the International Linear Collider to examine the scenario of
interest further and find that they can provide complementary information about
it, whether or not they reveal scotogenic effects.

studied in the presence of time-varying correlated side information at the
receiver. A block fading model is considered for both the channel and the side
information, whose states are assumed to be known only at the receiver. The
optimality of separate source and channel coding in terms of average end-to-end
distortion is shown when the channel is static while the side information state
follows a discrete or a continuous and quasiconcave distribution. When both the
channel and side information states are time-varying, separate source and
channel coding is suboptimal in general. A partially informed encoder lower
bound is studied by providing the channel state information to the encoder.
Several achievable transmission schemes are proposed based on uncoded
transmission, separate source and channel coding, joint decoding as well as
hybrid digital-analog transmission. Uncoded transmission is shown to be optimal
for a class of continuous and quasiconcave side information state
distributions, while the channel gain may have an arbitrary distribution. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first example in which the uncoded
transmission achieves the optimal performance thanks to the time-varying nature
of the states, while it is suboptimal in the static version of the same
problem. Then, the optimal \emph{distortion exponent}, that quantifies the
exponential decay rate of the expected distortion in the high SNR regime, is
characterized for Nakagami distributed channel and side information states, and
it is shown to be achieved by hybrid digital-analog and joint decoding schemes
in certain cases, illustrating the suboptimality of pure digital or analog
transmission in general.

identify in total 10861 compact sub-millimeter sources with fluxes above 5

point source catalogues (MSX at 21.3 $\mu$m and WISE at 22 $\mu$m) and
determine a lower limit of ~33% that are associated with embedded protostellar
objects. We note that the proportion of clumps associated with mid-infrared

fraction of ~75% of all clumps with fluxes over 5 Jy/beam being associated with
star-formation. Examining the source counts as a function of Galactic longitude
we are able to identify the most prominent star forming regions in the Galaxy.

X-ray binaries. The model uses the fact that at high luminosities, the inner
radii of radiation pressure dominated accretion discs are expected to i) become
effectively optically thin and ii) produce significant luminosities. The gas
temperature therefore rises sharply inwards, producing local saturated Compton
spectra with rapidly increasing peak energy. These spectra sum together to form
a steep power law tail to the spectrum. A given photon energy on this tail
corresponds to a narrow range in radius, so that local vertical oscillations of
the disc naturally produce high quality high-frequency quasi-periodic
oscillations (HFQPOs) in the hard X-ray band. The two lowest order modes have a
robust frequency ratio of ~1.53. This model explains the appearance of steep
power law spectra and HFQPOs at high luminosity, the 3:2 HFQPO frequency
ratios, and their association with the power law spectral component. We predict
an increase in QPO quality factor when the power spectrum is restricted to a
narrower photon energy band, and an increase in HFQPO frequency at higher X-ray
energies or lower luminosities. Future X-ray telescopes could detect additional
HFQPOs from higher order modes. We demonstrate how this model could be used to
measure black hole spin from HFQPOs, and qualitatively estimate the spin of GRO
J1655-40 as a/M ~ 0.4 - 0.7.

data of Cygnus X-1 taken with the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias and the 4.2-m
William Herschel Telescope. We show that the broadband, radio to gamma-ray flux
spectrum and polarization spectrum in the hard state are largely consistent
with a simple phenomenological model of a strongly polarized synchrotron jet,
an unpolarized Comptonized corona and a moderately polarized interstellar dust
component. In this model, the origin of the gamma-ray, X-ray and some of the
infrared polarization is the optically thin synchrotron power law from the
inner regions of the jet. The model requires the magnetic field in this region
to be highly ordered and perpendicular to the axis of the resolved radio jet.
This differs to studies of some other X-ray binaries, in which the magnetic
field is turbulent, variable and aligned with the jet axis. The model is able
to explain the approximate polarization strength and position angle at all
wavelengths including the detected X-ray (3 - 5 keV) polarization, except the
observed position angle of the gamma-ray polarization, which differs to the
model by ~ 60 degrees. Past numerical modelling has shown that a curved
synchrotron spectrum can produce a shift in position angle by ~ 60 degrees,
which may account for this.

MACSJ1720.2+3536 (z = 0.391), RXJ1532.9+3021 (z = 0.345), and Abell 383 (z =
0.187), respectively. Each SN was detected in Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
optical and infrared images. Based on photometric classification, we find that
SNe CLO12Car and CLN12Did are likely to be Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), while
the classification of SN CLA11Tib is inconclusive. Using multi-color
light-curve fits to determine a standardized SN Ia luminosity distance, we
infer that SN CLO12Car was approximately 1.0 +/- 0.2 mag brighter than field
SNe Ia at a similar redshift and ascribe this to gravitational lens
magnification. Similarly, SN CLN12Did is approximately 0.2 +/- 0.2 mag brighter
than field SNe Ia. We derive independent estimates of the predicted
magnification from CLASH strong+weak lensing maps of the clusters: 0.83 +/-
0.16 mag for SN CLO12Car, 0.28 +/- 0.08 mag for SN CLN12Did, and 0.43 +/- 0.11
mag for SN CLA11Tib. The two SNe Ia provide a new test of the cluster lens
model predictions: we find that the magnifications based on the SN Ia

herald the promise of future observations of samples of cluster-lensed SNe Ia

free-free emission from the starburst. We have compiled a spectral energy
distribution (SED) of SBS0335-052 that spans almost 6 orders of magnitude in
wavelength and fit it with a spherical dust shell heated by a single-age
stellar population; the best-fit model gives a dust mass of (3.8+/-0.6)x10^4

IZw18, another low-metallicity dwarf starburst (12+log(O/H)=7.17), and fit it
with a similar model to obtain a dust mass of (3.4+/-1.0)x10^2 Msun. Compared
with their atomic gas mass, the dust mass of SBS0335-052 far exceeds the
prediction of a linear trend of dust-to-gas mass ratio with metallicity, while
IZw18 falls far below. We use gas scaling relations to assess a putative
missing gas component in both galaxies and find that the missing, possibly
molecular, gas in SBS0335-052 is a factor of 6 times higher than the value
inferred from the observed HI column density; in IZw18 the missing component is
4 times smaller. Ultimately, despite their similarly low metallicity, the
differences in gas and dust column densities in SBS0335-052 and IZw18 suggest
that metal abundance does not uniquely define star-formation processes. At some
level, self-shielding and the survival of molecules may depend just as much on
gas and dust column density as on metallicity. The effects of low metallicity
may at least be partially compensated for by large column densities in the
interstellar medium.

dependence of the concentration of equilibrium cold dark matter (CDM) halos. We
extend earlier work on the relation between halo mass profiles and assembly
histories to show how the latter may be used to predict concentrations for
halos of all masses and at any redshift. Our results clarify the link between
concentration and the ``collapse redshift'' of a halo as well as why
concentration depends on mass and redshift solely through the dimensionless
``peak height'' mass parameter, $\nu(M,z)=\delta_{\rm crit}(z)/\sigma(M,z)$. We
combine these results with analytic mass accretion histories to extrapolate the
$c(M,z)$ relations to mass regimes difficult to reach through direct
simulation. Our model predicts that, at given $z$, $c(M)$ should deviate
systematically from a simple power law at high masses, where concentrations
approach a constant value, and at low masses, where concentrations are
substantially lower than expected from extrapolating published empirical fits.
This correction may reduce the expected self-annihilation boost factor from
substructure by about one order of magnitude. The model also reproduces the
$c(M,z)$ dependence on cosmological parameters reported in earlier work, and
thus provides a simple and robust account of the relation between cosmology and
the mass-concentration-redshift relation of CDM halos.

which six are found to be at a redshift of $z\sim2.9$, and possibly constitute
an interacting system. Using a novel forward-modelling approach, we are able to
simultaneously deblend and fit SEDs to the individual galaxies that contribute
to the giant submm arc, constraining their dust temperatures, far infrared
luminosities and star formation rates. The submm arc first identified by SCUBA
can now be seen to be composed of at least five distinct sources, four of these
within the galaxy group at $z\sim2.9$. The total unlensed luminosity for this
galaxy group is $(3.1\pm0.3) \times 10^{12}\,\mathrm{L}_\odot$, which gives an
unlensed star formation rate of $(450\pm50)$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. From the
properties of this system, we see no evidence of evolution towards lower
temperatures in the dust temperature versus far-infrared luminosity relation
for high redshift galaxies.

outflow rate is coupled to the instantaneous protostellar accretion rate and
evolution. We vary the outflow collimation angle from $\theta$=0.01-0.1 and
find that even well collimated outflows effectively sweep up and entrain
significant core mass. The Stage 0 lifetime ranges from 0.14-0.19 Myr, which is
similar to the observed Class 0 lifetime. The star formation efficiency of the
cores spans 0.41-0.51. In all cases, the outflows drive strong turbulence in
the surrounding material. Although the initial core turbulence is purely
solenoidal by construction, the simulations converge to approximate
equipartition between solenoidal and compressive motions due to a combination
of outflow driving and collapse. When compared to a simulation of a cluster of
protostars, which is not gravitationally centrally condensed, we find that the
outflows drive motions that are mainly solenoidal. The final turbulent velocity
dispersion is about twice the initial value of the cores, indicating that an
individual outflow is easily able to replenish turbulent motions on sub-parsec
scales. We post-process the simulations to produce synthetic molecular line
emission maps of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O and evaluate how well
these tracers reproduce the underlying mass and velocity structure.

the parent cores and the protostars, the astronomical community needs a large
enough data base of infrared images of protostars at the highest spatial
resolution possible, to reveal the details of their morphology. Spitzer
provides unprecedented sensitivity in the infrared to study both the jet and
outflow features, however its spatial resolution is limited by its 0.85m
mirror. Here we use a high resolution deconvolution algorithm, ""HiRes"", to
improve the visualization of spatial morphology by enhancing resolution (to
sub-arcsecond levels in the IRAC bands) and removing the contaminating
sidelobes from bright sources in a sample of 89 protostellar objects. These
reprocessed images are useful to detect: (i) wide angle outflow seen in
scattered light; (ii) morphological details of H2 emission in jets and bow
shocks; and (iii) compact features in MIPS 24 micron images as protostar/ disk
and atomic/ionic line emissions associated with the jets. The HiRes fits image
data of such a large homogeneous sample presented here will be useful to the
community in studying these protostellar objects. To illustrate the utility of
this HiRes sample, we show how the opening angle of the wide angle outflows in
31 sources, all observed in the HiRes processed Spitzer images, correlates with
age. Our data suggest a power law fit to opening angle versus age with an
exponent of ~0.32 and 0.02, respectively for ages less than 8000 yr and greater
than 8000 yr.

optimal isometric embedding in [26] to transplant Killing fields in the
Minkowski spacetime back to the 2-surface of interest in a physical spacetime.
To each optimal isometric embedding, a dual element of the Lie algebra of the
Lorentz group is assigned. Quasi-local angular momentum and quasi-local center
of mass correspond to pairing this element with rotation Killing fields and
boost Killing fields, respectively. They obey classical transformation laws
under the action of the Poincar\'e group. We further justify these definitions
by considering their limits as the total angular momentum and the total center
of mass of an isolated system. These expressions were derived from the
Hamilton-Jacobi analysis of gravitation action and thus satisfy conservation
laws. As a result, we obtained an invariant total angular momentum theorem in
the Kerr spacetime. For a vacuum asymptotically flat initial data set of order
$1$, it is shown that the limits are always finite without any extra
assumptions. We also study these total conserved quantities on a family of
asymptotically flat initial data sets evolving by the vacuum Einstein evolution
equation. It is shown that the total angular momentum is conserved under the
evolution. For the total center of mass, the classical dynamical formula
relating the center of mass, energy, and linear momentum is recovered, in the
nonlinear context of initial data sets evolving by the vacuum Einstein
evolution equation. The definition of quasi-local angular momentum provides an
answer to the second problem in classical general relativity on Penrose's list

toroidal Bose-Einstein condensate is stirred by a rotating (optical) barrier of
variable height. When the barrier height is on the order of or greater than
half of the chemical potential, the critical barrier velocity at which we
observe a change in the circulation state is much less than the speed for sound
to propagate around the ring. In this regime we primarily observe discrete
jumps (phase slips) from the non-circulating initial state to a simple,
well-defined, persistent current state. For lower barrier heights, the critical
barrier velocity at which we observe a change in the circulation state is
higher, and approaches the effective sound speed for vanishing barrier height.
The response of the condensate in this small-barrier regime is more complex,
with vortex cores appearing in the bulk of the condensate. We find that the
variation of the excitation threshold with barrier height is in qualitative
agreement with the predictions of an effective 1D hydrodynamic model.

results indicate that small PBHs with initial masses between $10^{-4}$ to

seeds. On the other hand, PBHs formed at $t\sim 1s$ with initial mass between
900 and $\sim 980M_{\odot}$, by the time $t\sim 100s$ show masses of $10^4$ to
$10^6M_{\odot}$ which are masses of seeds or already formed SMBHs. The fact
that we consider only radial flow implies that our results work well as

commonly assumed that the report message for communicating the bandwidth
demands of the distributed optical network units (ONUs) to the central optical

after the ONU's payload data transmissions. In this article, we conduct a
detailed investigation of the impact of the report message scheduling (RMS),
either at the beginning (i.e., before the pay load data) or the end of an ONU
upstream transmission on PON performance. We analytically characterize the
reduction in channel idle time with reporting at the beginning of an upstream

experiments consider both the Ethernet Passive Optical Networking (EPON)
standard and the Gigabit PON (GPON) standard. We find that for DBAs with
offline sizing and scheduling of ONU upstream transmission grants at the end of
a polling cycle, which processes requests from all ONUs, reporting at the
beginning gives substantial reductions of mean packet delay at high loads. For
high-performing DBAs with online grant sizing and scheduling, which immediately
processes individual ONU requests, or interleaving of ONUs groups, both
reporting at the beginning or end give essentially the same average packet
delays.

are reported for layered compounds of the type Na3-xMIr2O6 and Na3-xM2IrO6,
where M is a transition metal from the 3d series (M=Zn, Cu, Ni, Co, Fe and Mn).
The rhombohedral structures, in space group R-3m, were determined by refinement
of neutron and synchrotron powder diffraction data. No clear evidence for long
range 2:1 or 1:2 honeycomb-like M/Ir ordering was found in the neutron powder
diffraction patterns except in the case of M = Zn, thus in general the
compounds are best designated as sodium deficient {\alpha}-NaFeO2-type phases
with formulas Na1-xM1/3Ir2/3O2 or Na1-xM2/3Ir1/3O2. Synchrotron powder
diffraction patterns indicate that several of the compounds likely have
honeycomb in-plane metal-iridium ordering with disordered stacking of the
layers. All the compounds are sodium deficient under our synthetic conditions
and are black and insulating. Weiss constants derived from magnetic
susceptibility measurements indicate that Na0.62Mn0.61Ir0.39O2,
Na0.80Fe2/3Ir1/3O2, Na0.92Ni1/3Ir2/3O2, Na0.86Cu1/3Ir2/3O2, and
Na0.89Zn1/3Ir2/3O2 display dominant antiferromagnetic interactions. For
Na0.90Co1/3Ir2/3O2 the dominant magnetic interactions at low temperature are
ferromagnetic while at high temperatures they are antiferromagnetic; there is
also a change in the effective moment. Low temperature specific heat
measurements (to 2 K) on Na0.92Ni1/3Ir2/3O2 indicate the presence of a broad
magnetic ordering transition. X-ray absorption spectroscopy shows that iridium
is at or close to the 4+ oxidation state in all compounds. 23Na nuclear
magnetic resonance measurements comparing Na2IrO3 to Na0.92Ni1/3Ir2/3O2 and
Na0.89Zn1/3Ir2/3O2 provide strong indications that the electron spins are
short-range ordered in the latter two materials. All of the compounds are spin
glasses.

dynamically decoupling a system from its environment has been extensively
studied in a variety of physical systems. When applied to dipolar solids,
recent experiments have demonstrated that CPMG pulse trains can generate
long-lived spin echoes. While there still remains some controversy as to the
origins of these long-lived spin echoes under the CPMG sequence, there is a
general agreement that pulse errors during the $\pi-$pulses are a necessary
requirement. In this work, we develop a theory to describe the spin dynamics in
dipolar coupled spin-1/2 system under a CPMG($\phi_{1},\phi_{2}$) pulse train,
where $\phi_{1}$ and $\phi_{2}$ are the phases of the $\pi-$pulses. From our
theoretical framework, the propagator for the CPMG($\phi_{1},\phi_{2}$) pulse
train is equivalent to an effective ``pulsed'' spin-locking of single-quantum
coherences with phase $\pm\frac{\phi_{2}-3\phi_{1}}{2}$, which generates a
periodic quasiequilibrium that corresponds to the long-lived echoes. Numerical
simulations, along with experiments on both magnetically dilute, random spin
networks found in C$_{60}$ and C$_{70}$ and in non-dilute spin systems found in
adamantane and ferrocene, were performed and confirm the predictions from the
proposed theory.

Autodock Vina software, which is a widely used for molecular docking software.
Autodock Vina already exploits Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP) in

with the results we have obtained, it can be clearly seen that our approach has
enhanced the throughput of the already optimized software by more than six

(CSI) that includes large-scale fading coefficients (LSFCs) and small-scale
fading coefficients (SSFCs) by uplink pilots. Although information about the
former FCs are indispensable in a MU-MIMO or distributed MIMO system, they are
usually ignored or assumed perfectly known when treating the MIMO CSI

With estimated LSFCs, SSFCs are then obtained using a rank-reduced (RR) channel

there is still no unique theoretical model for neutron stars (NSs). It is
therefore surprising that universal EOS-independent relations connecting
different physical quantities of neutron stars can exist. Lau et al. [ApJ, 714,

and the moment of inertia are connected by universal relations. More recently,
Yagi and Yunes [Science, 341, 365 (2013)] discovered the I-Love-Q universal
relations among the mass, the moment of inertia, the Love number, and the
quadrupole moment. In this paper, we study these universal relations in the
Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) gravity. This theory differs from general
relativity (GR) significantly only at high densities due to the nonlinear
coupling between matter and gravity. It thus provides us an ideal case to test
how robust the universal relations of NSs are with respect to the change of the
gravity theory. Thanks to the apparent EOS formulation of EiBI gravity
developed recently by Delsate and Steinhoff [Phys. Rev. Lett., 109, 021101

same techniques as those in GR. We find that the universal relations in EiBI
gravity are essentially the same as those in GR. Our work shows that, within
the currently viable coupling constant, there exists at least one modified
gravity theory that is indistinguishable from GR in view of the unexpected

in any one of the family of R\'enyi entropies $S_\alpha$, with $0< \alpha <

quantum control even for this simple problem. We generalize Jacobs' original
argument, which was for (the unique) impurity measure with a linear evolution
map under his protocol, by replacing linearity with convexity, thereby making
it applicable to R\'enyi entropies $S_\alpha$ for $\alpha$ in a finite interval
about $1$. Even with this generalization, Jacobs' argument fails to identify
the surprising fact, which we prove by Bellman's principle of dynamic
programming, that his protocol is globally optimal for all R\'enyi entropies
whose decrease is locally maximized by that protocol. Also surprisingly, even
though there is a range of R\'enyi entropies whose decrease is always locally
maximized by the null-control protocol, that null-control protocol cannot be
shown to be globally optimal in any instance. These results highlight the
non-intuitive relation between local and global optimality in stochastic

spindown. The effect of particle acceleration is included in modeling the
rotational energy loss rate of the neutron star. Applying the pulsar wind model
to the three intermittent pulsars (PSR B1931+24, PSR J1841-0500, and PSR
J1832+0029), their magnetic field and inclination angle are calculated
simultaneously. The theoretical braking indices of intermittent pulsars are
also given. In the pulsar wind model, the density of the particle wind can
always be the Goldreich-Julian density. This may ensure that different on
states of intermittent pulsars are stable. The duty cycle of particle wind can
be determined from timing observations. It is consistent with the duty cycle of
the on state. Inclination angle and braking index observations of intermittent
pulsars may help to test different models of particle acceleration. At present,
the inverse Compton scattering induced space charge limited flow with field

surface charge doping of the magnetic layer, a number of key experiments cannot

rise to a Rashba spin-orbit coupling which leads to a spin-splitting of the
conduction electrons. For a magnet, this splitting is modified by the exchange
field resulting in a large magnetic anisotropy energy via the

from standard candles in addition to redshifts, can provide strong constraints
on the linear growth rate of cosmological large-scale structure at low
redshift. The improvement originates from the physical relationship between
galaxy density and peculiar velocity, which substantially reduces cosmic
variance. We present the results of Fisher matrix forecasts of correlated
fields of galaxy density and velocity. Peculiar velocity can improve the growth
rate constraints by about a factor of two compared to density alone, if we can
use all the information for wavenumber k < 0.2 h/Mpc. Future peculiar velocity
surveys, TAIPAN, and the all-sky HI surveys, WALLABY and WNSHS, can measure the
growth rate, f*sigma8 to 3 per cent at z ~ 0.025. Although the velocity
subsample is about an order of magnitude smaller than the redshift sample from
the same survey, it improves the constraint by 40 per cent compared to the same
survey without velocity measurements. Peculiar velocity surveys can also
measure the growth rate as a function of wavenumber with 15-30 per cent
uncertainties in bins with widths 0.01 h/Mpc in the range 0.02 h/Mpc < k < 0.1
h/Mpc, which is a large improvement over galaxy density only. Such measurements
on very large scales can detect signatures of modified gravity or
non-Gaussianity through scale-dependent growth rate or galaxy bias. We use
N-body simulations to improve the modelling of auto- and cross-power spectra of
galaxy density and peculiar velocity by introducing a new redshift-space
distortion term to the velocity, which has been neglected in previous studies.
The velocity power spectrum has a damping in redshift space, which is larger
than that naively expected from the similar effect in the galaxy power
spectrum.

First, the $\Omega(N^{1/3})$ lower bound only applies when the range is no

apply to $r$-to-1 functions, which are quite different from random functions.
Understanding the collision problem for random functions is of great importance

that end, we prove that, as expected, a quantum query complexity of
$\Theta(N^{1/3})$ holds for all interesting domain and range sizes. Our proofs
are simple, and combine existing techniques with several novel tricks to obtain
the desired results. Using our techniques, we also give an optimal

the well-motivated updates, as referred to the practical updates, compared to
the naive updates. However, no serious analysis has been provided to understand
the updates and therefore the convergence rates. In the paper, we bridge the
gap by providing a theoretical analysis of the convergence rates of the
practical DisDCA algorithm. Our analysis helped by empirical studies has shown
that it could yield an exponential speed-up in the convergence by increasing
the number of dual updates at each iteration. This result justifies the
superior performances of the practical DisDCA as compared to the naive variant.
As a byproduct, our analysis also reveals the convergence behavior of the
one-communication DisDCA.

$\chi_{\rm s}$ is suppressed near the superfluid phase transition temperature
$T_{\rm c}$ due to strong pairing fluctuations. To characterize this anomalous

at which $\chi_{\rm s}$ takes a maximum value. Determining $T_{\rm s}$ in the

the pseudogap phenomenon appearing in the single-particle density of states.

achieves any value between [0,1] for the Symbols transmitted per Antenna per
Channel use (SpAC). FIA was designed in [1] specifically for Finite Alphabet
(FA) signals, under the constraint that the Minimum Distance (MD) detector is
used at all the receivers. Similar to classical interference alignment, the FIA
precoder also needs perfect channel state information at all the transmitters
(CSIT). In this work, a novel Blind Fractional Interference Alignment (B-FIA)
scheme is introduced, where the basic assumption is that CSIT is not available.
We consider two popular channel models, namely: Broadcast channel, and
Interference channel. For these two channel models, the maximum achievable
value of SpAC satisfying the constraints of the MD detector is obtained, but
with no CSIT, and also a precoder design is provided to obtain any value of
SpAC in the achievable range.
  Further, the precoder structure provided has one distinct advantage:
interference channel state information at the receiver (I-CSIR) is not needed,
when all the transmitters and receivers are equipped with one antenna each.
When two or more antennas are used at both ends, I-CSIR must be available to
obtain the maximum achievable value of SpAC. The receiver designs for both the
Minimum Distance and the Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoders are discussed, where
the interference statistics is estimated from the received signal samples.
Simulation results of the B-FIA show that the ML decoder with estimated
statistics achieves a significantly better error rate performance when compared
to the MD decoder with known statistics, since the MD decoder assumes the
interference plus noise term as colored Gaussian noise.

unexplained puzzling features of the THSR wave function, namely that after

function is almost 100$\%$ equivalent to an oblate THSR wave function is
clarified. It is shown that the true intrinsic two-cluster THSR configuration

fact that typical cluster systems, 2$\alpha$, 3$\alpha$, and $\alpha$+$^{16}$O,

case of linear-chain states with two and three $\alpha$-clusters as well as for

only the thing in mind that from different solar system constrains it must be
greater than $5\times 10^{5}$. Once we have a value, satisfying the required
lower boundary, in our hand we proceed for setting unknown parameters of the
different dark energy models' EoS parameter. In this paper we work with three
well known red shift parametrizations of dark energy EoS. To constrain their
free parameters for Brans Dicke theory of gravity we take twelve point red
shift vs Hubble's parameter data and perform $\chi^{2}$ test. We present the
observational data analysis mechanism for Stern, Stern+BAO and Stern+BAO+CMB
observations. Minimising $\chi^2$, we obtain the best fit values and draw
different confidence contours. We analyze the contours physically. Also we
examine the best fit of distance modulus for our theoretical models and the
Supernovae Type Ia Union2 sample. For Brans Dicke theory of gravity the
difference from the mainstream confidence contouring method of data analysis id
that the confidence contours evolved are not at all closed contours like a
circle or a ellipse. Rather they are found to be open contours allowing the
free parameters to float inside a infinite region of parameter space. However,
negative EoSs are likely to evolve from the best fit values.

outputs a mixture that is $\varepsilon$-close in total variation distance, in

pseudo-polynomially in these parameters.
  One of our main contributions is an improved and generalized algorithm for
selecting a good candidate distribution from among competing hypotheses.
Namely, given a collection of $N$ hypotheses containing at least one candidate
that is $\varepsilon$-close to an unknown distribution, our algorithm outputs a
candidate which is $O(\varepsilon)$-close to the distribution. The algorithm
requires ${O}(\log{N}/\varepsilon^2)$ samples from the unknown distribution and
${O}(N \log N/\varepsilon^2)$ time, which improves previous such results (such
as the Scheff\'e estimator) from a quadratic dependence of the running time on
$N$ to quasilinear. Given the wide use of such results for the purpose of
hypothesis selection, our improved algorithm implies immediate improvements to
any such use.

more recently, Mid-Infrared (MIR) background light. It has been somewhat more
of a surprise to find that there are regions that appear as dark shadows at
Far-Infrared (FIR) wavelengths as long as $\sim$100$\mu m$. Here we develop
analysis methods of FIR images from Spitzer-MIPS and Herschel-PACS that allow
quantitative measurements of cloud mass surface density, $\Sigma$. The method
builds upon that developed for MIR extinction mapping (MIREX) (Butler and Tan
2012), in particular involving a search for independent saturated, i.e. very
opaque, regions that allow measurement of the foreground intensity. We focus on
three massive starless core/clumps in IRDC G028.37+00.07, deriving mass surface
density maps from 3.5 to 70$\mu m$. A by-product of this analysis is
measurement of the spectral energy distribution of the diffuse foreground
emission. The lower opacity at 70$\mu m$ allows us to probe to higher $\Sigma$
values, up to $\sim1\:{\rm{g\:cm}^{-2}}$ in the densest parts of the
core/clumps. Comparison of the $\Sigma$ maps at different wavelengths
constrains the shape of the MIR-FIR dust opacity law in IRDCs. We find it is
most consistent with the thick ice mantle models of Ossenkopf and Henning
(1994). There is tentative evidence for grain ice mantle growth as one goes
from lower to higher $\Sigma$ regions.

problems, or, more generally, variational inequalities with monotone operators,
are proximal type algorithms which at every iteration need to compute a
prox-mapping, that is, to minimize over problem's domain $X$ the sum of a
linear form and the specific convex distance-generating function underlying the
algorithms in question. Relative computational simplicity of prox-mappings,
which is the standard requirement when implementing proximal algorithms,
clearly implies the possibility to equip $X$ with a relatively computationally
cheap Linear Minimization Oracle (LMO) able to minimize over $X$ linear forms.
There are, however, important situations where a cheap LMO indeed is available,
but where no proximal setup with easy-to-compute prox-mappings is known. This
fact motivates our goal in this paper, which is to develop techniques for
solving variational inequalities with monotone operators on domains given by

an upper bound for the price of anarchy (i.e., the worst-case ratio of the

Keldysh Green's function formalism at zero temperature combined with the
self-consistent Born approximation. At early stage after dynamical hole doping,
the Drude component appears, and then incoherent components originating from
hole-magnon scatterings start to grow. Fast oscillatory behavior due to
coherent magnon, and slow relaxation dynamics are confirmed in the spectra.
Time profiles are interpreted as that doped bare holes are dressed by magnon
clouds, and are relaxed into spin polaron quasi-particle states. Characteristic
relaxation times for Drude and incoherent peaks strongly depend on momentum of
a dynamically doped hole, and the exchange constant. Implications to the recent

asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars provide predictions of elemental abundances
and yields for comparison to observations. However, there are many
uncertainties that reduce the accuracy of these predictions. One such
uncertainty involves the treatment of low-temperature molecular opacities that
account for the surface abundance variations of C, N, and O. A number of prior
calculations of intermediate-mass AGB stellar models that incorporate both
efficient third dredge-up and hot bottom burning include a molecular opacity
treatment which does not consider the depletion of C and O due to hot bottom
burning. Here we update the molecular opacity treatment and investigate the
effect of this improvement on calculations of intermediate-mass AGB stellar
models. We perform tests on two masses, 5 M$_{\odot}$ and 6 M$_{\odot}$, and
two metallicities, $Z~=~0.001$ and $Z~=~0.02$, to quantify the variations
between two opacity treatments. We find that several evolutionary properties
(e.g. radius, $T_{\rm eff}$ and $T_{\rm bce}$) are dependent on the opacity
treatment. Larger structural differences occur for the $Z~=~0.001$ models
compared to the $Z~=~0.02$ models indicating that the opacity treatment has a
more significant effect at lower metallicity. As a consequence of the
structural changes, the predictions of isotopic yields are slightly affected
with most isotopes experiencing changes up to 60 per cent for the $Z~=~0.001$
models and 20 per cent for the $Z~=~0.02$ models. Despite this moderate effect,
we conclude that it is more fitting to use variable molecular opacities for
models undergoing hot bottom burning.

various surveys and observed in the FIR. We have interpreted the available data
by means of chemical evolution models for forming proto-spheroids,
investigating the role of the major parameters regulating star formation and
dust production. For a few systems, given the derived small dynamical masses,
the observed dust content can be explained only assuming a top-heavy initial
mass function, an enhanced star formation efficiency and an increased rate of
dust accretion. However, the possibility that, for some systems, the dynamical
mass has been underestimated cannot be excluded. If this were the case, the
dust mass can be accounted for by standard model assumptions. We provide
predictions regarding the abundance of the descendants of QSO hosts; albeit
rare, such systems should be present and detectable by future deep surveys such

phenomena such as galaxy formation and evolution, fueling of supermassive black
holes in galaxies and the consequent (negative and positive) feedback
phenomena, and the origin of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters.
In numerical simulations the calculation of the mass return can be time
consuming, since it requires at each time step the evaluation of a convolution
integral over the whole star formation history, so the computational time
increases quadratically with the number of time-steps. The situation can be
especially critical in hydrodynamical simulations, where different grid points
are characterized by different star formation histories, and the gas cooling
and heating times are shorter by orders of magnitude than the characteristic
stellar lifetimes. In this paper we present a fast and accurate method to
compute the mass return from stellar populations undergoing arbitrarily
complicated star formation histories. At each time-step the mass return is
calculated from its value at the previous time, and the star formation rate
over the last time-step only. Therefore in the new scheme there is no need to
store the whole star formation history, and the computational time increases
linearly with the number of time-steps.

down of these relaxation processes are compared with observations in fragile
supercooled liquids by establishing a one-to-one mapping between the waiting
time since filtration of a Laponite suspension and the inverse of the
temperature of a supercooled liquid that is rapidly quenched towards its glass
transition temperature. New timescales, such as the Vogel time and the Kauzmann
time, are extracted to describe the phenomenon of dynamical arrest in Laponite
suspensions. In results that are strongly reminiscent of those extracted from
supercooled liquids approaching their glass transitions, it is demonstrated
that the Vogel time calculated for each Laponite concentration is approximately
equal to the Kauzmann time, and that a strong coupling exists between the
primary and secondary relaxation processes of aging Laponite suspensions.
Furthermore, the experimental data presented here clearly demonstrates the
self-similar nature of the aging dynamics of Laponite suspensions within a

Cycle 24 have drawn attention to the challenges involved in predicting solar

about the starting time and rise time as well as the shape and amplitude of the
cycle. With this tutorial, we investigate the variations in the length of the
sunspot number cycle and examine whether the variability can be explained in
terms of a secular pattern. We identified long-term cycles in archival data
from 1610 - 2000 using median trace analyses of the cycle length and power
spectrum analyses of the (O-C) residuals of the dates of sunspot minima and
maxima. Median trace analyses of data spanning 385 years indicate a cycle
length with a period of 183 - 243 years, and a power spectrum analysis
identifies a period of 188 $\pm$ 38 years. We also find a correspondence
between the times of historic minima and the length of the sunspot cycle, such
that the cycle length increases during the time when the number of spots is at
a minimum. In particular, the cycle length was growing during the Maunder
Minimum when almost no sunspots were visible on the Sun. Our study suggests
that the length of the sunspot number cycle should increase gradually, on
average, over the next $\sim$75 years, accompanied by a gradual decrease in the
number of sunspots. This information should be considered in cycle prediction
models to provide better estimates of the starting time of each cycle.

often gives better approximation of the function than truncating its Taylor
series, and it may still work where the Taylor series does not converge. In the
present work, we consider the Pad\'e approximant in two issues. First, we
obtain the analytical approximation of the luminosity distance for the flat
XCDM model, and find that the relative error is fairly small. Second, we
propose several parameterizations for the equation-of-state parameter (EoS) of
dark energy based on the Pad\'e approximant. They are well motivated from the
mathematical and physical points of view. We confront these EoS
parameterizations with the latest observational data, and find that they can

The
system of equations describing radial motions of this sphere in Lagrangian
variables reduces to the only nonlinear PDE of the second order in both
variables (Lagrangian coordinate and time). The linearization of this PDE leads
to the well-known Eddington's equation of the standard model. The case of no
energy exchange between the polytrope and the outer medium is considered, that
is, polytrope's motions are adiabatic. If gamma (a ratio of the specific heats
of the gas) is 4/3 than PDE obtained allows the separation of variables. There
exist two types of solutions of the problem both describing limitless expansion
without shock wave formation. The first one is an expansion with positive total
energy, and the second one is an expansion with zero total energy. The second
solution is of an astrophysical interest. It describes the permanently
retarding expansion that, perhaps, is akin to a born of a red giant. The
stellar density in this case concentrates to the centre of the star stronger
than the density of the stationary star with the same gamma.

types. Longo, Milstead and Soloviev proposed to capture the inability of
generic programs to probe the structure of their instances by the following
equational principle: if two generic programs, viewed as terms of type $\forall
X. \, A[X]$, are equal at any given instance $A[T]$, then they are equal at all
instances. They proved that this rule is admissible in a certain extension of
System F, but finding a semantically motivated model satisfying this principle
remained an open problem.
  In the present paper, we construct a categorical model of polymorphism, based
on game semantics, which contains a large collection of generic types. This
model builds on two novel constructions:
  -- A direct interpretation of variable types as games, with a natural notion
of substitution of games. This allows moves in games A[T] to be decomposed into
the generic part from A, and the part pertaining to the instance T. This leads
to a simple and natural notion of generic strategy.
  -- A ""relative polymorphic product"" which expresses quantification over the
type variable X in the variable type A with respect to a ""universe'"" which is
explicitly given as an additional parameter B. We then solve a recursive
equation involving this relative product to obtain a universe in a suitably
""absolute"" sense.
  Full Completeness for ML types (universal closures of quantifier-free types)
is proved for this model.

process. The explanation of the relationship between model variables and

thanks to the availability of model parameters and their statistical
significance. For ""black box"" models, such as random forest, this information
is hidden inside the model structure. This work presents an approach for
computing feature contributions for random forest classification models. It
allows for the determination of the influence of each variable on the model
prediction for an individual instance. By analysing feature contributions for a
training dataset, the most significant variables can be determined and their
typical contribution towards predictions made for individual classes, i.e.,
class-specific feature contribution ""patterns"", are discovered. These patterns
represent a standard behaviour of the model and allow for an additional
assessment of the model reliability for a new data. Interpretation of feature
contributions for two UCI benchmark datasets shows the potential of the
proposed methodology. The robustness of results is demonstrated through an
extensive analysis of feature contributions calculated for a large number of

the broken/restored chiral symmetry, and confinement/deconfinement regions.
This structure is represented by the projection of the order parameters in the
temperature-chemical potential plane, which allows a clear identification of
pattern changes in the phase diagram. Such a criterium also enables the
emergence of a quarkyonic phase even in the two-flavor system. We still show
that this new phase diminishes due to the influence of an additional
vector-type interaction in the PNJL phase diagrams, and is quite sensitive to
the effect of the change of the $T_0$ parameter in the Polyakov potential.
Finally, we show that the phases and boundaries constructed by our method
indicate that the order parameters should be more strongly correlated, as in
the case of entanglement PNJL (EPNJL) model. This result suggests a novel way
to pursue further investigation of new interactions between the order

channel vectors of its multicast users. Moreover, the optimal combining

timedivision duplex systems. We propose a new pilot scheme that estimates the
composite channel which is a linear combination of the individual channels of
multicast users in each cell. This scheme is able to completely eliminate pilot
contamination. The pilot power control for optimizing the multicast beamformer

orthogonal transforms decouple symmetric-alpha-stable (S$\alpha$S) AR(1)

$0<\alpha<2$ yields processes with sparse linear-prediction error. In the
presence of sparsity, we show that operator-like wavelet bases do outperform
the sinusoidal ones. Also, we observe that, for processes with very sparse
increments ($0<\alpha\leq 1$), the operator-like wavelet basis is
indistinguishable from the ICA solution obtained through numerical
optimization. We consider two criteria for independence. The first is the
Kullback-Leibler divergence between the joint probability density function
(pdf) of the original signal and the product of the marginals in the
transformed domain. The second is a divergence between the joint pdf of the
original signal and the product of the marginals in the transformed domain,
which is based on Stein's formula for the mean-square estimation error in
additive Gaussian noise. Our framework then offers a unified view that
encompasses the discrete cosine transform (known to be asymptotically optimal

just an auxiliary field in the Jordan frame of the Starobinsky model and this
leads to two important consequences: first, the inflationary predictions of the
Starobinsky model and its descendants are slightly different (albeit not
measurably); secondly the theories have different small-field behaviour,
leading to different ultra-violet cut-off scales. In particular, one
interesting descendant of the Starobinsky model is the non-minimally- coupled

more severe and CFT is recovered only asymptotically. Furthermore, we provide
evidence that their exponent is the same as that governing the corrections of

of our galaxy and the galaxy M87, ray-tracing methods are applied to both
standard General Relativity (GR) and a recently proposed extension, the
pseudo-complex General Relativity (pc-GR). The correction terms due to the
investigated pc-GR model lead to slower orbital motions close to massive
objects. Also the concept of an innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) is
modified for the pc-GR model, allowing particles to get closer to the central
object for most values of the spin parameter $a$ than in GR. Thus, the
accretion disk, surrounding a massive object, is brighter in pc-GR than in GR.
Iron K$\alpha$ emission line profiles are also calculated as those are good
observables for regions of strong gravity. Differences between the two theories
are pointed out.

of optimal convergence rates for adaptive finite element methods and second at
some refinements of particular questions like the avoidance of (discrete) lower
bounds, inexact solvers, inhomogeneous boundary data, or the use of equivalent
error estimators. Solely four axioms guarantee the optimality in terms of the
error estimators.
  Compared to the state of the art in the temporary literature, the
improvements of this article can be summarized as follows: First, a general
framework is presented which covers the existing literature on optimality of
adaptive schemes. The abstract analysis covers linear as well as nonlinear
problems and is independent of the underlying finite element or boundary
element method. Second, efficiency of the error estimator is neither needed to
prove convergence nor quasi-optimal convergence behavior of the error
estimator. In this paper, efficiency exclusively characterizes the
approximation classes involved in terms of the best-approximation error and
data resolution and so the upper bound on the optimal marking parameters does
not depend on the efficiency constant. Third, some general quasi-Galerkin
orthogonality is not only sufficient, but also necessary for the $R$-linear
convergence of the error estimator, which is a fundamental ingredient in the
current quasi-optimality analysis due to Stevenson 2007. Finally, the general
analysis allows for equivalent error estimators and inexact solvers as well as
different non-homogeneous and mixed boundary conditions.

  It is known that $G$ is a proper circular-arc graph exactly when its closed

connectedness properties of $N[G]$ and prove that, if $G$ is a connected,
twin-free, proper circular-arc graph with non-bipartite complement, then $N[G]$

the redshift range z ~ 2-6 the median stellar mass of the most luminous
(sub-)mm sources is M_* ~ 3 * 10^11 M_odot, yielding a typical specific
star-formation rate sSFR ~ 3 Gyr^-1. Consistent with recent ALMA and SMA
studies, we confirm that source blending is not a serious issue in the study of
luminous (sub-)mm sources uncovered by ground-based, single-dish surveys; only
~ 10-15% of bright (S_850 ~ 5 - 10 mJy) (sub-)mm sources arise from significant

adopt the original single-dish mm/sub-mm flux-densities/positions, or the
interferometric data. Our results suggest that apparent disagreements over the
redshift distribution of (sub-)mm sources are a result of ""down-sizing"" in
dust-enshrouded star-formation, consistent with existing knowledge of the
star-formation histories of massive galaxies. They also indicate that extreme
star-forming galaxies at high redshift are, on average, subject to the same
star-formation rate-limiting processes as less luminous objects, and lie on the

the contribution from the inflationary origin. In a possible scenario, matter
(dark or baryonic) and radiation etc. can emerge from a single Higgs-like
tachyonic scalar field in the universe through a physical mechanism not yet

thermodynamical equilibrium in the evolution of the universe. The field
potential for the present acceleration of the universe would give a boost to
the amplitude of the tensor fluctuations of gravity waves generated by the
early inflation and the net effects may be higher than the earlier PLANCK

creation of dark matter. The diagnostics for the three-component, spatially

inputs at a simple T-junction we were able to reproducibly control the path
taken by the plasmodium of P. Polycephalum. Where the chemoattractant farnesene
was used at one input a routed signal could be reproducibly generated i.e. P.
Polycephalum moves towards the source of chemoattractant. Where the
chemoattractant was applied at both inputs the signal was reproducibly split.
If a chemorepellent was used then the signal was reproducibly suppressed. If no
chemical input was used in the simple circuit then a random signal was
generated, whereby P. Polycephalum would move towards one output at the
junction, but the direction was randomly selected. We extended this study to a
more complex series of T-junctions to explore further the potential of routing
P. Polycephalum. Although many of the circuits were completed effectively, any
errors from the implementation of the simple T-junction were magnified. There
were also issues with cascading effects through multiple junctions. For example
signal splitting could be reproducibly initiated at the first junction but not
at subsequent junctions. This work highlights the potential for exploiting
chemotaxis to achieve complex and reliable routing of P. Polycephalum signals.
This may be useful in implementing computing algorithms, design of autonomous
robots and directed material synthesis. In additional experiments we showed
that the application of chemoattractant compounds at specific locations on a

elements. This paper presents a study of all co-spherical elements that appear
while tessellating a 1-irregular cuboid (cuboid with at most one Steiner point
on its edges) with different aspect ratio. Steiner points can be located at any
position between the edge endpoints. When Steiner points are located at edge
midpoints, 24 co-spherical elements appear while tessellating 1-irregular
cubes. By inserting internal faces and edges to these new elements, this number
is reduced to 13. When 1-irregular cuboids with aspect ratio equal to
$\sqrt{2}$ are tessellated, 10 co-spherical elements are required. If
1-irregular cuboids have aspect ratio between 1 and $\sqrt{2}$, all the
tessellations are adequate for the finite volume method. When Steiner points
are located at any position, the study was done for a specific Steiner point
distribution on a cube. 38 co-spherical elements were required to tessellate
all the generated 1-irregular cubes. Statistics about the impact of each new
element in the tessellations of 1-irregular cuboids are also included. This
study was done by developing an algorithm that construct Delaunay tessellations

is due to the presence of a center --- a set of operators which commute with
all others --- in the gauge invariant operator algebra corresponding to finite
region. A unique entropy can be assigned to algebras with center, giving place
to a local entropy in lattice gauge theories. However, ambiguities arise on the
correspondence between algebras and regions. In particular, it is always
possible to choose (in many different ways) local algebras with trivial center,
and hence a genuine entanglement entropy, for any region. These choices are in
correspondence with maximal trees of links on the boundary, which can be
interpreted as partial gauge fixings. This interpretation entails a gauge
fixing dependence of the entanglement entropy. In the continuum limit however,
ambiguities in the entropy are given by terms local on the boundary of the

exchanged between two fundamental observers changes in proportion to expansion
of the space $D$ between them, so $\Delta\log(\lambda / D) = 0$. This is
exactly the same as for a pair of observers receding from each other in flat
space-time where the effect is purely kinematic. The interpretation of this has
been the subject of considerable debate, and it has been suggested that all
redshifts are a relative velocity effect, raising the question of whether the
wavelength always stretches in proportion to the emitter-receiver separation.
Here we show that, for low redshift at least, $\Delta\log(\lambda / D)$
vanishes for a photon exchanged between any two freely-falling observers in a
spatially constant tidal field, because such a field stretches wavelengths and
the space between the observers identically. But in general there is a
non-kinematic, and essentially gravitational, component of the redshift that is
given by a weighted average of the gradient of the tidal field along the photon
path. While the redshift can always be formally expressed using the Doppler
formula, in situations where the gravitational redshift dominates, the
`relative velocity' is typically quite different from the rate of change of $D$
and it is misleading to think of the redshift as being a velocity or
`kinematic' effect.

habitable conditions for metazoans and simpler life forms. However, identifying
the sources (comets, meteorites, and trapped nebular gas) that supplied
volatiles to Earth is not straightforward because secondary processes like
mantle degassing, crustal recycling, and escape to space modified the
composition of the atmosphere. Here, we review two complementary approaches to
investigate the origin of Earth's atmosphere and oceans. The geochemical
approach uses volatile element abundances and isotopic compositions to identify
the possible contributors to the atmosphere and to disentangle the processes
that shaped it. In that respect, noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe), elements
that are chemically inert and possess several isotopes produced by
radioactivity, play a critical role. The dynamical approach uses our knowledge
of planetary dynamics to track volatile delivery to the Earth, starting with
dust transport in the disk to planet-building processes. The main conclusion is
that Earth acquired most of its major volatile elements by accretion of
planetesimals or embryos akin to volatile-rich meteorites. At the same time,
solar/meteoritic noble gases were captured by embryos and some gases were lost
to space, by hydrodynamic escape and large impacts. Comets did not contribute
much H, C, and N but may have delivered significant noble gases, which could
represent the only fingerprints of the bombardment of our planet with icy
bodies. The processes that governed the delivery of volatile elements to the
Earth are thought to be relatively common and it is likely that Earth-like

long-range order, those with a magnetically disordered (cooperative quantum

some of the fundamental QCD Green's functions, whose origin can be traced back
to the nonperturbative masslessness of the ghost field, in the Landau gauge.
Specifically, the ghost loops that contribute to these Green's functions
display infrared divergences, akin to those encountered in the perturbative
treatment, in contradistinction to the gluonic loops, whose perturbative
divergences are tamed by the dynamical generation of an effective gluon mass.
In d=4, the aforementioned divergences are logarithmic, thus causing a
relatively mild impact, whereas in d=3 they are linear, giving rise to enhanced
effects. In the case of the gluon propagator, these effects do not interfere
with its finiteness, but make its first derivative diverge at the origin, and
introduce a maximum in the region of infrared momenta. The three-gluon vertex
is also affected, and the induced divergent behavior is clearly exposed in
certain special kinematic configurations, usually considered in lattice
simulations; the sign of the corresponding divergence is unambiguously
determined. The main underlying concepts are developed in the context of a
simple toy model, which demonstrates clearly the interconnected nature of the
various effects. The picture that emerges is subsequently corroborated by a
detailed nonperturbative analysis, combining lattice results with the dynamical
integral equations governing the relevant ingredients, such as the
nonperturbative ghost loop and the momentum-dependent gluon mass.

the same degree. Our main result in this paper is that this is indeed the case.
Specifically, we show that for any positive integer $k$, there is a constant
$C=C(k)$, so that given any graph $G$, one can remove from $G$ at most $C$
vertices and thus obtain a new graph $G'$ that contains at least
$\min\{k,|G|-C\}$ vertices of the same degree.
  Our main tool is a multidimensional zero-sum theorem for integer sequences,
which we prove using an old geometric approach of Alon and Berman.

chains moving under a Kramers metastable potential. Due to thermal noise, the
polymers, initially placed in the metastable well, can cross the potential
barrier, but these events are extremely rare if the barrier is much larger than
thermal energy. To speed up the slow rate processes in computer simulations, we
extend the recently proposed path integral hyperdynamics method to the cases of
polymers. We consider the cases where the polymers' radii of gyration are
comparable to the distance between the well bottom and the barrier top. We find
that, for a flexible polymer, the crossing rate ($\mathcal{R}$) monotonically
decreases with chain contour length ($L$), but with the magnitude much larger
than the Kramers rate in the globular limit. For a semiflexible polymer, the
crossing rate decreases with $L$ but becomes nearly constant for large $L$. For
a fixed $L$, the crossing rate becomes maximum at an intermediate bending
stiffness. For a self-avoiding chain, the rate is a nonmonotonic function of
$L$, first decreasing with $L$, and then, above certain length, increasing with
$L$. These findings can be instrumental for efficient separation of
biopolymers.

entanglement with surroundings. The former reflects the nonseparability between
a system and a classical environment as the latter for a quantum environment,
and the concept of geometric time-energy uncertainty can be adopted as a
signature of the nonseparability. Based on this viewpoint, we study their
relationship in the quantum-classical transition of the environment, with the
aid of a spin-half particle (qubit) model exposed to a quantum-classical hybrid
field. In the quantum-classical transition, the Berry phase has a similar
connection with the time-energy uncertainty as the case with only a classical
field, whereas the geometric phase for the mixed state of the qubit exhibits a
complementary relationship with the entanglement. Namely, for a fixed
time-energy uncertainty, the entanglement is gradually replaced by the mixed
geometric phase as the quantum field vanishes. And the mixed geometric phase
becomes the Berry phase in the classical limit. The same results can be draw
out from a displaced harmonic oscillator model.

framework of space weather forecasting. In-situ measurements of the background

derive the distribution of solar wind parameters in interplanetary space. We
test the performance of different solar wind models, namely Magnetohydrodynamic
Algorithm outside a Sphere/ENLIL (MAS/ENLIL), Wang-Sheeley-Arge/ENLIL

from spacecraft located at 1 AU distance to the Sun (ACE, Wind). To exclude the
influence of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs), we chose the year
2007 as a time period with low solar activity for our comparison. We found that
the general structure of the background solar wind is well reproduced by all
models. The best model results were obtained for the parameter solar wind
speed. However, the predicted arrival times of high-speed solar wind streams
have typical uncertainties of the order of about one day. Comparison of model
runs with synoptic magnetic maps from different observatories revealed that the

limitations may be overcome by introducing agile devices able, for example, to
simultaneously detect, process and emit a coherent signal. Such a pathway has
been explored with different approaches that bear advantages and drawbacks.
Polaritons have often been proposed as promising candidates for multifunctional
devices. Here we present an optical switch based on polariton lasing. An
incident monochromatic signal is channeled into several polariton laser beams

that the magnetic field direction is not consistent with the induced
magnetosphere produced by magnetic field lines draping. We arrive at the
conclusion that the mechanisms alternative to the induced magnetosphere
formation should be considered for the Titan magnetic surrounding.

sections of End(TMM) may be parallel for g. They form an associative algebra A,
which is also the commutant of the holonomy group of g. As any associative
algebra, A is the sum of its radical and of a semi-simple algebra S. Here we
study S: it may be of eight different types, including the generic type S=R.Id,
and the K\""ahler and hyperk\""ahler types 'S isomorphic to C' and 'S isomorphic
to the quaternions'. This is a result on real, semi-simple algebras with
involution. For each type, the corresponding set of germs of metrics is
non-empty; we parametrise it. We give the constraints imposed to the Ricci
curvature by parallel endomorphism fields

viscous star with spherical symmetry. Matching conditions are given for the
interior and exterior metrics. We use perturbation scheme to construct the
collapse equation. The range of instability is explored in Newtonian and post
Newtonian (pN) limits. We conclude that the electromagnetic field diminishes
the effects of shearing viscosity in the instability range and makes the system
more unstable at both Newtonian and post Newtonian approximations.

initial data frameworks; in spin foam models, it can be written as a
composition of elementary cellular amplitudes/propagators. We present a
framework for discrete spacetime classical field theory in which solutions to
the field equations over elementary spacetime cells may be amalgamated if they
satisfy simple gluing conditions matching the composition rules of cellular
amplitudes in spin foam models. Furthermore, the formalism is endowed with a
multisymplectic structure responsible for local conservation laws.
  Some models within our framework are effective theories modeling a system at
a given scale. Our framework allows us to study coarse graining and the
continuum limit.

These solutions provide closed-form expressions for the current-voltage

results from the CANDELS survey. These models are each applied to the same set
of halo merger trees extracted from the ""Bolshoi"" simulation and are carefully
tuned to match the local galaxy stellar mass function using the powerful method
of Bayesian Inference coupled with MCMC or by hand. The comparisons reveal that
in spite of the significantly different parameterizations for star formation
and feedback processes, the three models yield qualitatively similar
predictions for the assembly histories of galaxy stellar mass and star
formation over cosmic time. We show that the SAMs generally require strong
outflows to suppress star formation in low-mass halos to match the present day
stellar mass function. However, all of the models considered produce
predictions for the star formation rates and metallicities of low-mass galaxies
that are inconsistent with existing data and diverge between the models. We
suggest that large differences in the metallicity relations and small
differences in the stellar mass assembly histories of model galaxies stem from
different assumptions for the outflow mass-loading factor. Importantly, while
more accurate observational measurements for stellar mass, SFR and metallicity
of galaxies at 1<z<5 will discriminate between models, the discrepancies
between the models and existing data of these observables have already revealed
challenging problems in understanding star formation and its feedback in galaxy
formation. The three sets of models are being used to construct catalogs of
mock galaxies on light cones that have the same geometry as the CANDELS survey,
which should be particularly useful for quantifying the biases and
uncertainties on measurements and inferences from the real observations.

variations among image windows. The dimensions of AE space tend to correspond
to aspects of window appearance (e.g. side view, close up, background). We
model the overlap of a window with an object using Gaussian Processes (GP)
regression, which spreads annotation smoothly through AE space. The
probabilistic nature of GP allows our method to perform self-assessment, i.e.
assigning a quality estimate to its own output. It enables trading off the
amount of returned annotations for their quality. A large scale experiment on
219 classes and 0.5 million images demonstrates that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods and baselines for both object localization and

to be mid-to-late M dwarfs. We fit an astrometric model to MEarth's images for
1507 stars and obtained trigonometric distance measurements to each star with
an average precision of 5 milliarcseconds. Our measurements, combined with the
2MASS photometry, allowed us to obtain an absolute K_s magnitude for each star.
In turn, this allows us to better estimate the stellar parameters than those
obtained with photometric estimates alone and to better prioritize the targets
chosen to monitor at high cadence for planetary transits. The MEarth sample is
mostly complete out to a distance of 25 parsecs for stars of type M5.5V and
earlier, and mostly complete for later type stars out to 20 parsecs. We find
eight stars that are within ten parsecs of the Sun for which there did not
exist a published trigonometric parallax distance estimate. We release with
this work a catalog of the trigonometric parallax measurements for 1,507
mid-to-late M-dwarfs, as well as new estimates of their masses and radii.

hypothesis that some application stores have a greater density of malicious

applications used on a device can serve as an indicator for infection of that
device. Our analysis indicates that this alone is not an accurate indicator for
pinpointing infection. However, it is a very inexpensive but surprisingly
useful way for significantly narrowing down the pool of devices on which
expensive monitoring and analysis mechanisms must be deployed. Using our two
malware datasets we show that this indicator performs 4.8 and 4.6 times
(respectively) better at identifying infected devices than the baseline of
random checks. Such indicators can be used, for example, in the search for new
or previously undetected malware. It is therefore a technique that can
complement standard malware scanning by anti-malware tools. Our analysis also
demonstrates a marginally significant difference in battery use between

connected to a thermodynamic description in the boundary of that region,
thereby providing clear physical interpretations of several mathematical
features of classical general relativity: (1) The Noether charge contained in a
bulk region, associated with a specific time evolution vector field, has a
direct thermodynamic interpretation as the gravitational heat content of the
boundary surface. (2) This result, in turn, shows that all static spacetimes
maintain holographic equipartition; in these spacetimes, the number of degrees
of freedom in the boundary is equal to the number of degrees of freedom in the
bulk. (3) In a general, evolving spacetime, the rate of change of gravitational
momentum is related to the difference between the number of bulk and boundary
degrees of freedom. It is this departure from the holographic equipartition
which drives the time evolution of the spacetime. (4) When the equations of
motion hold, the (naturally defined) total energy of the gravity plus matter
within a bulk region, will be equal to the boundary heat content. (5) After
motivating the need for an alternate description of gravity (if we have to
solve the cosmological constant problem), I describe a thermodynamic
variational principle based on null surfaces to achieve this goal. The concept
of gravitational heat density of the null surfaces arises naturally from the
Noether charge associated with the null congruence. The null surface
variational principle, in fact, extremises the total heat content of the matter
plus gravity system. Several variations on this theme and implications are
described. [Abridged]

direct application of the Lorentz law of classical electro-dynamics. The
derivation is straightforward in the case of solid metals and solid
dielectrics, where the mass density and the optical constants of the media are
assumed to remain unchanged under internal and external pressures, and where
material flow and deformation can be ignored. For metallic mirrors, we separate
the contribution to the radiation pressure of the electrical charge density
from that of the current density of the conduction electrons. In the case of
dielectric media, we examine the forces experienced by bound charges and
currents, and determine the contribution of each to the radiation pressure.
These analyses reveal the existence of a lateral radiation pressure inside the
dielectric media, one that is exerted at and around the edges of a
finite-diameter light beam. The lateral pressure turns out to be compressive
for s-polarized light and expansive for p-polarized light. Along the way, we
derive an expression for the momentum density of the light field inside
dielectric media, one that has equal contributions from the traditional
Minkowski and Abraham forms. This new expression for the momentum density,
which contains both electromagnetic and mechanical terms, is used to explain
the behavior of light pulses and individual photons upon entering and exiting a
dielectric slab. In all the cases considered, the net forces and torques
experienced by material bodies are consistent with the relevant conservation
laws. Our method of calculating the radiation pressure can be used in
conjunction with numerical simulations to yield the distribution of fields and

sites within the human genome. These common variants often locally correlate
into more complex multi-SNP haploblocks that are maintained throughout
generations in a stable population. The information encoded in the structure of
common SNPs and SNP haploblock variation can be characterized through a
normalized information content (NIC) metric. Such an intrinsic measure allows
disparate regions of individual genomes and the genomes of various populations
to be quantitatively compared in a meaningful way.
  Using our defined measures of genomic information, the interplay of
maintained statistical variations due to the environmental baths within which
stable populations exist can be interrogated. We develop the analogous
""thermodynamics"" characterizing the state variables for genomic populations
that are stable under stochastic environmental stresses. Since living systems
have not been found to develop in the absence of environmental influences, we
focus on describing the analogous genomic free energy measures in this
development.
  The intensive parameter describing how an environment drives genomic
diversity is found to depend inversely upon the NIC of the genome of a stable
population within that environment. Once this environmental potential has been
determined from the whole genome of a population, additive state variables can
be directly related to the probabilities of the occurrence of given viable SNP
based units (alleles) within that genome. This formulation allows the
determination of both population averaged state variables as well as the
genomic energies of individual alleles and their combinations. The
determination of individual allelic potentials then should allow the
parameterization of specific environmental influences upon shared alleles
across populations in varying environments.

this expansion of the momentum spectrum around $\vec{P}=0$. Accordingly the

the concepts of electromagnetic field, force, energy, and momentum, which are
intimately tied together by Poynting's theorem and the Lorentz force law.
Whereas Maxwell's macroscopic equations relate the electric and magnetic fields
to their material sources (i.e., charge, current, polarization and
magnetization), Poynting's theorem governs the flow of electromagnetic energy
and its exchange between fields and material media, while the Lorentz law
regulates the back-and-forth transfer of momentum between the media and the
fields. As it turns out, an alternative force law, first proposed in 1908 by
Einstein and Laub, exists that is consistent with Maxwell's macroscopic
equations and complies with the conservation laws as well as with the
requirements of special relativity. While the Lorentz law requires the
introduction of hidden energy and hidden momentum in situations where an
electric field acts on a magnetic material, the Einstein-Laub formulation of
electromagnetic force and torque does not invoke hidden entities under such
circumstances. Moreover, the total force and the total torque exerted by
electromagnetic fields on any given object turn out to be independent of
whether force and torque densities are evaluated using the Lorentz law or in
accordance with the Einstein-Laub formulas. Hidden entities aside, the two
formulations differ only in their predicted force and torque distributions
throughout material media. Such differences in distribution are occasionally
measurable, and could serve as a guide in deciding which formulation, if
either, corresponds to physical reality.

each point is a linear vector subspace, and is widely regarded as an ideal
model for multi-dimensional signals. In this paper, we formulate the linear
subspace spanned by multi-dimensional signal vectors as points on the Grassmann
manifold, and use the volume and the product of sines of principal angles (also
known as the product of principal sines) as the generalized norm and distance
measure for the space of Grassmann manifold. We prove a volume-preserving
embedding property for points on the Grassmann manifold via Gaussian random
measurement matrices, i.e., the volumes of all parallelotopes from a finite set
in Grassmann manifold are preserved upon compression. This volume-preserving
embedding property is a multi-dimensional generalization of the conventional
stable embedding properties, which only concern the approximate preservation of
lengths of vectors in certain unions of subspaces. Additionally, we use the
volume-preserving embedding property to explore the stable embedding effect on
a generalized distance measure of Grassmann manifold induced from volume. It is
proved that the generalized distance measure, i.e., the product of principal
sines between different points on the Grassmann manifold, is well preserved in
the compressed domain via Gaussian random measurement matrices.Numerical

the problem of power scheduling of Kalman filtering for general linear
stochastic systems subject to data packet drops (over a packet-dropping

to communicate every component to the estimator across a packet-dropping

least impact on the estimator mean squared error. Under the customary
assumption that the predicted density is (approximately) Gaussian, leveraging
the statistical distribution of sensor data, the mechanism of power scheduling,
the wireless network effect and the received data, the minimum mean squared
error estimator is derived. By investigating the statistical convergence
properties of the estimation error covariance, we establish, for general linear

When a light pulse is reflected from, transmitted through, or absorbed by a

exchanged, while the total amount of each entity remains intact. The extent of
such exchanges between light and matter can be deduced, among other methods,
with the aid of the Doppler shift phenomenon. The main focus of the present
paper is on the transfer of angular momentum from a monochromatic light pulse
to spinning objects such as a mirror, an absorptive dielectric, or a
birefringent plate. The fact that individual photons of frequency omega carry
energy in the amount of h_bar*omega, where h_bar is Planck's reduced constant,
enables one to relate the Doppler shift to the amount of energy exchanged.
Under certain circumstances, the knowledge of exchanged energy leads directly
to a determination of the momentum transferred from the photon to the material

V stars, identified by the VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey in the 30 Doradus region
of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We obtained the stellar and wind
parameters of both samples using the FASTWIND stellar atmosphere code and the
IACOB-GBAT grid-based automatic tool. In the framework of a differential study,
we compared the physical and evolutionary properties of both samples, regarding
Teff, logg, logQ and logL. We also investigated the predictions of the FASTWIND
code about the O Vz phenomenon. RESULTS. We find a differential distribution of
objects in terms of effective temperature, with O Vz stars dominant at
intermediate values. The O Vz stars in 30 Doradus tend to be younger and less
luminous, and they have weaker winds than the O V stars, but we also find
examples with ages of 2-4 Myr and with luminosities and winds that are similar
to those of normal O dwarfs. Moreover, the O Vz stars do not appear to have
higher gravities than the O V stars. In addition to effective temperature and
wind strength, our FASTWIND predictions indicate how important it is to take
other stellar parameters (gravity and projected rotational velocity) into
account for correctly interpreting the O Vz phenomenon. CONCLUSIONS. In
general, the O Vz stars appear to be on or very close to the ZAMS, but there
are some examples where the Vz classification does not necessarily imply
extreme youth. In particular, the presence of O Vz stars in our sample at more
evolved phases than expected is likely a consequence of modest O-star winds
owing to the low-metallicity environment of the LMC.

with the Urbana IX three-nucleon force, the effective Skyrme model in a

polarized to partially polarized matter that leads to a continuous equation of
state. The compressibility and the magnetic susceptibility show characteristic
behaviors, which reflect that fact. Thermal effects tend to smear out the
sharpness found for these quantities at T=0. In most cases a thermal increase
of 10 MeV is enough to hide the signals of the change of polarization. The set
of densities and magnetic field intensities for which the system changes it

than 200 million source measurements in far-UV (FUV) and near-UV (NUV), as well
as wide-field imaging of extended objects, filling an important gap in our view
of the sky across the electromagnetic spectrum. The UV surveys offer unique
sensitivity for identifying and studying selected classes of astrophysical
objects, both stellar and extra-galactic. We examine the overall content and

quality, eliminating duplicate measurements of the same source. Such catalogs
can facilitate a variety of investigations on UV-selected samples, as well as
planning of observations with future missions.
  We describe the criteria used to build the catalogs, their coverage and
completeness. We included observations in which both the far-UV and near-UV
detectors were exposed; 28,707 fields from the All-Sky Imaging survey (AIS)
cover a unique area of 22,080 square degrees (after we restrict the catalogs to
the central 1-degree diameter of the field), with a typical depth of about
20/21 mag (FUV/NUV, in the AB mag system), and 3,008 fields from the
Medium-depth Imaging Survey (MIS) cover a total of 2,251 square degrees at a
depth of about 22.7mag. The catalogs contain about 71 and 16.6 million sources
respectively. The density of hot stars reflects the Galactic structure, and the
number counts of both Galactic and extra-galactic sources are modulated by the

high biosafety (BSL-4) laboratories entered into operation, raising strong
concerns from the public. The probability of an accidental release of a
pathogen from a BSL-4 laboratory is extremely low, but the corresponding risk
-- defined as the probability of occurrence multiplied by its impact -- could
be significant depending on the pathogen specificities and the population
potentially affected. A list of BSL-4 laboratories throughout the world, with
their location and date of first activity, was established from publicly
available sources. This database was used to estimate the total population
living within a daily commuting distance of BSL-4 laboratories, and to quantify
how this figure changed over time. We show that from 1990 to present, the
population living within the commuting belt of BSL-4 laboratories increased by
a factor of 4 to reach up to 1.8% of the world population, owing to an increase
in the number of facilities and their installation in cities. Europe is
currently hosting the largest population living in the direct vicinity of BSL-4
laboratories, while the recent building of new facilities in Asia suggests that
an important increase of the population living close to BSL-4 laboratories will
be observed in the next decades. We discuss the potential implications in term

reviewing on the spectral property of Anderson tight-binding Hamiltonians as
described by nonlinear sigma models and random matrices, and on the
scale-invariant intermediate spectral statistics at the mobility edge. By
fitting the level spacing distributions, deformed random matrix ensembles which
model multifractality of the wave functions typical of the Anderson
localization transition, are shown to provide an excellent effective
description for such a critical statistics. Next we carry over the above
strategy for the Anderson Hamiltonians to the Dirac spectra. For the staggered
Dirac operators of QCD with 2+1 flavors of dynamical quarks at the physical
point and of SU(2) quenched gauge theory, we identify the precise location of
the mobility edge as the scale-invariant fixed point of the level spacing
distribution. The eigenvalues around the mobility edge are shown to obey
critical statistics described by the aforementioned deformed random matrix
ensembles of unitary and symplectic classes. The best-fitting deformation
parameter for QCD at the physical point turns out to be consistent with the
Anderson Hamiltonian in the unitary class. Finally, we propose a method of
locating the mobility edge at the origin of QCD Dirac spectrum around the
critical temperature, by the use of individual eigenvalue distributions of

results strengthen the interpretation of these upper bounds, in the sense that
we now know that the probability of correctly decoding a classical message

a strong converse rate, and we prove this result by utilizing the structural
decomposition of a thermal channel into a pure-loss channel followed by an
amplifier channel. Our second theorem demonstrates that Giovannetti et al.'s

to a strong converse rate, and we prove this result by relating success
probability to rate, the effective dimension of the output space, and the
purity of the channel as measured by the Renyi collision entropy. Finally, we
use similar techniques to prove that similar previously known upper bounds on

Other contribution of this work is to reveal the similarities between the BGEP

This fact leads to the proposal of two new exact approaches for the MCFP based
on mathematical formulations for the BGEP. Both approaches use the grouping
efficacy measure as the objective function. Up to the authors' knowledge, these
are the first exact methods that employ such a measure to optimally solve

several calls to a parameterized version of the BGEP, and the second is a
linearization of a new fractional-linear model for the MCFP. Computational

that our exact methods for the MCFP are able to prove several previously

Planck CMB data do not exclude the presence of non-Gaussianity of small
amplitude, although they are consistent with the Gaussian hypothesis. The use
of different techniques is essential to provide information about types and
amplitudes of non-Gaussianities in the CMB data. In particular, we find
interesting to construct an estimator based upon the combination of two
powerful statistical tools that appears to be sensitive enough to detect tiny
deviations from Gaussianity in CMB maps. This estimator combines the Minkowski
functionals with a Neural Network, maximizing a tool widely used to study
non-Gaussian signals with a reinforcement of another tool designed to identify
patterns in a data set. We test our estimator by analyzing simulated CMB maps
contaminated with different amounts of local primordial non-Gaussianity
quantified by the dimensionless parameter fNL. We apply it to these sets of CMB
maps and find \gtrsim 98% of chance of positive detection, even for small
intensity local non-Gaussianity like fNL = 38 +/- 18, the current limit from
Planck data for large angular scales. Additionally, we test the suitability to
distinguish between primary and secondary non-Gaussianities and find out that
our method successfully classifies ~ 95% of the tested maps. Furthermore, we
analyze the foreground-cleaned Planck maps obtaining constraints for
non-Gaussianity at large-angles that are in good agreement with recent
constraints. Finally, we also test the robustness of our estimator including
cut-sky masks and realistic noise maps measured by Planck, obtaining successful

processing units, execution environments, computational loads etc. This problem
is especially stringent for HPC numerical simulations. In what follows, the
focus is on parallel implementations of interval arithmetic using
floating-point arithmetic. For interval computations, numerical reproducibility
is of course an issue for testing and debugging purposes. However, as long as
the computed result encloses the exact and unknown result, the inclusion
property, which is the main property of interval arithmetic, is satisfied and
getting bit for bit identical results may not be crucial. Still, implementation
issues may invalidate the inclusion property. Several ways to preserve the
inclusion property are presented, on the example of the product of matrices
with interval coefficients.

the $217\,\text{GHz}\times 217\,\text{GHz}$ detector set spectrum used in the
Planck analysis is responsible for some of this tension. We use a map-based
foreground cleaning procedure, relying on a combination of 353 GHz and 545 GHz
maps to reduce residual foregrounds in the intermediate frequency maps used for
cosmological inference. For our baseline data analysis, which uses 47% of the
sky and makes use of both 353 and 545 GHz data for foreground cleaning, we find
the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameters $\Omega_c h^2 = 0.1170 \pm 0.0025$,
$n_s = 0.9686 \pm 0.0069$, $H_0 = 68.0 \pm 1.1\,\mathrm{km}

agreement with the results reported by the Planck team, these revised
parameters imply a universe with a lower matter density of
$\Omega_m=0.302\pm0.015$, and parameter values generally more consistent with
pre-Planck CMB analyses and astronomical observations. We compare our cleaning
procedure with the foreground modeling used by the Planck team and find good
agreement. The difference in parameters between our analysis and that of the
Planck team is mostly due to our use of cross-spectra from the publicly
available survey maps instead of their use of the detector set cross-spectra
which include pixels only observed in one of the surveys. We show evidence
suggesting residual systematics in the detector set spectra used in the Planck

amplitudes are expanded at low energies and small $u,d,s$ quark masses about an
infrared fixed point $\alpha^{}_\mathrm{IR}$ of 3-flavor QCD. At
$\alpha^{}_\mathrm{IR}$, the quark condensate $\langle

$\pi, K, \eta$ and a $0^{++}$ QCD dilaton $\sigma$. Physically, $\sigma$
appears as the $f_{0}(500)$ resonance, a pole at a complex mass with real part
$\lesssim m_K$. The $\Delta I=1/2$ rule for nonleptonic $K$-decays is then a
consequence of $\chi$PT$_\sigma$, with a $K_S\sigma$ coupling fixed by data for
$\gamma\gamma\rightarrow\pi\pi$ and $K_{S} \to \gamma\gamma$. We estimate
$R_\mathrm{IR} \approx 5$ for the nonperturbative Drell-Yan ratio $R =
\sigma(e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow\mathrm{hadrons})/
  \sigma(e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-})$ at $\alpha^{}_\mathrm{IR}$, and
show that, in the many-color limit, $\sigma/f_0$ becomes a narrow $q\bar{q}$
state with planar-gluon corrections. Rules for the order of terms in
$\chi$PT$_\sigma$ loop expansions are derived in Appendix A, and extended in
Appendix B to include inverse-power Li-Pagels singularities due to external
operators. This relates to an observation that, for $\gamma\gamma$ channels,
partial conservation of the dilatation current is not equivalent to
$\sigma$-pole dominance.

the CO-dark H2 layer varies significantly from cloud-to-cloud with an average
9X10^(20) cm-2. These clouds contain a significant fraction of CO-dark H2 mass,
varying from ~75% for diffuse molecular clouds to ~20% for dense molecular
clouds. Conclusions: We find a significant fraction of the warm molecular ISM
gas is invisible in HI and CO, but is detected in [CII]. The fraction of
CO-dark H2 is greatest in the diffuse clouds and decreases with increasing
total column density, and is lowest in the massive clouds.

planetary habitability. Observationally, the number of small-radius, transiting
planets with accompanying mass measurements is insufficient for a robust
determination of the transitional mass or radius. Theoretically, models predict
that rocky planets can grow large enough to become gas giants when they reach
~10 Earth-masses, but the transitional mass remains unknown. Here I show how
transit data, interpreted in the context of tidal theory, can reveal the
critical radius that separates rocky and gaseous exoplanets. Standard tidal
models predict that rocky exoplanets' orbits are tidally circularized much more
rapidly than gaseous bodies', suggesting the former will tend to be found on
circular orbits at larger semi-major axes than the latter. Well-sampled
transits can provide a minimum eccentricity of the orbit, allowing a
measurement of this differential circularization. I show that this effect
should be present in the data from the Kepler spacecraft, but is not apparent.
Instead, it appears that there is no evidence of tidal circularization at any
planetary radius, probably because the publicly-available data, particularly
the impact parameters, are not accurate enough. I also review the bias in the
transit duration toward values that are smaller than that of planets on
circular orbits, stressing that the azimuthal velocity of the planet determines
the transit duration. The ensemble of Kepler planet candidates may be able to
determine the critical radius between rocky and gaseous exoplanets, tidal
dissipation as a function of planetary radius, and discriminate between tidal
models.

  galaxies","24 pages, 14 figures, accepted MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stt2306",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Identifying galaxy clustering at high redshift (i.e. z > 1) is essential to
our understanding of the current cosmological model. However, at increasing
redshift, clusters evolve considerably in star-formation activity and so are
less likely to be identified using the widely-used red sequence method. Here we
assess the viability of instead identifying high redshift clustering using
actively star-forming galaxies (SMGs associated with over-densities of
BzKs/LBGs). We perform both a 2- and 3-D clustering analysis to determine
whether or not true (3D) clustering can be identified where only 2D data are
available. As expected, we find that 2D clustering signals are weak at best and
inferred results are method dependant. In our 3D analysis, we identify 12 SMGs
associated with an over-density of galaxies coincident both spatially and in
redshift - just 8% of SMGs with known redshifts in our sample. Where an SMG in
our target fields lacks a known redshift, their sightline is no more likely to
display clustering than blank sky fields; prior redshift information for the
SMG is required to identify a true clustering signal. We find that the strength
of clustering in the volume around typical SMGs, while identifiable, is not
exceptional. However, we identify a small number of highly clustered regions,
all associated with an SMG. The most notable of these, surrounding
LESSJ033336.8-274401, potentially contains an SMG, a QSO and 36 star-forming
galaxies (a > 20sig over-density) all at z~1.8. This region is highly likely to
represent an actively star-forming cluster and illustrates the success of using
star-forming galaxies to select sites of early clustering. Given the increasing
number of deep fields with large volumes of spectroscopy, or high quality and
reliable photometric redshifts, this opens a new avenue for cluster
identification in the young Universe.

probable cluster members with bolometric luminosities >1e12 Lo and show that by
virtue of their dust content and activity, these represent some of the reddest
and brightest galaxies in this structure. We exploit Cycle-1 ALMA submillimeter
continuum imaging which covers one of these sources to confirm the
identification of a SCUBA-2-detected ultraluminous star-forming galaxy in this
structure. Integrating the total star-formation activity in the central region
of the structure, we estimate that it is an order of magnitude higher (in a
mass-normalised sense) than clusters at z~0.5-1. However, we also find that the
most active cluster members do not reside in the densest regions of the
structure, which instead host a population of passive and massive, red
galaxies. We suggest that while the passive and active populations have
comparable near-infrared luminosities at z=1.6, M(H)~-23, the subsequent
stronger fading of the more active galaxies means that they will evolve into
passive systems at the present-day which are less luminous than the descendants
of those galaxies which were already passive at z~1.6 (M(H)~-20.5 and
M(H)~-21.5 respectively at z~0). We conclude that the massive galaxy population
in the dense cores of present-day clusters were already in place at z=1.6 and
that in Cl0218.3-0510 we are seeing continuing infall of less extreme, but
still ultraluminous, star-forming galaxies onto a pre-existing structure.

similar tuning is also present in the GW mechanism. The lowest scalar

has both radion-like and Higgs-like couplings to the SM fields. It, thus, plays

The AGN sample is divided into low and high X-ray luminosity classes, and into
unobscured (type-1) and obscured (type-2) classes by means of X-ray and optical
spectroscopy data. Specifically in the X-rays regime, we adopt the intrinsic
luminosity taking into account the estimated column density (N_H). We also take
the chance to highlight important differences resulting from adopting different

we also find that AGN IR-selection efficiency shows a decrease with decreasing
source AGN X-ray luminosity. For the intermediate-luminosity AGN population
(43.3<~log(L_X[erg/s])<~44$), the efficiency also worsens with increasing
obscuration. The same sample also shows an evolution with cosmic time of the
obscured fraction at the highest X-ray luminosities, independently of adopted
type-1/type-2 classification method. CONCLUSIONS. We confirm that AGN
IR-selection is genuinely biased toward unobscured AGN, but only at
intermediate luminosities. At the highest luminosities, where AGN IR-selection
is more efficient, there is no obscuration bias. We show that type-1 AGN are
intrinsically more luminous than type-2 AGN only at z<~1.6, thus resulting in
more type-1 AGN being selected the shallower the IR survey is. [ABRIDGED:
Conclusion on survey strategy. See manuscript.] Finally, when the James Webb
Space Telescope comes online, the broad-band filters 2.0um, 4.4um, 7.7um, and
18um will be key to disentangle AGN from non-AGN dominated SEDs at depths where
spectroscopy becomes impractical.

climate is expected to warm, increasing water evaporation which, in turn,
enhances the atmospheric greenhouse effect. Above a certain critical
insolation, this destabilizing greenhouse feedback can ""runaway"" until all the
oceans are evaporated. Through increases in stratospheric humidity, warming may
also cause oceans to escape to space before the runaway greenhouse occurs. The
critical insolation thresholds for these processes, however, remain uncertain
because they have so far been evaluated with unidimensional models that cannot
account for the dynamical and cloud feedback effects that are key stabilizing
features of Earth's climate. Here we use a 3D global climate model to show that
the threshold for the runaway greenhouse is about 375 W/m$^2$, significantly
higher than previously thought. Our model is specifically developed to quantify
the climate response of Earth-like planets to increased insolation in hot and
extremely moist atmospheres. In contrast with previous studies, we find that
clouds have a destabilizing feedback on the long term warming. However,
subsident, unsaturated regions created by the Hadley circulation have a
stabilizing effect that is strong enough to defer the runaway greenhouse limit
to higher insolation than inferred from 1D models. Furthermore, because of
wavelength-dependent radiative effects, the stratosphere remains cold and dry
enough to hamper atmospheric water escape, even at large fluxes. This has
strong implications for Venus early water history and extends the size of the
habitable zone around other stars.

background fields evolving along the flat directions implied by the symmetries.
In this context, the field fluctuations along the broken symmetry are well
parametrized by a Goldstone boson field that may non-trivially interact with
other fields present in the theory. These interactions violate Lorentz
invariance as a result of the broken time translation invariance of the
background, producing a mixing between the field content and the particle
spectrum of the theory. In this article we study the effects of such
interactions on the low energy dynamics of the Goldstone boson quanta, paying
special attention to the role of the particle spectrum of the theory. By
studying the particular case of a canonical two-field model with a mexican-hat
potential, we analyze the derivation of the low energy effective field theory
for the Goldstone boson, and discuss in detail the distinction between
integrating fields v/s integrating quanta, to finally conclude that they are
equivalent. In addition, we discuss the implications of our analysis for the
study of systems where time translation invariance is broken, such as cosmic

intensities close to 3 TW/cm$^2$ and 7.5 TW/cm$^2$, respectively. The Au
nanowires attached to silica slides melt at slightly higher intensities, just
above 10 TW/cm$^2$ for 32 fs pulses. Our results can be explained with an
electron-phonon interaction model that describes the absorbed laser energy and
subsequent heat conduction across the wire.

associated separatrices and quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) where magnetic
reconnection is prone to occur. The presence of null points is confirmed by a
linear and a non-linear force-free magnetic-field model. Their locations and
general characteristics are similar in both modelling approaches, which
supports their robustness. However, in order to explain the full extension of
the analysed event brightenings, which are not restricted to the photospheric

this more complete topological analysis, we propose a scenario to explain the
origin of a low-energy event preceding a filament eruption, which is
accompanied by a two-ribbon flare, and a consecutive confined flare in AR

around the entire rim. We find that the expansion velocity varies significantly
with azimuth: the highest velocity of ~7400 km/s (almost 2.5 times that in the
NW) is found along the SE rim, where both kinematics and spectra indicate that
most of the X-rays stem from undecelerated ejecta. Asymmetries in the
distribution of ejecta are seen on a variety of spatial scales. Si-rich ejecta
are especially prominent in the SE quadrant, while O and Mg are more uniformly
distributed, indicating large-scale asymmetries arising from the explosion
itself. Ne emission is strongest in a sharp filament just behind the primary
shock along the NW rim, where the preshock density is highest. Here the Ne is
likely interstellar, while Ne within the shell may include a contribution from
ejecta. Within the interior of the projected shell we find a few isolated
""bullets"" of what appear to be supernova ejecta that are immediately preceded
by bowshocks seen in H-alpha--features we interpret as ejecta knots that have
reached relatively dense regions of the surrounding ISM. Recent 3-dimensional
hydrodynamic models for SN Ia display small-scale features that resemble the
ones seen in X-rays in SN1006; an origin in the explosion itself or from
subsequent instabilities both remain viable options. We have expanded the
search for precursor X-ray emission ahead of a synchrotron-dominated shock
front. Profiles along both NE and SW rims require that a precursor be thinner
than about 3 arcsec and fainter than about 5% of the post-shock peak. These

multi-zone model, with the accretion rate regulated by feedback from an
evolving disk-wind outflow cavity. Disk and envelope evolutions are calculated
self-consistently. In this framework, an evolutionary track is determined by
three environmental initial conditions: the initial core mass M_c, the mean
surface density of the ambient star-forming clump Sigma_cl, and the
rotational-to-gravitational energy ratio of the initial core, beta_c.
Evolutionary sequences with various M_c, Sigma_cl, beta_c are constructed. We
find that in a fiducial model with M_c=60Msun, Sigma_cl=1 g/cm^2 and
beta_c=0.02, the final star formation efficiency >~0.43. For each evolutionary
track, RT simulations are performed at selected stages, with temperature
profiles, SEDs, and images produced. At a given stage the envelope temperature
is highly dependent on Sigma_cl, but only weakly dependent on M_c. The SED and
MIR images depend sensitively on the evolving outflow cavity, which gradually
wides as the protostar grows. The fluxes at <~100 microns increase
dramatically, and the far-IR peaks move to shorter wavelengths. We find that,
despite scatter caused by different M_c, Sigma_cl, beta, and inclinations,
sources at a given evolutionary stage appear in similar regions on color-color
diagrams, especially when using colors at >~ 70 microns, where the scatter due
to the inclination is minimized, implying that such diagrams can be useful
diagnostic tools of evolutionary stages of massive protostars. We discuss how
intensity profiles along or perpendicular to the outflow axis are affected by

Two different settings are introduced, namely, straight-coupled dimers, where
each gain site is linearly coupled to one gain and one loss site, and
cross-coupled dimers, with each gain site coupled to two lossy ones. The latter
pair with equal coupling coefficients represents a ""PT-hypersymmetric""
quadrimer. We find symmetric and antisymmetric solutions in these systems,
chiefly in an analytical form, and explore the existence, stability and
dynamical behavior of such solutions by means of numerical methods. We thus
identify bifurcations occurring in the systems, including spontaneous symmetry
breaking and saddle-center bifurcations. Simulations demonstrate that evolution
of unstable branches typically leads to blowup. However, in some cases unstable
modes rearrange into stable ones.

generalized form of the Lorentz law of force. These seven postulates constitute
the foundation of a complete and consistent theory, thus eliminating the need
for actual (i.e., physical) models of polarization P and magnetization M, these
being the distinguishing features of Maxwell's macroscopic equations. In the
proposed formulation, P(r,t) and M(r,t) are arbitrary functions of space and
time, their physical properties being embedded in the seven postulates of the
theory. The postulates are self-consistent, comply with the requirements of the
special theory of relativity, and satisfy the laws of conservation of energy,
linear momentum, and angular momentum. One advantage of the proposed
formulation is that it side-steps the long-standing Abraham-Minkowski
controversy surrounding the electromagnetic momentum inside a material medium
by simply ""assigning"" the Abraham momentum density E(r,t) x H(r,t)/c^2 to the
electromagnetic field. This well-defined momentum is thus taken to be universal
as it does not depend on whether the field is propagating or evanescent, and
whether or not the host medium is homogeneous, transparent, isotropic,
dispersive, magnetic, linear, etc. In other words, the local and instantaneous
momentum density is uniquely and unambiguously specified at each and every
point of the material system in terms of the E and H fields residing at that
point. Any variation with time of the total electromagnetic momentum of a
closed system results in a force exerted on the material media within the
system in accordance with the generalized Lorentz law.

barred spiral galaxies using 3.6 $\mu {\rm m}$ images from the Spitzer Survey
of Stellar Structure in Galaxies. Our model fit includes up to four components
(bulge, disk, bar, and a point source) and, most importantly, takes into
account disk breaks. We find that ignoring the disk break and using a single
disk scale length in the model fit for Type II (down-bending) disk galaxies can
lead to differences of 40% in the disk scale length, 10% in bulge-to-total
luminosity ratio (B/T), and 25% in bar-to-total luminosity ratios. We find that
for galaxies with B/T $\geq$ 0.1, the break radius to bar radius, $r_{\rm
br}/R_{\rm bar}$, varies between 1 and 3, but as a function of B/T the ratio
remains roughly constant. This suggests that in bulge-dominated galaxies the
disk break is likely related to the outer Lindblad Resonance (OLR) of the bar,
and thus moves outwards as the bar grows. For galaxies with small bulges, B/T
$<$ 0.1, $r_{\rm br}/R_{\rm bar}$ spans a wide range from 1 to 6. This suggests
that the mechanism that produces the break in these galaxies may be different
from that in galaxies with more massive bulges. Consistent with previous
studies, we conclude that disk breaks in galaxies with small bulges may
originate from bar resonances that may be also coupled with the spiral arms, or
be related to star formation thresholds.

conservative approximation of the discriminating kernel using robust maximal

for reachability, a piecewise ellipsoidal algorithm with polynomial complexity
is described that under-approximates the discriminating kernel under LTI

synthesize a permissive state-feedback safety-preserving controller. The
controller is modeled as a hybrid automaton and can be formulated such that
under certain conditions the resulting control signal is continuous across its

light sterile neutrinos, within a local vector $SU(3)$ family symmetry model.
In this scenario, ordinary heavy fermions, top and bottom quarks and tau
lepton, become massive at tree level from {\bf Dirac See-saw} mechanisms
implemented by the introduction of a new set of $SU(2)_L$ weak singlet
vector-like fermions, $U,D,E,N$, with $N$ a sterile neutrino. The $N_{L,R}$
sterile neutrinos allow the implementation of a $8\times 8$ general tree level
See-saw Majorana neutrino mass matrix with four massless eigenvalues. Hence,
light fermions, including light neutrinos obtain masses from one loop radiative
corrections mediated by the massive $SU(3)$ gauge bosons. This BSM model is
able to accommodate the known spectrum of quark masses and mixing in a $4\times
4$ non-unitary $V_{CKM}$ as well as the charged lepton masses. The explored
parameter space region provide the vector-like fermion masses: $M_D \approx

occur at about 1 kGy. The high-dose high-temperature TL emission of LiF:Mg,Cu,P
observed at the IFJ in 2006, which above 30 kGy takes the form of the so-called

high and ultra-high range, in particular for the monitoring of ionizing
radiation around the essential electronic elements of high-energy accelerators,
also fission and fusion facilities, as well as for emergency dosimetry. This
discovery initiated studies of high and ultra-high dose characteristics of both
of these phosphors, which turned out to be significantly different in many
aspects. These studies not only strive to refine the method for measuring high
doses based on the observed phenomenon, but also, and perhaps above all, bring
us closer to understanding its origin and essence. This manuscript aims to
review existing research data on the high and ultra-high dose features of both

with orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP). The main part of STrMP is as concise as
OMP and hence STrMP is simple to implement. In contrast to previous greedy
algorithms for one-bit compressed sensing, STrMP only need to solve a convex
and unconstraint subproblem at each iteration. Numerical experiments show that
STrMP is fast and accurate for one-bit compressed sensing compared with other
algorithms.

from SDSS and UKIDSS, we train a forward model to emulate the colour-change due
to physical properties of stars and the interstellar medium for temperatures
from 4000 to 9000 K and extinctions from 0 to 5 mag. We introduce a
Hertzsprung-Russel diagram prior to account for physical constraints on the
distribution of stars in the temperature-absolute magnitude plane. This allows
us to infer distances probabilistically. Influences of colour information,
priors and model parameters are explored. Residual mean absolute errors (MAEs)
on a set of objects for extinction and temperature are 0.2 mag and 300 K,
respectively, for $R_0$ fixed to 3.1. For variable $R_0$, we obtain MAEs of
0.37 mag, 412.9 K and 0.74 for $A_0$, $T_{\rm eff}$ and $R_0$, respectively.
Distance moduli are accurate to approximately 2 mag. Quantifying the precisions
of individual parameter estimates with $68\%$ confidence interval of the
posterior distribution, we obtain 0.05 mag, 66 K, 2 mag and 0.07 for $A_0$,
$T_{\rm eff}$, $\mu$ and $R_0$, respectively, although we find that these
underestimate the accuracy of the model. We produce two-dimensional maps in
extinction and $R_0$ that are compared to previous work. Furthermore we
incorporate the inferred distance information to compute fully probabilistic
distance profiles for individual lines of sight. The individual stellar AP
estimates, combined with inferred 3D information will make possible many

mechanics based on reduced density matrices of sub-systems from which the
standard Copenhagen interpretation emerges as an effective description of
macroscopically large systems. Wave function collapse is seen to be a useful
but fundamentally unnecessary piece of prudent book keeping which is only valid
for macro-systems. The new interpretation lies in a class of modal
interpretations in that it applies to quantum systems that interact with a much
larger environment. However, we show that it does not suffer from the problems
that have plagued similar modal interpretations like macroscopic superpositions
and rapid flipping between macroscopically distinct states. We describe how the
interpretation fits neatly together with fully quantum formulations of
statistical mechanics and that a measurement process can be viewed as a process
of ergodicity breaking analogous to a phase transition. The key feature of the
new interpretation is that joint probabilities for the ergodic subsets of
states of disjoint macro-systems only arise as emergent quantities. Finally we
give an account of the EPR-Bohm thought experiment and show that the
interpretation implies the violation of the Bell inequality characteristic of
quantum mechanics but in a way that is rather novel. The final conclusion is
that the Copenhagen interpretation gives a completely satisfactory
phenomenology of macro-systems interacting with micro-systems.

$a_n^{(W,S)}\leq a_n^{(W',S')}$ for all $n\in \mathbb{N}_0$, where $\preceq$ is
a suitable partial order on Coxeter systems (cf. Thm. A).

another Coxeter generating set $\mu(S)$. A generalisation of the diagram

which considers the Curie-Weiss model with Ising spins interacting via a
quadratic potential and subjected to independent spins flips, we follow the
program outlined in \cite{vEFedHoRe10}. We show that in the thermodynamic limit
the system is non-Gibbs at time $t \in (0,\infty)$ if and only if there exists
an $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ such that the large deviation rate function for the
trajectory of the magnetization conditional on hitting the value $\alpha$ at
time $t$ has multiple global minimizers. We further show that different
minimizing trajectories are different at time $t=0$. We give conditions on the
potential under which the system is Gibbs at time $t=0$, classify the possible
scenarios of being Gibbs at time $t \in (0,\infty)$ in terms of the second
difference quotient of the potential, and show that the system cannot become
Gibbs once it has become non-Gibbs, i.e., there is a unique and explicitly
computable crossover time $t_c \in [0,\infty]$ from Gibbs to non-Gibbs. We give
examples of immediate loss of Gibbsianness ($t_c=0$), short-time conservation
of Gibbsianness, large-time loss of Gibbsianness ($t_c\in (0,\infty)$), and
preservation of Gibbsianness ($t_c=\infty$). Depending on the potential, the

information on OSNs, but few quantitative studies on this. This research
explores the activity of sharing mobile numbers on OSNs, via public profiles

numbers sharing behaviour on OSNs and focus on Indian mobile numbers. We
collected 76,347 unique mobile numbers posted by 85905 users on Twitter and
Facebook and analysed 2997 numbers, prefixed with +91. We observed, most users
shared their own mobile numbers to spread urgent information; and to market
products and escort business. Fewer female users shared mobile numbers on OSNs.
Users utilized other OSN platforms and third party applications like
Twitterfeed, to post mobile numbers on multiple OSNs. In contrast to the user's
perception of numbers spreading quickly on OSN, we observed that except for
emergency, most numbers did not diffuse deep. To assess risks associated with
mobile numbers exposed on OSNs, we used numbers to gain sensitive information
about their owners (e.g. name, Voter ID) by collating publicly available data
from OSNs, Truecaller, OCEAN. On using the numbers on WhatApp, we obtained a
myriad of sensitive details (relationship status, BBM pins) of the number
owner. We communicated the observed risks to the owners by calling. Few users
were surprised to know about the online presence of their number, while a few
others intentionally posted it online for business purposes. We observed, 38.3%
of users who were unaware of the online presence of their number have posted
their number themselves on the social network. With these observations, we
highlight that there is a need to monitor leakage of mobile numbers via profile

study to critically investigate the exposure of Indian mobile numbers on OSNs.

Galametz et al. (2011) totalling 126 galaxies, covering a 2 dex metallicity
range, with 30% of the sample with 12+log(O/H) < 8.0. The dust masses are
homogeneously determined with a semi-empirical dust model, including submm
constraints. The atomic and molecular gas masses are compiled from the
literature. Two XCO are used to estimate molecular gas masses: the Galactic
XCO, and a XCO depending on the metallicity (as Z^{-2}). Correlations with
morphological types, stellar masses, star formation rates and specific star
formation rates are discussed. The trend between G/D and metallicity is
empirically modelled using power-laws (slope of -1 and free) and a broken
power-law. We compare the evolution of the G/D with predictions from chemical
evolution models. We find that out of the five tested galactic parameters,
metallicity is the galactic property driving the observed G/D. The G/D versus
metallicity relation cannot be represented by a power-law with a slope of -1
over the whole metallicity range. The observed trend is steeper for
metallicities lower than ~ 8.0. A large scatter is observed in the G/D for a
given metallicity, with a dispersion of 0.37 dex in metallicity bins of ~0.1
dex. The broken power-law reproduces best the observed G/D and provides
estimates of the G/D that are accurate to a factor of 1.6. The good agreement
of the G/D and its scatter with the three tested chemical evolution models
shows that the scatter is intrinsic to galactic properties, reflecting the
different star formation histories, dust destruction efficiencies, dust grain
size distributions and chemical compositions across the sample. (abriged)

to others-- and altruism --which provides benefits to others at a cost to
oneself-- has been on the core of the evolutionary game theoretical framework
since its foundation. The fast development of the theory during the last years
has improved our knowledge of the issue, but carried attached a diversification
of concepts which affected communication between scientists. Furthermore, the
main root of conflict in the struggle for life identified by Darwin, the
limited amount of resources present in any ecosystem, which is assumed to keep
a constant population size in most game theoretical studies, has only recently
been taken into account as explicitly influencing the evolutionary process.
This review concerns about both issues, the conceptual diversification during
the last years and the new results of the resource dependent models. In
extenso: After a historical introduction, a review of the most important
concepts is carried out. Then it is shown that pairwise interactions and
additive fitness determine prisoner's dilemmas (PDs) or harmony games, that two
altruists interacting together may determine a PD, and that the interaction
environment of the most cooperative and less selfish individual in any
population is always a PD. After that, it is shown that in addition to
altruists versus free-riders, the combination of free-riders and parasites
determines a fundamentally different PD. Computer simulations are then carried
out to show that random exploration of parasitism, free-riding and altruism
enables coexistence of the three strategies without the need of reciprocating,
punishing or rewarding strategies. To finish, the problem of the limitation of

important acceleration mechanism in various astrophysical jet sources,
including radio-loud AGN. An important recent development for blazar science is
the ability of Fermi-LAT data to pin down the power-law index of the high
energy portion of emission in these sources, and therefore also the index of
the underlying non-thermal particle population. This diagnostic potential was
not possible prior to Fermi launch, when gamma-ray information was dominated by
the highly-absorbed TeV band. This paper highlights how multiwavelength spectra
including X-ray band and Fermi data can be used to probe diffusive acceleration
in relativistic, oblique, MHD shocks in blazar jets. The spectral index of the
non-thermal particle distributions resulting from Monte Carlo simulations of
DSA, and the fraction of thermal particles accelerated to non-thermal energies,
depend sensitively on the particles' mean free path scale, and also on the
magnetic field obliquity to the shock normal. We investigate self-consistently
the radiative synchrotron/Compton signatures of the resulting thermal and
non-thermal particle distributions. Important constraints on the frequency of
particle scattering and the level of field turbulence are identified for the
blazar AO 0235+164. The possible interpretation that turbulence levels decline
with remoteness from jet shocks, and a significant role for non-gyroresonant
diffusion, are discussed.

regimes, depending on the magnetic excess of the large forced scales. When the
magnetic excess is large enough, the classical perpendicular cascade with $5/3$
scaling is obtained, while when equipartition is imposed, an isotropic $3/2$
scaling appears in all directions with respect to the mean field
(\cite{2010PhRvE..82b6406G} or GM10). We show here that the $3/2$ scaling of
the GM10 regime is not ruled by a small-scale cross-helicity cascade, and
propose that it is a 3D extension of a perpendicular weak Iroshnikov-Kraichnan
(IK) cascade. We analyze in detail the structure functions in real space and
show that they closely follow the critical balance relation both in the local
frame and the global frame: we show that there is no contradiction between this
and the isotropic $3/2$ scaling of the spectra. We propose a scenario
explaining the spectral structure of the GM10 regime, that starts with a
perpendicular weak IK cascade and extends to 3D by using quasi-resonant
couplings. The quasi-resonance condition happens to reduce the energy flux in
the same way as is done in the weak perpendicular cascade, so leading to a
$3/2$ scaling in all directions. We discuss the possible applications of these
findings to solar wind turbulence.

pattern from each star of a double-star target incident on a separate detector.
Separating the pupil images for each star has several advantages including:
increased magnitude difference tolerance for the target stars; negating the
need for re-calibration due to the normalisation errors usually associated with
SCIDAR; an increase of at least a factor of two in the signal-to-noise ratio of
the cross-covariance function and hence the profile for equal magnitude target
stars and up to a factor of 16 improvement for targets of 3 magnitudes
difference; and easier real-time reconstruction of the wind-velocity profile.
Theoretical response functions are calculated for the instrument, and the
performance is investigated using a Monte-Carlo simulation. The technique is
demonstrated using data recorded at the 2.5 m Nordic Optical Telescope and the

qualitatively different from the Hern\'andez-Misner mass function. An elliptic

of $N$ quantum particles, bosons or fermions, confined in a bounded domain. It
endows the spectrum with a recurrent structure which in capillaries or
elongated traps of length $L$ and cross-section area $s_\perp$ leads to
spectral gaps $n^2h^2s_\perp\rho/(2mL)$ at wavenumbers $2n\pi s_\perp\rho$,

the flow velocity with the quantum $h/(mL)$ or that of the circulation along
the toroid with the known quantum $h/m$. Adding a ""friction"" potential which

at low flow velocities but not above a critical velocity which may be different
from the velocity of sound. In the limit of infinite $N$ and $L$, if
$N/L=s_\perp\rho$ is kept fixed, translation invariance is broken, the center

""interdictor"" and a ""flow player"". The flow player wishes to send as much
material as possible through a network, while the interdictor attempts to
minimize the amount of transported material by removing a certain number of
arcs, say $\Gamma$ arcs. We introduce the randomized network interdiction
problem that allows the interdictor to use randomness to select arcs to be
removed. We model the problem in two different ways: arc-based and path-based
formulations, depending on whether flows are defined on arcs or paths,
respectively. We present insights into the modeling power, complexity, and
approximability of both formulations. In particular, we prove that
$Z_{\text{NI}}/Z_{\text{RNI}}\leq \Gamma+1$,
$Z_{\text{NI}}/Z_{\text{RNI}}^{\text{Path}}\leq \Gamma+1$,
$Z_{\text{RNI}}/Z_{\text{RNI}}^{\text{Path}}\leq \Gamma$, where
$Z_{\text{NI}}$, $Z_{\text{RNI}}$, and $Z_{\text{RNI}}^{\text{Path}}$ are the
optimal values of the network interdiction problem and its randomized versions
in arc-based and path-based formulations, respectively. We also show that these
bounds are tight. We show that it is NP-hard to compute the values
$Z_{\text{RNI}}$ and $Z_{\text{RNI}}^{\text{Path}}$ for a general $\Gamma$, but
they are computable in polynomial time when $\Gamma=1$. Further, we provide a
$(\Gamma+1)$-approximation for $Z_{\text{NI}}$, a $\Gamma$-approximation for
$Z_{\text{RNI}}$, and a $\big(1+\lfloor \Gamma/2\rfloor \cdot \lceil

phase before the formation of its white dwarf. During this phase, a substantial
amount of mass was lost from the envelope. The recently detected orbits of
circumbinary planets are likely inconsistent with planet formation before the
mass loss.We explore whether new planets may have formed from the ejecta of the
common envelope and derive the expected planetary mass as a function of
radius.We employed the Kashi & Soker model to estimate the amount of mass that
is retained during the ejection event and inferred the properties of the
resulting disk from the conservation of mass and angular momentum. The
resulting planetary masses were estimated from models with and without
radiative feedback. We show that the observed planetary masses can be
reproduced for appropriate model parameters. Photoheating can stabilize the
disks in the interior, potentially explaining the observed planetary orbits on
scales of a few AU. We compare the expected mass scale of planets for 11
additional systems with observational results and find hints of two
populations, one consistent with planet formation from the ejecta of common
envelopes and the other a separate population that may have formed earlier. The
formation of the observed planets from the ejecta of common envelopes seems
feasible. The model proposed here can be tested through refined observations of
additional post-common envelope systems. While it appears observationally
challenging to distinguish between the accretion on pre-existing planets and
their growth from new fragments, it may be possible to further constrain the
properties of the protoplanetary disk through additional observations of
current planetary candidates and post-common envelope binary systems.

associated with the Box-Cox family while fat-tailed distributions are

proved by variations of calibration methods, but in this article, we give a
continuous family topological minimal sets, hence calibrations cannot apply.
The advantage of a set being topological minimal (compared to Almgren minimal)
is that its product with $\R^n$ stays topological minimal. This leads also to
finding minimal sets which are unions of non transversal (hence far from almost
orthogonal) planes; On the other hand, regularity for higher dimensional
minimal sets is much less clear than those of dimension 2, hence more efforts

is guaranteed only for sufficiently small prediction steps. In high-dimensional
systems, corrector steps are extremely costly to compute and the prediction
step-length must be adapted carefully to avoid failed steps or unnecessarily
slow progress. We describe a parallel method for adapting the step-length

of unconverged correction sequences to seed new predictions. This strategy
results in an aggressive optimization of the step length at the cost of

background (CMB) radiation improves our knowledge to understand the infant as
well as the presentday Universe, it also leads us to question the main
assumption of the exact isotropy of the CMB. There are two pieces of
observational evidence that hint towards there being no exact isotropy. These
are first the existence of small anisotropy deviations from isotropy of the CMB
radiation and second, the presence of large angle anomalies, although the
existence of these anomalies is currently a huge matter of debate. These hints
are particularly important since isotropy is one of the two main postulates of
the Copernican principle on which the FRW models are built. This almost
isotropic CMB radiation implies that the universe is almost a FRW universe, as
is proved by previous studies.
  Assuming the matter component forms the deviations from isotropy in the CMB
density fluctuations when matter and radiation decouples, we here attempt to
find possible constraints on the FRW type scale and Hubble parameter by using
the Bianchi type I (BI) anisotropic model which is asymptotically equivalent to
the standard FRW. To obtain constraints on such an anisotropic model, we derive
average and late-time shear values that come from the anisotropy upper limits
of the recent Planck data based on a model independent shear parameter of
Maartens et al. (1995a,b) and from the theoretical consistency relation. These
constraints lead us to obtain a BI model which becomes an almost-FRW model in
time, and which is consistent with the latest observational data of the CMB.

factor). One of these fields is scalar and associated to the Voronoi cell
volumes, whereas the other one, termed the ""geometrical polarisation"", is
vectorial, related to the very local anisotropy of the configurations. We study
the static and dynamical properties of these fields in the supercooled regime
of a model glass-forming liquid. We show in particular that the geometrical
polarisation is both statically correlated to the force field and contrary to
it develops a plateau regime when the temperature is lowered. We attribute this
behaviour to the microsopic disorder of the underlying inherent structures (IS)
which dictate the dynamics on time scales larger than the true microscopic
time, in the strong supercooled regime. In this respect, this work raises the
issue of to what extent the inter IS dynamics, intrinsically anisotropic and

language to represent information in all layers of the information system makes
it significantly easier for users to consume information. Performance data

Several recent comparisons between EOB predictions and Numerical Relativity

accurate descriptions of the dynamics and radiation of various binary systems
(comprising black holes or neutron stars) in regimes that are inaccessible to
other analytical approaches (such as the last orbits and the merger of
comparable mass black holes). In synergy with NR simulations, post-Newtonian
(PN) theory and Gravitational Self-Force (GSF) computations, the EOB formalism
is likely to provide an efficient way of computing the very many accurate
template waveforms that are needed for Gravitational Wave (GW) data analysis

Cosmic Web by means of highly nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger type and reaction
diffusion wave mechanical descriptions. The construction of these wave
mechanical models of the structure formation is achieved by introducing the
Fisher information measure and its comparison with a highly nonlinear term
called the quantum potential in the wave equations. Strikingly, the comparison
of the nonlinear term and the Fisher information measure provides a dynamical
distinction between lack of self-organization and self-organization in the
dynamical evolution of the cosmic components. Mathematically equivalent to the
standard cosmic fluid equations, these approaches make it possible to follow
the evolution of the matter distribution even into the highly nonlinear regime
by circumventing singularities. In addition, these wave formalisms are extended
to two-fluid descriptions of the coupled dark matter and baryon matter
distributions in the linear regime, in the Einstein de Sitter Universe (EdS) to
construct toy models of the cosmic components in this relatively simple

fully analytical results for the dark matter and baryon distributions are

the decay heat of short-lived nuclides (e.g. 26Al, 60Fe), was the main heat
source driving differentiation and metamorphism, thermal modeling of small
bodies is of utmost importance to set individual meteorite age data into the
general context of the thermal evolution of their parent bodies, and to derive
general conclusions about the nature of planetary building blocks in the early
solar system. As a general result, modelling easily explains that iron
meteorites are older than chondrites, as early formed planetesimals experienced
a higher concentration of short-lived nuclides and more severe heating.
However, core formation processes may also extend to 10 Ma after formation of
Calcium-Aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs). A general effect of the porous nature
of the starting material is that relatively small bodies (< few km) will also
differentiate if they form within 2 Ma after CAIs. A particular interesting
feature to be explored is the possibility that some chondrites may derive from
the outer undifferentiated layers of asteroids that are differentiated in their
interiors. This could explain the presence of remnant magnetization in some
chondrites due to a planetary magnetic field.

$\mathcal{P}$ of probability densities, which are parametrized by functions in
a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, $H$ and show it to be quite rich in the
sense that a broad class of densities on $\mathbb{R}^d$ can be approximated
arbitrarily well in Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence by elements in
$\mathcal{P}$. The main goal of the paper is to estimate an unknown density,
$p_0$ through an element in $\mathcal{P}$. Standard techniques like maximum
likelihood estimation (MLE) or pseudo MLE (based on the method of sieves),
which are based on minimizing the KL divergence between $p_0$ and
$\mathcal{P}$, do not yield practically useful estimators because of their
inability to efficiently handle the log-partition function. Instead, we propose
an estimator, $\hat{p}_n$ based on minimizing the \emph{Fisher divergence},
$J(p_0\Vert p)$ between $p_0$ and $p\in \mathcal{P}$, which involves solving a
simple finite-dimensional linear system. When $p_0\in\mathcal{P}$, we show that
the proposed estimator is consistent, and provide a convergence rate of
$n^{-\min\left\{\frac{2}{3},\frac{2\beta+1}{2\beta+2}\right\}}$ in Fisher
divergence under the smoothness assumption that $\log
p_0\in\mathcal{R}(C^\beta)$ for some $\beta\ge 0$, where $C$ is a certain
Hilbert-Schmidt operator on $H$ and $\mathcal{R}(C^\beta)$ denotes the image of
$C^\beta$. We also investigate the misspecified case of $p_0\notin\mathcal{P}$
and show that $J(p_0\Vert\hat{p}_n)\rightarrow \inf_{p\in\mathcal{P}}J(p_0\Vert
p)$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$, and provide a rate for this convergence under a
similar smoothness condition as above. Through numerical simulations we
demonstrate that the proposed estimator outperforms the non-parametric kernel
density estimator, and that the advantage with the proposed estimator grows as
$d$ increases.

instead the Kirby torus trick. This has the advantage of reducing the point-set
topology in the proof to practically nothing, replacing it by a few basic facts
about smooth surfaces. Uniqueness of smooth structures is proved in the strong
form that every homeomorphism between smooth surfaces is isotopic to a
diffeomorphism.

ordered phases in spinor Bose-Einstein condensates predicted by the mean-field

corrections in the condensate, we demonstrate that the so-called
Coleman-Weinberg mechanism takes place in such a transition, that is, the
transition becomes of the first order by quantum fluctuations. A jump to be
expected in this first-order transition is induced by a correction from density
fluctuations despite a transition between different magnetic properties with
keeping condensation. We exemplify this with an experimentally relevant case
and show that a measurement of a condensate depletion can be utilized to
confirm the first-order transition.

types. It has also been claimed to be a magnetic star by some authors while
others do not detect a magnetic field. We aimed at checking for the presence of
a field, characterise it if it exists or provide a firm upper limit of its
strength if it is not detected. If gam Peg is magnetic, it would make an ideal
asteroseismic target to test various theoretical scenarios. If it is very
weakly magnetic, it would be the first observation of an extension of Vega-like
fields to early B stars. Finally, if it is not magnetic and we can provide a
very low upper limit on its non-detected field, it would make an important
result for stellar evolution models. We acquired high resolution, high
signal-to-noise spectropolarimetric Narval data at TBL. We also gathered
existing dimaPol@DAO and Musicos@TBL spectropolarimetric data. We analysed the
Narval and Musicos observations using the LSD technique to derive the
longitudinal magnetic field and Zeeman signatures in lines. The longitudinal
field strength was also extracted from the Hbeta line observed with the DAO.
With a Monte Carlo simulation we derived the maximum strength of the field
possibly hosted by gam Peg. We find that no magnetic signatures are visible in
the very high quality spectropolarimetric data. The average longitudinal field
measured in the Narval data is Bl=-0.1+/-0.4 G. We derive a very strict upper
limit of the dipolar field strength of Bpol~40 G. We conclude that gamma Peg is
not magnetic: it does not host a strong stable fossil field as observed in a
fraction of massive stars, nor a very weak Vega-like field. There is therefore
no evidence that Vega-like fields exist in B stars contrary to the predictions
by fossil field dichotomy scenarios. These scenarios should thus be revised.
Our results also provide strong constraints for stellar evolution models.

developed to study the construction of random matrix from the viewpoint of
feature selection, rather than of traditional distance preservation. This
yields a somewhat surprising theoretical result, that is, the sparse random
matrix with exactly one nonzero element per column, can present better feature
selection performance than other more dense matrices, if the projection
dimension is sufficiently large (namely, not much smaller than the number of
feature elements); otherwise, it will perform comparably to others. For random

complexity and performance, which is widely confirmed with the classification

tensor components of the nematic order parameter in terms of temperature, the
distortion and stress tensors, and the initial nematic order. These equations
are amenable to simple numerical calculations, which are used to characterize
the low-temperature soft regime. We find a peculiar phase diagram, in terms of
temperature and the diagonal component of the distortion tensor along the
stretching direction, with first- and second-order transitions to the soft
phase, and the prediction of tricritical points. This behavior is not
qualitatively changed if we use different values of the initial nematic order

up to 5 TeV dijet mass using jets reconstructed with the anti-kt algorithm for

compared with next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations by NLOJET++
corrected to account for non-perturbative effects. Comparisons with POWHEG
predictions, using a next-to-leading-order matrix element calculation
interfaced to a parton-shower Monte Carlo simulation, are also shown.
Electroweak effects are accounted for in both cases. The quantitative
comparison of data and theoretical predictions obtained using various
parameterizations of the parton distribution functions is performed using a
frequentist method. An example setting a lower limit on the compositeness scale
for a model of contact interactions is presented, showing that the unfolded
results can be used to constrain contributions to dijet production beyond that
predicted by the Standard Model.

this inequality also provides an upper bound of the estimation error of the
estimated parameter vector. These are new results and they generalize the
econometrics and statistics literature. Next, we use the non-asymptotic results
to show that the excess loss of our estimator is asymptotically of the same
order as that of the oracle. If the target is linear we give sufficient
conditions for consistency of the estimated parameter vector. Next, we briefly
discuss how a thresholded version of our estimator can be used to perform
consistent variable selection. We give two examples of loss functions covered

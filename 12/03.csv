cosmological model with black holes as the only sources of the gravitational
field. The model we consider is an exact solution of the constraint equations
and represents a vacuum universe with a number of black holes placed on a
spatial slice of $S^3$ topology considered at the moment of its largest
expansion when the black holes are momentary at rest. We explain how and under
what conditions the FLRW metric arises as the continuum limit when the number
of black holes contained in the model goes to infinity. We also dicuss the
relation between the effective cosmological parameters of the model, inferred
from the large scale geometry of the spacetime, and the masses of individual
black holes. In particular, we prove an estimate for the difference between the
total effective mass of the system and the sum of the masses of all black
holes, thus quantifying the effects of the inhomogeneities in the matter
distribution or the cosmological backreaction.

al. (2012), we re-investigate this correlation with additional sources of
black-hole X-ray binaries (BXBs) in hard/quiescent states and low-luminosity
active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs). The new sample includes 29 sets of data from 7
BXBs and 20 LLAGNs, with $P_{\rm jet}$ and $L_{\rm jet}$ being derived from
spectral modeling of the quasi-simultaneous multi-band spectra under the
accretion-jet scenario. Compared to previous works, the range of luminosity is
now enlarged to more than $20$ decades, i.e. from $10^{31}{\rm erg/s}$ to
$10^{52}{\rm erg/s}$, which allows for better constraining of the correlation.
One notable result is that the jets in BXBs and LLAGNs almost follow the same
$P_{\rm jet} - L_{\rm jet}$ correlation that was obtained from blazars and
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The slope indices we derived are $1.03\pm0.01$ for the
whole sample, $0.85\pm0.06$ for BXB subsample, $0.71\pm0.11$ for LLAGN
subsample, and $1.01\pm0.05$ for the LLAGN-blazar subsample, respectively. The
correlation index around unit implies the independence of jet efficiency on the
luminosity or kinetic power. Our results may further support the hypothesis
that similar physical processes exist in the jets of various black hole
systems.

key new ingredient in comparison to previous approaches consists in the use of
regulators which cut off both frequencies and momenta. We incorporate
renormalization effects on both the bosonic and the fermionic propagator,
include higher order bosonic scattering processes, and investigate the

ratio $\Delta/T_{\rm c}=2.7(3)$ becomes less sensitive to the relative cutoff

  The X-ray spectrum is characterized by emission from a multi-temperature
plasma. No evidence for a luminous soft X-ray component was found. Orbital
phase-dependent X-ray photometric variability by $\sim50\%$ occurred without
significant spectral changes. No further periodicity was significant in our

L_X, bol simeq 5e30 erg/s but, based on the Swift observations, the

properties show commonalities with both classes of magnetic and non-magnetic

available market data is explored here. In contemporary whole-sale electricity
markets, real-time prices are typically determined by solving the
network-constrained economic dispatch problem. Under a linear DC model,
locational marginal prices (LMPs) correspond to the Lagrange multipliers of the
linear program involved. The interesting observation here is that the matrix of
spatiotemporally varying LMPs exhibits the following property: Once
premultiplied by the weighted grid Laplacian, it yields a low-rank and sparse
matrix. Leveraging this rich structure, a regularized maximum likelihood
estimator (MLE) is developed to recover the grid Laplacian from the LMPs. The
convex optimization problem formulated includes low rank- and
sparsity-promoting regularizers, and it is solved using a scalable algorithm.
Numerical tests on prices generated for the IEEE 14-bus benchmark provide
encouraging topology recovery results.

pertinent set of 42 irreducible photon-loop diagrams is calculated by using the

constants $\widehat k_1$ and $\widehat k_2$ are included in order to remove the
ultraviolet divergences generated by the photon-loops. Infrared finiteness of
the virtual radiative corrections is achieved by including soft photon
radiation below an energy cut-off $\lambda$. The purely electromagnetic
interaction of the charged pions mediated by one-photon exchange is also taken
into account. The radiative corrections to the total cross section (in the
isospin limit) vary between $+10\%$ close to threshold and about $-1\%$ at a
center-of-mass energy of $7m_\pi$. The largest contribution comes from the
simple one-photon exchange. Radiative corrections to the $\pi^+\pi^-$ and
$\pi^-\pi^-$ mass spectra are studied as well. The Coulomb singularity of the
final-state interaction produces a kink in the dipion mass spectra. The virtual
radiative corrections to elastic $\pi^-\pi^-$ scattering are derived

recovery of sparse signals from a few linear measurements of their bilinear
form. One important question is how many measurements are needed for a stable
reconstruction in the presence of measurement noise. Unlike conventional
compressed sensing for sparse vectors, where convex relaxation via the
$\ell_1$-norm achieves near optimal performance, for compressed sensing of
sparse low-rank matrices, it has been shown recently Oymak et al. that convex
programmings using the nuclear norm and the mixed norm are highly suboptimal
even in the noise-free scenario.
  We propose an alternating minimization algorithm called sparse power
factorization (SPF) for compressed sensing of sparse rank-one matrices. For a
class of signals whose sparse representation coefficients are fast-decaying,
SPF achieves stable recovery of the rank-1 matrix formed by their outer product
and requires number of measurements within a logarithmic factor of the
information-theoretic fundamental limit. For the recovery of general sparse
low-rank matrices, we propose subspace-concatenated SPF (SCSPF), which has
analogous near optimal performance guarantees to SPF in the rank-1 case.
Numerical results show that SPF and SCSPF empirically outperform convex
programmings using the best known combinations of mixed norm and nuclear norm.

hand with a notion of structure, since with no structure on the dependence of
outcomes on baseline covariates complete randomization (no special covariate
balance) is always minimax optimal. Restricting the structure of dependence,
either parametrically or non-parametrically, gives rise to certain covariate
imbalance metrics and optimal designs. This recovers many popular imbalance
metrics and designs previously developed ad hoc, including randomized block
designs, pairwise-matched allocation and rerandomization. We develop a new
design method called kernel allocation based on the optimal design when
structure is expressed by using kernels, which can be parametric or
non-parametric. Relying on modern optimization methods, kernel allocation,
which ensures nearly perfect covariate balance without biasing estimates under
model misspecification, offers sizable advantages in precision and power as
demonstrated in a range of real and synthetic examples. We provide strong

a single data-driven tuning. The distribution of its variance is approximated
by a consistent random subsampling method that is able to cope with the massive

an estimation method that is able to represent the dynamic range concept

newly arriving customers are lost. We prove an if-and-only-if-condition for a

  We discuss several applications, e.g. from inventory theory and reliability

in the literature, e.g. of queueing-inventory processes.
  We investigate further classical loss systems, where due to finite waiting
room loss of customers occurs. In connection with loss of customers due to
blocking by the environment and service interruptions new phenomena arise.
  We further investigate the embedded Markov chains at departure epochs and
show that the behaviour of the embedded Markov chain is often considerably
different from that of the continuous time Markov process. This is different
from the behaviour of the standard M/G/1, where the steady state of the
embedded Markov chain and the continuous time process coincide.
  For exponential queueing systems we show that there is a product form
equilibrium of the embedded Markov chain under rather general conditions. For
systems with non-exponential service times more restrictive constraints are
needed, which we prove by a counter example where the environment represents an
inventory attached to an M/D/1 queue. Such integrated queueing-inventory

the PDW state produces a fully gapped quasiparticle spectrum which explains

of neutrinos exploiting the synergies between effective field theory and
models. The phenomena are first analysed by means of effective operators, which
allow to discuss their phenomenological consequences and to derive estimations
about the mass scale of the heavy particles needed to induce the new
interactions. In a second phase we propose models that realise the effective
operators, allowing us to check the conclusions of effective field theory as
well as to extract new phenomenological features of the scenarios considered.
The text is divided into two parts: in the first one we apply these ideas to an
effective interaction that generates magnetic dipole moments for right-handed
neutrinos, and in the second one we discuss a family of operators that violate
lepton number without quarks, and which can allow for large rates of
neutrinoless double $\beta$ decay and small neutrino masses. The right-handed
neutrino magnetic moments have the potential to show up in many different
scenarios, and the nonobservation of the associated phenomenology allows to
constrain their value, and therefore the associated new physics scale. The
operators discussed in the second part of the text can potentially dominate
neutrinoless double $\beta$ decay and provide signals in the next generation of
experiments; they can be classified according to the chirality of the two
final-state leptons, and induce neutrino mass matrices with a well-defined
hierarchy related to that of the charged lepton masses. In both cases we
provide example models that realise the phenomenology and we discuss their
observability in ongoing and near-future experiments.

show that the SIC existence problem is equivalent to three other, on the face
of it quite different problems. Although it is still not clear whether these
reformulations of the problem will make it more tractable, we believe that the
fact that SICs have these connections to other areas of mathematics is of some
intrinsic interest. Specifically, we reformulate the SIC problem in terms of
(1) Lie groups, (2) Lie algebras and (3) Jordan algebras (the second result
being a greatly strengthened version of one previously obtained by Appleby,
Flammia and Fuchs). The connection between these three reformulations is
non-trivial: It is not easy to demonstrate their equivalence directly, without
appealing to their common equivalence to SIC existence. In the course of our
analysis we obtain a number of other results which may be of some independent
interest.

evolutionary biology. One can differentiate between forward and backward
predictability, where forward predictability measures the likelihood of the
same adaptive trajectory occurring in independent evolutions and backward
predictability measures the likelihood of a particular adaptive path given the
knowledge of starting and final states. Recent studies have attempted to
measure both forward and backward predictability using experimental evolution
in asexual haploid microorganisms. Similar experiments in diploid organisms
have not been conducted. Here we simulate adaptive walks using Fisher's
Geometric Model in haploids and diploids and find that adaptive walks in
diploids are less forward- and more backward-predictable than adaptive walks in
haploids. We argue that the difference is due to the ability of diploids in our
simulations to generate transiently stable polymorphisms and to allow adaptive
mutations of larger phenotypic effect. As stable polymorphisms can be generated
in both haploid and diploid natural populations through a number of mechanisms,
we argue that inferences based on experiments in which adaptive walks proceed
through succession of monomorphic states might miss many of the key features of
adaptation.

robust to heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation of moments up to order four.
As a side effect, one can estimate the proportion of error in the Markowitz

test is given which generalizes Dempster's Covariance Selection test to allow
inference on linear combinations of the precision matrix and the Markowitz

detected by IceCube between 50TeV and 2PeV are inconsistent with those expected
for Galactic sources. The coincidence of the excess,
$E_\nu^2\Phi_\nu=3.6\pm1.2\times10^{-8}(GeV/ cm^2 sr s)$, with the
Waxman-Bahcall (WB) bound, $E_\nu^2\Phi_{WB}=3.4\times10^{-8}(GeV/cm^2 sr s)$,
is probably a clue to the origin of IceCube's neutrinos. The most natural
explanation of this coincidence is that both the neutrino excess and the
ultra-high energy, $>10^{19}$ eV, cosmic-ray (UHECR) flux are produced by the
same population of cosmologically distributed sources, producing CRs, likely
protons, at a similar rate, $E^2 dQ/dE=0.5\times10^{44}(erg/Mpc^3yr)$ (at z=0),
across a wide range of energies, from $10^{15}$ eV to $>10^{20}$ eV, and
residing in environments (such as starburst galaxies) in which CRs of rigidity
$E/Z< 10^{17}$ eV lose much of their energy to pion production. Identification
of the neutrino sources will allow one to identify the UHECR accelerators, to
resolve open questions related to the accelerator models, and to study neutrino
properties (related e.g. to flavor oscillations and coupling to gravity) with
an accuracy many orders of magnitude better than is currently possible. The
most promising method for identifying the sources is by association of a
neutrino with an electromagnetic signal accompanying a transient event
responsible for its generation. The neutrino flux that is produced within the
sources, and that may thus be directly associated with transient events, may be
significantly lower than the total observed neutrino flux, which may be
dominated by neutrino production at the environment in which the sources
reside.

in next-generation sequencing technologies will lead to many more rare variants
association studies. Several statistical methods have been proposed to assess
the effect of rare variants by aggregating information from multiple loci
across a genetic region and testing the association between the phenotype and
aggregated genotype. One limitation of existing methods is that they only look
into the marginal effects of rare variants but do not systematically take into
account effects due to interactions among rare variants and between rare
variants and environmental factors. In this article, we propose the summation
of partition approach (SPA), a robust model-free method that is designed
specifically for detecting both marginal effects and effects due to gene-gene
(G-G) and gene-environmental (G-E) interactions for rare variants association
studies. SPA has three advantages. First, it accounts for the interaction
information and gains considerable power in the presence of unknown and
complicated G-G or G-E interactions. Secondly, it does not sacrifice the
marginal detection power; in the situation when rare variants only have
marginal effects it is comparable with the most competitive method in current
literature. Thirdly, it is easy to extend and can incorporate more complex
interactions; other practitioners and scientists can tailor the procedure to
fit their own study friendly. Our simulation studies show that SPA is
considerably more powerful than many existing methods in the presence of G-G
and G-E interactions.

suggests a completely new quantization scheme where quantum gravity is defined
by quantizing spacetime itself, leading to a dynamical NC spacetime. Therefore
the quantization of emergent gravity is radically different from the
conventional approach trying to quantize a phase space of metric fields. This

stream is red in color, B-V = 0.7, and has a stellar mass of 6x10^8
M$_{\odot}$, which implies a merger ratio of 1:50. Assessment of the stream
morphology suggests that the merger event has a circular radius, R~16 kpc, the
stream formed in ~400 Myr, and the progenitor had a total mass of ~2x10
M$_{\odot}$. Spectroscopy from LBT+MODS1 was used to determine that the blue
overdensity is at the same redshift as NGC5387, consists of young stellar
populations (~10 Myr), is metal-poor (12 + log(O/H) = 8.03), and forming stars
at an enhanced rate (~1-3 M$_{\odot}$/year) given its total stellar mass
(2x10^7 M$_{\odot}$). Several interpretations are posited to explain these
observational data, of which the most likely are (i) that the blue overdensity
is a region of enhanced star formation in the outer disk of NGC5387 induced by
the minor accretion event, and (ii) that the blue overdensity is the progenitor
of the stellar stream undergoing a period of enhanced star formation as a
result of its interaction with NGC5387. Confirmation and theoretical

which leads to Friedel oscillations in the ion-ion potential. In particular,
the Friedel oscillations are much longer-ranged in the direction of the
magnetic field than is the case in the absence of magnetic fields, a factor
that has been neglected in previous studies. These ""Friedel crystals"" have very
anisotropic elastic moduli, with potentially interesting implications for the
Quasi-periodic Oscillations seen in the X-ray flux of magnetars during their
giant flares. We find the minimum energy configuration of ions taking into
account these anisotropic effects and find that, depending on the density,
temperature and magnetic field strength, different lattice structures (fcc, hcp
or bcc oriented in different ways in relation to the magnetic field) are
favored.

attractive mechanism to explain the exponential cut-off at the massive end of
the galaxy stellar mass function (SMF). Semi-analytic models of galaxy
formation in which this form of feedback is assumed to suppress cooling in
haloes where the gas cooling time is large compared to the dynamical time do
indeed achieve a good match to the observed SMF. Furthermore, hydrodynamic
simulations of individual halos in which gas is assumed to accrete onto the
central BH at the Bondi rate have shown that a self-regulating regime is
established in which the BH grows just enough to liberate an amount of energy
comparable to the thermal energy of the halo. However, this process is
efficient at suppressing the growth not only of massive galaxies but also of
galaxies like the Milky Way, leading to disagreement with the observed SMF. The
Bondi accretion rate, however, is inappropriate when the accreting material has
angular momentum. We present an improved accretion model that takes into
account the circularisation and subsequent viscous transport of infalling
material and include it as a ""subgrid"" model in hydrodynamic simulations of the
evolution of halos with a wide range of masses. The resulting accretion rates
are generally low in low mass ($\lsim 10^{11.5} \msun$) halos, but show
outbursts of Eddington-limited accretion during galaxy mergers. During
outbursts these objects strongly resemble quasars. In higher mass haloes, gas
accretion occurs continuously, typically at $~10$ % of the Eddington rate,
which is conducive to the formation of radio jets. The resulting dependence of
the accretion behaviour on halo mass induces a break in the relation between
galaxy stellar mass and halo mass in these simulations that matches
observations.

high-mass side for $\alpha > 1$ and at the low-mass side for $\alpha < 1$.
Large fluctuations require that their distribution is strictly positive, for

with gas moving in the plane of the galaxy and rotating in the same direction
as the stars. However, the gas kinematics is typically far from simple circular
motion. We can classify the observed velocity fields into four different types
of flows, ordered by increasing complexity: (1) circular motion in a disc
(NGC3351); (2) oval motion in the galaxy plane (NGC3627 and NGC4536); (3)
streaming motion superimposed on circular rotation (NGC4501); and (4)
disordered streaming motions (NGC4569 and NGC4579). The H2 velocity dispersion
in the galaxies is usually higher than 50 km/s in the inner 1-2 arcsec radii.
The four galaxies with ordered kinematics have v/sigma < 1 at radii less than
40-80 pc. The radius at which v/sigma = 1 is independent of the type of nuclear
activity. While the low values of v/sigma could be taken as an indication of a
thick disc in the innermost regions of the galaxies, other lines of evidence
(e.g. H2 morphologies and velocity fields) argue for a thin disc interpretation
in the case of NGC3351 and NGC4536. We discuss the implications of the high
values of velocity dispersion for the dynamics of the gaseous disc and suggest
caution when interpreting the velocity dispersion of ionized and warm tracers
as being entirely dynamical. Understanding the nature and role of the velocity
dispersion in the gas dynamics, together with the full 2D information of the
gas, is essential for obtaining accurate black hole masses from gas kinematics.

emitted from the disk, and a new component in gamma-rays is produced by inverse
Compton scattering between the new UV component and pulsar wind. The increase
of X-rays results from the enhancement of injection pulsar wind energy into the
intra-binary shock due to the increase of the stellar wind. We also predict
that the radio pulses may be blocked by the evaporated winds from the disk and
the pulsar is still powered by rotation.

evolution. We model the observed present day mass functions of the young
Galactic Arches and Quintuplet star clusters using our rapid binary evolution
code. We find that shaping of the mass function by stellar wind mass loss
allows us to determine the cluster ages to 3.5$\pm$0.7 Myr and 4.8$\pm$1.1 Myr,

mass function, we find that the most massive stars in both clusters are
rejuvenated products of binary mass transfer, i.e. the massive counterpart of
classical blue straggler stars. This resolves the problem of an apparent age
spread among the most luminous stars exceeding the expected duration of star
formation in these clusters. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to probe
stochastic sampling, which support the idea of the most massive stars being
rejuvenated binary products. We find that the most massive star is expected to

constrain the astrophysical contributions to the extragalactic gamma-ray

analyzed their spectral energy distributions and searched for excess related to
the presence of protoplanetary disks in a homogeneous way. Sensitivity limits
and spatial completeness were also considered. We derive disk fractions as
probed by mid-infrared excess in these regions. The unprecedented size of our
sample allows us to confirm the timescale of disk decay reported in the
literature and to find new trends. The fraction of excess sources increases
systematically if measured at longer wavelengths. Disk percentages derived
using different wavelength ranges should therefore be compared with caution.
The dust probed at 22-24 um evolves slower than that probed at shorter
wavelengths (3.4-12 um). Assuming an exponential decay, we derive a timescale
tau=4.2-5.8 Myr at 22-24 um for primordial disks, compared to 2-3 Myr at
shorter wavelength (3.4-12 um). Primordial disks disappear around 10 Myr,
matching in time a brief increase of the number of 'evolved' disks. The
increase in timescale of excess decay at longer wavelength is compatible with
inside-out disk clearing scenarios. The increased timescale of decay and larger
dispersion in the distribution of disk fractions at 22-24 um suggest that the
inner and outer zones evolve differently, the latter potentially following a
variety of evolutionary paths. The drop of primordial disks and the coincident
rise of evolved disks at 10 Myr are compatible with planet formation theories
suggesting that the disappearance of the gas is immediately followed by the
dynamical stirring of the disk.

consistently demonstrate the existence of a second energy scale, distinct from

scale to the quasiparticle gap due to a competing order, such as the
incommensurate ""checkerboard"" order observed in scanning tunneling microscopy

these experiments are better described by identifying the second energy scale

phenomenological model that allows us to quantitatively describe STM and REXS
experiments and discuss their relation with photoemission spectroscopy. Our

computational model of fN transport, cellular growth, and heterocyst commitment

The model allows us to explore both initial and steady-state heterocyst

lateral inhibition allows us to examine $\Delta$patS, $\Delta$hetN, and
$\Delta$patN phenotypes. We find that $\Delta$patS leads to adjacent
heterocysts of the same generation, while $\Delta$hetN leads to adjacent

must be the runaway thermonuclear explosion of a degenerate carbon-oxygen
stellar core, most likely a white dwarf (WD). However, the specific progenitor
systems of SNe Ia, and the processes that lead to their ignition, have not been
identified. Two broad classes of progenitor binary systems have long been
considered: single-degenerate (SD), in which a WD gains mass from a
non-degenerate star; and double-degenerate (DD), involving the merger of two
WDs. New theoretical work has enriched these possibilities with some
interesting updates and variants. We review the significant recent
observational progress in addressing the progenitor problem. We consider clues
that have emerged from the observed properties of the various proposed
progenitor populations, from studies of their sites, pre- and post-explosion,
from analysis of the explosions themselves, and from the measurement of event
rates. The recent nearby and well-studied event, SN 2011fe, has been
particularly revealing. The observational results are not yet conclusive, and
sometimes prone to competing theoretical interpretations. Nevertheless, it
appears that DD progenitors, long considered the underdog option, could be
behind some, if not all, SNe Ia. We point to some directions that may lead to
future progress.

whenever several messages are equally likely, we break the tie by choosing

unique tool to study accretion, neutron star evolution, and core collapse

bursts on the surface of the neutron star, indicating that the magnetic field
of the neutron star is small. Thus, the young age implies either that neutron

de-magnetized by accretion. Circinus X-1 is a microquasar, creating
relativistic jets which were thought to power the arcminute scale radio nebula

non-thermal synchrotron emission from the forward shock of the supernova

of star formation suitable for use in hydrodynamical simulations of radiative
feedback. Gas in a clump, defined as a region whose density exceeds 10^4 cm^-3,
is converted to stars via the random sampling of the Chabrier IMF. A star
formation efficiency controls the rate of star formation. We have completed a
suite of simulations which follow the evolution of accretion-fed clumps with
initial masses ranging from 0 to 10^5 M_sol and accretion rates ranging from
10^-5 to 10^-1 M_sol yr^-1. The stellar content is tracked over time which
allows the aggregate luminosity, ionizing photon rate, number of stars, and
star formation rate (SFR) to be determined. For a fiducial clump of 10^4 M_sol,
the luminosity is ~4x10^6 L_sol with a SFR of roughly 3x10^-3 M_sol yr^-1. We
identify two regimes in our model. The accretion-dominated regime obtains the
majority of its gas through accretion and is characterized by an increasing SFR
while the reservoir-dominated regime has the majority of its mass present in
the initial clump with a decreasing SFR. We show that our model can reproduce
the expected number of O stars, which dominate the radiative output of the
cluster. We find a nearly linear relationship between SFR and mass as seen in
observations. We conclude that our model is an accurate and straightforward way
to represent the output of clusters in hydrodynamical simulations with
radiative feedback.

polarization correlation experiments (SPCE) is considered to be one of the
biggest mysteries of Nature and is called quantum nonlocality. In this paper we
show once again that this conclusion is based on imprecise terminology and on
the lack of understanding of probabilistic models used in various proofs of
Bell and CHSH theorems. These models are inconsistent with experimental
protocols used in SPCE. This is the only reason why Bell and CHSH inequalities
are violated. A probabilistic non-signalling description of SPCE, consistent
with quantum predictions, is possible and it depends explicitly on the context
of each experiment. It is also deterministic in the sense that the outcome is
determined by supplementary local parameters describing both a physical signals
and measuring instruments. The existence of such description gives additional
arguments that quantum theory is emergent from some more detailed theory
respecting causality and local determinism. If quantum theory is emergent then
there exist perhaps some fine structures in time-series of experimental data
which were not predicted by quantum theory. In this paper we explain how a
systematic search for such fine structures can be done. If such reproducible
fine structures were found it would show that quantum theory is not predictably
complete what would be a major discovery.

parameters of galaxies. The optical spectra of galaxies are highly convoluted
with continuum and lines which are potentially sensitive to different physical
parameters. Defining the wavelength regions of interest is therefore an
important question. In this work, we identify informative wavelength regions in
a single-burst stellar populations model by using the CUR Matrix Decomposition.
Simulating the Lick/IDS spectrograph configuration, we recover the widely used
Dn(4000), Hbeta, and HdeltaA to be most informative. Simulating the SDSS
spectrograph configuration with a wavelength range 3450-8350 Angstrom and a
model-limited spectral resolution of 3 Angstrom, the most informative regions
are: first region-the 4000 Angstrom break and the Hdelta line; second
region-the Fe-like indices; third region-the Hbeta line; fourth region-the G
band and the Hgamma line. A Principal Component Analysis on the first region
shows that the first eigenspectrum tells primarily the stellar age, the second
eigenspectrum is related to the age-metallicity degeneracy, and the third
eigenspectrum shows an anti-correlation between the strengths of the Balmer and
the Ca K and H absorptions. The regions can be used to determine the stellar
age and metallicity in early-type galaxies which have solar abundance ratios,
no dust, and a single-burst star formation history. The region identification
method can be applied to any set of spectra of the user's interest, so that we
eliminate the need for a common, fixed-resolution index system. We discuss
future directions in extending the current analysis to late-type galaxies.

Milky Way is investigated using 13CO data from the FCRAO Galactic Plane Surveys
and the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS) of 1.1 mm dust continuum emission.
A sample of 860 compact dust sources are selected from the BGPS catalog and
kinematically linked to 344 clouds of extended (>3') 13CO J=1-0 emission. Gas
masses are tabulated for the full dust source and subregions within the dust
sources with mass surface densities greater than 200 M_solar/pc^2, which are
assumed to be regions of enhanced volume density. Masses of the parent GMCs are
calculated assuming optically thin 13CO J=1-0 emission and LTE conditions. The
mean fractional mass of dust sources to host GMC mass is 0.11 (-0.06, +0.12).
The high column density subregions comprise 0.07 (-0.05, +0.13) of the mass of
the cloud. Owing to our assumptions, these values are upper limits to the true
mass fractions. The fractional mass of dense gas is independent of GMC mass and
gas surface density. The low dense gas mass fraction suggests that the
formation of dense structures within GMCs is the primary bottleneck for star
formation. The distribution of velocity differences between the dense gas and
the low density material along the line of sight is also examined. We find a
strong, centrally peaked distribution centered on zero velocity displacement.
This distribution of velocity differences is modeled with radially converging
flows towards the dense gas position that are randomly oriented with respect to
the observed line of sight. These models constrain the infall velocities to be
2-4 km/s for various flow configurations.

allow us to give intuitive physical interpretations of the dynamics of the

Here we extend the classical finite mixture regression model to incorporate
functional predictors by taking a wavelet-based approach in which we represent
both the functional predictors and the component-specific coefficient functions
in terms of an appropriate wavelet basis. In the wavelet representation of the
model, the coefficients corresponding to the functional covariates become the
predictors. In this setting, we typically have many more predictors than
observations. Hence we use a lasso-type penalization to perform variable
selection and estimation. We also consider an adaptive version of our
wavelet-based model. We discuss the specification of the model, provide a
fitting algorithm, and apply and evaluate our method using both simulations and
a real data set from a study of the relationship between cognitive ability and
diffusion tensor imaging measures in subjects with multiple sclerosis.

proposed. A single-leader multiple-follower Stackelberg game is then studied to
model the interactions between the CPS and a number of energy consumers (ECs),
and to find optimal distributed solutions for the optimization problem based on
the system model. The CPS is considered as a leader seeking to minimize its
total cost of buying energy from the ECs, and the ECs are the followers who
decide on how much energy they will sell to the CPS for maximizing their
utilities. It is shown that the game, which can be implemented distributedly,
possesses a socially optimal solution, in which the benefits-sum to all
consumers is maximized, as the total cost to the CPS is minimized. Numerical
analysis confirms the effectiveness of the game.

distances in many Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). We use 3D relativistic MHD
(RMHD) simulations to study the propagation of Poynting flux-driven jets in
AGN. These jets are assumed already being launched from the vicinity ($\sim
10^3$ gravitational radii) of supermassive black holes. Jet injections are
characterized by a model described in Li et al. (2006) and we follow the
propagation of these jets to ~ parsec scales. We find that these
current-carrying jets are always collimated and mildly relativistic. When
$\alpha$, the ratio of toroidal-to-poloidal magnetic flux injection, is large
the jet is subject to non-axisymmetric current-driven instabilities (CDI) which
lead to substantial dissipation and reduced jet speed. However, even with the
presence of instabilities, the jet is not disrupted and will continue to
propagate to large distances. We suggest that the relatively weak impact by the
instability is due to the nature of the instability being convective and the
fact that the jet magnetic fields are rapidly evolving on Alfv\'enic timescale.
We present the detailed jet properties and show that far from the jet launching
region, a substantial amount of magnetic energy has been transformed into
kinetic energy and thermal energy, producing a jet magnetization number $\sigma
< 1$. In addition, we have also studied the effects of a gas pressure supported
""disk"" surrounding the injection region and qualitatively similar global jet
behaviors were observed. We stress that jet collimation, CDIs, and the
subsequent energy transitions are intrinsic features of current-carrying jets.

chiral low energy constants of the pion-nucleon Lagrangian are determined. When
just considering the central values of the fit results from covariant baryon
chiral perturbation theory using extended-on-mass-shell scheme, it is found
that these bounds are well respected numerically both at O(p^3) and O(p^4)
level. Nevertheless, when taking the errors into account, only the O(p^4)
bounds are obeyed in the full error interval, while the bounds on O(p^3) fits
are slightly violated. If one disregards loop contributions, the bounds always
fail in certain regions of R. Thus, at a given chiral order these terms are not
numerically negligible and one needs to consider all possible contributions,
i.e., both tree-level and loop diagrams. We have provided the constraints for
special points in R where the bounds are nearly optimal in terms of just a few
chiral couplings, which can be easily implemented and employed to constrain

the discovery of cometary activity in Don Quixote based on thermal-infrared
observations made with the Spitzer Space Telescope in its 3.6 and 4.5 {\mu}m
bands. Our observations clearly show the presence of a coma and a tail in the
4.5 {\mu}m but not in the 3.6 {\mu}m band, which is consistent with molecular
band emission from CO2. Thermal modeling of the combined photometric data on
Don Quixote reveals a diameter of 18.4 (-0.4/+0.3) km and an albedo of 0.03
(-0.01/+0.02), which confirms Don Quixote to be the third-largest known NEO. We
derive an upper limit on the dust production rate of 1.9 kg s^-1 and derive a
CO2 gas production rate of (1.1+-0.1)10^26 molecules s^-1. Spitzer IRS
spectroscopic observations indicate the presence of fine-grained silicates,
perhaps pyroxene rich, on the surface of Don Quixote. Our discovery suggests
that CO2 can be present in near-Earth space over a long time. The presence of
CO2 might also explain that Don Quixote's cometary nature remained hidden for
nearly three decades.

phase transition phenomena have been discovered. Firstly, we discuss the
behavior of the specific heat and the inverse of the isothermal
compressibility. It is shown that there are striking differences in Hawking
temperature and phase structure between black holes with conformal anomaly and
those without it. In the case with conformal anomaly, there exists local
minimum temperature corresponding to the phase transition point. Phase
transitions take place not only from an unstable large black hole to a locally
stable medium black hole but also from an unstable medium black hole to a
locally stable small black hole. Secondly, we probe in details the dependence
of phase transitions on the choice of parameters. The results show that black
holes with conformal anomaly have much richer phase structure than those
without it. There would be two, only one or no phase transition points
depending on the parameters we have chosen. The corresponding parameter region
are derived both numerically and graphically. Thirdly, geometrothermodynamics
are built up to examine the phase structure we have discovered. It is shown
that Legendre invariant thermodynamic scalar curvature diverges exactly where
the specific heat diverges. Furthermore, critical behaviors are investigated by
calculating the relevant critical exponents. It is proved that these critical
exponents satisfy the thermodynamic scaling laws, leading to the conclusion
that critical exponents and the scaling laws can reserve even when we consider
conformal anomaly.

problem with broad applications, including describing thermal relaxation,
deriving quantum limits on the performance of amplifiers, and exploring quantum
metrology in the presence of noise. The symmetry of the dynamics may reflect a
symmetry of the fundamental laws of nature, a symmetry of a low-energy
effective theory, or it may describe a practical restriction such as the lack
of a reference frame. In this paper, we apply some tools of harmonic analysis
together with ideas from quantum information theory to this problem. The
central idea is to study the decomposition of quantum operations---in
particular, states, measurements and channels---into different modes, which we
call modes of asymmetry. Under symmetric processing, a given mode of the input
is mapped to the corresponding mode of the output, implying that one can only
generate a given output if the input contains all of the necessary modes. By
defining monotones that quantify the asymmetry in a particular mode, we also
derive quantitative constraints on the resources of asymmetry that are required
to simulate a given asymmetric operation. We present applications of our
results for deriving bounds on the probability of success in nondeterministic
state transitions, such as quantum amplification, and a simplified formalism
for studying the degradation of quantum reference frames.

interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and their cognate genomic
sites. Our study is informed by high-throughput in vitro measurements of TF-DNA
binding interactions and by a comprehensive collection of genomic binding
sites. Using an evolutionary model for monomorphic populations evolving on a
fitness landscape, we infer fitness as a function of TF-DNA binding energy for
a collection of 12 yeast TFs, and show that the shape of the predicted fitness
functions is in broad agreement with a simple thermodynamic model of two-state
TF-DNA binding. However, the effective temperature of the model is not always
equal to the physical temperature, indicating selection pressures in addition
to biophysical constraints caused by TF-DNA interactions. We find little
statistical support for the fitness landscape in which each position in the
binding site evolves independently, showing that epistasis is common in
evolution of gene regulation. Finally, by correlating TF-DNA binding energies
with biological properties of the sites or the genes they regulate, we are able
to rule out several scenarios of site-specific selection, under which binding
sites of the same TF would experience a spectrum of selection pressures
depending on their position in the genome. These findings argue for the
existence of universal fitness landscapes which shape evolution of all sites

multi-market into the evolutionary minority game, we investigate the effects of
investor beliefs on the evolution of collective behaviors and asset prices.
When there exists another investment opportunity, market confidence, including
overconfidence and under-confidence, is not always good or bad for investment.
The roles of market confidence is closely related to market impact. For low
market impact, overconfidence in a particular asset makes an investor become
insensitive to losses and a delayed strategy adjustment leads to a decline in
wealth, and thereafter, one's runaway from the market. For high market impact,
under-confidence in a particular asset makes an investor over-sensitive to
losses and one's too frequent strategy adjustment leads to a large fluctuation
in asset prices, and thereafter, a decrease in the number of agents. At an
intermediate market impact, the phase transition occurs. No matter what the
market impact is, an equilibrium between different markets exists, which is
reflected in the occurrence of similar price fluctuations in different markets.
A theoretical analysis indicates that such an equilibrium results from the
coupled effects of strategy updating and shift in investment. The runaway of
the agents trading a specific asset will lead to a decline in the asset price
volatility and such a decline will be inhibited by the clustering of the
strategies. A uniform strategy distribution will lead to a large fluctuation in
asset prices and such a fluctuation will be suppressed by the decrease in the
number of agents in the market. A functional relationship between the price
fluctuations and the numbers of agents is found.

By means of analytical arguments as well as extensive computer simulations, we
demonstrate that the heterogeneity in infection rate can either impede or
accelerate the epidemic spreading, which depends on the amount of vaccinated
individuals introduced in the population as well as the contact pattern among
the individuals. Remarkably, as long as the individuals with different
capability of acquiring the disease interact with unequal frequency, there
always exist a cross point for the fraction of vaccinated, below which the
diversity of infection rate hinders the epidemic spreading and above which
expedites it. The overall results are robust to the SVIR dynamics defined on
different population models; the possible applications of the results are
discussed.

Both putative activity (within $\sim$ few $\times$ Myr) connected to the
Galactic center super-massive black hole and, alternatively, nuclear star
formation have been claimed as the energising source of the Bubbles. Likewise,
both inverse-Compton emission by non-thermal electrons (`leptonic' models) and
collisions between non-thermal protons and gas (`hadronic' models) have been
advanced as the process supplying the Bubbles' \gamma -ray emission. An issue
for any steady state hadronic model is that the very low density of the
Bubbles' plasma seems to require that they accumulate protons over a multi-Gyr
timescale, much longer than other natural timescales occurring in the problem.
Here we present a hadronic model where the timescale for generating the
Bubbles' hadronic \gamma -ray emission is $\sim$ few $\times 10^8$ years. Our
model invokes collapse of the Bubbles' thermally-unstable plasma, leading to an
accumulation of cosmic rays and magnetic field into localised, warm ($\sim
10^4$ K), and likely filamentary condensations of higher density gas. Under the
condition that these filaments are supported by non-thermal pressure, we can
predict the hadronic emission from the Bubbles to be $L_\gamma \simeq 2 \times

a pathology that singularities happen at a star surface. We suggest that the

forces near the (surface) singularity modify the effective equation of state of
the particles or make the surface be unstable depending on its matter contents.
The geodesic deviation equations take after the Hooke's law, where its
frequency-squared is proportional to the scalar curvature at the surface. For a
positive curvature, a particle collides with a probing wall more often and
increases the pressure. With the increased pressure, the surface is no longer
singular. For a negative curvature, the matters around the surface experience
repulsions with infinite accelerations. Therefore, the EiBI gravity is saved
from the pathology of surface singularity.

are distributed across the system, but most densely concentrated in the
$\sim$kpc-long shock region. Their spectra neatly divide them into narrow- and
and broad-line emitters, and we decompose the latter into three or more
emission peaks corresponding to spatial elements discernible in HST imaging.
The emission line ratios of the two populations of H{\alpha}-emitters confirm
their nature as H II regions (90% of the sample) or molecular gas heated by a
shock-front propagating at $\lesssim$300 km/s. Their redshift distribution
reveals interesting three-dimensional structure with respect to gas-phase
baryons, with no H II regions associated with shocked gas, no shocked regions
in the intruder galaxy NGC 7318B, and a sharp boundary between shocks and star
formation. We conclude that star formation is inhibited substantially, if not
entirely, in the shock region. Attributing those H II regions projected against
the shock to the intruder, we find a lopsided distribution of star formation in
this galaxy, reminiscent of pile-up regions in models of interacting galaxies.
The H{\alpha} luminosities imply mass outputs, star formation rates, and
efficiencies similar to nearby star-forming regions. Two large knots are an
exception to this, being comparable in stellar output to the prolific 30
Doradus region. We also examine Stephan's Quintet in the context of compact
galaxy group evolution, as a paradigm for intermittent star formation histories
in the presence of a rich, X-ray emitting intra-group medium.

the search for high-reflectivity and reproducible crystals, and the development
of a method to accurately orient and fix the thousands of crystals constituting
a lens. In this paper we focus on the second topic. We used our dedicated X-ray

and precise model systems in which to assess proposed generalizations of
statistical mechanics. The known association of chaotic dynamics with the
structure of Boltzmann--Gibbs (BG) statistical mechanics has suggested the
potential verification of these generalizations at the onset of chaos, when the
only Lyapunov exponent vanishes and ergodic and mixing properties cease to
hold. There are three well-known routes to chaos in these deterministic
dissipative systems, period-doubling, quasi-periodicity and intermittency,
which provide the setting in which to explore the limit of validity of the
standard BG structure. It has been shown that there is a rich and intricate
behavior for both the dynamics within and towards the attractors at the onset
of chaos and that these two kinds of properties are linked via generalized
statistical-mechanical expressions. Amongst the topics presented are: (i)
permanently growing sensitivity fluctuations and their infinite family of
generalized Pesin identities; (ii) the emergence of statistical-mechanical
structures in the dynamics along the routes to chaos; (iii) dynamical
hierarchies with modular organization; and (iv) limit distributions of sums of
deterministic variables. The occurrence of generalized entropy properties in
condensed-matter physical systems is illustrated by considering critical
fluctuations, localization transition and glass formation. We complete our
presentation with the description of the manifestations of the dynamics at the
transitions to chaos in various kinds of complex systems, such as, frequency

  Improvement and Cost Reduction","30 pages, 9 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques have been recently
advanced to tremendously improve the performance of wireless communication
networks. However, the use of very large antenna arrays at the base stations
(BSs) brings new issues, such as the significantly increased hardware and
signal processing costs. In order to reap the enormous gain of massive MIMO and
yet reduce its cost to an affordable level, this paper proposes a novel system
design by integrating an electromagnetic (EM) lens with the large antenna
array, termed the EM-lens enabled MIMO. The EM lens has the capability of
focusing the power of an incident wave to a small area of the antenna array,
while the location of the focal area varies with the angle of arrival (AoA) of
the wave. Therefore, in practical scenarios where the arriving signals from
geographically separated users have different AoAs, the EM-lens enabled system
provides two new benefits, namely energy focusing and spatial interference
rejection. By taking into account the effects of imperfect channel estimation
via pilot-assisted training, in this paper we analytically show that the
average received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in both the single-user and
multiuser uplink transmissions can be strictly improved by the EM-lens enabled
system. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed design makes it possible
to considerably reduce the hardware and signal processing costs with only
slight degradations in performance. To this end, two complexity/cost reduction
schemes are proposed, which are small-MIMO processing with parallel receiver
filtering applied over subgroups of antennas to reduce the computational
complexity, and channel covariance based antenna selection to reduce the
required number of radio frequency (RF) chains. Numerical results are provided
to corroborate our analysis.

programming methods have been used with great success in deriving approximation
algorithms. The capacity-constrained generalizations, such as capacitated
facility location (CFL) and lower-bounded facility location (LBFL), have proved
notorious as far as LP-based approximation is concerned: while there are
local-search-based constant-factor approximations, there is no known linear
relaxation with constant integrality gap. According to Williamson and Shmoys
devising a relaxation-based approximation for \cfl\ is among the top 10 open
problems in approximation algorithms.
  This paper advances significantly the state-of-the-art on the effectiveness
of linear programming for capacity-constrained facility location through a host
of impossibility results for both CFL and LBFL. We show that the relaxations
obtained from the natural LP at $\Omega(n)$ levels of the Sherali-Adams
hierarchy have an unbounded gap, partially answering an open question of
\cite{LiS13, AnBS13}. Here, $n$ denotes the number of facilities in the

relaxation enriched with the generalized flow-cover valid inequalities
\cite{AardalPW95} has also an unbounded gap. This disproves a long-standing
conjecture of \cite{LeviSS12}. We finally introduce the family of proper
relaxations which generalizes to its logical extreme the classic star
relaxation and captures general configuration-style LPs. We characterize the
behavior of proper relaxations for CFL and LBFL through a sharp threshold
phenomenon.

different frameworks, the Fluid/Gravity correspondence and membrane paradigm.
Recently, it has been discussed that these two theories can be understood as
the same theory if the cutoff surface is placed slightly outside the horizon.
The bulk viscosity is different for these two theories, but it does not
contribute to physics since the fluid becomes incompressible in the near
horizon limit. In the AdS/CFT correspondence, it is known that the fluid
becomes compressible and the bulk viscosity is zero, apart from the near
horizon limit. In this paper, we consider the Fluid/Gravity correspondence in
asymptotically non-AdS geometries. We put the cutoff surface near but at a
finite distance from the horizon. Then, the model becomes the membrane paradigm
with compressible fluid. We show that the bulk viscosity is not negative at
least within the linear response regime. We also discuss the higher derivative
corrections in the stress-energy tensor.

attention and became largely used by statistical agencies and private

calibration allows us to handle different types of auxiliary information and
can be shown to encompass as a special cases some of the methods already
proposed in the literature. The theoretical properties of the proposed class of
estimators are derived and discussed, a set of simulation studies is conducted

A rigorous analysis is used to study such behavior, by means of the
construction of a one-parameter family $\{ U^\varepsilon(x;\xi)\}_\xi$ of
approximate stationary solutions and of a linearization of the original system
around an element of this family. We obtain a system consisting in an ODE for
the parameter $\xi$, describing the position of the interface, coupled with a
PDE for the perturbation $v$, defined as the difference $v:=u-U^\varepsilon$.
The key of our analysis are the spectral properties of the linearized operator
around an element of the family $\{ U^\varepsilon \}$: the presence of a first
eigenvalue, small with respect to $\varepsilon$, leads to a metastable behavior
when $\varepsilon \ll 1$.

understand quantum phase transitions in Kondo lattice systems. A particular
focus is on Kondo destruction, which leads to quantum criticality that goes
beyond the Landau framework of order-parameter fluctuations. This
unconventional quantum criticality has provided an understanding of the unusual
dynamical scaling observed experimentally. It has also predicted a sudden jump
of the Fermi surface and an extra (Kondo destruction) energy scale, both of
which have been verified by systematic experiments. Considerations of Kondo
destruction have in addition yielded a global phase diagram, which has
motivated the current interest in heavy fermion materials with variable
dimensionality or geometrical frustration. Here we summarize these
developments, and discuss some of the ongoing work and open issues. We also
consider the implications of these results for superconductivity. Finaly, we
address the effect of spin-orbit coupling on the global phase diagram, suggest
that SmB6 under pressure may display unconventional superconductivity in the
transition regime between a Kondo insulator phase and an antiferroamgnetic
metal phase, and argue that the interfaces of heavy-fermion heterostructures

spectral coverage from the ultraviolet to the far infrared. We then analyzed
the multiwavelength properties of this 90$\mu$m selected sample of galaxies.
For galaxies without known spectroscopic redshifts we computed photometric
redshifts using the codes Photometric Analysis for Redshift Estimate (Le PHARE)
and Code Investigating GALaxy Emission (CIGALE), tested these photometric
redshifts using spectroscopic redshifts, and compared the performances of both
codes. To test the reliability of parameters obtained by fitting spectral
energy distributions, a mock cataloge was generated. We built a large
multiwavelength catalog of more than 500 ADF-S galaxies. We successfully fitted
Spectral Energy Distributions of 186 galaxies with $\rm{\chi^2_{min}<4}$, and
analyzed the output parameters of the fits. We conclude that our sample
consists mostly of nearby actively star-forming galaxies, and all our galaxies
have a relatively high metallicity. We estimated photometric redshifts for 113
galaxies from the whole ADF-S sample. Comparing the performance of Le PHARE and
CIGALE, we found that CIGALE gives more reliable redshift estimates for our
galaxies, which implies that including the IR photometry allows for substantial
improvement of photometric redshift estimation.

SNRs to Earth accompanied by the Vela pulsar and its pulsar wind nebula (PWN)
Vela X. The Vela SNR is one of the most studied remnants and it benefits from
precise estimates of various physical parameters such as distance and age.
Therefore, it is a perfect object for a detailed study of physical processes in
SNRs. The Vela SNR expands into the highly inhomogeneous cloudy interstellar
medium (ISM) and its dynamics is determined by the heating and evaporation of
ISM clouds. It features an asymmetrical X-ray morphology which is explained by
the expansion into two media with different densities. This could occur if the
progenitor of the Vela SNR exploded close to the edge of the stellar wind
bubble of the nearby Wolf-Rayet star $\gamma^2$Velorum and hence one part of
the remnant expands into the bubble. The interaction of the ejecta and the main
shock of the remnant with ISM clouds causes formation of secondary shocks at
which additional particle acceleration takes place. This may lead to the close
to uniform distribution of relativistic particles inside the remnant. We
calculate the synchrotron radio emission within the framework of the new
hydrodynamical model which assumes the supernova explosion at the edge of the

total radio flux from the remnant and the complicated radio morphology of the

we design a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF) where the discrete mode is

then used to compute, recursively in time, smoothed estimates of complete data

The performance of the method is illustrated in simulations and on a

  Model States: An Illustration for the Triangular-Lattice Antiferromagnet in

ground- and excited-state properties of many different types of frustrated and
unfrustrated quantum spin systems. A common feature in the application of the
CCM is to rotate the local spin axes of the (often classical) model state so
that (notationally only) the spins all appear to point in the downwards
$z$-direction. Hitherto, we remark that only coplanar model states have been
used because they do not lead to imaginary terms in the new Hamiltonian. By
contrast, non-coplanar ""three-dimensional"" (3D) model states can lead to
imaginary terms in the new Hamiltonian after rotation. In principle, however,
macroscopic quantities predicted by the CCM (such as the ground-state energy
and order parameter) should still be real (even though the Hamiltonian may be
complex) because the transformations of local spin axes are unitary. Here we
explain how we may use such 3D model states for the CCM and how we may solve
for the (now possibly complex) CCM correlation coefficients. We present results
for the spin-half triangular-lattice antiferromagnet in an external magnetic
field. We use both coplanar model states and a single 3D non-coplanar model
state. We calculate the ground-state energy and the lattice magnetisation as a
function of the magnetic field strength. We find that the energies of the
coplanar states lie lower than that of the non-coplanar state for all values of
the external field, as seen in other approximate studies for this model. We
find that the non-coplanar state does not detect the well-known spin plateau
occurring in this model, although (as seen before) it is clearly observed for
the coplanar model states using the CCM. These results are an excellent initial
validation of the new approach for the application of the CCM using 3D model
states.

when collimated outflows from a protostar interact with the surrounding dense
gas. They have many similarities to supernova remnants which are interacting
with molecular clouds. 1720-MHz OH masers have been identified towards a number
of interacting supernova remnants. Observations and models indicate that these
masers are shock excited and are produced behind C-type shocks. If conditions
behind the shock fronts of Herbig-Haro objects are similarly able to support
1720-MHz OH masers they could be a useful diagnostic tool for star formation.
We therefore searched for 1720-MHz OH maser emission towards a sample of 97

OH lines in emission in 17 of them, but neither their spectral signature nor
follow-up observations with the Very Large Array showed any conclusive evidence

Herbig-Haro shocks more closely and conclude that despite the overall
similarities to supernova remnants, the conditions required for maser emission,

been observed by the $Swift$ satellite in the X-ray afterglows of gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs). Here, we present a detailed analysis on the fall back accretion
process to explain the intense flare phase in the very early X-ray afterglow
light curves. To reproduce the afterglow at late times, we resort to the
external shock by engaging energy injections. By applying our model to GRBs
080810, 081028 and 091029, we show that their X-ray afterglow light curves can
be reproduced well. We then apply our model to the ultra-long $Swift$ GRB
111209A, which is the longest burst ever observed. The very early X-ray
afterglow of GRB 111209A showed many interesting features, such as a
significant bump observed at around 2000 s after the $Swift$/BAT trigger. We
assume two constant energy injection processes in our model. These can explain
the observed plateau at X-ray wavelength in the relatively early stage
($8.0\times10^{3}$ s) and a second X-ray plateau and optical rebrightening at
about $10^{5}$ s. Our analysis supports the scenario that a significant amount
of material may fall back toward the central engine after the prompt phase,
causing an enhanced and long lived mass accretion rate powering a
Poynting-flux-dominated outflow.

which implies emergence of local quantum criticality. Based on this scenario,
we predict the $\omega/T$ scaling behavior near ferromagnetic quantum

be already achieved even for a low Mn concentration. Some experiments have
reported room temperature ferromagnetism (RT-FM) whilst some others only
paramagnetism. When observed, the nature of RT-FM appears to be controversial

performed. We show that the Curie temperatures were largely overestimated
previously, due to the inadequate treatment of both thermal and transverse
fluctuations, and disorder. It appears that the Mn-Mn couplings can not explain
the observed RT-FM. We argue, that this can be attributed to the interaction
between large moments induced in the vicinity of the manganese. This is similar
to the non-magnetic defect induced ferromagnetism reported in oxides,
semiconductors and graphene/graphite.

have slightly sub-solar metallicities, suggesting that they were formed from
pre-enriched material. Using the oxygen abundances derived for each system, we
found that the extended tidal tail of NGC 92 has a flat metallicity
distribution. Although this scenario is consistent with N-body simulations of
interacting systems, where there is gas mixing triggered by the interaction,
archival Halpha Fabry-Perot data cubes of NGC 92 have not shown a velocity

is an important consumer of CPU cycles. The tasks performed to get answers to
""basic"" queries such as locating a point within a geometry hierarchy or
computing accurately the distance to the next boundary can become very
computing intensive for complex detector setups. So far, the existing geometry
algorithms employ mainly scalar optimisation strategies (voxelization, caching)
to reduce their CPU consumption. In this paper, we would like to take a
different approach and investigate how geometry navigation can benefit from the
vector instruction set extensions that are one of the primary source of
performance enhancements on current and future hardware. While on paper, this
form of microparallelism promises increasing performance opportunities,
applying this technology to the highly hierarchical and multiply branched
geometry code is a difficult challenge. We refer to the current work done to
vectorise an important part of the critical navigation algorithms in the ROOT
geometry library. Starting from a short critical discussion about the
programming model, we present the current status and first benchmark results of
the vectorisation of some elementary geometry shape algorithms. On the path
towards a full vector-based geometry navigator, we also investigate the
performance benefits in connecting these elementary functions together to
develop algorithms which are entirely based on the flow of vector-data. To this
end, we discuss core components of a simple vector navigator that is tested and
evaluated on a toy detector setup.

the cosmic repulsion on the motion of both Small and Large MC is also highly
significant, but it is of a different character than in the framework of the

of these fundamentally different approaches to the explanation of the phenomena

the critical cluster varies from $\sim$8000 molecules (radius$ = 4$nm) at 15K
below melting to $\sim$600 molecules (radius$ = 1.7$nm) at 35K below melting.
We use Classical Nucleation Theory (CNT) to estimate the ice-water interfacial
free energy and the nucleation free energy barrier. We obtain an interfacial
free energy of 29(3)mN/m from an extrapolation of our results to the melting
temperature. This value is in good agreement both with experimental
measurements and with previous estimates from computer simulations of
TIP4P-like models. Moreover, we obtain estimates of the nucleation rate from
simulations of the critical cluster at the barrier top. The values we get for
both models agree within statistical error with experimental measurements. At
temperatures higher than 20K below melting we get nucleation rates slower than
the appearance of a critical cluster in all the water of the hydrosphere in the

The FRANTIC algorithms are motivated by compressive sensing; however, unlike
traditional compressive sensing, the measurement design here is constrained by
the network topology and the matrix entries are constrained to be positive
integers. A key component of our design is a new compressive sensing algorithm
SHO-FA-INT that is related to the prior SHO-FA algorithm for compressive
sensing, but unlike SHO-FA, the matrix entries here are drawn from the set of
integers {0, 1, ..., M}. We show that O(k log n /log M) measurements suffice

particle moves about the interior of a bounded domain according to a background
potential, and undergoes elastic collisions at the boundaries. When the
background potential is identically zero, this is the hard-wall billiard model.
Previous results on smooth billiard models (where the hard-wall boundary is
replaced by a steep smooth billiard-like potential) have clarified how the
approximation of a smooth billiard with a hard-wall billiard may be utilized
rigorously. These results are extended here to models with smooth background
potential satisfying some natural conditions. This generalization is then
applied to geometric models of collinear triatomic chemical reactions (the
models are far from integrable $n$-degree of freedom systems with $n\geq2$).
The application demonstrates that the simpler analytical calculations for the
hard-wall system may be used to obtain qualitative information with regard to
the solution structure of the smooth system and to quantitatively assist in
finding solutions of the soft impact system by continuation methods. In
particular, stable periodic triatomic configurations are easily located for the
smooth highly-nonlinear two and three degree of freedom geometric models.

activation protocol in which the \textit{quantumness of correlations} in the
system leads to a unavoidable creation of entanglement with the measurement
apparatus. Using the distillable entanglement, or the relative entropy of
entanglement, as entanglement measure, we show that our approach is equivalent
to the notion of minimal disturbance in a single-particle von Neumann
measurement, also leading to a geometrical approach for its quantification.

to make repeated numerical evaluations tractable. Previous works presented
heuristically guided improvements, e.g., for Horner schemes. The remaining
expression is then further reduced by common subexpression elimination. A
recent approach successfully applied a relatively new algorithm, Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) with UCT as the selection criterion, to find better variable
orderings. Yet, this approach is fit for further improvements since it is
sensitive to the so-called exploration-exploitation constant $C_p$ and the
number of tree updates $N$. In this paper we propose a new selection criterion
called Simulated Annealing UCT (SA-UCT) that has a dynamic
exploration-exploitation parameter, which decreases with the iteration number
$i$ and thus reduces the importance of exploration over time. First, we provide
an intuitive explanation in terms of the exploration-exploitation behavior of
the algorithm. Then, we test our algorithm on three large expressions of
different origins. We observe that SA-UCT widens the interval of good initial
values $C_p$ where best results are achieved. The improvement is large (more
than a tenfold) and facilitates the selection of an appropriate $C_p$.

perception for this type of quasiperiodic lattice is that the self-duality
excludes the appearance of the mobility edge separating localized from extended

numerically the occurrence of the localization-delocalization transition with

high-resolution neutron scattering measurements show that the elastic (-0.02
meV < E < 0.02 meV) (1/2,1/2,1/2) scattering develops strongly below ~275 mK,
and correlates with the opening of a spin gap of ~0.06-0.08 meV over most of
the Brillouin zone. The concomitant low-lying magnetic spin excitations are
weakly dispersive and appear to soften near the (1/2,1/2,1/2) wave vector at 80
mK. The nature of the transition at 275 mK has many characteristics of spin
glass behavior, consistent with ac-susceptibility measurements. The application
of a magnetic field of 0.075 T applied along the [1-10] direction destroys the
(1/2,1/2,1/2) elastic scattering, revealing the fragility of this short-range
ordered ground state. We construct a refined H-T phase diagram for Tb2Ti2O7 and
[1-10] fields which incorporates this frozen spin ice regime and the
antiferromagnetic long-range order previously known to be induced in relatively
large fields. Specific heat measurements on the same crystal reveal a sharp
anomaly at Tc~450 mK and no indication of a transition near ~275 mK. We
conclude that the higher temperature specific heat peak is not related to the
magnetic ordering but is likely a signal of other, nonmagnetic, correlations.

equipped with an action of a finite group $G$, is initiated. We focus on cyclic
actions on $CP^2\# \overline{CP^2}$, and our work shows that even in this
simple setting, the comparison of $G$-minimality in the various categories,
i.e., locally linear, smooth, and symplectic, is already delicate and
interesting. For example, we show that if a symplectic $Z_n$-action on $CP^2\#
\overline{CP^2}$ has an invariant locally linear topological $(-1)$-sphere,
then it must admit an invariant symplectic $(-1)$-sphere, provided that $n=2$
or $n$ is odd. For the case where $n>2$ and even, the same conclusion holds
under a stronger assumption, i.e., the invariant $(-1)$-sphere is smoothly
embedded. Along the way of these proofs we develop certain techniques for
producing embedded invariant $J$-holomorphic two-spheres of self-intersection
$-r$ under a weaker assumption of an invariant smooth $(-r)$-sphere for $r$
relatively small compared with the group order $n$. We then apply the
techniques to give a classification of $G$-Hirzebruch surfaces (i.e.,
Hirzebruch surfaces equipped with a homologically trivial, holomorphic
$G=Z_n$-action) up to orientation-preserving equivariant diffeomorphisms. The
main issue of the classification is to distinguish non-diffeomorphic
$G$-Hirzebruch surfaces which have the same fixed-point set structure. An
interesting discovery is that these non-diffeomorphic $G$-Hirzebruch surfaces
have distinct equivariant Gromov-Taubes invariant, giving the first examples of
such kind. Going back to the original question of $G$-minimality, we show that
for $G=Z_n$, a minimal rational $G$-surface is minimal as a symplectic
$G$-manifold if and only if it is minimal as a smooth $G$-manifold.

understand online user behaviors. Most of the existing work on this subject
usually monitors the global trends, ignoring variation among communities. Since
users from different communities tend to have varying tastes and interests,
capturing community-level temporal change can improve the understanding and
management of social content. Additionally, it can further facilitate the
applications such as community discovery, temporal prediction and online
marketing. However, this kind of extraction becomes challenging due to the
intricate interactions between community and topic, and intractable
computational complexity.
  In this paper, we take a unified solution towards the community-level topic
dynamic extraction. A probabilistic model, CosTot (Community Specific
Topics-over-Time) is proposed to uncover the hidden topics and communities, as
well as capture community-specific temporal dynamics. Specifically, CosTot
considers text, time, and network information simultaneously, and well
discovers the interactions between community and topic over time. We then
discuss the approximate inference implementation to enable scalable computation
of model parameters, especially for large social data. Based on this, the
application layer support for multi-scale temporal analysis and community
exploration is also investigated.
  We conduct extensive experimental studies on a large real microblog dataset,
and demonstrate the superiority of proposed model on tasks of time stamp

photometric redshift catalogs. Our method is based on measuring the fractality
of the projected galaxy distribution, using angular distances, and relies only
on observable quantites. It thus provides a way to test the Cosmological
Principle in a model-independent unbiased way. We have tested our method on
different synthetic inhomogeneous catalogs, and shown that it is capable of
discriminating some fractal models with relatively large fractal dimensions, in
spite of the loss of information due to the radial projection. We have also
studied the influence of the redshift bin width, photometric redshift errors,
bias, non-linear clustering, and surveyed area, on the angular homogeneity
index H2 ({\theta}) in a {\Lambda}CDM cosmology. The level to which an upcoming
galaxy survey will be able to constrain the transition to homogeneity will
depend mainly on the total surveyed area and the compactness of the surveyed
region. In particular, a Dark Energy Survey (DES)-like survey should be able to
easily discriminate certain fractal models with fractal dimensions as large as
D2 = 2.95. We believe that this method will have relevant applications for
upcoming large photometric redshift surveys, such as DES or the Large Synoptic
Survey Telescope (LSST).

redistribute material and angular momentum in discs. We produced a Catalogue

  We traced the contours of rings previously identified by Buta et al. (in

studying the galaxy ellipse fits from S4G's Pipeline 4. We used the galaxy
orientation data obtained by S4G's Pipeline 4 to obtain intrinsic ellipticities
and orientations of rings and the bars.
  ARRAKIS contains data on 724 ringed galaxies in the S4G. The frequency of
resonance rings in the S4G is of 16+-1% and 35+-1% for outer and inner
features, respectively. Outer rings are mostly found in Hubble stages -1<=T<=4.
Inner rings are found in a distribution that covers the range -1<=T<=7. We
confirm that outer rings have two preferred orientations, parallel and
perpendicular to the bar. We confirm a tendency for inner rings to be oriented
parallel to the bar, but we find that a significant fraction (~50%) of them
have random orientations with respect to the bar. These misaligned inner rings
are mostly found in late-type galaxies (T>=4). This may be due to spiral modes
decoupled from the bar dominating the Fourier amplitude spectrum at the radius
of the inner ring.
  We find that the fraction of barred galaxies hosting outer (inner) rings is
~1.7 times (~1.3 times) that in unbarred galaxies. The fact that rings are only
mildly favoured by bars suggests that those in unbarred galaxies either formed
due to weak departures from the axisymmetry of the galactic potential or that
they are born because of bars that have been destroyed after the ring
formation.

either fails to significantly affect the lifetime of an epidemic, or at best,
sustains the epidemic for a lifetime which is polynomial in the number of

where tiles bind to each other if they match on one or more sides, whereas in
cooperative binding, some tiles can bind only if they match on multiple sides.
  Our proof introduces a new programming technique for temperature 1, that

assembling paths between two points A and B cannot be done with less tile types

$f(T)$ gravity for FRW universe along with dust matter, magnetic and torsion
contributions. We evaluate the equation of state and deceleration parameters to
explore the accelerated expansion of the universe. The validity of generalized
second law of thermodynamics for Hubble and event horizons is also investigated
in this scenario. For this purpose, we assume pole-like and power-law forms of
scale factor and construct $f(T)$ models. The graphical behavior of the
cosmological parameters versus smaller values of redshift $z$ represent the
accelerated expansion of the universe. It turns out that the generalized second
law of thermodynamics holds for all values of $z$ with event horizon for
power-law scale factor whereas it holds in a specific range of $z$ with Hubble
horizon for power-law and both horizons in pole-like scale factors.

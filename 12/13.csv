reproduction model and prove results that give bounds on the critical values
$\lambda_f$ for the process to survive from a finite set and $\lambda_e$ for
the existence of a nontrivial stationary distribution. Our first result comes
from a standard block construction, while the second involves a comparison with
the ""generic population model"" of Bramson and Gray (1991). An interesting new
feature of our work is the suggestion that, as in the one dimensional contact
process, edge speeds characterize critical values. We are able to prove the
following for our quadratic contact process when the range is large but suspect
they are true for two dimensional finite range attractive particle systems that
are symmetric with respect to reflection in each axis. There is a speed
$c(\theta)$ for the expansion of the process in each direction. If $c(\theta) >
0$ in all directions, then $\lambda > \lambda_f$, while if at least one speed
is positive, then $\lambda > \lambda_e$. It is a challenging open problem to
show that if some speed is negative, then the system dies out from any finite

conjectured, but never proved, that output states of Gaussian channels
corresponding to coherent input signals are the less noisy ones (in the sense

Specifically we show that every output state of a phase insensitive Gaussian

proof is based on the optimality of coherent states for the minimization of
strictly concave output functionals. Moreover we show that coherent states are

these two forms of emission should result from different, mutually exclusive

simulated maps of emission from both the near-infrared background and 21 cm

strongest anticorrelation originating from times when the universe is half

Cross-correlations can provide redshift information, which the near-infrared
background cannot provide alone. In addition, cross-correlations can help
separate foreground emission from the true high redshift component, making it

plasma by means of high-energy density laser-driven experiments. Our focus is
to create supersonic, self-magnetized turbulence with characteristics that
resemble those found in the interstellar medium (ISM).
  We consider a target made of a spherical core surrounded by a shell made of
denser material. The shell is irradiated by a sequence of laser pulses sending
inward-propagating shocks that convert the inner core into plasma and create
turbulence. In the context of the evolution of the ISM, the shocks play the
role of supernova remnant shocks and the core represents the ionized
interstellar medium. We consider the effects of both pre-existing and
self-generating magnetic fields and study the evolution of the system by means
of two-dimensional numerical simulations.
  We find that the evolution of the turbulent core is generally, subsonic with
rms-Mach number $M_t\approx 0.2$. We observe an isotropic, turbulent velocity
field with an inertial range power spectra of $P(k)\propto k^{-2.3}$. We
account for the effects of self-magnetization and find that the resulting
magnetic field has characteristic strength $\approx 3\times 10^{4}$ G. The
corresponding plasma beta is $\approx 1\times 10^{4}$--$1\times 10^{5}$,
indicating that the magnetic field does not play an important role in the
dynamical evolution of the system.
  The natural extension of this work is to study the system evolution in
three-dimensions, with various laser drive configurations, and targets with
shells and cores of different masses. The latter modification may help to
increase the turbulent intensity and possibly create transonic turbulence. One
of the key challenges is to obtain transonic turbulent conditions in a
quasi-steady state environment.

Minor typos corrected",,"10.1093/mnras/stt2408",,"astro-ph.HE astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  AGN SEDs generally show a turnover at lambda 1000A, implying a maximal
accretion disc (AD) temperature of T_max~50,000K. Massive O stars display a
similar T_max, associated with a sharp rise in a line driven mass loss
Mdot_wind with increasing surface temperature. AGN AD are also characterized by
similar surface gravity to massive O stars. The Mdot_wind of O stars reaches
~10^-5 Msun/year. Since the surface area of AGN AD can be 10^6 larger, the
implied Mdot_wind in AGN AD can reach the accretion rate Mdot. A rise to
Mdot_wind Mdot towards the AD center may therefore set a similar cap of
T_max~50,000K. To explore this idea, we solve the radial structure of an AD
with a mass loss term, and calculate the implied AD emission using the mass
loss term derived from observations of O stars. We find that Mdot_wind becomes
comparable to Mdot typically at a few 10s of GM/c^2. Thus, the standard thin AD
solution is effectively truncated well outside the innermost stable orbit. The
calculated AD SED shows the observed turnover at lambda~1000A, which is weakly
dependent on the AGN luminosity and black hole mass. The AD SED is generally
independent of the black hole spin, due to the large truncation radius.
However, a cold AD (low Mdot, high black hole mass) is predicted to be
windless, and thus its SED should be sensitive to the black hole spin. The
accreted gas may form a hot thick disc with a low radiative efficiency inside
the truncation radius, or a strong line driven outflow, depending on its
ionization state.

spheres (DS) immersed in a continuum dielectric. When an external field is
applied, polarization charges are induced on the surfaces of the spheres and
can be represented as point dipoles placed in the centres of the spheres. When
the DSs are close to each other, the induced charge distributions are distorted
by the electric field of the neighbouring DSs. This is the origin of the
interaction potential between the DSs. The calculation of this energy is very
time consuming, therefore, the DS model cannot be used in molecular
simulations. In this paper, we show that the interaction between the point
dipoles appropriately approximates the interaction of DSs. The polarizable
point dipole model provides better results, but this model is not pair-wise
additive, so it is not that practical in particle simulations.

significantly to the radiation energy density of the Universe. On the other
hand, in the short lived PGB scenario, and since the decay length is shorter
than one parsec, the s-wave annihilation into a PGB and a $CP$ even dark scalar
in the Galactic center might lead to an intense box feature in the gamma-ray

sizable. We also analyze the constraints on these two scenarios from thermal

indirect-detection studies. Current measurements of the antiproton flux at the
top of the atmosphere and theoretical determinations of the secondary
antiproton production in the Galaxy are in good agreement, with no manifest
deviation which could point to an exotic contribution in this channel.
Therefore, antiprotons can be used as a powerful tool for constraining particle
dark matter properties. By using the spectrum of PAMELA data from 50 MV to 180
GV in rigidity, we derive bounds on the dark matter annihilation cross section
(or decay rate, for decaying dark matter) for the whole spectrum of dark matter
annihilation (decay) channels and under different hypotheses of cosmic-rays
transport in the Galaxy and in the heliosphere. For typical models of galactic
propagation, the constraints are significantly strong, setting a lower bound on
the dark matter mass of a ""thermal"" relic at about 50-90 GeV for hadronic
annihilation channels. These bounds are enhanced to about 150 GeV on the dark
matter mass, when large cosmic-rays confinement volumes in the Galaxy are
considered, and are reduced to 4-5 GeV for annihilation to light quarks (no
bound for heavy-quark production) when the confinement volume is small. Bounds
for dark matter lighter than few tens of GeV are due to the low energy part of
the PAMELA spectrum, an energy region where solar modulation is relevant: to
this aim, we have implemented a detailed solution of the transport equation in
the heliosphere, which allowed us not only to extend bounds to light dark
matter, but also to determine the uncertainty on the constraints arising from
solar modulation modeling. Finally, we estimate the impact of soon-to-come
AMS-02 data on the antiproton constraints.

corresponding notion of Restricted Isometry Property for the space of weighted

approximation problem, i.e. we seek structured sparse solutions to
underdetermined systems of linear equations. Many computationally efficient
greedy algorithms have been developed to solve the problem of best $s$-sparse
approximation. The design of all of these algorithms employ a similar template
of exploiting the RIP and computing projections onto the space of sparse
vectors. We present an extension of the Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT)
algorithm to solve the weighted sparse approximation problem. This IHT
extension employs a weighted analogue of the template employed by all greedy
sparse approximation algorithms. Theoretical guarantees are presented and much
of the original analysis remains unchanged and extends quite naturally.
However, not all the theoretical analysis extends. To this end, we identify and
discuss the barrier to extension. Much like IHT, our IHT extension requires
computing a projection onto a non-convex space. However unlike IHT and other
greedy methods which deal with the classical notion of sparsity, no simple
method is known for computing projections onto these weighted sparse spaces.
Therefore we employ a surrogate for the projection and analyze its empirical
performance.

characterize the quantum vacua as a first step towards studying black hole
evaporation in spherical symmetry in loop quantum gravity and compute the
Hawking radiation. We use as quantum space time the recently introduced exact
solution of the quantum Einstein equations in vacuum with spherical symmetry
and consider a spherically symmetric test scalar field propagating on it. The
use of loop quantum gravity techniques in the background space-time naturally
regularizes the matter content, solving one of the main obstacles to back
reaction calculations in more traditional treatments. The discreteness of area
leads to modifications of the quantum vacua, eliminating the trans-Planckian
modes close to the horizon, which in turn eliminates all singularities from
physical quantities, like the expectation value of the stress energy tensor.
Apart from this, the Boulware, Hartle--Hawking and Unruh vacua differ little
from the treatment on a classical space-time. The asymptotic modes near scri
are reproduced very well. We show that the Hawking radiation can be computed,
leading to an expression similar to the conventional one but with a high
frequency cutoff. Since many of the conclusions concern asymptotic behavior,
where the spherical mode of the field behaves in a similar way as higher
multipole modes do, the results can be readily generalized to non spherically
symmetric fields.

the presence of a scalar field whose kinetic term is constructed out from a
linear combination of the metric and the Einstein tensor. The field equations
as well as the energy-momentum tensor are second order in the metric and the
field, therefore the theory belongs to the ones defined by Horndeski. We show
that in the presence of a cosmological term in the action, it is possible to
have a real scalar field in the region outside the event horizon. The solutions
are characterized by a single integration constant, the scalar field vanishes
at the horizon and it contributes to the effective cosmological constant at
infinity. We extend these results to the topological case. The solution is
disconnected from the maximally symmetric AdS background, however, within this
family there exits a gravitational soliton which is everywhere regular. This
soliton is therefore used as a background to define a finite Euclidean action
and to obtain the thermodynamics of the black holes. For a certain region in
the space of parameters, the thermodynamic analysis reveals a critical
temperature at which a Hawking-Page phase transition between the black hole and
the soliton occurs. We extend the solution to arbitrary dimensions grater than
four and show that the presence of a cosmological term in the action allows to
consider the case in which the standard kinetic term for the scalar it's not
present. In such scenario, the solution reduces to an asymptotically flat black
hole.

These models were studied by A. Toom, who gave both a criterion for erosion and
a proof of the stability of homogeneous space-time configurations. Basing
ourselves on these major findings, we prove, for a set of initial conditions,
exponential convergence of the induced processes toward the extremal invariant

decreases exponentially fast as the diameter of the block increases. This upper
bound complements, for dimension 2, a lower bound of the same form obtained for

rely on spacetime symmetries and (2) they properly account for both matter and
gravitational effects. Moreover, they provide simple, exact, operational
expressions for fluxes of gravitational energy and linear and angular momentum.

post-Newtonian (1PN) approximation, and then apply these approximate laws to
the problem of gravitational tidal interactions. We obtain formulas for tidal
heating and tidal torque that agree with the literature, but without resorting
to the use of pseudotensors. We describe the physical mechanism of these tidal
interactions not in the traditional terms of a Newtonian gravitational force,
but in terms of a much simpler and universal mechanism that is an exact,

O(|\xi|^{-\eta}), \quad \text{as } |\xi| \to \infty.$$ We show that this
property holds for any Gibbs measure $\mu$ of Hausdorff dimension greater than
$1/2$ with a natural large deviation assumption on the Gibbs potential. In
particular, we obtain the result for the Hausdorff measure and all Gibbs
measures of dimension greater than $1/2$ on badly approximable numbers, which
extends the constructions of Kaufman and Queff\'elec-Ramar\'e. Our main result
implies that the Fourier-Stieltjes coefficients of the Minkowski's question
mark function decay to $0$ polynomially answering a question of Salem from
1943. As an application of the Davenport-Erd\H{o}s-LeVeque criterion we obtain
an equidistribution theorem for Gibbs measures, which extends in part a recent

extension of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) is presented. The
proposed superpotential is uniquely determined by applying a continuous R and a
Z_2 discrete symmetry, whereas the Kahler potential respects a no-scale-type
SU(54,1)/SU(54)x U(1)_R x Z_2 symmetry too. The inflaton is identified with a
Higgs-like modulus whose the vacuum expectation value controls the
gravitational strength. Thanks to a strong enough coupling (with a parameter cT
involved) between the inflaton and the Ricci scalar curvature, inflation can be
attained even for subplanckian values of the inflaton with cT>76 and the
corresponding effective theory being valid up to the Planck scale. The
inflationary observables turn out to be in agreement with the current data and
the inflaton mass is predicted to be 3x10^13 GeV. At the cost of a relatively
small superpotential coupling constant, the model offers also a resolution to
the mu problem of the MSSM. Supplementing MSSM by three right-handed neutrinos
we show that spontaneously arising couplings between the inflaton and the
particle content of MSSM not only ensure a sufficiently low reheating
temperature but also support a scenario of non-thermal leptogenesis
consistently with the neutrino oscillation parameters for gravitino heavier
than about 10^4 GeV.

$2.8\times 10^4 \text{M}_{\text{sun}}$ for the satellite haloes and restrict
the data to a PAndAS like field. If we include the so-called orphan galaxies in
our analysis, we find that planes with a rms lower than the VTPD are common in
Millennium II. This is partially due to the strongly radially concentrated
distribution of orphan galaxies. Excluding part of the orphan galaxies brings
the radial distributions of Millennium II satellites into better agreement with
the satellite distribution of Andromeda while still producing a significant
fraction of planes with a lower rms than the VTPD. We also find haloes in
Millennium II with an equal or higher number of co-rotating satellites than the
VTPD. This demonstrates that the VTPD is not in conflict with the standard
cosmological framework, although a definite answer of this question might
require higher resolution cosmological simulations that do not have to consider
orphan galaxies. Our results finally show that satellite planes in Millennium

these two pairings are topologically distinguished by their respective orbital
angular momentum projections along the c-axis, $m=\pm 1$ and $m=\pm 2$. The
point nodes of these states act as the monopoles and the anti-monopoles of the
Berry's gauge flux of charge $\pm m$, which are separated in the momentum space
along the $c$ axis. As a result, the Berry's flux through the $ab$ plane equals
$m$. Consequently, the point nodes of $k_z(k_x+i k_y)$ and $(k_x \pm ik_y)^2$
states respectively realize the Weyl and the double-Weyl fermions, with
chemical potential exactly tuned at the Fermi point, due to the charge
conjugation symmetry. These topologically nontrivial point nodes, give rise to
$m$ copies of protected spin degenerate, chirally dispersing surface states on
the $ca$ and the $cb$ planes, which carry surface current, and their energies
vanish at the Fermi arcs. In contrast, a line node acts as the momentum space
vortex loop, and gives rise to the zero energy, dispersionless Andreev bound
states on the surfaces parallel to the plane enclosed by the line node. The
Berry's flux through the $ab$ plane gives rise to anomalous spin Hall and
thermal Hall conductivities, and various magnetoelectric effects. A clear
determination of the bulk invariant can only be achieved by probing the pairing
symmetry via a corner Josephson junction measurement, and Fourier transformed
STM measurements of the Fermi arcs. Therefore, we identify

superpartners (above a TeV), while sfermions and the dark matter can be
parametrically lighter -- leading to a so-called split-spectrum. When combining
this fact with the motivation from fundamental theory for shift-symmetric
scalars (moduli) prior to SUSY breaking, this leads to a non-thermal history
for the early universe. Such a history implies different expectations for the
microscopic properties of dark matter, as well as the possibility of dark
radiation and a cosmic axion background. In this paper we examine how
correlated and mixed isocurvature perturbations are generated in such models,
as well as the connection to dark radiation. WMAP constraints on multiple
correlated isocurvature modes allow up to half of the primordial perturbations
to be isocurvature, contrary to the case of a single isocurvature mode where
perturbations must be dominantly adiabatic. However, such bounds are strongly
prior dependent, and have not been investigated with the latest Planck data. In
this paper we use the example of a SUSY non-thermal history to establish
theoretical priors on cosmological parameters. Of particular interest, we find
that priors on dark radiation are degenerate with those on the total amount of
isocurvature -- they are inversely correlated. Dark radiation is tightly
constrained in the early universe and has been used recently to place stringent
constraints on string-based approaches to beyond the standard model. Our
results suggest such constraints can require more input from theory. Data from
cosmological probes -- such as Planck -- can help guide model building in
models of the MSSM, split-SUSY, and beyond. Our model also demonstrates the
utility of UV models in constructing cosmological priors. (abridged)

measure the projected angular and comoving separations between each group and
the primary strong lensing clusters in each corresponding line of sight. From
these data we measure the distribution of projected angular separations between
the primary strong lensing clusters and uncorrelated large scale structure as
traced by groups. We then compare the observed distribution of angular
separations for our strong lensing selected lines of sight against the
distribution of groups that is predicted for clusters lying along random lines
of sight. There is clear evidence for an excess of structure along the line of
sight at small angular separations ($\theta \leq 6'$) along the strong lensing
selected lines of sight, indicating that uncorrelated structure is a
significant systematic that contributes to producing galaxy clusters with large
cross sections for strong lensing. The prevalence of line-of-sight structure is
one of several biases in strong lensing clusters that can potentially be folded
into cosmological measurements using galaxy cluster samples. These results also
have implications for current and future studies -- such as the Hubble Space
Telescope Frontier Fields -- that make use of massive galaxy cluster lenses as
precision cosmological telescopes; it is essential that the contribution of
line-of-sight structure be carefully accounted for in the strong lens modeling
of the cluster lenses.

of continuity and Euler equations. Brustein and Riotto (2011) conjectured the
equivalence of these systems in the special case where vector perturbations

but to a physically different one with large deviations already in the 1-loop
power spectrum. We show that it is also possible to consistently set to zero
the vector perturbations which strongly constrains the allowed initial
conditions, in particular excluding Gaussian ones such that inclusion of vector
perturbations is inevitable in the cosmological context. In addition we derive
nonlinear equations for the gravitational slip and tensor perturbations,

topological insulating phases, which we classify in the presence of cubic
symmetry. In particular, depending on the choice of our model parameters, we
find a strong topological insulator phase with a band inversion at the
$\mathrm{X}$ point, modeling the situation potentially realized in SmB$_6$, and
a topological crystalline insulator phase with trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ indices
but nonvanishing mirror Chern numbers. Using the Kotliar-Ruckenstein
slave-boson scheme, we further demonstrate how increasing interactions among
$f$ electrons can lead to topological phase transitions. Remarkably, for fixed
band parameters, the $f$-orbital occupation number at the topological
transitions is essentially independent of the interaction strength, thus
yielding a robust criterion to discriminate between different phases.

involved (1) HI 21cm absorption studies of a large DLA sample, (2) VLBI studies
to measure the low-frequency quasar core fractions, and (3) optical/ultraviolet
spectroscopy to determine DLA metallicities and velocity widths.
  Including literature data, our sample consists of 37 DLAs with estimates of
the spin temperature $T_s$ and the covering factor. We find a strong $4\sigma$)
difference between the $T_s$ distributions in high-z (z>2.4) and low-z (z<2.4)
DLA samples. The high-z sample contains more systems with high $T_s$ values,
$\gtrsim 1000$ K. The $T_s$ distributions in DLAs and the Galaxy are also
clearly (~$6\sigma$) different, with more high-$T_s$ sightlines in DLAs than in
the Milky Way. The high $T_s$ values in the high-z DLAs of our sample arise due
to low fractions of the cold neutral medium.
  For 29 DLAs with metallicity [Z/H] estimates, we confirm the presence of an
anti-correlation between $T_s$ and [Z/H], at $3.5\sigma$ significance via a
non-parametric Kendall-tau test. This result was obtained with the assumption
that the DLA covering factor is equal to the core fraction. Monte Carlo
simulations show that the significance of the result is only marginally
decreased if the covering factor and the core fraction are uncorrelated, or if
there is a random error in the inferred covering factor.
  We also find evidence for redshift evolution in DLA $T_s$ values even for the
z>1 sub-sample. Since z>1 DLAs have angular diameter distances comparable to or
larger than those of the background quasars, they have similar efficiency in
covering the quasars. Low covering factors in high-z DLAs thus cannot account
for the observed redshift evolution in spin temperatures. (Abstract abridged.)

sections is derived for the regime in which the momenta are much larger than
the QCD scale. A conceptual complication arise from the fact that there is a
tower of baryons, such as the $\Delta$, with mass splittings from the nucleon
which go to zero at large $N_c$. Since these baryons are stable at large $N_c$,
the meaning of elasticity must be modified. Processes which only transform
nucleons to these baryons are considered elastic; processes in which at least
one additional meson is produced are considered inelastic. It is shown that in
the extreme large $N_c$ limit, the total inelastic cross section is exactly one
eighth of the total cross section. In contrast, in the physical world of
$N_c=3$ the total cross section for high-energy nucleon-nucleon scattering is
dominated by inelastic processes.

in a non-perturbative manner the time-dependence of local observables of
interacting quantum impurity models at all time scales following a quantum
quench. We present a generalization of this method to arbitrary finite
temperature by making use of the full density matrix [Weichselbaum et al. Phys.
Rev. Lett. {\bf 99}, 076402 (2007)]. We show that all terms in the projected
density matrix $\rho^{i\to f} = \rho^{++} + \rho^{--} + \rho^{+-}+\rho^{-+}$ in
the time-evolution of a local observable may be evaluated in closed form, with
$\rho^{+-}=\rho^{-+}=0$. The expression for $\rho^{--}$ is shown to be finite
at finite temperature, becoming negligible only in the limit of vanishing
temperatures. We prove that this approach recovers the short-time limit for the
expectation value of a local observable exactly at arbitrary temperatures. In
contrast, the corresponding long-time limit is only recovered exactly in the
limit $\Lambda\rightarrow 1^{+}$. This limit is impractical within NRG. We
suggest how to overcome this problem by noting that the long-time limit becomes
increasingly more accurate on reducing the size of the quantum quench. This
suggests an improved generalized td-NRG approach in which the system is
time-evolved between the initial and final states via a sequence of small
quantum quenches within a finite time interval instead of a single large
quantum quench. The formalism for this is provided, generalizing the td-NRG to
multiple quantum quenches, periodic switching, and general pulses. This
formalism, like our finite temperature generalization of the single-quench
case, rests only on the NRG approximation. The results are illustrated by
application to the Anderson impurity model.

isogenic cell populations, discrete stochastic models can describe with
sufficient accuracy the evolution of small size populations. However, for a
systematic and efficient study of their long-time behaviour over a wide range
of parameter values, the performance of solely direct temporal simulations
requires significantly high computational time. In addition, when the dynamics
of the cell populations exhibit non-trivial bistable behaviour, such an
analysis becomes a prohibitive task, since a large ensemble of initial states
need to be tested for the quest of possibly co-existing steady state solutions.
In this work, we study cell populations which carry the {\it lac} operon
network exhibiting solution multiplicity over a wide range of extracellular
conditions (inducer concentration). By adopting ideas from the so-called
``equation-free'' methodology, we perform systems-level analysis, which
includes numerical tasks such as the computation of {\it coarse} steady state
solutions, {\it coarse} bifurcation analysis, as well as {\it coarse} stability
analysis. Dynamically stable and unstable macroscopic (population level) steady
state solutions are computed by means of bifurcation analysis utilising short
bursts of fine-scale simulations, and the range of bistability is determined
for different sizes of cell populations. The results are compared with the
deterministic cell population balance (CPB) model, which is valid for large
populations, and we demonstrate the increased effect of stochasticity in small
size populations with asymmetric partitioning mechanisms.

Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia), but the underlying physics and timing of the
detonation are still debated. If an explosion occurs after the secondary star
is fully disrupted, the exploding primary will expand into a dense CO medium
that may still have a disk-like structure. This interaction will decelerate and
distort the ejecta. Here we carry out multi-dimensional simulations of
``tamped"" SN Ia models, using both particle and grid-based codes to study the
merger and explosion dynamics, and a radiative transfer code to calculate
synthetic spectra and light curves. We find that post-merger explosions exhibit
an hourglass-shaped asymmetry, leading to strong variations in the light curves
with viewing angle. The two most important factors affecting the outcome are
the scale-height of the disk, which depends sensitively on the binary mass
ratio, and the total ${}^{56}$Ni yield, which is governed by the central
density of the remnant core. The synthetic broadband light curves rise and
decline very slowly, and the spectra generally look peculiar, with weak
features from intermediate mass elements but relatively strong carbon
absorption. We also consider the effects of the viscous evolution of the
remnant, and show that a longer time delay between merger and explosion
probably leads to larger ${}^{56}$Ni yields and more symmetrical remnants. We
discuss the relevance of this class of aspherical ``tamped"" SN Ia for
explaining the class of ``super-Chandrasekhar'' SN Ia.

binaries on an observed sample by excluding systems detected as binaries
through radial velocity campaigns can be counterproductive. Systems with
significant radial velocity variations are mostly pre-interaction systems.
Excluding them substantially enhances the relative incidence of mergers and
binary products in the non radial velocity variable sample.
  This poses a challenge for testing single stellar evolutionary models. It
also raises the question of whether certain peculiar classes of stars, such as

underlying loop quantum gravity and loop quantum cosmology, especially the
representation theory, relating the appearance of the (dynamically induced)
superselection structure ($\theta$-sectors) in loop quantum cosmology to
recently proposed representations with non-degenerate background geometries in
loop quantum gravity with Abelian structure group. To this end, we review and
employ the concept of extending a given (observable) algebra with possibly
non-trivial centre to a (charged) field algebra with (global) gauge group.We
also interpret the results in terms of the geometry of the structure group G.
Furthermore, we analyze the Koslowski-Sahlmann representations with
non-degenerate background in the case of a non-Abelian structure group. We find
that these representations can be interpreted from two different, though
related, points view: Either, the standard algebras of loop quantum gravity
need to be extended by a (possibly) central term, or the elementary flux vector
fields need to acquire a shift related to the (classical) background to make
these representations well-defined. Both perspectives are linked by the fact
that the background shift is not an automorphism of the algebras, but rather an
affine transformation. Finally, we show how similar algebraic mechanisms, which
are used to explain the breaking of chiral symmetry and the occurrence of
$\theta$-vacua in quantum field theory, extend to loop quantum gravity. Thus,
opening a path for the discussion of these questions in loop quantum gravity.

supernova progenitor from the core bounce until 1.5 seconds later. We present a
sample of hydrodynamic models parameterized to match the explosion energetics

  We find the spatial model dimensionality to be an important contributing
factor in the explosion process. Compared to two-dimensional simulations, our
three-dimensional models require lower neutrino luminosities to produce equally
energetic explosions. We estimate that the convective engine in our models is
4% more efficient in three dimensions than in two dimensions. We propose that
the greater efficiency of the convective engine found in three-dimensional
simulations might be due to the larger surface-to-volume ratio of convective
plumes, which aids in distributing energy deposited by neutrinos.
  We do not find evidence of the standing accretion shock instability nor
turbulence being a key factor in powering the explosion in our models. Instead,
the analysis of the energy transport in the post-shock region reveals
characteristics of penetrative convection. The explosion energy decreases
dramatically once the resolution is inadequate to capture the morphology of
convection on large scales. This shows that the role of dimensionality is
secondary to correctly accounting for the basic physics of the explosion.
  We also analyze information provided by particle tracers embedded in the
flow, and find that the unbound material has relatively long residency times in
two-dimensional models, while in three dimensions a significant fraction of the
explosion energy is carried by particles with relatively short residency times.

because any realistic measurement necessarily has some nonvanishing amount of
noise and therefore never achieves the ideal of sharpness. Assuming a
generalized notion of noncontextuality that applies to arbitrary experimental
procedures, it is shown that the outcome of a measurement depends
deterministically on the ontic state of the system being measured if and only

viscous stress and the rate of change of the magnetic-field strength are
proportional to the local pressure anisotropy, so subject to constraints
imposed by the pressure-anisotropy-driven mirror and firehose instabilities and
controlled by the local instantaneous plasma beta. The dynamics of such plasmas
is dramatically different from a conventional MHD fluid. The plasma is expected
to stay locally in a marginal state with respect to the instabilities, but how
it does this is an open question. Two models of magnetic-field evolution are
investigated. In the first, marginality is achieved via suppression of the rate
of change of the field. In the second, the instabilities give rise to anomalous
collisionality, reducing pressure anisotropy to marginal - at the same time
decreasing viscosity and so increasing the turbulent rate of strain.
Implications of these models are studied in a simplified 0D setting. In the
first model, the field grows explosively but on a time scale that scales with
initial beta, while in the second, dynamical field strength can be reached in
one large-scale turbulence turn-over time regardless of the initial seed. Both
models produce very intermittent fields. Both also suffer from strong
constraints on their applicability: for typical cluster-core conditions, scale
separation between the fluid motions and the microscale fluctuations breaks
down at beta~10^5-10^4. At larger beta (weaker fields), a fully collisionless
plasma dynamo theory is needed in order to justify the growth of the field from
a tiny primordial seed. However, the models discussed here are appropriate for
studying the structure of the currently observed field as well as large-scale
dynamics and thermodynamics of the magnetized ICM or similarly dilute

be triggered stochastically, in which the trans flagellum transitions to a
second mode of beating with attenuated beat-envelope and increased frequency.
Further, exploiting this alga's ability for flagellar regeneration, we
mechanically induced removal of one or the other flagellum of the same cell to

measured cross section in p+p collisions in order to quantify any modifications
of the yield in cold nuclear matter using d+Au data and in hot nuclear matter
using Au+Au data separated into three centrality classes. Our p+p measurement
is based on three times the statistics of our previous result. We obtain a
nuclear modification factor for Upsilon(1S+2S+3S) in the rapidity range |y|<1
in d+Au collisions of R_dAu = 0.79 +/- 0.24 (stat.) +/- 0.03 (sys.) +/- 0.10
(pp sys.). A comparison with models including shadowing and initial state
parton energy loss indicates the presence of additional cold-nuclear matter
suppression. Similarly, in the top 10% most-central Au+Au collisions, we
measure a nuclear modification factor of R_AA=0.49 +/- 0.1 (stat.) +/- 0.02
(sys.) +/- 0.06 (pp sys.), which is a larger suppression factor than that seen
in cold nuclear matter. Our results are consistent with complete suppression of
excited-state Upsilon mesons in Au+Au collisions. The additional suppression in
Au+Au is consistent with the level expected in model calculations that include
the presence of a hot, deconfined Quark-Gluon Plasma. However, understanding
the suppression seen in d+Au is still needed before any definitive statements
about the nature of the suppression in Au+Au can be made.

quantities of data. Automatic tools are necessary to efficiently handle this
material. The measurement of equivalent widths in stellar spectra is
traditionally done by hand or with semi-automatic procedures that are
time-consuming and not very robust with respect to the repeatability of the
results. The program DAOSPEC is a tool that provides consistent measurements of
equivalent widths in stellar spectra while requiring a minimum of user
intervention. However, it is not optimised to deal with large batches of
spectra, as some parameters still need to be modified and checked by the user.
Exploiting the versatility and portability of BASH, we have built a pipeline
called DAOSPEC Option Optimiser (DOOp) automating the procedure of equivalent
widths measurement with DAOSPEC. DOOp is organised in different modules that
run one after the other to perform specific tasks, taking care of the
optimisation of the parameters needed to provide the final equivalent widths,
and providing log files to ensure better control over the procedure. In this
paper, making use of synthetic and observed spectra, we compare the performance
of DOOp with other methods, including DAOSPEC used manually. The measurements
made by DOOp are identical to the ones produced by DAOSPEC when used manually,
while requiring less user intervention, which is convenient when dealing with a
large quantity of spectra. DOOp shows its best performance on high-resolution
spectra (R>20 000) and high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N>30), with uncertainties
ranging from 6 m{\AA} to 2 m{\AA}. The only subjective parameter that remains
is the normalisation, as the user still has to make a choice on the order of
the polynomial used for the continuum fitting. As a test, we use the equivalent
widths measured by DOOp to re-derive the stellar parameters of four
well-studied stars.

main sub-cluster (named C), and a sub-cluster identified in spectroscopic
optical data to have a line-of-sight velocity of +3200 km/s (named B). We
determine the surface brightness in two separate ways: via fits of parametric

consistent surface brightnesses from both analysis methods. We constrain
spectral templates consisting of relativistically corrected thermal and kinetic
SZ signals, using a jointly-derived electron temperature from Chandra and
XMM-Newton under the assumption that each sub-cluster is isothermal. The data
show no evidence for a kinetic SZ signal toward sub-cluster C, but they do
indicate a significant kinetic SZ signal toward sub-cluster B. The

Unfortunately, like any wireless technology, disruption through radio jamming
is possible. This paper investigates the extent to which LTE is vulnerable to
intentional jamming, by analyzing the components of the LTE downlink and uplink
signals. The LTE physical layer consists of several physical channels and
signals, most of which are vital to the operation of the link. By taking into
account the density of these physical channels and signals with respect to the
entire frame, as well as the modulation and coding schemes involved, we come up
with a series of vulnerability metrics in the form of jammer to signal ratios.
The ``weakest links'' of the LTE signals are then identified, and used to
establish the overall vulnerability of LTE to hostile interference.

transition of the Universe at nonzero chemical potential is revisited within
the microscopic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock approach employed for the hadron phase,
using two kinds of baryon interactions as fundamental inputs. To describe the
deconfined phase of quark matter, we use a recently developed quark mass
density-dependent model with a fully self-consistent thermodynamic treatment of
confinement. We study the baryon number limit $A_{\rm boil}$ (above which
boiling may be important) with three typical values for the confinement
parameter $D$. It is firstly found that the baryon interaction with a softer
equation of state for the hadron phase would only lead to a small increase of
$A_{\rm boil}$. However, results depend sensitively on the confinement
parameter in the quark model. Specifically, boiling might be important during
the Universe cooling for a limited parameter range around $D^{1/2} = 170$ MeV,
a value satisfying recent lattice QCD calculations of the vacuum chiral
condensate, while for other choices of this parameter, boiling might not happen
and cosmological quark nuggets of $10^2 < A < 10^{50}$ could survive.

adequately estimate aerodynamic forces. But to this day, obtaining the drag
acting on the complicated shapes of modern spacecraft suffers from many sources
of error. While part of the problem is the uncertain density in the upper
atmosphere, this works focuses on improving the modeling of interacting
rarified gases and satellite surfaces. The only numerical approach that
currently captures effects in this flow regime---like self-shadowing and
multiple molecular reflections---is known as test-particle Monte Carlo. This
method executes a ray-tracing algorithm to follow particles that pass through a
control volume containing the spacecraft and accumulates the momentum transfer
to the body surfaces. Statistical fluctuations inherent in the approach demand
particle numbers in the order of millions, often making this scheme too costly
to be practical. This work presents a parallel test-particle Monte Carlo method
that takes advantage of both GPUs and multi-core CPUs. The speed at which this
model can run with millions of particles allowed exploring a regime where a
flaw in the model's initial particle seeding was revealed. Our new model
introduces an analytical fix based on seeding the calculation with an initial
distribution of particles at the boundary of a spherical control volume and
computing the integral for the correct number flux. This work includes
verification of the proposed model using analytical solutions for several
simple geometries and demonstrates uses for studying aero-stabilization of the
Phobos-Grunt Martian probe and pose-estimation for the ICESat mission.

great promise for the next generation of non-volatile memory devices. However,
the ultra fast phase transformations required for these applications can be
exceedingly complex even for single component systems, and a full physical
understanding of these phenomena is still lacking. In this paper we study
nucleation and growth of crystalline Ge from amorphous thin films at high
temperature using phase field models informed by atomistic calculations of
fundamental material properties. The atomistic calculations capture the full
anisotropy of the Ge crystal lattice, which results in orientation dependences
for interfacial energies and mobilities. These orientation relations are then
exactly recovered by the phase field model at finite thickness via a novel
parametrization strategy based on invariance solutions of the Allen-Cahn
equations. By means of this multiscale approach, we study the interplay between
nucleation and growth and find that the relation between the mean radius of the
crystallized Ge grains and the nucleation rate follows simple Avrami-type
scaling laws. We argue that these can be used to cover a wide region of the
nucleation rate space, hence facilitating comparison with experiments.

a potential eavesdropper. Both two-phase and three-phase two-way relay
strategies are considered. Our goal is to jointly optimize the source and relay
beamformers for maximizing the secrecy sum rate of the two-way communications.
We first derive the optimal relay beamformer structures. Then, iterative
algorithms are proposed to find source and relay beamformers jointly based on
alternating optimization. Furthermore, we conduct asymptotic analysis on the
maximum secrecy sum-rate. Our analysis shows that when all transmit powers
approach infinity, the two-phase two-way relay scheme achieves the maximum
secrecy sum rate if the source beamformers are designed such that the received
signals at the relay align in the same direction. This reveals an important
advantage of signal alignment technique in against eavesdropping. It is also
shown that if the source powers approach zero the three-phase scheme performs
the best while the two-phase scheme is even worse than direct transmission.
Simulation results have verified the efficiency of the secure beamforming
algorithms as well as the analytical findings.

to treat the quantum dynamics of a single-universe state. We also find an

redshift work against. It is not clear, however, how representative the Coma
cluster is for galaxy clusters of its mass or X-ray luminosity, and
significantly: recent works have suggested that the galaxy population of Coma
may be in some ways anomolous. In this work, we present a comparison of Coma to
an X-ray selected control sample of clusters. We show that although Coma is
typical against the control sample in terms of its internal kinematics
(substructure and velocity dispersion profile), it has a significantly high
(~3sigma) X-ray temperature set against clusters of comparable mass. By
de-redshifting our control sample cluster galaxies star-formation rates using a
fit to the galaxy main sequence evolution at z < 0.1, we determine that the
typical star-formation rate of Coma galaxies as a function of mass is higher
than for galaxies in our control sample at a confidence level of > 99 per cent.
One way to alleviate this discrepency and bring Coma in-line with the control
sample would be to have the distance to Coma to be slightly lower, perhaps
through a non-negligible peculiar velocity with respect to the Hubble
expansion, but we do not regard this as likely given precision measurements
using a variety of approaches. Therefore in summary, we urge caution in using
Coma as a z~0 baseline cluster in galaxy evolution studies.

If correct, this would open a new window on the distribution of intergalactic
baryons. These schemes are based on the statistical properties of the received
radiation, such as the 2- or 4-point correlation function of the received
electric field, and in one case on the quantum nature of the electromagnetic
field. We show, on the basis of general principles, that these schemes are not
sensitive to dispersion measure (or have an extremely small signal-to-noise
ratio), because (i) the classical 2-point correlation function is unaffected by
dispersion; (ii) for a source with a large number of incoherently emitting
electrons, the central limit theorem obliterates additional information in
higher-order functions; and (iii) such an emitter produces a radiation density
matrix that is equivalent to a statistical distribution of coherent states,
which contains no information that is not already in the statistics of the
classical waveforms. Why the proposed observables do not depend on dispersion
measure (or have extremely tiny dependences) is discussed in detail.

associated random walks: the complex obtuse random variables. They are the
generalization to the complex case of the real-valued obtuse random variables
which were introduced in \cite{A-E} in order to understand the structure of
normal martingales in $\RR^n$.The extension to the complex case is mainly
motivated by considerations from Quantum Statistical Mechanics, in particular
for the seek of a characterization of those quantum baths acting as classical
noises. The extension of obtuse random variables to the complex case is far
from obvious and hides very interesting algebraical structures. We show that
complex obtuse random variables are characterized by a 3-tensor which admits
certain symmetries which we show to be the exact 3-tensor analogue of the
normal character for 2-tensors (i.e. matrices), that is, a necessary and
sufficient condition for being diagonalizable in some orthonormal basis. We
discuss the passage to the continuous-time limit for these random walks and
show that they converge in distribution to normal martingales in $\CC^N$. We
show that the 3-tensor associated to these normal martingales encodes their
behavior, in particular the diagonalization directions of the 3-tensor indicate
the directions of the space where the martingale behaves like a diffusion and
those where it behaves like a Poisson process. We finally prove the
convergence, in the continuous-time limit, of the corresponding multiplication
operators on the canonical Fock space, with an explicit expression in terms of
the associated 3-tensor again.

from the regularized ground-state energy ${}^\epsilon\!E(v)$ in a simple way.
All concepts and results pertaining to the original $(E,F)$ pair have direct

interpretation of unexpected results of the JLab polarization experiments to
measure the Sachs form factors ratio $G_E/G_M$ in the region $1. 0 \leq Q^2

is a generalization of the constituent-counting rules of the perturbative QCD

the considered region the hard-scattering mechanism of pQCD is realized. Within
the framework of the developed approach we calculated the hard kernel of the
proton current matrix elements $J^{\pm \delta, \delta }_{p}$ for the full set
of spin combinations corresponding to the number of the spin-flipped quarks,
which contribute to the proton transition without spin-flip ($J^{\delta, \delta

state that (i) around the lower boundary of the considered region, the leading
scaling behavior of the Sachs form factors has the form $G_E, G_M \sim 1/Q^6$,
(ii) the dipole dependence ($G_E, G_M \sim 1/Q^4$) is realized in the
asymptotic regime of pQCD when $\tau \gg 1$ ($\tau=Q^2/4M^2$) in the case when
the quark transitions with spin-flip dominate, (iii) the asymptotic regime of
pQCD in the JLab experiments has not yet been achieved, and (iv) the linear
decrease of the ratio $G_{E}/G_{M}$ at $\tau < 1$ is due to additional
contributions to $J^{\delta, \delta }_{p}$ by spin-flip transitions of two
quarks and an additional contribution to $J^{-\delta, \delta }_{p}$ by
spin-flip transitions of three quarks.

detection of specific molecules in the atmosphere of the exoplanet. We
performed simulations of high-resolution CRIRES observations of a planet's
thermal emission and transit between 1-5 micron and performed a
cross-correlation analysis on these results to assess how well the planet
signal can be extracted. We also simulated day-side and night-side spectra at
high spectral resolution for planets with and without a day-side temperature
inversion, based on the cases of HD 189733b and HD 209458b. Several small
wavelength regions in the L-band promise to yield cross-correlation signals
from the thermal emission of hot Jupiters that can exceed those of the current
detections by up to a factor of 2-3 for the same integration time. For transit
observations, the H-band is also attractive, with the H, K, and L-band giving
cross-correlation signals of similar strength. High-resolution night-side
spectra of hot Jupiters can give cross-correlation signals as high as the
day-side, or even higher. We show that there are many new possibilities for
high-resolution observations of exoplanet atmospheres that have expected planet
signals at least as high as those already detected. Hence, high-resolution
observations at well-chosen wavelengths and at different phases can improve our

and mode 3 particles. Evaporation of these particles below the clouds creates a
local sulfuric acid vapor maximum that causes upwelling of sulfuric acid back
into the clouds. If the polysulfur condensation nuclei are small and their
production rate is high, coagulation of small droplets onto larger droplets in
the middle cloud may result in sulfuric acid ""rain"" below the clouds once every
few Earth months. Reduction of the polysulfur condensation nuclei production
rate destroys this oscillation and reduces the mode 1 particle abundance in the
middle cloud by two orders of magnitude, though it better reproduces the
sulfur-to-sulfuric-acid mass ratio in the cloud and haze droplets. In general
we find satisfactory agreement between our results and observations, though
improvements could be made by incorporating sulfur microphysics.

stellar luminosity functions at high redshift z>1.5, to probe different stages
in the coevolution of supermassive black holes (BHs) and host galaxies. The
results of our analysis indicate the following scenario: (i) the star formation
in the host galaxy proceeds within a heavily dust-enshrouded medium at an
almost constant rate over a timescale ~0.5-1 Gyr, and then abruptly declines
due to quasar feedback; over the same timescale, (ii) part of the interstellar
medium loses angular momentum, reaches the circum-nuclear regions at a rate
proportional to the star formation and is temporarily stored into a massive
reservoir/proto-torus wherefrom it can be promptly accreted; (iii) the BH grows
by accretion in a self-regulated regime with radiative power that can slightly
exceed the Eddington limit L/L_Edd< 4, particularly at the highest redshifts;
(iv) for massive BHs the ensuing energy feedback at its maximum exceeds the
stellar one and removes the interstellar gas, thus stopping the star formation
and the fueling of the reservoir; (v) afterwards, if the latter has retained
enough gas, a phase of supply-limited accretion follows exponentially declining
with a timescale of about 2 e-folding times. We show that the ratio of the FIR
luminosity of the host galaxy to the bolometric luminosity of the AGN maps the
various stages of the above sequence. Finally, we discuss how the detailed
properties and the specific evolution of the reservoir can be investigated via
coordinated, high-resolution observations of starforming, strongly-lensed
galaxies in the (sub-)mm band with ALMA and in the X-ray band with Chandra and
the next generation X-ray instruments.

molecular data, catalogue sources, and a nearby Fermi gamma-ray detection of
unidentified origin, are combined to explore possible counterparts to the very
high energy source. We provide with a deep radio image of a supernova remnant
that might be related to the GeV and TeV emission in the region. We confirm the
presence of an H II region next to the supernova remnant and coincident with
molecular emission. A potential region of star formation is also identified. We
identify several radio and X-ray sources in the surroundings. Some of these
sources are known planetary nebulae, whereas others may be non-thermal extended
emitters and embedded young stellar objects. Three old, background Galactic
pulsars also neighbour HESS J1858+020 along the line of sight. The region
surrounding HESS J1858+020 is rich in molecular structures and non-thermal
objects that may potentially be linked to this unidentified very high energy

clouds may be a good candidate, but a star forming region, or a non-thermal
radio source of yet unclear nature, may also be behind the gamma-ray source.

use of these junction conditions, we then derive the Minkowski and de Sitter
brane solutions embedded into the $Z_2$-symmetric five-dimensional anti-de
Sitter (AdS) bulk spacetime. The configuration of the scalar field depends on
the slice of the AdS spacetime. These branes are supported by the tension and
not coupled to the scalar field. The Minkowski brane solution can be obtained
when the brane tension is tuned to the bulk contributions. Once this tuning
relation is broken, the de Sitter brane solutions are obtained. The de Sitter
brane solutions have two branches. One has the smooth limit to the case where
the scalar field becomes trivial, while the other branch does not. The latter
branch has the upper bound on the brane tension, where the expansion rate
vanishes. Finally, we investigate the low energy effective gravitational theory
realized on the brane, which is given by the four-dimensional Einstein-scalar
theory with the corrections from the bulk. In the case that there is no
generation of the dark radiation from the bulk scalar field, we recover the the

neutron stars have sometimes significant angulal velocities that can in
principle stall the spherical accretion and potentially change the conclusions
derived about the time it takes for black holes to destroy a star. We study the
effect of the star rotation on the growth of such black holes and the evolution
of the black hole spin. Assuming no mechanisms of angular momentum evacuation,
we find that even moderate rotation rates can in fact destroy spherical
accretion at the early stages of the black hole growth. However, we demonstrate
that the viscosity of nuclear matter can alleviate the effect of rotation,
making it possible for the black hole to maintain spherical accretion while
impeding the black hole from becoming maximally rotating.

delay more conveniently than epidemic routing. Literature provides
comprehensive results on optimal routing policies for mobile nodes with
homogeneous mobility, often neglecting signaling costs. Routing policies are
customarily computed by means of fluid approximation techniques, which assure
solutions to be optimal only when the number of nodes is infinite, while they
provide a coarse approximation otherwise. This work addresses heterogeneous
mobility patterns and multiple wireless transmission technologies; moreover, we
explicitly consider the beaconing/signaling costs to support routing and the
possibility for nodes to discard packets after a local time. We theoretically
characterize the optimal policies by deriving their formal properties. Such
analysis is leveraged to define two algorithmic approaches which allow to trade
off optimality with computational efficiency. Theoretical bounds on the
approximation guarantees of the proposed algorithms are derived. We then

interactions and it is expected to have Ising character at low temperature.
Contrary to expectations, it shows no magnetic ordering down to 0.05\,K, being
thus labelled a ""spin liquid"". However, the ground state in Tb2Ti2O7 is not a
mere fluctuating moment paramagnet but, as demonstrated by very recent
experiments, a state where the electronic degrees of freedom are hybridised
with the phononic variables in an unconventional way. We show here that, by
approximating this complex and still unraveled electron-phonon interaction by a
dynamic Jahn-Teller coupling, one can account rather well for the diffuse
neutron scattering and the low temperature isothermal magnetisation. We discuss
the shortcomings of this picture which arise mainly from the fact that the
singlet electronic mean field ground state of the model fails to reproduce the
observed strong intensity of the elastic and quasi-elastic neutron scattering.

disordered models the critical behavior of which is described by an infinite
randomness fixed point. In the {\it disordered contact process}, the quenched
survival probability $\mathcal{P}(t)$ defined in fixed random environments is
found to show multi-scaling in the critical point, meaning that
$\mathcal{P}(t)=t^{-\delta}$, where the (environment and time-dependent)
exponent $\delta$ has a universal limit distribution when $t\to\infty$. The
limit distribution is determined by the strong disorder renormalization group
method analytically in the end point of a semi-infinite lattice, where it is
found to be exponential, while, in the infinite system, conjectures on its
limiting behaviors for small and large $\delta$, which are based on numerical
results, are formulated. By the same method, the quenched survival probability
in the problem of {\it random walks in random environments} is also shown to
exhibit multi-scaling with an exponential limit distribution. In addition to
this, the (imaginary-time) spin-spin autocorrelation function of the {\it
random transverse-field Ising chain} is found to have a form similar to that of
survival probability of the contact process at the level of the renormalization
approach. Consequently, a relationship between the corresponding limit
distributions in the two problems can be established. Finally, the distribution
of the spontaneous magnetization in this model is also discussed.

in view of analyzing their potential for thermoelectric applications. The
lanthanum motions are strongly coupled to the tellurium motions in the
telluride, whereas the motions of both types of atoms are decoupled in the
sulfides. Nevertheless, this has no impact on their thermal properties because
experimentally all compounds have low thermal conductivity. We believe that
this is due to Umklapp scattering of the acoustical modes, notably by the low
energy optical modes at about 7-8 meV found in all three chalcogenides, as in
cage compounds such as skutterudites or clathrates, even though there are no
cages in the cubic Th3P4 structure. We find that the energy bandgap increases
from the telluride to the sulfide in good agreement with the experiments.
However, due to their similar band structure, we find that all three compounds
have almost identical thermoelectric properties. Our results agree
qualitatively with the experiments, especially in the case of the telluride for
which a great amount of data exists. All our results indicate that the sulfides
have strong potential for thermoelectricity and could replace the tellurides if
the charge carrier concentration is optimized. Finally, we predict also a
larger maximum ZT for the p-type doped materials than for the n-type doped
ones, even though compounds with p-doping have still to be synthesized. Thus
our results indicate the possibility to make high temperature performing
thermo-generators based only on La3X4 compounds.

allometric scaling is based on exponential growth of city size and can be

fractals. However, both city population and urban area comply with the course
of logistic growth rather than exponential growth. In this paper, I will
present a new allometric scaling based on logistic growth to solve the
abovementioned problem. The logistic growth is a process of replacement
dynamics. Defining a pair of replacement quotients as new measurements, which
are functions of urban area and population, we can derive an allometric scaling
relation from the logistic processes of urban growth, which can be termed
""logistic allometry"". The exponential allometric relation between urban area
and population is the approximate expression of the logistic allometric
equation when the city size is not large enough. The proper range of the
allometric scaling exponent value is reconsidered through the logistic process.
Then, a medium-sized city of Henan Province, China, is employed as an example
to validate the new allometric relation. The logistic allometry is helpful for
further understanding the fractal property and self-organized process of urban

to uniformly control how much the empirical average deviates from the expected
cost function. Standard arguments imply that the performance of the empirical
predictor also exhibit such guarantees. The level of genericity of the approach
encompasses several possible constraints on the factors (tensor product
structure, shift-invariance, sparsity \ldots), thus providing a unified
perspective on the sample complexity of several widely used matrix
factorization schemes. The derived generalization bounds behave proportional to
$\sqrt{\log(n)/n}$ w.r.t.\ the number of samples $n$ for the considered matrix
factorization techniques.

shape anisotropy are being pursued. In this work we assess the limits of shape
contributions to the reversal stability using micromagnetic simulations. In a
first series of tests we altered the aspect ratio of single phase prolate
spheroids from 1 to 16. Starting with a sphere of radius $4.3$ times the
exchange length $ L_{\mathrm{ex}}$ we kept the total magnetic volume constant
as the aspect ratio was modified. For a ferromagnet with zero
magnetocrystalline anisotropy the maximum coercive field reached up to $0.5$
times the magnetization $M_{\mathrm{s}}$. Therefore, in materials with moderate
uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy, the addition of shape anisotropy could
even double the coercive field. Interestingly due to non-uniform magnetization
reversal there is no significant increase of the coercive field for an aspect
ratio greater than 5. A similar limit of the maximum aspect ratio was observed
in cylinders. The coercive field depends on the wire diameter. By decreasing
the wire diameter from $8.7 L_{\mathrm{ex}}$ to $2.2 L_{\mathrm{ex}}$ the
coercive field increased by 40%. In the cylinders nucleation of a reversed
domain starts at the corners at the end. Smoothing the edges can improve the
coercive field by about 10%.
  In further simulations we compacted soft magnetic cylinders into a bulk-like
arrangement. Misalignment and magnetostatic interactions cause a spread of $0.1
M_{\mathrm{s}}$ in the switching fields of the rods. Comparing the volume
averaged hysteresis loops computed for isolated rods and the hysteresis loop
computed for interacting rods, we conclude that magnetostatic interactions
reduce the coercive field by up to 20%.

of the events (54%) are found to happen in active regions, and 50% of these

localized in the quiet Sun. We performed a comprehensive analysis of the
possible instrumental artifacts and we conclude that the observed signal is of

characteristics of the active region events. The long periods and the
amplitudes observed rule out any explanation in terms of magnetohydrodynamic
waves. Thermal nonequilibrium could produce the right periods, but it fails to
explain all the observed properties of coronal loops and the spatial coherence
of the events. We propose that moderate temporal variations of the heating term
in the energy equation, so as to avoid a thermal nonequilibrium state, could be
sufficient to explain those long-period intensity pulsations. The large number
of detections suggests that these pulsations are common in active regions. This
would imply that the measurement of their properties could provide new
constraints on the heating mechanisms of coronal loops.

have a large impact on the description of chemical and physical properties in
the systems of interest. In this context, the development of efficient
approaches for the accurate calculation of the long-range correlation energy
(and hence dispersion) is the main challenge. In the last years a number of
methods have been developed to augment density functional approximations via
dispersion energy corrections, but most of these approaches ignore the
intrinsic many-body nature of correlation effects, leading to inconsistent and
sometimes even qualitatively incorrect predictions. Here we build upon the
recent many-body dispersion (MBD) framework, which is intimately linked to the
random-phase approximation for the correlation energy. We separate the
correlation energy into short-range contributions that are modeled by
semi-local functionals and long-range contributions that are calculated by
mapping the complex all-electron problem onto a set of atomic response
functions coupled in the dipole approximation. We propose an effective
range-separation of the coupling between the atomic response functions that
extends the already broad applicability of the MBD method to non-metallic
materials with highly anisotropic responses, such as layered nanostructures.
Application to a variety of high-quality benchmark datasets illustrates the
accuracy and applicability of the improved MBD approach, which offers the
prospect of first-principles modeling of large structurally complex systems
with an accurate description of the long-range correlation energy.

Information Maps can be local or global, with static and dynamic information in

store arbitrary attributes of a sensor's preprocessing in an Information Map

procedure is much more efficient than using the attributes of the sensor
itself. Some examples where and how Information Maps can be used are presented

quiescent and flaring states. Since this active star is near the
fully-convective boundary, to study in detail its long-term chromospheric
activity could be an appreciable contribution for the dynamo theory. Here, we
analyze with the Lomb-Scargle periodogram the Ca II K line-core fluxes derived
from CASLEO spectra obtained between 2001 and 2013 and the V magnitude from the
ASAS database between 2004 and 2010. From both totally independent time-series,
we obtain a possible activity cycle of period $\sim7$ years and a
less-significant shorter one of $\sim2$ years. A tentative interpretation is
that a dynamo operating near the surface could be generating the longer cycle,
while a second dynamo operating in the deep convection zone could be
responsible for the shorter one. Based on the long duration of our observing
program at CASLEO and the fact that we observe simultaneously different
spectral features, we also analyze the relation between simultaneous
measurements of the Na I index ($R^{\prime}_D$), H$\alpha$ and Ca II K fluxes
at different activity levels of AD Leo, including flares.

reward distributed problems gathered with the usual baseline approach. The
exploration parameters are still updated by a baseline approach - leaving the
exploration prone to asymmetric reward distributions. In this paper we will
show how the exploration parameters can be sampled quasi symmetric despite
having limited instead of free parameters for exploration. We give a
transformation approximation to get quasi symmetric samples with respect to the
exploration without changing the overall sampling distribution. Finally we will
demonstrate that sampling symmetrically also for the exploration parameters is
superior in needs of samples and robustness than the original sampling

It has applications
in many areas of science and has been explored on random networks for several
decades. In single layer (simplex) networks, it has been recently observed that
bootstrap percolation, which is defined as an incremental process, can be seen
as the opposite of pruning percolation, where nodes are removed according to a
connectivity rule. Here we propose models of both bootstrap and pruning
percolation for multiplex networks. We collectively refer to these two models
with the concept of ""weak"" percolation, to distinguish them from the somewhat
classical concept of ordinary (""strong"") percolation. While the two models
coincide in simplex networks, we show that they decouple when considering
multiplexes, giving rise to a wealth of critical phenomena. Our bootstrap model
constitutes the simplest example of a contagion process on a multiplex network
and has potential applications in critical infrastructure recovery and
information security. Moreover, we show that our pruning percolation model may
provide a way to diagnose missing layers in a multiplex network. Finally, our
analytical approach allows us to calculate critical behavior and characterize
critical clusters.

if gas flows inward at much higher radial speeds inside the cavity than outside
the cavity, since surface density (and by extension optical depth) varies
inversely with inflow velocity at fixed accretion rate. Radial speeds within
the cavity might even have to approach free-fall values to explain the huge
surface density contrasts inferred for transition disks. We identify
observational diagnostics of fast radial inflow in channel maps made in
optically thick spectral lines. Signatures include (1) twisted isophotes in
maps made at low systemic velocities and (2) rotation of structures observed
between maps made in high-velocity line wings. As a test case, we apply our new
diagnostic tools to archival ALMA data on the transition disk HD 142527, and
uncover evidence for free-fall radial velocities inside its cavity. Although
the observed kinematics are also consistent with a disk warp, the radial inflow
scenario is preferred because it predicts low surface densities that appear
consistent with recent observations of optically thin CO isotopologues in this
disk. How material in the disk cavity sheds its angular momentum wholesale to
fall freely onto the star is an unsolved problem; gravitational torques exerted

transport between electrons and acoustic phonons at temperatures above the
Bloch-Grueneisen temperature. Consequently, energy transport can be dominated
by supercollision events, involving also other scattering processes. Scattering
from flexural phonons can compensate for the large momentum transfer involved
in scattering from thermal acoustic phonons, and enables similar supercollision
events as disorder. Such multiphonon processes are also allowed by selection
rules. I show that acoustic-flexural process can in the energy transport be of
the same order of magnitude as direct flexural and acoustic phonon processes,
depending on electronic screening and mechanical strain.

are antiderivatives of two real functions $f$ and $g$ resp., then an
antiderivative of $\lambda f+g$ is $\lambda F + G$. It may be surprising that
such systematic an integration formula exists for the inverse of a function
$f$, a fact that seems to have been discovered for the first time by Laisant in
1905, and seems not to be well known. More precisely, if $f$ is an invertible
real function, and if $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$, then the antiderivative
of $f^{-1}$ is $xf^{-1}(x)-F\circ f^{-1}(x)+C$. Laisant, and other authors
after him, assumes that $f^{-1}$ is differentiable, in which case the proof of
this formula is immediate. Recently, it has been shown by Key that this
additional assumption is unnecessary. In this paper, we give two different

challenge is to build a realistic interaction that can be used over a wide
range of masses and in infinite matter starting from the available experimental
data on the binding energy of light hypernuclei. To this end, accurate
calculations of the hyperon binding energy in a hypernucleus are necessary. We
present a quantum Monte Carlo study of $\Lambda$ and $\Lambda\Lambda$
hypernuclei up to $A=91$. We investigate the contribution of two- and
three-body $\Lambda$-nucleon forces to the $\Lambda$ binding energy. Ground
state energies are computed solving the Schr\""odinger equation for
non-relativistic baryons by means of the auxiliary field diffusion Monte Carlo
algorithm extended to the hypernuclear sector. We show that a simple adjustment
of the parameters of the $\Lambda NN$ three-body force yields a very good
agreement with available experimental data over a wide range of hypernuclear
masses. In some cases no experiments have been performed yet, and we give new
predictions. The newly fitted $\Lambda NN$ force properly describes the physics
of medium-heavy $\Lambda$ hypernuclei, correctly reproducing the saturation
property of the hyperon separation energy.

is the dynamic pressure associated with Saturn's cold, subcorotating plasma.

here. However, their equations of motion for classical spinning particles are
unambiguous.

Kaluza-Klein universe in the state of thermal equilibrium, composed of dark
matter and dark energy. The generalized holographic dark energy and generalized
Ricci dark energy models are considered here. It is proved that the first and
generalized second law of thermodynamics are valid on the apparent horizon for
both of these models. Further, we take a horizon of radius $L$ with modified
holographic or Ricci dark energy. We conclude that these models do not obey the
first and generalized second law of thermodynamics on the horizon of fixed
radius $L$ for a specific range of model parameters.

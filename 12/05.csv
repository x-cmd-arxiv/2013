crystal (LC) phase, disturb its alignment and are subject to elastic forces.
These forces are long-ranged, anisotropic and tunable through temperature or
external fields, making them a valuable asset to control colloidal assembly.
The latter is very sensitive to the particle geometry since it alters the
interactions between the colloids. We here present a detailed numerical
analysis of the energetics of elongated objects, namely prolate ellipsoids,
immersed in a nematic host. The results, complemented with qualitative
experiments, reveal novel LC configurations with peculiar topological
properties around the ellipsoids, depending on their aspect ratio and the
boundary conditions imposed on the nematic order parameter. The latter also
determine the preferred orientation of ellipsoids in the nematic field, because
of elastic torques, as well as the morphology of particles aggregates.

trapping potential is often included in experiments with cold atoms and
modifies the critical finite-size scaling of the homogeneous system in a non

through the exponent $\theta$.
  We perform extensive simulations of the BH model at the critical temperature,
in the presence of harmonic traps. We find that the TSS predictions are
universal once we account for the effective way in which the trap locally
modifies the chemical potential $\mu$ of the system. The trap exponent for the
BH model at $\mu=0$ is the one corresponding to an effective quartic potential.
At positive $\mu$, evidence suggests that TSS breaks down sufficiently far from
the centre of the trap, as the system encounters an effective phase boundary.

the existing sample of lenses found with the Hershcel Space Observatory is
enough to formally rule out the standard models of the evolving population of
dark-matter halos, with the likely explanation a combination of baryon physics
and the perturbation by infalling baryons of the density distribution of dark
matter at the centres of the halos. Independently of the evolution of the
halos, observations of a sample of 100 lensed systems would be enough to
estimate Omega_Lambda with a precision of 5% and observations of 1000 lenses
would be enough to estimate w, the parameter in the equation-of-state of dark
energy, with a precision similar to that obtained from the Planck observations
of the cosmic microwave background. While the fraction of submillimetre sources
that are lensed depends weakly on the specific halo mass function that is used
in the model, it depends very strongly on the evolution of the submillimetre
luminosity function of the source population. Therefore measurements of the
lensing fraction could be used to investigate galaxy evolution in a way that is
independent of the properties of the intervening halos.

customers geographically. The utility purchases electricity for its customers
via bulk transactions on the wholesale market, and it passes these costs along
to its customers, the end consumers, through their rate plan. Typically, all
residential consumers are offered the same per unit rate plan, which leads to
cost sharing. Some consumers use their electricity at peak hours, when it is
more expensive on the wholesale market, and others consume mostly at off peak
hours, when it is cheaper, but they all enjoy the same per unit rate through
their utility. This paper proposed a method for the utility to segment a
population of consumers on the basis of their individual consumption patterns.
An optimal recruitment algorithm was developed to aggregate consumers into
groups with a relatively low per unit cost of electricity on the wholesale
market. It was then proposed that the utility should group together enough
consumers to ensure an adequately low forecast error, which is related to risks
it faces in wholesale market transactions. Finally, it was shown that by
repeated application of this process, the utility could segment the entire
population into groups and offer them differentiated rate plans based on their
actual consumption behavior. These groupings are stable in the sense that no
one consumer can unilaterally improve her outcome.

every quantum gate. However, correcting errors is costly in terms of time and
number of qubits. Here we demonstrate that quantum error correction can be
applied significantly less often with only a minimal loss of fidelity. This is
done by simulating the implementation of 50 encoded, single-qubit, quantum
gates within the [[7,1,3]] quantum error correction code in a noisy,
non-equiprobable Pauli error environment with error correction being applied at
different intervals. We find that applying error correction after every gate is
rarely optimal and even applying error correction only once after all 50 gates,
though not generally optimal, sacrifices only a slight amount of fidelity with
the benefit of 50-fold saving of resources. In addition, we find that in cases
where bit-flip errors are dominant, it is best not to apply error correction at
all.

major challenges of theoretical physics. This problem can be cracked in part by
investigating the macroscopic fluctuations of the currents characterizing
nonequilibrium behavior, their statistics and associated structures. This
fundamental line of research has been severely hampered by the overwhelming
complexity of this problem. However, during the last years two new general
methods have appeared to investigate fluctuating behavior that are changing
radically our understanding of nonequilibrium physics: a powerful macroscopic
fluctuation theory (MFT) and a set of advanced computational techniques to
measure rare events. In this work we study the statistics of current
fluctuations in nonequilibrium diffusive systems, using macroscopic fluctuation
theory as theoretical framework, and advanced Monte Carlo simulations of
several stochastic lattice gases as a laboratory to test the emerging picture.
Our quest will bring us from (1) the confirmation of an additivity conjecture
in one and two dimensions, which considerably simplifies the MFT complex
variational problem to compute the thermodynamics of currents, to (2) the
discovery of novel isometric fluctuation relations, which opens an unexplored
route toward a deeper understanding of nonequilibrium physics by bringing
symmetry principles to the realm of fluctuations, and to (3) the observation of
coherent structures in fluctuations, which appear via dynamic phase transitions
involving a spontaneous symmetry breaking event at the fluctuating level. The
clear-cut observation, measurement and characterization of these unexpected
phenomena, well described by MFT, strongly support this theoretical scheme as
the natural theory to understand the thermodynamics of currents in
nonequilibrium diffusive media, opening new avenues of research in
nonequilibrium physics.

micromechanical beam coupled to a dc-SQUID (superconducting quantum
interference device). The coupling between these systems places the modes of
the beam in a highly nonlinear potential, whose shape can be altered by varying
the control parameters of the SQUID. We detect the position of the beam by
placing it in an optical cavity, which frees the SQUID to be used solely for
actuation. This enables us to probe the previously unexplored full parameter
space of this device. We measure the frequency response of the beam and find
that it displays a periodic dependence on applied magnetic flux. To account for
this, we develop a model based on the standard theory for SQUID dynamics. In
addition, with the aim of understanding if the device can reach nonlinearity at
the single phonon level, we use this model to show that the responsivity of the
current circulating in the SQUID to the position of the beam can become
divergent, with its magnitude limited only by noise. This suggests a direction
for the generation of macroscopically distinguishable superposition states of
the beam.

at a resolution of $\sim$0.75 arcsec, placing an upper-limit of 2.5 kpc to the
half-light radius of the continuum emission from heated-dust. After
deconvolving for the beam size, however, we found a $\sim3\sigma$ indication of
an intrinsic source size of $0.27\pm0.08$ arcsec (Gaussian FWHM), which would
correspond to $r_{half}\sim0.9\pm0.3$ kpc. We build the far-IR SED of XID403 by
combining datapoints from both ALMA and Herschel and fit it with a modified
blackbody spectrum. For the first time, we measure the dust temperature
$T_d=58.5\pm5.3$ K in this system, which is comparable to what has been
observed in other high-z submillimeter galaxies. The measured star formation
rate is SFR=$1020\pm150$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, in agreement with previous
estimates at lower S/N. Based on the measured SFR and source size, we constrain
the SFR surface density to be $\Sigma_{SFR}>26\;M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$
($\sim200\;M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$ for $r_{half}\sim0.9$ kpc). The
compactness of this starburst is comparable to what has been observed in other

dust region, assuming $r_{half}\sim0.9\pm0.3$ kpc, this would produce a column
density of $N_H\sim0.3-1.1\times10^{24}$cm$^{-2}$ towards the central SMBH,
similar to the column density of $\approx1.4\times10^{24}$cm$^{-2}$ measured

of luminous galaxies in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We
find a potentially new observational class of AGN, one with strong and broad
MgII $2799$\AA\ line emission, but very weak emission in other normal
indicators of AGN activity, such as the broad line H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, and the
near-ultraviolet AGN continuum, leading to an extreme ratio of broad
H$\alpha$/MgII flux relative to normal quasars. Meanwhile, these objects'
narrow-line flux ratios reveal AGN narrow-line regions with levels of activity
consistent with the MgII fluxes and in agreement with that of normal quasars.
These AGN may represent an extreme case of the Baldwin effect, with very low
continuum and high equivalent width relative to typical quasars, but their
ratio of broad MgII to broad Balmer emission remains very unusual. They may
also be representative of a class of AGN where the central engine is observed
indirectly with scattered light. These galaxies represent a small fraction of
the total population of luminous galaxies ($\simeq 0.1$\%), but are more likely
(about 3.5 times) to have AGN-like nuclear line emission properties than other
luminous galaxiess. Because MgII is usually inaccessible for the population of
nearby galaxies, there may exist a related population of broad-line MgII
emitters in the local universe which are currently classified as narrow-line
emitters (Seyfert 2s) or LINERs.

anisotropies. Furthermore, we show how to take into account the particular case
of the shot noise terms in that framework. Eventually, we compute the CIB
angular bispectrum at 857 GHz and study its scale and configuration
dependencies, as well as its variations with the halo occupation distribution
parameters. Compared to a previously proposed empirical prescription, such
physically motivated model is required to describe fully the CIB anisotropies

signals potentially present at microwave frequencies, which hints that
detection of CIB NG should be possible above 220 GHz.

far-infrared and the sub-millimeter typical of the Planck/HFI and
Herschel/SPIRE instruments, 350, 550, 850, and 1380 um. We explore the
bispectrum behaviour as a function of several models of evolution of galaxies
and show that it is strongly sensitive to that ingredient. Contrary to the
power spectrum, the bispectrum, at the four wavelengths, seems dominated by low
redshift galaxies. Such a contribution can be hardly limited by applying low
flux cuts. We also discuss the contributions of halo mass as a function of the
redshift and the wavelength, recovering that each term is sensitive to a
different mass range. Furthermore, we show that the CIB bispectrum is a strong
contaminant of the Cosmic Microwave Background bispectrum at 850 um and higher.
Finally, a Fisher analysis of the power spectrum, bispectrum alone and of the
combination of both shows that degeneracies on the HOD parameters are broken by
including the bispectrum information, leading to tight constraints even when
including foreground residuals.

separation of 7.1'' (650 AU). It is confirmed to be comoving with its $13\pm2$
Myr-old F5 host using Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys

predict the companion's luminosity corresponds to a mass of $11\pm2 M_{Jup}$,
making it one of the most widely separated planetary-mass companions known. We
classify its Magellan/Folded-Port InfraRed Echellette $J/H/K$ spectrum as
L$2.5\pm1$; the triangular $H$-band morphology suggests an intermediate surface
gravity. HD 106906 A, a pre-main-sequence Lower Centaurus Crux member, was
initially targeted because it hosts a massive debris disk detected via infrared
excess emission in unresolved Spitzer imaging and spectroscopy. The disk
emission is best fit by a single component at 95 K, corresponding to an inner
edge of 15-20 AU and an outer edge of up to 120 AU. If the companion is on an
eccentric ($e>0.65$) orbit, it could be interacting with the outer edge of the
disk. Close-in, planet-like formation followed by scattering to the current
location would likely disrupt the disk and is disfavored. Furthermore, we find
no additional companions, though we could detect similar-mass objects at
projected separations $>35$ AU. In situ formation in a binary-star-like process
is more probable, although the companion-to-primary mass ratio, at $<1\%$, is
unusually small.

to the expansion of the real matrix near the topologically protected nodes in

nonlinear effects into account while performing spectral unmixing. These models
have been proposed empirically, however without any thorough validation. In

the full connection 1-form should be self-dual. Other two conditions,
expressing self-duality of a pair 2-forms occurring in the full curvature

find a family of self-dual solutions of the field equations. This is generated
by solving first a inhomogeneous wave equation on 1-forms in a classical curved

distribution of a galaxy sample. We are able to obtain a probability density
function (PDF) for each galaxy using a classification neural network. The
method is applied to 58714 galaxies in CFHTLenS that have spectroscopic
redshifts from DEEP2, VVDS and VIPERS. Using this data we show that the stacked
PDF's give an excellent representation of the true $N(z)$ using information
from 5, 4 or 3 photometric bands. We show that the fractional error due to
using N(z_(phot)) instead of N(z_(truth)) is <=1 on the lensing power spectrum
P_(kappa) in several tomographic bins. Further we investigate how well this
method performs when few training samples are available and show that in this
regime the neural network slightly overestimates the N(z) at high z. Finally
the case where the training sample is not representative of the full data set
is investigated. An IPython notebook accompanying this paper is made available

with central massive black holes and in the evolution of hierarchical triple
systems inspires a close examination of how post-Newtonian effects are
incorporated into N-body dynamics. The majority of approaches incorporate
relativity by adding to the Newtonian N-body equations the standard two-body
post-Newtonian terms for a given star around the black hole or for the close
binary in a triple system. We argue that, for calculating the evolution of such
systems over timescales comparable to the relativistic pericenter advance
timescale, it is essential to include ""cross terms"" in the equations of motion.
These are post-Newtonian terms that represent a coupling between the potential
of the central black hole and the potential due to other stars in the system.
For hierarchical triple systems, these are couplings between the potential of
the inner binary and that of the distant third body. Over pericenter precession
timescales, the effects of such terms can actually be ""boosted"" to amplitudes
of Newtonian order. We write down the post-Newtonian N-body equations of motion
including a central black hole in a truncated form that includes all the
relevant cross terms, in a format ready to use for numerical implementation. We
do the same for hierarchical triple systems, and illustrate explicitly the
effects of cross terms on the orbit-averaged equations of evolution for the
orbit elements of the inner binary for the special case where the third body is
on a circular orbit. We also describe the inspiration for this investigation:
the motion of a test body about a central body with a Newtonian quadrupole
moment, including the relativistic pericenter advance, whose correct solution
for the conserved total Newtonian energy requires including PN cross terms
between the mass monopole and quadrupole potentials.

converges under grid refinement even with very high volume fraction granular

coincide with multi-species gaseous contact surfaces without violating the

from multiphase shock tube problems, granular shocks, transmission angles of

we use a mass and environment dependent chameleon spherical collapse model, the

545 and 353 GHz, and IRAS 100 micron data. Using a modified black-body fit to
the data we present all-sky maps of the dust optical depth, temperature, and
spectral index over the 353-3000 GHz range. This model is a tight
representation of the data at 5 arc min. It shows variations of the order of 30
% compared with the widely-used model of Finkbeiner, Davis, and Schlegel. The
Planck data allow us to estimate the dust temperature uniformly over the whole
sky, providing an improved estimate of the dust optical depth compared to
previous all-sky dust model, especially in high-contrast molecular regions. An
increase of the dust opacity at 353 GHz, tau_353/N_H, from the diffuse to the
denser interstellar medium (ISM) is reported. It is associated with a decrease
in the observed dust temperature, T_obs, that could be due at least in part to
the increased dust opacity. We also report an excess of dust emission at HI
column densities lower than 10^20 cm^-2 that could be the signature of dust in
the warm ionized medium. In the diffuse ISM at high Galactic latitude, we
report an anti-correlation between tau_353/N_H and T_obs while the dust
specific luminosity, i.e., the total dust emission integrated over frequency
(the radiance) per hydrogen atom, stays about constant. The implication is that
in the diffuse high-latitude ISM tau_353 is not as reliable a tracer of dust
column density as we conclude it is in molecular clouds where the correlation
of tau_353 with dust extinction estimated using colour excess measurements on
stars is strong. To estimate Galactic E(B-V) in extragalactic fields at high
latitude we develop a new method based on the thermal dust radiance, instead of
the dust optical depth, calibrated to E(B-V) using reddening measurements of
quasars deduced from Sloan Digital Sky Survey data.

comprehensive analysis of the impact of a family non-universal $Z^{\prime}$
boson on $B_s-\bar{B}_s$ mixing and two-body hadronic B-meson decays, all being
characterized by the quark-level $b\to s$ transition. Explicitly 22 decay modes
and the related 52 observables are considered, and some interesting
correlations between them are also carefully examined. Firstly, the allowed
oases of $b-s-Z^{\prime}$ coupling parameters $|B^{L,R}_{sb}|$ and
$\phi^{L,R}_s$ are extracted from $B_s-\bar{B}_s$ mixing. Then, in the ""SM
limit""~({\it i.e.,} no new types of $Z^{\prime}$-induced four-quark operators
arise compared to the SM case), we study the $Z^{\prime}$ effects on $B\to\pi
K$, $\pi K^{\ast}$ and $\rho K$ decays. It is found that a new weak phase
$\phi^{L}_s\sim -90^{\circ}$ is crucial for resolving the observed ""$\pi K$ CP
puzzle"" and the allowed oases of the other $Z^{\prime}$ coupling parameters are
also strongly restricted. Moreover, the $Z^{\prime}$ effects on $\bar{B}_s\to K
K$, $K K^{\ast}$ and $\pi^0 \phi$ decays, being induced by the same quark-level
$b\to s q\bar{q}~(q=u,d)$ transitions, are also investigated. Especially, it is
found that the decay $\bar{B}_s \to \pi^0 \phi$, once measured, would play a
key role in revealing the observed ""$\pi K$ CP puzzle"" and probing possible new
physics hints. Finally, to check the non-universality of $Z^{\prime}$ couplings
to light-quark pairs, we have studied the $B\to \phi K$ decays in detail and
found that the left-handed $s-s-Z^{\prime}$ coupling is different from the

explains the origin of the flow force and offers a design solution to shape the
valve spool as a turbine bucket. It provides a model to calculate the

non-trivial example of that construction is one-loop amplitudes in N=2
super-Yang-Mills theory and the symmetric realization of N=4 matter-coupled
supergravity. Our approach is to use both field and string theory in parallel
to analyze these amplitudes. The closed string provides a natural framework to
analyze the BCJ construction, in which the left- and right-moving sectors
separately create the color and kinematics at the integrand level. At tree
level, in a five-point example, we show that the Mafra-Schlotterer-Stieberger
procedure gives a new direct proof of the color-kinematics double copy. We
outline the extension of that argument to n points. At loop level, the
field-theoretic BCJ construction of N=2 SYM amplitudes introduces new terms,
unexpected from the string theory perspective. We discuss to what extent we can

Using X-ray tomography, we analyze packings of frictional, oblate ellipsoids of
various aspect ratios $\alpha$, prepared at different global volume fractions
$\phi_g$. We find that $Z$ is a monotonously increasing function of $\phi_g$
for all $\alpha$. We demonstrate that this functional dependence can be
explained by a local analysis where each particle is described by its local
volume fraction $\phi_l$ computed from a Voronoi tessellation. $Z$ can be
expressed as an integral over all values of $\phi_l$: $Z(\phi_g, \alpha, X) =
\int Z_l (\phi_l, \alpha, X) \; P(\phi_l | \phi_g) \; d\phi_l$. The local
contact number function $ Z_l (\phi_l, \alpha, X)$ describes the relevant
physics in term of locally defined variables only, including possible higher
order terms $X$. The conditional probability $P(\phi_l | \phi_g)$ to find a
specific value of $\phi_l$ given a global packing fraction $\phi_g$ is found to
be independent of $\alpha$ and $X$. Our results demonstrate that for frictional

it was shown that in anisotropic dipolar magnetic insulators, the archetypal of

ferromagnetic and spin glass phases. The interplay between an applied
transverse field and the offdiagonal terms of the dipolar interaction produce
effective longitudinal fields, which are random in sign and magnitude as a
result of spatial dilution. In this paper we use exact numerical
diagonalization of the full Hamiltonian of Ho pairs in $LiHo_xY_{1-x}F_4$ to
calculate the effective longitudinal field beyond the perturbative regime. In
particular, we find that nearby spins can experience an effective field larger
than the intrinsic dipolar broadening (of quantum states in zero field) which
can therefore be evidenced in experiments. We then calculate the magnetization

protocols can produce direct measurement of the effective longitudinal field.

We consider leptogenesis in this class of models with all fundamental

universe vanishes. Such leptogenesis leads to equal and opposite lepton numbers
in the visible sector and in the dark sector, and thus also produces asymmetric

subsequently transfer to the baryonic sector via sphaleron interactions. The
stability of the dark particles is protected by the $U(1)_x$ gauge symmetry. A
kinetic mixing between the $U(1)_x$ and the $U(1)_Y$ gauge bosons allows for
dissipation of the symmetric component of dark matter. The case when $U(1)_x$

particularly interesting in that we have a gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$ which ensures
the conservation of $B-L$ with an initial condition of a vanishing $B-L$ in the

cool, resulting in its partial or total collapse into a smaller volume inside
the halo (e.g., a dark disk) as well as a reduced thermal velocity dispersion
compared to that of normal cold dark matter. We first show that these features
considerably relax the limits from direct detection experiments on the
couplings between standard model (SM) particles and dissipative dark matter. On
the other hand, indirect detection of the annihilation of the symmetric
dissipative dark matter component inside the Sun sets stringent and robust
constraints on the properties of the dissipative dark matter. In particular,
IceCube observations force dissipative dark matter particles with mass above 50
GeV to either have a small coupling to the SM or a low local density in the
solar system, or to have a nearly asymmetric relic abundance. Possible
helioseismology signals associated with purely asymmetric dissipative dark

an early-type galaxy can generally be well approximated by a power law $\sigma
\propto r^{\beta}$. However, some observed dispersion profiles show a deviation
from this fit at intermediate radii, usually between one and three
$R_{\mathrm{eff}}$, where the velocity dispersion remains constant with radius,
showing a bump-like behavior, which we term the ""$\sigma$-""bump. To understand
the origin of this $\sigma$-bump, we study a set of simulated early-type

simulated early-type galaxies, with the size and position of the bump slightly
varying from galaxy to galaxy, leading to the assumption that the bump is a
characteristic of the major merger formation scenario. The feature can be seen
both in the intrinsic and projected stellar velocity dispersions. In contrast
to shells that form during the merger event but evolve with time and finally
disappear, the $\sigma$-bump stays nearly constant with radius and is a
permanent feature that is preserved until the end of the simulation. The
$\sigma$-bump is not seen in the dark matter and gas components and we
therefore conclude that it is a purely stellar feature of merger remnants.

and on the way in which environment is measured. To distinguish competing
theories for the quenching of star formation, a robust and complete description
of environment is required, to be applied to a large sample of galaxies. The
environment of galaxies can be described using the density field of neighbours
on multiple scales - the multiscale density field. We are using the Millennium
simulation and a simple HOD prescription which describes the multiscale density
field of Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR7 galaxies to investigate the dependence of
the fraction of red galaxies on the environment. Using a volume limited sample
where we have sufficient galaxies in narrow density bins, we have more dynamic
range in halo mass and density for satellite galaxies than for central
galaxies. Therefore we model the red fraction of central galaxies as a constant
while we use a functional form to describe the red fraction of satellites as a
function of halo mass which allows us to distinguish a sharp from a gradual
transition. While it is clear that the data can only be explained by a gradual
transition, an analysis of the multiscale density field on different scales
suggests that colour segregation within the haloes is needed to explain the
results. We also rule out a sharp transition for central galaxies, within the
halo mass range sampled.

distinguished at small scales from a boost in the power spectrum from a
positive correlation between the density and neutral-fraction fields in

binning a subsample of 237 AGN with the best quality SEDs according to their
X-ray spectral parameters, their AGN sub-type and their luminosity, black hole
mass and Eddington ratio. The AGN sub-populations show some significant
differences in their SEDs; X-ray absorbed AGN show a deficit of emission at
X-ray/UV frequencies and an excess in the MIR consistent with absorption and
re-emission, radio-loud AGN show increased radio and X-ray emission, consistent
with the presence of a jet component in addition to the emission seen from
radio-quiet AGN and the SEDs of NLS1s only differ from other type 1s in the
X-ray regime, suggesting any physical differences are limited to their X-ray
emitting region. Binning the AGN according to underlying physical parameters
reveals more subtle differences in the SEDs. The X-ray spectral slope does not
appear to have any influence or dependence on the multiwavelength emission in
the rest of the SED. The contribution of X-rays to Lbol is lower in higher
luminosity sources, and relatively more emission in the optical/UV is seen in
AGN with higher Lx. Variations in the relative flux and peak frequency of the
BBB are observed and may suggest higher inner disc temperatures with increasing
accretion rates. Overall, we find that the diversity in the SED shapes is
relatively small, and we find no apparent single driver for the variations.

how to represent independent operations in any hidden variable model. We show
that PBR's assumption of independence encodes an assumption of local causality,
which is already known to conflict with the predictions of quantum theory via
Bell-type inequalities. We devise a weaker formulation of independence within a
general hidden variable model that is empirically indistinguishable from the
PBR assumption in situations where certain hidden variables are inaccessible.
Under this weaker principle we are able to construct an explicit hidden
variable model that is purely statistical and also reproduces the quantum

formation in galaxies becomes quenched, in order to segregate the accreted

simulations, we get a qualitative agreement between the CPPS distributions of
the passive and the accreted populations and also between the star-forming and

affects the pronounced cuspy profiles of the projected density and also, it can
explain the main difference (i.e. inner slope) between the CPPS distribution of
passive and accreted populations. The CPPS density of star-forming galaxies and
the intensity of ram-pressure stripping present an opposite trend throughout
the CPPS. This implies that ram-pressure stripping significantly contributes to
modulate the observed CPPS distribution of star-forming galaxies inside and
around cluster virial regions. The significant fraction of star-forming
galaxies at the projected center of clusters are mainly those galaxies with low

depend on the signal one is interested in. It is essential for any quantitative
signal estimation on the basis of the data. Here, we investigate
self-calibration methods for linear signal measurements and linear dependence
of the response on the calibration parameters. The common practice is to
augment an external calibration solution using a known reference signal with an
internal calibration on the unknown measurement signal itself. Contemporary
self-calibration schemes try to find a self-consistent solution for signal and
calibration by exploiting redundancies in the measurements. This can be
understood in terms of maximizing the joint probability of signal and
calibration. However, the full uncertainty structure of this joint probability
around its maximum is thereby not taken into account by these schemes.
Therefore better schemes -- in sense of minimal square error -- can be designed
by accounting for asymmetries in the uncertainty of signal and calibration. We
argue that at least a systematic correction of the common self-calibration
scheme should be applied in many measurement situations in order to properly
treat uncertainties of the signal on which one calibrates. Otherwise the
calibration solutions suffer from a systematic bias, which consequently
distorts the signal reconstruction. Furthermore, we argue that non-parametric,
signal-to-noise filtered calibration should provide more accurate
reconstructions than the common bin averages and provide a new, improved
self-calibration scheme. We illustrate our findings with a simplistic numerical
example.

predicts that our universe is one of many bubble universes nucleating and
growing inside an ever-expanding false vacuum. The collision of our bubble with
another could provide an important observational signature to test this
scenario. We develop and implement an algorithm for accurately computing the
cosmological observables arising from bubble collisions directly from the
Lagrangian of a single scalar field. We first simulate the collision spacetime
by solving Einstein's equations, starting from nucleation and ending at
reheating. Taking advantage of the collision's hyperbolic symmetry, simulations
are performed with a 1+1-dimensional fully relativistic code that uses adaptive
mesh refinement. We then calculate the comoving curvature perturbation in an
open Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe, which is used to determine the
temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background radiation. For a
fiducial Lagrangian, the anisotropies are well described by a power law in the
cosine of the angular distance from the center of the collision signature. For
a given form of the Lagrangian, the resulting observational predictions are
inherently statistical due to stochastic elements of the bubble nucleation
process. Further uncertainties arise due to our imperfect knowledge about
inflationary and pre-recombination physics. We characterize observational
predictions by computing the probability distributions over four
phenomenological parameters which capture these intrinsic and model
uncertainties. This represents the first fully-relativistic set of predictions
from an ensemble of scalar field models giving rise to eternal inflation,
yielding significant differences from previous non-relativistic approximations.
Thus, our results provide a basis for a rigorous confrontation of these
theories with cosmological data.

that there may be other sources that contribute to the ionization of hydrogen
aside from observable star forming galaxies. Often the calculated value of the
electron scattering optical depth, \tau_{es}, falls below the measurements
derived from observations of the CMB or an assumption about non-observable
sources must be made in order to reach agreement. Here, we calculate the
hydrogen ionization fraction as a function of redshift and the electron
scattering optical depth from both galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN)
factoring in the secondary collisional ionizations from the AGN X-ray emission.
In this paper we use the most current determination of the evolving hard X-ray
luminosity function and extrapolate its evolution beyond z = 6. The AGN
spectral energy distributions (SEDs) include both UV and X-ray ionizing
photons. To search for the largest possible effect, all AGN are assumed to have
\lambda_{Edd} = 1.0 and be completely unobscured. The results show that AGNs
produce a perturbative effect on the reionization of hydrogen and remains in
agreement with current constraints. Our calculations find the epoch of
reionization still ends at z \approx 6 and only increases the electron
scattering optical depth by ~2.3% under the most optimal conditions. This can
only be moderately increased by assuming a constant black hole mass of M_{BH} =
10^(5) solar masses. As a result, we conclude that there is a need for other
sources beyond observable galaxies and AGNs that contribute to the reionization
of hydrogen at z > 6.

detection signal than simple elastic scattering on nuclei. In a broad class of
well-motivated models the inelastic excitation of dark matter particles is
followed by de-excitation via $\gamma$-decay. In experiments with fine energy
resolution, such as many $0\nu 2\beta$ decay experiments, this motivates a
highly model-independent search for the sidereal daily modulation of an
unexpected $\gamma$ line. Such a signal arises from two-step WIMP interaction:
the WIMP is first excited in the lead shielding and subsequently decays back to
the ground state via the emission of a monochromatic $\gamma$ within the
detector volume. We explore this idea in detail by considering the model of
magnetic inelastic WIMPs, and take a sequence of CUORE-type detectors as an
example. We find that under reasonable assumptions about detector performance
it is possible to efficiently explore mass splittings of up to few hundreds of
keV for a WIMP of weak-scale mass and transitional magnetic moments. The
modulation can be cheaply and easily enhanced by the presence of additional
asymmetric lead shielding. We devise a toy simulation to show that a specially
designed asymmetric shielding may result in up to $30\%$ diurnal modulations of
the two-step WIMP signal, leading to additional strong gains in sensitivity.

relaxation (DS) of solutions involving mostly hydrophobic solute-water
interfaces. We study, by atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, the dynamics
and structure of hydration water interfacing N-Acetyl-leucine-methylamide

relaxation processes: bulk water, rotations of single solutes, and collective
dipole-induced-dipole polarizability of the solutes, with the time-scale of
130-200 ps. No separate DLS response of the hydration shell has been identified
by our simulations. Density fluctuations of the hydration layer, which largely
contribute to the response, do not produce a dynamical process distinct from
bulk water. We find that the structural perturbation of the orientational
distribution of hydration waters by the dipeptide solute is quite significant
and propagates 3-5 hydration layers into the bulk. This perturbation is still
below that produced by hydrated globular proteins. Despite this structural

undirected $n$-vertex graph $G$ such that all out-degrees are bounded. When the
graph $G$ is fully dynamic, i.e., admits edge insertions and deletions, we wish
to maintain such an orientation while keeping a tab on the update time. Low
out-degree orientations turned out to be a surprisingly useful tool, with
several algorithmic applications involving static or dynamic graphs.
  Brodal and Fagerberg (1999) initiated the study of the edge orientation
problem in terms of the graph's arboricity, which is very natural in this
context. They provided a solution with constant out-degree and \emph{amortized}
logarithmic update time for all graphs with constant arboricity, which include
all planar and excluded-minor graphs. However, it remained an open question
(first proposed by Brodal and Fagerberg, later by others) to obtain similar
bounds with worst-case update time.
  We resolve this 15 year old question in the affirmative, by providing a
simple algorithm with worst-case bounds that nearly match the previous
amortized bounds. Our algorithm is based on a new approach of a combinatorial
invariant, and achieves a logarithmic out-degree with logarithmic worst-case
update times. This result has applications in various dynamic graph problems
such as maintaining a maximal matching, where we obtain $O(\log n)$ worst-case
update time compared to the $O(\frac{\log n}{\log\log n})$ amortized update
time of Neiman and Solomon (2013).

partition of two sets of coordinates if the original distribution is the
product of the marginal distributions associated with these two sets. We focus
on the stationary distribution of a multidimensional semimartingale reflecting
Brownian motion (SRBM) on a nonnegative orthant. An SRBM is uniquely determined
(in distribution) by its data that consists of a covariance matrix, a drift
vector, and a reflection matrix. Assume that the stationary distribution of an
SRBM exists. We first characterize two marginal distributions under the
decomposability assumption. We prove that they are the stationary distributions
of some lower dimensional SRBMs. We also identify the data for these lower
dimensional SRBMs. Thus, under the decomposability assumption, we can obtain
the stationary distribution of the original SRBM by computing those of the
lower dimensional ones. However, this characterization of the marginal
distributions is not sufficient for the decomposability. So, we next consider
necessary and sufficient conditions for the decomposability. We obtain those
conditions for several classes of SRBMs. These classes include SRBMs arising
from Brownian models of queueing networks that have two sets of stations with
feed-forward routing between these two sets. This work is motivated by
applications of SRBMs and geometric interpretations of the product form
stationary distributions.

potentially affecting supermassive blackhole growth at high redshift in
cosmological simulations. These include numerical resolution, feedback
prescriptions and formulation of smoothed particle hydrodynamics. We find that
varying the size of the region over which feedback energy is deposited
directly, either for fixed number of neighbours or fixed volume makes very
little difference to the accretion history of blackholes. Changing mass
resolution by factors of up to 64 also does not change the blackhole growth
history significantly. We find that switching from the density-entropy
formulation to the pressure-entropy formulation of smoothed particle
hydrodynamics slightly increases the accretion rate onto blackholes. In general
numerical details appear to have small effects on the main fueling mechanism
for blackholes at these high redshifts. We examine the fashion by which this
occurs, finding that the insensitivity to simulation technique seems to be a
hallmark of the cold flow feeding picture of these high-z supermassive
blackholes. We show that the gas that participates in critical accretion
phases, in these massive objects at z > 6~7 is in all cases colder, denser, and
forms more coherent streams than the average gas in the halo. This is also
mostly the case when the blackhole accretion is feedback regulated (z < 6),
however the distinction is less prominent. For our resimulated halos, cold
flows appear to be a viable mechanism for forming the most massive blackholes
in the early universe, occurring naturally in LambdaCDM models of structure
formation. Not requiring fine tuning of numerical parameters, they seem to be
physically inevitable in these objects.

multinucleotide mutations (MNMs), complex events that generate SNPs at multiple
sites in a single generation. MNMs have the potential to accelerate the pace at
which single genes evolve and to confound studies of demography and selection
that assume all SNPs arise independently. In this paper, we examine clustered
mutations that are segregating in a set of 1,092 human genomes, demonstrating
that MNMs become enriched as large numbers of individuals are sampled. We
leverage the size of the dataset to deduce new information about the allelic
spectrum of MNMs, estimating the percentage of linked SNP pairs that were
generated by simultaneous mutation as a function of the distance between the
affected sites and showing that MNMs exhibit a high percentage of transversions
relative to transitions. These findings are reproducible in data from multiple
sequencing platforms. Among tandem mutations that occur simultaneously at
adjacent sites, we find an especially skewed distribution of ancestral and
derived dinucleotides, with $\textrm{GC}\to \textrm{AA}$, $\textrm{GA}\to
\textrm{TT}$ and their reverse complements making up 36% of the total. These
same mutations dominate the spectrum of tandem mutations produced by the
upregulation of low-fidelity Polymerase $\zeta$ in mutator strains of S.
cerevisiae that have impaired DNA excision repair machinery. This suggests that
low-fidelity DNA replication by Pol $\zeta$ is at least partly responsible for
the MNMs that are segregating in the human population, and that useful
information about the biochemistry of MNM can be extracted from ordinary
population genomic data. We incorporate our findings into a mathematical model
of the multinucleotide mutation process that can be used to correct
phylogenetic and population genetic methods for the presence of MNMs.

study the wormhole attack on a networked control system, in which an adversary
establishes a link between two distant regions of the network by using either
high-gain antennas, as in the out-of-band wormhole, or colluding network nodes
as in the in-band wormhole. Wormholes allow the adversary to violate the timing
constraints of real-time control systems by delaying or dropping packets, and
cannot be detected using cryptographic mechanisms alone. We study the impact of
the wormhole attack on the network flows and delays and introduce a
passivity-based control-theoretic framework for modeling the wormhole attack.
We develop this framework for both the in-band and out-of-band wormhole attacks
as well as complex, hereto-unreported wormhole attacks consisting of arbitrary
combinations of in-and out-of band wormholes. We integrate existing mitigation
strategies into our framework, and analyze the throughput, delay, and stability

selectively dropping control packets, the wormhole attack can cause
disturbances in the physical plant of a networked control system, and
demonstrate that appropriate selection of detection parameters mitigates the
disturbances due to the wormhole while satisfying the delay constraints of the

The question as to whether Problem (Tm) is in Class P or Class NP remains open.
So far, the only affirmative general result is that (T1) has an exact SOCP/SDP
reformulation and thus is polynomially solvable. By adopting an early result of
Martinez on local non-global minimum of the trust region subproblem, we can
inductively reduce any instance in (Tm) to a sequence of trust region
subproblems (T0). Although the total number of (T0) to be solved takes an
exponential order of m, the reduction scheme still provides an argument that
the class (Tm) has polynomial complexity for each fixed m. In contrast, we show
by a simple example that, solving the class of extended trust region
subproblems which contains more linear inequality constraints than the problem
dimension; or the class of instances consisting of an arbitrarily number of
linear constraints is NP-hard. When m is small such as m = 1,2, our inductive
algorithm should be more efficient than the SOCP/SDP reformulation since at
most 2 or 5 subproblems of (T0), respectively, are to be handled. In the end of

in particle physics, it is necessary to investigate carefully the divergence
structure in quantum field theories (QFTs) and work out a consistent framework
to avoid infinities. The divergence has got us into trouble since developing
quantum electrodynamics in 1930s, its treatment via the renormalization scheme
is satisfied not by all physicists, like Dirac and Feynman who have made
serious criticisms. The renormalization group analysis reveals that QFTs can in
general be defined fundamentally with the meaningful energy scale that has some
physical significance, which motivates us to develop a new symmetry-preserving
and infinity-free regularization scheme called loop regularization (LORE). A
simple regularization prescription in LORE is realized based on a manifest
postulation that a loop divergence with a power counting dimension larger than
or equal to the space-time dimension must vanish. The LORE method is achieved
without modifying original theory and leads the divergent Feynman loop
integrals well-defined to maintain the divergence structure and meanwhile
preserve basic symmetries of original theory. The crucial point in LORE is the
presence of two intrinsic energy scales which play the roles of ultraviolet
cut-off $M_c$ and infrared cut-off $\mu_s$ to avoid infinities. The key concept
in LORE is the introduction of irreducible loop integrals (ILIs) on which the
regularization prescription acts, which leads to a set of gauge invariance
consistency conditions between the regularized tensor-type and scalar-type
ILIs. The evaluation of ILIs with ultraviolet-divergence-preserving (UVDP)
parametrization naturally leads to Bjorken-Drell's analogy between Feynman
diagrams and electric circuits. The LORE method has been shown to be applicable
to both underlying and effective QFTs.

for linear elasticity on general polyhedral meshes, based on a strong symmetric
stress formulation. The key feature of this new HDG method is the use of a
special form of the numerical trace of the stresses, which makes the error
analysis different from the projection-based error analyzes used for most other
HDG methods. For arbitrary polyhedral elements, we approximate the stress by
using polynomials of degree k>=1 and the displacement by using polynomials of
degree k+1. In contrast, to approximate the numerical trace of the displacement
on the faces, we use polynomials of degree k only. This allows for a very
efficient implementation of the method, since the numerical trace of the
displacement is the only globally-coupled unknown, but does not degrade the
convergence properties of the method. Indeed, we prove optimal orders of
convergence for both the stresses and displacements on the elements. In the
almost incompressible case, we show the error of the stress is also optimal in
the standard L2-norm. These optimal results are possible thanks to a special
superconvergence property of the numerical traces of the displacement, and
thanks to the use of a crucial elementwise Korn's inequality. Several numerical
results are presented to support our theoretical findings in the end.

Boltzmann transport equation (GLBE) for the stationary collision density and
scalar flux about an isotropic point source in an infinite $d$-dimensional
absorbing medium with isotropic scattering. We consider both classical
transport theory with exponentially-distributed free paths in arbitrary
dimensions as well as a number of non-classical transport theories
(non-exponential random flights) that describe a broader class of transport
processes within partially-correlated random media. New rigorous asymptotic
diffusion approximations are derived where possible. We also generalize
Grosjean's moment-preserving approach of separating the first (or uncollided)
distribution from the collided portion and approximating only the latter using
diffusion. We find that for any spatial dimension and for many free-path
distributions Grosjean's approach produces compact, analytic approximations
that are, overall, more accurate for high absorption and for small
source-detector separations than either $P_1$ diffusion or rigorous asymptotic
diffusion. These diffusion-based approximations are exact in the first two even
spatial moments, which we derive explicitly for various non-classical transport
types. We also discuss connections between the random-flight-theory derivation
of the Green's function and the discrete spectrum of the transport operator and
report some new observations regarding the discrete eigenvalues of the
transport operator for general dimensions and free-path distributions.

and a fundamental scale of gravity that may be lower than the Planck scale by
several orders of magnitude. An interesting consequence of this scenario occurs
in the nature of spherically-symmetric vacuum solutions to the brane
gravitational field equations, which often have properties quite distinct from
the standard black hole solutions of general relativity. In this paper, the
spherically-symmetric collapse on the brane world of four types of null fluid,
governed by the barotropic, polytropic, strange quark ""bag"" model and Hagedorn
equations of state, is investigated. In each case, we solve the approximate
gravitational field equations, obtained in the high density limit, determine
the equation which governs the formation of apparent horizons and investigate
the conditions for the formation of naked singularities. Though, naively, one
would expect the increased effective energy density on the brane to favor the
formation of black holes over naked singularities, we find that, for the types
of fluid considered, this is not the case. However, the black hole solutions
differ substantially from their general-relativistic counterparts and brane
world corrections often play a role analogous to charge in general relativity.
As a possible astrophysical application of this work, the possibility that
energy emission from a Hagedorn fluid collapsing to form a naked singularity
may be a source of GRBs in the brane world is also considered.

from pattern detection first detects the locations of codeword symbols and then
uses them to decode. We introduce the concept of partial divergence and study
some of its properties in order to obtain stronger achievability results. As
the system becomes more intermittent, the achievable rates decrease due to the
additional uncertainty about the positions of the codeword symbols at the
decoder. Additionally, we provide upper bounds on the capacity of binary
noiseless intermittent communication with the help of a genie-aided encoder and

determine whether they are primordial accreted objects or collisional

active JFCs and compute the observed size-frequency distribution using a
Probability Index technique. The radii range from 0.2 to 15.4 km. This is then
corrected for the effects of observational selection using a model published
earlier by Meech et al.(2004). We estimate that the total number of active JFCs
between 0.2 and 15.4 km is approximately 2300.The active JFC size-frequency
distribution, over the range from 0.6 to 10 km where it is best defined, is
found to be closer to an exponential distribution in character than a
power-law. We then develop a statistical model, based on the assumption of a
steady state, for converting the distribution of active JFCs to the SFD of the
source population among the TNOs. The model includes the effects of
devolatization (that produces a large sub-class of defunct nuclei) and
surficial mass-loss. Comparison with available TNO observations shows that to
simultaneously attain continuity with the data on objects in the hot TNO
population (Fuentes et al,2010), satisfy constraints on the number of TNOs set
by the occultation detections of Schlichting et al.(2012), and to remain within
upper limits set by the Taiwanese-American Occultation Survey (TAOS; Zhang et
al,2013) the total JFC population must contain a large fraction of small
defunct nuclei. The effective power-law index of the inferred TNO differential
SFD between 1 and 10 km is -4.5 +/- 0.5 indicating a population in this range
that is not in fully relaxed collisional equilibrium. We conclude that the

properties of semiconductor thin films patterned with circular holes. The
presence of holes enhances the coupling of the incident plane wave with the
thin film and greatly enhances the absorption performance. For a typical 100 nm
thin film, the optimal hole pattern is achieved when the hole radius is 180 nm
and volume fraction is about $30\%$. Disorderness can alter the absorption
spectra and has an impact on the broadband absorption performance. The
non-uniform radius of holes can slightly broaden the absorption peaks and
enhance the integrated absorption. Random hole position can completely change
the shape of the absorption spectra and the averaged integrated absorption
efficiency is slightly smaller than the optimized ordered nanohole pattern.
Compared to random positioned nanoholes or ordered nanohole, amorphous
arrangement of nanoholes will result in a much better absorption performance.
However, it is also found that the absorption enhancement of amorphous pattern
over an ordered pattern is weak when the incident angle departures from normal

ultimate phase sensitivity. In the thermodynamic limit, we present analytical

tilt on external electric field and show that it can be eliminated, or even
reversed from its zero-field value. This is in good agreement with previous
experimental work on a system (W415) with a continuous Sm-A*--Sm-C* transition.
We also analyze, for the first time, the combination of bulk and surface
electroclinic effects in systems with a first order Sm-A*--Sm-C* transition.
The variation of surface tilt with electric field in this case is much more
dramatic, with discontinuities and hysteresis. Near each type of Sm-A*--Sm-C*
transition we obtain the temperature dependence of the field required to
eliminate surface tilt. Additionally, we analyze the effect of varying the
system's enantiomeric excess, showing that it strongly affects the field
dependence of surface tilt, in particular, near a first order Sm-A*--Sm-C*
transition. In this case, increasing enantiomeric excess can change the field
dependence of surface tilt from continuous to discontinuous. Our model also
allows us to calculate the variation of layer spacing in going from surface to
bulk, which in turn allows us to estimate the strain resulting from the
difference between the surface and bulk layer spacing. We show that for certain
ranges of applied electric field, this strain can result in layer buckling
which reduces the overall quality of the liquid crystal cell. For de Vries
materials, with small tilt-induced change in layer spacing, the induced strain
for a given surface tilt should be smaller. However, we argue that this may be
offset by the fact that de Vries materials, which typically have Sm-A*--Sm-C*

equations with two independent variables, MDC allows us to define an action on
arbitrary 2-dimensional surfaces embedded in a higher dimensional space of
independent variables, where the action is not only a functional of the field
variables but also the choice of surface. It is then natural to propose that
the system should be derived from a variational principle which includes not

derive the resulting system of generalized Euler-Lagrange equations arising

  on Signal Processing",,"10.1109/TSP.2014.2352604",,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Wireless energy transfer (WET) has attracted significant attention recently
for providing energy supplies wirelessly to electrical devices without the need
of wires or cables. Among different types of WET techniques, the radio
frequency (RF) signal enabled far-field WET is most practically appealing to
power energy constrained wireless networks in a broadcast manner. To overcome
the significant path loss over wireless channels, multi-antenna or
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques have been proposed to enhance
the transmission efficiency and distance for RF-based WET. However, in order to
reap the large energy beamforming gain in MIMO WET, acquiring the channel state
information (CSI) at the energy transmitter (ET) is an essential task. This
task is particularly challenging for WET systems, since existing channel
training and feedback methods used for communication receivers may not be
implementable at the energy receiver (ER) due to its hardware limitation. To
tackle this problem, in this paper we consider a multiuser MIMO system for WET,
where a multiple-antenna ET broadcasts wireless energy to a group of
multiple-antenna ERs concurrently via transmit energy beamforming. By taking
into account the practical energy harvesting circuits at the ER, we propose a
new channel learning method that requires only one feedback bit from each ER to
the ET per feedback interval. The feedback bit indicates the increase or
decrease of the harvested energy by each ER between the present and previous
intervals, which can be measured without changing the existing hardware at the
ER. Based on such feedback information, the ET adjusts transmit beamforming in
different training intervals and at the same time obtains improved estimates of
the MIMO channels to ERs by applying a new approach termed analytic center
cutting plane method (ACCPM).

convolutional-coded physical-layer network coding (PNC) systems. Specifically,
we put forth a layered decoding framework for convolutional-coded PNC
consisting of three layers: symbol realignment layer, codeword realignment
layer, and joint channel-decoding network coding (Jt-CNC) decoding layer. Our
framework can deal with phase asynchrony and symbol arrival-time asynchrony
between the signals simultaneously transmitted by multiple sources. A salient
feature of this framework is that it can handle both fractional and integral
symbol offsets; previously proposed PNC decoding algorithms (e.g., XOR-CD and
reduced-state Viterbi algorithms) can only deal with fractional symbol offset.
Moreover, the Jt-CNC algorithm, based on belief propagation (BP), is
BER-optimal for synchronous PNC and near optimal for asynchronous PNC.
Extending beyond convolutional codes, we further generalize the Jt-CNC decoding
algorithm for all cyclic codes. Our simulation shows that Jt-CNC outperforms
the previously proposed XOR-CD algorithm and reduced-state Viterbi algorithm by
2dB for synchronous PNC. For phase-asynchronous PNC, Jt-CNC is 4dB better than
the other two algorithms. Importantly, for real wireless environment testing,
we have also implemented our decoding algorithm in a PNC system built on the
USRP software radio platform. Our experiment shows that the proposed Jt-CNC
decoder works well in practice.

wireless power to all users via energy beamforming in the downlink (DL), and

and yet guarantee their rate fairness, we maximize the minimum throughput among
all users by a joint design of the DL-UL time allocation, the DL energy
beamforming, and the UL transmit power allocation plus receive beamforming. We
solve this non-convex problem optimally by two steps. First, we fix the DL-UL
time allocation and obtain the optimal DL energy beamforming, UL power
allocation and receive beamforming to maximize the minimum
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of all users. This problem is
shown to be in general non-convex; however, we convert it equivalently to a

applying the alternating optimization based on the non-negative matrix theory.
Then, the optimal time allocation is found by a one-dimension search to
maximize the minimum rate of all users. Furthermore, two suboptimal designs of
lower complexity are proposed, and their throughput performance is compared

Dust grains coagulate to form dust aggregates in protoplanetary
disks. Their porosity can be extremely high in the disks. Although disk
emission may come from fluffy dust aggregates, the emission has been modeled
with compact grains. Aims. We aim to reveal the mass opacity of fluffy
aggregates from infrared to millimeter wavelengths with the filling factor
ranging from 1 down to $10^{-4}$. Methods. We use Mie calculations with an
effective medium theory. The monomers are assumed to be 0.1 ${\rm \mu m}$ sized
grains, which is much shorter than the wavelengths that we focus on. Results.
We find that the absorption mass opacity of fluffy aggregates are characterized
by the product $a\times f$, where $a$ is the dust radius and $f$ is the filling
factor, except for the interference structure. The scattering mass opacity is
also characterized by $af$ at short wavelengths while it is higher in more
fluffy aggregates at long wavelengths. We also derive the analytic formula of
the mass opacity and find that it reproduces the Mie calculations. We also
calculate the expected difference of the emission between compact and fluffy
aggregates in protoplanetary disks with a simple dust growth and drift model.
We find that compact grains and fluffy aggregates can be distinguished by the
radial distribution of the opacity index $\beta$. The previous observation of
the radial distribution of $\beta$ is consistent with the fluffy case, but more
observations are required to distinguish between fluffy or compact. In
addition, we find that the scattered light would be another way to distinguish
between compact grains and fluffy aggregates.

eyebrows, lips, etc and their length and width ratio because it is difficult to
match photos and sketches because they belong to two different modalities. In
this system, first the facial features/components from training images are
extracted, then ratios of length, width, and area etc. are calculated and those
are stored as feature vectors for individual images. After that the mean
feature vectors are computed and subtracted from each feature vector for
centering of the feature vectors. In the next phase, feature vector for the
incoming probe face-sketch is also computed in similar fashion. Here, K-NN
classifier is used to recognize probe face-sketch. It is experimentally
verified that the proposed method is robust against faces are in a frontal
pose, with normal lighting and neutral expression and have no occlusions. The
experiment has been conducted with 80 male and female face images from
different face databases. It has useful applications for both law enforcement
and digital entertainment.

nodeless $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave state is supported primarily by the longitudinal
fluctuations on the electron pockets, and both transverse and longitudinal
fluctuations support nodeless odd-parity spin singlet $p-$wave symmetry on the
hole pockets. Our results may be relevant to the asymmetry of the AF/SC
coexistence state in the cuprate phase diagram, as well as for the ""nodal gap""
observed recently for strongly underdoped cuprates.

rates from nanoparticle. Calculations have been done for the step potential at
surface of spherical nanoparticle, and the simple model for the hot electron
cooling have been used. We highlight the effect of the discontinuity of the
dielectric permittivity at the nanoparticle boundary in the surface mechanism,
which leads to substantial (by 5 times) increase of photoelectron emission rate
from nanoparticle compared to the case when such discontinuity is absent. For
plasmonic nanoparticle, a comparison of two mechanisms of the photoeffect was
done for the first time and showed that surface photoeffect, at least, does not
concede the volume one, which agrees with results for the flat metal surface
first formulated by Tamm and Schubin in their pioneering development of
quantum-mechanical theory of photoeffect in 1931. In accordance with our
calculations, this predominance of the surface effect is a result of effective
cooling of hot carriers, during their propagation from volume of the
nanoparticle to its surface in the scenario of the volume mechanism. Taking
into account both mechanisms is essential in development of devices based on
the photoelectric effect and in usage of hot electrons from plasmonic
nanoantenna.

feature extraction technique to recognize human faces. Firstly, the new
morphological features i.e., features based on number of runs of pixels in four

features and LDP features that are less sensitive to the noise and
non-monotonic illumination changes, are extracted from the significant blocks
of the gradient image. Then these features are concatenated together. We
integrate the above mentioned methods to take full advantage of the three

star clusters are composed of groups of stars that formed in multiple episodes
with different chemical compositions. In this sense, it has also been argued
that variations in the initial helium abundance ($Y$) from one population to
the next are also the rule, rather than the exception. In the case of the
metal-intermediate globular cluster M4 (NGC 6121), recent high-resolution
spectroscopic observations of blue horizontal branch (HB) stars (i.e., HB stars
hotter than the RR Lyrae instability strip) suggest that a large fraction of
blue HB stars are second-generation stars formed with high helium abundances.
In this paper, we test this scenario by using recent photometric and
spectroscopic data together with theoretical evolutionary computations for
different $Y$ values. Comparing the photometric data with the
theoretically-derived color-magnitude diagrams, we find that the bulk of the
blue HB stars in M4 have $\Delta Y \lesssim 0.01$ with respect to the cluster's
red HB stars (i.e., HB stars cooler than the RR Lyrae strip)-- a result which
is corroborated by comparison with spectroscopically derived gravities and
temperatures, which also favor little He enhancement. However, the possible
existence of a minority population on the blue HB of the cluster with a
significant He enhancement level is also discussed.

cosine transform (DCT) together with an illumination normalization approach in
the logarithm domain that increase its robustness to variations in facial
geometry and illumination. Secondly in the same domain the entropy measures are
applied on the DCT coefficients so that maximum entropy preserving pixels can
be extracted as the feature vector. Thus the informative features of a face can
be extracted in a low dimensional space. Finally, the kernel entropy component
analysis (KECA) with an extension of arc cosine kernels is applied on the
extracted DCT coefficients that contribute most to the entropy estimate to
obtain only those real kernel ECA eigenvectors that are associated with
eigenvalues having high positive entropy contribution. The resulting system was
successfully tested on real image sequences and is robust to significant
partial occlusion and illumination changes, validated with the experiments on
the FERET, AR, FRAV2D and ORL face databases. Experimental comparison is
demonstrated to prove the superiority of the proposed approach in respect to
recognition accuracy. Using specificity and sensitivity we find that the best
is achieved when Renyi entropy is applied on the DCT coefficients. Extensive
experimental comparison is demonstrated to prove the superiority of the
proposed approach in respect to recognition accuracy. Moreover, the proposed
approach is very simple, computationally fast and can be implemented in any

on $\Omega$ into a sum of functions with support on the corresponding
macroelements. The transform is bounded in both $L^2$ and the Sobolev space

polynomial spaces. As a consequence, this transform is a useful tool for
constructing local projection operators into finite element spaces such that
the appropriate operator norms are bounded independently of polynomial degree.
The transform is basically constructed by two families of operators, local
averaging operators and rational trace preserving cut--off operators.

algorithmic graph theory. In 1994, Schrijver proved that the problem can be
solved in polynomial time for every fixed $k$ when restricted to the class of
planar digraphs and it was a long standing open question whether it is
fixed-parameter tractable (with respect to parameter $k$) on this restricted
class. Only recently, \cite{CMPP}.\ achieved a major breakthrough and answered
the question positively. Despite the importance of this result (and the
brilliance of their proof), it is of rather theoretical importance. Their proof
technique is both technically extremely involved and also has at least double
exponential parameter dependence. Thus, it seems unrealistic that the algorithm
could actually be implemented. In this paper, therefore, we study a smaller
class of planar digraphs, the class of upward planar digraphs, a well studied
class of planar graphs which can be drawn in a plane such that all edges are
drawn upwards. We show that on the class of upward planar digraphs the problem
(i) remains NP-complete and (ii) the problem is fixed-parameter tractable.
While membership in FPT follows immediately from \cite{CMPP}'s general result,
our algorithm has only single exponential parameter dependency compared to the
double exponential parameter dependence for general planar digraphs.
Furthermore, our algorithm can easily be implemented, in contrast to the
algorithm in \cite{CMPP}.

vectors $(\pi(1),\dots, \pi(n))$ for all permutations (bijections) $\pi$ over
$\{1,\dots, n\}$. We study a bandit game in which, at each step $t$, an
adversary chooses a hidden weight weight vector $s_t$, a player chooses a
vertex $\pi_t$ of the permutahedron and suffers an observed loss of
$\sum_{i=1}^n \pi(i) s_t(i)$.
  A previous algorithm CombBand of Cesa-Bianchi et al (2009) guarantees a
regret of $O(n\sqrt{T \log n})$ for a time horizon of $T$. Unfortunately,
CombBand requires at each step an $n$-by-$n$ matrix permanent approximation to
within improved accuracy as $T$ grows, resulting in a total running time that
is super linear in $T$, making it impractical for large time horizons.
  We provide an algorithm of regret $O(n^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$ with total time
complexity $O(n^3T)$. The ideas are a combination of CombBand and a recent
algorithm by Ailon (2013) for online optimization over the permutahedron in the
full information setting. The technical core is a bound on the variance of the
Plackett-Luce noisy sorting process's ""pseudo loss"". The bound is obtained by
establishing positive semi-definiteness of a family of 3-by-3 matrices
generated from rational functions of exponentials of 3 parameters.

data of a phase transformation. According to the method, the mean first-passage
time trajectories for the first $(i=1)$ as well as for the subsequent ($i=2$,
$3$, $4$, $\ldots$) nucleation events should be extracted, that allows one to
calculate the time-dependent nucleation rate, the critical value of the order
parameter (the critical size), the waiting times for the nucleation events and
the growth law of the nuclei -- i.e. all the terms, which are usually necessary
to characterize the overall transition kinetics. There are no restrictions in
the application of the method by the specific thermodynamic regions; and the
nucleation rate parameters are extracted according to their basic definitions.
The method differs from the Wedekind-Bartell scheme and its modification [A.V.
Mokshin, B.N. Galimzyanov, J. Phys. Chem. B {\bf 116}, 11959 (2012)], where the
passage-times for the first (largest) nucleus are evaluated only and where the
average waiting time for the first nucleation event is accessible instead of
the true steady-state nucleation time scale. We demonstrate an efficiency of
the method by its application to the analysis of the vapor-to-liquid transition
kinetics in water at the different temperatures. The nucleation rate/time

use the full likelihood analysis method, which provides optimal sensitivity to
characteristic gamma-ray spectral features, like those expected from dark
matter annihilation or decay. In particular, we focus our search on gamma-rays
produced from different final state Standard Model particles, annihilation with
internal bremsstrahlung, monochromatic lines and box-shaped signals. Our
results represent the most stringent constraints to the annihilation
cross-section or decay lifetime obtained from observations of satellite
galaxies, for masses above few hundred GeV. In particular, our strongest limit
(95% confidence level) corresponds to a ~500 GeV dark matter particle

the image to the source plane. The mass on each plane can be represented as
halos, simulation particles, a projected mass map extracted form a numerical
simulation or any combination of these. The image finding is done in a source
oriented fashion, where only regions of interest are iteratively refined on an
initially coarse image plane grid. The calculations are performed in parallel
on shared memory machines. The code is able to handle different types of
analytic halos (NFW, NSIE, power-law, etc.), haloes extracted from numerical
simulations and clusters constructed from semi-analytic models ({\small MOKA}).
Likewise, there are several different options for modeling the source(s) which
can be distributed throughout the light-cone. The distribution of matter in the
light-cone can be either taken from a pre-existing N-body numerical
simulations, from halo catalogs, or are generated from an analytic mass
function. We present several tests of the code and demonstrate some of its
applications such as generating mock images of galaxy and galaxy cluster

temperature: this is the reason for the transition to a deconfined phase in
Yang-Mills theory at temperature $T_c$. At high temperature $T \gg T_c$, the
smallness of the running coupling $g$ induces a hierachy betwen the ""hard"",
""soft"" and ""ultrasoft"" energy scales $T$, $g T$ and $g^2 T$. This hierarchy
allows for a very successful effective treatment where the ""hard"" and the
""soft"" modes are successively integrated out. However, it is not clear how high
a temperature is necessary to achieve such a scale hierarchy.
  By numerical simulations, we show that the required temperatures are
extremely high. Thus, the quantitative success of the effective theory down to
temperatures of a few $T_c$ appears surprising a posteriori.

builds intelligible statistical models for interpretable segments in the data,
in this case to explore the fatality rates associated with different
circumstances in the Afghanistan war. Our approach combines preprocessing by
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with model trees. LDA is used to process the
natural language information contained in each report summary by estimating
latent topics and assigning each report to one of them. Together with other
variables these topic assignments serve as splitting variables for finding
segments in the data to which local statistical models for the reported number
of fatalities are fitted. Segmentation and fitting is carried out with
recursive partitioning of negative binomial distributions. We identify segments
with different fatality rates that correspond to a small number of topics and
other variables as well as their interactions. Furthermore, we carve out the
similarities between segments and connect them to stories that have been
covered in the media. This gives an unprecedented description of the war in
Afghanistan and serves as an example of how data journalism, computational
social science and other areas with interest in database data can benefit from

the method depending on the choice of line search algorithm and on two free

showing that the OMM can achieve a noticeable speedup with respect to
diagonalization even for minimal basis sets for which the number of occupied
eigenstates represents a significant fraction of the total basis size (>15%).
We investigate the hard and soft parallel scaling of the method on multiple
cores, finding a performance equal to or better than diagonalization depending

of making use of the natural sparsity of the operator matrices for this type of

to do with changes in modes of thought that occurred with sedentism. According

final goal would be to understand the formation of the human mind. Several
scholars, however, affirm that climatic change was crucial to such a revolution

variations were due to so-called orbital forcing, the slow periodic changes of
orbital parameters of the Earth (known also as the Milankovitch theory). These

consequent impact on human evolution. The question then rises as to whether or

scales down to 100pc in the source plane of the galaxy. The velocity field

clear signature of a tidal tail. We constrain the age, reddening, SFR and
stellar mass of the star-forming clumps from SED modelling of the WFC3

properties from the OSIRIS data. With strong star formation driven outflows in
four clumps, RCSGA0327 is the first high redshift SFG at stellar mass <10^10
M_sun with spatially resolved stellar winds. We compare the H-alpha
luminosities, sizes and dispersions of the star-forming regions to other high-z
clumps as well as local giant HII regions and find no evidence for increased
clump star formation surface densities in interacting systems, unlike in the
local Universe. Spatially resolved SED modelling unveils an established stellar
population at the location of the largest clump and a second mass concentration
near the edge of the system which is not detected in H-alpha emission. This
suggests a picture of an equal-mass mixed major merger, which has not triggered
a new burst of star formation or caused a tidal tail in the gas-poor component.

generalized interaction potential between the two molecules. To obtain
expressions for the free energy, we use variational approximations for two

fluctuations in the braid radius. In the second case, where the interactions
are strong, the mean squared amplitude is self consistently calculated and the
effects of the intermolecular interaction on the twisting of the two molecules

different regions of the sample and find that scattering from the bulk fused

surfaces. To confirm that the bulk scattering is caused by Rayleigh scattering,
we perform a separate experiment, measuring the scattering intensity versus
input polarization angle. We estimate that 0.9--1.3\,ppm of the backscatter can
be accounted for by Rayleigh scattering of the bulk fused silica. These results
indicate that modern antireflection coatings have low enough scatter to not

upcoming Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs), i.e. GMT, TMT and E-ELT, and high

ELTs. With these simulations we extend previous studies by taking into account
atmospheric refraction in the transmission spectrum of the exo-Earth and
observational white and red noise contributions. Our studies reveal that the
number of transits necessary to detect the $O_2$ in the atmosphere of an Earth
twin around M-dwarfs is by far higher than the number of transits estimated by
Snellen et al. (2013). In addition, our simulations show that, when accounting
for typical noise levels associated to observations in the optical and
near-infrared, the $O_2$ A-band at 760 nm is more favorable to detect the
exoplanetary signal than the $O_2$ band at 1268 nm for all the spectral types,
except M9V. We conclude that, unless unpredicted instrumental limitations
arise, the implementation of pre-slit optics such as image slicers appear to be
key to significantly improve the yield of this particular science case.
However, even in the most optimistic cases, we conclude that the detection of
$O_2$ in the atmosphere of an Earth twin will be only feasible with the ELTs if
the planet is orbiting a bright close-by (d $\le$ 8 pc) M-dwarf with a spectral
type later than M3.

non-parametric probabilistic method of relating inputs to outputs, to survival
data consisting of time-to-event and covariate measurements. In this context,
the covariates are regarded as the `inputs' and the event times are the
`outputs'. This allows for highly flexible inference of non-linear
relationships between covariates and event times. Many existing methods, such
as the ubiquitous Cox proportional hazards model, focus primarily on the hazard
rate which is typically assumed to take some parametric or semi-parametric
form. Our proposed model belongs to the class of accelerated failure time
models where we focus on directly characterising the relationship between
covariates and event times without any explicit assumptions on what form the
hazard rates take. It is straightforward to include various types and
combinations of censored and truncated observations. We apply our approach to
both simulated and experimental data. We then apply multiple output GP
regression, which can handle multiple potentially correlated outputs for each
input, to competing risks survival data where multiple event types can occur.
By tuning one of the model parameters we can control the extent to which the
multiple outputs (the time-to-event for each risk) are dependent thus allowing
the specification of correlated risks. Simulation studies suggest that in some
cases assuming dependence can lead to more accurate predictions.

extracted from the Hough transformed significant blocks for efficient face

as feature in classification process. The efficiency of the proposed method is

feature of the Gabor wavelet transformation (GWT) with the local interactions
of the facial structures expressed through the Pseudo Hidden Markov model
(PHMM). Unlike the traditional zigzag scanning method for feature extraction a
continuous scanning method from top-left corner to right then top-down and
right to left and so on until right-bottom of the image i.e. a spiral scanning
technique has been proposed for better feature selection. Unlike traditional
HMMs, the proposed PHMM does not perform the state conditional independence of
the visible observation sequence assumption. This is achieved via the concept
of local structures introduced by the PHMM used to extract facial bands and
automatically select the most informative features of a face image. Thus, the
long-range dependency problem inherent to traditional HMMs has been drastically
reduced. Again with the use of most informative pixels rather than the whole
image makes the proposed method reasonably faster for face recognition. This
method has been successfully tested on frontal face images from the ORL, FRAV2D
and FERET face databases where the images vary in pose, illumination,
expression, and scale. The FERET data set contains 2200 frontal face images of
200 subjects, while the FRAV2D data set consists of 1100 images of 100 subjects
and the full ORL database is considered. The results reported in this
application are far better than the recent and most referred systems.

arbitrary phases and the presence of a constant gauge field is assumed. The
latter gives rise to Aharonov-Bohm-like effects on the expectation values. They
are periodic functions of magnetic fluxes enclosed by compact dimensions with
the period equal to the flux quantum. The current density has nonzero
components along compact dimensions only. Both low- and high-temperature

shown that at high temperatures the current density is exponentially

F=FeFp with multiple active slip systems, the uniqueness of the decomposition,
or the characterization of the plastic deformation without reference to the
so-called intermediate configuration. In this paper, we shed some light to
these issues via a two-dimensional kinematic analysis of the plastic
deformation induced by discrete slip surfaces and the corresponding dislocation
structures. In particular, we supply definitions for the elastic and plastic
components of the deformation gradient as a function of the active slip systems
without any a priori assumption on the decomposition of the total deformation
gradient. These definitions are explicitly and uniquely given from the
microstructure and do not make use of any unrealizable intermediate
configuration. These quantities are then passed to the continuous limit via
homogenization, i.e., by increasing the number of slip surfaces to infinity and
reducing the lattice parameter to zero. This continuum limit is computed for
several illustrative examples, where the well-known multiplicative
decomposition of the total deformation gradient is recovered. Additionally, by
similar arguments, an expression of the dislocation density tensor is obtained

often treated within the framework of the Langevin equation (LV), i.e. assuming
the momentum transfer is small or the scatterings are sufficiently forward
peaked, small screening mass $m_D$. We address a direct comparison between the
Langevin dynamics and the Boltzmann collisional integral (BM) when a bulk
medium is in equilibrium at fixed temperature. We show that unless the cross
section is quite forward peaked ($m_D\cong T $) or the mass to temperature
ratio is quite large ($M_{HQ}/T \gtrsim 8-10$) there are significant
differences in the evolution of the $p-$spectra and consequently on nuclear
modification factor $R_{AA}(p_T)$. However for charm quark we find that very
similar $R_{AA}(p_T)$ between the LV and BM can be obtained, but with a
modified diffusion coefficient by about $\sim 15-50\%$ depending on the angular
dependence of the cross section which regulates the momentum transfer. Studying
also the momentum spread suffered by a single heavy quarks we see that at
temperatures $T\gtrsim \, 250\,\rm MeV$ the dynamics of the scatterings is far
from being of Brownian type for charm quarks. In the case of bottom quarks we
essentially find no differences in the time evolution of the momentum spectra
between the LV and the BM dynamics independently of the angular dependence of
the cross section, at least in the range of temperature relevant for
ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Finally, we have shown the possible
impact of this study on $R_{AA}(p_T)$ and $v_2(p_T)$ for a realistic simulation
of relativistic HIC. For larger $m_D$ the elliptic flow can be about $50\%$
larger for the Boltzmann dynamics with respect to the Langevin. This is helpful
for a simultaneous reproduction of $R_{AA}(p_T)$ and $v_2(p_T)$.

around 0.1 bar in the atmospheres of Earth, Titan, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and
Neptune, despite great differences in atmospheric composition, gravity,
internal heat and sunlight. In all these bodies, the tropopause separates a
stratosphere with a temperature profile that is controlled by the absorption of
shortwave solar radiation, from a region below characterised by convection,
weather, and clouds. However, it is not obvious why the tropopause occurs at
the specific pressure near 0.1 bar. Here we use a physically-based model to
demonstrate that, at atmospheric pressures lower than 0.1 bar, transparency to
thermal radiation allows shortwave heating to dominate, creating a
stratosphere. At higher pressures, atmospheres become opaque to thermal
radiation, causing temperatures to increase with depth and convection to ensue.
A common dependence of infrared opacity on pressure, arising from the shared
physics of molecular absorption, sets the 0.1 bar tropopause. We hypothesize
that a tropopause at a pressure of approximately 0.1 bar is characteristic of
many thick atmospheres, including exoplanets and exomoons in our galaxy and
beyond. Judicious use of this rule could help constrain the atmospheric
structure, and thus the surface environments and habitability, of exoplanets.

level in the framework of a renormalizable scalar leptoquark model that forbids
baryon number violating processes and so is free from the strong constraints
from experimental data. In this model there are two scalar leptoquarks
accommodated in an $SU_L(2)\times U_Y(1)$ doublet: one of such leptoquarks is
non-chiral and has electric charge of $5/3e$, whereas the other one is chiral
and has electric charge $2/3e$. In particular, a non-chiral leptoquark
contributes to the weak properties of an up fermion via a chirality
flipping-term proportional to the mass of the virtual fermion and can also
induce a non-zero weak electric dipole moment provided that the leptoquark
couplings are complex. The numerical analysis is focused on the weak properties
of the $\tau$ lepton since they offer good prospects for their experimental
study. The constraints on leptoquark couplings are briefly discussed for a
non-chiral leptoquark with non diagonal couplings to the second and third
fermion generations, a third-generation non-chiral leptoquark, and a
third-generation chiral leptoquark. It is found that although the
chirality-flipping term can enhance the weak properties of the $\tau$ lepton
via the top quark contribution, such an enhancement would be offset by the
strong constraints on the leptoquark couplings. So, the contribution of scalar
leptoquarks to the weak magnetic dipole moment of the $\tau$ lepton are smaller
than the standard model (SM) contributions but can be of similar size than
those arising in some SM extensions. A non-chiral leptoquark can also give
contributions to the weak electric dipole moment larger than the SM one but
well below the experimental limit. We also discuss the case of the off-shell
weak dipole moments and for completeness analyze the behavior of the $\tau$
electromagnetic properties.

self-gravity of gas and dust is investigated by linear analysis. In the case
where the dust to gas ratio is enhanced and turbulence is week, the instability
grows, even in gravitationally stable disks, on a timescale of order $10^{4-
5}$yr at a radius of order 100AU. If we ignore the dynamical feedback from dust
grains in the gas equation of motion, the instability reduces to the so-called
""secular gravitational instability"", which was investigated previously as an
instability of dust in a fixed background gas flow. In this work, we solve the
equations of motion for both gas and dust consistently and find that
long-wavelength perturbations are stable, in contrast to the secular
gravitational instability in the simplified treatment. This may indicate that
we should not neglect small terms in equation of motion if the growth rate is
small. The instability is expected to form ring structures in protoplanetary
disks. The width of the ring formed at a radius of 100 AU is a few tens of AU.
Therefore, the instability is a candidate for the formation mechanism of
observed ring-like structures in disks. Another aspect of the instability is
the accumulation of dust grains, and hence the instability may play an
important role in the formation of planetesimals, rocky protoplanets, and cores
of gas giants located at radii $\sim$100 AU. If these objects survive the
dispersal of the gaseous component of the disk, they may be the origin of
debris disks.

correspondence. To this end, we study the behaviour of certain extremal
surfaces (focusing on those relevant for equal-time correlators and
entanglement entropy in the dual CFT) in a dynamically evolving asymptotically
AdS spacetime, specifically examining how deep such probes reach. To highlight
the novel effects of putting the system far out of equilibrium and at finite
volume, we consider spherically symmetric Vaidya-AdS, describing black hole
formation by gravitational collapse of a null shell, which provides a
convenient toy model of a quantum quench in the field theory. Extremal surfaces
anchored on the boundary exhibit rather rich behaviour, whose features depend
on dimension of both the spacetime and the surface, as well as on the anchoring
region. The main common feature is that they reach inside the horizon even in
the post-collapse part of the geometry. In 3-dimensional spacetime, we find
that for sub-AdS-sized black holes, the entire spacetime is accessible by the
restricted class of geodesics whereas in larger black holes a small region near
the imploding shell cannot be reached by any boundary-anchored geodesic. In
higher dimensions, the deepest reach is attained by geodesics which (despite
being asymmetric) connect equal time and antipodal boundary points soon after
the collapse; these can attain spacetime regions of arbitrarily high curvature
and simultaneously have smallest length. Higher-dimensional surfaces can
penetrate the horizon while anchored on the boundary at arbitrarily late times,
but are bounded away from the singularity. We also study the details of length
or area growth during thermalization. While the area of extremal surfaces
increases monotonically, geodesic length is neither monotonic nor continuous.

with the weak and hypercharge groups of the SM, and the Nambu-Goldstone boson
(NGB) has the quantum numbers of a SM Higgs. There is the intriguing
possibility of a connection with the vanishing of the Higgs self-coupling at
the Planck scale. Interestingly, with some minor assumptions (no vector-like
matter and minimal representations) and starting with a single quark doublet,
anomaly cancellation requires the matter structure of a generation in the SM.
Similar analysis holds in the $\mathbb{CP}^3$ model, with the unbroken group
identified with QCD and hypercharge, and the NGB having the up quark as a
partner in a supersymmetric model. This can motivate solving the strong CP
problem with a vanishing up quark mass.

properties, have been increasingly studied. The ability to fabricate
metamaterials has sparked an interest in determining possible applications. We
investigate using a metamaterial for boundary engineering in waveguides.
  A metamaterial-clad cylindrical waveguide is used to provide confinement for
an optical signal, thereby increasing the local electromagnetic energy density.
We show that metamaterial-clad waveguides have unique optical properties,
including new modes, which we call hybrid modes. These modes have properties of
both ordinary guided modes and surface plasmon-polariton modes.
  We show that for certain metamaterial parameters, the surface
plasmon-polariton modes of a metamaterial-clad waveguide have less propagation
loss than those of a metal-clad guide with the same permittivity. This low-loss
mode is exploited for all-optical control of weak fields. Embedding three-level
{\Lambda} atoms in the dielectric core of a metamaterial-clad waveguide allows
the use of electromagnetically induced transparency to control an optical
signal. Adjusting the pump field alters the group velocity of the signal,
thereby controllably delaying pulses.
  Using the low-loss surface mode of a metamaterial-clad guide reduces losses
by 20% over a metal cladding without sacrificing the group velocity reduction
or confinement. In addition, we show that losses can be reduced by as much as
40% with sufficient reduction of the magnetic damping constant of the
metamaterial.
  As this work aims for applications, practical considerations for fabricating
and testing metamaterial-clad waveguides are discussed. An overview of the
benefits and drawbacks for two different dielectric core materials is given.
Also, a short discussion of other modes that could be used is given.

theory, but pairing mechanism for doped Mott insulators still remains elusive.
Previously it has been shown by density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)
method that a single doped hole is always self-localized due to the quantum
destructive interference of the phase string signs hidden in the t-J ladders.
Here we report a DMRG investigation of hole binding in the same model, where a
novel pairing-glue scheme beyond the BCS realm is discovered. Specifically, we
show that, in addition to spin pairing due to superexchange interaction, the
strong frustration of the phase string signs on the kinetic energy gets
effectively removed by pairing the charges, which results in strong binding of
two holes. By contrast, if the phase string signs are switched off
artificially, the pairing strength diminishes significantly even if the
superexchange coupling remains the same. In the latter, unpaired holes behave
like coherent quasiparticles with pairing drastically weakened, whose sole
origin may be attributed to the resonating-valence-bond (RVB) pairing of spins.
Such non-BCS pairing mechanism is therefore beyond the RVB picture and may shed
important light on the high-T_c cuprate superconductors.

Integrin-based adhesions are modeled as harmonic springs, that pin the cell to
adhesive patches of a predefined geometry. Using Monte Carlo simulations and
analytical techniques we investigate the competing effects of bulk
contractility and cortical bending rigidity in regulating cell shapes on
non-adherent regions. We show that the crossover from convex to concave cell
edges is controlled by the interplay between contractile stresses and boundary
bending rigidity. In particular, the cell boundary becomes concave beyond a
critical value of the contractile stress that is proportional to the cortical
bending rigidity. Furthermore, the intracellular stresses are found largely
concentrated at the concave edge of the cell. The model can be used to generate
a cell-shape phase diagram for each specific adhesion geometry.

Erpenbeck in the 1960s. Working with the Zeldovitch-von Neumann-D\""oring (ZND)
model, he identified two fundamental classes of detonation profiles, referred
to as those of decreasing (D) and increasing (I) type, which appeared to
exhibit very different behavior with respect to high-frequency perturbations.
Using a combination of rigorous and non-rigorous arguments, Erpenbeck concluded
that type I detonations were unstable to some oscillatory perturbations for
which the (vector) frequency was of arbitrarily large magnitude, while type D
detonations were stable provided the frequency magnitude was sufficiently high.
For type D detonations Erpenbeck's methods did not allow him to obtain a cutoff
magnitude for stability that was \emph{uniform} with respect to frequency
direction. Thus, he left open the question whether the cutoff magnitude for
stability might approach $+\infty$ as certain frequency directions were
approached. In this paper we show by quite different methods that for type D
detonations there exists a uniform cutoff magnitude for stability independent
of frequency direction. By reducing the search for unstable frequencies to a
bounded frequency set, the uniform cutoff obtained here is a key step toward
the rigorous validation of a number of results in the computational detonation
literature. The main difficulty in the analysis is to treat ""turning points at

7 is about expressing the special $L$-values as periods (in the sense of

to the coexistence of inner and outer scattering processes and the trigonal

(ESM) are two related techniques that have had considerable success in
nano-scale probing of functional material properties. Both measure the strain
of the sample in response to a localized electric field beneath a sharp
conductive tip. In this work, a collection of commercially available glass
samples were measured with a variety of Si cantilevers coated with different
conductive metals. In some cases, these glasses showed significant hysteresis
loops, similar in appearance to those measured on ferroelectric materials with
spontaneous permanent electric dipoles. The magnitude of the electrochemical
strain and hysteresis correlated well with the molar percentage of sodium in
the glass material, with high sodium (soda-lime) glass showing large hysteresis
and fused silica (pure SiO2) showing essentially no hysteresis. The
elephant-ear shape of the hysteresis loops correlated well with it originating
from relaxation behavior, an interpretation verified by observing the
temperature dependent relaxation of the ESM response. Cation mobility in a
disordered glass should have a low diffusion constant. To evaluate this
diffusion constant, the temperature of the glass was varied between room
temperature and 200C. Vanishing hysteresis as the temperature increased was
associated with a decrease in the relaxation time of the electrochemical
response. The hysteretic behavior changed drastically in this temperature
range, consistent with bound surface water playing a large role in the
relaxation. This demonstrates the ability of ESM to differentiate cationic
concentrations in a range of silica glasses. In addition, since glass is a
common sample substrate for, this provides some clear guidance for avoiding
unwanted substrate crosstalk effects in piezoresponse and electrochemical
strain response measurements.

Station (BTS) room. So for the purpose of the development of cellular
communication a large numbered BTS rooms are installed throughout the world. To
ensure proper support from BTS rooms there must be a security system to avoid
any unnecessary vulnerability. Therefore multiple alarm system is designed to
secure the BTS rooms from any undesired circumstances. This system is designed
with a PIC Microcontroller as a main controller and a several sensors are
interfaced with it to provide high temperature alarm, smoke alarm, door alarm
and water alarm. All these alarms are interfaced with the alarm box in the BTS
room which provides the current status directly to Network Management Centre
(NMC) of a Global System for Mobile (GSM) communication network.

and composition mechanisms at the model level. Composition of multiple Aspects
will most likely result in more than one Aspect matching the same join points.
Consequently, Aspects do not always interact in a predictable manner when woven
together. Intended interaction among aspects is designed by the system
designer. Unintended interaction (or interference) must be automatically
managed. When the woven aspect demonstrates a behavior that is different than
its autonomous behavior, then this is a potential interference. Interference
has been recently reported in Aspect Oriented Software Development (AOSD) by
the industry. Leaving this problem unsolved may result in erratic software
behavior and will hinder the adaptation of AOSD by the industry. This
identified problem is similar to a phenomenon that exists in graph
transformation systems where multiple Graph Transformation rules share some
conflicting elements, it is referred to as Critical Pair Analysis and it
provides an algebraic-based mechanism to detect and analyze the interaction of
the rules. In this paper we propose a framework to detect unintended Aspect
interaction at the model level. The proposed framework transforms Aspects
modeled in UML State Diagram to Graph Transformation Rules, and then it applies
Critical Pair Analysis to detect unintended interactions among aspects. This
will enable developers to specify only the order of precedence for intended
interaction among aspects without the need to manually investigate unintended
interactions for the combinations of every Aspect to every other Aspect in the
system. The proposed interaction detection solution is automated, modular, and
independent of the base model; which adds the advantage of not having to
re-evaluate the interaction each time the base model changes.

as is carried in the surface energy bands, with the crucial advantage that the
topological properties of the bulk can be deduced from bulk calculations alone.
The distinct topological behaviors of these WCC sheets in trivial, Chern, weak,

simple tight-binding models. We then present the results of first-principles

$\diamond$-generalized Poisson process type I as a Markov process with the
$\diamond$-generalized Poisson distribution. Such processes have stationary
independent increments in the sense of generalized convolution, but usually
they do not live on $\mathbb{N}_0$. The $\diamond$-generalized Poisson process
type II is defined as a renewal process based on the sequence $S_n$, which is a
Markov process with the step with the lack of memory property. Such processes
take values in $\mathbb{N}_0$, however they do not have to be Markov processes,
do not have to have independent increments, even in generalized convolution

generalized convolutions which admit the existence of distributions with lack

ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with the direction of Centaurus A and IceCube
reported 28 neutrino-induced events in a TeV - PeV energy range, although none
of them related with this direction. In this work we describe the spectra for
each of the lobes, the main peak with synchrotron radiation, and the
high-energy emission with $pp$ interactions. Obtaining a good description of
the main peak, we deduce the magnetic fields, electron densities and the age of
the lobes. Describing successfully the $\gamma$-ray emission by pp interactions
and considering as targets those thermal particles in the lobes with density in
the range $10^{-10}$ to $10^{-4}\, {\rm cm}^{-3}$, we calculate the number of
ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. Although $\gamma$-spectrum is well described
with any density in the range, only when $10^{-4}\, {\rm cm}^{-3}$ is
considered, the expected number of events is very similar to that observed by
Pierre Auger Observatory, otherwise we obtain an excessive luminosity. In
addition, correlating the $\gamma$-ray and neutrino fluxes through pp
interactions we calculate the number of high-energy neutrinos expected in
IceCube. Our analysis indicates that neutrinos above 1 TeV cannot be produced
in the lobes of Centaurus A, which is consistent with the results recently

decoding in OFDM based Physical-layer Network Coding (PNC) systems. OFDM
signaling can obviate the need for tight time synchronization among multiple
simultaneous transmissions in the uplink of PNC systems. However, OFDM PNC
systems are susceptible to phase drifts caused by residual carrier frequency
offsets (CFOs). In the traditional OFDM system in which a receiver receives
from only one transmitter, pilot tones are employed to aid phase tracking. In
OFDM PNC systems, multiple transmitters transmit to a receiver, and these pilot
tones must be shared among the multiple transmitters. This reduces the number
of pilots that can be used by each transmitting node. Phase tracking in OFDM
PNC is more challenging as a result. To overcome the degradation due to the
reduced number of per-node pilots, this work supplements the pilots with the
channel information contained in the data. In particular, we propose to solve
the problems of phase tracking and channel decoding jointly. Our solution
consists of the use of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for phase
tracking and the use of the belief propagation (BP) algorithm for channel
decoding. The two problems are solved jointly through iterative processing
between the EM and BP algorithms. Simulations and real experiments based on
software-defined radio show that the proposed method can improve phase tracking
as well as channel decoding performance.

for automatic temporal segmentation is a specific statistical latent process
model which assumes that the observed acceleration sequence is governed by
sequence of hidden (unobserved) activities. More specifically, the proposed

challenge in the field of computational biology. If protein structure
homologues are not found, one has to construct 3D structural conformations from
the very beginning by the so-called ab initio approach, using some empirical
energy functions. A successful algorithm in this category, Rosetta, creates an
ensemble of decoy conformations by assembling selected best short fragments of
known protein structures and then recognizes the native state as the highly
populated one with a very low energy. Typically, an energy function is a
combination of a variety of terms characterizing different structural features,
say hydrophobic interactions, van der Waals force, hydrogen bonding, etc. It is
critical for an energy function to be capable to distinguish native-like
conformations from non-native ones and to drive most initial conformations
assembled from fragments to a native-like one in a conformation search process.
In this paper we propose a linear programming algorithm to optimize weighting
of a total of 14 energy terms used in Rosetta. We reverse the Monte Carlo
process of Rosetta to approach native-like conformations to a process
generating from the native state an ensemble of initial conformations most
relevant to the native state. Intuitively, an ideal weighting scheme would
result in a large ""basin of attraction"" of the native structure, which leads to
an objective function for the linear programming. We have examined the proposal
on several benchmark proteins, and the experimental results suggest that the
optimized weights enlarge the attraction basin of the native state and improve
the quality of the predicted native states as well. In addition, a comparison
of optimal weighting schema for proteins of different classes indicates that in
different protein classes energy terms may have different effects.

model is associated with a cluster, and within each cluster, each piecewise

two approaches for learning the model parameters. The former is an estimation
approach and consists in maximizing the observed-data likelihood via a
dedicated expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. A fuzzy partition of the
curves in K clusters is then obtained at convergence by maximizing the
posterior cluster probabilities. The latter however is a classification
approach and optimizes a specific classification likelihood criterion through a
dedicated classification expectation-maximization (CEM) algorithm. The optimal
curve segmentation is performed by using dynamic programming. In the
classification approach, both the curve clustering and the optimal segmentation
are performed simultaneously as the CEM learning proceeds. We show that the
classification approach is the probabilistic version that generalizes the
deterministic K-means-like algorithm proposed in H\'ebrail et al. (2010). The

stage (almost all of the considered carbon rich `21\,mu' stars belong to this
group); the group-II objects are massive or intermediate mass pAGB stars which
already follow the profound trend of PNe; and the group-III objects are mainly
low mass binary pAGB stars with very weak CO\,2-1 line emission (almost all of
the considered RV\,Tau variables belong to this group). The CO-IR diagram is
proven to be a powerful tool to investigate the co-evolution of circumstellar

originates from a Peierls distortion of the Mn chains. This distortion nearly
opens the gap at the Fermi level, but despite the strong dimerization and the

Hamiltonian for the conduction band using the L\""{o}wdin partition method from
the anisotropic two-band Hamiltonian with the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling of
the conduction band included. The spin-orbit coupling of the conduction band
induces the intra- and inter-valley D'yakonov-Perel' spin relaxation. In
addition, the Elliot-Yafet spin relaxation also takes place due to the
interband spin mixing. We find that the D'yakonov-Perel' mechanism dominates
the in-plane spin relaxation. In the framework of this mechanism, the
intravalley process is shown to play a more important role at low temperature
whereas the intervalley one becomes more important at high temperature. At the
temperature in between, the leading process of the in-plane spin relaxation
changes from the intervalley to intravalley one as the electron density
increases. Moreover, we find that the intravalley process is dominated by the
electron-electron Coulomb scattering even with high impurity density since the
dominant term in the spin-orbit coupling is isotropic, which does not lead to
the spin relaxation together with the electron-impurity scattering. This is
very different from the previous studies in semiconductors and graphene.

metastable state appears in the critical point in addition to the globally
stable state, so that when the interaction parameter exceeds a critical value,
two states coexist. One state has spin polarization and the other is
unpolarized. Another feature is that the spin polarization increases
continuously with the interaction parameter and has a square-root singularity

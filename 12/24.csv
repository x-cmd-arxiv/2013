mechanics a fundamental process leading to the perceived objectivity and called
state information broadcasting. This is the trick that Nature uses instead of a
simple cloning. We uncover it basing on minimal assumptions, without referring
to any dynamical details or a concrete model. More specifically, we show how a
crucial for quantum mechanics notion of non-disturbance due to Bohr and a
natural definition of objectivity lead to a canonical structure of a quantum
system-environment state, reflecting objective information records about the
system stored in the environment.

Marangoni-driven flow by continuously supplying isopropyl alcohol (IPA) on a

droplets create a localized depression in surface tension that leads to the
opening of a circular and thin region in the water film. At the edge of the
thin region, there is a rim growing and collecting the water of the film. We
find that the spreading radius scales as $r \sim t^{1/2}$. This result can be
explained from a balance between Marangoni and viscous stresses, assuming that
the gradients in surface tension are smoothened out over the entire size of the
circular opening. We derive a scaling law that accurately predicts the
influence of the IPA flux as well as the thickness of the thin film at the

recent past, but our understanding of the dynamics of emulsion formation is
still limited. For simple spherical particles, the time dependent growth of
fluid domains is dominated by the formation of droplets, particle adsorption
and coalescence of droplets (Ostwald ripening), which eventually can be almost
fully blocked due to the presence of the particles. Ellipsoidal particles are
known to be more efficient stabilizers of fluid interfaces than spherical
particles and their anisotropic shape and the related additional rotational
degrees of freedom have an impact on the dynamics of emulsion formation. In
this paper, we investigate this point by means of simple model systems
consisting of a single ellipsoidal particle or a particle ensemble at a flat
interface as well as a particle ensemble at a spherical interface. By applying
combined multicomponent lattice Boltzmann and molecular dynamics simulations we
demonstrate that the anisotropic shape of ellipsoidal particles causes two
additional timescales to be of relevance in the dynamics of emulsion formation:
a relatively short timescale can be attributed to the adsorption of single
particles and the involved rotation of particles towards the interface. As soon
as the interface is jammed, however, capillary interactions between the
particles cause a local reordering on very long timescales leading to a
continuous change in the interface configuration and increase of interfacial
area. This effect can be utilized to counteract the thermodynamic instability
of particle stabilized emulsions and thus offers the possibility to produce
emulsions with exceptional stability.

extragalactic background light and the intergalactic magnetic field. A
multi-wavelength study of this object centered around very-high-energy

three years, an 11.7 standard deviation detection and an average integral flux
F(E>300 GeV) = (23.3 +- 2.8_stat +- 5.8_sys) x 10^-9 photons m^-2 s^-1, or 1.7%

observations are combined with previously published Fermi observations and the
very-high-energy measurements to produce an overall spectral energy
distribution which is then modeled assuming one-zone synchrotron-self-Compton

the demonstrated variability of many TeV blazars, suggests that the use of

common view that superconductivity requires a large electron-boson coupling
$\lambda$ and therefore also a large $N(E_F)$. However, the generic Fermi
surfaces (FS) of these systems are relatively simple.
  Here is presented arguments showing that going from a 3-dimensional
multi-band FS to a 2-dimensional and simple FS is energetically favorable to
superconductivity. Nesting and few excitations of bosons compensate for a low
$N(E_F)$. The typical behavior of the 2-dimensional FS for cuprates, and small
3-dimensional FS pockets in doped semiconductors and diamond, leads to $T_C$
variations as a function of doping in line with what has been observed. Diamond
is predicted to attain higher $T_C$ from electron doping than from hole doping,

relaxation from turbulent states to highly coherent states of flow. For the
case of double spatial periodicity and zero total vorticity it is known that
the streamfunction verifies the \emph{sinh}-Poisson equation. These exceptional
states can only be identified in a description based on the extremum of an
action functional. Starting from the discrete model of interacting point-like
vortices it was possible to write a Lagrangian in terms of a matter function
and a gauge potential. They provide a dual representation of the same physical
object, the vorticity. This classical field theory identifies the stationary,
coherent, states of the $2D$ Euler fluid as derived from the self-duality. We
first provide a more detailed analysis of this model, including a comparison
with the approach based on the statistical physics of point-like vortices. The
second main objective is the study of the dynamics in close proximity of the
stationary self-dual state, \emph{i.e.} before the system has reached the
absolute extremum of the action functional. Finally, limitations and possible
extensions of this field theoretical model for the $2D$ fluids model are
discussed and some possible applications are mentioned.

large separations (high temperatures) which correspond to the classical limit.
It is shown that the free energy of the classical Casimir interaction between
two insulating films with no free charge carriers and between an insulating
film and a material plate depends on film thicknesses and decreases with
separation more rapidly than the classical limit for two thick plates. The free
energy of thin films characterized by the metallic-type dielectric permittivity
decreases as the second power of separation, i.e., demonstrates the standard
classical limit. The obtained results shed light on the possibility to describe
dispersion interaction between two graphene sheets and between a graphene sheet

obtained by describing the reflection properties on graphene by means of the

$\sim 3\times10^{43}$ erg/s and even at 850 days exceeds $10^{42}$ erg/s. A NIR
excess, dominating after 400 days, probably originates in dust in the
circumstellar medium (CSM). The total radiated energy is $> 6.5\times10^{50}$
ergs, excluding the dust component. The spectral lines can be separated into
one broad component due to electron scattering, and one narrow with expansion
velocity $\sim 100$ km/s from the CSM. The broad component is initially
symmetric around zero velocity but becomes blueshifted after $\sim 50$ days,
while remaining symmetric about a shifted centroid velocity. Dust absorption in
the ejecta is unlikely to explain the line shifts, and we attribute the shift
instead to acceleration by the SN radiation. From the optical lines and the
X-ray and dust properties, there is strong evidence for large scale asymmetries
in the CSM. The ultraviolet lines indicate CNO processing in the progenitor,
while the optical shows a number of narrow coronal lines excited by the X-rays.
The bolometric light curve is consistent with a radiative shock in an $r^{-2}$
CSM with a mass loss rate of $\sim 0.1$ M_sun/yr. The total mass lost is $> 3$
M_sun. These properties are consistent with the SN expanding into a CSM
characteristic of an LBV progenitor with a bipolar geometry. The apparent
absence of nuclear processing is attributed to a CSM still opaque to electron
scattering.

from the Fermi level. Consequently, Luttinger's band sum rule for the

disorder sets the length scale of the CDW order, for instance by pinning charge
density fluctuations or disrupting an otherwise long range order. Using

quenched oxygen disorder influences the CDW order parameter, the spatial extent

interest, due to their relevance in numerical analysis, and in applications
requiring matrix function approximations. In this paper we analyze the decay
pattern of the inverse of banded matrices in the form $S=M \otimes I_n + I_n
\otimes M$ where $M$ is tridiagonal, symmetric and positive definite, $I_n$ is
the identity matrix, and $\otimes$ stands for the Kronecker product. It is well
known that the inverses of banded matrices exhibit an exponential decay pattern
away from the main diagonal. However, the entries in $S^{-1}$ show a
non-monotonic decay, which is not caught by classical bounds. By using an
alternative expression for $S^{-1}$, we derive computable upper bounds that
closely capture the actual behavior of its entries. We also show that similar
estimates can be obtained when $M$ has a larger bandwidth, or when the sum of
Kronecker products involves two different matrices. Numerical experiments
illustrating the new bounds are also reported.

that are produced by plants as a defense mechanism against insect herbivores.
The analytical methodologies employed for their detection have come a long way
since the first analytical experiment and in the last 30 years had an enormous
development, both technological and experimental. It is notorious that before
the generalization of certain technologies, especially in a post-war
atmosphere, most scientific researches relied on what it is today thin-layer
chromatography. Nevertheless this technique was not sufficient for accurately
measure quantities and unambiguously identify compounds, therefore
spectroscopic techniques arose as well as chromatographic techniques. While the
first never really coped with PAs analysis requirements the latter, either as
gas or liquid chromatography allowed the analysis of complex sample matrices.
Simultaneously, nuclear magnetic resonance also suffered significant
developments while mass spectrometry has become an attractive technique due to
increasingly higher maximum resolutions. The observed tendency in recent years,
in pyrrolizidine detection and quantification, as well as in many other areas,
is that hyphenated techniques are the chosen methods. A large number of papers
report multihyphenated methodologies, and the overwhelming majority relies on
gas or liquid chromatography.

  Strategies on Twitter",,,,,"cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  Social media have substantially altered the way brands and businesses
advertise: Online Social Networks provide brands with more versatile and
dynamic channels for advertisement than traditional media (e.g., TV and radio).
Levels of engagement in such media are usually measured in terms of content
adoption (e.g., likes and retweets) and sentiment, around a given topic.
However, sentiment analysis and topic identification are both non-trivial
tasks.
  In this paper, using data collected from Twitter as a case study, we analyze
how engagement and sentiment in promoted content spread over a 10-day period.
We find that promoted tweets lead to higher positive sentiment than promoted
trends; although promoted trends pay off in response volume. We observe that
levels of engagement for the brand and promoted content are highest on the
first day of the campaign, and fall considerably thereafter. However, we show
that these insights depend on the use of robust machine learning and natural
language processing techniques to gather focused, relevant datasets, and to
accurately gauge sentiment, rather than relying on the simple keyword- or
frequency-based metrics sometimes used in social media research.

induces new, small-scale $B$-mode polarization. This signal carries detailed
information about the distribution of all the gravitating matter between the
observer and CMB last scattering surface. We report the first direct evidence
for polarization lensing based on purely CMB information, from using the
four-point correlations of even- and odd-parity $E$- and $B$-mode polarization
mapped over $\sim30$ square degrees of the sky measured by the POLARBEAR
experiment. These data were analyzed using a blind analysis framework and
checked for spurious systematic contamination using null tests and simulations.
Evidence for the signal of polarization lensing and lensing $B$-modes is found
at 4.2$\sigma$ (stat.+sys.) significance. The amplitude of matter fluctuations
is measured with a precision of $27\%$, and is found to be consistent with the
Lambda Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmological model. This measurement
demonstrates a new technique, capable of mapping all gravitating matter in the

on 2012 July 6 in NOAA AR 11515, which we found with Halpha observations of
0.1"" resolution from the New Solar Telescope and CaII H images from Hinode. The
flaring site is characterized with an intriguing ""fish-bone-like"" morphology
evidenced by both Halpha images and a nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF)
extrapolation, where two semi-parallel rows of low-lying, sheared loops connect
an elongated, parasitic negative field with the sandwiching positive fields.
The NLFFF model also shows that the two rows of loops are asymmetric in height
and have opposite twists, and are enveloped by large-scale field lines
including open fields. The two flares occurred in succession in half an hour
and are located at the two ends of the flaring region. The three ribbons of
each flare run parallel to the PIL, with the outer two lying in the positive
field and the central one in the negative field. Both flares show surge-like
flows in Halpha apparently toward the remote region, while the C9.2 flare is
also accompanied by EUV jets possibly along the open field lines.
Interestingly, the 12-25 keV hard X-ray sources of the C9.2 flare first line up
with the central ribbon then shift to concentrate on the top of the higher
branch of loops. These results are discussed in favor of reconnection along the
coronal null-line producing the three flare ribbons and the associated
ejections.

The approach is based on a record-prune-replay paradigm: all OpenGL calls
relevant to the graphics driver state are recorded; calls not relevant to the
internal driver state as of the last graphics frame prior to checkpoint are
discarded; and the remaining calls are replayed on restart. A previous approach
for OpenGL 1.5, based on a shadow device driver, required more than 78,000
lines of OpenGL-specific code. In contrast, the new approach, based on
record-prune-replay, is used to implement the same case in just 4,500 lines of
code. The speed of this approach varies between 80 per cent and nearly 100 per
cent of the speed of the native hardware acceleration for OpenGL 1.5, as
measured when running the ioquake3 game under Linux. This approach has also
been extended to demonstrate checkpointing of OpenGL 3.0 for the first time,
with a demonstration for PyMol, for molecular visualization.

relaxations obtained by the Sum-of-Squares method (Lasserre hierarchy). Our
approach is based on using the connection between these relaxations and the
Sum-of-Squares proof system to transform a *combining algorithm* -- an
algorithm that maps a distribution over solutions into a (possibly weaker)
solution -- into a *rounding algorithm* that maps a solution of the relaxation
to a solution of the original problem.
  Using this approach, we obtain algorithms that yield improved results for
natural variants of three well-known problems:
  1) We give a quasipolynomial-time algorithm that approximates the maximum of
a low degree multivariate polynomial with non-negative coefficients over the
Euclidean unit sphere. Beyond being of interest in its own right, this is
related to an open question in quantum information theory, and our techniques
have already led to improved results in this area (Brand\~{a}o and Harrow, STOC
'13).
  2) We give a polynomial-time algorithm that, given a d dimensional subspace
of R^n that (almost) contains the characteristic function of a set of size n/k,
finds a vector $v$ in the subspace satisfying $|v|_4^4 > c(k/d^{1/3}) |v|_2^2$,
where $|v|_p = (E_i v_i^p)^{1/p}$. Aside from being a natural relaxation, this
is also motivated by a connection to the Small Set Expansion problem shown by
Barak et al. (STOC 2012) and our results yield a certain improvement for that
problem.
  3) We use this notion of L_4 vs. L_2 sparsity to obtain a polynomial-time
algorithm with substantially improved guarantees for recovering a planted
$\mu$-sparse vector v in a random d-dimensional subspace of R^n. If v has mu n
nonzero coordinates, we can recover it with high probability whenever $\mu <
O(\min(1,n/d^2))$, improving for $d < n^{2/3}$ prior methods which
intrinsically required $\mu < O(1/\sqrt(d))$.

in the theory of relativity. The 'flow' results from the successive
happening/becoming of events along the time-like worldline of a material
system. This leads to a view of now as local to each worldline. Each past event
of the worldline has occurred once as a nowpoint, and we take there to be an
ever-changing present now-point 'marking' the unfolding of a physical system.
In Dieks' approach there is no preferred worldline and only along each
worldline is there a Newtonian-like linear order between successive now-points.
We have a flow of time per worldline. Also there is no global temporal order of
the now-points of different worldlines. There is, as much, what Dieks calls a
partial order. However Dieks needs for a consistency reason to impose a
limitation on the assignment of the now-points along different worldlines. In
this work it is made the claim that Dieks' consistency requirement is, in fact,
inbuilt in the theory as a spatial relation between physical systems and
processes. Furthermore, in this work we will consider (very) particular cases
of assignments of now-points restricted by this spatial relation, in which the
now-points taken to be simultaneous are not relative to the adopted inertial
reference frame.

function over a given polytope P. To solve such a problem in practice one needs
a concise description of the polytope P. In this paper we are interested in
representations of P using the positive semidefinite cone: a positive
semidefinite lift (psd lift) of a polytope P is a representation of P as the
projection of an affine slice of the positive semidefinite cone
$\mathbf{S}^d_+$. Such a representation allows linear optimization problems
over P to be written as semidefinite programs of size d. Such representations
can be beneficial in practice when d is much smaller than the number of facets
of the polytope P. In this paper we are concerned with so-called equivariant
psd lifts (also known as symmetric psd lifts) which respect the symmetries of
the polytope P. We present a representation-theoretic framework to study
equivariant psd lifts of a certain class of symmetric polytopes known as
orbitopes. Our main result is a structure theorem where we show that any
equivariant psd lift of size d of an orbitope is of sum-of-squares type where
the functions in the sum-of-squares decomposition come from an invariant
subspace of dimension smaller than d^3. We use this framework to study two

recent studies. In the present work, the problem of the interaction between

of the two approaches differ by approximately $10\%$ and can be fitted with a
multipolar expansion of odd negative powers of $d$; using one single term, a

interaction of an axion field with the axial-vector current generated by a
nucleon can give rise to time-dependent mixing of opposite-parity states in
nuclear systems. This mixing can induce oscillating electric dipole moments,
oscillating parity non-conservation effects and oscillating anapole moments in
such systems. By adjusting the energy separation between the opposite-parity
states of interest to match the axion mass energy, axion-induced experimental
observables can be enhanced by many orders of magnitude. Oscillating atomic
electric dipole moments can also be generated by axions through hadronic
mechanisms, namely the P,T-violating nucleon-nucleon interaction and through
the axion-induced electric dipole moments of valence nucleons, which comprise
the nuclei. The axion field is modified by the Earth's gravitational field. The

far resisted many attempts of formal analysis or positive constructions.
Specifically, we prove that, in Winfree's abstract Tile Assembly Model, when
restricted to use only noncooperative bindings, any long enough path that can
grow in all terminal assemblies is pumpable, meaning that this path can be
extended into an infinite, ultimately periodic path.
  This result can be seen as a geometric generalization of the pumping lemma of
finite state automata, and closes the question of what can be computed
deterministically in this model. Moreover, this question has motivated the
development of a new method called visible glues. We believe that this method
can also be used to tackle other long-standing problems in computational
geometry, in relation for instance with self-avoiding paths.
  Tile assembly (including non-cooperative tile assembly) was originally
introduced by Winfree and Rothemund in STOC 2000 to understand how to program
shapes. The non-cooperative variant, also known as temperature 1 tile assembly,
is the model where tiles are allowed to bind as soon as they match on one side,
whereas in cooperative tile assembly, some tiles need to match on several sides
in order to bind. In this work, we prove that only very simple shapes can
indeed be programmed, whereas exactly one known result (SODA 2014) showed a
restriction on the assemblies general non-cooperative self-assembly could
achieve, without any implication on its computational expressiveness. With
non-square tiles (like polyominos, SODA 2015), other recent works have shown
that the model quickly becomes computationally powerful.

La0.67Ca0.33MnO3 (LCMO) thin films with varying degrees of anisotropic strain.
The strain is induced via epitaxial growth on NdGaO3(001) substrates and varied
by controlling the thermal annealing time. An antiferromagnetic insulating
(AFI) state, possibly associated with charge ordering, emerges upon thermal
annealing. The Hall effect in these materials exhibits features that are
indicative of a percolative phase transition and correlate closely with the
emergence of the AFI state. In the paramagnetic phase, the Hall resistivity
takes on two slopes in all samples: a decreasing negative slope with increasing
temperature at low fields, which is attributed to the carrier hopping motion,
and an almost temperature independent positive slope at high fields due to
diffusive transport of holes. Significantly, the crossover fields of the Hall
resistivity slope at different temperatures correspond to the same
magnetization, which is interpreted as the critical point of a magnetic
field-driven percolative phase transition. At lower temperatures near the
zero-field metal-insulator transition, pronounced enhancement of the Hall
coefficient with the development of the AFI state is observed. The enhancement
peaks near the magnetic field-driven percolation; its magnitude correlates with
the strength of the AFI state and is suppressed with the melting of the AFI
state by an in-plane magnetic field. The observations resemble many features of
the enhancement of the Hall coefficient in granular metal films near the
composition-driven percolation.

pc of the Galactic Center. The main explanations proposed for this are: an
unresolved population of millisecond pulsars (MSPs), dark matter (DM)
annihilation, and nonthermal bremsstrahlung produced by a population of
electrons interacting with neutral gas in molecular clouds. The first two
options have spatial templates well fitted by the square of a generalized
Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile with inner slope $\gamma=1.2$. We model the
third option with a 20-cm continuum emission Galactic Ridge template. A
template based on the HESS residuals is shown to give similar results. The
gamma-ray excess is found to be best fit by a combination of the generalized
NFW squared template and a Galactic Ridge template. We also find the spectra of
each template is not significantly affected in the combined fit and is
consistent with previous single template fits. That is the generalized NFW
squared spectrum can be fit by either of order 1000 unresolved MSPs or DM with
mass around 30 GeV, a thermal cross section, and mainly annihilating to $b
\bar{b}$ quarks. While the Galactic Ridge continues to have a spectrum
consistent with a population of nonthermal electrons whose spectrum also
provides a good fit to synchrotron emission measurements. We also show that the
current DM fit may be hard to test, even with 10 years of Fermi-LAT data,
especially if there is a mixture of DM and MSPs contributing to the signal, in
which case the implied DM cross section will be suppressed.

Au$+$Au, $\mean{d\Et/d\eta}/N_{\rm part}$ increases with $N_{\rm part}$, while
$\mean{d\Et/d\eta}/N_{qp}$ is approximately constant for all three energies.
This indicates that the two component ansatz, $dE_{T}/d\eta \propto (1-x)
N_{\rm part}/2 + x N_{\rm coll}$, which has been used to represent $E_T$
distributions, is simply a proxy for $N_{qp}$, and that the $N_{\rm coll}$ term
does not represent a hard-scattering component in $E_T$ distributions. The
$dE_{T}/d\eta$ distributions of Au$+$Au and $d$$+$Au are then calculated from
the measured $p$$+$$p$ $E_T$ distribution using two models that both reproduce
the Au$+$Au data. However, while the number-of-constituent-quark-participant
model agrees well with the $d$$+$Au data, the additive-quark model does not.

parallelizable and amenable to linear algebraic techniques for accelerating the

characterized by the solution graph, where the vertices are the solutions, and
two solutions are connected iff they differ in exactly one variable. In 2006,
Gopalan et al. studied connectivity properties of the solution graph and
related complexity issues for CSPs, motivated mainly by research on
satisfiability algorithms and the satisfiability threshold. They proved
dichotomies for the diameter of connected components and for the complexity of
the st-connectivity question, and conjectured a trichotomy for the connectivity
question. Recently, we were able to establish the trichotomy [arXiv:1312.4524].
  Here, we consider connectivity issues of satisfiability problems defined by
Boolean circuits and propositional formulas that use gates, resp. connectives,
from a fixed set of Boolean functions. We obtain dichotomies for the diameter
and the two connectivity problems: on one side, the diameter is linear in the
number of variables, and both problems are in P, while on the other side, the
diameter can be exponential, and the problems are PSPACE-complete. For
partially quantified formulas, we show an analogous dichotomy.

theory. In addition, when the central charge is rational, we find a new class
of M5-branes with a moduli space that includes two internal dimensions in
addition to the Riemann surface. These new M5-branes have the essential
characteristic of fractional branes, in that a single one at a generic point of
its moduli space becomes multiple M5-branes at special points.

offsets in the broad Balmer lines with respect to the systemic redshift of the
host galaxy. Models to explain these offsets usually invoke broad-line region
gas kinematics/asymmetry around single black holes (BHs), orbital motion of
massive (~sub-pc) binary black holes (BBHs), or recoil BHs, but single-epoch
spectra are unable to distinguish between these scenarios. The line-of-sight
(LOS) radial velocity (RV) shifts from long-term spectroscopic monitoring can
be used to test the BBH hypothesis. We have selected a sample of 399 quasars
with offset broad H-beta lines from the SDSS DR7 quasar catalog, and have
conducted second-epoch optical spectroscopy for 50 of them. Combined with the
existing SDSS spectra, the new observations enable us to constrain the LOS RV
shifts of broad H-beta lines with a rest-frame baseline of a few years to
nearly a decade. Using cross-correlation analysis, we detect significant (99%
confidence) radial accelerations in the broad H-beta lines in 24 of the 50
objects. We suggest that 9 of the 24 detections are sub-pc BBH candidates,
which show consistent velocity shifts independently measured from a second
broad line (either H-alpha or Mg II) without significant changes in the
broad-line profiles. Combining the results on the general quasar population
studied in Paper I, we find a tentative anti-correlation between the velocity
offset in the first-epoch spectrum and the average acceleration between two
epochs, which could be explained by orbital phase modulation when the time
separation between two epochs is a non-negligible fraction of the orbital
period of the motion causing the line displacement. We discuss the implications
of our results for the identification of sub-pc BBH candidates in offset-line
quasars and for the constraints on their frequency and orbital parameters.

supersymmetric grand unified symmetry spontaneously broken by a vacuum
expectation value <\Sigma>, if superpotential interactions for \Sigma are
forbidden e.g. by R symmetries, the uneaten color octet, \Sigma_8, and weak

unification, removing the disastrously high proton decay rate of minimal
Standard Model unification. Proton decay could be seen in future experiments if
\tilde{m} ~ 10^{11} GeV, but not if it is lower. If the reheating temperature

a TeV-scale LSP, either wino or Higgsino, which could comprise all or just one

behave inelastically in direct detection experiments, and gauge coupling
unification occurs accurately without the need of any threshold corrections.

detecting synchrotron radio emission at 1.4 and 5 GHz, and the higher frequency
(future ALMA and present MSX, SPITZER, PLANCK, WISE) 0.1-100 THz infrared
surveys that detect thermal radiation. The 15 GHz band appears to be the
highest frequency at which such a survey is both feasible and maximally unique
from the synchrotron radio view and will facilitate new multi-waveband Galactic
research and, for example, identify targets for ALMA. Depending on the final
survey parameters, for example a 3 second integration time for a (8-sigma) 1
mJy 12-18 GHz detection limit over a 10 degree band along the VLA observable
(280 degree) Galactic plane, this survey would consume up to 3200 VLA observing
hours using on-the-fly mapping and still allow for, e.g., an additional sub-Jy
sensitive 12.2 GHz methanol maser line survey. Furthermore this survey would
reveal potential compact high-frequency VLA calibrators in the Galactic bulge

to hold: a numerical approximation solution should be in some sense as smooth
as its target exact solution in order to have optimal convergence. For

smoothness in the interiors as well as across the interfaces of cells or
elements. In this paper we give clear definitions of numerical smoothness that
address the across-interface smoothness in terms of scaled jumps in derivatives
[9] and the interior numerical smoothness in terms of differences in derivative

stated as numerical smoothness is necessary for optimal order convergence. It
is valid on quasi-uniform meshes by triangles and quadrilaterals in two
dimensions and by tetrahedrons and hexahedrons in three dimensions. With this
validation we can justify, among other things, incorporation of this principle
in creating adaptive numerical approximation for the solution of PDEs or ODEs,

fashion, whereby requests contain specifics of the information desired while

force individuals to prioritize some while neglecting others. This dilemma will
inevitably force individuals into defecting against some communication partners
to give attention to others. Furthermore, communication entirely breaks down
when individuals act purely egoistically as replies would never be issued and
quest for desired information would always be prioritized. Here we present an
experiment, termed ""The expert game"", where a number of individuals communicate
with one-another through an electronic messaging system. By imposing a strict
limit on the number of sent messages, individuals were required to decide
between requesting information that is beneficial for themselves or helping
others by replying to their requests. In the experiment, individuals were
assigned the task to find the expert on a specific topic and receive a reply
from that expert. Tasks and expertise of each player were periodically
re-assigned to randomize the required interactions. Resisting this
randomization, a non-random network of cooperative communication between
individuals formed. We use a simple Bayesian inference algorithm to model each
player's trust in the cooperativity of others with good experimental agreement.
Our results suggest that human communication in groups of individuals is
strategic and favors cooperation with trusted parties at the cost of defection
against others. To establish and maintain trusted links a significant fraction

the advantage of studying weighted measures of multiplex networks, such as

metrics near each black hole to a two-body post-Newtonian metric far from them,

done without linearizing about a particular time slice, and thus it is valid

its linearity. Unlike traditional experiments dealing with interactions between

resolution that can be extracted from \emph{in vivo} single-molecule
measurements. This enables researchers to quantitatively infer the magnitude
and directionality of forces experienced by biomolecules in their native
cellular environments. Situations where such forces are biologically relevant
range from mitosis to directed transport of protein cargo along cytoskeletal
structures. Models commonly applied to quantify single-molecule dynamics assume
that effective forces and velocity in the $x,y$ (or $x,y,z$) directions are
statistically independent, but this assumption is physically unrealistic in
many situations. We present a hypothesis testing approach capable of
determining if there is evidence of statistical dependence between positional
coordinates in experimentally measured trajectories; if the hypothesis of
independence between spatial coordinates is rejected, then a new model
accounting for 2D (3D) interactions should be considered to more faithfully
represent the underlying experimental kinetics. The technique is robust in the
sense that 2D (3D) interactions can be detected via statistical hypothesis
testing even if there is substantial inconsistency between the physical
particle's actual noise sources and the simplified model's assumed noise
structure. For example, 2D (3D) interactions can be reliably detected even if
the researcher assumes normal diffusion, but the experimental data experiences
""anomalous diffusion"" and/or is subjected to a measurement noise characterized
by a distribution differing from that assumed by the fitted model. The approach
is demonstrated on control simulations and on experimental data (IFT88 directed

proposed approach offers the flexibility of assigning different levels of
importance to base station (BS) and mobile terminal (MT) power consumption,
corresponding to the BS being connected to the grid and the MT relying on

consider two extreme cases separately, i.e., weighted-sum receiver-side energy
minimization (WSREMin) for MTs and transmitter-side energy minimization (TEMin)
for the BS. It is shown that Dynamic TDMA (D-TDMA), where MTs are scheduled for
single-user OFDM transmissions over orthogonal time slots, is the optimal
transmission strategy for WSREMin at MTs, while OFDMA is optimal for TEMin at
the BS. As a hybrid of the two extreme cases, we further propose a new multiple
access scheme, i.e., Time-Slotted OFDMA (TS-OFDMA) scheme, in which MTs are
grouped into orthogonal time slots with OFDMA applied to users assigned within
the same slot. TS-OFDMA can be shown to include both D-TDMA and OFDMA as

also dopes electrons into the FePn layer to induce superconductivity. Isovalent
phosphorus substitution (P3- -> As3-) can induce only a chemical pressure
effect, i.e., an increase of {\alpha} for La-substitution of Sm-sites. As y

the initial velocity is small in $L^2$ and bounded in $L^p$, for some $p>2$.
While the assumption on the initial deformation gradient is automatically
satisfied for the classical Oldroyd-B model, the additional assumption on the
initial velocity being bounded in $L^p$ for some $p>2$ may due to techniques we
employed. The smallness assumption on the $L^2$ norm of the initial velocity
is, however, natural for the global well-posedness . One of the key
observations in the paper is that the velocity and the \textquotedblleft

the pointwise estimate for the deformation gradient without using $L^\infty$

boundary integral equations (BIE), this method leads to a reduction in
dimensionality (from volume to surface) of the discretization region. However,
as opposed to BIE, the proposed technique leads to boundary integral equations
with smooth kernels. Hence, these Fredholm integral equations can be handled
accurately and robustly with standard numerical approaches without the need to
remove singularities. Moreover, under weak scattering conditions, this approach
renders a convergent iterative method which bypasses the need to solve single
scattering problems at each iteration.
  Inherited from the original OSRC, the proposed multiple-OSRC is generally a
crude approximate method. If accuracy is not satisfactory, this approach may
serve as a good initial guess or as an inexpensive pre-conditioner for Krylov

GRO J1008-57 are studied with INTEGRAL observations. The pulsation periods at
93.66 s in 2004 and at 93.73 s in 2009 are determined. Pulse profiles of GRO
J1008-57 during outbursts are energy dependent: double-peak profile in soft
bands of 3-7 keV and single-peak profile in hard X-rays above 7 keV. GRO
J1008-57 has undergone a spin-down trend from 1993-2009 with a rate of
4.1x10^-5 s day^-1, and might transfer into a spin-up trend after 2009. The
spectra from 3-100 keV of GRO J1008-57 during outbursts are fitted with photon
index of 1.4 and cutoff energies of 23-29 keV. We find a relatively soft
spectrum in early phase of the 2009 outburst with cutoff energy 13 keV. Above a
hard X-ray flux of 10^-9 erg cm^-2 s^-1, the spectra of GRO J1008-57 during
outbursts need an enhanced hydrogen absorption of column density 6x10^22 cm^-2.
The observed dip-like pulse profile of GRO J1008-57 in soft X-ray bands should
be caused by this intrinsic absorption. Around the outburst peaks, a possible
cyclotron resonance scattering feature at 74 keV is detected in the spectra of
GRO J1008-57, making the source as the neutron star of highest magnetic field
(6.6x10^12 G) in known accreting X-ray pulsars. Two modulations periods at
124.38 and 248.78 days are found using RXTE/ASM light curves of GRO J1008-57.
Two flare peaks appearing in the folded light curve have different spectral
properties. The normal outburst lasting 0.1 orbital phase has a hard spectrum
and cannot be detected below 3 keV. The second flare lasting ten days shows a
very soft spectrum without significant detections above 5 keV. Lack of soft
X-ray emissions in outbursts should be caused by the enhanced hydrogen
absorption near the periastron passage. Soft spectral origins in the second
flares still need further detailed studies with soft X-ray spectroscopies.

full consideration of all sources of uncertainty. We demonstrate the

correction for land-level change shows the 2000 AD rate of rise to have a

fractional level. For n=1, these are the logarithmic minimal models LM(P,P').
For n>1, we argue that these critical theories are realized on the lattice by n
x n fusion of the n=1 models. For n=2, we call them logarithmic superconformal
minimal models LSM(p,p') where P=|2p-p'|, P'=p' and p,p' are coprime, and they
share the central charges of the rational superconformal minimal models
SM(P,P'). Their mathematical description entails the fused planar
Temperley-Lieb algebra which is a spin-1 BMW tangle algebra with loop fugacity
beta_2=x^2+1+x^{-2} and twist omega=x^4 where x=e^{i(p'-p)pi/p'}. Examples are
superconformal dense polymers LSM(2,3) with c=-5/2, beta_2=0 and superconformal
percolation LSM(3,4) with c=0, beta_2=1. We calculate the free energies
analytically. By numerically studying finite-size spectra on the strip with
appropriate boundary conditions in Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond sectors, we argue
that, in the continuum scaling limit, these lattice models are associated with
the logarithmic superconformal models LM(P,P';2). For system size N, we propose
finitized Kac character formulas whose P,P' dependence only enters in the
fractional power of q in a prefactor. These characters involve Motzkin and
Riordan polynomials defined in terms of q-trinomial coefficients. Using the
Hamiltonian limit, we argue that there exist reducible yet indecomposable
representations for which the Virasoro dilatation operator L_0 exhibits rank-2
Jordan blocks confirming that these theories are indeed logarithmic. We relate
these results to the N=1 superconformal representation theory.

structure has been studied using Raman scattering and synchrotron powder x-ray
diffraction up to 20 GPa. From our studies on RCrO3 we found that the
octahedral tilts (distortions) increase with pressure. This is contrary to the
earlier report which suggests that in LaCrO3, the distortions decrease with
pressure leading to a more ordered phase at high pressure. Here we observe that
the rate of increase in distortion decreases with the increase in R-ion radii.
This occurs due to the reduction in the compression of RO12 polyhedra with a
corresponding increase in the compression of the CrO6 octahedra with increasing
R-ion radii. From the Raman studies, we predict a critical R-ion radii, above
which we expect the distortions in RCrO3 to reduce with increasing pressure
leading to what is observed in the case of LaCrO3. These Raman results are
consistent with our pressure dependent structural studies on RCrO3 (R = Gd, Eu,
Sm). Also, our results suggest that the pressure dependence of N\'eel
temperature, TNCr, (where the Cr3+ spin orders) in RCrO3 is mostly affected by
the compressions of Cr-O bonds rather than the alteration of octahedral tilts.

electrically discharging (e.g. by lightning), which significantly infuences the
local chemistry creating conditions similar to those thought responsible for
life in early planetary atmospheres. We note that such lightning discharges
contribute also to the ionisation state of the atmosphere. We apply scaling
laws for electrical discharge processes from laboratory measurements and
numerical experiments to Drift-Phoenix model atmosphere results to model the
discharge's propagation downwards (as lightning) and upwards (as sprites)
through the atmospheric clouds. We evaluate the spatial extent and energetics
of lightning discharges. The atmospheric volume affected (e.g. by increase of
temperature or electron number) is larger in a brown dwarf atmosphere ($10^8

It reflects the ability of WSNs to detect the fields of interest. In a real
sensor networks application, the detection area is always non-ideal and the
terrain of the detection area is often more complex in applications of
three-dimensional sensor networks. Consequently, many of the existing coverage
strategies cannot be directly applied to three-dimensional spaces. This paper
presents a new coverage strategy for the three-dimensional sensor networks.
Sensor nodes are uniformly distributed. The cost factor is utilized to
construct the perceived probability and the classical watershed algorithm after
the transformation of points from the three-dimensional space to the
two-dimensional plane using the dimensionality reduction method, which can
maintain the topology characteristic of the non-linear terrain. The detection
probability in the optimal breath path is used as the measure to evaluate the
coverage. Simulation results indicate that the proposed strategy can determine
the coverage with fewer nodes, while achieving the coverage requirements of the
networks.

the grand-canonical ensembles, associated with rotating black holes in
D-dimensions, are analysed and compared. Such black holes are known to be
thermodynamically unstable, but the instability is a consequence of a subtle
interplay between specific heats and the moments of inertia and it manifests
itself differently in the different ensembles. A simple relation between the
product of the specific heat and the determinant of the moment of inertia in
both the canonical and the grand-canonical ensembles is derived. Myers-Perry
black holes in arbitrary dimension are studied in detail. All temperature
extrema in the micro-canonical ensemble are determined and classified. The
specific heat and the moment of inertia tensor are evaluated in both the
canonical and the grand-canonical ensembles in any dimension. All zeros and
poles of the specific heats, as a function of the angular momenta, are
determined and the eigenvalues of the isentropic moment of inertia tensor are
also found and classified. It is further shown that many of the thermodynamic
properties of a Myers-Perry black hole in D-2 dimensions can be obtained from
those of a black hole in D dimensions by sending one of the angular momenta to

interpretation of scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) data (as this is the
only technique which ostensibly provides direct evidence for the presence of

entirely unfunctionalised particles, we conclusively show that all of the STM
evidence for striped nanoparticles published to date can instead be explained
by a combination of well-known instrumental artefacts, strong observer bias,
and/or improper data acquisition/analysis protocols. We also critically
re-examine the evidence for the presence of ligand stripes which has been
claimed to have been found from transmission electron microscopy, nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopy, small angle neutron scattering experiments,

terms of stripe formation, we show that, just as for the STM measurements,
rather more mundane interpretations can account for the reported results.

studied in many fields such as compressive sensing, signal processing, and
image processing. To solve this kind of ill-posed problems, a regularization
term (i.e., regularizer) should be introduced, under the assumption that the
solutions have some specific properties, such as sparsity and group sparsity.
Widely used regularizers include the $\ell_1$ norm, total variation (TV)
semi-norm, and so on.
  Recently, a new regularization term with overlapping group sparsity has been
considered. Majorization minimization iteration method or variable duplication
methods are often applied to solve them. However, there have been no direct
methods for solve the relevant problems because of the difficulty of
overlapping. In this paper, we proposed new explicit shrinkage formulas for one
class of these relevant problems, whose regularization terms have translation
invariant overlapping groups. Moreover, we apply our results in TV deblurring
and denoising with overlapping group sparsity. We use alternating direction
method of multipliers to iterate solve it. Numerical results also verify the
validity and effectiveness of our new explicit shrinkage formulas.

Flooding is an important query strategy. However, original flooding is prone to
cause heavy network loads. To address this problem, we propose a variant of
flooding, called Level-Based Flooding (LBF). With LBF, the whole network is
divided into several levels according to the distances (i.e., hops) between the
sensor nodes and the sink node. The sink node knows the level information of
each node. Query packets are broadcast in the network according to the levels
of nodes. Upon receiving a query packet, sensor nodes decide how to process it
according to the percentage of neighbors that have processed it. When the
target node receives the query packet, it sends its data back to the sink node
via random walk. We show by extensive simulations that the performance of LBF
in terms of cost and latency is much better than that of original flooding, and
LBF can be used in IoT of different scales.

Then we calculate the distances between reliable beacon nodes and the mobile

bilayer graphene. As electrons are added to the system, excitonic order is
suppressed, and unconventional superconductivity appears generically in its
place. In general it is found that the maximum critical temperature for
superconductivity appears directly adjacent to the dome of particle-hole order,
illustrating the importance of fluctuations in these channels for the formation
of unconventional superconductivity. We obtain the phase diagram showing
characteristic ordering temperatures for both short- and long-ranged
interactions, and show that the most likely superconducting instabilities occur
in $d$-wave, $f$-wave, and pair density wave channels. The nature of and
competition between these phases are further analyzed using both free energy
expansion and self-consistent mean-field theory. The effects of finite
temperature and trigonal warping due to further-neighbor hopping are studied,
and implications for experiments on bilayer graphene are discussed.

paid to developing and making use of mobile applications that require position
information. The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a very popular localization
technique used by these applications because of its high accuracy. However, GPS
incurs an unacceptable energy consumption, which severely limits the use of
smartphones and reduces the battery lifetime. Then an urgent requirement for
these applications is a localization strategy that not only provides enough
accurate position information to meet users' need but also consumes less
energy. In this paper, we present an energy-efficient localization strategy for
smartphone applications. On one hand, it can dynamically estimate the next
localization time point to avoid unnecessary localization operations. On the
other hand, it can also automatically select the energy-optimal localization
method. We evaluate the strategy through a series of simulations. Experimental
results show that it can significantly reduce the localization energy
consumption of smartphones while ensuring a good satisfaction degree.

techniques to deal with ever growing risks associated with security threats is
DREAD model. It is used for rating risk of threats identified in the abuser

such precise distribution is not suitable for risk categorization as risks are
vague in nature and deals with high level of uncertainty. In view of these risk
factors, our paper proposes a novel fuzzy approach using DREAD model for

understand the insights of the data and explore its hidden structure. The
selected instances can also be used for data preprocessing tasks such as
learning a low-dimensional embedding of the data points or computing a low-rank

accurate greedy algorithm for large-scale column subset selection. The
algorithm minimizes an objective function which measures the reconstruction
error of the data matrix based on the subset of selected columns. The paper
first presents a centralized greedy algorithm for column subset selection which
depends on a novel recursive formula for calculating the reconstruction error
of the data matrix. The paper then presents a MapReduce algorithm which selects
a few representative columns from a matrix whose columns are massively
distributed across several commodity machines. The algorithm first learns a
concise representation of all columns using random projection, and it then
solves a generalized column subset selection problem at each machine in which a
subset of columns are selected from the sub-matrix on that machine such that
the reconstruction error of the concise representation is minimized. The paper
demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm through
an empirical evaluation on benchmark data sets.

special addition and multiplication operations were defined. The full pure
state vector (FPSV) \rho, the pure state vector {\rho_f} and the equivalent

{{N_\rho},{H_\rho}} is the representation of R, associated with \rho. The
*-Algebra R has infinitely many non-equivalent irreducible GNS constructions

  It is proved that, the dynamical motions of the QSINP is totally within the

time reversal transformation makes the initial FPSV and its corresponding
dynamical evolution into another non-equivalent GNS construction. Therefore,
within the GNS construction associated with the FPSV, the dynamics of the QSINP

the GNS construction could be treated by the formal scattering theory. The
Master equation with dissipative term was obtained, which is formally
irrelevant of the initial state and the corresponding GNS construction. This

this paper, a study of recent techniques and automated approaches to
attributing authorship of online messages is presented. The focus of this
review study is to summarize all existing authorship identification techniques
used in literature to identify authors of online messages. Also it discusses
evaluation criteria and parameters for authorship attribution studies and list
open questions that will attract future work in this area.

effectively solve proton spin crisis. Within domain of applicability of this
simple model proton consists only of two u quarks and one d quarks (two of
which have spin opposite to proton and one identical to proton) and one neutral
vector phi meson (with spin two times larger than proton spin and directed
identically to proton spin). This model is in full agreement not only with
existing DIS experiments, but also with spin and electric charge conservation
as well as in a satisfactory agreement with rest mass-energy conservation
(since phi meson mass is close to proton rest mass). Our model opens an
interesting possibility of the solution of the quarks and leptons families
problem (proton is not an absolutely non-strange particle, but only a particle
with almost totally effectively hidden strange). Also we suggest a possible
""first step"" toward the solution of the supersymmetry crisis using so-called
superexclusion principle. According to this principle usual particles
(electron, neutrino,...) can exist actually and virtually, while their
supersymmetric partners, s-particles (selectron, neutralino, ...) can exist
(super)exclusively virtually but not actually.

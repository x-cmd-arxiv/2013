considerably, without changing the antiferromagnetic bond probability p, by

hypercubic lattices and hierarchical lattices. Such overfrustrated and
underfrustrated Ising systems on hierarchical lattices in d=3 and 2 are
studied. With the removal of just 51 % of frustration, a spin-glass phase
occurs in d=2. With the addition of just 33 % frustration, the spin-glass phase
disappears in d=3. Sequences of 18 different phase diagrams for different
levels of frustration are calculated in both dimensions. In general,
frustration lowers the spin-glass ordering temperature. At low temperatures,
increased frustration favors the spin-glass phase (before it disappears) over
the ferromagnetic phase and symmetrically the antiferromagnetic phase. When any
amount, including infinitesimal, frustration is introduced, the chaotic
rescaling of local interactions occurs in the spin-glass phase. Chaos increases
with increasing frustration, as seen from the increased positive value of the
calculated Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$, starting from $\lambda =0$ when
frustration is absent. The calculated runaway exponent $y_R$ of the
renormalization-group flows decreases with increasing frustration to $y_R=0$
when the spin-glass phase disappears. From our calculations of entropy and
specific heat curves in d=3, it is seen that frustration lowers in temperature
the onset of both long- and short-range order in spin-glass phases, but is more
effective on the former. From calculations of the entropy as a function of
antiferromagnetic bond concentration p, it is seen that the ground-state and
low-temperature entropy already mostly sets in within the ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic phases, before the spin-glass phase is reached.

grow large. The sensing matrix is considered to be from a class of random
ensembles that encloses as special cases standard Gaussian, row-orthogonal,
geometric and so-called T-orthogonal constructions. Source vectors that have
non-uniform sparsity are included in the system model. Regularization based on
l1-norm and leading to LASSO estimation, or basis pursuit denoising, is given
the main emphasis in the analysis. Extensions to l2-norm and ""zero-norm""
regularization are also briefly discussed. The analysis is carried out using
the replica method in conjunction with some novel matrix integration results.
Numerical experiments for LASSO are provided to verify the accuracy of the
analytical results. The numerical experiments show that for noisy compressed
sensing, the standard Gaussian ensemble is a suboptimal choice for the
measurement matrix. Orthogonal constructions provide a superior performance in
all considered scenarios and are easier to implement in practical applications.
It is also discovered that for non-uniform sparsity patterns the T-orthogonal
matrices can further improve the mean square error behavior of the
reconstruction when the noise level is not too high. However, as the additive
noise becomes more prominent in the system, the simple row-orthogonal
measurement matrix appears to be the best choice out of the considered
ensembles.

discovery of the long-awaited Higgs boson. The standard cosmological model has
met the challenge of the high precision observations in cosmology and
astroparticle physics. However these two standard models face both several
theoretical issues, such as the naturalness problem in the Higgs sector of the
Standard Model, as well as observational issues, in particular the fact that an
unknown kind of matter called Dark Matter accounts for the majority of the
matter content in our Universe. Attempts to solve such problems have led to the
development of New Physics models during the last decades. Supersymmetry is one
such model which addresses the fine-tuning problem in the Higgs sector and
provides viable Dark Matter candidates. Current high energy and high precision
experiments give many new opportunities to probe the supersymmetric models. It
is in this context that this thesis is written. Considering the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), the simplest supersymmetric extension of
the Standard Model of particle physics, and its conventional Dark Matter
candidate, the neutralino, it is shown that collider constraints could provide
informations on the very early Universe at the inflation area. It is also
demonstrated that the Indirect Detection of Dark Matter, despite several
drawbacks, can be a powerful technique to probe supersymmetric Dark Matter
models. Beyond the MSSM it is shown that unique characteristics of the Dark
Matter candidate in the NMSSM could be probed at colliders. The study of a
supersymmetric model with an extended gauge symmetry, the UMSSM, is also
developed. The features of another Dark Matter candidate of this model, the
Right-Handed sneutrino, are analysed. More general constraints such as those
coming from low energy observables are finally considered in this model.

variational approach is used to derive a model for a piezoelectric beam that
includes magnetic effects. It is proven that the partial differential equation
model is well-posed. Magnetic effects have a strong effect on the
stabilizability of the control system. For almost all system parameters the
piezoelectric beam can be strongly stabilized, but is not exponentially
stabilizable in the energy space. Strong stabilization is achieved using only
electrical feedback. Furthermore, using the same electrical feedback, an

  Mellon University, PA, and Instituto Superior T\'ecnico, Lisbon, Portugal",,,,"math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","  This thesis is concerned with the design of distributed algorithms for
solving optimization problems. We consider networks where each node has
exclusive access to a cost function, and design algorithms that make all nodes
cooperate to find the minimum of the sum of all the cost functions. Several
problems in signal processing, control, and machine learning can be posed as
such optimization problems. Given that communication is often the most
energy-consuming operation in networks, it is important to design
communication-efficient algorithms. The main contributions of this thesis are a
classification scheme for distributed optimization and a set of corresponding
communication-efficient algorithms.
  The class of optimization problems we consider is quite general, since each
function may depend on arbitrary components of the optimization variable, and
not necessarily on all of them. In doing so, we go beyond the common assumption
in distributed optimization and create additional structure that can be used to
reduce the number of communications. This structure is captured by our
classification scheme, which identifies easier instances of the problem, for
example the standard distributed optimization problem, where all functions
depend on all the components of the variable.
  In our algorithms, no central node coordinates the network, all the
communications occur between neighboring nodes, and the data associated with
each node is processed locally. We show several applications including average
consensus, support vector machines, network flows, and several distributed
scenarios for compressed sensing. We also propose a new framework for
distributed model predictive control. Through extensive numerical experiments,
we show that our algorithms outperform prior distributed algorithms in terms of
communication-efficiency, even some that were specifically designed for a
particular application.

throughput metabolomics. One of the key obstacles to the effective use of this
technology is the difficulty in interpreting measured spectra to accurately and
efficiently identify metabolites. Traditional methods for automated metabolite
identification compare the target MS or MS/MS spectrum to the spectra in a
reference database, ranking candidates based on the closeness of the match.
However the limited coverage of available databases has led to an interest in
computational methods for predicting reference MS/MS spectra from chemical
structures.
  This work proposes a probabilistic generative model for the MS/MS
fragmentation process, which we call Competitive Fragmentation Modeling (CFM),
and a machine learning approach for learning parameters for this model from
MS/MS data. We show that CFM can be used in both a MS/MS spectrum prediction
task (ie, predicting the mass spectrum from a chemical structure), and in a
putative metabolite identification task (ranking possible structures for a
target MS/MS spectrum).
  In the MS/MS spectrum prediction task, CFM shows significantly improved
performance when compared to a full enumeration of all peaks corresponding to
substructures of the molecule. In the metabolite identification task, CFM
obtains substantially better rankings for the correct candidate than existing
methods (MetFrag and FingerID) on tripeptide and metabolite data, when querying
PubChem or KEGG for candidate structures of similar mass.

We provide a numerical algorithm allowing one to seek for maximal violation of

non-thermal electrons in the coronal part of a flaring loop can exceed the
number of electrons required to explain the hard X-ray-emitting footpoints of
the same flaring loop. Such sources cannot, therefore, be interpreted on the
basis of the standard collisional transport model, in which electrons stream
along the loop while losing their energy through collisions with the ambient
plasma; additional physical processes, to either trap or scatter the energetic
electrons, are required. Motivated by this and other observations that suggest
that high energy electrons are confined to the coronal region of the source, we
consider turbulent pitch angle scattering of fast electrons off low frequency
magnetic fluctuations as a confinement mechanism, modeled as a spatial
diffusion parallel to the mean magnetic field. In general, turbulent scattering
leads to a reduction of the collisional stopping distance of non-thermal
electrons along the loop and hence to an enhancement of the coronal HXR source
relative to the footpoints. The variation of source size $L$ with electron
energy $E$ becomes weaker than the quadratic behavior pertinent to collisional
transport, with the slope of $L(E)$ depending directly on the mean free path
$\lambda$ again pitch angle scattering. Comparing the predictions of the model
with observations, we find that $\lambda \sim$$(10^8-10^9)$ cm for $\sim30$
keV, less than the length of a typical flaring loop and smaller than, or
comparable to, the size of the electron acceleration region.

earlier using an analytic definition, but so far, a good working definition in
the same spirit is not available in the setting of general sub-Riemannian
manifolds. In the present paper we adopt therefore a metric rather than
analytic viewpoint.
  As a first main result, we prove that the sub-Riemannian lens space admits
nontrivial uniformly quasiregular (UQR) mappings, that is, quasiregular
mappings with a uniform bound on the distortion of all the iterates. In doing
so, we also obtain new examples of UQR maps on the standard sub-Riemannian
spheres. The proof is based on a method for building conformal traps on
sub-Riemannian spheres using quasiconformal flows, and an adaptation of this
approach to quotients of spheres.
  One may then study the quasiregular semigroup generated by a UQR mapping. In
the second part of the paper we follow Tukia to prove the existence of a
measurable conformal structure which is invariant under such a semigroup. Here,
the conformal structure is specified only on the horizontal distribution, and
the pullback is defined using the Margulis--Mostow derivative (which
generalizes the classical and Pansu derivatives).

more polarised on average than CRL 618 with a mean fractional polarisation of

silicate dust shows higher polarisation than carbonaceous dust. In both
objects, an anti-correlation between the fractional polarisation and the

field, rather the field is generally well aligned and organised along the polar
direction. This is clearly seen in CRL 618 while in the case of OH 231.8+4.2,
the geometry indicates an X-shaped structure coinciding overall with a
dipole/polar configuration. However in the later case, the presence of a
fragmented and weak toroidal field should not be discarded. Finally, in both

major axis of the 12CO outflow. This alignment could indicate the presence of a
magnetic outflow launching mechanism. Based on our new high resolution data we

interaction cross-section of dark matter with ordinary matter. We investigate
how robust limits are against astro-physical uncertainties. We study the effect
of the velocity distribution of dark matter in our Galaxy on capture rates in
the Sun. We investigate four sources of uncertainties: orbital speed of the
Sun, escape velocity of dark matter from the halo, dark matter velocity
distribution functions and existence of a dark disc. We find that even extreme
cases currently discussed do not decrease the sensitivity of indirect detection
significantly because the capture is achieved over a broad range of the
velocity distribution by integration over the velocity distribution. The effect
of the uncertainty in the high-velocity tail of dark matter halo is very
marginal as the capture process is rather inefficient at this region. The
difference in capture rate in the Sun for various scenarios is compared to the
expected change in event rates for direct detection. The possibility of
co-rotating structure with the Sun can largely boost the signal and hence makes
the interpretation of indirect detection conservative compared to direct
detection.

large-scale cosmological N-body simulations to study statistical properties of

distribution of the local Hubble parameter depends not only on the scale of
inhomogeneities, but also on how one defines the positions of observers in the
cosmic web and what reference frame is used. Observers located in random dark
matter haloes measure on average lower expansion rates than those at random
positions in space or in the centres of cosmic voids, and this effect is
stronger from the halo rest frames compared to the CMB rest frame. We compare
the predictions for the local Hubble parameter with observational constraints
based on type Ia supernovae (SNIa) and CMB observations. Due to cosmic
variance, for observers located in random haloes we show that the Hubble
constant determined from nearby SNIa may differ from that measured from the CMB
by 0.8 per cent at 1sigma statistical significance. This scatter is too small
to significantly alleviate a recently claimed discrepancy between current
measurements assuming a flat LCDM model. However, for observers located in the
centres of the largest voids permitted by the standard LCDM model, we find that
Hubble constant measurements from SNIa would be biased high by 5 per cent,

object in a few examples, we look into the compatibility of the stress tensors
corresponding to different formulae of the EM force density with special
relativity. Ampere-Lorentz's formula of the EM force density is physically
justifiable in that the electric field and the magnetic flux density act on the
densities of the total charges and the total currents, unlike Minkowski's
formula which completely excludes the densities of the bounded charges and the
bounded currents inside homogeneous media. Abraham's formula is fanciful and
devoid of physical meaning. Einstein-Laub's formula seems to include the
densities of the total charges and the total currents at first sight, but
grouping the bounded charges and the bounded currents into point-like dipoles
erroneously results in the hidden momentum being omitted, hence the error in
[Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 193901 (2012)]. Naturally, the Ampere-Lorentz stress
tensor accords with special relativity. The Minkowski stress tensor is also
consistent with special relativity. It is worth noting that the mathematical
expression of the Minkowski stress tensor can be quite different from the
well-known form of this stress tensor in the literature. We show that the
Einstein-Laub stress tensor is incompatible with special relativity, and
therefore we rebut the Einstein-Laub force density. Since the Abraham momentum
density of the EM fields is inherently corresponding to the Einstein-Laub force
density [Phys. Rev. Lett 111, 043602 (2013)], our rebuttal may also shed light
on the controversy over the momentum of light.

often employed as a measure of the star formation rate in external galaxies.
Under most conditions, the emission from the single [CII] line is proportional
to the collisional excitation rate coefficient. We here used improved
calculations of the deexcitation rate of [CII] by collisions with H$_2$ to
calculate more accurate expressions for interstellar C$^+$ fine structure
emission, its critical density, and its cooling rate. The collision rates in
the new quantum calculation are $\sim$ 25% larger than those previously

a proliferation of distributed object stores that offer high availability,
reliability and enhanced performance for MapReduce-style workloads. However,
relational workloads cannot always be evaluated efficiently using MapReduce
without extensive data migrations, which cause network congestion and reduced
query throughput. We study the problem of computing data placement strategies
that minimize the data communication costs incurred by typical relational query
workloads in a distributed setting.
  Our main contribution is a reduction of the data placement problem to the
well-studied problem of {\sc Graph Partitioning}, which is NP-Hard but for
which efficient approximation algorithms exist. The novelty and significance of
this result lie in representing the communication cost exactly and using
standard graphs instead of hypergraphs, which were used in prior work on data
placement that optimized for different objectives (not communication cost).
  We study several practical extensions of the problem: with load balancing,
with replication, with materialized views, and with complex query plans
consisting of sequences of intermediate operations that may be computed on
different servers. We provide integer linear programs (IPs) that may be used
with any IP solver to find an optimal data placement. For the no-replication
case, we use publicly available graph partitioning libraries (e.g., METIS) to
efficiently compute nearly-optimal solutions. For the versions with
replication, we introduce two heuristics that utilize the {\sc Graph
Partitioning} solution of the no-replication case. Using the TPC-DS workload,
it may take an IP solver weeks to compute an optimal data placement, whereas
our reduction produces nearly-optimal solutions in seconds.

modelling partially observable systems. By compactly representing systems as
functions of observable quantities, the PSR learning approach avoids using
local-minima prone expectation-maximization and instead employs a globally
optimal moment-based algorithm. Moreover, since PSRs do not require a
predetermined latent state structure as an input, they offer an attractive
framework for model-based reinforcement learning when agents must plan without
a priori access to a system model. Unfortunately, the expressiveness of PSRs
comes with significant computational cost, and this cost is a major factor
inhibiting the use of PSRs in applications. In order to alleviate this
shortcoming, we introduce the notion of compressed PSRs (CPSRs). The CPSR
learning approach combines recent advancements in dimensionality reduction,
incremental matrix decomposition, and compressed sensing. We show how this
approach provides a principled avenue for learning accurate approximations of
PSRs, drastically reducing the computational costs associated with learning
while also providing effective regularization. Going further, we propose a
planning framework which exploits these learned models. And we show that this
approach facilitates model-learning and planning in large complex partially

of a stationary point process $\Phi$ to some point of $\Phi$. It is fully
determined by its associated point-map, $f$, which gives the image of the
origin by $F$. It was proved by J. Mecke that if $F$ is bijective, then the
Palm probability of $\Phi$ is left invariant by the translation of $-f$. The
initial question motivating this paper is the following generalization of this
invariance result: in the non-bijective case, what probability measures on the
set of counting measures are left invariant by the translation of $-f$? The
point-map probabilities of $\Phi$ are defined from the action of the semigroup
of point-map translations on the space of Palm probabilities, and more
precisely from the compactification of the orbits of this semigroup action. If
the point-map probability exists, is uniquely defined, and if it satisfies
certain continuity properties, it then provides a solution to this invariant
measure problem. Point-map probabilities are objects of independent interest.
They are shown to be a strict generalization of Palm probabilities: when $F$ is
bijective, the point-map probability of $\Phi$ boils down to the Palm
probability of $\Phi$. When it is not bijective, there exist cases where the
point-map probability of $\Phi$ is singular with respect to its Palm
probability. A tightness based criterion for the existence of the point-map
probabilities of a stationary point process is given. An interpretation of the
point-map probability as the conditional law of the point process given that
the origin has $F$-pre-images of all orders is also provided. The results are
illustrated by a few examples.

fireball leads to harmonic flow reflecting the deformation of the initial

graph G is Ramsey for H if and only if it is Ramsey for H'. In this paper, we
study the problem of determining which graphs are Ramsey-equivalent to the
complete graph K_k. A famous theorem of Nesetril and Rodl implies that any
graph H which is Ramsey-equivalent to K_k must contain K_k. We prove that the
only connected graph which is Ramsey-equivalent to K_k is itself. This gives a
negative answer to the question of Szabo, Zumstein, and Zurcher on whether K_k
is Ramsey-equivalent to K_k.K_2, the graph on k+1 vertices consisting of K_k
with a pendent edge.
  In fact, we prove a stronger result. A graph G is Ramsey minimal for a graph
H if it is Ramsey for H but no proper subgraph of G is Ramsey for H. Let s(H)
be the smallest minimum degree over all Ramsey minimal graphs for H. The study
of s(H) was introduced by Burr, Erdos, and Lovasz, where they show that
s(K_k)=(k-1)^2. We prove that s(K_k.K_2)=k-1, and hence K_k and K_k.K_2 are not
Ramsey-equivalent.
  We also address the question of which non-connected graphs are
Ramsey-equivalent to K_k. Let f(k,t) be the maximum f such that the graph
H=K_k+fK_t, consisting of K_k and f disjoint copies of K_t, is
Ramsey-equivalent to K_k. Szabo, Zumstein, and Zurcher gave a lower bound on
f(k,t). We prove an upper bound on f(k,t) which is roughly within a factor 2 of
the lower bound.

which can be computed without reference to an external jet algorithm, and the
fixed-order region where an explicit jet algorithm must be specified. Our code,
used for generating the numerical results, is flexible enough to incorporate
different jet algorithms for the fixed-order calculation. We also perform a jet
shape analysis, defined within the 1-jettiness framework, which allows one to
control the amount of radiation included in the definition of the final state
jet. This formalism can allow for detailed studies of jet energy-loss
mechanisms and nuclear medium effects. The analysis presented here can be used

demonstrate the equivalence of a Bayesian hypothesis test using a Bayes factor
and the corresponding classical test, for a large class of models, which are
detailed in the paper. In particular, we show that the role of the prior and
critical region for the Bayes factor test is only to specify the type I error.
This is their only role since, as we show, the power function of the Bayes
factor test coincides exactly with that of the classical test, once the type I
error has been fixed.
  For more complex tests involving nuisance parameters, we recover the
classical test by using Jeffreys prior on the nuisance parameters, while the
prior on the hypothesized parameters can be arbitrary up to a large class. On
the other hand, we show that using proper priors on the nuisance parameters
results in a test with uniformly lower power than the classical test.

routine method of testing the convergence of N-body simulations (in particular,
the negligibility of two-body scattering effect) is to find the conditions
under which the shape of the formed structures is insensitive to numerical
parameters. The results obtained with this approach suggest a surprisingly
minor role of the particle collisions: the central density profile remains
untouched and close to NFW, even if the simulation time significantly exceeds
the collisional relaxation time $\tau_r$. We analyze the test body distribution
in the halo center with help of the Fokker-Planck equation. It turns out that
the Fokker-Planck diffusion transforms any reasonable initial distribution into
NFW-like profile $\rho\propto r^{-1}$ in a time shorter than $\tau_r$. On the
contrary, profile $\rho\propto r^{-1}$ should survive much longer, being a sort
of attractor: the Fokker-Planck diffusion is self-compensated in this case.
Thus the test body scattering may create a stable NFW-like pseudosolution that
can be mixed up with the real convergence. This fact might help to eliminate
the well-known 'cusp vs. core' problem.

spatial and velocity structure similar to that of vibrationally-excited SiO

methods focusing on social network structure analysis and empirical data
mining. However, the dynamics of information diffusion, which are heavily
influenced by network users' decisions, actions and their socio-economic
interactions, is generally ignored by most of existing works. In this paper, we
propose an evolutionary game theoretic framework to model the dynamic
information diffusion process in social networks. Specifically, we derive the
information diffusion dynamics in complete networks, uniform degree and

particle into a pair of electron and positron is analyzed. Two spin operators

differentiates the spin angular momentum and the magnetic moment. The use of
weak interaction that can measure helicity is suggested in the analysis of

played by redundancy in identifying the small subset of quantum states with
resilience characteristic of objective classical reality, we explore the
implications of redundant records for consistent histories. The consistent
histories formalism is a tool for describing sequences of events taking place
in an evolving closed quantum system. A set of histories is consistent when one
can reason about them using Boolean logic, i.e., when probabilities of
sequences of events that define histories are additive. However, the vast
majority of the sets of histories that are merely consistent are flagrantly
non-classical in other respects. This embarras de richesses (known as the set
selection problem) suggests that one must go beyond consistency to identify how
the classical past arises in our quantum Universe. The key intuition we follow
is that the records of events that define the familiar objective past are
inscribed in many distinct systems, e.g., subsystems of the environment, and
are accessible locally in space and time to observers. We identify histories
that are not just consistent but redundantly consistent using the partial-trace
condition introduced by Finkelstein as a bridge between histories and
decoherence. The existence of redundant records is a sufficient condition for
redundant consistency. It selects, from the multitude of the alternative sets
of consistent histories, a small subset endowed with redundant records
characteristic of the objective classical past. The information about an
objective history of the past is then simultaneously within reach of many, who
can independently reconstruct it and arrive at compatible conclusions in the
present.

expensive to acquire. On the other hand, observational data of the organism in
steady state (e.g. wild-type) are more readily available, but their
informational content is inadequate for the task at hand. We develop a
computational approach to appropriately utilize both data sources for
estimating a regulatory network. The proposed approach is based on a three-step
algorithm to estimate the underlying directed but cyclic network, that uses as
input both perturbation screens and steady state gene expression data. In the
first step, the algorithm determines causal orderings of the genes that are
consistent with the perturbation data, by combining an exhaustive search method
with a fast heuristic that in turn couples a Monte Carlo technique with a fast
search algorithm. In the second step, for each obtained causal ordering, a
regulatory network is estimated using a penalized likelihood based method,
while in the third step a consensus network is constructed from the highest
scored ones. Extensive computational experiments show that the algorithm
performs well in reconstructing the underlying network and clearly outperforms
competing approaches that rely only on a single data source. Further, it is
established that the algorithm produces a consistent estimate of the regulatory

radiating at sub-maximal (sub-Eddington) rates, as in Galactic black-hole X-ray
binaries but with larger, cooler accretion disks. Alternatively, they could be
stellar-mass black holes radiating at Eddington or super-Eddington rates. On
its discovery, M101 ULX-1 had a luminosity of $3\times10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and
a supersoft thermal disk spectrum with an exceptionally low temperature --
uncomplicated by photons energized by a corona of hot electrons -- more
consistent with the expected appearance of an accreting intermediate-mass black
hole. Here we report optical spectroscopic monitoring of M101 ULX-1. We confirm
the previous suggestion that the system contains a Wolf-Rayet star, and reveal
that the orbital period is 8.2 days. The black hole has a minimum mass of
$5M_\odot$, and more probably a mass of $20-30M_\odot$, but we argue that it is
very unlikely to be an intermediate-mass black hole. Therefore its
exceptionally soft spectra at high Eddinton ratios violate the expectations for
accretion onto stellar-mass black holes. Accretion must occur from captured
stellar wind, which has hitherto been thought to be so inefficient that it

some $p\in (0,1)$ and $\int_{B_1(0)} |Du|^2 dz\leq 1$. There exists constant
$M>1$ such that if $$ \int_{B_1(0)} |S(Du)-S(Dv)|^2 dz=\epsilon $$ then $$
\int_{B_{\frac{1}{2}}(0)} |Dv-R Du| dz\leq c
C_p^{\frac{1}{p}}\epsilon^{\frac{p^3}{M Q^5\log(10 C_p Q)}}\text{ for some
}R\in SO(2). $$
  Taking $u=Id$ we obtain a special case of the quantitative rigidity result of
Friesecke, James and Muller. Our main result can be considered as a first step
in a new line of generalization of F-J-M Theorem in which $Id$ is replaced by a
mapping of non-trivial degree.

  Reflecting Universe","76 Pages, 61 figures",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  What is the average density of a black hole, assuming its spin can prevent it
from collapsing into a singularity? For stellar black holes, the average
density is incredibly dense and has over a trillion G force and tidal force
that will rip almost anything apart at the black hole boundary.
  Surprisingly, the average density decreases dramatically for massive black
holes. A black hole of 387 million solar masses would have the average density
of water and would be comparable to a giant water balloon extending from the
sun almost to Jupiter. A black hole of 11 billion solar masses would have the
average density of air and would be analogous to a giant air filled party
balloon extending 2.5 times farther out than Pluto. The average mass density in
space itself, however small, eventually can become a low density black hole. If
the average density of the universe matches the critical density of just 5.67
hydrogen atoms per cubic meter, it would form a Schwarzschild low density black
hole of approximately 13.8 billion light years, matching the big bang model of
the universe.
  A black hole can use rotation and/or charge to keep from collapsing. The G
and tidal forces become negligible for large low density black holes. Thus one
can be living in a large low density black hole and not know it. Further
analysis about the critical density rules out an expanding universe and
disproves the big bang theory. Higher densities could produce a much smaller
reflecting universe.

the dynamics of biological populations. However, these methods have typically
been evaluated using different population dynamics models and in the context of
very different concepts of stability, which makes it difficult to compare their
relative efficiencies. Moreover, since the dynamics of populations are
dependent on the life-history of the species and its environment, it is
conceivable that the stabilizing effects of control methods would also be
affected by such factors, a complication that has typically not been
investigated. In this study we compare six different control methods with
respect to their efficiency at inducing a common level of enhancement (50%
increase) for two kinds of stability (constancy and persistence) under four
different life history/ environment combinations. Since these methods have been
analytically studied elsewhere, we focus on an intuitive understanding of
realistic simulations incorporating noise, extinction probability and lattice
effect. We show that for these six methods, even when the magnitude of
stabilization attained is the same, other aspects of the dynamics like
population size distribution can be very different. Consequently, correlated
aspects of stability, like the amount of persistence for a given degree of
constancy stability (and vice versa) or the corresponding effective population
size (a measure of resistance to genetic drift) vary widely among the methods.
Moreover, the number of organisms needed to be added or removed to attain
similar levels of stabilization also varies for these methods, a fact that has
economic implications. Finally, we compare the relative efficiency of these
methods through a composite index of various stability related measures. We
find that restocking to a constant lower threshold seems to be the optimal
method under most conditions.

boolean formulas vs. circuits. Specifically, we consider the problem Distance
$k(n)$ Connectivity, which asks whether two specified nodes in a graph of size
$n$ are connected by a path of length at most $k(n)$. This problem is solvable
(by the recursive doubling technique) on {\bf circuits} of depth $O(\log k)$
and size $O(kn^3)$. In contrast, we show that solving this problem on {\bf
formulas} of depth $\log n/(\log\log n)^{O(1)}$ requires size $n^{\Omega(\log
k)}$ for all $k(n) \leq \log\log n$. As corollaries:
  (i) It follows that polynomial-size circuits for Distance $k(n)$ Connectivity
require depth $\Omega(\log k)$ for all $k(n) \leq \log\log n$. This matches the
upper bound from recursive doubling and improves a previous $\Omega(\log\log
k)$ lower bound of Beame, Pitassi and Impagliazzo [BIP98].
  (ii) We get a tight lower bound of $s^{\Omega(d)}$ on the size required to
simulate size-$s$ depth-$d$ circuits by depth-$d$ formulas for all $s(n) =
n^{O(1)}$ and $d(n) \leq \log\log\log n$. No lower bound better than
$s^{\Omega(1)}$ was previously known for any $d(n) \nleq O(1)$.
  Our proof technique is centered on a new notion of pathset complexity, which
roughly speaking measures the minimum cost of constructing a set of (partial)
paths in a universe of size $n$ via the operations of union and relational
join, subject to certain density constraints. Half of our proof shows that
bounded-depth formulas solving Distance $k(n)$ Connectivity imply upper bounds
on pathset complexity. The other half is a combinatorial lower bound on pathset
complexity.

Numerical simulations, however, have found the spatial distributions of halos
to depend not only on their mass but also on the details of their assembly

incorporating this ""assembly bias"" into the excursion set model. Our
derivations are based on modifications of the path integral approach of
Maggiore & Riotto (2010) that models halo formation as a non-Markovian random
walk process. The perturbed density field is assumed to evolve stochastically
with the smoothing scale and exhibits correlated walks in the presence of a
density barrier. We write down conditional probabilities for multiple barrier
crossings, and derive from them analytic expressions for descendant and
progenitor halo mass functions and halo merger rates as a function of both halo
mass and the linear overdensity of the larger-scale environment of the halo.
Our results predict a higher halo merger rate and higher progenitor halo mass
function in regions of higher overdensity, consistent with the behavior seen in

  Networks with CSI Uncertainty",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Transmit optimization and resource allocation for wireless cooperative
networks with channel state information (CSI) uncertainty are important but
challenging problems in terms of both the uncertainty modeling and performance
op- timization. In this paper, we establish a generic stochastic coordinated
beamforming (SCB) framework that provides flex- ibility in the channel
uncertainty modeling, while guaranteeing optimality in the transmission
strategies. We adopt a general stochastic model for the CSI uncertainty, which
is applicable for various practical scenarios. The SCB problem turns out to be
a joint chance constrained program (JCCP) and is known to be highly
intractable. In contrast to all the previous algo- rithms for JCCP that can
only find feasible but sub-optimal solutions, we propose a novel stochastic DC
(difference-of-convex) programming algorithm with optimality guarantee, which
can serve as the benchmark for evaluating heuristic and sub-optimal algorithms.
The key observation is that the highly intractable probability constraint can
be equivalently reformulated as a DC constraint. This further enables efficient
algorithms to achieve optimality. Simulation results will illustrate the
convergence, conservativeness, stability and performance gains of the proposed
algorithm.

universe, we investigate ""genuine irregular galaxies (GIGs)"" in the nearby
universe. Here, GIGs are defined as isolated galaxies without regular
structures (spheroid, bulge, disk, bar, spiral arm, and nucleus). Using the
results of two excellent studies on galaxy morphology based on the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we obtain a sample of 66 irregular galaxies. We
carry out new classification of them into GIGs and non-GIGs which have regular
structure or show evidence for galaxy interaction, by using the SDSS Data
Release 10 images. We then find that a half of these irregular galaxies (33/66)
are GIGs and obtain an unambiguous sample of 33 GIGs for the first time. We
discuss their observational properties by comparing them with those of
elliptical, S0, spiral galaxies, and irregular galaxies without the GIGs. We
find that our GIGs have smaller sizes, lower optical luminosities, bluer
rest-frame optical colors, lower surface stellar mass densities, and lower gas
metallicity than normal galaxies. All these properties suggest that they are in
chemically and dynamically younger phases even in the nearby universe.

performing the $\chi^2$ fits, we find that two DM components are already enough
to give a reasonable fit of both AMS-02 and Fermi-LAT data. The best-fitted
results show that the heavier DM component with its mass 1.5 TeV dominantly
decays through the $\mu$-channel, while the lighter one of 100 GeV mainly
through the $\tau$-channel. As a byproduct, the fine structure around 100 GeV
observed by AMS-02 and Fermi-LAT can be naturally explained by the dropping due
to the lighter DM component. With the obtained model parameters by the fitting,
we calculate the diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission spectrum in this two-component
DM scenario, and find that it is consistent with the data measured by
Fermi-LAT. We also construct a microscopic particle DM model to naturally
realize the two-component DM scenario, and point out an interesting neutrino

Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations are solved for square lattices with up to

fully the nanoscale spatial fluctuations of the superconducting order

the extended ones by the lattice-size scaling of the generalized inverse
participation ratio. It is shown that Anderson localization can not entirely
inhibit the occurrence of the local superconductivity in strongly-disordered
$d$-wave superconductors. Separated by an insulating 'sea' completely, a few
isolated superconducting 'islands' with significant enhancement of the local
superconducting order parameters can survive across the SIT. The
disorder-driven SIT, therefore, is a transition from a $d$-wave superconductor
to a Bose insulator which consists of localized Cooper pairs. Unlike an
$s$-wave superconductor which presents a robust single-particle gap across the
SIT, the optical conductivity of a $d$-wave superconductor reveals a gapless
insulating phase, where the SIT can be detected by observing the disappearance
of the Drude weight with the increasing disorder.

We study the perturbative behaviour of this black hole solution in the

that this black hole is stable in the dRGT theory as far as the spacetime

that the general solution to the perturbation equations contain a single

observed correlation differs significantly from that of GOES-derived

high emission measures, electron densities, and instantaneous thermal energies
suggests that super-hot plasmas are physically distinct from cooler, ~10-20 MK

strong coronal magnetic fields, exceeding ~100 G, and that both the plasma

set R of k regions, find a shortest tour that visits at least one point from
each region. We study the special cases of disjoint, connected, alpha-fat
regions (i.e., every region P contains a disk of diameter diam(P)/alpha) and
disjoint unit disks.
  For the latter, Dumitrescu and Mitchell proposed an algorithm based on
Mitchell's guillotine subdivision approach for the Euclidean TSP and claimed it
to be a PTAS. However, their proof contains a severe gap, which we will close
in the following. Bodlaender et al. remark that their techniques for the
minimum corridor connection problem carry over to the TSPN and yield an
alternative PTAS for this problem.
  For disjoint connected alpha-fat regions of varying size, Mitchell proposed a
slightly different PTAS candidate. We will expose several further problems and
gaps in this approach. Some of them we can close, but overall, for alpha-fat
regions, the existence of a PTAS for the TSPN remains open.

condition holds and the tests correctly reject the null hypotheses. Simulation
studies show that the CLRTs are valid and perform well even when the sample

probe the local spin angular momentum (indirectly, via intra-atomic exchange

restricted in previous works to $0<y < \pi/n$ because Ruijsenaars' original
compactification relies on an equivalent condition. It is found that allowing
generic $0<y<\pi/2$ results in the appearance of new self-dual compact forms,
of two qualitatively different types depending on the value of $y$. The type
(i) cases are similar to the standard case in that the reduced phase space
comes equipped with globally smooth action and position variables, and turns
out to be symplectomorphic to ${\mathbb{C}P^{n-1}}$ as a Hamiltonian toric
manifold. In the type (ii) cases both the position variables and the action

classification is derived for the parameter $y$ according to the type (i)

  and Distributed Antennas",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A great deal of efforts have been made on the performance evaluation of
distributed antenna systems (DASs). Most of them assume a regular base-station
(BS) antenna layout where the number of BS antennas is usually small. With the
growing interest in cellular systems with large antenna arrays at BSs, it
becomes increasingly important for us to study how the BS antenna layout
affects the rate performance when a massive number of BS antennas are employed.
  This paper presents a comparative study of the asymptotic rate performance of
downlink multi-user systems with multiple BS antennas either co-located or
uniformly distributed within a circular cell. Two representative linear
precoding schemes, maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and zero-forcing
beamforming (ZFBF), are considered, with which the effect of BS antenna layout
on the rate performance is characterized. The analysis shows that as the number
of BS antennas $L$ and the number of users $K$ grow infinitely while
$L/K{\rightarrow}\upsilon$, the asymptotic average user rates with the
co-located antenna (CA) layout for both MRT and ZFBF are logarithmic functions
of the ratio $\upsilon$. With the distributed antenna (DA) layout, in contrast,
the scaling behavior of the average user rate closely depends on the precoding
schemes. With ZFBF, for instance, the average user rate grows unboundedly as
$L, K{\rightarrow} \infty$ and $L/K{\rightarrow}\upsilon{>}1$, which indicates
that substantial rate gains over the CA layout can be achieved when the number
of BS antennas $L$ is large. The gain, nevertheless, becomes marginal when MRT
is adopted.

(2013)]. The energy expression recovered through second order is linear in the
parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ that control the Coulomb attenuation. The
method has been tested within the local density approximation on a small test
set consisting of rare-gas and alkaline-earth-metal dimers as well as diatomics
with single, double and triple bonds. In this context, the semi-empirical
$\alpha=0.19$ and $\beta=0.46$ parameters, that were optimized for the hybrid
CAM-B3LYP functional, do not provide accurate interaction and total energies.
Using semi-local functionals with density scaling, that was neglected in this
work, may lead to different conclusions. Calibration studies on a larger test
set would be necessary at this point. This is left for future work. Finally, we
propose as a perspective an alternative CAM-DH approach that relies on the
perturbation expansion of a partially long-range interacting wavefunction. In
this case the energy is not linear anymore in $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Work is in
progress in this direction.

magnetization measurements. The resistivity under magnetic field ({\rho}TH)
measurements showed clearly both the intra-grain and inter-grain transitions,
which are supplemented by detailed (varying frequency and amplitude) ac

detailed heat capacity (CP) studies. Cp exhibited well defined anomaly at below
90 K, which decreases with applied field. Though the Cp anomaly/peak at Tc
reduces with applied field, the same is not completely suppressed in high
applied fields of up to 12 Tesla. The Sommerfeld constant ({\gamma}) and Debye
temperature ({\Theta}D) as determined from low temperature fitting of CP(T)
data to Sommerfeld-Debye model, are 10.65 mJ/mole-K2 and 312.3 K respectively.

the role of lower dimension operators. The results for infinitesimal Weyl
rescaling are integrated to finite rescalings $e^{2\sigma}$ to a form which
involves running couplings $g_\sigma$ and which interpolates between IR and UV

rise to broken conformal Ward identities. Expressions for the three loop Yukawa

These results are used to check the gradient flow equations to higher order

modified $\beta$-function, and that the equations provide strong constraints on
the detailed form of the three loop Yukawa $\beta$-function. ${\cal N}=1$

recently developed by Balsara et al. to construct a new class of
computationally efficient high order Lagrangian ADER-WENO one-step ALE finite
volume schemes on unstructured triangular meshes. A nonlinear WENO
reconstruction operator allows the algorithm to achieve high order of accuracy
in space, while high order of accuracy in time is obtained by the use of an
ADER time-stepping technique based on a local space-time Galerkin predictor.
The multidimensional HLL and HLLC Riemann solvers operate at each vertex of the
grid, considering the entire Voronoi neighborhood of each node and allows for
larger time steps than conventional one-dimensional Riemann solvers. The
results produced by the multidimensional Riemann solver are then used twice in
our one-step ALE algorithm: first, as a node solver that assigns a unique
velocity vector to each vertex, in order to preserve the continuity of the
computational mesh; second, as a building block for genuinely multidimensional
numerical flux evaluation that allows the scheme to run with larger time steps
compared to conventional finite volume schemes that use classical
one-dimensional Riemann solvers in normal direction. A rezoning step may be
necessary in order to overcome element overlapping or crossing-over. We apply
the method presented in this article to two systems of hyperbolic conservation
laws, namely the Euler equations of compressible gas dynamics and the equations
of ideal classical magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD). Convergence studies up to
fourth order of accuracy in space and time have been carried out. Several

(iv) it is unbiased and reaches its components' variance as soon as the SNR
exceeds 2; (v) it is analytic and can therefore be used on large data-sets. We
also revisit the construction of its associated confidence intervals and show
how the Feldman-Cousins prescription efficiently solves the issue of classical
intervals lying entirely in the unphysical negative domain. Such intervals can
be used to identify statistically significant polarized regions and conversely
build masks for polarization data. We then consider the case of a general
$[Q,U]$ covariance matrix and perform a generalization of the estimator that
preserves its asymptotic properties. We show that its bias does not depend on
the true polarization angle, and provide an analytic estimate of its variance.
The estimator value, together with its variance, provide a powerful
point-estimate of the true polarization amplitude that follows an unbiased
Gaussian distribution for a SNR as low as 2. These results can be applied to
the much more general case of transforming any normally distributed random
variable from Cartesian to polar coordinates.

the Electron-Tracking Compton Camera (ETCC), and carried out the first
performance test at room condition using several gamma-ray sources in the
sub-MeV energy band. Using a simple track analysis for a quick first test of
the performance, the gamma-ray imaging capability was demonstrated by clear
images and 5.3 degrees of angular resolution measure (ARM) measured at 662 keV.
As the greatest impact of this work, a gamma-ray detection efficiency on the
order of $10^{-4}$ was achieved at the sub-MeV gamma-ray band, which is one
order of magnitude higher than our previous experiment. This angular resolution
and detection efficiency enables us to detect the Crab Nebula at the 5 sigma
level with several hours observation at balloon altitude in middle latitude.
Furthermore, good consistency of efficiencies between this performance test and
simulation including only physical processes has a large importance; it means
we achieve nearly 100% detection of Compton recoil electrons. Thus, our
estimation of enhancements by upgrades of the detector is more dependable. We
are planning to confirm the imaging capability of the ETCC by observation of
celestial objects in the SMILE-II (Sub-MeV gamma ray Imaging Loaded-on-balloon
Experiment II). The SMILE-II and following SMILE-III project will be an
important key of sub-MeV/MeV gamma-ray astronomy.

and bounded degree graphs. This led to elegant limiting structures called
graphons and graphings. These approach have been unified and generalized by
authors in a more general setting using a combination of analytic tools and
model theory to FO-limits (and X-limits) and to the notion of modeling. The
existence of modeling limits was established for sequences in a bounded degree
class and, in addition, to the case of classes of trees with bounded height and
of graphs with bounded tree depth. These seemingly very special classes is in
fact a key step in the development of limits for more general situations. The
natural obstacle for the existence of modeling limit for a monotone class of

sufficient condition. Extending earlier results we derive several general
results which present a realistic approach to this conjecture. As an example we
then prove that the class of all finite trees admits modeling limits.

persistent gamma-ray counterpart in the Fermi-LAT domain, 2FGL 1227.7-4853.
Here, we present the results of the analysis of recent INTEGRAL observations,
aimed at assessing the long-term variability of the hard X-ray emission, and
thus the stability of the accretion state. We confirm that the source behaves
as a persistent hard X-ray emitter between 2003 and 2012. We propose that XSS
J12270-4859 hosts a neutron star in a propeller state, a state we investigate
in detail, developing a theoretical model to reproduce the associated X-ray and
gamma-ray properties. This model can be understood as being of a more general
nature, representing a viable alternative by which LMXBs can appear as
gamma-ray sources. In particular, this may apply to the case of millisecond
pulsars performing a transition from a state powered by the rotation of their
magnetic field, to a state powered by matter in-fall, such as that recently
observed from the transitional pulsar PSR J1023+0038. While the surface
magnetic field of a typical NS in a LMXB is lower by more than four orders of
magnitude than the much more intense fields of neutron stars accompanying
high-mass binaries, the radius at which the matter in-flow is truncated in a
NS-LMXB system is much lower. The magnetic field at the magnetospheric
interface is then orders of magnitude larger at this interface, and as
consequence, so is the power to accelerate electrons. We demonstrate that the
cooling of the accelerated electron population takes place mainly through
synchrotron interaction with the magnetic field permeating the interface, and
through inverse Compton losses due to the interaction between the electrons and
the synchrotron photons they emit. We found that self-synchrotron Compton
processes can explain the high energy phenomenology of XSS J12270-4859.

orientation during their evolution which directly affects their
geoeffectiveness. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how solar FRs evolve
in the heliosphere to improve our space weather forecasting tools. We analyze
15 coronal mass ejections (CMEs), with clear FR signatures, observed during the
decay of Solar Cycle 23 and rise of Solar Cycle 24. We estimate initial
orientations of the FRs at the origin using extreme ultraviolet observations of
post-eruption arcades and/or eruptive prominences. Then we reconstruct
multiviewpoint coronagraph observations of the CMEs from ~2 to 30 Rs with a
three-dimensional geometric representation of a FR to determine their
geometrical parameters. Finally, we propagate the FRs from ~30 Rs to 1 AU
through MHD-simulated background solar wind while using in-situ measurements at
1 AU of the associated magnetic cloud as a constraint for the propagation
technique. These methodology allows us to estimate the FR orientation all the
way from the Sun to 1 AU. We find that while the FRs deflection occurs
predominantly below 30 Rs, a significant amount of deflection and rotation
happens between 30 Rs and 1 AU. We compare the FR orientation to the local
orientation of the heliospheric current sheet (HCS). We find that slow FRs tend
to align with the streams of slow solar wind in the inner heliosphere. During
the solar cycle minimum the slow solar wind channel as well as the HCS usually
occupy the area in the vicinity of the solar equatorial plane, which in the
past led researchers to the hypothesis that FRs align with the HCS. Our results
show that exclusions from this rule are explained by interaction with the
Parker-spiralled background magnetic field, which dominates over the magnetic
interaction with the HCS in the inner heliosphere at least during solar minimum
conditions.

Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using near- to mid-infrared images taken by
Infrared Array Camera (IRAC; 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8 {\mu}m) and Multiband Imaging
Photometer (MIPS; 24 and 70 {\mu}m) onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope. Among
the 47 bona fide LMC SNRs, 29 were detected in infrared, giving a high
detection rate of 62%. All 29 SNRs show emission at 24 {\mu}m, and 20 out of 29
show emission in one or several IRAC bands. We present their 4.5, 8, 24, and 70
{\mu}m images and a table summarizing their Spitzer fluxes. We find that the
LMC SNRs are considerably fainter than the Galactic SNRs, and that, among the
LMC SNRs, Type Ia SNRs are significantly fainter than core-collapse SNRs. We
conclude that the MIPS emission of essentially all SNRs origi- nates from dust
emission, whereas their IRAC emissions originate from ionic/molecular lines,
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons emission, or synchrotron emission. The
infrared fluxes show correlation with radio and X-ray fluxes. For SNRs that
have similar mor- phology in infrared and X-rays, the ratios of 24 to 70 {\mu}m
fluxes have good correlation with the electron density of hot plasma. The
overall correlation is explained well by the emission from collisionally-heated
silicate grains of 0.1 {\mu}m size, but for mature SNRs with relatively low gas
temperatures, the smaller-sized grain population is favored more. For those
that appear different between infrared and X-rays, the emission in the MIPS
bands is probably from dust heated by shock radiation.

complexity of the method is $\tilde{O}_B(N^{10})$ for the bivariate case, where
$N=\max(d,\tau)$, $d$ resp., $\tau$ is an upper bound on the degree, resp., the

design patterns; building these with both generic and bespoke patterns should
reduce duplication and increase regularity which in turn should impact on the
cost of development.
  Here we report on the usage of patterns applied to two biomedical ontologies:
firstly a novel ontology for karyotypes which has been built ground-up using a
pattern based approach; and, secondly, our initial refactoring of the SIO
ontology to make explicit use of patterns at development time. To enable this,
we use the Tawny-OWL library which enables full-programmatic development of
ontologies. We show how this approach can generate large numbers of classes
from much simpler data structures which is highly beneficial within biomedical
ontology engineering.

Mokhov. In 2D, they are generated by a pair of compatible flat metrics $g$ and
$\tilde g$ which satisfy a set of additional constraints coming from the
skew-symmetry condition and the Jacobi identity. We demonstrate that these
constraints are equivalent to the requirement that $\tilde g$ is a linear
Killing tensor of $g$ with zero Nijenhuis torsion. This allowed us to obtain a
complete classification of $n$-component operators with $n\leq 4$ (for $n=1, 2$
this was done before). For 2D operators the Darboux theorem does not hold: the
operator may not be reducible to constant coefficient form. All interesting
(non-constant) examples correspond to the case when the flat pencil $g, \tilde
g$ is not semisimple, that is, the affinor $\tilde g g^{-1}$ has non-trivial
Jordan block structure. In the case of a direct sum of Jordan blocks with
distinct eigenvalues we obtain a complete classification of Hamiltonian
operators for any number of components $n$, revealing a remarkable

However, in spite of existing research efforts \cite{chi2013compressive}, it
was still an open problem how to formulate an equivalent positive semidefinite
program for atomic norm minimization in recovering signals with $d$-dimensional
($d\geq 2$) off-the-grid frequencies. In this paper, we settle this problem by
proposing equivalent semidefinite programming formulations of atomic norm
minimization to recover signals with $d$-dimensional ($d\geq 2$) off-the-grid
frequencies.

the Karsten-Wilczek class in the quenched approximation. This requires fixing
the counterterms, which arise due to hypercubic symmetry breaking induced by
the Karsten-Wilczek term. Non-perturbative renormalisation criteria are
formulated after a detailed study of the parameter dependence of mesonic
observables. Minimisation of the mass anisotropy of the pseudoscalar ground
state fixes non-perturbative renormalisation conditions for the counterterm
coefficients. These anisotropies are mapped out by probing different euclidean
components of the transfer matrix through calculations of the pseudoscalar
ground state mass in different directions. The chiral behaviour of the
pseudoscalar ground state is studied with the tuned Karsten-Wilczek action for
multiple lattice spacings. Light pseudoscalar masses ($ M_{PS} \lesssim
250\,MeV $) were achieved in the quenched approximation without encountering
exceptional configurations. The presence of quenched chiral logarithms is
studied under the tentative assumption of Goldstone Boson-like behaviour.

building is at full capacity. We present an evacuation support system which
does this regardless of the number of evacuees. The core concept is to even-out
congestion in the building by diverting evacuees to less-congested paths in
order to make maximal usage of all accessible routes throughout the entire
evacuation process. The system issues a set of flow-optimal routes using a
capacity-constrained routing algorithm which anticipates evolutions in path
metrics using the concept of ""future capacity reservation"". In order to direct
evacuees in an intuitive manner whilst implementing the routing algorithm's
scheme, we use dynamic exit signs, i.e. whose pointing direction can be
controlled. To make this system practical and minimise reliance on sensors
during the evacuation, we use an evacuee mobility model and make several
assumptions on the characteristics of the evacuee flow. We validate this
concept using simulations, and show how the underpinning assumptions may limit
the system's performance, especially in low-headcount evacuations.

single species models, covering the conceptual bases, touching on mechanistic

environmental data to predict distributions. The commentary in this last
section is oriented towards key issues that arise in fitting, and predicting
with, these models (which include CLIMEX, MaxEnt and other regression methods).
In other words, it is more about the process of thinking about the data and the
modelling problem (which is a challenging one) than it is about one technique
versus another. The discussion helps clarify the necessary steps and expertise
for predicting distributions. Some researchers are optimistic that correlative
models will predict with high precision; while that may be true for some
species at some scales of evaluation, I believe that the issues discussed in
this chapter show that substantial errors are reasonably likely. I am hopeful
that ongoing developments will produce models better suited to the task and
tools to help practitioners to better understand predictions and their
uncertainties.

that the ribosome discriminates correct codon-anticodon pair because of its
higher stability. Here an alternative explanation of kinetic proofreading is
suggested, and intramolecular oscillations in tRNAs play a keystone role in it.
Resonance of the oscillations allows the cognate codon-anticodon pair to be
conserved due to fast energy transfer to other part of the tRNA molecule. This
mechanism can potentially discriminate correct pair from an incorrect one even
if they have similar stabilities.

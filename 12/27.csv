mobility, congestion and node failures. Many approaches have been proposed in
literature to solve this problem, where a node predicts pre-emptively the route
failure that occurs with the less received power. However, this approach
encounters some difficulties, especially in scenario without mobility where
route failures may arise. In this paper, we propose an improvement of AODV
protocol called LO-PPAODV (Link Quality and MAC-Overhead aware Predictive
Preemptive AODV). This protocol is based on new metric combine more routing
metrics (Link Quality, MAC Overhead) between each node and one hop neighbor.
Also we propose a cross-layer networking mechanism to distinguish between both
situations, failures due to congestion or mobility, and consequently avoiding
unnecessary route repair process. The LO-PPAODV was implemented using NS-2. The
simulation results show that our approach improves the overall performance of
the network. It reduces the average end to end delay, the routing overhead, MAC
errors and route errors, and increases the packet delivery fraction of the
network.

usually resort to `trick' and fit our experimental data to the quantity called

wide range of different bulk behavior due to the peculiarity of the particle
interaction. We use Discrete Element simulations to investigate the effect of
contact cohesion on the steady state of dense powders in a slowly sheared
split-bottom Couette cell, which imposes a wide stable shear band. The
intensity of cohesive forces can be quantified by the {\em granular Bond
number} ($Bo$), namely the ratio between maximum attractive force and average
force due to external compression. We find that the shear banding phenomenon is
almost independent of cohesion for Bond numbers $Bo<1$, but for $Bo \ge 1$
cohesive forces start to play an important role, as both width and center
position of the band increase for $Bo > 1$. Inside the shear band, the mean
normal contact force is always independent of cohesion and depends only on the
confining stress. In contrast, when the behavior is analyzed focusing on the
eigen-directions of the local strain rate tensor, a dependence on cohesion
shows up. Forces carried by contacts along the compressive and tensile
directions are symmetric about the mean force (larger and smaller
respectively), while the force along the third, neutral direction follows the
mean force. This anisotropy of the force network increases with cohesion, just
like the heterogeneity in all (compressive, tensile and neutral) directions.

  Networks","A shorter version of the paper has been submitted to ISIT 2014",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In cloud radio access networks (C-RANs), the baseband processing of the radio
units (RUs) is migrated to remote control units (CUs). This is made possible by
a network of backhaul links that connects RUs and CUs and that carries
compressed baseband signals. While prior work has focused mostly on single-hop
backhaul networks, this paper investigates efficient backhaul compression
strategies for the uplink of C-RANs with a general multihop backhaul topology.
A baseline multiplex-and-forward (MF) scheme is first studied in which each RU
forwards the bit streams received from the connected RUs without any
processing. It is observed that this strategy may cause significant performance
degradation in the presence of a dense deployment of RUs with a well connected
backhaul network. To obviate this problem, a scheme is proposed in which each
RU decompresses the received bit streams and performs linear in-network
processing of the decompressed signals. For both the MF and the
decompress-process-and-recompress (DPR) backhaul schemes, the optimal design is
addressed with the aim of maximizing the sum-rate under the backhaul capacity
constraints. Recognizing the significant demands of the optimal solution of the
DPR scheme in terms of channel state information (CSI) at the RUs,
decentralized optimization algorithms are proposed under the assumption of
limited CSI at the RUs. Numerical results are provided to compare the
performance of the MF and DPR schemes, highlighting the potential advantage of
in-network processing and the impact of CSI limitations.

Research in Microbiology 141, 529 (1990)]. We show that the measured
anisotropic elasticity of the PG sacculus can lead to stable circumferential
propagation of small gaps in the sacculus. This is consistent with the recent
observation of circumferential propagation of PG-associated MreB patches in
rod-shaped bacteria. We also find a bistable regime of both circumferential and
axial gap propagation, which agrees with behavior reported in cytoskeletal
mutants of B. subtilis. We conclude that the elastic anisotropies of a
bacterial sacculus, as characterised experimentally, may be relevant for
maintaining rod-shaped bacterial growth.

field theory. Disordered systems are characterized by a random energy landscape
due to heterogeneities, which remains fixed on the time scales of the phenomena
considered. I focus specifically on elastic interfaces in random media, such as
pinned domain walls in ferromagnets containing defects, fluid contact lines on
rough surfaces, etc. The goal is to understand static properties (e.g. the
roughness) of such systems, and their dynamics in response to an external
force. The interface moves in avalanches, triggered at random points in time,
separated by long periods of quiescence. For magnetic domain walls, this
phenomenon is known as Barkhausen noise. I first study the model of a particle
in a Brownian random force landscape, applicable to high-dimensional
interfaces. Its exact solution for a monotonous, but time-varying driving force
is obtained. This allows computing the joint distribution of avalanche sizes
and durations, and their spatial and temporal shape. I then generalize these
results to a short-range correlated disorder. Using the functional
renormalization group, I compute the universal distributions of avalanche
sizes, durations, and their average shape as a function of time. The
corrections with respect to the Brownian model become important in sufficiently
low dimension (e.g. for a crack front in the fracture of a solid). I then
discuss connections to the rough phase of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang nonlinear surface
growth, and an application to the variable-range hopping model of electric
conductance in a disordered insulator.

characterized by three parameters, i.e., the depth ($D$), the half-width ($w$),

with $w$, and decreases linearly with $D$ and $h$. The dependence is fitted

functions of the perimeter length of convex hulls determined by physical

described by a self-consistent microscopic calculation with the continuum
particle-vibration coupling (cPVC) method. The SLy5, SkM*, and SGII parameters
are adopted as an effective nucleon-nucleon interaction. For all the
parameters, the cPVC calculation reproduces very well the first peak at 4.65
MeV in the $^{24}$O excitation energy spectrum as well as its angular
distribution. The role of the cPVC self-energy strongly depends on the
effective interactions. The higher-lying strength around 7.3 MeV is suggested
to be a superposition of the $3^-$ and $4^+$ states by the results with SLy5
and SGII, whereas the SkM* calculation indicates it is a pure $3^-$ state. This
difference gives a rather strong interaction dependence of the angular
distribution corresponding to the higher-lying strength.

(ODIA) for interference-limited cellular downlink, which intelligently combines
user scheduling and downlink IA techniques. The proposed ODIA not only
efficiently reduces the effect of inter-cell interference from other-cell base
stations (BSs) but also eliminates intra-cell interference among spatial
streams in the same cell. We show that the minimum number of users required to
achieve a target degrees-of-freedom (DoF) can be fundamentally reduced, i.e.,
the fundamental user scaling law can be improved by using the ODIA, compared
with the existing downlink IA schemes. In addition, we adopt a limited feedback
strategy in the ODIA framework, and then analyze the required number of
feedback bits leading to the same performance as that of the ODIA assuming
perfect feedback. We also modify the original ODIA in order to further improve
sum-rate, which achieves the optimal multiuser diversity gain, i.e., $\log \log
N$, per spatial stream even in the presence of downlink inter-cell
interference, where $N$ denotes the number of users in a cell. Simulation
results show that the ODIA significantly outperforms existing interference
management techniques in terms of sum-rate in realistic cellular environments.
Note that the ODIA operates in a distributed and decoupled manner, while
requiring no information exchange among BSs and no iterative beamformer
optimization between BSs and users, thus leading to an easier implementation.

can overcome van der Waals attraction. This repulsive force is substantial in a
large range of temperatures, mixture composition and salt concentrations. The
increased repulsion due to addition of salt occurs even for charged colloids.

networks (MANETs) is of great importance for supporting Quality of Service
(QoS) guaranteed applications in such networks. While upper bounds and
approximations for end-to-end delay in MANETs have been developed in
literature, which usually introduce significant errors in delay analysis, the
modeling of exact end-to-end delay in MANETs remains a technical challenge.
This is partially due to the highly dynamical behaviors of MANETs, but also due
to the lack of an efficient theoretical framework to capture such dynamics.
This paper demonstrates the potential application of the powerful
Quasi-Birth-and-Death (QBD) theory in tackling the challenging issue of exact
end-to-end delay modeling in MANETs. We first apply the QBD theory to develop
an efficient theoretical framework for capturing the complex dynamics in
MANETs. We then show that with the help of this framework, closed form models
can be derived for the analysis of exact end-to-end delay and also per node
throughput capacity in MANETs. Simulation and numerical results are further
provided to illustrate the efficiency of these QBD theory-based models as well
as our theoretical findings.

strictly ergodic model. Strengthening the model by requiring that it is
strictly ergodic under some group actions, and building the connection of the
new model with the convergence of pointwise non-conventional ergodic averages
we prove that for an ergodic system $(X,\X,\mu, T)$, $d\in\N$, $f_1, \ldots,
f_d \in L^{\infty}(\mu)$, %and any tempered F{\rm ${\o}$}lner sequence $F_n$ of

measures of dependence between two random variables. To this end, they proposed
a novel measure, the maximal information coefficient (MIC). Recently a PNAS
paper (Kinney and Atwal, 2014) gave a mathematical definition for equitability.
They proved that MIC in fact is not equitable, while a fundamental information
theoretic measure, the mutual information (MI), is self-equitable. In this
paper, we show that MI also does not correctly reflect the proportion of
deterministic signals hidden in noisy data. We propose a new equitability
definition based on this scenario. The copula correlation (Ccor), based on the
L1-distance of copula density, is shown to be equitable under both definitions.
We also prove theoretically that Ccor is much easier to estimate than MI.
Numerical studies illustrate the properties of the measures.

required. While persistent homology is quite efficient in the topological and
qualitative comparison of this kind of data when the invariance group $G$ is
the group $\mathrm{Homeo}(X)$ of all self-homeomorphisms of $X$, this theory is
not tailored to manage the case in which $G$ is a proper subgroup of

This paper proposes a way to adapt persistent homology in order to get

The main idea consists in a dual approach, based on considering the set of all

O II lines in the main sequence (MS) early B- and late O-type stars is
examined. This analysis is based on a fact of primary importance for this
problem: the C II, N II, and O II ions in atmospheres of these stars are
photoionized by radiation in the far UV. Observations show that the actual flux
in this range for hot stars can be considerably higher than theoretical levels;
thus, overionization of the C II, N II, and O II ions beyond the ionization
calculated with the standard model atmospheres occurs in the actual atmospheres
of these stars. Underestimates in the calculated ionization lead to reduced
values of the C, N, and O abundances. This is confirmed by the observed
dependence on the effective temperature Teff: the C, N and O abundances tend to
be lower with increasing Teff. It is shown that overionization becomes
significant for sufficiently hot stars, namely when Teff>18500 K for the C II
lines and when Teff>26000 K for the N II and O II lines. The systematic
difference in the C, N and O abundances between these relatively hot stars and
the cooler B-type MS stars is about 0.2 dex. The relatively cool B-type MS
stars (Teff<18100 K for C II and Teff<25000 K for N II and O II) yield the
undistorted C, N and O abundances, and their average values agree very well
with modern estimates for the Sun. It is noted that when an alternative method
based on examining the ionization balance (e.g., He I-II, C II-III, Ne I-II, Si
III-IV) is used to determine the parameters Teff and log g, the overionization
problem essentially vanishes; however, this method leads to a systematic
enhancement in Teff and log g. The overionization problem can be solved by
shifting to the improved model atmospheres for early B- and late O-type stars
that takes their sphericity into account and, possibly, stellar winds and
magnetic fields.

associated with Cepheus A (Cep A) HW2 using Very Long Baseline Interferometery
(VLBI) observations. We conducted three epochs of VLBI monitoring observations
of the 6.7 GHz methanol masers in Cep A-HW2 with the Japanese VLBI Network
(JVN) over the period between 2006-2008. In 2006, we were able to use
phase-referencing to measure the absolute coordinates of the maser emission
with an accuracy of a few milliarcseconds. We compared the maser distribution
with other molecular line observations that trace the rotating disk. We
measured the internal proper motions for 29 methanol maser spots, of which 19
were identified at all three epochs and the remaining ten at only two epochs.
The magnitude of proper motions ranged from 0.2 to 7.4 km/s, with an average of
3.1 km/s. Although there are large uncertainties in the observed internal
proper motions of the methanol maser spots in Cep A, they are well fitted by a
disk that includes both rotation and infall velocity components. The derived
rotation and infall velocities at the disk radius of 680 au are 0.5 +- 0.7 and
1.8 +- 0.7 km/s, respectively. Assuming that the modeled disk motion accurately
represents the accretion disk around the Cep A-HW2 high-mass YSO, we estimated
the mass infall rate to be 3 x 10^{-4} n_8 Msun/yr (n_8 is the gas volume
density in units of 10^{8} cm^{-3}). The combination of the estimated mass
infall rate and the magnitude of the fitted infall velocity suggests that Cep
A-HW2 is at an evolutionary phase of active gas accretion from the disk onto
the central high-mass YSO. The infall momentum rate is estimated to be 5 x
10^{-4} n_8 Msun/yr km/s, which is larger than the estimated stellar radiation
pressure of the HW2 object, supporting the hypothesis that this object is in an
active gas accretion phase.

acceleration rate $\ddot S S^{-1}$ of the cosmic scale factor $S(t)$, it is
shown that the orbit of a local binary undergoes a secular expansion. To first
order in the power expansion of $\ddot S S^{-1}$ around the present epoch
$t_0$, a non-vanishing shift per orbit $\left\langle\Delta r\right\rangle$ of
the two-body relative distance $r$ occurs for eccentric trajectories. A general
relativistic expression, which turns out to be cubic in the Hubble parameter
$H_0$ at the present epoch, is explicitly calculated for it in the case of
matter-dominated epochs with Dark Energy. For a highly eccentric Oort comet
orbit with period $P_{\rm b}\approx 31$ Myr, the general relativistic distance
shift per orbit turns out to be of the order of $\left\langle\Delta
r\right\rangle\approx 70$ km. For the Large Magellanic Cloud, assumed on a
bound elliptic orbit around the Milky Way, the shift per orbit is of the order
of $\left\langle\Delta r\right\rangle\approx 2-4$ pc. Our result has a general
validity since it holds in any cosmological model admitting the Hubble law and
a slowly varying $\ddot S S^{-1}(t)$. More generally, it is valid for an
arbitrary Hooke-like extra-acceleration whose \virg{elastic} parameter
$\mathcal{K}$ is slowly time-dependent, irrespectively of the physical
mechanism which may lead to it. The coefficient $\mathcal{K}_1$ of the
first-order term of the power expansion of $\mathcal{K}(t)$ can be
preliminarily constrained in a model-independent way down to a
$\mathcal{K}_1\lesssim 2\times 10^{-13}$ yr$^{-3}$ level from latest Solar
System's planetary observations. The radial velocities of the double lined
spectroscopic binary $\alpha$ Cen AB yield $\mathcal{K}_1\lesssim 10^{-8}$

the space of paths of an $N$-graded graph (Bratteli diagram). It is based on
the notion of standardness of the tail filtration in the space of paths, and
the smoothness criterion uses the so-called intrinsic metric which can be
canonically defined on the set of vertices of these graphs. In many cases known
to the author, like the Pascal graph, the Young graph, the space of
configurations, all ergodic central measures are smooth (in this case, we say
that the graph is smooth). But even in these cases, the intrinsic metric is far
from being obvious and does not coincide with the ""natural"" metric. We apply
and generalize the theory of filtrations developed by the author during the
last forty years to the case of tail filtrations and, in particular, introduce
the notion of a standard filtration as a generalization to the case of
semi-homogeneous filtrations of the notion of a standard homogeneous (dyadic)
filtration in the sense of that theory. The crucial role is played by the new
notion of \textbf{intrinsic semi-metric on the set of vertices of a graph} and
the notion of regular paths, which allows us to refine the ergodic method for
the case of smooth measures. In future, we will apply this new approach to the
theory of invariant measures in combinatorics, ergodic theory, and the theory
of C$^*$-algebras.

numerical approximations, focusing on how different discretization schemes
impact the accuracy of approximate solution moments. Pursuing the eventual goal
of comparing simulated solutions to experimental data, we must carefully choose
the numerical method most appropriate to the type of data we attain. Within
this context, we compare and contrast the accuracy and computational cost of a

  Our study provides theoretical and numerical evidence that the finite element
approach achieves much more accuracy when the system aggregates slowly, and it
does so with much less computation cost. Conversely, the finite volume method
is slightly more accurate approximating the zeroth moment when the system
aggregates quickly and is much more accurate approximating the first moment in
general.
  Lastly, our study also provides numerical evidence that the finite element
method (conventionally considered first order) actually belongs to a class of
discontinuous Galerkin methods that exhibit superconvergence, or second order
in our case.

been performed over three years with remarkable detection efficiency featuring
a smooth operation, high live time, and high reliability. About 3000 CNGS
neutrino events have been collected and are being actively analyzed. ICARUS
will now be moved to CERN for an extensive R&D program. The T600 detector will
be overhauled and complemented with a similar T150 detector. These improvements
are performed in collaboration with the LBNE experiment, of which several INFN
Institutions are now members. As a novelty, a SC magnetic field of about 1 T
will be introduced. During 2016 it is proposed to move the experiment to FNAL
where short base line neutrino beams are available, complementing the approved
MicroBooNe experiment which will start operation in 2014. The ICARUS detectors
at FNAL will be an important addition since, in absence of anomalies, the
signals of several detectors at different distances from the target should be a
copy of each other for all experimental signatures. Due to the reduced mass, in
MicroBooNE the anti-neutrino signal is too weak for a sensitive comparison.
Hence, a definitive clarification of the LSND anomaly requires the exploration
of the anti-neutrino signal provided by the much larger T600. The magnetic
field will allow separating the anti-neutrino signal from the neutrino-induced
background. It is proposed to expose the T600 at the Booster NuBeam at ~700 m
from target; the T150 will be located at ~150 m. The T600 will also receive
>10^4 nu_e events/year from the off-axis NUMI beam peaked around 1 GeV and
exploitable to prepare for the LBNE experiment. The ICARUS teams are also

attributes, that are related to the way in which they connect to other nodes.
Sometimes this relationship is simple, for instance nodes of the same class are
may be more likely to be connected. In other cases, however, this is not true,
and the way that nodes link in a network exhibits a different, more complex
relationship to their attributes. Here, we consider networks in which we know
how the nodes are connected, but we do not know the class labels of the nodes
or how class labels relate to the network links. We wish to identify the best
subset of nodes to label in order to learn this relationship between node
attributes and network links. We can then use this discovered relationship to
accurately predict the class labels of the rest of the network nodes.
  We present a model that identifies groups of nodes with similar link
patterns, which we call network roles, using a generative blockmodel. The model
then predicts labels by learning the mapping from network roles to class labels
using a maximum margin classifier. We choose a subset of nodes to label
according to an iterative margin-based active learning strategy. By integrating
the discovery of network roles with the classifier optimisation, the active
learning process can adapt the network roles to better represent the network
for node classification. We demonstrate the model by exploring a selection of
real world networks, including a marine food web and a network of English
words. We show that, in contrast to other network classifiers, this model
achieves good classification accuracy for a range of networks with different

examine steady state, small signal, electrical response of AlGaInP based
multi-quantum well laser diodes to identify and investigate the presence of
excitons in electroluminescence. This frequency dependent response shows bias
activated capacitance following a phenomenological rate equation. Dynamic
dependence of this response on frequency reverses after light emission. This
results in negative activation energy which we explain with the formation of a
stable, intermediate transition state whose average energy matches well with
excitonic binding energy of these III-V semiconductors. Hence we identify the
presence of excitons which are also responsible for observed
electroluminescence at low charge injections by electrical measurements alone.
Further increase in charge injection suppresses the electrical signature of
excitons representing their Mott transition into electron-hole plasma which is
supported by standard optical measurements. This kind of correlation between
electrical and optical properties of excitons was not systematically
investigated in the past. Therefore, this study demonstrates a fresh

with a fitting stage, then with a projection stage. Model fitting has, so far,

simulations of this search process, we show that the organisation of the
binding sites, in conjunction with TF copy number and binding site affinity,
plays an important role in determining not only the steady state of promoter
occupancy, but also the order at which TFs bind. These effects can be captured
by facilitated diffusion-based models, but not by standard thermodynamics. We
show that the spacing of binding sites encodes complex logic, which can be
derived from combinations of three basic building blocks: switches, barriers
and clusters, whose response alone and in higher orders of organisation we
characterise in detail. Effective promoter organizations are commonly found in
the E. coli genome and are highly conserved between strains. This will allow
studies of gene regulation at a previously unprecedented level of detail, where
our framework can create testable hypothesis of promoter logic.

that the Frobenius distance $\lVert M-M'\rVert$ is small. We propose a
Newton-like iteration for solving this problem, whose main feature is that it
converges locally quadratically to such a matrix under mild transversality
assumptions between the manifold of matrices of rank $r$ and the linear/affine

  pulsars and soft gamma-ray repeaters","Accepted for publication in A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201322303",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the fallback disk model for the persistent emission of Anomalous X-ray
pulsars (AXPs) and soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs), the hard X-ray emission
arises from bulk- and thermal Comptonization of bremsstrahlung photons, which
are generated in the accretion column. The relatively low X-ray luminosity of
these sources implies a moderate transverse optical depth to electron
scattering, with photons executing a small number of shock crossings before
escaping sideways. We explore the range of spectral shapes that can be obtained
with this model and characterize the most important parameter dependencies. We
use a Monte Carlo code to study the crisscrossing of photons in a radiative
shock in an accretion column and compute the resulting spectrum. As expected,
high-energy power-law X-ray spectra are produced in radiative shocks with
photon-number spectral index larger than or about 0.5. We find that the
required transverse optical depth is between 1 and 7. Such spectra are observed
in low-luminosity X-ray pulsars. We demonstrate here with a simple model that
Compton upscattering in the radiative shock in the accretion column can produce
hard X-ray spectra similar to those seen in the persistent and transient
emission of AXPs and SGRs. In particular, one can obtain a high-energy
power-law spectrum, with photon-number spectral index ~ 1 and a cutoff at 100 -
200 keV, with a transverse Thomson optical depth of ~ 5, which is shown to be
typical in AXPs/SGRs.

levels tend to lie far from the Fermi energy of the metal contact,
necessitating undesirably large gate and bias voltages in molecular electronics
applications. Molecular radicals are an exception because their partly filled
orbitals undergo Kondo screening, opening the way to electron passage even at
zero bias. While that phenomenon has been experimentally demonstrated for
several complex organic radicals, quantitative theoretical predictions have not
been attempted so far. It is therefore an open question whether and to what
extent an ab initio-based theory is able to make accurate predictions for Kondo
temperatures and conductance lineshapes. Choosing nitric oxide NO as a simple
and exemplary spin 1/2 molecular radical, we present calculations based on a
combination of density functional theory and numerical renormalization group
(DFT+NRG) predicting a zero bias spectral anomaly with a Kondo temperature of
15 K for NO/Au(111). A scanning tunneling spectroscopy study is subsequently
carried out to verify the prediction, and a striking zero bias Kondo anomaly is
confirmed, still quite visible at liquid nitrogen temperatures. Comparison
shows that the experimental Kondo temperature of about 43 K is larger than the
theoretical one, while the inverted Fano lineshape implies a strong source of
interference not included in the model. These discrepancies are not a surprise,
providing in fact an instructive measure of the approximations used in the
modeling, which supports and qualifies the viability of the DFT+NRG approach to
the prediction of conductance anomalies in larger molecular radicals.

more particles. This restriction is generally called monogamy. However the
formal quantification of such restriction is only known for some measures of
entanglement and for two-level systems. The first and broadly known monogamy
relation was established by Coffman, Kundu, and Wootters for the square of the
concurrence. Since then, it is usually said that the entanglement of formation
is not monogamous, as it does not obey the same relation. We show here that
despite that, the entanglement of formation cannot be freely shared and
therefore should be said to be monogamous. Furthermore, the square of the
entanglement of formation does obey the same relation of the squared
concurrence, a fact recently noted for three particles and extended here for N
particles. Therefore the entanglement of formation is as monogamous as the
concurrence. We also numerically study how the entanglement is distributed in
pure states of three qubits and the relation between the sum of the bipartite
entanglement and the classical correlation.

telecommunications and computer networks. We consider the popular
Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible spreading model as the metric for information
spreading. In this work, we analyze information spreading on a particular class
of networks denoted almost torus networks and over the lattice which can be
considered as the limit when the torus length goes to infinity. Almost torus
networks consist on the torus network topology where some nodes or edges have
been removed. We find explicit expressions for the characteristic polynomial of
these graphs and tight lower bounds for its computation. These expressions
allow us to estimate their spectral radius and thus how the information spreads
on these networks.

conditions, which lead to nontrivial symmetry breaking, practically contribute
to the partition function. In particular, we show that for $SU(5)$ gauge group,

reconstructing continuous random media based on Bayesian compressive sensing.
In addition to providing maximum a posteriori estimates of the unknown weights,
Bayesian inversion provides estimate of the confidence level of the solution,
as well as a systematic approach for optimizing subsequent measurement(s) to
maximize information gain. We impose sparsity priors directly on spatial
harmonics to exploit the spatial correlation exhibited by continuous media, and
solve for their posterior probability density functions efficiently using a
fast relevance vector machine. We linearize the problem using the first-order
Born approximation which enables us to combine, in a single inversion,
measurements from multiple transmitters and ultrawideband frequencies. We
extend the method to high-contrast media using the distorted-Born iterative
method. We apply time-reversal strategies to adaptively focus the inversion
effort onto subdomains of interest, and hence reduce the overall inversion
cost. The proposed techniques are illustrated in a number of canonical
scenarios including crosshole and borehole sensing.

explain how the S-Q limits are redefined in the presence of the non-ideal

very high degree, even with significantly imperfect materials.

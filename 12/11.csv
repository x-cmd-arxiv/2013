that a serious contender for the driver of the variations is stochastic,

small-scaled structures seen in the winds of hot luminous stars. In addition to
small-scale stochastic behaviour, subsurface convection guided by a global

bottom-up modeling of complex stochastic systems. APNs are similar to
Stochastic Petri Nets (SPNs) in as much as they both rely on component-based
representation of system state space, in contrast to Markov chains that
explicitly model the states of an entire system. In both frameworks, so-called
tokens (denoted as small circles) represent individual entities comprising the
system; however, SPN graphs contain two distinct types of nodes (called places
and transitions) with transitions serving the purpose of routing tokens among
places. As a result, a pair of place nodes in SPNs can be linked to each other
only via a transient stop, a transition node. In contrast, APN graphs link
place nodes directly by arcs (transitions), similar to state space diagrams for
Markov chains, and separate transition nodes are not needed.
  Tokens in APN are distinct and have labels that can assume both discrete
values (""colors"") and continuous values (""ages""), both of which can change
during simulation. Component interactions are modeled in APNs using triggers,
which are either inhibitors or enablers (the inhibitors' opposites).
Hierarchical construction of APNs rely on using stacks (layers) of submodels
with automatically matching color policies. As a result, APNs provide at least
the same modeling power as SPNs, but, as demonstrated by means of several
examples, the resulting models are often more compact and transparent,
therefore facilitating more efficient performance evaluation of complex
systems.

of Information and Comunication Technologies (ICTs). Good governance and ICT
management are essential for delivering value, managing technological risks,
managing resources and performance measurement. In addition, outsourcing is a
strategic option which complements IT services provided internally in
organizations. This paper proposes the design of a new holistic maturity model
based on standards ISO/IEC 20000 and ISO/IEC 38500, the frameworks and best
practices of ITIL and COBIT, with a specific focus on IT outsourcing. This
model is validated by practices in the field of higher education, using a
questionnaire and a metrics table among other measurement tools. Models,
standards and guidelines are proposed in the model for facilitating adaptation
to universities and achieving excellence in the outsourcing of IT services. The
applicability of the model allows an effective transition to a model of good
governance and management of outsourced IT services which, aligned with the
core business of universities (teaching, research and innovation), affect the
effectiveness and efficiency of its management, optimizes its value and
minimizes risks.

  for detecting ergodicity in large stochastic reaction networks","10 pages",,,,"math.PR q-bio.MN q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A reaction network consists of a finite number of species, which interact
through predefined reaction channels. Traditionally such networks were modeled
deterministically, but it is now well-established that when reactant copy
numbers are small, the random timing of the reactions create internal noise
that can significantly affect the macroscopic properties of the system. To
understand the role of noise and quantify its effects, stochastic models are
necessary. In the stochastic setting, the population is described by a
probability distribution, which evolves according to a set of ordinary
differential equations known as the Chemical Master Equation (CME). This set is
infinite in most cases making the CME practically unsolvable. In many
applications, it is important to determine if the solution of a CME has a
globally attracting fixed point. This property is called ergodicity and its
presence leads to several important insights about the underlying dynamics. The
goal of this paper is to present a simple procedure to verify ergodicity in
stochastic reaction networks. We provide a set of simple linear-algebraic
conditions which are sufficient for the network to be ergodic. In particular,
our main condition can be cast as a Linear Feasibility Problem (LFP) which is
essentially the problem of determining the existence of a vector satisfying
certain linear constraints. The inherent scalability of LFPs make our approach
efficient, even for very large networks. We illustrate our procedure through an
example from systems biology.

Hamiltonian Cycle, algorithms running in time 2^{O(tw)}n^{O(1)} -called
single-exponential- existed only on planar and other sparse graph classes,
where tw stands for the treewidth of the n-vertex input graph. This was
recently disproved by Cygan et al. [FOCS 2011], Bodlaender et al. [ICALP 2013],

general graphs for essentially all connectivity problems that were known to be
solvable in single-exponential time on sparse graphs. In this article we
further investigate the role of planarity in connectivity problems
parameterized by treewidth, and convey that several problems can indeed be
distinguished according to their behavior on planar graphs. Known results from
the literature imply that there exist problems, like Cycle Packing, that cannot
be solved in time 2^{o(tw logtw)}n^{O(1)} on general graphs but that can be
solved in time 2^{O(tw)}n^{O(1)} when restricted to planar graphs. Our main
contribution is to show that there exist problems that can be solved in time
2^{O(tw logtw)}n^{O(1)} on general graphs but that cannot be solved in time

prove that Planar Cycle Packing and Planar Disjoint Paths cannot be solved in

to multi-modal logic enriched with features largely used in description logics:
transitivity and relation inclusion assertions.
  The separate addition of either transitive relations or relation hierarchies

shown to stay decidable, by resorting to results already proved in the

the logic including both features is still decidable. The existence of a

the addition of transitive relations and relation hierarchies to such an

  A further result proved in this work is that the logic extending the

satisfiability problem, unless further syntactical restrictions are placed on

essential in order to understand the PT mechanism in more complex acqueous
systems. Our Jastrow correlated AGP wave function ensures an accurate treatment
of electron correlations. Exploiting the advantages of contracting the
primitive basis set over atomic hybrid orbitals, we are able to limit
dramatically the number of variational parameters with a systematic control on
the numerical precision, crucial in order to simulate larger systems. We
investigate energetics and geometrical properties of the Zundel ion as a
function of the oxygen-oxygen distance, taken as reaction coordinate. In both
cases, our QMC results are found in excellent agreement with coupled cluster
CCSD(T) technique, the quantum chemistry ""gold standard"". Calculations on
proton transfer static barriers and dissociation energies display the same
agreement. A comparison with density functional theory (DFT) results in the PBE
approximation points out the crucial role of electron correlations for a
correct description of the PT in the dimer. Our method is able to resolve the
tiny energy differences (~ 0.1 Kcal/mol) and the corresponding structural
variations at which the proton transfer takes place; it combines these features
with a N^3-N^4 scaling with number of particles (favorable with respect to
other post-DFT methods), as proven by a benchmark calculation on a larger
protonated water cluster. The QMC approach used here represents a promising
candidate to provide the first high-level ab initio description of PT in water.

the cloud. On the other hand, as particles become larger their inertia affects
their motions, and they move differently than the air. These inertial dynamics
impact cloud evolution and ultimately climate prediction, since clouds govern
the earth's energy balances. Yet we lack a simple description of the dynamics.
Falkovich et al. describes theoretically a new dynamical mechanism called the
""sling effect"" by which extreme events in the turbulent air cause idealized
inertial cloud particles to break free from the airflow (Falkovich G, Fouxon A,
Stepanov MG 2002 Nature 419, 151). The sling effect thereafter causes particle
trajectories to cross each other within isolated pockets in the flow, which
increases the chance of collisions that form larger particles. We combined
experimental techniques that allow for precise control of a turbulent flow with
three-dimensional tracking of multiple particles at unprecedented resolution.
In this way, we could observe both the sling effect and crossing trajectories
between real particles. We isolated the inertial sling dynamics from those
caused by turbulent advection by conditionally averaging the data. We found the
dynamics to be universal in terms of a local Stokes number that quantifies the
local particle velocity gradients. We measured the probability density of this
quantity, which shows that sharp gradients become more frequent as the global
Stokes number increases. We observed that sharp compressive gradients in the
airflow initiated the sling effect, and that thereafter gradients in the
particle flow ran away and steepened in a way that produced singularities in
the flow in finite time. During this process both the fluid motions and gravity
became unimportant. The results underpin a framework for describing a crucial
aspect of inertial particle dynamics.

subject of much research. In this paper we focus on the ""lower tail"" of such a
matrix, and prove that it is subgaussian under a simple fourth moment
assumption on the one-dimensional marginals of the random vectors. A similar
result holds for more general sums of random positive semidefinite matrices,
and the (relatively simple) proof uses a variant of the so-called PAC-Bayesian

  We give two applications of the main result. In the first one we obtain a new
finite-sample bound for ordinary least squares estimator in linear regression
with random design. Our result is model-free, requires fairly weak moment
assumptions and is almost optimal. Our second application is to bounding
restricted eigenvalue constants of certain random ensembles with ""heavy tails"".
These constants are important in the analysis of problems in Compressed Sensing

small umber of linear measurements. Our result implies that heavy tails still
allow for the fast recovery rates found in efficient methods such as the LASSO

approximating the solution of surface partial differential equations using bulk

R^{n+1}$ consisting of a union, $\mathcal{T}_h$, of $(n+1)$-simplices. The
finite element approximating space is based on continuous piece-wise linear
finite element functions on $\mathcal{T}_h$. Our first method is a sharp
interface method, \emph{SIF}, which uses the bulk finite element space in an
approximating weak formulation obtained from integration on a polygonal
approximation, $\Gamma_{h}$, of $\Gamma$. The full gradient is used rather than
the projected tangential gradient and it is this which distinguishes \emph{SIF}
from the method of [42]. The second method, \emph{NBM}, is a narrow band method
in which the region of integration is a narrow band of width $O(h)$. \emph{NBM}
is similar to the method of [13]. but again the full gradient is used in the
discrete weak formulation. The a priori error analysis in this paper shows that
the methods are of optimal order in the surface $L^{2}$ and $H^{1}$ norms and
have the advantage that the normal derivative of the discrete solution is small
and converges to zero. Our third method combines bulk finite elements, discrete
sharp interfaces and narrow bands in order to give an unfitted finite element
method for parabolic equations on evolving surfaces. We show that our method is
conservative so that it preserves mass in the case of an advection diffusion
conservation law. Numerical results are given which illustrate the rates of
convergence.

We show that the generators of SU(2,2) for these unitary irreducible

and study higher spin algebras and superalgebras in AdS_5. The higher spin (HS)
algebra of Fradkin-Vasiliev type in AdS_5 is simply the enveloping algebra of
SU(2,2) quotiented by a two-sided ideal (Joseph ideal) which annihilates the
minrep. We show that the Joseph ideal vanishes identically for the

directly to the HS algebra in AdS_5. Furthermore, the enveloping algebras of
the deformations of the minrep define a one parameter family of HS algebras in
AdS_5 for which certain 4d covariant deformations of the Joseph ideal vanish

Longterm Investigations of the Sun (SOLIS) telescope is capable of obtaining

arcsecond spatial resolution and 0.05 Angstrom spectral resolution. This is
achieved by scanning the Sun in declination and building up spectral cubes for
multiple polarization states, utilizing a beamsplitter and two separate 2k x 2k
CCD cameras. As a result, the eastern and western hemispheres of the Sun are
separated in preliminary VSM images by a vertical gap with soft edges and
variable position and width. Prior to the comprehensive analysis presented in
this document, a trial-and-error approach to removing the gap had yielded an
algorithm that was inconsistent, undocumented, and responsible for incorrectly
eliminating too many image columns. Here we describe, in detail, the basis for
a new, streamlined, and properly calibrated prescription for locating and
removing the gap that is correct to within approximately one arcsecond (one

  MHD numerical simulations","to appear in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stt2393",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For the past decade observations of the alignement of PNe symmetries with
respect to the galactic disk have led to conflicting results. Recently
observational evidence for alignment between PNe and local interstellar
magnetic fields in the central part of the Galaxy ($b < 5^\circ$) has been
found. We studied the role of the interstellar magnetic field on the dynamical
evolution of a PN by means of an analytical model and from 3D MHD numerical
simulations. We test under what conditions typical ejecta would have their
dynamics severely modified by an interstellar magnetic field. We found that
uniform fields of $> 100\mu$G are required in order to be dynamically dominant.
This is found to occur only at later evolutionary stages, therefore being
unable to change the general morphology of the nebula. However, the symmetry
axis of bipolar and elliptical nebulae end up aligned to the external field.
This result can explain why different samples of PNe result in different
conclusions regarding the alignment of PNe. Objects located at high galactic
latitudes, or at large radii, should present no preferential alignment with
respect to the galactic plane. PNe located at the galactic centre and low
latitudes would, on the other hand, be preferentiably aligned to the disk.
Finally, we present synthetic polarization maps of the nebulae to show that the
polarization vectors, as well as the field lines at the expanding shell, are
not uniform even in the strongly magnetized case, indicating that polarization
maps of nebulae are not adequate in probing the orientation, or intensity, of
the dominant external field.

find is that roughly equal amounts of radioactive material are found in both
regions. The two-zone analytical model provides a more realistic representation
of the structure of the ejecta, including mixing and asymmetries, which offers
a physical explanation for how the radioactive material is propelled to, and
mixed within, the outer regions. Our result supports the theoretical
expectation that the radioactive content in the outflow of a type Ib supernova
(SN) is thoroughly mixed. We fit our model to six additional SNe Ibc, of which
the majority of the SNe Ib are best described by the two-zone model, and the

of high-energy gamma-ray astronomy. At first, in the 70s, there were only two
identified sources, the Crab and Vela pulsars. However, although few in number,
these objects were crucial in establishing the very concept of a gamma-ray
source. Moreover, they opened up significant discovery space both in the
theoretical and phenomenological fronts. The need to explain the copious
gamma-ray emission of these pulsars led to breakthrough developments in
understanding the structure and physics of neutron star magnetospheres. In
parallel, the 20-year-long chase to understand the nature of Geminga unveiled
the existence of a radio-quiet, gamma-ray-emitting, INS, adding a new dimension
to the INS family. Today we are living through an extraordinary time of
discovery. The current generation of gamma-ray detectors has vastly increased
the population of known of gamma-ray-emitting neutron stars. The 100 mark was
crossed in 2011 and we are now approaching 150. The gamma-ray-emitting neutron
star population exhibits roughly equal numbers of radio-loud and radio-quiet
young INSs, plus an astonishing, and unexpected, group of isolated and binary
millisecond pulsars (MSPs). The number of MSPs is growing so rapidly that they
are on their way to becoming the most numerous members of the family of
gamma-ray-emitting Neutron Stars (NSs) . Even as these findings have set the
stage for a revolution in our understanding of gamma-ray-emitting neutron
stars, long term monitoring of the gamma-ray sky has revealed evidence of flux
variability in the Crab Nebula as well as in the pulsed emission from PSR
J2021+4026, challenging a four-decade-old, constant-emission paradigm. Now we
know that both pulsars and their nebulae can, indeed, display variable
emission.

avoid the use of a variable bias parameter used in previous works, which leads
to the improved hardness thresholds in addition to simplifying the analysis
substantially. Apart from standard techniques from Fourier Analysis, for the

Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) present a unique system where

excitons from different valleys, which are distinct from biexcitons in

intervalley biexcitons in the monolayer TMD MoS2 using ultrafast pump-probe

identify two species of intervalley biexcitons with large binding energies of
60 meV and 40 meV. In addition, we also reveal effects beyond biexcitonic
pairwise interactions in which the exciton energy redshifts at increasing
exciton densities, indicating the presence of many-body interactions among

et al. [9] showed that a query can be computed by a coordination-free
relational transducer network iff it is monotone, thus answering in the
affirmative a variant of Hellerstein's CALM conjecture, based on a particular
definition of coordination-free computation. In this paper, we present three
additional models for declarative networking. In these variants, relational
transducers have limited access to the way data is distributed. This variation
allows transducer networks to compute more queries in a coordination-free
manner: e.g., a transducer can check whether a ground atom $A$ over the input
schema is in the ""scope"" of the local node, and then send either $A$ or $\neg
A$ to other nodes.
  We show the surprising result that the query given by the well-founded
semantics of the unstratifiable win-move program is coordination-free in some
of the models we consider. We also show that the original transducer network
model [9] and our variants form a strict hierarchy of classes of
coordination-free queries. Finally, we identify different syntactic fragments
of Datalog${}^{\neg\neg}_{\forall}$, called semi-monotone programs, which can
be used as declarative network programming languages, whose distributed
computation is guaranteed to be eventually consistent and coordination-free.

particle size-distribution down to sizes of the order of 1 cm (Marouf et al.,
1983), (Zebker et al., 1985). The lack of optical depth variations between
ultraviolet and near-IR wavelengths indicate a lack of micron-sized particles.
Between these two regimes, the particle-size distribution is largely unknown. A
cutoff where the particle-size distribution turns over must exist, but the
position and shape of it is not clear from existing studies.
  Using a series of solar occultations performed by the VIMS instrument
on-board Cassini in the near-infrared, we are able to measure light forward
scattered by particles in the A and C rings. With a model of diffraction by
ring particles, and the previous radio work as a constraint on the slope of the
particle size distribution, we estimate the minimum particle size using a
truncated power-law size distribution. The C Ring shows a minimum particle size
of $4.1^{+3.8}_{-1.3}$ mm, with an assumed power law index of q=3.1 and a
maximum particle size of 10 m.
  The A Ring signal shows a similar level of scattered flux, but modeling is
complicated by the presence of self-gravity wakes and higher optical depths. If
q<3, our A Ring model requires a minimum particle size below one millimeter (<
0.34 mm for an assumed q=2.75, or $0.56^{+0.35}_{-0.16}$ mm for a steeper
q=2.9) to be consistent with VIMS observations. These results might seem to
contradict previous optical(Dones et al., 1993) and infrared (French and
Nicholson, 2000) work, which implied that there were few particles in the A
Ring smaller than 1 cm. But, because of the shallow power law, relatively

artificial media that interact with light in a way unknown from naturally
occurring materials. This is commonly achieved by creating sub-wavelength
lattices of electronic or plasmonic structures, so-called meta-atoms, that
determine the interaction between light and metamaterial. One of the ultimate
goals for these tailored media is the ability to control their properties
in-situ which has led to a whole new branch of tunable and switchable
metamaterials. Many of the present realizations rely on introducing
microelectromechanical actuators or semiconductor elements into their meta-atom
structures. Here we show that superconducting quantum interference devices
(SQUIDs) can be used as fast, intrinsically switchable meta-atoms. We found
that their intrinsic nonlinearity leads to simultaneously stable dynamic
states, each of which is associated with a different value and sign of the
magnetic susceptibility in the microwave domain. Moreover, we demonstrate that
it is possible to switch between these states by applying a nanosecond long
pulse in addition to the microwave probe signal. Apart from potential
applications such as, for example, an all-optical metamaterial switch, these
results suggest that multi-stability, which is a common feature in many
nonlinear systems, can be utilized to create new types of meta-atoms.

related to the divergent thermal conductivity in this model and the exact

in the massless phase, but shows a diffusive behavior at high temperatures in
the easy-axis phase in the case of a vanishing background spin density. We
extract a quantitative estimate for the spin diffusion constant from the time
dependence of the spatial variance of the spin density, which agrees well with
values obtained from current-current correlation functions using an Einstein
relation. As an example for non-integrable models, we consider two-leg ladders,

in this field is that graphs that exhibit heterogeneity in the number of
connections between individuals are more conducive to the spread of cooperative
behaviours. In this article we show that such a conclusion largely depends on
the individual-level interactions that take place. In particular, averaging
payoffs garnered through game interactions rather than accumulating the payoffs
can altogether remove the cooperative advantage of heterogeneous graphs while
such a difference does not affect the outcome on homogeneous structures. In
addition, the rate at which game interactions occur can alter the evolutionary
outcome. Less interactions allow heterogeneous graphs to support more
cooperation than homogeneous graphs, while higher rates of interactions make
homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs virtually indistinguishable in their
ability to support cooperation. Most importantly, we show that common measures
of evolutionary advantage used in homogeneous populations, such as a comparison
of the fixation probability of a rare mutant to that of the resident type, are
no longer valid in heterogeneous populations. Heterogeneity causes a bias in
where mutations occur in the population which affects the mutant's fixation
probability. We derive the appropriate measures for heterogeneous populations
that account for this bias.

the companion Paper II (Crocce et al. 2013). Given its large volume and fine
mass resolution, the MICE-GC simulation also allows an accurate modeling of the
lensing observables from upcoming wide and deep galaxy surveys. In the last
paper of this series (Paper III), we describe the construction of all-sky
lensing maps, following the ""Onion Universe"" approach (Fosalba et al. 2008),
and discuss their properties in the lightcone up to z=1.4 with sub-arcmin
spatial resolution. By comparing the convergence power spectrum in the MICE-GC
to lower mass-resolution (i.e., particle mass ~ 10^11 Msun) simulations, we
find that resolution effects are at the 5 % level for multipoles l ~ 10^3 and
20 % for l ~ 10^4. Resolution effects have a much lower impact on our
simulation, as shown by comparing the MICE-GC to recent numerical fits by
Takahashi et al 2012. We use the all-sky lensing maps to model galaxy lensing
properties, such as the convergence, shear, and lensed magnitudes and
positions, and validate them thoroughly using galaxy shear auto and
cross-correlations in harmonic and configuration space. Our results show that
the galaxy lensing mocks here presented can be used to accurately model lensing
observables down to arcminute scales.

contrast, the spectrum of secondary positrons produced through the collisions
of cosmic rays in the interstellar medium is predicted to fall rapidly with
energy, and thus is unable to account for the observed rise. It has been
proposed, however, that secondary positrons could be produced and then
accelerated in nearby supernova remnants, potentially explaining the observed

are accelerated in such shocks, other secondary cosmic ray species (such as
boron nuclei, and antiprotons) will also be accelerated, leading to rises in
the boron-to-carbon and antiproton-to-proton ratios. The measurements of the
boron-to-carbon ratio by the PAMELA and AMS collaborations, however, show no
sign of such a rise. With this new data in hand, we revisit the secondary

This produces a quasi-thermal radiation bath with a slowly-varying temperature
during inflation and further damps the inflaton's motion, thus prolonging
inflation. As in the standard supercooled scenario, inflation ends when the
waterfall fields become tachyonic and can no longer sustain a nearly constant
vacuum energy, but the interaction with the radiation bath makes the waterfall
fields effectively heavier and delays the phase transition to the
supersymmetric minimum. In this work, we analyze for the first time the effects
of finite temperature corrections and SUSY mass splittings on the quantum
effective potential and the resulting dissipation coefficient. We show, in
particular, that dissipation can significantly delay the onset of the tachyonic
instability to yield 50-60 e-folds of inflation and an observationally
consistent primordial spectrum, which is not possible in the standard
supercooled regime when inflation is driven by radiative corrections.

streamers were seen, indicating the presence of a coronal shock associated with
this CME eruption. The evolution of the CME and an associated EUV wave were
studied using EUV and coronagraph images. It was found that the lateral
expansion of the CME low in the corona closely tracked the propagation of the
EUV wave, with measured velocities of 240+/-19 km/s and 221+/-15 km/s for the
CME and wave respectively. Solar energetic particles were observed arriving
first at STEREO-A, followed by electrons at the Wind spacecraft at L1, then
STEREO-B, and finally protons arriving simultaneously at Wind and STEREO-B. By
carrying out velocity-dispersion analysis on the particles arriving at each
location, it was found that energetic particles arriving at STEREO-A were
released first and the release of particles arriving at STEREO-B was delayed by
around 50 minutes. Analysis of the expansion of the CME to a wider longitude
indicates that this delay is a result of the time taken for the edge of the CME
to reach the footpoints of the magnetic-field lines connected to STEREO-B. The
CME expansion is not seen to reach the magnetic footpoint of Wind at the time
of solar particle release for the particles detected here, suggesting that

represent the QQI. The quadrupoles are built as pairs of electric dipoles and
anti-dipoles orientated perpendicular to the 2D plane to which the gas is

external field, they are polarized by inhomogeneous dc electric field that may
be supplied by a tapered capacitor. Shapes, stability, mobility, and collisions
of fundamental discrete solitons are studied by means of systematic
simulations. In particular, threshold values of the norm, necessary for the
existence of the solitons, are found, and anisotropy of their static and
dynamical properties is explored. As concerns the mobility and collisions, it
is the first analysis of such properties for discrete solitons on 2D lattices

physics can be adapted to provide a machinery for performing Bayesian inference
in function spaces. Such inference comes about naturally in the study of
inverse problems of recovering continuous (infinite dimensional) coefficient
functions from ordinary or partial differential equations (ODE, PDE), a problem
which is typically ill-posed. Regularization of these problems using $L^2$
function spaces (Tikhonov regularization) is equivalent to Bayesian
probabilistic inference, using a Gaussian prior. The Bayesian interpretation of
inverse problem regularization is useful since it allows one to quantify and
characterize error and degree of precision in the solution of inverse problems,
as well as examine assumptions made in solving the problem -- namely whether
the subjective choice of regularization is compatible with prior knowledge.
Using path-integral formalism, Bayesian inference can be explored through
various perturbative techniques, such as the semiclassical approximation, which
we use in this manuscript. Perturbative path-integral approaches, while
offering alternatives to computational approaches like Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo
(MCMC), also provide natural starting points for MCMC methods that can be used
to refine approximations.
  In this manuscript, we illustrate a path-integral formulation for inverse
problems and demonstrate it on an inverse problem in membrane biophysics as
well as inverse problems in potential theories involving the Poisson equation.

Single antenna MDs are randomly distributed on a 2D plane according to a

algorithm to cluster each source with a subset of available relays to form a

hard optimization problem of precoding in our scenario can be approximately
solved by semidefinite relaxation. We investigate a special case with a single

efficiency of the VMIMO system. Then, we propose an optimal greedy algorithm
that achieves this bound. We further exploit these results to obtain a
polynomial time clustering algorithm for the general case with multiple
sources. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to compare the
performance of our algorithm with that of an exhaustive clustering algorithm,

  Analysis and Supervised Learning",,,,,"q-bio.QM cs.LG math.OC q-bio.BM stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Protein contacts contain important information for protein structure and
functional study, but contact prediction from sequence remains very
challenging. Both evolutionary coupling (EC) analysis and supervised machine
learning methods are developed to predict contacts, making use of different
types of information, respectively. This paper presents a group graphical lasso
(GGL) method for contact prediction that integrates joint multi-family EC
analysis and supervised learning. Different from existing single-family EC
analysis that uses residue co-evolution information in only the target protein
family, our joint EC analysis uses residue co-evolution in both the target
family and its related families, which may have divergent sequences but similar
folds. To implement joint EC analysis, we model a set of related protein
families using Gaussian graphical models (GGM) and then co-estimate their
precision matrices by maximum-likelihood, subject to the constraint that the
precision matrices shall share similar residue co-evolution patterns. To
further improve the accuracy of the estimated precision matrices, we employ a
supervised learning method to predict contact probability from a variety of
evolutionary and non-evolutionary information and then incorporate the
predicted probability as prior into our GGL framework. Experiments show that
our method can predict contacts much more accurately than existing methods, and
that our method performs better on both conserved and family-specific contacts.

constrain access to cloud resources by hiding their raw functionality and

  We sketch a self-organizing architecture for very large compute clouds
composed of many-core processors and heterogeneous coprocessors. We discuss how
self-organization will address each of the challenges described above. The
approach is {\em bid-centric}. The system of heterogeneous cloud resources is
dynamically, and autonomically, configured to bid to meet the needs identified
in a high-level task or service specification. When the task is completed, or
the service is retired, the resources are released for subsequent reuse.
  Our approach mimics the process followed by individual researchers who, in
response to a call for proposals released by a funding agency, organize
themselves in groups of various sizes and specialities. If the bid is
successful, then the group carries out the proposed work and releases the
results. After the work is completed, individual researchers in the group
disperse, possibly joining other groups or submitting individual bids in
response to other proposals. Similar protocols are common to other human

spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman fields. In this work, a comprehensive
understanding of the pairing symmetry, phase diagram and the edge modes in this
new topological matter are presented. The momentum of the Cooper pairs plays
the role of renormalizing the in-plane Zeeman field and chemical potential. The
in-plane Zeeman field and finite momentum pairing induce asymmetry to the
effective $p$-wave pairing, apart from a small fraction of higher orbital
components. The phase diagram is composed by different phases, which are
determined by the topology and band gap nature of the superfluids. Especially,
the gapped and gapless topological FFLO phase have totally different finite

distribution} of $f$ to be the distribution on subsets of $[n]$ in which the
set $S$ is sampled with probability $\widehat{f}(S)^2$. Then the Fourier
Entropy-Influence (FEI) conjecture of Friedgut and Kalai (1996) states that
there is some absolute constant $C$ such that $\operatorname{H}[\widehat{f}^2]
\leq C\cdot\operatorname{Inf}[f]$. Here, $\operatorname{H}[\widehat{f}^2]$
denotes the Shannon entropy of $f$'s spectral distribution, and
$\operatorname{Inf}[f]$ is the total influence of $f$. This conjecture is one
of the major open problems in the analysis of Boolean functions, and settling
it would have several interesting consequences.
  Previous results on the FEI conjecture have been largely through direct
calculation. In this paper we study a natural interpretation of the conjecture,
which states that there exists a communication protocol which, given subset $S$
of $[n]$ distributed as $\widehat{f}^2$, can communicate the value of $S$ using
at most $C\cdot\operatorname{Inf}[f]$ bits in expectation.
  Using this interpretation, we are able show the following results:
  1. First, if $f$ is computable by a read-$k$ decision tree, then
$\operatorname{H}[\widehat{f}^2] \leq 9k\cdot \operatorname{Inf}[f]$.
  2. Next, if $f$ has $\operatorname{Inf}[f] \geq 1$ and is computable by a
decision tree with expected depth $d$, then $\operatorname{H}[\widehat{f}^2]
\leq 12d\cdot \operatorname{Inf}[f]$.
  3. Finally, we give a new proof of the main theorem of O'Donnell and Tan
(ICALP 2013), i.e. that their FEI$^+$ conjecture composes.
  In addition, we show that natural improvements to our decision tree results
would be sufficient to prove the FEI conjecture in its entirety. We believe
that our methods give more illuminating proofs than previous results about the
FEI conjecture.

pressure-temperature and molecular abundances profiles for various plausible
internal temperatures of the planet (up to 560 K) and metallicities (from solar
to 100 times solar), using a radiative-convective model and a chemical model
which includes thermochemical kinetics, vertical mixing, and photochemistry. We
find that the CO/CH4 abundance ratio increases with metallicity and tidal
heating, and ranges from 1/20 to 1000 within the ranges of metallicity and
internal temperature explored. Water vapour locks most of the oxygen and
reaches a very high abundance, whatever the metallicity and internal

ultradiscrete periodic Toda lattice (UD-pTL). Time evolution of the UD-pTL is
translated into an addition on the Picard group of its spectral curve, which is
a tropical hyperelliptic curve of arbitrary genus depending on the system size.
The addition on the Picard group can be realized by using intersection of
several tropical plane curves, one of which is the spectral curve. In addition,
the tropical eigenvector map, which maps a point in the phase space of the
UD-pTL into a set of points on the spectral curve, can also be realized by
using intersection of tropical curves. Thus, if the initial values are given
then the time evolution of the UD-pTL is completely translated into a motion of
intersection points of tropical plane curves. Moreover, all tropical plane
curves appearing in the curve intersection are explicitly given in terms of the
conserved quantities of the UD-pTL.

generated subgroup of an almost simple semi-simple group over the rationals is
Zariski-dense. We reduce this question to one of computing Galois groups, and
to this end we describe efficient algorithms to check if the Galois group of a
polynomial $p$ with integer coefficients is ""generic"" (which, for arbitrary
polynomials of degree $n$ means the full symmetric group $S_n,$ while for
reciprocal polynomials of degree $2n$ it means the hyperoctahedral group $C_2

group $S_n,$ and that a reciprocal polynomial has Galois group $C_2 \wr S_n.$
We show how these algorithms give efficient algorithms to check if a set of
matrices $\mathcal{G}$ in $\mathop{SL}(n, \mathbb{Z})$ or $\mathop{Sp}(2n,
\mathbb{Z})$ generate a \emph{Zariski dense} subgroup.
  The complexity of doing this in$\mathop{SL}(n, \mathbb{Z})$ is of order
$O(n^4 \log n \log \|\mathcal{G}\|)\log \epsilon$ and in $\mathop{Sp}(2n,
\mathbb{Z})$ the complexity is of order $O(n^8 \log n\log \|\mathcal{G}\|)\log
\epsilon$ In general semisimple groups we show that Zariski density can be
confirmed or denied in time of order $O(n^14 \log \|\mathcal{G}\|\log
\epsilon),$ where $\epsilon$ is the probability of a wrong ""NO"" answer, while
$\|\mathcal{G}\|$ is the measure of complexity of the input (the maximum of the
Frobenius norms of the generating matrices). The algorithms work essentially
without change over algebraic number fields, and in other semi-simple groups.
However, we restrict to the case of the special linear and symplectic groups
and rational coefficients in the interest of clarity.

releases it via dissipation. However, the quantitative details of this energy
flow have not been assessed for global disk models. In this work we examine the
energetics of a well-resolved, three-dimensional, global magnetohydrodynamic
accretion disk simulation by evaluating statistically-averaged mean-field
equations for magnetic, kinetic, and internal energy using simulation data. The
results reveal that turbulent magnetic (kinetic) energy is primarily injected
by the correlation between Maxwell (Reynolds) stresses and shear in the (almost
Keplerian) mean flow, and removed by dissipation. This finding differs from
previous work using local (shearing-box) models, which indicated that turbulent
kinetic energy was primarily sourced from the magnetic energy reservoir.
Lorentz forces provide the bridge between the magnetic and kinetic energy
reservoirs, converting ~ 1/5 of the total turbulent magnetic power input into
turbulent kinetic energy. The turbulent energies (both magnetic and kinetic)
are mainly driven by terms associated with the turbulent fields, with only a
minor influence from mean magnetic fields. The interaction between mean and
turbulent fields is most evident in the induction equation, with the mean
radial magnetic field being strongly influenced by the turbulent electromotive
force (EMF). During the quasi-steady turbulent state roughly 2/3 of the
Poynting flux travels into the corona, with the remainder transporting magnetic
energy in the radial direction. In contrast to previous studies, the
stress-related part of the Poynting flux is found to dominate, which may have
important implications for ""reflection"" models of Seyfert galaxy coronae that
typically invoke a picture of buoyant rising of magnetic flux tubes via
advection.

structure is solved in distributed fashion using (sub)gradient and recently
also fast gradient methods. The traditional dual decomposition suffers from two
main short-comings. The first is that the convergence is often slow, although
fast gradient methods have significantly improved the situation. The second is
that computation of the optimal step-size requires centralized computations,
which hinders a fully distributed implementation of the algorithm. In this
paper, the first issue is addressed by providing a tighter characterization of
the dual function than what has previously been reported in the literature.
Then a distributed and a parallel algorithm are presented in which the provided
dual function approximation is minimized in each step. Since the approximation
is more accurate than the approximation used in standard and fast dual
decomposition, the convergence properties are improved. For the second issue,
we extend a recent result to allow for a fully distributed parameter selection
in the algorithm. Further, we show how to apply the proposed algorithms to
optimization problems arising in distributed model predictive control (DMPC)
and show that the proposed distributed algorithm enjoys distributed
reconfiguration, i.e. plug-and-play, in the DMPC context.

as fast dual ascent and the alternating direction method of multipliers, for
embedded model predictive control. The main reason is that they can be
implemented using simple arithmetic operations only. However, a known
limitation of gradient-based methods is that they are sensitive to
ill-conditioning of the problem data. In this paper, we present a fast dual
gradient method for which the sensitivity to ill-conditioning is greatly
reduced. This is achieved by approximating the negative dual function with a
quadratic upper bound with different curvature in different directions in the
algorithm, as opposed to having the same curvature in all directions as in
standard fast gradient methods. The main contribution of this paper is a
characterization of the set of matrices that can be used to form such a
quadratic upper bound to the negative dual function. We also describe how to
choose a matrix from this set to get an improved approximation of the dual
function, especially if it is ill-conditioned, compared to the approximation
used in standard fast dual gradient methods. This can give a significantly
improved performance as illustrated by a numerical evaluation on an
ill-conditioned AFTI-16 aircraft model.

cluster parameters with negligible bias. In realistic simulations of an
SPT-like survey, with realizations of cosmic microwave background anisotropy,
point sources, and atmosphere and instrumental noise at typical SPT-SZ survey
levels, we find that YSZ is most accurately determined in an aperture
comparable to the SPT beam size. We demonstrate the utility of this method to
measure YSZ and to constrain mass scaling relations using X-ray mass estimates
for a sample of 18 galaxy clusters from the SPT-SZ survey. Measuring YSZ within
a 0.75' radius aperture, we find an intrinsic log-normal scatter of 21+/-11% in
YSZ at a fixed mass. Measuring YSZ within a 0.3 Mpc projected radius
(equivalent to 0.75' at the survey median redshift z = 0.6), we find a scatter
of 26+/-9%. Prior to this study, the SPT observable found to have the lowest

accrued by social network applications, demand the design of new techniques and
platforms to efficiently derive actionable knowledge from large-scale graphs.
However, real-world graphs are famously difficult to process efficiently. Not
only they have a large memory footprint, but also most graph algorithms entail
memory access patterns with poor locality, data-dependent parallelism and a low
compute-to-memory access ratio. Moreover, most real-world graphs have a highly
heterogeneous node degree distribution, hence partitioning these graphs for
parallel processing and simultaneously achieving access locality and
load-balancing is difficult.
  This work starts from the hypothesis that hybrid platforms (e.g.,
GPU-accelerated systems) have both the potential to cope with the heterogeneous
structure of real graphs and to offer a cost-effective platform for
high-performance graph processing. This work assesses this hypothesis and
presents an extensive exploration of the opportunity to harness hybrid systems
to process large-scale graphs efficiently. In particular, (i) we present a
performance model that estimates the achievable performance on hybrid
platforms; (ii) informed by the performance model, we design and develop TOTEM

algorithms on hybrid platforms; (iii) we show that further performance gains
can be extracted using partitioning strategies that aim to produce partitions
that each matches the strengths of the processing element it is allocated to,
finally, (iv) we demonstrate the performance advantages of the hybrid system
through a comprehensive evaluation that uses real and synthetic workloads (as
large as 16 billion edges), multiple graph algorithms that stress the system in
various ways, and a variety of hardware configurations.

anisotropy represented by the traceless nematic order tensor $Q$ (rigid units),
and the positive definite step-length tensor $L$ (network). This work is
motivated by the study of cytoskeletal networks which can be regarded as
consisting of rigid rod units crosslinked into a polymeric-type network.
  Due to the mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian structure of the energy, it is essential
that the deformation maps $\varphi$ be invertible. We require sufficient
regularity of the fields $(\varphi, Q)$ of the problem, and that the
deformation map satisfies the Ciarlet-Necas condition. These, in turn,
determine what boundary conditions are admissible, which include the case of
Dirichlet conditions on both fields. The approach of including the
Rapini-Papoular surface energy for the pull-back tensor $\tilde Q$ is also
discussed. The regularity requirements lead us to consider powers of the
gradient of the order tensor $Q$ higher than quadratic in the energy.
  We assume polyconvexity of the stored energy function with respect to the
effective deformation tensor and apply methods from isotropic nonlinear
elasticity. We formulate a necessary and sufficient condition to guarantee this
invertibility property in terms of the growth to infinity of the bulk liquid
crystal energy $f(Q)$, as the minimum eigenvalue of $Q$ approaches the singular
limit of $-\frac{1}{3}$. $L$ becomes singular as the minimum eigenvalue of $Q$
reaches $-\frac{1}{3}$. Lower bounds on the eigenvalues of $Q$ are needed to
ensure compatibility between the theories of Landau-de Gennes and Maier-Saupe

sensitivity to parameter values. In the absence of treatment, tumor evolution
is most affected by the intrinsic tumor growth rate and carrying capacity. When
treatment is introduced, tumor growth is most affected by drug-specific PK/PD

Minimum graph bisection, Edge expansion, Sparsest Cut, and Small Set expansion,
as well as the Unique Games problem. These problems are notorious for the
existence of huge gaps between the known algorithmic results and NP-hardness
results. Our algorithm is based on rounding semidefinite programs from the
Lasserre hierarchy, and the analysis uses bounds for low-rank approximations of
a matrix in Frobenius norm using columns of the matrix.
  For all the above graph problems, we give an algorithm running in time
$n^{O(r/\epsilon^2)}$ with approximation ratio
$\frac{1+\epsilon}{\min\{1,\lambda_r\}}$, where $\lambda_r$ is the $r$'th
smallest eigenvalue of the normalized graph Laplacian $\mathcal{L}$. In the
case of graph bisection and small set expansion, the number of vertices in the
cut is within lower-order terms of the stipulated bound. Our results imply
$(1+O(\epsilon))$ factor approximation in time $n^{O(r^\ast/\epsilon^2)}$ where
is the number of eigenvalues of $\mathcal{L}$ smaller than $1-\epsilon$ (for
variants of sparsest cut, $\lambda_{r^\ast} \ge \mathrm{OPT}/\epsilon$ also
suffices, and as $\mathrm{OPT}$ is usually $o(1)$ on interesting instances of
these problems, this requirement on $r^\ast$ is typically weaker). For Unique
Games, we give a factor $(1+\frac{2+\epsilon}{\lambda_r})$ approximation for
minimizing the number of unsatisfied constraints in $n^{O(r/\epsilon)}$ time,
improving upon an earlier bound for solving Unique Games on expanders. We also
give an algorithm for independent sets in graphs that performs well when the
Laplacian does not have too many eigenvalues bigger than $1+o(1)$.

$\sum_{i=1}^N f_i(x_i)$ subject to $\sum_{i=1}^N A_i x_i=c, x_i\in
\mathcal{X}_i$. The algorithm decomposes the original problem into N smaller
subproblems and solves them in parallel at each iteration. This Jacobian-type
algorithm is well suited for distributed computing and is particularly
attractive for solving certain large-scale problems.
  This paper introduces a few novel results. Firstly, it shows that extending
ADMM straightforwardly from the classic Gauss-Seidel setting to the Jacobian
setting, from 2 blocks to N blocks, will preserve convergence if matrices $A_i$
are mutually near-orthogonal and have full column-rank. Secondly, for general
matrices $A_i$, this paper proposes to add proximal terms of different kinds to
the N subproblems so that the subproblems can be solved in flexible and
efficient ways and the algorithm converges globally at a rate of o(1/k).
Thirdly, a simple technique is introduced to improve some existing convergence
rates from O(1/k) to o(1/k).
  In practice, some conditions in our convergence theorems are conservative.
Therefore, we introduce a strategy for dynamically tuning the parameters in the
algorithm, leading to substantial acceleration of the convergence in practice.
Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed
method in comparison with several existing parallel algorithms.

cloud, and report its performance on very large-scale basis pursuit problems

The micromagnetic simulation based method can also be used to obtain
iso--frequency countours of spin waves. Iso--frequency contours are analougous
of the Fermi surfaces and hence, they have the potential to radicalize our

there are very few numerical methods available for the analysis of distributed

a numerical scheme for analyzing the behavior of a SISO linear system with a
single term distributed order differentiator/integrator using an operational

assess the stochastic distributed order system, the existing Monte-Carlo,

be explained by the standard magnetic dipole radiation with a constant braking
torque. However, how and why the torque varies still remains controversial,
which is a major issue in understanding neutron stars. Many pulsars have been
observed with significant long-term changes of their spin-down rates modulated
by quasi-periodic oscillations. Applying the phenomenological model of pulsar
timing noise we developed recently to the observed precise pulsar timing data
of isolated neutron stars, here we show that the observed long-term evolutions
of their spin-down rates and quasi-periodic modulations can be explained by
Hall effects in their crusts. Therefore the evolution of their crustal magnetic
fields, rather than that in their cores, dominates the observed long term
spin-down evolution of these young pulsars. Understanding of the nature of
pulsar timing noise not only reveals the interior physics of neutron stars, but
also allows physical modeling of pulsar spin-down and thus improves the
sensitivity of gravitational wave detections with pulsars.

widely used algorithms in multimedia and computer vision community. Traditional
$k$-means is an iterative algorithm---in each iteration new cluster centers are
computed and each data point is re-assigned to its nearest center. The cluster
re-assignment step becomes prohibitively expensive when the number of data

  In this paper, we propose a novel approximate $k$-means algorithm to greatly
reduce the computational complexity in the assignment step. Our approach is
motivated by the observation that most active points changing their cluster
assignments at each iteration are located on or near cluster boundaries. The
idea is to efficiently identify those active points by pre-assembling the data
into groups of neighboring points using multiple random spatial partition
trees, and to use the neighborhood information to construct a closure for each
cluster, in such a way only a small number of cluster candidates need to be
considered when assigning a data point to its nearest cluster. Using complexity
analysis, image data clustering, and applications to image retrieval, we show
that our approach out-performs state-of-the-art approximate $k$-means

the neighborhood graph and the bridge graph in the best-first strategy. The
success of our approach stems from two factors: the exact nearest neighbor
search over a large number of bridge vectors can be done quickly, and the
reference vectors connected to a bridge (reference) vector near the query are
also likely to be near the query. Experimental results on searching over large

pure Ni remained stable during diffusion annealing, recrystallization and
subsequent grain growth occurred in high purity Ni at the same annealing
conditions. Nevertheless, qualitatively similar ultrafast diffusion rates were
measured in the samples of both purity levels. In high purity Ni, the kinetics
of recrystallization was found to deviate strongly from the predictions of the
Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov theory. Moreover, the ultrafast diffusion paths
withstood the recrystallization process. A model which accounts for solute
redistribution in front of the moving boundary is suggested. Retaining of
deformation-induced ultrafast diffusion paths in recrystallized Ni is explained
by a specific mechanism of enhanced stability of the residual ultrafine grained
fraction against recrystallization.

5.8, 3.4, and 11.9$\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ for $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and

two phase of gas: cold gas ($\sim$10 K) spreads across the whole cloud; warm
gas ($>$20 K) outlines the edge of cloud heated by the W80 H II region. The
kinetic structure of the cloud indicates an expanding shell surrounding the
ionized gas produced by the H II region. There are six discernible regions in
the cloud including the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Islands and Sea, Pelican's
Beak, Hat, and Neck. The areas of $^{13}$CO emission range within 2-10 pc$^2$
with mass of (1-5)$\times10^3 M_\odot$ and line width of a few km s$^{-1}$. The
different line properties and signs of star forming activity indicate they are
in different evolutionary stages. Four filamentary structures with complicated
velocity features are detected along the dark lane in LDN 935. Furthermore, a
total of 611 molecular clumps within the $^{13}$CO tracing cloud are identified
using the ClumpFind algorithm. The properties of the clumps suggest most of the

refractory organic compounds, which have been ignored in previous studies on
this topic. We used the commercial software package HSC Chemistry in order to
compute the condensation sequence and chemical composition of refractory
minerals incorporated into planets. The problem of refractory organic material
is approached with two distinct model calculations: the first considers that
the fraction of atoms used in the formation of organic compounds is removed
from the system (i.e. organic compounds are formed in the gas phase and are
nonreactive); and the second assumes that organic compounds are formed by the
reaction between different compounds that had previously condensed from the gas
phase. Results show that refractory material represents more than 50 wt % of
the mass of solids accreted by the simulated planets, with up to 30 wt % of the
total mass composed of refractory organic compounds. Carbide and silicate
abundances are consistent with C/O and Mg/Si elemental ratios of 0.5 and 1.02
for the Sun. Less than 1 wt % of carbides; pyroxene and olivine in similar
quantities are formed. The model predicts planets that are similar in
composition to those of the Solar system. It also shows that, starting from a
common initial nebula composition, a wide variety of chemically different
planets can form, which means that the differences in planetary compositions
are due to differences in the planetary formation process. We show that a model
in which refractory organic material is absent from the system is more
compatible with observations. The use of a planet formation model is essential
to form a wide diversity of planets in a consistent way.

from $\Gamma $ to the group of continuous automorphisms of a compact abelian
group $X$. By duality, such an action of $\Gamma $ is determined by a module
$M=\widehat{X}$ over the integer group ring $\mathbb{Z}\Gamma $ of $\Gamma $.
The simplest examples of such modules are of the form $M=\mathbb{Z}\Gamma

  In this note we prove the following extensions of results by Hayes
\cite{Hayes} on ergodicity of principal algebraic actions: If $\Gamma $ is a
countably infinite discrete group which is not virtually cyclic, and if
$f\in\mathbb{Z}\Gamma $ satisfies that right multiplication by $f$ on $\ell
^2(\Gamma ,\mathbb{R})$ is injective, then the principal $\Gamma $-action
$\alpha _f$ is ergodic (Theorem \ref{t:ergodic2}). If $\Gamma $ contains a
finitely generated subgroup with a single end (e.g. a finitely generated
amenable subgroup which is not virtually cyclic), or an infinite nonamenable
subgroup with vanishing first $\ell ^2$-Betti number (e.g., an infinite
property $T$ subgroup), the injectivity condition on $f$ can be replaced by the
weaker hypothesis that $f$ is not a right zero-divisor in $\mathbb{Z}\Gamma $
(Theorem \ref{t:ergodic1}). Finally, if $\Gamma $ is torsion-free, not
virtually cyclic, and satisfies Linnell's \textit{analytic zero-divisor

relevant to the modeling of thermoacoustic coupling in reactive flows: a
compact acoustic source, an empirical model for the heat source, and
nonlinearities. This thermo-acoustic system features a complex dynamical
behavior. In order to synthesize accurate time-series, we tackle this problem
from a numerical point-of-view, and start by proposing a dedicated solver
designed for dealing with the underlying stiffness, in particular, the retarded
time and the discontinuity at the location of the heat source. Stability
analysis is performed on the limit of low-amplitude disturbances by means of
the projection method proposed by Jarlebring (2008), which alleviates the
linearization with respect to the retarded time. The results are then compared
to the analytical solution of the undamped system, and to Galerkin projection
methods commonly used in this setting. This analysis provides insight into the
consequences of the various assumptions and simplifications that justify the
use of Galerkin expansions based on the eigenmodes of the unheated resonator.
We illustrate that due to the presence of a discontinuity in the spatial
domain, the eigenmodes in the heated case, predicted by using Galerkin
expansion, show spurious oscillations resulting from the Gibbs phenomenon. By
comparing the modes of the linear to that of the nonlinear regime, we are able
to illustrate the mean-flow modulation and frequency switching. Finally,
time-series in the fully nonlinear regime, where a limit cycle is established,
are analyzed and dominant modes are extracted. The analysis of the saturated
limit cycles shows the presence of higher frequency modes, which are linearly
stable but become significant through nonlinear growth of the signal. This
bimodal effect is not captured when the coupling between different frequencies
is not accounted for.

measured data was achieved. Statistical errors of measured temperature and
density were reduced by a factor of 2 or more, depending on plasma conditions,
and comfortably surpassed the values requested for ITER Core Thomson Scattering
(10% for Te and 5% for ne). Excellent agreement with other diagnostics
(conventional High Resolution Thomson Scattering, ECE, Reflectometer) was
achieved over a wide range of plasma conditions. It was demonstrated that
together with long term reliability and modest access port requirements, LIDAR
can provide measurements of a quality similar to a conventional imaging Thomson
Scattering instrument.

""quantum capacitance"", in the phase diagram of a one-dimensional (1D) ring of
ultrasmall Josephson junctions (JJ) at zero temperature by using path integral
techniques. Our analysis also includes dissipation due to quasiparticle
tunneling and Coulomb interactions through a finite mutual and self
capacitance. The resulting phase diagram has several interesting features: A
finite quantum capacitance can stabilize superconductivity even in the limit of
only a finite mutual-capacitance energy which classically leads to breaking of
phase coherence. In the case of vanishing charging effects, relevant in cold
atom settings where Coulomb interactions are absent, we show analytically that
superfluidity is robust to small quantum finite-size fluctuations and identify
the minimum grain size for phase coherence to exist in the array. We have also
found that the renormalization group results are in some cases very sensitive
to relatively small changes of the instanton fugacity. For instance, a certain
combination of capacitances could lead to a non-monotonic dependence of the
superconductor-insulator transition on the Josephson coupling.

The differential expression of gene
products, in particular that of gene regulators, is underlying sexual
dimorphism. Analyses of sex-biased expression have focused mostly in protein
coding genes. Several lines of evidence indicate that microRNAs, a class of
major gene regulators, are likely to have a significant role in sexual
dimorphism. This role has not been systematically explored so far. Here I study
the sex-biased expression pattern of microRNAs in the model species Drosophila
melanogaster. As with protein coding genes, sex biased microRNAs are associated
with the reproductive function. Strikingly, contrary to protein-coding genes,
male biased microRNAs are enriched in the X chromosome whilst female microRNAs
are mostly autosomal. I propose that the chromosomal distribution is a
consequence of high rates of de novo emergence, and a preference of new
microRNAs to be expressed in the testis. I also suggest that demasculinization
of the X chromosome may not affect microRNAs. Interestingly, female biased
microRNAs are often encoded within protein coding genes that are also expressed
in females. MicroRNAs with sex-biased expression do not preferentially target
sex-biased gene transcripts. These results strongly suggest that the sex-biased
expression of microRNAs is mainly a consequence of high rates of microRNA
emergence in the X (male bias) or hitch-hiked expression by host genes (female
bias).

machinery and aberrations in DNAme patterns occur in many diseases, such as
cancer. Mapping and understanding DNAme profiles offers considerable promise
for reversing the aberrant states. There are several approaches to analyze
DNAme, which vary widely in cost, resolution and coverage. Affinity capture and
high-throughput sequencing of methylated DNA strike a good balance between the
high cost of whole genome bisulphite sequencing (WGBS) and the low coverage of
methylation arrays. However, existing methods cannot adequately differentiate
between hypomethylation patterns and low capture efficiency, and do not offer
flexibility to integrate copy number variation (CNV). Furthermore, no
uncertainty estimates are provided, which may prove useful for combining data
from multiple protocols or propagating into downstream analysis. We propose an
empirical Bayes framework that uses a fully methylated (i.e. SssI treated)
control sample to transform observed read densities into regional methylation
estimates. In our model, inefficient capture can be distinguished from low
methylation levels by means of larger posterior variances. Furthermore, we can
integrate CNV by introducing a multiplicative offset into our Poisson model
framework. Notably, our model offers analytic expressions for the mean and
variance of the methylation level and thus is fast to compute. Our algorithm
outperforms existing approaches in terms of bias, mean-squared error and
coverage probabilities as illustrated on multiple reference datasets. Although
our method provides advantages even without the SssI-control, considerable
improvement is achieved by its incorporation. Our method can be applied to
methylated DNA affinity enrichment assays (e.g MBD-seq, MeDIP-seq) and a
software implementation is available in the Bioconductor Repitools package.

effect of dark matter annihilation (DMA) on the collapse of primordial gas. We
numerically investigate the evolution of the gas as it assembles in a
Population III stellar disk. We find that when DMA effects are neglected, the
disk undergoes multiple fragmentation events beginning at ~ 500 yr after the
appearance of the first protostar. On the other hand, DMA heating and
ionization of the gas speeds the initial collapse of gas to protostellar
densities and also affects the stability of the developing disk against
fragmentation, depending on the DM distribution. We compare the evolution when
we model the DM density with an analytical DM profile which remains centrally
peaked, and when we simulate the DM profile using N-body particles (the 'live'
DM halo). When utilizing the analytical DM profile, DMA suppresses disk
fragmentation for ~ 3500 yr after the first protostar forms, in agreement with
earlier work. However, when using a 'live' DM halo, the central DM density peak
is gradually flattened due to the mutual interaction between the DM and the
rotating gaseous disk, reducing the effects of DMA on the gas, and enabling
secondary protostars of mass ~ 1 M_sol to be formed within ~ 900 yr. These
simulations demonstrate that DMA is ineffective in suppressing gas collapse and
subsequent fragmentation, rendering the formation of long-lived dark stars
unlikely. However, DMA effects may still be significant in the early collapse
and disk formation phase of primordial gas evolution.

variation of the total flux density at 8 GHz on the time scale of one month by
the single-dish monitoring. The total flux density varied by 5.5% in 32 days,
which is comparable to the gamma-ray variability time scale, corresponding to
the variability brightness temperature of $7.0 \times 10^{11}$ K. The source
consists of central and southeastern components on the parsec (pc) scale. The
flux of only the central component decreased in the same way as the total flux
density, indicating that the short-term radio variability, and probably the
gamma-ray emitting region, is associated with this component. From the VLBI
observations we obtained the brightness temperatures of greater than $(5.2 \pm

than 1.7, the variability Doppler factor of 2.2, and the 8 GHz radio power of

jets and creation of high-energy particles are ongoing in the central engine,
and that the apparent very radio-loud feature of the source is due to the
Doppler-boosting effect, resulting in the intrinsic radio loudness to be an
order of magnitude smaller than the observed values. We also conclude that the

spacetime, on the other hand, is transitive under a combination of translations
and proper conformal transformations, which do have a matrix representation.
Such matrix, however, is not by itself a de Sitter generator: it gives rise to
a conformal re-scaling of the metric, a transformation not belonging to the de
Sitter group, and in general not associated with diffeomorphisms in spacetime.
When dealing with variational principles and Noether's theorem in de Sitter

its evaluation from loss vs. frequency maxima. The relaxation is assigned to
local hopping of the off-centered Ti4+ ions in the frozen BTO clusters, whose

intermediate results hidden from the environment in which the function is
evaluated. This can be done using fully homomorphic encryption, Yao's garbled
circuits or secure multiparty computation. Applications are manifold, most
prominently the outsourcing of computations to cloud service providers, where
data is to be manipulated and processed in full confidentiality. Today, one of
the most intensively studied solutions to SFE is fully homomorphic encryption
(FHE). Ever since the first such systems have been discovered in 2009, and
despite much progress, FHE still remains inefficient and difficult to implement
practically. Similar concerns apply to garbled circuits and (generic)
multiparty computation protocols. In this work, we introduce the concept of a
blind Turing-machine, which uses simple homomorphic encryption (an extension of
ElGamal encryption) to process ciphertexts in the way as standard
Turing-machines do, thus achieving computability of any function in total
privacy. Remarkably, this shows that fully homomorphic encryption is indeed an
overly strong primitive to do SFE, as group homomorphic encryption with
equality check is already sufficient. Moreover, the technique is easy to
implement and perhaps opens the door to efficient private computations on

for the wavefunction in quantum cosmology, can be attained by a reduction of
the theory to the sector of true physical degrees of freedom and their
canonical quantization. The resulting physical wavefunction unitarily evolving
in the time variable introduced within this reduction can then be raised to the
level of the cosmological wavefunction in superspace of 3-metrics. We apply
this technique in several simple minisuperspace models and discuss both at
classical and quantum level physical reduction in {\em extrinsic} time -- the
time variable determined in terms of extrinsic curvature. Only this extrinsic
time gauge can be consistently used in vicinity of turning points and bounces
where the scale factor reaches extremum. Since the 3-metric scale factor is
canonically dual to extrinsic time variable, the transition from the physical
wavefunction to the wavefunction in superspace represents a kind of the
generalized Fourier transform. This transformation selects square integrable
solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, which guarantee Hermiticity of
canonical operators of the Dirac quantization scheme. Semiclassically this
means that wavefunctions are represented by oscillating waves in classically
allowed domains of superspace and exponentially fall off in classically
forbidden (underbarrier) regions. This is explicitly demonstrated in flat FRW
model with a scalar field having a constant negative potential and for the case
of phantom scalar field with a positive potential. The FRW model of a scalar
field with a vanishing potential does not lead to selection rules for solutions
of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, but this does not violate Hermiticity
properties, because all these solutions are anyway of plane wave type and
describe cosmological dynamics without turning points and bounces.

display unique quantum coherence effects. We study coherent states (CS) on the
complex Grassmannian $\mathbb G_2^4=U(4)/U(2)^2$, orthonormal basis, $U(4)$
generators and their matrix elements in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space
$\mathcal H_\lambda(\mathbb G_2^4)$ of analytic square-integrable holomorphic
functions on $\mathbb G_2^4$, which carries a unitary irreducible
representation of $U(4)$ with index $\lambda\in\mathbb N$. A many-body
representation of the previous construction is introduced through an oscillator
realization of the $U(4)$ Lie algebra generators in terms of eight boson
operators. This particle picture allows us for a physical interpretation of our
abstract mathematical construction in the BLQH jargon. In particular, the index
$\lambda$ is related to the number of flux quanta bound to a bi-fermion in the
composite fermion picture of Jain for fractions of the filling factor $\nu=2$.
The simpler, and better known, case of spin-$s$ CS on the Riemann-Bloch sphere
$\mathbb{S}^2=U(2)/U(1)^2$ is also treated in parallel, of which Grassmannian
$\mathbb G_2^4$-CS can be regarded as a generalized (matrix) version.

confinement. One is the finite support on $x \in [-L,L]$ and the other one is
on $x \in [0,L]$. Here, we consider real Hermitian potentials and report a
surprising disparate behaviour of these two types of confinements. We prove
that in the first option the symmetric potential enjoys reciprocity of both
reflectivity ($R$) and transmitivity ($T$) and their unitarity. More
interestingly, the asymmetry in $V(x)$ causes non-unitarity ($ R+T\ne 1$) and
the non-reciprocity (reciprocity) of $T (R)$. On the other hand, the second
option of confinement gives rise to an essential non-unitarity even when $V(x)$
is symmetric about a point in $[0,L]$. In the absence of symmetry there occurs
non-reciprocity of both $R$ and $T$.

$\infty$-categories has many desirable properties; for instance, if the
enriching $\infty$-category $\mathcal{V}$ is presentably symmetric monoidal
then $\mathrm{Cat}^\mathcal{V}_\infty$ is as well. These features render the
theory useful even when an $\infty$-category of enriched $\infty$-categories
comes from a model category (as is often the case in examples of interest, e.g.
dg-categories, spectral categories, and $(\infty,n)$-categories). This is
analogous to the advantages of $\infty$-categories over more rigid models such
as simplicial categories - for example, the resulting $\infty$-categories of
functors between enriched $\infty$-categories automatically have the correct
homotopy type.
  We construct the homotopy theory of $\mathcal{V}$-enriched
$\infty$-categories as a certain full subcategory of the $\infty$-category of
""many-object associative algebras"" in $\mathcal{V}$. The latter are defined
using a non-symmetric version of Lurie's $\infty$-operads, and we develop the
basics of this theory, closely following Lurie's treatment of symmetric
$\infty$-operads. While we may regard these ""many-object"" algebras as enriched
$\infty$-categories, we show that it is precisely the full subcategory of
""complete"" objects (in the sense of Rezk, i.e. those whose space of objects is
equivalent to its space of equivalences) which are local with respect to the
class of fully faithful and essentially surjective functors. Lastly, we present
some applications of our theory, most notably the identification of associative
algebras in $\mathcal{V}$ as a coreflective subcategory of pointed
$\mathcal{V}$-enriched $\infty$-categories as well as a proof of a strong

electronic structure calculations at the MP2C level of theory to assess the
interaction between water and graphyne, graphdiyne and graphtriyne pores. The
computed penetration barriers suggest that water transport is unfeasible
through graphyne while being unimpeded for graphtriyne. Nevertheless, for
graphdiyne, which presents a pore size almost matching that of water, a low
barrier is found which in turn disappears if an active hydrogen bond with an
additional water molecule on the opposite side of the opening is taken into
account. These results support the possibility of using graphtriyne as an
efficient membrane for water filtration but, in contrast with previous
determinations, they do not exclude graphdiyne. In fact, the related first
principles penetration barrier leads to water permeation probabilities which
are at least two order of magnitude larger than those estimated by employing
commonly used force fields. A new pair potential for the water--carbon
non-covalent component of the interaction has been built and it is recommended
for molecular dynamics simulation involving graphdiyne and water.

systems, both cuspy and non cuspy, that were highly stable and harboured large
fractions of chaotic orbits. All our models had been obtained through cold
collapses of initially spherical $N$--body systems, a method that necessarily
results in models with strongly radial velocity distributions. Here we
investigate a different method that was reported to yield cuspy triaxial models
with virtually no chaos. We show that such result was probably due to the use
of an inadequate chaos detection technique and that, in fact, models with
significant fractions of chaotic orbits result also from that method. Besides,
starting with one of the models from the first paper in this series, we
obtained three different models by rendering its velocity distribution much
less radially biased (i.e., more isotropic) and by modifying its axial ratios
through adiabatic compression. All three models yielded much higher fractions
of regular orbits than most of those from our previous work. We conclude that
it is possible to obtain stable cuspy triaxial models of stellar systems whose
velocity distribution is more isotropic than that of the models obtained from
cold collapses. Those models still harbour large fractions of chaotic orbits
and, although it is difficult to compare the results from different models, we
can tentatively conclude that chaoticity is reduced by velocity isotropy.

approach to achieve Type-II seesaw dominance in non-supersymmetric $SO(10)$
grand unification where a low mass $Z^{\prime}$ boson and specific patterns of
right-handed neutrino masses are predicted within the accessible energy range
of the Large Hadron Collider. In spite of the high value of the seesaw scale,
$M_{\Delta_L} \simeq 10^8-10^9$ GeV, the model predicts new dominant
contributions to neutrino-less double beta decay in the $W_L-W_L$ channel close
to the current experimental limits via exchanges of heavier singlet fermions
used as essential ingredients of this model even when the light active neutrino
masses are normally hierarchical or invertedly hierarchical. We obtain upper
bounds on the lightest sterile neutrino mass $m_s\lesssim 3.0$ GeV, $2.0$ GeV,
and $0.7$ GeV for normally hierarchical, invertedly hierarchical, and
quasi-degenerate patterns of light neutrino masses, respectively. The
underlying non-unitarity effects lead to lepton flavor violating decay
branching ratios within the reach of ongoing or planned experiments and the
leptonic CP-violation parameter nearly two orders larger than the quark sector.
Some of the predicted values on proton lifetime for $p\to e^+\pi^0$ are found
to be within the currently accessible search limits. Other aspects of model
applications including leptogenesis etc. are briefly indicated.

$\sigma_0/T$ well in line with calculations in a relaxation time approach for
$T_c \! < \! T < \! 2.5 \!\, T_c$ as well as an increase of $\sigma_0$ with
$\mu_q^2/T^2$. Furthermore, the frequency dependence of the electric
conductivity $\sigma(\Omega)$ shows a simple functional form well in line with
results from the Dynamical QuasiParticle Model (DQPM). The spin susceptibility
$\chi_S(T,\mu_q)$ is found to increase with temperature $T$ and to rise $\sim
\mu_q ^2/T^2$, too. The actual values for the magnetic response of the QGP in
the temperature range below 250 MeV show that the QGP should respond
diamagnetically in actual ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions since the
maximal magnetic fields created in these collisions are smaller than $B_c(T)$
which defines a boundary between diamagnetism and paramagnetism.

resilience for combination of locally repairable codes with regenerating codes
is considered. This concatenated coding system is designed to handle two
different types of adversarial errors: the first type includes an adversary

contrast to point-to-point, interference-limited communications considered in

a network with $n_l$ legitimate nodes, $n_e$ eavesdroppers, and path loss
exponent $\alpha\geq 2$. As long as $n_e^2(\log(n_e))^{\gamma}=o(n_l)$, for
some positive $\gamma$, we show one can obtain unbounded secure aggregate rate.
This means zero-cost secure communication, given fixed total power constraint
for the entire network. We achieve this result through (i) the source using
Wyner randomized encoder and a serial (multi-stage) block Markov scheme, to
cooperate with the relays and (ii) the relays acting as a virtual multi-antenna
to apply beamforming against the eavesdroppers. Our simpler parallel
(two-stage) relaying scheme can achieve the same unbounded secure aggregate
rate when
$n_e^{\frac{\alpha}{2}+1}(\log(n_e))^{\gamma+\delta(\frac{\alpha}{2}+1)}=o(n_l)$
holds, for some positive $\gamma,\delta$. Finally, we study the improvement (to
the detriment of legitimate nodes) the eavesdroppers achieve in terms of the
information leakage rate in a large cooperative network in case of collusion.
We show that again the zero-cost secure communication is possible, if
$n_e^{(2+\frac{2}{\alpha})}(\log n_e)^{\gamma}=o(n_l)$ holds, for some positive
$\gamma$; i.e., in case of collusion slightly fewer eavesdroppers can be
tolerated compared to the non-colluding case.

Mean regional retinal thickness of 11 retinal layers were obtained by automatic

observed in nasal to the fovea of layer 1 (P<0.001) and in a circular pattern

of layer 6 (P<0.001). Temporal and inferior quadrants of the total retinal

mutations in their sperm than younger males carry. These mutations are not
visible to females choosing mates. Germ-line mutations could oppose preferences
for ""good genes."" Choosy females run the risk that offspring of older males
will be no more attractive or healthy than offspring of younger males.
Germ-line mutations could pose a particular problem when females can only judge
male trait size, rather than assessing age directly. I ask whether or not
females will prefer extreme traits, despite reduced offspring survival due to
age-dependent mutation. I use a quantitative genetic model to examine the
evolution of female preferences, an age-dependent male trait, and overall
health (""condition""). My dynamical equation includes mutation bias that depends
on the generation time of the population. I focus on the case where females
form preferences for older males because male trait size depends on male age.
My findings agree with good genes theory. Females at equilibrium always select
above-average males. The trait size preferred by females directly correlates
with the direct costs of the preference. Direct costs can accentuate the
equilibrium preference at a higher rate than mutational parameters. Females can
always offset direct costs by mating with older, more ornamented males.
Age-dependent mutation in condition maintains genetic variation in condition
and thereby maintains the selective value of female preferences. Rather than
eliminating female preferences, germ-line mutations provide an essential
ingredient in sexual selection.

emission line ratios in their broad and narrow line regions (BLRs and NLRs),
provides invaluable information about the physical connection between the
different components of AGNs. From the archival databases of the International
Ultraviolet Explorer, the Hubble Space Telescope and the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey, we have assembled the largest sample available of AGNs which have
adequate spectra in both the optical and ultraviolet bands to measure the
narrow line ratio [N II]/H{\alpha} and also, in the same objects, the
broad-line N V/C IV ratio. These permit the measurement of the metallicities in
the NLRs and BLRs in the same objects. We find that neither the BLR nor the NLR
metallicity correlate with black hole masses or Eddington ratios, but there is
a strong correlation between NLR and BLR metallicities. This metallicity
correlation implies that outflows from BLRs carry metal-rich gas to NLRs at
characteristic radial distances of ~ 1.0 kiloparsec. This chemical connection
provides evidence for a kinetic feedback of the outflows to their hosts. Metals
transported into the NLR enhance the cooling of the ISM in this region, leading
to local star formation after the AGNs turn to narrow line LINERs. This
post-AGN star formation is predicted to be observable as an excess continuum
emission from the host galaxies in the near infrared and ultraviolet, which
needs to be further explored.

are rooted in the difficulties of abstract thinking and they can cause the
decrease of programming self-concept and other learning motives. We redesigned
the traditional learning environment. As a constructive approach project method
was used. Our students worked in groups of two or three; small problems were
solved after every lesson. In the problem solving process students use
programmable robots (e.g. Surveyor, LEGO NXT and RCX). They had to plan their
program, solve some technical problems and test their solution. The usability
of mobile robots in the learning process and the short-term efficiency of our
teaching method were checked with a control group after a semester (n = 149).
We examined the effects on our students' programming skills and on their
motives, mainly on their attitudes and programming self-concept. After a
two-year-long period we could measure some positive long-term effects.

observational support for the ""maintenance mode"" of feedback is strong (caveat
the details); AGN at the centre of massive halos appear to be regulating the
cooling of hot gas, which could in turn control the levels of future star
formation (SF) and black hole growth. In contrast, direct observational support
for more rapid forms of feedback, which dramatically impact on SF (i.e., the
""quasar mode""), remains elusive. From a systematic study of the spectra of
approx. 24000 z<0.4 AGN we find that extreme ionised gas kinematics are common,
and are most prevalent in radio bright AGN (L[1.4GHz] >10^23 W/Hz). Follow-up
IFU observations have shown that these extreme gas kinematics are extended over
kilo-parsec scales. However, the co-existence of high-levels of SF, luminous
AGN activity and radio jets raises interesting questions on the primary drivers
and impact of these outflows. Galaxy-wide, high-mass outflows are being
observed in an increasing number of AGN and are a plausible mechanism for the
depletion of gas; however, there is still much work to be done to determine the
physical processes that drive these outflows and to measure the level of impact
that they have on their host galaxies.

configuration in the central region along its disk, we present high-resolution
Faraday-corrected polarization data. Radio continuum observations of NGC 4631
at 4.85 GHz were performed with the VLA. In addition, observations were made
with the Effelsberg telescope at 4.85 GHz and at 8.35 GHz. These were analyzed
together with archival VLA-data at 8.35 GHz. The vertical scale heights in NGC
4631 vary significantly in different regions within the galaxy and their mean
values at 4.85 GHz are with 2.3 kpc (370 pc) for the thick (thin) disk higher
than the mean values found so far in six other edge-on spiral galaxies. This
may originate in the tidal interaction of NGC 4631 with its neighbouring
galaxies. The total field strengths in the halo are of the order of the total
magnetic field strength in the disk, whereas the ordered field strengths in the
halo seem to be higher than the value in the disk. The derived distribution of
rotation measures implies that NGC 4631 has a large-scale regular magnetic
field configuration. Despite the strong Faraday depolarization along the
galactic plane and the strong beam depolarization in the transition zone
between the disk and halo, our research strongly indicates that the magnetic
field orientation along the central 5-7 kpc of the disk is also plane-parallel.
Therefore, we claim that NGC 4631 also has a magnetic field structure
plane-parallel along its entire disk.

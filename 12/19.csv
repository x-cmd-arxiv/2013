pure infiniteness of reduced crossed products of $C^*$-algebras $A$ that are
not $G$-simple. In the case $A=\mathrm{C}_0(X)$ the notion of a $G$-separating

communication on any \emph{link} suffers from \emph{additive interference}
caused due to the communication by other agents following their own consensus
protocol. Additionally, no agent knows how many or which agents are interfering
with its communication. Clearly, the standard consensus protocol does not
remain applicable in such scenarios. In this paper, we cast an algebraic
structure over the interference and show that the standard protocol can be
modified such that the average is reachable in a subspace whose dimension is
complimentary to the maximal dimension of the interference subspaces (over all
of the communication links). To develop the results, we use \emph{information
alignment} to align the intended transmission (over each link) to the
null-space of the interference (on that link). We show that this alignment is
indeed invertible, i.e. the intended transmission can be recovered over which,
subsequently, consensus protocol is implemented. That \emph{local} protocols
exist even when the collection of the interference subspaces span the entire
vector space is somewhat surprising.

Here we construct a simplified cell cycle model for a budding yeast to
investigate the underlying mechanism that ensures robustness in this process
containing sequential tasks (DNA replication and mitosis). We first establish a
three-variable model and select a parameter set that qualitatively describes
the yeast cell cycle process. Then, through nonlinear dynamic analysis, we
demonstrate that the yeast cell cycle process is an excitable system driven by
a sequence of saddle-node bifurcations with ghost effects. We further show that
the yeast cell cycle trajectory is globally attractive with modularity in both
state and parameter space, while the convergent manifold provides a suitable
control state for cell cycle checkpoints. These results not only highlight a
regulatory mechanism for executing successive cell cycle processes, but also
provide a possible strategy for the synthetic network design of sequential-task

Among other results, we show that a minimum-cost measurement for a set of given
pure states is formally equivalent to a minimum-error measurement for mixed
states of those same pure states. For pure symmetric states it turns out that
for a certain class of cost matrices, the minimum-cost measurement is the
square-root measurement. That is, the optimal minimum-cost measurement is in
this case the same as the minimum-error measurement. Finally, we consider
sequences of individual ``local"" systems, and examine when the global
minimum-cost measurement is a sequence of optimal local measurements. We also
consider an example where the global minimum-cost measurement is, perhaps
counter-intuitively, not a sequence of local measurements, and discuss how this
is related to related to the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph argument for the nature of

  loops",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Basal Ganglia is a central structure involved in multiple cortical and
subcortical loops. Some of these loops are believed to be responsible for
saccade target selection. We study here how the very specific structural
relationships of these saccadic loops can affect the ability of learning
spatial and feature-based tasks.
  We propose a model of saccade generation with reinforcement learning
capabilities based on our previous basal ganglia and superior colliculus
models. It is structured around the interactions of two parallel cortico-basal
loops and one tecto-basal loop. The two cortical loops separately deal with
spatial and non-spatial information to select targets in a concurrent way. The
subcortical loop is used to make the final target selection leading to the
production of the saccade. These different loops may work in concert or disturb
each other regarding reward maximization. Interactions between these loops and
their learning capabilities are tested on different saccade tasks.
  The results show the ability of this model to correctly learn basic target
selection based on different criteria (spatial or not). Moreover the model
reproduces and explains training dependent express saccades toward targets
based on a spatial criterion.
  Finally, the model predicts that in absence of prefrontal control, the
spatial loop should dominate.

consider the scaling of the logical error rate of the toric code and
demonstrate how, in turn, this may be used to calculate a key performance

the logical error rate and find two distinct operating regimes. The first
regime admits a universal scaling analysis due to a mapping to a statistical
physics model. The second regime characterizes the behavior in the limit of
small physical error rate and can be understood by counting the error
configurations leading to the failure of the decoder. We present a conjecture
for the ranges of validity of these two regimes and use them to quantify the

much smaller than the others, play a special role in constraining the physics
of inflation. Anisotropic sources such as a vector field during inflation
generate distinct angular dependence in all these correlators. In this paper we
focus on the four-point correlator (the trispectrum $T$). We adopt a
parametrization motivated by models in which the inflaton $\phi$ is coupled to
a vector field through a $I^2 \left( \phi \right) F^2$ interaction, namely
$T_{\zeta}({\bf k}_1, {\bf k}_2, {\bf k}_3, {\bf k}_4) \equiv \sum_n d_n [
P_n(\hat{\bf k}_1 \cdot \hat{\bf k}_3) + P_n(\hat{\bf k}_1 \cdot \hat{\bf

P_{\zeta}(k_3) P_\zeta(k_{12}) + (23~{\rm perm})$, where $P_n$ denotes the
Legendre polynomials. This shape is enhanced when the wavenumbers of the
diagonals of the quadrilateral are much smaller than the sides, ${\bf k}_i$.
The coefficient of the isotropic part, $d_0$, is equal to $\tau_{\rm NL}/6$
discussed in the literature. A $I^2 \left( \phi \right) F^2$ interaction
generates $d_2 = 2 d_0$ which is, in turn, related to the quadrupole modulation
parameter of the power spectrum, $g_*$, as $d_2 \approx 14 |g_*| N^2$ with $N
\approx 60$. We show that $d_0$ and $d_2$ can be equally well-constrained: the
expected $68 \%$ CL error bars on these coefficients from a
cosmic-variance-limited experiment measuring temperature anisotropy of the
cosmic microwave background up to $\ell_{\rm max}=2000$ are $\delta d_2 \approx
4 \delta d_0 = 105$. Therefore, we can reach $|g_*|=10^{-3}$ by measuring the
angle-dependent trispectrum. The current upper limit on $\tau_{\rm NL}$ from
the ${\it Planck}$ temperature maps yields $|g_*|<0.02$ ($95 \%$ CL).

However, they conjectured that this is feasible for small parameters only. In

related and recovers the elements by which the protected features, e.g., the
biometric templates, differ. Our theoretical and empirical analysis
demonstrates that the attack is very effective and efficient for practical
parameters. Furthermore, we show how this attack can be extended to fully
recover both feature sets from related vault records much more efficiently than
possible by attacking each record individually. We complement this work by
deriving lower bounds for record multiplicity attacks and use these to show
that our attack is asymptotically optimal in an information theoretic sense.

problem with many applications in inference from linear constraints, but the
performances of sampling algorithms can be affected by ill-conditioning. This
is the case of inferring the feasible steady states in models of metabolic
networks, since they can show heterogeneous time scales . In this work we focus
on rounding procedures based on building an ellipsoid that closely matches the
sampling space, that can be used to define an efficient hit-and-run (HR) Markov
Chain Monte Carlo. In this way the uniformity of the sampling of the convex
space of interest is rigorously guaranteed, at odds with non markovian methods.
We analyze and compare three rounding methods in order to sample the feasible
steady states of metabolic networks of three models of growing size up to
genomic scale. The first is based on principal component analysis (PCA), the
second on linear programming (LP) and finally we employ the lovasz ellipsoid
method (LEM). Our results show that a rounding procedure is mandatory for the
application of the HR in these inference problem and suggest that a combination
of LEM or LP with a subsequent PCA perform the best. We finally compare the
distributions of the HR with that of two heuristics based on the Artificially
Centered hit-and-run (ACHR), gpSampler and optGpSampler. They show a good
agreement with the results of the HR for the small network, while on genome
scale models present inconsistencies.

and baryogenesis. We consider here a string-inspired scenario, in which the
CPTV is associated with a cosmological background with torsion provided by the
Kalb-Ramond (KR) antisymemtric tensor field of the string gravitational
multiplet. In a four-dimensional space time this field is dual to a
pseudoscalar ``axion-like'' field. The mixing of the KR field with an ordinary
axion field can lead to the generation of a Majorana neutrino mass.

and exploit the complex and varying environment. Animals usually exhibit varied
and complicated movements, from apparently deterministic behaviors to highly
random ones. This is critical for assessing movement efficiency and strategies
that are used to quantify and analyze movement trajectories. Here we introduce
a tortuosity entropy (TorEn) based on comparison of parameters, e.g. heading,
bearing, speed, of consecutive points in movement trajectory, which is a simple
measure for quantifying the behavioral change in animal movement data in a fine
scale. In our approach, the differences between pairwise successive track
points are transformed inot symbolic sequences, then we map these symbols into
a group of pattern vectors and calculate the information entropy of pattern
vector. Tortuosity entropy can be easily applied to arbitrary real-world
data-deterministic or stochastic, stationary or non-stationary. We test the
algorithm on both simulated trajectories and real trajectories and show that
both mixed segments in synthetic data and different phases in real movement
data are identified accurately. The results show that the algorithm is
applicable to various situations, indicating that our approach is a promising
tool to reveal the behavioral pattern in movement data.

bursts. Traditionally, their decay is modeled with an exponential function.
However, this is not what theory predicts. The expected functional form for
luminosities below the Eddington limit, at times when there is no significant
nuclear burning, is a power law. We tested the exponential and power-law
functional forms against the best data available: bursts measured with the
high-throughput Proportional Counter Array (PCA) on board the Rossi X-ray
Timing Explorer. We selected a sample of 35 'clean' and ordinary (i.e., shorter
than a few minutes) bursts from 14 different neutron stars that 1) show a large
dynamic range in luminosity, 2) are the least affected by disturbances by the
accretion disk and 3) lack prolonged nuclear burning through the rp-process. We
find indeed that for every burst a power law is a better description than an
exponential function. We also find that the decay index is steep, 1.8 on
average, and different for every burst. This may be explained by contributions
from degenerate electrons and photons to the specific heat capacity of the
ignited layer and by deviations from the Stefan-Boltzmann law due to changes in
the opacity with density and temperature. Detailed verification of this
explanation yields inconclusive results. While the values for the decay index
are consistent, changes of it with the burst time scale, as a proxy of ignition
depth, and with time are not supported by model calculations.

reveal a preference for different environments. The dominant absorption feature
in OH+ arises from a main component seen in CH+ (that with the highest CH+/CH
column density ratio), while OH follows CN absorption. This distinction
provides new constraints on OH chemistry in these clouds. Since CH+ detections
favor low-density gas with small fractions of molecular hydrogen, this must be
true for OH+ as well, confirming OH+ and H2O+ observations with the Herschel
Space Telescope. Our observed correspondence indicates that the cosmic ray
ionization rate derived from these measurements pertains to mainly atomic gas.
The association of OH absorption with gas rich in CN is attributed to the need
for high enough density and molecular fraction before detectable amounts are
seen. Thus, while OH+ leads to OH production, chemical arguments suggest that
their abundances are controlled by different sets of conditions and that they
coexist with different sets of observed species. Of particular note is that
non-thermal chemistry appears to play a limited role in the synthesis of OH in

While for $B=B_c$ the fermion can be considered as a free particle without
defined chirality, for $B<B_c$ ($B>B_c$) the chirality is left (right) and
there exist a net potential acting on the fermion. For the three regimes
defined in the quantum phase transition of chirality, we observe that the
energy spectra for each regime is drastically different. Then, we consider the
$z$-component of the orbital angular momentum as an order parameter that
characterizes the quantum phase transition.

of the spectra of their component stars extremely difficult. For this reason
there exists very little information on the photospheric chemical composition

understanding of the evolutionary processes of stars. In a long-term
observational project we aim to fill this gap with systematic abundance studies
for the variety of binary systems. The core of our analysis is the spectral
disentangling technique, which allows isolation of the individual component
star spectra from the time-series of observed spectra.
  We present new results for high-mass stars in close binaries. So far, we have
measured detailed abundances for 22 stars in a dozen detached binary systems.
The parameter space for the stars in our sample comprises masses in the range
8--22 M_sun, surface gravities of 3.1--4.2 (c.g.s.) and projected rotational
velocities of 30--240 km/s. Whilst recent evolutionary models for rotating
single stars predict changes in photospheric abundances even during the main
sequence lifetime, no star in our sample shows signs of these predicted
changes. It is clear that other effects prevail in the chemical evolution of

Caraguejo Nebula, in which the material expansion was caused by the explosion
of a supernova about 1000 years ago. This instability occurs at the boundary
between two fluids of different densities when one of the fluids accelerated
with respect to the other. In order to study this instability, we performed a
simulation with the code ATHENA Eulerian mesh. For this simulation, we consider
a square domain with periodic boundaries on the sides, and reflecting on the
boundary of the top and bottom. The upper box is filled with a gas density
{\rho}=1.0, pressure P1 = 1.0, adiabatic index {\gamma}=5/3, and velocity
u1=0.03 in the x direction (to the right). The lower portion has a density
{\rho}=2.0, the same pressure, velocity, and adiabatic index, only in the
opposite direction to the left. Speed is defined as a sinusoidal function,
which creates the initial disturbance. As a result, we observe the principle of
instability and the formation of vortices, with well-defined ridges. The
distinctness of the boundary between the material of high and low density is
well preserved due to the relatively low diffusion algorithm. We also note that
the simulation evolving vortices formed from the turmoil merge.

Recent discoveries of variable L/T transition dwarfs argued for patchy clouds

frequency and level of spectral variability in brown dwarfs and to search for
correlations with spectral type. We used HST/WFC3 to obtain spectroscopic time
series for 22 brown dwarfs of spectral types ranging from L5 to T6 at 1.1-1.7
$\mu$m for $\approx$40 min per object. Using Bayesian analysis, we find 6 brown
dwarfs with confident $(p>95\%)$ variability in the relative flux in at least
one wavelength region at sub-percent precision, and 5 brown dwarfs with
tentative $(p>68\%)$ variability. We derive a minimum variability fraction
$f_{min}=27^{+11}_{-7}\%$ over all covered spectral types. The fraction of
variables is equal within errors for mid L, late L and mid T spectral types;
for early T dwarfs we do not find any confident variable but the sample is too
small to derive meaningful limits. For some objects, the variability occurs
primarily in the flux peak in the J or H band, others are variable throughout
the spectrum or only in specific absorption regions. Four sources may have
broad-band peak-to-peak amplitudes exceeding 1%. Our measurements are not
sensitive to very long periods, inclinations near pole-on and rotationally
symmetric heterogeneity. The detection statistics are consistent with most
brown dwarf photospheres being patchy. While multiple-percent near-infrared
variability may be rare and confined to the L/T transition, low-level
heterogeneities are a frequent characteristic of brown dwarf atmospheres.

small crystal dimensions, never exceeding 0.5 micron in diameter, the

significant (c. 20%) richterite components in solid-solution. The occurrence of
fibrous tremolite in an inhabited place, occurring as natural geological

network histogram is obtained by fitting a stochastic blockmodel to a single

bins, and community sizes that of histogram bandwidths or bin sizes. Just as
standard histograms allow for varying bandwidths, different blockmodel
estimates can all be considered valid representations of an underlying
probability model, subject to bandwidth constraints. Here we provide methods
for automatic bandwidth selection, by which the network histogram approximates
the generating mechanism that gives rise to exchangeable random graphs. This
makes the blockmodel a universal network representation for unlabeled graphs.
With this insight, we discuss the interpretation of network communities in
light of the fact that many different community assignments can all give an
equally valid representation of such a network. To demonstrate the
fidelity-versus-interpretability tradeoff inherent in considering different
numbers and sizes of communities, we analyze two publicly available networks -
political weblogs and student friendships - and discuss how to interpret the

The trispectra induced by magnetic energy density and by magnetic scalar
anisotropic stress are found to have typical magnitudes of approximately

trispectrum is also calculated in the flat-sky approximation and yields a

expected capabilities of upcoming large structure surveys. It is typically
found that there will be many well-constrained degrees of freedom. However, not
all and, probably most, of these degrees of freedom were physical if the
parametrization had allowed for an arbitrary $k$-dependence. In this paper, we
restrict the $k$-dependence to that allowed in local theories of gravity under
the quasi-static approximation, i.e. ratios of polynomials in $k$, and identify
the best constrained features in the ($z$,$k$)-dependence of the commonly
considered functions $\mu$ and $\gamma$ as measured by an LSST-like weak
lensing survey. We estimate the uncertainty in the measurements of the
eigenmodes of modified growth. We find that imposing the theoretical prior on
$k$-dependence reduces the number of degrees of freedom and the covariance
between parameters. On the other hand, imaging surveys like LSST are not as
sensitive to the $z$-dependence as they are to the $k$-dependence of the
modified growth functions. This trade off provides us with, more or less, the
same number of well-constrained eigenmodes (with respect to our prior) as found
before, but now these modes are physical.

cataclysmic encounter between a star and the supermassive black hole (SMBH) of
a galaxy, approximately half of the original stellar debris falls back onto the
hole at a rate that can initially exceed the Eddington limit by orders of
magnitude. We argue that the angular momentum of this matter is too low to
allow it to attain a disk-like configuration with accretion proceeding at a
mildly super-Eddington rate, the excess energy being carried away by a
combination of radiative losses and radially distributed winds. Instead, we
propose that the infalling gas traps accretion energy until it inflates into a
weakly-bound, quasi-spherical structure with gas extending nearly to the poles.
We study the structure and evolution of such ""Zero-Bernoulli accretion"" flows
(ZEBRAs) as a model for the super-Eddington phase of TDEs. We argue that such
flows cannot stop extremely super-Eddington accretion from occurring, and that
once the envelope is maximally inflated, any excess accretion energy escapes
through the poles in the form of powerful jets. We compare the predictions of
our model to Swift J1644+57, the putative super-Eddington TDE, and show that it
can qualitatively reproduce some of its observed features. Similar models,
including self-gravity, could be applicable to gamma-ray bursts from collapsars

SHARDS provides medium band photometry equivalent to low-resolution optical
spectra (R~50), allowing us to obtain extremely accurate photometric redshifts
(|Dz|/(1+z)~0.55%) and to improve the constraints on the age distribution of
the stellar populations. A strong correlation is found between the age
difference of central and satellite galaxy and stellar mass ratio, from
negligible age differences in major mergers to age differences ~4 Gyr for 1:100
minor mergers. However, this correlation is simply a reflection of the mass-age
trend in the general population. The dominant contributor to the growth of
massive galaxies corresponds to mass ratios mu=Msat/Mcen>0.3, followed by a
decrease in the fractional mass growth rate linearly proportional to log mu, at
least down to mu~0.01, suggesting a decreasing role of mergers involving
low-mass satellites, especially if dynamical friction timescales are taken into
account. A simple model results in an upper limit for the average mass growth
rate of massive galaxies of DM/M/Dt~ 0.08+-0.02 per Gyr, over the z<1 range,
with a ~70% fractional contribution from (major) mergers with mu>0.3. The
majority of the stellar mass contributed by mergers does not introduce
significantly younger populations, in agreement with the small radial age
gradients observed in present-day early-type galaxies.

devices prepared on thin Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ flakes exfoliated from bulk single
crystals that were grown by a floating zone method. Two types of devices with
their electrical transport properties dominated by $c$-axis transport in Type A
or that of the in-plane in Type B devices, were prepared. Bulk physical
phenomena, including a magnetic transition near 56 K, a structural and
metal-insulator transition at a slightly lower temperature, as well as the
emergence of a highly unusual metallic state as the temperature is further
lowered, were found in both types of devices. However, the Shubnikov-de Haas
oscillations were found in Type A but not Type B devices, most likely due to
enhanced disorder on the flake surface. Finally, the ionic liquid gating of a
Type B device revealed a shift in critical temperature of the structural and
metal-insulator transitions, suggesting that such transitions can be tuned by
the electric field effect.

spectrum is extremely sensitive to the abundance of galaxy clusters and
therefore to fundamental cosmological parameters that control their growth,
such as sigma_8 and Omega_m. Here we explore the sensitivity of the tSZ power
spectrum to important non-gravitational ('sub-grid') physics by employing the
cosmo-OWLS suite of large-volume cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, run
in both the Planck and WMAP7 best-fit cosmologies. On intermediate and small
angular scales (ell > ~1000, or theta < ~10 arcmin), accessible with the South
Pole Telescope and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, the predicted tSZ power
spectrum is highly model dependent, with AGN feedback having a particularly
large effect. However, at large scales, observable with the Planck telescope,
the effects of sub-grid physics are minor. Comparing the simulations with
observations, we find a significant amplitude offset on all measured angular
scales (including large scales), if the Planck best-fit cosmology is assumed by
the simulations. This is shown to be a generic result for all current tSZ
models. By contrast, if the WMAP7 cosmology is adopted, there is full
consistency with the Planck power spectrum measurements on large scales and
agreement at the 2 sigma level with the SPT/ACT measurements at intermediate
scales for our fiducial AGN model, which Le Brun et al. (2014) have shown
reproduces the 'resolved' properties of the local cluster population remarkably
well. These findings strongly suggest that there are significantly fewer
massive galaxy clusters than expected for the Planck best-fit cosmology, which
is consistent with recent measurements of the tSZ number counts. Our findings
therefore pose a significant challenge to the cosmological parameter values
preferred (and/or the model adopted) by the Planck primary CMB analyses.

immersed in hydrochloric acid to convert the films to germanane. Auger electron

the underlying Ge(111) substrate. X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy
indicate that the resulting films are indeed germanane. Ex situ atomic force
microscopy (AFM) shows that the grain size of the germanane is on the order of
a few micrometers, being primarily limited by terraces induced by the miscut of
the Ge substrate. Thus, optimization of the substrate could lead to the

Here we present a statistical approach which attempts to overcome this by
fitting parametric models directly to image data. Specifically, we fit a model
for the radio luminosity function (LF) of star-forming galaxies to pixel
intensity distributions at 1.4 GHz coincident with near-IR selected sources in
COSMOS. Taking a mass-limited sample in redshift bins across the range $0<z<4$
we are able to fit the radio LF with ~0.2 dex precision in the key parameters
(e.g. Phi*,L*). Good agreement is seen between our results and those using
standard methods at radio and other wavelengths. Integrating our luminosity
functions to get the star formation rate density we find that galaxies with a
stellar mass greater than $10^{9.5}\,$M$_{\odot}$ contribute at least 50 per
cent of cosmic star formation at since $z=4$. The scalability of our approach
is empirically estimated, with the precision in LF parameter estimates found to
scale with the number of sources in the stack as $\sqrt{N}$. This type of

$\Phi^n$ is the ideal of morphisms that factor through a projective module. If
R is a right coherent ring and every cotorsion left R-module has a coresolution

The volume reduction (or volume independence) means that the theory defined on
an arbitrarily small lattice is equivalent in the large-$N$ limit to the theory
on an infinite lattice with the same bare parameters. We analyze the volume
reduction by means of Monte Carlo simulations using the lattice model on a
single site (or a small fixed number of sites) with Wilson fermions in the
adjoint representation, using $N$ up to 60. Most of the results focus on two
flavours of Dirac fermions and the single fermionic flavour is also discussed
where there is a significant difference of behaviour. We find that the
$(Z_N)^4$ center symmetry, necessary for the realization of volume reduction,
is unbroken in the reduced model for a large range of parameters and, in
particular, that the maximum admissible value of the adjoint fermion mass is
non-zero in the large-$N$ limit. We calculate physical quantities, such as the
plaquette, the static quark potential and the eigenvalues of the Dirac
operator. We analyze the finite-$N$ corrections and consider the practicality

Here we introduce a new class of active matter, living liquid crystals (LLCs)

physical properties of LLCs can be controlled by the amount of oxygen available
to bacteria, by concentration of ingredients, or by temperature. Our studies
reveal a wealth of new intriguing dynamic phenomena, caused by the coupling
between the activity-triggered flow and long-range orientational order of the
medium. Among these are (a) non-linear trajectories of bacterial motion guided
by non-uniform director, (b) local melting of the liquid crystal caused by the
bacteria-produced shear flows, (c) activity-triggered transition from a
non-flowing uniform state into a flowing one-dimensional periodic pattern and
its evolution into a turbulent array of topological defects, (d)
birefringence-enabled visualization of microflow generated by the
nanometers-thick bacterial flagella. Unlike their isotropic counterpart, the
LLCs show collective dynamic effects at very low volume fraction of bacteria,

inclusion of the out-of-plane magnetic (guide) field. In particular, magnetic
reconnection during collisionless, stressed $X$-point collapse for varying
out-of-plane guide-fields is studied using a kinetic, 2.5D, fully
electromagnetic, relativistic particle-in-cell numerical code. Cases for both
open and closed boundary conditions are investigated, where magnetic flux and
particles are lost and conserved respectively. It is found that reconnection
rates and out-of-plane currents in the $X$-point increase more rapidly and peak
sooner in the closed boundary case, but higher values are reached in the open
boundary case. The normalized reconnection rate is fast: 0.10-0.25. In the open
boundary case an increase of guide-field yields later onsets in the
reconnection peak rates, while in the closed boundary case initial peak rates
occur sooner but are suppressed. The reconnection current increases for low
guide-fields but then decreases similarly. In the open boundary case, for
guide-fields of the order of the in-plane magnetic field, the generation of
electron vortices occurs. Possible causes of the vortex generation, based on
the flow of particles in the diffusion region and localized plasma heating, are
discussed. Before peak reconnection onset, oscillations in the out-of-plane
electric field at the $X$-point are found, ranging in frequency from
approximately 1 to 2 $\omega_{pe}$ and coinciding with oscillatory
reconnection. These oscillations are found to be part of a larger wave pattern.
Mapping the out-of-plane electric field over time and applying 2D Fourier
transforms reveals that the waves predominantly correspond to the ordinary mode
and may correspond to observable radio waves such as solar radio burst fine
structure spikes.

packing density and where certain quantities show a divergence indicative of
critical behavior. We describe how aspects of the dynamics change as the
jamming density is approached and how these dynamics can be explored using
externally driven probes. Different particle shapes can produce jamming
densities much lower than those observed for disk-shaped particles, and we show
how jamming exhibits fragility for some shapes while for other shapes this is
absent. Next we describe the effects of long range interactions and jamming
behavior in systems such as charged colloids, vortices in type-II
superconductors, and dislocations. We consider the effect of adding obstacles
to frictionless jamming systems and discuss connections between this type of
jamming and systems that exhibit depinning transitions. Finally, we discuss
open questions such as whether the jamming transition in all these different
systems can be described by the same or a small subset of universal behaviors,
as well as future directions for studies of jamming transitions in two

the method in anticipation of more data and better theoretical constraints,
taking the present results at face value already rule out modes of accretion:

XMM-Newton imaging (where available) shows that $80\%$ of these structures are
associated with diffuse, soft-band (0.4 - 1 keV) X-ray emission including
$90\%$ of all objects classified as clusters. The presence of soft-band X-ray
emission in these massive structures (${\rm M}_{200} \geq 4.9 \times 10^{13}
{\rm M}_{\odot}$) provides a strong independent confirmation of our methodology
and classification scheme. Nearly $60\%$ of the clusters, groups and filaments
are detected in the known enhanced density regions of the CDFS at
$z\simeq0.13$, $z\simeq0.52$, $0.68$, and $0.73$. Additionally, all of the
clusters, bar the most distant, are found in these over-dense redshifts
regions. Many of the clusters and groups exhibit signs of on-going formation
seen in their velocity distributions, position within the detected cosmic web
and in one case through the presence of tidally disrupted central galaxies
exhibiting trails of stars. These results all provide strong support for
hierarchical structure formation up to redshifts of 1.

core of efficient algorithms for probabilistic logics. We present a
Skolemization algorithm for model counting problems that eliminates existential
quantifiers from a first-order logic theory without changing its weighted model
count. For certain subsets of first-order logic, lifted model counters were
shown to run in time polynomial in the number of objects in the domain of
discourse, where propositional model counters require exponential time.
However, these guarantees apply only to Skolem normal form theories (i.e., no
existential quantifiers) as the presence of existential quantifiers reduces
lifted model counters to propositional ones. Since textbook Skolemization is
not sound for model counting, these restrictions precluded efficient model
counting for directed models, such as probabilistic logic programs, which rely
on existential quantification. Our Skolemization procedure extends the
applicability of first-order model counters to these representations. Moreover,
it simplifies the design of lifted model counting algorithms.

before the beginning of RGSs and to peak 3 to 4 days after, i.e. on the RGS
recovery phase produced by high-intensity long-duration continuous auroral
activity. The maximum of TEC coincides with the maximum of solar wind velocity
within high-speed solar wind streams. An analysis of electron content vertical
profiles, derived from two independent methods using ionosondes and
COSMIC/FORMOSAT-3 radio occultation, showed that in the maximum of an
ionospheric storm on 28 March 2008, the F2 layer thickens, NmF2 increases by
~50% and hmF2 elevates by a few tens of kilometers. The response of positive
ionospheric storms to solar, heliospheric and geomagnetic drivers reveals a
prominent longitudinal asymmetry. In the longitudinal range from -90 deg to 90
deg, the solar illumination plays a major role, and in the range from 90 deg to
-120 deg, the influence of heliospheric and geomagnetic drivers becomes
significant. The highest correlations of the TEC enhancements with the
heliospheric and geomagnetic drivers were found during December - February
period (r increased from ~ 0.3 to ~0.5). We speculate that the dynamics
controlling this might result from an effect of solar zenith angle, storm-time
effects of thermospheric Sum(O/N2) enhancement, and penetrating electric fields

lineage. The anthropological community agrees on that point. No consensus,
however, has been reached on selection pressures contributing to that growth.
In that respect Martin (1984) can be invoked. In his review of size
relationships among primates he stated that despite the relationship between
brain size, body size and feeding behavior no single interpretation could be
provided that revealed the causality of such relationship.
  This paper deals with one specific aspect of hominid brain growth; the fact
that for most of the hominid period, growth in brain volume was exponential in
character. To the best of our knowledge, no attempt has been made to identify a
selection mechanism that can facilitate just the exponential features of that
growth (as distinct from any of its other characteristics). It is broadly
accepted that the dynamics of this growth were peculiar. Growth was very fast,
or even rapid in the evolutionary scale of time. The most profound evidence of
that opinion was expressed by Haldane that this dramatic increase in brain size
was the most rapid evolutionary change known to him.

topological Ramsey space $\mathcal{R}$, are the notions of selective for
$\mathcal{R}$ and Ramsey for $\mathcal{R}$ equivalent? Every topological Ramsey
space $\mathcal{R}$ has an associated notion of Ramsey ultrafilter for
$\mathcal{R}$ and selective ultrafilter for $\mathcal{R}$ (see
\cite{MijaresSelective}). If $\mathcal{R}$ is taken to be the Ellentuck space
then the two concepts reduce to the familiar notions of Ramsey and selective
ultrafilters on $\omega$; so by a well-known result of Kunen the two are
equivalent. We give the first example of an ultrafilter on a topological Ramsey
space that is selective but not Ramsey for the space, and in fact a countable
collection of such examples.
  For each positive integer $n$ we show that for the topological Ramsey space
$\mathcal{R}_{n}$ from \cite{Ramsey-Class2}, the notions of selective for
$\mathcal{R}_{n}$ and Ramsey for $\mathcal{R}_{n}$ are not equivalent. In
particular, we prove that forcing with a closely related space using
almost-reduction, adjoins an ultrafilter that is selective but not Ramsey for
$\mathcal{R}_{n}$. Moreover, we introduce a notion of finite product among
members of the family $\{\mathcal{R}_{n}: n<\omega\}$. We show that forcing
with closely related product spaces using almost-reduction, adjoins
ultrafilters that are selective but not Ramsey for these product topological
Ramsey spaces.

lose useful filters during their training, contrary to this common perspective.
We attribute this phenomenon to a tradeoff between overcompleteness of GRBM
representations and data fitting. To gain GRBM representations that are
overcomplete and fit data well, we propose a measure for GRBM representation
quality, approximated mutual information, and an early stopping technique based
on this measure. The proposed method boosts performance of classifiers trained

are typical of O-H groups pointing toward Si-O(7)-Al tetrahedral linkages, thus
allowing to characterize the SRO (short-range-order) of TAl in the double

linkages regularly alternate with Si-O(7)-Al linkages along the double chain.

overcoming a barrier in the presence of friction and noise. For weak coupling
to the solution, the reaction rate is limited by the rate at which the solution
can restore equilibrium after a subset of reactants have surmounted the barrier
to become products. For strong coupling, there are always sufficiently
energetic reactants. However, the solution returns many of the intermediate
states back to the reactants before the product fully forms. Here, we
demonstrate that the thermal conductance displays an analogous physical
response to the friction and noise that drive the heat current through a

reservoirs dominate the conductance at the extremes and only in the
intermediate region are the intrinsic properties of the lattice manifest. Not
only does this shed new light on Kramers' classic turnover problem, this result
is significant for the design of devices for thermal management and other

harmonic analytic problems which lie in the heart of research in the field.
  More specifically, we consider discrete analogues of the maximal Kakeya
operator conjecture and of the recently solved endpoint multilinear Kakeya
problem, by effectively shrinking the tubes involved in these problems to
lines, thus giving rise to the problems of counting joints and multijoints with
multiplicities. In fact, we effectively show that, in $\mathbb{R}^3$, what we
expect to hold due to the maximal Kakeya operator conjecture, as well as what
we know in the continuous case due to the endpoint multilinear Kakeya theorem
by Guth, still hold in the discrete case.
  In particular, let $\mathfrak{L}$ be a collection of $L$ lines in
$\mathbb{R}^3$ and $J$ the set of joints formed by $\mathfrak{L}$, that is, the
set of points each of which lies in at least three non-coplanar lines of
$\mathfrak{L}$. It is known that $|J|=O(L^{3/2})$ (first proved by Guth and
Katz). For each joint $x\in J$, let the multiplicity $N(x)$ of $x$ be the
number of triples of non-coplanar lines through $x$. We prove here that
$$\sum_{x\in J} N(x)^{1/2}=O(L^{3/2}), $$while we also extend this result to
real algebraic curves in $\mathbb{R}^3$ of uniformly bounded degree, as well as
to curves in $\mathbb{R}^3$ parametrized by real univariate polynomials of
uniformly bounded degree.
  The multijoints problem is a variant of the joints problem, involving three
finite collections of lines in $\mathbb{R}^3$; a multijoint formed by them is a
point that lies in (at least) three non-coplanar lines, one from each
collection.
  We finally present some results regarding the joints problem in different

asynchronous events: the mean and mean-square convergence rates and the
asymptotic bias values are not degraded relative to synchronous or centralized
implementations. Only the steady-state mean-square-deviation suffers a
degradation in the order of $\nu$, which represents the small step-size
parameters used for adaptation. Second, the results show that the adaptive
distributed network matches the performance of the centralized solution. These
conclusions highlight another critical benefit of cooperation by networked
agents: cooperation does not only enhance performance in comparison to
stand-alone single-agent processing, but it also endows the network with
remarkable resilience to various forms of random failure events and is able to
deliver performance that is as powerful as batch solutions.

vector, standardized to identical margins, grow at the same rate. In this
paper, we consider the effect of allowing the components to grow at different
rates, and characterize the link between these marginal growth rates and the
multivariate tail probability decay rate. Our approach leads to a whole class
of univariate regular variation conditions, in place of the single but
multivariate regular variation conditions that underpin the current theories.
These conditions are indexed by a homogeneous function and an angular
dependence function, which, for asymptotically independent random vectors,
mirror the role played by the exponent measure and Pickands' dependence
function in classical multivariate extremes. We additionally offer an
inferential approach to joint survivor probability estimation. The key feature
of our methodology is that extreme set probabilities can be estimated by
extrapolating upon rays emanating from the origin when the margins of the
variables are exponential. This offers an appreciable improvement over existing
techniques where extrapolation in exponential margins is upon lines parallel to
the diagonal.

method (HIM) approximately solves the Green's function in terms of a spherical
harmonics series, and thus provides analytical ion-ion potentials for the
Hamiltonian of charged systems. The Maxwell Equations Molecular Dynamics (MEMD)
algorithm features a local approach to electrostatics, allowing for arbitrary
local changes of the dielectric constant. We show that the results of both
methods are in very good agreement. We also found that the renormalized charge

changes if the dielectric properties within the vicinity of the colloid are
changed.

dust in the diffuse interstellar medium. We cross-correlate sky maps from
Planck, WMAP, and DIRBE, at 17 frequencies from 23 to 3000 GHz, with the Parkes
survey of the 21-cm line emission of neutral atomic hydrogen, over a contiguous
area of 7500 deg$^2$ centred on the southern Galactic pole. Our analysis yields
four specific results. (1) The dust temperature is observed to be
anti-correlated with the dust emissivity and opacity. We interpret this result
as evidence for dust evolution within the diffuse ISM. The mean dust opacity is
measured to be $(7.1 \pm 0.6) 10^{-27} cm^2/H \times (\nu/353\,
GHz)^{1.53\pm0.03}$ for $100 < \nu <353$GHz. (2) We map the spectral index of
dust emission at millimetre wavelengths, which is remarkably constant at
$\beta_{mm} = 1.51\pm 0.13$. We compare it with the far infrared spectral index
beta_FIR derived from greybody fits at higher frequencies, and find a
systematic difference, $\beta_{mm}-\beta_{FIR} = -0.15$, which suggests that
the dust SED flattens at $\nu < 353\,$GHz. (3) We present spectral fits of the
microwave emission correlated with HI from 23 to 353 GHz, which separate dust
and anomalous microwave emission. The flattening of the dust SED can be
accounted for with an additional component with a blackbody spectrum, which
accounts for $(26 \pm 6)$% of the dust emission at 100 GHz and could represent
magnetic dipole emission. Alternatively, it could account for an increasing
contribution of carbon dust, or a flattening of the emissivity of amorphous
silicates, at millimetre wavelengths. These interpretations make different
predictions for the dust polarization SED. (4) We identify a Galactic
contribution to the residuals of the dust-HI correlation, which we model with
variations of the dust emissivity on angular scales smaller than that of our
correlation analysis.

Convergence of a time varying empirical spectral process indexed by a class of

the test statistic. Compared to other methods proposed in the literature for

the null hypothesis at any rate $g_T\to0$ such that $g_TT^{1/2}\to \infty$,
where $T$ denotes the sample size. On the other hand, the estimator is based on
only one regularization parameter while most alternative procedures require
two. Finite sample properties of the method are investigated by means of a

affected by the rotation of NS. The rotation makes NS, thus the space-time

classification and retrieval, a key component for successful recommendation is
the \emph{audio content representation}.
  Good representations should capture informative musical patterns in the audio
signal of songs. These representations should be concise, to enable efficient
(low storage, easy indexing, fast search) management of huge music
repositories, and should also be easy and fast to compute, to enable real-time
interaction with a user supplying new songs to the system.

improvement in the computational speed is realized by not treating the missing

applied to a real data set collected from a Web questionnaire that asks about
first impressions of human; almost $90\%$ of the data values are missing. When

Jacobians of the spectral curve. We also show that the generalized Jacobians of
the hypereliptic component of the spectral curves are models for the minimal
invariant tori of the flow. Moreover the spectral invariants generate local
actions that span the invariant tori, while the moment maps for the rotational
symmetries provide additional first integrals of the system. Using our results
we reproduce already known facts that the degenerate Neumann system is
superintegrable, if its potencial matrix has eigenvalues of multiplicity
greater or equal than $3$.

The transmission electron microscopy studies evidenced the substantial

nanowires. Optical and transport measurements revealed that the limit of Mn
content for self-catalysed growth of GaAs nanowires corresponds to the doping
level, i.e., is much lower than the Mn/Ga flux ratio (about 3%) used during the
MBE growth. The resistivity measurements of individual nanowires confirmed that
they are conductive, in accordance with the photoluminescence measurements
which showed the presence of Mn2+ acceptors located at Ga sites of the GaAs
host lattice of the nanowires. An anomalous temperature dependence of the
photoluminescence related to excitons was demonstrated for Mn-doped GaAs
nanowires.

simulations called cosmo-OWLS. They form an extension to the OverWhelmingly
Large Simulations (OWLS) project, and have been designed to help improve our
understanding of cluster astrophysics and non-linear structure formation, which
are now the limiting systematic errors when using clusters as cosmological
probes. Starting from identical initial conditions in either the Planck or
WMAP7 cosmologies, we systematically vary the most important `sub-grid'
physics, including feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei (AGN).
We compare the properties of the simulated galaxy groups and clusters to a wide
range of observational data, such as X-ray luminosity and temperature, gas mass
fractions, entropy and density profiles, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich flux, I-band
mass-to-light ratio, dominance of the brightest cluster galaxy, and central
massive black hole (BH) masses, by producing synthetic observations and
mimicking observational analysis techniques. These comparisons demonstrate that
some AGN feedback models can produce a realistic population of galaxy groups
and clusters, broadly reproducing both the median trend and, for the first
time, the scatter in physical properties over approximately two decades in mass
($10^{13} \lesssim M_{500} \lesssim 10^{15}~\textrm{M}_{\odot}$) and 1.5
decades in radius ($0.05 \lesssim r/r_{500} \lesssim 1.5$). However, in other
models, the AGN feedback is too violent (even though they reproduce the
observed BH scaling relations), implying calibration of the models is required.
The production of realistic populations of simulated groups and clusters, as
well as models that bracket the observations, opens the door to the creation of
synthetic surveys for assisting the astrophysical and cosmological
interpretation of cluster surveys, as well as quantifying the impact of
selection effects.

different properties of the deduced estimators, say, $l^2$ regularization leads
to smooth estimators while $l^1$ regularization leads to sparse estimators.
Then, how does the generalization capabilities of $l^q$ regularization learning
vary with $q$? In this paper, we study this problem in the framework of
statistical learning theory and show that implementing $l^q$ coefficient
regularization schemes in the sample dependent hypothesis space associated with
Gaussian kernel can attain the same almost optimal learning rates for all
$0<q<\infty$. That is, the upper and lower bounds of learning rates for $l^q$
regularization learning are asymptotically identical for all $0<q<\infty$. Our
finding tentatively reveals that, in some modeling contexts, the choice of $q$
might not have a strong impact with respect to the generalization capability.
From this perspective, $q$ can be arbitrarily specified, or specified merely by
other no generalization criteria like smoothness, computational complexity,
sparsity, etc..

i.e., pick a sensor to move and then re-run a calibration experiment to
determine if the localization performance had improved or degraded. We present
an RTI system of servo-nodes, RF sensors equipped with servo motors which
autonomously ""dial it in"", i.e., change position and orientation to optimize
the RSS on links of the network. By doing so, the localization accuracy of the
RTI system is quickly improved, without requiring any calibration experiment
from the deployer. Experiments conducted in three indoor environments
demonstrate that the servo-nodes system reduces localization error on average
by 32% compared to a standard RTI system composed of static RF sensors.

created a stochastic simulation model of input timing-dependent Ca$^{2+}$

of Ca$^{2+}$ increases rather than amplitude coding for input timing detection
via stochastic facilitation by utilizing the small number of molecules in a

that any batch of $k$ data items can be retrieved by reading at most one (or
more generally, $t$) items from each server, while keeping the total storage
over $m$ servers equal to $N$. This paper considers a class of batch codes (for
$t=1$), called combinatorial batch codes (CBC), where each server stores a
subset of a database. A CBC is called optimal if the total storage $N$ is
minimal for given $n,m$, and $k$. A $c$-uniform CBC is a combinatorial batch
code where each item is stored in exactly $c$ servers. A $c$-uniform CBC is
called optimal if its parameter $n$ has maximum value for given $m$ and $k$.
Optimal $c$-uniform CBCs have been known only for $c\in \{2,k-1,k-2\}$.
  In this paper we present new constructions of optimal CBCs in both the
uniform and general settings, for values of the parameters where tight bounds
have not been established previously. In the uniform setting, we provide
constructions of two new families of optimal uniform codes with $c\sim

motivated by characterizing natural gravity currents such as oceanic overflows.
We use particle image velocimetry and planar laser-induced fluorescence to
simultaneously measure the velocity and density fields as they evolve
downstream of the initial injection from a turbulent channel flow onto a plane
inclined at 10$^\circ$ with respect to horizontal. The turbulence level of the
input flow is controlled by injecting velocity fluctuations upstream of the
output nozzle. The initial Reynolds number based on Taylor microscale of the
flow, R$_\lambda$, is varied between 40 and 120, and the effects of the initial
turbulence level are assessed. The bulk Richardson number $Ri$ for the flow is
about 0.3 whereas the gradient Richardson number $Ri_g$ varies between 0.04 and
0.25, indicating that shear dominates the stabilizing effect of stratification.
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability results in vigorous vertical transport of mass and
momentum. We present baseline characterization of standard turbulence
quantities and calculate, in several different ways, the fluid entrainment
coefficient $E$, a quantity of considerable interest in mixing parameterization
for ocean circulation models. We also determine properties of mixing as
represented by the flux Richardson number $Ri_f$ as a function of $Ri_g$ and
diapycnal mixing parameter $K_\rho$ versus buoyancy Reynolds number $Re_b$. We
find reasonable agreement with results from natural flows.

the thermal velocity of the plasma, it is subjected to the force of the
electrostatic field induced in the plasma by itself and loses its energy. This
process is well-known as the stopping power of a plasma. In this paper we show
that the same process works in particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations as well and
the energy loss rate of fast particles due to this process is mainly determined
by the number of plasma electrons contained in the electron skin depth volume.
However, since there are generally very few particles in that volume in PIC
simulations compared with real plasmas, the energy loss effect can be
exaggerated significantly and can affect the results. Therefore, especially for
the simulations that investigate the particle acceleration processes, the
number of particles used in the simulations should be chosen large enough to
avoid this artificial energy loss.

the CFT sides. In the gravity side the classical contributions to the
entanglement entropy is still given by the Ryu-Takayanagi area formula under
the reasonable assumption, while the 1-loop quantum corrections have to take
into account of the contributions not only from massless gravitons, but also
from massless higher spin fields. In the CFT side we still use the operator

need to consider the quasiprimary fields constructed from $W$ fields, besides
the ones from Virasoro Verma module. In the large central charge limit, we
obtain the classical, 1-loop, 2-loop, and 3-loop parts of the R\'enyi entropy.

in the shear measurement method must be unambiguously identified and corrected
for. Previous work of this series has demonstrated that cosmic shears can be
measured accurately in Fourier space in the presence of background noise and
finite pixel size, without assumptions on the morphologies of galaxy and PSF.
The remaining major source of error is source Poisson noise, due to the
finiteness of source photon number. This problem is particularly important for
faint galaxies in space-based weak lensing measurements, and for ground-based
images of short exposure times. In this work, we propose a simple and rigorous
way of removing the shear bias from the source Poisson noise. Our noise
treatment can be generalized for images made of multiple exposures through
MultiDrizzle. This is demonstrated with the SDSS and COSMOS/ACS data. With a
large ensemble of mock galaxy images of unrestricted morphologies, we show that
our shear measurement method can achieve sub-percent level accuracy even for
images of signal-to-noise ratio less than 5 in general, making it the most
promising technique for cosmic shear measurement in the ongoing and upcoming
large scale galaxy surveys.

study. We have investigated the condensation of SiO molecules at low
temperature using neon matrix and helium droplet isolation techniques. The
energies of SiO polymerization reactions have been determined experimentally
with a calorimetric method and theoretically with calculations based on the
density functional theory. The combined experimental and theoretical values
have revealed the formation of cyclic (SiO)$_k$ ($k$ = 2--3) clusters inside
helium droplets at $T$ = 0.37 K. Therefore, the oligomerization of SiO
molecules is found to be barrierless and is expected to be fast in the
low-temperature environment of the interstellar medium on the surface of dust
grains. The incorporation of numerous SiO molecules in helium droplets leads to
the formation of nanoscale amorphous SiO grains. Similarly, the annealing and
evaporation of SiO-doped Ne matrices lead to the formation of solid amorphous
SiO on the substrate. The structure and composition of the grains were
determined by infrared absorption spectroscopy, transmission electron
microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Our results support the
hypothesis that interstellar silicates \textbf{can be formed} in the low

observed in optical and near-infrared seems to have no counterpart in

inhomogeneous jet or a turbulent extreme multi-cell scenario. The radio spectra
showed a variability pattern typical of relativistic jets.

reconstruction task is a highly ill-posed nonlinear inverse problem, which is
very sensitive to noise, and requires the use of regularized solution methods,
of which D-bar is the only proven method. The resulting EIT images have low
spatial resolution due to smoothing caused by low-pass filtered regularization.
In many applications, such as medical imaging, it is known \emph{a priori} that
the target contains sharp features such as organ boundaries, as well as
approximate ranges for realistic conductivity values. In this paper, we use
this information in a new edge-preserving EIT algorithm, based on the original
D-bar method coupled with a deblurring flow stopped at a minimal data
discrepancy. The method makes heavy use of a novel data fidelity term based on
the so-called {\em CGO sinogram}. This nonlinear data step provides superior
robustness over traditional EIT data formats such as current-to-voltage

endogenous submicron granules in the cytoplasm of living biological cells has
been demonstrated in a number of experiments and has been attributed to the
viscoelastic physical nature of the cellular cytoplasm. This finding provokes
the question to which extent active intracellular transport is affected by this
viscoelastic environment: does the subdiffusion of free submicron cargo such as
vesicles and organelles always imply anomalously slow transport by molecular
motors such as kinesins, that is, directed transport characterized by a
sublinear growth of the mean distance, $\langle x(t)\rangle\simeq
t^{\alpha_{\rm eff}}$, with $0<\alpha_{\rm eff}<1$? Here we study a generic
model approach combining the commonly accepted two-state Brownian ratchet model
of kinesin motors based on the continuous-state diffusion along microtubule
driven by a flashing binding potential. The motor is elastically coupled to a
cargo particle, which in turn is subject to the viscoelastic cytoplasmic
environment. Depending on the physical parameters of cargo size, loading force,
amplitude of the binding potential, and the turnover frequency of the molecular
motor, the transport can be both normal ($\alpha_{\rm eff}=1$) and anomalous
($\alpha\leq \alpha_{\rm eff}<1$). In particular, we demonstrate in detail how
highly efficient normal motor transport can emerge despite the anomalously slow
passive diffusion of cargo particles, and how the active motion of the same
motor in the same cell may turn anomalously slow when the parameters are
changed.

thus, a key determinant of the most important biogeochemical cycles in the
planet. Therefore, a correct description of the ecological and evolutionary
behavior of these viruses is essential to make reliable predictions about their
role in marine ecosystems. The infection cycle, for example, is indistinctly
modeled in two very different ways. In one representation, the process is
described including explicitly a fixed delay between infection and offspring
release. In the other, the offspring are released at exponentially distributed
times according to a fixed release rate. By considering obvious quantitative
differences pointed out in the past, the latter description is widely used as a
simplification of the former. However, it is still unclear how the dichotomy
""delay versus rate description"" affects long-term predictions of host-virus
interaction models. Here, we study the ecological and evolutionary implications
of using one or the other approaches, applied to marine microbes. To this end,
we use mathematical and eco-evolutionary computational analysis. We show that
the rate model exhibits improved competitive abilities from both ecological and
evolutionary perspectives in steady environments. However, rate-based
descriptions can fail to describe properly long-term microbe-virus
interactions. Moreover, additional information about trade-offs between
life-history traits is needed in order to choose the most reliable
representation for oceanic bacteriophage dynamics. This result affects deeply
most of the marine ecosystem models that include viruses, especially when used
to answer evolutionary questions.

orbital order observed in the monoclinic phase. The energy difference between
the tetragonal and the monoclinic structure is tiny, and most likely results
from the interplay between volume, covalency, and localization effects. The

Nevertheless, once the monoclinic distortions are present, super-exchange helps
in stabilizing the low symmetry structure. The orbital order we obtain for this

act as mediators of effective interactions among their common targets
(competing endogenous RNAs or ceRNAs) has brought forward the idea ('ceRNA
hypothesis') that RNAs can regulate each other in extended 'cross-talk'
networks. Such an ability might play a major role in post-transcriptional
regulation (PTR) in shaping a cell's protein repertoire. Recent work focusing
on the emergent properties of the cross-talk networks has emphasized the high
flexibility and selectivity that may be achieved at stationarity. On the other
hand, dynamical aspects, possibly crucial on the relevant time scales, are far
less clear. We have carried out a dynamical study of the ceRNA hypothesis on a
model of PTR. Sensitivity analysis shows that ceRNA cross-talk is dynamically
extended, i.e. it may take place on time scales shorter than those required to
achieve stationairity even in cases where no cross-talk occurs in the steady
state, and is possibly amplified. Besides, in case of large, transfection-like
perturbations the system may develop strongly non-linear, threshold response.
Finally, we show that the ceRNA effect provides a very efficient way for a cell
to achieve fast positive shifts in the level of a ceRNA when necessary. These
results indicate that competition for miRNAs may indeed provide an elementary
mechanism to achieve system-level regulatory effects on the transcriptome over
physiologically relevant time scales.

suitable for numerical implementation. It is shown that the widely used
discretization approach incurs rather large errors. Motivated by this
observation, a correction is proposed, which significantly increases the
accuracy by cancelling errors associated with the discretization. As an
additional result, we derive equations to treat the interactions between
differently sized particles, i.e., a non-homogeneous discretization spacing.
This presents an important step forward for the applicability of the PMB model
to complex geometries, where it is desired to model interesting parts with a
fine resolution (small particle spacings) and other parts with a coarse
resolution in order to gain numerical efficiency. Validation of the corrected
Peridynamic model is performed by comparing longitudinal sound wave propagation
velocities with exact theoretical results. We find that the corrected approach
correctly reproduces the sound wave velocity, while the original approach
severely overestimates this quantity. Additionally, we present simulations for
a crack growth problem which can be analytically solved within the framework of

energy balanced optimal strategy for rotating the role of cluster head in a
cluster, maintaining intra and inter cluster connectivity and optimal data
routing in the network.
  In this paper, we study a protocol supporting an energy efficient clustering,
cluster head selection and data routing method to extend the lifetime of sensor
network. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed protocol prolongs
network lifetime due to the use of efficient clustering, cluster head selection
and data routing. The results of simulation show that at the end of some
certain part of running the EECS and Fuzzy based clustering algorithm increases
the number of alive nodes comparing with the LEACH and HEED methods and this
can lead to an increase in sensor network lifetime. By using the EECS method
the total number of messages received at base station is increased when
compared with LEACH and HEED methods. The Fuzzy based clustering method
compared with the K-Means Clustering by means of iteration count and time taken
to die first node in wireless sensor network, as the result shows that the

$\mathscr{X}_k$ which are framed along the compactification gerbe. We prove
that this moduli space is a smooth quasi-projective variety, compute its
dimension, and classify its fixed points under the natural induced toric
action. We use this construction to compute the partition functions and
correlators of chiral BPS operators for $\mathcal{N}=2$ quiver gauge theories

computed with and without couplings to bifundamental matter hypermultiplets and
expressed in terms of toric blowup formulas, which relate them to the
corresponding Nekrasov partition functions on the affine toric subsets of
$X_k$. We compare our new partition functions with previous computations,
explore their connections to the representation theory of affine Lie algebras,

presence of prominent marginal resonances are considered in the perturbed
pendulum model of nonlinear resonance. The fields of applicability of these
methods are explicitly and precisely formulated. The comparative accuracy is
investigated in massive and long-run numerical experiments. It is shown that
the methods are naturally subdivided in classes applicable for adiabatic and
non-adiabatic cases of perturbation. It is explicitly shown that the pendulum
approximation of marginal resonance works good in the non-adiabatic case. In
this case, the role of marginal resonances in determining the total layer width
is demonstrated to diminish with increasing the main parameter \lambda (equal
to the ratio of the perturbation frequency to the frequency of small-amplitude
phase oscillations on the resonance). Solely the ""bending effect"" is important
in determining the total amplitude of the energy deviations of the
near-separatrix motion at \lambda > 7. In the adiabatic case, it is
demonstrated that the geometrical form of the separatrix cell can be described
analytically quite easily by means of using a specific representation of the
separatrix map. It is shown that the non-adiabatic (and, to some extent,
intermediary) case is most actual, in comparison with the adiabatic one, for

Cambrian Explosion. Networks are based on addressing systems which are used to
construct network links. The more complex the network the greater the number of
links and the larger the required address space. It has been assumed that
combinations of transcription factors generate a large enough address space to
form GRNs that are complex enough to control the development of complex
multicellular life. However, it is shown in this article that transcription
factors do not have sufficient combinatorial power to serve as the basis of an
addressing system for regulatory control of genomes in the development of
complex organisms. It is proven that given $n$ transcription factor genes in a
genome and address combinations of length $k$ then there are at most $n/k$
k-length transcription factor addresses in the address space. The complexity of
embryonic development requires a corresponding complexity of control
information in the cell and its genome. Therefore, a different addressing
system must exist to form the complex control networks required for complex
control systems. It is postulated that a new type of network evolved based on
an RNA-DNA addressing system that utilized and subsumed the extant GRNs. These
new developmental control networks are called CENES (for Control genes). The
evolution of these new higher networks would explain how the Cambrian Explosion
was possible. The architecture of these higher level networks may in fact be
universal (modulo syntax) in the genomes of all multicellular life.

cell. Science 322, 442-446). In the present report, a lac repressor
(LacI)-mediated DNA immunoprecipitation experiment reveals that the natural
LacI-lac DNA complex built in vivo is extremely tight and long-lived compared
to the time scale of lac expression dynamics, which could functionally
disconnect the abortive expression bursts and forbid using the standard modes
of lac bistability. As alternatives, purely kinetic mechanisms are examined for
their capacity to restrict induction through: (i) widely scattered derepression
related to the arrival time variance of a predominantly backward asymmetric
random walk and (ii) an induction threshold arising in a single window of
derepression without recourse to nonlinear multimeric binding and Hill
functions. Considering the complete disengagement of the lac repressor from the
lac promoter as the probabilistic consequence of a transient stepwise
mechanism, is sufficient to explain the sigmoidal lac responses as functions of
time and of inducer concentration. This sigmoidal shape can be misleadingly
interpreted as a phenomenon of equilibrium cooperativity classically used to
explain bistability, but which has been reported to be weak in this system.

is also seen that collisions reduce the peaking factor for low-Z impurities,
while increasing it for high charge numbers, which is attributed to a shift in
the transport spectra towards higher wavenumbers with the addition of
collisions. With the addition of roto-diffusion, an overall reduction of the
peaking factors is observed, but this decrease is not sufficient to explain the

alternative to traditional probabilistic modeling: instead of parametrizing the

chain whose stationary distribution is an estimator of the data generating
distribution. The result of training is therefore a machine that generates
samples through this Markov chain. However, the previously introduced GSN
consistency theorems suggest that in order to capture a wide class of
distributions, the transition operator in general should be multimodal,
something that has not been done before this paper. We introduce for the first
time multimodal transition distributions for GSNs, in particular using models
in the NADE family (Neural Autoregressive Density Estimator) as output
distributions of the transition operator. A NADE model is related to an RBM
(and can thus model multimodal distributions) but its likelihood (and
likelihood gradient) can be computed easily. The parameters of the NADE are
obtained as a learned function of the previous state of the learned Markov
chain. Experiments clearly illustrate the advantage of such multimodal
transition distributions over unimodal GSNs.

the $SU(3)$ gauge group of QCD is replaced by the exceptional Lie group $G_2$,
does not have a sign problem and can be simulated at such densities using
standard lattice techniques. It thus provides benchmarks to models and
functional continuum methods, and it serves to unravel the nature of possible
phases of strongly interacting matter at high densities. Instrumental in
understanding these phases is that $G_2$-QCD has fermionic baryons, and that it
can therefore sustain a baryonic Fermi surface. Because the baryon spectrum of
$G_2$-QCD also contains bosonic diquark and probably other more exotic states,
it is important to understand this spectrum before one can disentangle the
corresponding contributions to the baryon density. Here we present the first
systematic study of this spectrum from lattice simulations at different quark
masses. This allows us to relate the mass hierarchy, ranging from scalar
would-be-Goldstone bosons and intermediate vector bosons to the $G_2$-nucleons

various treatment regimens of radiation therapy, defined as the probability
that given a prescribed dose of radiation, a tumour has been eradicated or
controlled. In the traditional view of cancer, all cells share the ability to
divide without limit and thus have the potential to generate a malignant
tumour. However, an emerging notion is that only a sub-population of cells, the
so-called cancer stem cells (CSCs), are responsible for the initiation and
maintenance of the tumour. A key implication of the CSC hypothesis is that
these cells must be eradicated to achieve cures, thus we define TCP_S as the
probability of eradicating CSCs for a given dose of radiation. A cell surface
protein expression profile, such as CD44high/CD24low for breast cancer, is
often used as a biomarker to monitor CSCs enrichment. However, it is
increasingly recognized that not all cells bearing this expression profile are
necessarily CSCs, and in particular early generations of progenitor cells may
share the same phenotype. Thus, due to the lack of a perfect biomarker for
CSCs, we also define a novel measurable TCP_CD+, that is the probability of
eliminating or controlling biomarker positive cells. Based on these
definitions, we use stochastic methods and numerical simulations to compare the
theoretical TCP_S and the measurable TCP_CD+. We also use the measurable TCP to
compare the effect of various radiation protocols.

initiated by Fakhuruddin in the 1980s. In 1986 he proved that, in the category

amalgmation base and every commutative pogroup is a strong amalgamation base.
Some twenty years later, Bulman-Fleming and Sohail in 2011 extended this work
to what they referred to as pomonoid amalgams. In particular they proved that
pogroups are poamalgmation bases in the category of pomonoids. Sohail, also in
2011, proved that absolutely poflat commutative pomonoids are poamalgmation
bases in the category of commutative pomonoids. In the present paper we extend
the work on pomonoid amalgams by generalising the work of Renshaw on amalgams
of monoids and extension properties of acts over monoids.

inside the numerically broadened shock (Fryxell et al. 1989). We have performed
a series of simulations to verify the efficacy of this approximation and to
understand how resolution and dimensionality might affect its use. Our results
show that, in one dimension, prohibiting burning in the shock is important
wherever the carbon burning length is not resolved, in keeping with the results
of Fryxell et al. (1989). In two dimensions, we find that the prohibition of
shock burning effectively inhibits the development of cellular structure for
all but the most highly-resolved cases. We discuss the possible impacts this
outcome may have on sub-grid models and detonation propagation in models of
Type Ia supernovae, including potential impacts on observables.

306414 as B0.5 Ia. From the model fit, we find Teff = 24 700 K and log g = 2.7,
in good agreement with the morphological classification. Using the interstellar
lines in its spectrum, we estimate a distance to HD 306414 d > 7 kpc. Assuming
this distance, we derive R* = 40 Rsol and Mspect = 30 Msol (consistent, within
errors, with Mevol = 38 Msol). Radial velocity changes are not dominated by the
orbital motion, and we find an upper limit on the semi-amplitude for the
optical component Kopt < 11 +- 6 km/s. Large variations in the depth and shape
of photospheric lines suggest the presence of strong pulsations, which may be
the main cause of the radial velocity changes. Very significant variations,
uncorrelated with those of the photospheric lines are seen in the shape and
position of the Halpha emission feature around the time of the X-ray outburst,
but large excursions are also observed at other times. HD 306414 is a normal
B0.5 Ia supergiant. Its radial velocity curve is dominated by an effect that is
different from binary motion, and is most likely stellar pulsations. The data
available suggest that the X-ray outbursts are caused by the close passage of
the neutron star in a very eccentric orbit, perhaps leading to localised mass
outflow. (abridged).

rates for the case of bufferless M/M/1 and M/G/1 queues. In particular, it is
shown that a bufferless M/M/1 queue at worst suffers less than 10% reduction in
capacity when compared to an M/M/1 work-conserving queue.

introduced in our previous work, is clarified. The business aspect of this
method is transformation of a classifier into an object detector/locator via an
image grid. This is a universal framework for locating objects of interest
through classification. The framework standardizes and simplifies
implementation of custom systems by doing only a custom analysis of the
classification results on the image grid.

locally equivalent to an accelerated frame and can be transformed away. Again
it is indistinguishable from the geometry of space-time (which is an arena for
all other basic interactions), its strength being linked with the curvature.
This is a major reason why it has so far not been amenable to quantisation like
other interactions. It is also evident that new ideas are required to resolve
several conundrums in areas like cosmology, black hole physics, and particles
at high energies. That gravity can have strong coupling at microscales has also
been suggested in several contexts earlier. Here we develop some of these
ideas, especially in connection with the high accelerations experienced by
particles at microscales, which would be interpreted as strong local
gravitational fields. The consequences are developed for various situations and
possible experimental manifestations are discussed.

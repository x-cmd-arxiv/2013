rates at reconstructed surfaces is described. Collective diffusion coefficient
is calculated by the variational approach. Anisotropy of the collective
particle motion is analyzed as a function of jump rates and local particle
density. Analytic expressions are compared with the results of Monte Carlo
simulations of diffusing particle and dimer mixture. Direction of driven
diffusive motion of the same system depends on the jump anisotropy and on the
value of driving force. Driven motion results in the particle and dimer
separation when the directions of their easy diffusion axes differ. It is shown
that in such case trapping sites concentrated at some surface areas act as
filters or barriers for particle and dimer mixtures.

expected end-to-end bit error rate (BER) values are frequently required to
compare the proposed coding, relaying, and decoding techniques. Instead of
obtaining these values via time consuming Monte Carlo simulations, deriving
closed form expressions using approximations is crucial. In this work, the
ultimate goal is to derive an approximate average BER expression for a network
coded system. While reaching this goal, we firstly consider the cooperative
systems' instantaneous BER values that are commonly composed of Q-functions of
more than one variables. For these Q-functions, we investigate the convergence
characteristics of the sampling property and generalize this property to
arbitrary functions of multiple variables. Second, we adapt the equivalent
channel approach to the network coded scenario for the ease of analysis and
propose a network decoder with reduced complexity. Finally, by combining these
techniques, we show that the obtained closed form expressions well agree with
simulation results in a wide SNR range.

This contradicts the widely accepted viewpoint that TMD- factorization does not
hold in such processes even in the generalized sense. The key point is that
singular points of the type l+ = 0 can be absorbed into Wilson lines of soft
gluons, where l is collinear to the plus direction. Thus one should subtract
such singular points from the collinear region of l. After such subtraction,
one can make use of Ward identity to absorb effects of scalar-polarized

gas correlates with recent star formation, suggesting that the formation of
this gas phase may help regulate star formation. A key test of this idea
requires wide-area, high-resolution maps of dense molecular gas in galaxies to
explore how local physical conditions drive dense gas formation, but these
observations have been limited because of the faintness of dense gas tracers
like HCN and HCO+. Here we demonstrate the power of the Robert C. Byrd Green
Bank Telescope -- the largest single-dish millimeter radio telescope -- for
mapping dense gas in galaxies by presenting the most sensitive maps yet of HCN
and HCO+ in the starburst galaxy M82. The HCN and HCO+ in the disk of this
galaxy correlates with both recent star formation and more diffuse molecular
gas and shows kinematics consistent with a rotating torus. The HCO+ emission
extending to the north and south of the disk is coincident with the outflow
previously identified in CO and traces the eastern edge of the hot outflowing
gas. The central starburst region has a higher ratio of star formation to dense
gas than the outer regions, pointing to the starburst as a key driver of this
relationship. These results establish that the GBT can efficiently map the
dense molecular gas at 90 GHz in nearby galaxies, a capability that will
increase further with the 16 element feed array under construction.

hadrons by using high-energy reaction processes, where quarks and gluons are
appropriate degrees of freedom. In particular, it should be valuable to
investigate the high-energy exclusive processes which include generalized
parton distributions (GPDs) and generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs). The
GPDs and GDAs contain momentum distributions of partons and form factors. We
found that the exotic nature appears in momentum distributions of quarks as
suggested by the constituent-counting rule and in the form factors associated
with exotic hadron sizes and the number of constituents. Transition GPDs to
exotic hadrons could probe such exotic signatures. We also propose that these
exotic signatures should be found in exclusive production processes of exotic
hadrons from gamma^* gamma in electron-positron annihilation. For example, the
GDAs contain information on a time-like form factor of the energy-momentum
tensor of a hadron h. We show that the cross section of e gamma -> e+hbar h is
sensitive to the exotic signature by looking at the hbar h invariant-mass
dependence by taking light hadrons, h=f_0 (980) and a_0 (980). From such GDA
measurements, the tomography of exotic hadrons becomes possible, for example,
by Belle and BaBar experiments and by future linear collider.

hessian of $f$ (or by abusing the terminology the hessian of $X$) is the
determinant of the matrix of the second derivatives of the form $f$, that is
the determinant of the hessian matrix of $f$. Hypersurfaces with vanishing
hessian were studied systematically for the first time in the fundamental paper
[GN], where Gordan and M. Noether analyze Hesse's claims in [Hesse1, Hesse2]
according to which these hypersurfaces are necessarily cones. Of course cones
have vanishing hessian.
  Clearly the claim is true if deg(X)=2 so that the first relevant case for the
problem is that of cubic hypersurfaces. One immediately sees that $V(x_0x_3^2 +
x_1x_3x_4 + x_2x_4^2)\subset \mathbb P^4$ is a cubic hypersurface with
vanishing hessian but not a cone (for example one could check that the first
partial derivatives of the equation are linearly independent). As firstly
pointed out in [GN], the claim is true for $N\leq 3$ and in general false for
every $N\geq 4$.
  Here we prove that for $N\leq 6$ an irreducible cubic hypersurface with
vanishing hessian in $\mathbb P^N$ is either a cone or a scroll in linear
spaces tangent to the dual of the image of the polar map of the hypersurface.
We also provide canonical forms and a projective characterization of {\it
Special Perazzo Cubic Hypersurfaces}, which, a posteriori, exhaust the class of
cubic hypersurfaces with vanishing hessian, not cones, for $N\leq 6$. Finally
we show by pertinent examples the technical difficulties arising for $N\geq 7$.

study the corresponding modified Kramers equation for this process. We consider
the consequent approximations to this equation in powers of the quantity
inverse to the medium resistance per unit of mass of the particle in the

where from the usual Kramers equation for the evolution of probability density
of the Brownian motion of a particle in the phase space, one deduces an
approximate description of this process by the Fokker--Planck equation for the
density of probability distribution in the configuration space. We prove that
the zero (invertible) approximation to our model with respect to the large

description by the Schr\""odinger equation with the standard Hamilton operator.

using first-principles calculations. We have identified two key effects: (1)
The concentration of H vacancy in the $+1$ charge state (V$_H^{+1}$) can
increase by several orders of magnitude upon Li doping, which significantly
increases the vacancy mediated H diffusion rate. It is caused by the preferred
charge states of substitutional Li in the $-1$ state (Li$_{Mg}^{-1}$) and of
interstitial Li in the $+1$ state (Li$_i^{+1}$), which indirectly reduce the
formation energy of V$_H^{+1}$ by up to 0.39 eV depending on the position of
Fermi energy. (2) The interaction between V$_H^{+1}$ and Li$_{Mg}^{-1}$ is
found to be attractive with a binding energy of 0.55 eV, which immobilizes the
V$_H^{+1}$ next to Li$_{Mg}^{-1}$ at high Li doping concentration. As a result,
the competition between these two effects leads to large enhancement of H
diffusion at low Li doping concentration due to the increased H-vacancy
concentration, but only limited enhancement at high Li concentration due to the
immobilization of H vacancies by too many Li.

nonassociativity is characterised by the associator 3-cocycle which controls
non-coassociativity of the quasi-Hopf algebra. We use abelian 2-cocycle twists

family of associative star products parametrized by constant momentum surfaces

a bound on the Higgs boson width from the WW channel between $\Gamma_H <

cuts applied in the existing experimental analysis. The stricter cuts designed
to search for the on-shell Higgs boson limit the potential number of off-shell
events, weakening the constraints. As some of the cuts are lifted the bounds
improve. We show that there is potential in the high transverse mass region to
produce upper bounds of the order of $(25-50) \Gamma_H^{SM}$, depending
strongly on the level of systematic uncertainty that can be obtained. Thus, if
these systematics can be controlled, a constraint on the Higgs boson width from

Noise on the inputs is shown to impose regularization, and when synchronization
upstream induces time-varying correlations across noise variables, the degree
of regularization can be calibrated over time. The proposed mechanism is
explored first in the context of a simple associative learning problem, and

atmospheres, through which it was determined that it occurs only in the
simultaneous presence of both CO2 and H2O. A hydrated sodium carbonate is the
primary decomposition product along with altered Na2IrO3. The diffraction
signature of the altered Na2IrO3 is quite similar to that of the pristine
material, which makes the detection of decomposition difficult in a sample
handled under ordinary laboratory conditions. The decomposed samples show a
significantly decreased magnetic susceptibility and the disappearance of the
low temperature antiferromagnetic transition considered to be characteristic of
the phase. Samples that have never been exposed to air after synthesis display
a previously unreported magnetic transition at 5K.

accuracy of high-order spectral or finite difference methods with the geometric
flexibility of low-order finite volume or finite element schemes. The Flux
Reconstruction (FR) approach unifies various high-order schemes for
unstructured grids within a single framework. Additionally, the FR approach
exhibits a significant degree of element locality, and is thus able to run
efficiently on modern streaming architectures, such as Graphical Processing
Units (GPUs). The aforementioned properties of FR mean it offers a promising
route to performing affordable, and hence industrially relevant,
scale-resolving simulations of hitherto intractable unsteady flows within the
vicinity of real-world engineering geometries. In this paper we present PyFR,
an open-source Python based framework for solving advection-diffusion type
problems on streaming architectures using the FR approach. The framework is
designed to solve a range of governing systems on mixed unstructured grids
containing various element types. It is also designed to target a range of
hardware platforms via use of an in-built domain specific language based on the
Mako templating engine. The current release of PyFR is able to solve the
compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations on grids of quadrilateral and
triangular elements in two dimensions, and hexahedral elements in three
dimensions, targeting clusters of CPUs, and NVIDIA GPUs. Results are presented
for various benchmark flow problems, single-node performance is discussed, and
scalability of the code is demonstrated on up to 104 NVIDIA M2090 GPUs. The

clusters, observed within the ACS Treasury Program (PI: Ata Sarajedini) with

Catalogs of Stetson (2000, 2005). We focus on the transformation between the
HST/ACS F606W to V-band and F814W to I-band only. The goal is to assess the
validity of the filter transformation equations by Sirianni et al.(2005) with
respect to their dependence on metallicity, Horizontal Branch morphology, mass
and integrated (V-I) colour of the various globular clusters. Such a dependence
is expected due to the fact that the transformation equations are based on the
observations of only one globular cluster, i.e., NGC 2419. Surprisingly, the
correlation between offset and metallicity is found to be weak, with a low
level significance. The correlation between offset and Horizontal Branch
structure, as well as total cluster mass is still weaker. Based on the
available data we do not find the photometric offset to be linked to multiple
stellar populations, e.g., as found in NGC 0288, NGC 1851, and NGC 5139. The
results of this study show that there are small systematic offsets between the
transformed ACS- and observed ground based photometry, and that these are only
weakly correlated, if at all, with various cluster parameters and their
underlying stellar populations. As a result, investigators wishing to transform
globular cluster photometry from the Sirianni et al.(2005) ground-based V, I
system onto the Stetson (2000) system simply need to add 0.040 (+/-0.012) to
the V-band magnitudes and 0.047 (+/-0.011) to the I-band magnitudes. This in
turn means that the transformed ACS (V-I) colours match the ground-based values
from Stetson (2000) to within ~0.01 mag.

considerably redistribute positions and luminosities of shells. Neglecting them

next target points. The most direct trajectories are prone to collision that
could damage the robots and impact the survey operation. We thus present here a
motion planning method based on a novel decentralized navigation function for
collision-free coordination of fiber positioners. The navigation function takes
into account the configuration of positioners as well as the actuator
constraints. We provide details for the proof of convergence and collision
avoidance. Decentralization results in linear complexity for the motion
planning as well as dependency of motion duration with respect to the number of
positioners. Therefore the coordination method is scalable for large-scale
spectrograph robots. The short in-motion duration of positioner robots (~2.5
seconds using typical actuator constraints), will thus allow the time dedicated
for observation to be maximized.

conceptually superior to Value-at-Risk (VaR). At the same time, however, it has
been criticised for issues relating to backtesting. In particular, ES has been
found not to be elicitable which means that backtesting for ES is less
straightforward than, e.g., backtesting for VaR. Expectiles have been suggested
as potentially better alternatives to both ES and VaR. In this paper, we
revisit commonly accepted desirable properties of risk measures like coherence,
comonotonic additivity, robustness and elicitability. We check VaR, ES and
Expectiles with regard to whether or not they enjoy these properties, with
particular emphasis on Expectiles. We also consider their impact on capital
allocation, an important issue in risk management. We find that, despite the
caveats that apply to the estimation and backtesting of ES, it can be
considered a good risk measure. As a consequence, there is no sufficient
evidence to justify an all-inclusive replacement of ES by Expectiles in
applications. For backtesting ES, we propose an empirical approach that
consists in replacing ES by a set of four quantiles, which should allow to make
use of backtesting methods for VaR.

from log$_{10}$(N(H I)) $\approx 19.6 - 21.1$, with corresponding visual

accurately determine the production costs and therefore ensure profitability.
Indeed, quantifying the risks long before the effective manufacturing process
enables fact-based decision-making. From the development stage, improvement
efforts can be early identified and prioritized. In order to measure the impact
of industrial process fluctuations on the product performances, the
construction of a failure risk probability estimator is presented in this
article. The complex relationship between the process technology and the
product design (non linearities, multi-modal features...) is handled via random
process regression. A random field encodes, for each product configuration, the
available information regarding the risk of non-compliance. After a brief
presentation of the Gaussian model approach, we describe a Bayesian reasoning
avoiding a priori choices of location and scale parameters. The Gaussian
mixture prior, conditioned by measured (or calculated) data, yields a posterior
characterized by a multivariate Student distribution. The probabilistic nature
of the model is then operated to derive a failure risk probability, defined as
a random variable. To do this, our approach is to consider as random all
unknown, inaccessible or fluctuating data. In order to propagate uncertainties,
a fuzzy set approach provides an appropriate framework for the implementation
of a Bayesian model mimicking expert elicitation. The underlying leitmotiv is
to insert minimal a priori information in the failure risk model. The relevancy
of this concept is illustrated with theoretical examples.

method to output an $\varepsilon$-accurate solution in expectation, measured in
the number of passes over data, or equivalently, in units equivalent to the
computation of a single gradient of the loss, is
$O((\kappa/n)\log(1/\varepsilon))$, where $\kappa$ is the condition number.
This is achieved by running the method for $O(\log(1/\varepsilon))$ epochs,
with a single gradient evaluation and $O(\kappa)$ stochastic gradient
evaluations in each. The SVRG method of Johnson and Zhang arises as a special
case. If our method is limited to a single epoch only, it needs to evaluate at
most $O((\kappa/\varepsilon)\log(1/\varepsilon))$ stochastic gradients. In
contrast, SVRG requires $O(\kappa/\varepsilon^2)$ stochastic gradients. To
illustrate our theoretical results, S2GD only needs the workload equivalent to
about 2.1 full gradient evaluations to find an $10^{-6}$-accurate solution for
a problem with $n=10^9$ and $\kappa=10^3$.

Time-dependent resonant processes are particularly challenging for available
TDDFT approximations, due to their strong non-linear and non-adiabatic
character. None of the known approximate density functionals are able to cope
with this class of problems in a satisfactory manner. In this work we look at
the prototypical example of the resonant processes by considering Rabi
oscillations within the exactly soluble 2-site Hubbard model. We construct the
exact adiabatic xc functional and show that (i) it does not reproduce correctly
resonant Rabi dynamics, (ii) there is a sizable non-adiabatic contribution to
the exact xc potential, which turns out to be small only at the beginning and
at the end of the Rabi cycle when the ground state population is dominant. We
then propose a ""two-level"" approximation for the time-dependent xc potential
which can capture Rabi dynamics in the 2-site problem. It works well both for
resonant and for detuned Rabi oscillations and becomes essentially exact in the
linear response regime. This new, fully non-adiabatic and explicit density
functional constitutes one of the main results of the present work.

demographic groups. We demonstrate that if incarceration can be spread through
a social influence network, then even relatively small differences in
sentencing can result in the large disparities in incarceration rates.
Controlling for effects of transmissibility, susceptibility, and influence
network structure, our model reproduces the observed large disparities in
incarceration rates given the differences in sentence lengths for White and
Black drug offenders in the United States without extensive parameter tuning.
We further establish the suitability of the SIS model as applied to
incarceration, as the observed structural patterns of recidivism are an
emergent property of the model. In fact, our model shows a remarkably close
correspondence with California incarceration data, without requiring any
parameter tuning. This work advances efforts to combine the theories and

large Hilbert space of the superconformal ghost sector. We discuss its relation
to the Witten formulation based on the small Hilbert space. We introduce a
one-parameter family of conditions for partial gauge fixing of the Berkovits
formulation such that the cubic interaction of the theory under the partial
gauge fixing reduces to that of the Witten formulation in a singular limit. The
local picture-changing operator at the open-string midpoint in the Witten
formulation is regularized in our approach, and the divergence in on-shell
four-point amplitudes coming from collision of picture-changing operators is
resolved. The quartic interaction inherited from the Berkovits formulation
plays a role of adjusting different behaviors of the picture-changing operators
in the $s$ channel and in the $t$ channel of Feynman diagrams with two cubic
vertices, and correct amplitudes in the world-sheet theory are reproduced.
While gauge invariance at the second order in the coupling constant is obscured
in the Witten formulation by collision of picture-changing operators, it is
well defined in our approach and is recovered by including the quartic
interaction inherited from the Berkovits formulation.

shocks around some red supergiants (RSGs) might be caused by the ionization of
their winds by external sources of radiation. Our numerical simulations of the
bow shock generated by IRC-10414 (the first-ever RSG with an optically detected
bow shock) show that the ionization of the wind results in its acceleration by
a factor of two, which reduces the difference between the wind and space
velocities of the star and makes the contact discontinuity of the bow shock
stable for a range of stellar space velocities and mass-loss rates. Our best
fit model reproduces the overall shape and surface brightness of the observed
bow shock and suggests that the space velocity and mass-loss rate of IRC-10414
are $\approx$50 ${\rm km} \, {\rm s}^{-1}$ and $\approx$$10^{-6}$ $M_\odot \,
{\rm yr}^{-1}$, respectively, and that the number density of the local ISM is
$\approx$3 ${\rm cm}^{-3}$. It also shows that the bow shock emission comes
mainly from the shocked stellar wind. This naturally explains the enhanced
nitrogen abundance in the line-emitting material, derived from the spectroscopy
of the bow shock. We found that photoionized bow shocks are $\approx$15$-$50
times brighter in optical line emission than their neutral counterparts, from
which we conclude that the bow shock of IRC-10414 must be photoionized.

energy: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS3),
the Supernova Cosmology Project (Union2.1), and the Pan-STARRS1 survey (PS1);
cosmic microwave background measurements from Planck and WMAP9; and a

are consistent with $w = -1$ for the Union2.1 sample, though they present
moderate ($\sim 1.9\sigma$) evidence for a phantom value when either the SNLS3

the redshift, stretch, color, and host galaxy stellar mass of SNe, but we find
no unusual trends. In contrast, the constraints strongly depend on any external
$H_0$ prior: a higher adopted value for the direct measurement of the Hubble
constant ($H_0 \gtrsim 71~\text{km/s/Mpc}$) leads to $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ evidence

statement at $2\sigma$ confidence: either the SNLS3 and PS1 data have
systematics that remain unaccounted for or the Hubble constant is below 71

Several methods have been proposed to counter this difficulty, but their

which relies on the relation between the halo density and the decrease of the
bar pattern speed. The latter is routinely characterised by the ratio ${\cal
R}$ of the corotation radius $R_{CR}$ to the bar length $L_b$, ${\cal
R}=R_{CR}/L_b$. I use a set of $N$-body+SPH simulations, including sub-grid
physics, whose initial conditions cover a range of gas fractions and halo
shapes. The models, by construction, have roughly the same azimuthally averaged
circular velocity curve and halo density and they are all submaximal, i.e.
according to previous works they are expected to have all roughly the same
${\cal
  R}$ value, well outside the fast bar range (1.2 $\pm$ 0.2). Contrary to these
expectations, however, these simulations end up having widely different ${\cal
R}$ values, either within the fast bar range, or well outside it. This shows
that the ${\cal R}$ value can not constrain the halo density, nor determine
whether galactic discs are maximal or submaximal. I argue that this is true
even for early type discs (S0s and Sas).

inner radii launches a new type of transient outflow containing hot plasma

imaging by Spitzer/MIPS at 24um, in conjunction with Herschel 5-band imaging

693 galaxies at z=1.62 detected at 24um (10 spectroscopic and 683 photo-z)
includes both cluster galaxies (i.e. within r <1 Mpc projected clustercentric
radius) and field galaxies, defined as the region beyond a radius of 3 Mpc. The
star-formation rates (SFRs) derived from the measured infrared luminosity range
from 18 to 2500 Ms/yr, with a median of 55 Ms/yr, over the entire radial range
(10 Mpc). The cluster brightest FIR galaxy, taken as the centre of the galaxy
system, is vigorously forming stars at a rate of 256$\pm$70 Ms/yr, and the
total cluster SFR enclosed in a circle of 1 Mpc is 1161$\pm$96 Ms/yr. We
estimate a dust extinction of about 3 magnitudes by comparing the SFRs derived
from [OII] luminosity with the ones computed from the 24um fluxes. We find that
the in-falling region (1-3 Mpc) is special: there is a significant decrement
(3.5x) of passive relative to star-forming galaxies in this region, and the
total SFR of the galaxies located in this region is lower (130 Ms/yr/Mpc2) than
anywhere in the cluster or field, regardless of their stellar mass. In a
complementary approach we compute the local galaxy density, Sigma5, and find no
trend between SFR and Sigma5. However, we measure an excess of star-forming
galaxies in the cluster relative to the field by a factor 1.7, that lends
support to a reversal of the SF-density relation in CLG0218.

luminosity AGN are preferentially triggered by mergers. On the contrary, we
find that AGN likely trace over dense environments at high redshift due to the

metal-line cooling in addition to dust and self-shielding, $\mathrm{H_{2}}$
based star formation. The 4 simulated halos have masses ranging from a few
times $10^{10}$ to nearly $10^{12}$ solar masses. Using a kinematic
decomposition of these galaxies into present-day bulge and disk components, we
find that the typical pressure of the star-forming ISM in the present-day bulge
is higher than that in the present-day disk by an order of magnitude. We also
find that pressure of the star-forming ISM at high redshift is on average,
higher than ISM pressures at low redshift. This explains the why the bulge
forms at higher pressures: the disk assembles at lower redshift, when the ISM
is lower pressure and the bulge forms at high redshift, when the ISM is at
higher pressure. If ISM pressure and IMF variation are tied together as
suggested in studies like \cite{Conroy2012}, these results could indicate a
time-dependent IMF in Milky-Way like systems, as well as a different IMF in the
bulge and the disk.

boundary-element method (BEM) of computational electromagnetism. To date,
practical implementation of BEM solvers has often required the aggregation of
multiple disparate integral-evaluation schemes to treat all of the distinct

significant generalization of the Taylor--Duffy approach
\cite{Taylor2003,Duffy1982}, which was originally presented for just a single
type of integrand; in addition to generalizing this technique to a broad class
of integrands, we also achieve a significant improvement in its efficiency by
showing how the \emph{dimension} of the final numerical integral may often be
reduced by one. In particular, if $n$ is the number of common vertices between
the two triangles, in many cases we can reduce the dimension of the integral
from $4-n$ to $3-n$, obtaining a closed-form analytical result for $n=3$ (the
common-triangle case).

iteratively swaps variables until convergence. SWAP is surprisingly effective
in handling measurement matrices with high correlations. In fact, we prove that
SWAP outputs the true support, the locations of the non-zero entries in the
sparse vector, under a relatively mild condition on the measurement matrix.
Furthermore, we show that SWAP can be used to boost the performance of any

failure, we compute the energetics of a Co chain on a Cu surface, step, notch,

extinguishes the dimerization, indicating that the failure of DFT for Co on the
Cu step arises from excessive hybridization, which both weakens the
ferromagnetic correlations that drive the dimerization and increases the
bonding that opposes dimerization. Additionally, we show that including local
interactions via DFT+U or DFT+DMFT does not restore the dimerization for the
step-substrate supported wire, though the Co wire does dimerize in DFT+DMFT for
the isolated vacuum case. This system can serve as a benchmark for future
electronic structure methods.

  In this paper, we characterize upper semicomputable sumtests relative to any
lower semicomputable semimeasures using Kolmogorov complexity. It is studied to
what extend such tests are pathological: can upper semicomputable sumtests for
$m(x)$ be large? It is shown that the logarithm of such tests does not exceed
$\log |x| + O(\log^{(2)} |x|)$ (where $|x|$ denotes the length of $x$ and
$\log^{(2)} = \log\log$) and that this bound is tight, i.e. there is a test
whose logarithm exceeds $\log |x| - O(\log^{(2)} |x|$) infinitely often.
Finally, it is shown that for each such test $e$ the mutual information of a

of structure in the universe, there exists a tight connection between the
properties of dark matter (DM) haloes, and their formation epochs. Such
relation can be expressed in terms of a single key parameter, namely the halo
concentration. In this work, we examine the median concentration-mass relation,
c(M), at present time, over more than 20 orders of magnitude in halo mass,
i.e., from tiny Earth-mass microhalos up to galaxy clusters. The c(M) model
proposed by Prada et al. (2012), which links the halo concentration with the
r.m.s. amplitude of matter linear fluctuations, describes remarkably well all
the available N-body simulation data down to ~10^(-6) Msun microhalos. A clear
fattening of the halo concentration-mass relation towards smaller masses is
observed, that excludes the commonly adopted power-law c(M) models, and stands
as a natural prediction for the CDM paradigm. We provide a parametrization for
the c(M) relation that works accurately for all halo masses. This feature in
the c(M) relation at low masses has decisive consequences e.g. for gamma-ray DM
searches, as it implies more modest boosts of the DM annihilation flux due to
substructure, i.e., ~35 for galaxy clusters and ~15 for galaxies like our own,
as compared to those huge values adopted in the literature that rely on such
power-law c(M) extrapolations. We provide a parametrization of the boosts that
can be safely used for dwarfs to galaxy cluster-size halos.

regularization, as demonstrated empirically in Amini et. al (2012). Here, we
provide an attempt at quantifying this improvement through theoretical
analysis. Under the stochastic block model (SBM), and its extensions, previous
results on spectral clustering relied on the minimum degree of the graph being
sufficiently large for its good performance. By examining the scenario where
the regularization parameter $\tau$ is large we show that the minimum degree
assumption can potentially be removed. As a special case, for an SBM with two
blocks, the results require the maximum degree to be large (grow faster than
$\log n$) as opposed to the minimum degree.
  More importantly, we show the usefulness of regularization in situations
where not all nodes belong to well-defined clusters. Our results rely on a
`bias-variance'-like trade-off that arises from understanding the concentration
of the sample Laplacian and the eigen gap as a function of the regularization
parameter. As a byproduct of our bounds, we propose a data-driven technique
\textit{DKest} (standing for estimated Davis-Kahan bounds) for choosing the
regularization parameter. This technique is shown to work well through
simulations and on a real data set.

comparable to the scale of spatial variations of laser intensity, we pay
special attention to averaging optical fields over the atomic wavefunctions.
Optical potential is proportional to the ac Stark polarizability. We find that
in the independent particle approximation for the valence electrons, this
polarizability breaks into two contributions: the singly ionized core
polarizability and the contribution from the Rydberg electron. Unlike the
usually employed free electron polarizability, the Rydberg contribution depends
both on laser intensity profile and the rotational symmetry of the total
electronic wavefunction. We focus on the $J=0$ Rydberg states of Sr and
evaluate the dynamic polarizabilities of the 5s$n$s($^1S_0$) and
5s$n$p($^3P_0$) Rydberg states. We specifically choose Sr atom for its optical
lattice clock applications. We find that there are several magic wavelengths in
the infrared region of the spectrum at which the differential Stark shift
between the clock states (5s$^2$($^1S_0$) and 5s5p($^3P_0$)) and the $J=0$
Rydberg states, 5s$n$s($^1S_0$) and 5s$n$p($^3P_0$), vanishes. We tabulate
these wavelengths as a function of the principal quantum number $n$ of the
Rydberg electron. We find that because the contribution to the total
polarizability from the Rydberg electron vanishes at short wavelengths, magic
wavelengths below $\sim$1000 nm are ``universal"" as they do not depend on the

quantum states are defined from a natural decomposition as an outer-product of
a topological state, dictating the topology of the two-surfaces of the
space-time, and a geometric state, which controls the geometry and is comprised
of solutions to the Wheeler-DeWitt constraints. Within this symmetry reduced
theory an eigenvalue equation is derived for the two-volume of spacetime, which
for spherical topology is fixed to a value of $4\pi$. However, for the other
topologies it is found that the spectrum can be \emph{discrete} and hence the
universe, if in one of these other topological states, may only possess certain
possible values for the two-volume, whereas classically all values are allowed.
We analyze this result in the context of pure gravity (black holes).

SVMs, SVM regression, and structural SVMs) from large, out-of-core training
datasets. Current strategies for large-scale learning fall into one of two
camps; batch algorithms which solve the learning problem given a finite
datasets, and online algorithms which can process out-of-core datasets. The
former typically requires datasets small enough to fit in memory. The latter is
often phrased as a stochastic optimization problem; such algorithms enjoy
strong theoretical properties but often require manual tuned annealing
schedules, and may converge slowly for problems with large output spaces (e.g.,
structural SVMs). We discuss an algorithm for an ""intermediate"" regime in which
the data is too large to fit in memory, but the active constraints (support
vectors) are small enough to remain in memory. In this case, one can design
rather efficient learning algorithms that are as stable as batch algorithms,
but capable of processing out-of-core datasets. We have developed such a
MATLAB-based solver and used it to train a collection of recognition systems
for articulated pose estimation, facial analysis, 3D object recognition, and
action classification, all with publicly-available code. This writeup describes

be applied throughout the entire nuclear landscape. Its key ingredient is the
energy density functional. In this work, we propose a new parameterization
UNEDF2 of the Skyrme energy density functional. The functional optimization is
carried out using the POUNDerS optimization algorithm within the framework of
the Skyrme Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory. Compared to the previous
parameterization UNEDF1, restrictions on the tensor term of the energy density
have been lifted, yielding a very general form of the energy density functional
up to second order in derivatives of the one-body density matrix. In order to
impose constraints on all the parameters of the functional, selected data on
single-particle splittings in spherical doubly-magic nuclei have been included
into the experimental dataset. The agreement with both bulk and spectroscopic
nuclear properties achieved by the resulting UNEDF2 parameterization is
comparable with UNEDF1. While there is a small improvement on single-particle
spectra and binding energies of closed shell nuclei, the reproduction of
fission barriers and fission isomer excitation energies has degraded. As
compared to previous UNEDF parameterizations, the parameter confidence interval
for UNEDF2 is narrower. In particular, our results overlap well with those
obtained in previous systematic studies of the spin-orbit and tensor terms.
UNEDF2 can be viewed as an all-around Skyrme EDF that performs reasonably well
for both global nuclear properties and shell structure. However, after adding
new data aiming to better constrain the nuclear functional, its quality has
improved only marginally. These results suggest that the standard Skyrme energy
density has reached its limits and significant changes to the form of the
functional are needed.

recently. One of the most important of these algorithms is particle swarm
optimization (PSO). PSO is based on the collective intelligence of a swam of
particles. Each particle explores a part of the search space looking for the
optimal position and adjusts its position according to two factors; the first
is its own experience and the second is the collective experience of the whole
swarm. PSO has been successfully used to solve many optimization problems. In
this work we use PSO to improve the performance of a well-known representation
method of time series data which is the symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX).
As with other time series representation methods, SAX results in loss of
information when applied to represent time series. In this paper we use PSO to
propose a new minimum distance WMD for SAX to remedy this problem. Unlike the
original minimum distance, the new distance sets different weights to different
segments of the time series according to their information content. This
weighted minimum distance enhances the performance of SAX as we show through
experiments using different time series datasets.

result for general groups. In this work, we show the first improvement over the
generator-enumeration bound for p-groups, which are believed to be the hard
case of the group isomorphism problem. We start by giving a Turing reduction
from group isomorphism to n^((1 / 2) log_p n + O(1)) instances of p-group
composition-series isomorphism. By showing a Karp reduction from p-group
composition-series isomorphism to testing isomorphism of graphs of degree at

for p-group isomorphism that takes at most n^((1 / 2) log_p n + O(p)) time.
This algorithm is faster than generator-enumeration when p is small and slower
when p is large. Choosing the faster algorithm based on p and n yields an upper
bound of n^((1 / 2 + o(1)) log n) for p-group isomorphism.

propose a joint energy and spectrum cooperation scheme between different
cellular systems to reduce their operational costs. When the two systems are
fully cooperative in nature (e.g., belonging to the same entity), we formulate
the cooperation problem as a convex optimization problem to minimize their

another partially cooperative scenario where the two systems have their own

they find inter-system complementarity between the energy and spectrum
resources. Under the partial cooperation conditions, we propose a distributed
algorithm for the two systems to gradually and simultaneously reduce their
costs from the non-cooperative benchmark to the Pareto optimum. This
distributed algorithm also has proportional fair cost reduction by reducing
each system's cost proportionally over iterations. Finally, we provide
numerical results to validate the convergence of the distributed algorithm to

spectroscopic surveys, such as GALAH and the Gaia-ESO survey, will represent
major milestones in the quest to chemically tag the Galaxy. Yet this technique
to reconstruct dispersed coeval stellar groups has remained largely untested
until recently. We build on previous work that developed an empirical chemical
tagging probability function, which describes the likelihood that two field
stars are conatal, that is, they were formed in the same cluster environment.
In this work we perform the first ever blind chemical tagging experiment, i.e.,
tagging stars with no known or otherwise discernable associations, on a sample
of 714 disc field stars with a number of high quality high resolution
homogeneous metal abundance measurements. We present evidence that chemical
tagging of field stars does identify coeval groups of stars, yet these groups
may not represent distinct formation sites, e.g. as in dissolved open clusters,
as previously thought. Our results point to several important conclusions,
among them that group finding will be limited strictly to chemical abundance
space, e.g. stellar ages, kinematics, colors, temperature and surface gravity
do not enhance the detectability of groups. We also demonstrate that in
addition to its role in probing the chemical enrichment and kinematic history
of the Galactic disc, chemical tagging represents a powerful new stellar age
determination technique.

  Decoding","preliminary version",,,,"cs.DS cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study coding schemes for error correction in interactive communications.
Such interactive coding schemes simulate any $n$-round interactive protocol
using $N$ rounds over an adversarial channel that corrupts up to $\rho N$
transmissions. Important performance measures for a coding scheme are its
maximum tolerable error rate $\rho$, communication complexity $N$, and
computational complexity.
  We give the first coding scheme for the standard setting which performs
optimally in all three measures: Our randomized non-adaptive coding scheme has
a near-linear computational complexity and tolerates any error rate $\delta <
1/4$ with a linear $N = \Theta(n)$ communication complexity. This improves over
prior results which each performed well in two of these measures.
  We also give results for other settings of interest, namely, the first
computationally and communication efficient schemes that tolerate $\rho <
\frac{2}{7}$ adaptively, $\rho < \frac{1}{3}$ if only one party is required to
decode, and $\rho < \frac{1}{2}$ if list decoding is allowed. These are the
optimal tolerable error rates for the respective settings. These coding schemes
also have near linear computational and communication complexity.
  These results are obtained via two techniques: We give a general black-box
reduction which reduces unique decoding, in various settings, to list decoding.
We also show how to boost the computational and communication efficiency of any
list decoder to become near linear.

  Most significantly, we explore adaptive interactive communication where the
communicating parties decide who should speak next based on the history of the
interaction. Braverman and Rao [STOC'11] show that non-adaptively one can code
for any constant error rate below 1/4 but not more. They asked whether this
bound could be improved using adaptivity. We answer this open question in the
affirmative (with a slightly different collection of resources): Our adaptive
coding scheme tolerates any error rate below 2/7 and we show that tolerating a
higher error rate than 1/3 is impossible. We also show that in the setting of
Franklin et al. [CRYPTO'13], where parties share randomness not known to the
adversary, adaptivity increases the tolerable error rate from 1/2 to 2/3. For
list-decodable interactive communications, where each party outputs a constant
size list of possible outcomes, the tight tolerable error rate is 1/2.
  Our negative results hold even for unbounded communication and computations,
whereas for our positive results communication and computations are
polynomially bounded. Most prior work considered coding schemes with linear
amount of communication, while allowing unbounded computations. We argue that
studying tolerable error rates in this relaxed context helps to identify a
setting's intrinsic optimal error rate. We set forward a strong working
hypothesis which stipulates that for any setting the maximum tolerable error
rate is independent of many computational and communication complexity
measures. We believe this hypothesis to be a powerful guideline for the design
of simple, natural, and efficient coding schemes and for understanding the
(im)possibilities of coding for interactive communications.

goal in evolutionary biology. Much work has shown that mRNA abundance is highly
variable between closely related species. However, the extent and mechanisms of
post-transcriptional gene regulatory evolution are largely unknown. Here we
used ribosome profiling to compare transcript abundance and translation
efficiency in two closely related yeast species (S. cerevisiae and S.
paradoxus). By comparing translation regulatory divergence to interspecies
differences in mRNA sequence features, we show that differences in transcript
leaders and codon bias substantially contribute to divergent translation.
Globally, we find that translation regulatory divergence often buffers
species-differences in mRNA abundance, such that ribosome occupancy is more
conserved than transcript abundance. We used allele-specific ribosome profiling
in interspecies hybrids to compare the relative contributions of cis- and
trans-regulatory divergence to species differences in mRNA abundance and
translation efficiency. The mode of gene regulatory divergence differs for
these processes, as trans-regulatory changes play a greater role in divergent
mRNA abundance than in divergent translation efficiency. Strikingly, most genes
with aberrant transcript abundance in F1 hybrids (either over- or
under-expressed compared to both parent species) did not exhibit aberrant
ribosome occupancy. Our results show that interspecies differences in
translation contribute substantially to the evolution of gene expression.
Compensatory differences in transcript abundance and translation efficiency may
increase the robustness of gene regulation.

operations are usually more complicated compared to their vector counterparts.
In order to overcome the high complexity resulting from matrix variables, in

problems, namely matrix-monotonic optimization problems (MMOPs). In our work,
various representative MIMO optimization problems are unified into a framework

nonlinear transceiver design, training sequence design, radar waveform
optimization, the corresponding robust design and so on as its special cases.
Then exploiting the framework of matrix-monotonic optimization the optimal
structures of the considered matrix variables can be derived first. Based on
the optimal structure, the matrix-variate optimization problems can be greatly
simplified into the ones with only vector variables. In particular, the
dimension of the new vector variable is equal to the minimum number of columns
and rows of the original matrix variable. Finally, we also extend our work to
some more general cases with multiple matrix variables.

between a sphere and a plate in $(D+1)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. It is
assumed that the scalar field satisfies the Dirichlet or Neumann boundary
conditions on the sphere and the plate. As in the $D=3$ case, the formula is of
TGTG type. One of our main contributions is deriving the translation matrices
which express the change of bases between plane waves and spherical waves for
general $D$. Using orthogonality of Gegenbauer polynomials, it turns out that
the final TGTG formula for the Casimir interaction energy can be simplified to
one that is similar to the $D=3$ case. To illustrate the application of the
formula, both large separation and small separation asymptotic behaviors of the
Casimir interaction energy are computed. The large separation leading term is
proportional to $L^{-D+1}$ if the sphere is imposed with Dirichlet boundary
condition, and to $L^{-D-1}$ if the sphere is imposed with Neumann boundary
condition, where $L$ is distance from the center of the sphere to the plane.
For the small separation asymptotic behavior, it is shown that the leading term
is equal to the one obtained using proximity force approximation. The
next-to-leading order term is also computed using perturbation method. It is
shown that when the space dimension $D$ is larger than 5, the next-to-leading
order has sign opposite to the leading order term. Moreover, the ratio of the
next-to-leading order term to the leading order term is linear in $D$,

Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data release 9 (DR9) provided by the Max Planck
Institute and the Johns Hopkins University (MPA/JHU). A two-step approach is
adopted:(i) The ANN network must be trained with a subset of objects that are
known to be either MPGs or MRGs(Metal Rich galaxies), treating the strong
emission line flux measurements as input feature vectors in an n-dimensional
space, where n is the number of strong emission line flux ratios. (ii) After
the network is trained on a sample of star-forming galaxies, remaining galaxies
are classified in the automatic test analysis as either MPGs or MRGs. We
consider several random divisions of the data into training and testing sets:
for instance, for our sample, a total of 70 percent of the data are involved in
training the algorithm, 15 percent are involved in validating the algorithm and
the remaining 15 percent are used for blind testing of the resulting
classifier.
  For target selection, we have achieved an acquisition rate for MPGs of 96
percent and 92 percent for an MPGs threshold of 12+log(O/H)=8.00 and
12+log(O/H)=8.39, respectively.
  Running the code takes minutes in most cases under the Matlab 2013a software
environment.
  The ANN method can easily be extended to any MPGs target selection task when
the physical property of the target can be expressed as a quantitative
variable.

explained by the galaxy's properties, such as the 4000 {\AA} break.

rather than solid spheres. A number of previous studies have used highly
sophisticated schemes to calculate opacity models for irregular, porous
particles with size much smaller than a wavelength. However, mere growth itself
can affect the opacity of the medium in far more significant ways than the
detailed compositional and/or structural differences between grain constituents

suitably chosen transitions to geometric optics behavior. Calculations of

equivalent or even better finite-length performance than the turbo/LDPC codes
under some improved decoding algorithms over the additive white Gaussian noise
(AWGN) channels. Polar coding is based on the so-called channel polarization
phenomenon induced by a transform over the underlying binary-input channel. The
channel polarization is found to be universal in many signal processing
problems and has been applied to the coded modulation schemes. In this paper,
the channel polarization is further extended to the multiple antenna
transmission following a multilevel coding principle. The multiple-input
multile-output (MIMO) channel under quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) are
transformed into a series of synthesized binary-input channels under a
three-stage channel transform. Based on this generalized channel polarization,
the proposed space-time polar coded modulation (STPCM) scheme allows a joint
optimization of the binary polar coding, modulation and MIMO transmission. In
addition, a practical solution of polar code construction over the fading
channels is also provided, where the fading channels are approximated by an
AWGN channel which shares the same capacity with the original. The simulations
over the MIMO channel with uncorrelated Rayleigh fast fading show that the
proposed STPCM scheme can outperform the bit-interleaved turbo coded scheme in
all the simulated cases, where the latter is adopted in many existing
communication systems.

However, evolutionary biologists gain important insights from these low
variation directions. Specifically, they are interested in directions of low

and has important implications across prevention, diagnosis and treatment.
Cancer sequencing studies aim at discovering genes with high frequencies of
somatic mutations in specific types of cancer, as these genes are potential
driving factors (drivers) for cancer development. We introduce a hierarchical
Bayesian methodology to estimate gene-specific mutation rates and driver
probabilities from somatic mutation data and to shed light on the overall
proportion of drivers among sequenced genes. Our methodology applies to
different experimental designs used in practice, including one-stage, two-stage
and candidate gene designs. Also, sample sizes are typically small relative to
the rarity of individual mutations. Via a shrinkage method borrowing strength
from the whole genome in assessing individual genes, we reinforce inference and
address the selection effects induced by multistage designs. Our simulation
studies show that the posterior driver probabilities provide a nearly unbiased
false discovery rate estimate. We apply our methods to pancreatic and breast
cancer data, contrast our results to previous estimates and provide estimated
proportions of drivers for these two types of cancer.

and has been linked to respiratory and cardiovascular endpoints and adverse
effects on vegetation and ecosystems. Regional photochemical models have been
developed to study the impacts of emission reductions on ozone levels. The
standard approach is to run the deterministic model under new emission levels
and attribute the change in ozone concentration to the emission control
strategy. However, running the deterministic model requires substantial
computing time, and this approach does not provide a measure of uncertainty for
the change in ozone levels. Recently, a reduced form model (RFM) has been
proposed to approximate the complex model as a simple function of a few
relevant inputs. In this paper, we develop a new statistical approach to make
full use of the RFM to study the effects of various control strategies on the
probability and magnitude of extreme ozone events. We fuse the model output
with monitoring data to calibrate the RFM by modeling the conditional
distribution of monitoring data given the RFM using a combination of flexible
semiparametric quantile regression for the center of the distribution where
data are abundant and a parametric extreme value distribution for the tail
where data are sparse. Selected parameters in the conditional distribution are
allowed to vary by the RFM value and the spatial location. Also, due to the
simplicity of the RFM, we are able to embed the RFM in our Bayesian
hierarchical framework to obtain a full posterior for the model input
parameters, and propagate this uncertainty to the estimation of the effects of
the control strategies. We use the new framework to evaluate three potential
control strategies, and find that reducing mobile-source emissions has a larger
impact than reducing point-source emissions or a combination of several
emission sources.

leading to a method for the characterization of Young measures generated by

are particularly important in the theories of elasticity and fluid dynamics:
(a) the generating gradients have positive Jacobians that are uniformly bounded
away from zero and (b) the underlying deformations are incompressible,

characterization result, along with its various corollaries, underlines the
flexibility of the Jacobian determinant in subcritical Sobolev spaces and gives
a more systematic and general perspective on previously known pathologies of
the pointwise Jacobian. Finally, we show that, for $p$ less than the dimension,
$W^{1,p}$-quasiconvexity and $W^{1,p}$-orientation-preserving quasiconvexity

X-ray Binaries (LMXB). We find a dramatic transition at a luminosity of 1 -
2.10^{37} erg/s above which the high energy cut-off E_CO of the Comptonized
emission in all sources is low at a few keV. There is thermal equilibrium
between the neutron star at ~2 keV and the Comptonizing accretion disk corona
(ADC) causing the low E_CO in the Banana state of Atolls and all states of the
Z-track sources. Below this luminosity, E_CO increases towards 100 keV causing
the hardness of the island state. Thermal equilibrium is lost, the ADC becoming
much hotter than the neutron star via an additional coronal heating mechanism.
This suggests a unified model of LMXB: the Banana state is a basic state with
the mass accretion rate Mdot increasing, corresponding to the Normal Branch of
Z-track sources. The Island state has high ADC temperature, this state not
existing in the Z-track sources with luminosities much greater than the
critical value. The Z-track sources have an additional flaring branch
consistent with unstable nuclear burning on the neutron star at high Mdot. This
burning regime does not exist at low Mdot so this branch is not seen in Atolls
(except GX Atolls). The Horizontal Branch in Z-track sources has a strong
increase in radiation pressure disrupting the inner disk and launching
relativistic jets.

in mind, we point out the \emph{model-independent} procedure related to
cosmography, showing how to match the series of cosmological observables to the
free parameters of each model. We critically discuss the role played by
cosmography, as a \emph{selection criterion} to check whether a particular
model passes or does not present cosmological constraints. In so doing, we find
out cosmological bounds by fitting the luminosity distance expansion of the
redshift, z, adopting the recent Union 2.1 dataset of supernovae, combined with
the baryonic acoustic oscillation and the cosmic microwave background
measurements. We perform cosmographic analyses, imposing different priors on
the Hubble rate present value. In addition, we compare our results with recent
PLANCK limits, showing that the $\Lambda$CDM and $\omega$CDM models seem to be
the favorite with respect to other dark energy models. However, we show that

stepping-stone to understanding general arithmetic circuits. Its restriction to
multilinearity has known exponential lower bounds but no nontrivial blackbox
identity tests. In this paper we take a step towards designing such
hitting-sets. We define a notion of distance for multilinear depth-$3$ circuits
(say, in $n$ variables and $k$ product gates) that measures how far are the
partitions from a mere refinement. The $1$-distance strictly subsumes the
set-multilinear model, while $n$-distance captures general multilinear
depth-$3$. We design a hitting-set in time poly($n^{\delta\log k}$) for
$\delta$-distance. Further, we give an extension of our result to models where
the distance is large (close to $n$) but it is small when restricted to certain
variables. This implies the first subexponential whitebox PIT for the sum of
constantly many set-multilinear depth-$3$ circuits.
  We also explore a new model of read-once algebraic branching programs (ROABP)
where the factor-matrices are invertible (called invertible-factor ROABP). We
design a hitting-set in time poly($\text{size}^{w^2}$) for width-$w$
invertible-factor ROABP. Further, we could do without the invertibility
restriction when $w=2$. Previously, the best result for width-$2$ ROABP was
quasi-polynomial time (Forbes-Saptharishi-Shpilka, arXiv 2013).
  The common thread in all these results is the phenomenon of low-support `rank
concentration'. We exploit the structure of these models to prove
rank-concentration after a `small shift' in the variables. Our proof techniques
are stronger than the results of Agrawal-Saha-Saxena (STOC 2013) and
Forbes-Saptharishi-Shpilka (arXiv 2013); giving us quasi-polynomial-time
hitting-sets for models where no subexponential whitebox algorithms were known
before.

specific numerical values associated with them. This setting is relevant when
agents can compare outcomes, but aren't able to evaluate precise utilities for
them. Such a situation arises in diverse contexts including voting and matching
markets.
  Our paper addresses two issues that arise in ordinal mechanism design. To
design social welfare maximizing mechanisms, one needs to be able to
quantitatively measure the welfare of an outcome which is not clear in the
ordinal setting. Second, since the impossibility results of Gibbard and
Satterthwaite~\cite{Gibbard73,Satterthwaite75} force one to move to randomized
mechanisms, one needs a more nuanced notion of truthfulness.
  We propose {\em rank approximation} as a metric for measuring the quality of
an outcome, which allows us to evaluate mechanisms based on worst-case
performance, and {\em lex-truthfulness} as a notion of truthfulness for
randomized ordinal mechanisms. Lex-truthfulness is stronger than notions
studied in the literature, and yet flexible enough to admit a rich class of
mechanisms {\em circumventing classical impossibility results}. We demonstrate
the usefulness of the above notions by devising lex-truthful mechanisms
achieving good rank-approximation factors, both in the general ordinal setting,
as well as structured settings such as {\em (one-sided) matching markets}, and
its generalizations, {\em matroid} and {\em scheduling} markets.

remarkably assisted by external noise and quantum features as coherence. An
optimal mixing of classical and quantum transport is, very surprisingly, quite
universal for a large class of complex networks. This widespread behaviour

Notwithstanding, a mechanistic understanding of the fundamental principles

analysis is applied for the characterization of geometries that result in

the subtle relationship between transport and geometry. Investigating systems
with a different number of elementary units allows us to identify classes of
structures which are common to all system sizes and which possess distinct
robustness features. In particular, we find that small groups of two or three
sites closely packed together that do not carry excitation at any time are
fundamental to realize efficient and robust excitation transport. Features
identified in small systems recur also in larger systems, what suggests that
such strategy can efficiently be used to construct close-to-optimal transport

induced an extensive search for topological phase in strongly correlated
electron systems. In particular, samarium hexaboride (SmB$_6$) has drawn much
attention as it might represent a new class of condensed matter called
topological Kondo insulator. Kondo insulators (KI) can have non-trivial Z$_2$
topology because the energy gap opens at the Fermi energy ($E_F$) by
hybridization between an odd- parity renormalized $f$ band and an even- parity
conduction $d$ band. However, the characteristics of SmB$_6$ deviate from the
conventional KI because its gap is insensitive to doping and pressure. Thus, it
is unclear what makes the gap of SmB$_6$ different from that of KI, and how the
band inversion features occur. In this manuscript, we demonstrate the
importance of charge fluctuations in SmB$_6$. Our angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) results reveal that with decreasing temperature the bottom
of the $d$-$f$ hybridized band at the $\bar{\text{X}}$ point gradually shifts
from below to above $E_F$. This shift accompanies a redistribution of spectral
weight from the upper to the lower quasiparticle band, and reflects the change
in both carrier density and the number of localized $f$ electron. Moreover,
because this hybridized band is predicted to have odd parity and to induce a
non-trivial $Z_{2}$ topology, we compare our ARPES spectra with theoretical
surface band structures and find signatures of topological surface states.
Therefore, our results indicate that SmB$_6$ is a charge fluctuating
topological insulator having the odd-parity hybridized band above $E_F$ at the
$X$ point. This demonstrates that the charge fluctuations do not only drive the
insulating bulk phase but also the non-trivial topological phase.

B[e]SGs for the dynamics of the interstellar medium as well as stellar and
galactic chemical evolution. The number of objects and their mass loss behavior
at different metallicities are essential ingredients for accurate predictions
from stellar and galactic evolution calculations. However, B[e]SGs are not
easily identified, as they share many characteristics with luminous blue
variables (LBVs) in their quiescent (hot) phase. We present medium-resolution
near-infrared K-band spectra for four stars in M 31, which have been assigned a
hot LBV (candidate) status. Applying diagnostics that were recently developed
to distinguish B[e]SGs from hot LBVs, we classify two of the objects as
bonafide LBVs; one of them currently in outburst. In addition, we firmly
classify the two stars 2MASS J00441709+4119273 and 2MASS J00452257+4150346 as
the first B[e]SGs in M 31 based on strong CO band emission detected in their
spectra, and infrared colors typical for this class of stars.

a novel application to the alignment of protein domains. Here, scaling is
applied to secondary structure elements when comparing protein folds;

highlighted. In agreement with some previous claims in the literature, we find
that in a lattice regularization which respects gauge invariance, the chiral

transport coefficients to axial anomaly is nontrivial due to the
non-commutativity of their infrared limit and the Taylor expansion in baryon or

on the perturbative non-renormalization of the transverse part of the

from the 2011 LHC heavy-ion run. The data set includes a sample of
ultra-central (0-0.2% centrality) PbPb events collected using a trigger based
on total transverse energy in the hadron forward calorimeters and the total
multiplicity of pixel clusters in the silicon pixel tracker. A total of about
1.8 million ultra-central events were recorded, corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 120 inverse microbarns. The observed correlations in
ultra-central PbPb events are expected to be particularly sensitive to
initial-state fluctuations. The single-particle anisotropy Fourier harmonics,
from v[2] to v[6], are extracted as a function of particle transverse momentum.
At higher transverse momentum, the v[2] harmonic becomes significantly smaller
than the higher-order v[n] (n greater than or equal to 3). The pt-averaged v[2]
and v[3] are found to be equal within 2%, while higher-order v[n] decrease as n
increases. The breakdown of factorization of dihadron correlations into
single-particle azimuthal anisotropies is observed. This effect is found to be
most prominent in the ultra-central PbPb collisions, where the initial-state
fluctuations play a dominant role. A comparison of the factorization data to
hydrodynamic predictions with event-by-event fluctuating initial conditions is
also presented.

subject of a vibrant debate both from the observational and theoretical point
of view. In particular the amount and the nature of non-thermal plasma and of
the magnetic field energy density in clusters hosting radio halos is still
unclear. The aim of this paper is to derive an estimate of the pressure ratio X
between the non-thermal and thermal plasma in radio halo clusters that have
combined radio, X-ray and SZ effect observations. From the simultaneous
P_{1.4}-L_X and P_{1.4}-Y_{SZ} correlations for a sample of clusters observed
with Planck, we derive a correlation between Y_{SZ} and L_X that we use to
derive a value for X. This is possible since the Compton parameter Y_{SZ} is
proportional to the total plasma pressure in the cluster (that we characterize
as the sum of the thermal and non-thermal pressure) while the X-ray luminosity
L_X is proportional only to the thermal pressure of the intracluster plasma.
Our results indicate that the average (best fit) value of the pressure ratio in
a self-similar cluster formation model is X =0.55 \pm 0.05 in the case of an
isothermal beta-model with beta=2/3 and a core radius r_c = 0.3 R_{500} holding
on average for the cluster sample. We also show that the theoretical prediction
for the Y_{SZ}-L_X correlation in this model has a slope that is steeper than
the best fit value for the available data. The agreement with the data can be
recovered if the pressure ratio X decreases with increasing X-ray luminosity as
L_X^{-0.96}. We conclude that the available data on radio halo clusters
indicate a substantial amount of non-thermal pressure in cluster atmospheres
whose value must decrease with increasing X-ray luminosity, or increasing
cluster mass (temperature). (abridged)

appropriately. Many factors are involved in these decisions, including number
of layers, feature maps, kernel sizes, etc. Complicating this further is the
fact that each of these influence not only the numbers and dimensions of the

focus on assessing the independent contributions of three of these linked
variables: The numbers of layers, feature maps, and parameters. To accomplish
this, we employ a recursive convolutional network whose weights are tied
between layers; this allows us to vary each of the three factors in a
controlled setting. We find that while increasing the numbers of layers and
parameters each have clear benefit, the number of feature maps (and hence
dimensionality of the representation) appears ancillary, and finds most of its
benefit through the introduction of more weights. Our results (i) empirically
confirm the notion that adding layers alone increases computational power,
within the context of convolutional layers, and (ii) suggest that precise
sizing of convolutional feature map dimensions is itself of little concern;
more attention should be paid to the number of parameters in these layers

Uncertainty Principle---that is, the study of trade-offs between accuracy and
disturbance, or between accuracies in an approximate joint measurement on two
incompatible observables---has regained a lot of interest recently. Several
approaches have been proposed and debated. In this paper we consider Ozawa's
definitions for inaccuracies (as root-mean-square errors) in approximate joint
measurements, and study how these are constrained in different cases, whether
one specifies certain properties of the approximations---namely their standard
deviations and/or their bias---or not. Extending our previous work [C.
Branciard, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 110, 6742 (2013)], we derive new
error-trade-off relations, which we prove to be tight for pure states. We show
explicitly how all previously known relations for Ozawa's inaccuracies follow
from ours. While our relations are in general not tight for mixed states, we
show how these can be strengthened and how tight relations can still be
obtained in that case.

and evaluate Evolutionary Computing systems and methods over the past two
decades. There is however no literature on its program structures that are
systematically used for fitness improvement, the geometries of those structures
and their dynamics during optimization. This paper analyzes the Santa Fe Ant
Problem using a new phenotypic schema and landscape analysis based on executed
instruction sequences. For the first time we detail systematic structural
features that give high fitness and the evolutionary dynamics of such
structures. The new schema avoids variances due to introns. We develop a
phenotypic variation method that tests the new understanding of the landscape.
We also develop a modified function set that tests newly identified
synchronization constraints. We obtain favorable computational efforts compared
to those in the literature, on testing the new variation and function set on
both the Santa Fe Trail, and the more computationally demanding Los Altos
Trail. Our findings suggest that for the Santa Fe Ant problem, a perspective of
program assembly from repetition of highly fit responses to trail conditions
leads to better analysis and performance.

in the information carried by gravitational waves between the total rest-frame
mass $M$ and the redshift $z$ of the source implies that neither can be
directly extracted from the signal, but only the combination $M(1+z)$, the
redshifted mass. Recent work has shown that for binary neutron star systems, a
tidal correction to the gravitational-wave phase in the late-inspiral signal
that depends on the rest-frame source mass could be used to break the
mass-redshift degeneracy. We propose here to use the signature encoded in the
post-merger signal to deduce the redshift to the source. This will allow an
accurate extraction of the intrinsic rest-frame mass of the source, in turn
permitting the determination of source redshift and luminosity distance solely
from gravitational-wave observations. This will herald a new era in precision
cosmography and astrophysics. Using numerical simulations of binary neutron
star mergers of very slightly different mass, we model gravitational-wave
signals at different redshifts and use Bayesian parameter estimation to
determine the accuracy with which the redshift can be extracted for a source of
known mass. We find that the Einstein Telescope can determine the source
redshift to $sim 10$--$20%$ at redshifts of $z<0.04$.

In addition to these indices, we utilize various solar wind plasma and field

tackle two crucial issues, namely the huge computational complexity and large

zero-forcing multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) is energy
inefficient if there is nonnegligible overhead power consumption on MU-MIMO
processing, and ii) increasing the number of antennas does not necessarily
result in a high EE. Furthermore, the results validate and underpin the EE

currents of arbitrary amplitudes and frequency at finite temperature is
theoretically investigated. The problem is considered in the single-vortex
approximation, relying upon the exact solution of the Langevin equation in
terms of a matrix continued fraction. The dc voltage response and the absorbed
power in ac response are analyzed as functions of dc bias, ac current amplitude
and frequency, in a wide range of corresponding dimensionless parameters.
Predictions are made of (i) a reversal of the rectified voltage at small dc
biases and strong ac drives and (ii) a non-monotonic enhancement of the
absorbed power in the nonlinear ac response at far sub-depinning frequencies.
It is elucidated how and why both these effects appear due to the competition
of the fixed internal and the tunable, dc bias-induced external asymmetry of
the potential as the only reason. This is distinct from other scenarios used
for explaining the vortex ratchet reversal effect so far.

profiles observed in the infrared Fe i line at 15648 angstrom. The regular
sunspot consisted of a light bridge which separated the two umbral cores of the
same polarity. One of the arms of the light bridge formed an extension of a
penumbral filament which comprised weak and highly inclined magnetic fields. In
addition, the Stokes V profiles in this filament had an opposite sign as the
sunspot and some resembled Stokes Q or U. This penumbral filament terminated
abruptly into another at the edge of the sunspot, where the latter was
relatively vertical by about 30 degrees. Chromospheric H-alpha and He 304
angstrom filtergrams revealed three superpenumbral fibrils on the limb-side of
the sunspot, in which one fibril extended into the sunspot and was oriented
along the highly inclined penumbral counterpart of the light bridge. An
intense, elongated brightening was observed along this fibril that was
co-spatial with the intersecting penumbral filaments in the photosphere. Our
results suggest that the disruption in the sunspot magnetic field at the
location of the light bridge could be the source of reconnection that led to
the intense chromospheric brightening and facilitated the supply of cool
material in maintaining the overlying superpenumbral fibrils.

hot spot formation were considered, namely hydrogen-oxygen and methane-oxygen.
It was shown that the methane mixture sustained turbulent fast flames, while
the hydrogen mixture did not. Detailed high speed visualizations of nearly
two-dimensional flow fields permitted to identify the key mechanism involved.
The strong vorticity generation associated with shock reflections in methane
permitted to drive jets. These provided local enhancement of mixing rates,
sustenance of pressure waves, organization of the front in stronger fewer modes
and eventually the transition to detonation. In the hydrogen system, for
similar thermo-chemical parameters, the absence of these jets did not permit to
establish such fast flames. This jetting slip line instability in shock
reflections (and lack thereof in hydrogen) was correlated with the value of the
isentropic exponent and its control of Mach shock jetting instability (Mach &

integral representation of the canonical theory is given. Using it, the salient
results of the extremely correlated Fermi liquid (ECFL) theory, including the
previously found Schwinger equations of motion, are easily rederived. Further a
transparent physical interpretation of the previously introduced auxiliary
Greens functions and the caparison factor is obtained.
  The low energy electron spectral function in this theory with a strong
intrinsic asymmetry, is summarized in terms of a few expansion coefficients.
These include an important emergent energy scale $\Delta_0$ that shrinks to
zero on approaching the insulating state, thereby making it difficult to access
the underlying low energy Fermi liquid behavior. The scaled low frequency ECFL
spectral function is related simply to the Fano line shape. The resulting
energy dispersion (EDC or MDC) is a hybrid of a massive and a massless Dirac
spectrum $ E^*_Q\sim \gamma\, Q- \sqrt{\Gamma_0^2 + Q^2} $, where the vanishing
of $Q$, a momentum like variable, locates the kink. Therefore the quasiparticle
velocity interpolates between $(\gamma \mp 1)$ over a width $\Gamma_0$ on the
two sides of $Q=0$. The resulting kink strongly resembles a prominent low
energy feature seen in angle resolved photoemission spectra (ARPES) of cuprate
materials. We also propose novel ways of analyzing the ARPES data to isolate

suited to many modern statistical regression problems. Many such tree models
have been proposed, from the simple single- tree model to more complex tree
ensembles. Their non-parametric formulation allows for effective and efficient
modeling of datasets exhibiting complex non-linear relationships between the
model pre- dictors and observations. However, the mixing behavior of the Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler is sometimes poor. This is because the
proposals in the sampler are typically local alterations of the tree structure,
such as the birth/death of leaf nodes, which does not allow for efficient
traversal of the model space. This poor mixing can lead to inferential
problems, such as under-representing uncertainty. In this paper, we develop
novel proposal mechanisms for efficient sampling. The first is a rule
perturbation proposal while the second we call tree rotation. The perturbation
proposal can be seen as an efficient variation of the change proposal found in
existing literature. The novel tree rotation proposal is simple to implement as
it only requires local changes to the regression tree structure, yet it
efficiently traverses disparate regions of the model space along contours of
equal probability. When combined with the classical birth/death proposal, the
resulting MCMC sampler exhibits good acceptance rates and properly represents
model uncertainty in the posterior samples. We implement this sampling
algorithm in the Bayesian Additive Regression Tree (BART) model and demonstrate
its effectiveness on a prediction problem from computer experiments and a test
function where structural tree variability is needed to fully explore the
posterior.

from isothermal cores in turbulent clumps. Their mass accretion rate is similar
to Shu accretion at low mass, and to reduced Bondi accretion at high mass.
Accretion durations follow a simple expression in which higher-mass protostars
accrete for longer times. These times are set by ejections, stellar feedback,
and gravitational competition, which terminate accretion and reduce its
efficiency. The mass scale is the mass of a critically stable isothermal core.
In steady state, the PMF approaches a power law at high mass due to competition
between clump accretion and accretion stopping. The power law exponent is the
ratio of the time scales of accretion and accretion stopping. The luminosity
function (PLF) peaks near 1 L_Sun, due to inefficient accretion of core gas.
Models fit observed PLFs in four large embedded clusters. These indicate that
their underlying PMFs may be top-heavy compared to the IMF, depending on the
model of protostar radius.

cosmic-ray intensity (CRI) on the solar and heliospheric parameters playing a
significant role in solar modulation. We utilize the data for cosmic-ray
intensity as measured by neutron monitors, solar activity as measured by
sunspot number (SSN), interplanetary plasma/field parameters, solar-wind
velocity [V] and magnetic field [B], as well as the tilt of the heliospheric
current sheet [{\Lambda}] and analyse these data for Solar Cycles 20 - 24 (1965
- 2011). We divide individual Solar Cycles into four phases, i.e. low, high,
increasing, and decreasing solar activity. We perform regression analysis to
calculate and compare the CRI-response to changes in different
solar/interplanetary parameters during (i) different phases of solar activity
and (ii) similar activity phases but different polarity states. We find that
the CRI-response is different during negative (A<0) as compared to positive
(A>0) polarity states not only with SSN and {\Lambda} but also with B and V.
The relative CRI-response to changes in various parameters, in negative (A<0)
as compared to positive (A>0) state, is solar-activity dependent; it is ~2 to 3
times higher in low solar activity, ~1.5 to 2 times higher in moderate
(increasing/decreasing) activity, and it is nearly equal in high solar-activity
conditions. Although our results can be ascribed to preferential entry of
charged particles via the equatorial/polar regions of the heliosphere as
predicted by drift models, these results also suggest that we should look for,
any polarity-dependent response of solar wind and transport parameters in
modulating CRI in the heliosphere.

Regression analysis using these data at different phases of solar activity
(increasing including maximum/decreasing including minimum) led us to suggest
that the time variation of interplanetary electric potential is a better
coupling function for solar wind-magnetosphere coupling. We suspect that a
faster rate of change in interplanetary electric potential at the magnetopause
might enhance the reconnection rate and energy transfer from the solar wind
into the magnetosphere. The possible mechanism that involves the interplanetary
potential fluctuations in influencing the solar wind-magnetosphere coupling is
being investigated.

artists, and designers, many spending more than eight hours a week composing
projects. In this community, young people, primarily between the ages of 18-26,
regularly critique, facilitate, and support each other in their composition
activities. They are motivated to participate by their shared interest and
affinity for their creative work. In the age of Wikipedia, this might not seem
particularly novel, but what I am actually describing is an online discussion
board, RPGmakerVX.net. Elsewhere, I have presented a general outline of the
kinds of individuals involved in this community and the way that the site as a
whole functions as an open learning environment (Owens, 2010). In this essay, I
present a case study of one participant in this community. His user name is Mr.
Moo, and at the time I interviewed him, he was a 19 year old college student
from Calgary, Canada. When he created his first role-playing game, Prelude of
Identity, he was eighteen. After providing a conceptual context for this case
study in work on collective intelligence, I draw out the relationship between
the technical system of the discussion boards and the creative process of
engaging with peers in the production of a video game. I suggest that the
discussion board rules and interaction enable a dialogue around composition
that ultimately leaves Mr. Moo with a valuable learning experience while also
producing a role-playing game. Thinking about this system from the perspective
of collective intelligence enables us to use these kinds of interest-driven,
online affinity communities as tools in an open education tool kit for
educators in more formal learning environments. Ultimately, discussion boards
in gaming communities, both the technical and social systems they represent,
could be thought of as instructional tools.

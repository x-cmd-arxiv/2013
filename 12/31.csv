system, stability is studied on the reduced level of the equation of motion for
the position over time of perturbed traveling waves. We find an interval of
perturbations of initial conditions for which position control is stable. This
interval can be interpreted as a localized region where traveling waves are
susceptible to perturbations. For stationary solutions of reaction-diffusion
systems with reflection symmetry, this region does not exist. Analytical
results are in qualitative agreement with numerical simulations of the

defined by their commonalities in terms of features rather than explicitly
specifying all products one-by-one. Several verification techniques were
adapted to establish temporal properties of SPLs. Symbolic and family-based
model checking have been proven to be successful for tackling the combinatorial
blow-up arising when reasoning about several feature combinations. However,
most formal verification approaches for SPLs presented in the literature focus
on the static SPLs, where the features of a product are fixed and cannot be
changed during runtime. This is in contrast to dynamic SPLs, allowing to adapt
feature combinations of a product dynamically after deployment. The main
contribution of the paper is a compositional modeling framework for dynamic
SPLs, which supports probabilistic and nondeterministic choices and allows for
quantitative analysis. We specify the feature changes during runtime within an
automata-based coordination component, enabling to reason over strategies how
to trigger dynamic feature changes for optimizing various quantitative
objectives, e.g., energy or monetary costs and reliability. For our framework
there is a natural and conceptually simple translation into the input language
of the prominent probabilistic model checker PRISM. This facilitates the
application of PRISM's powerful symbolic engine to the operational behavior of
dynamic SPLs and their family-based analysis against various quantitative
queries. We demonstrate feasibility of our approach by a case study issuing an

These density perturbations interact with young massive stars, emitting
ionizing radiation, alternately exposing and confining their HII regions. As a
result, the HII regions are predicted to flicker in flux density over periods
of decades to centuries rather than increasing monotonically in size as
predicted by simple Spitzer solutions. We have recently observed the Sgr B2
region at 1.3 cm with the VLA in its three hybrid configurations (DnC, CnB and
BnA) at a resolution of 0.25''. These observations were made to compare in
detail with matched continuum observations from 1989. At 0.25'' resolution, Sgr
B2 contains 41 UC HII regions, 6 of which are hypercompact. The new
observations of Sgr B2 allow comparison of relative peak flux densites for the
HII regions in Sgr B2 over a 23 year time baseline (1989-2012) in one of the
most source-rich massive star forming regions in the Milky Way. The new 1.3 cm

significant changes in their peak flux density, with one source (K3) dropping
in peak flux density, and the other 3 sources (F10.303, F1 and F3) increasing
in peak flux density. The results are consistent with statistical predictions
from simulations of high mass star formation, suggesting that they offer a

effectively enhanced by factors of order ${\cal O}(m_N/m_q)\sim 10^3$, where

performance of stressed silicon nitride nanomembranes as mechanical resonators
notoriously depends on how their frame is clamped to the sample mount, which in
practice usually necessitates delicate, and difficult-to-reproduce mounting
solutions. Here, we demonstrate that a phononic bandgap shield integrated in
the membrane's silicon frame eliminates this dependence, by suppressing
dissipation through phonon tunneling. We dry-etch the membrane's frame so that
it assumes the form of a $\mathrm{cm}$-sized bridge featuring a 1-dimensional
periodic pattern, whose phononic density of states is tailored to exhibit one,
or several, full band gaps around the membrane's high-$Q$ modes in the
MHz-range. We quantify the effectiveness of this phononic bandgap shield by
optical interferometry measuring both the suppressed transmission of
vibrations, as well as the influence of frame clamping conditions on the
membrane modes. We find suppressions up to $40~\mathrm{dB}$ and, for three
different realized phononic structures, consistently observe significant
suppression of the dependence of the membrane's modes on sample clamping - if
the mode's frequency lies in the bandgap. As a result, we achieve membrane mode
quality factors of $5\times 10^{6}$ with samples that are tightly bolted to the
$8~\mathrm{K}$-cold finger of a cryostat. $Q\times f$-products of $6\times
10^{12}~\mathrm{Hz}$ at $300~\mathrm{K}$ and $14\times 10^{12}~\mathrm{Hz}$ at

dimensional habitat, in which the free boundary represents the spreading front
and is caused only by the prey. In this problem it is assumed that the species
can only invade further into the new environment from the right end of the
initial region, and the spreading front expands at a speed that is proportional
to the prey's population gradient at the front. Moreover, the variable
intrinsic growth rate $r(t,x)$ is positive in pointwise but may be very small
as $t\to\infty$ or $x\to\infty$. The main objective is to realize the
dynamics/variations of prey, predator and free boundary. We first study the
long time behavior of $(u,v)$ for the vanishing case ($h_\infty<\infty$). Then
we find the criteria for spreading and vanishing. At last, the long time
behavior of $(u,v)$ for the spreading case ($h_\infty=\infty$) is discussed.
Theorems 2.2, 2.3 and 4.1 together establish a spreading-vanishing dichotomy.
Moreover, our model exhibits very different properties from the free boundary

to the following facts: first, it is claimed that the linearity conditions are
not satisfied, but nowhere in K12 the amplitudes of the perturbations were in
fact estimated. Therefore, without such estimates, the only possible conclusion
from this work is the well known fact that the perturbations indeed grow during
contraction, which, per se, does not imply that the linearity conditions become
invalid. Second, some evaluations of the linearity conditions are incorrect
because third other terms, instead of the appropriate second order ones, are
mistakenly compared with first order terms, yielding artificially fast growing
conditions. Finally, it is claimed that the results of K12 are in sharp
contrast with the results of the paper by Vitenti and Pinto-Neto (2012)

However, the author of K12 did not realized that the evolution of the

of the linearity conditions which are necessary to be checked cannot be
expressed in terms of gauge invariant quantities. In the present work, the
incorrect or incomplete statements of K12 are clarified and completed, and it
is shown that all other correct results of K12 were already present in VPN12,

newly proposed structure of non-uniform linear arrays, referred to as co-prime
arrays, in this paper. By exploiting the second order statistical information
of the received signals, co-prime arrays exhibit O(MN) degrees of freedom with
only M + N sensors. A sparsity based recovery method is proposed to fully
utilize these degrees of freedom. Unlike traditional sparse recovery methods,
the proposed method is based on the developing theory of super resolution,
which considers a continuous range of possible sources instead of discretizing
this range into a discrete grid. With this approach, off-grid effects inherited
in traditional sparse recovery can be neglected, thus improving the accuracy of
DOA estimation. In this paper we show that in the noiseless case one can
theoretically detect up to M N sources with only 2M + N sensors. The noise 2
statistics of co-prime arrays are also analyzed to demonstrate the robustness
of the proposed optimization scheme. A source number detection method is
presented based on the spectrum reconstructed from the sparse method. By
extensive numerical examples, we show the superiority of the proposed method in
terms of DOA estimation accuracy, degrees of freedom, and resolution ability

contribution to the resistivity of rare-earth metals in the paramagnetic state
is strongly underestimated if Matthiessen's rule is assumed to hold. To
understand this discrepancy, the resistivity of paramagnetic Fe and Gd is
evaluated by taking into account both spin and phonon disorder. Calculations
are performed using the supercell approach within the linear muffin-tin orbital
method. Phonon disorder is modeled by introducing random displacements of the
atomic nuclei, and the results are compared with the case of fictitious
Anderson disorder. In both cases the resistivity shows a nonlinear dependence
on the square of the disorder potential, which is interpreted as a resistivity
saturation effect. This effect is much stronger in Gd than in Fe. The
non-linearity makes the phonon and spin-disorder contributions to the
resistivity non-additive, and the standard procedure of extracting the
spin-disorder resistivity by extrapolation from high temperatures becomes
ambiguous. An ""apparent"" spin-disorder resistivity obtained through such
extrapolation is in much better agreement with experiment compared to the
results obtained by considering only spin disorder. By analyzing the spectral
function of the paramagnetic Gd in the presence of Anderson disorder, the
resistivity saturation is explained by the collapse of a large area of the
Fermi surface due to the disorder-induced mixing between the electronic and
hole sheets.

while the FWs, a sub-class of theirs, offer the possibility of arbitrarily

for instance 0 < z < L, of the wave propagation axis. More specifically, the
FWs are localized fields ""at rest"", that is, with a static envelope (within
which only the carrier wave propagates), and can be endowed moreover with a
high transverse localization. In this paper we investigate by simulated
experiments, various cases of generation of ultrasonic FW fields, with
frequency f_o = 1 MHz in a water-like medium, taking account of the effects of
attenuation. We present results of FWs for distances up to L=80 mm, in
attenuating media with absorption coefficients alpha in the range 70 < alpha <
170 dB/m. Such simulated FW fields are constructed by using a procedure
developed by us, via appropriate finite superpositions of monochromatic
ultrasonic Bessel beams. We pay due attention to the selection of the FW
parameters, constrained by the tight restrictions imposed by experimental
Acoustics, and to some practical implications of the transducer design. The
energy localization properties of the Frozen Waves can find application even in
many medical apparatus, such as bistouries or acoustic tweezers, and for

$\hat{1_K}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, a particular instance of the Phase Retrieval
Problem.
  We connect the Covariogram Problem to two aspects of the Fourier transform
$\hat{1_K}$ seen as a function in $\mathbb{C}^n$. The first connection is with
the problem of determining $K$ from the knowledge of the zero set of
$\hat{1_K}$ in $\mathbb{C}^n$. To attack this problem T. Kobayashi studied the
asymptotic behavior at infinity of this zero set. We obtain this asymptotic
behavior assuming less regularity on $K$ and we use this result as an essential
ingredient for proving that when $K$ is sufficiently smooth and in any
dimension $n$, $K$ is determined by $g_K$ in the class of sufficiently smooth
bodies.
  The second connection is with the irreducibility of the entire function
$\hat{1_K}$. This connection also shows a link between the Covariogram Problem
and the Pompeiu Problem in integral geometry.

Under fairly general assumptions on the initial data characterizing the

past to future null infinity, crossing the collapsing cloud through its center,
are always redshifted with respect to stationary observers. We compute this
redshift as a function of proper time of a distant stationary observer and
discuss its dependency on the mass distribution of the cloud. Possible

properties of the medium, i.e., in absence of any external field or
symmetry-breaking perturbations. Through an interplay by the gain and damping
effects, the moving soliton may overcome the Peierls-Nabarro barrier, present
in the corresponding conservative system, by self-induced time-periodic
oscillations of its power (norm) and energy (Hamiltonian), yielding exponential
decays to zero with different rates in the forward and backward directions. In
certain parameter windows, bistability appears between fast modes with small
oscillations, and slower, large-oscillation modes. The velocities and the
oscillation periods are typically related by lattice commensurability, and
exhibit period-doubling bifurcations to chaotically ""walking"" modes under
parameter variations. If the model is augmented by inter-site Kerr
nonlinearity, thereby reducing the Peierls-Nabarro barrier of the conservative

richer scenario appears including Hopf-bifurcations to incommensurately moving

associated mass scales cannot be described accurately from a truncated
effective theory, due to its inherently non-local nature involving long-range

  author",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Macroscopic quantum systems (MQS) are macroscopic systems driven by quantum
rather than classical mechanics, a long studied area with minimal success till
recently. Harnessing the benefits of quantum mechanics on a macroscopic level
would revolutionize fields ranging from telecommunication to biology, the
latter focused on here for reasons discussed. Contrary to misconceptions, there
are no known physical laws that prevent the development of MQS. Instead, they
are generally believed universally lost in complex systems from environmental
entanglements (decoherence). But we argue success is achievable MQS with
decoherence compensation developed, naturally or artificially, from top-down
rather current reductionist approaches. This paper advances the MQS field by a
complex systems approach to decoherence. First, why complex system decoherence
approaches (top-down) are needed is discussed. Specifically, complex adaptive
systems (CAS) are not amenable to reductionist models (and their master
equations) because of emergent behavior, approximation failures, not accounting
for quantum compensator mechanisms, ignoring path integrals, and the subentity
problem. In addition, since MQS must exist within the context of the classical
world, rapid decoherence and prolonged coherence are both needed. Nature has
already demonstrated this for quantum subsystems such as photosynthesis and
magnetoreception. Second, we perform a preliminary study that illustrates a
top-down approach to potential MQS. In summary, reductionist arguments against
MQS are not justifiable. It is more likely they are not easily detectable in
large intact classical systems or has been destroyed by reductionist
experimental set-ups. This complex systems decoherence approach, using top down
investigations, is critical to paradigm shifts in MQS research both in
biological and non-biological systems.

estimation of an $n$-dimensional mean vector $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ in the
Gaussian sequence model, is it possible to find an adaptive optimal threshold
estimator in a full range of sparsity levels where nonadaptive optimality can
be achieved by threshold estimators? We provide an explicit affirmative answer
as follows. Under the squared loss, adaptive minimaxity in strong and weak
$\ell_p$ balls with $0\le p<2$ is achieved by a class of smooth threshold
estimators with the threshold level of the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR rule or its a
certain approximation, provided that the minimax risk is between
$n^{-\delta_n}$ and $\delta_n n$ for some $\delta_n\to 0$. For $p=0$, this
means adaptive minimaxity in $\ell_0$ balls when $1\le
\|\boldsymbol{\theta}\|_0\ll n$. The class of smooth threshold estimators
includes the soft and firm threshold estimators but not the hard threshold
estimator. The adaptive minimaxity in such a wide range is a delicate problem
since the same is not true for the FDR hard threshold estimator at certain
threshold and nominal FDR levels. The above adaptive minimaxity of the FDR
smooth-threshold estimator is established by proving a stronger notion of
adaptive ratio optimality for the soft threshold estimator in the sense that
the risk for the FDR threshold level is uniformly within an infinitesimal
fraction of the risk for the optimal threshold level for each unknown vector,
when the minimum risk of nonadaptive soft threshold estimator is between
$n^{-\delta_n}$ and $\delta_n n$. It is an interesting consequence of this
adaptive ratio optimality that the FDR smooth-threshold estimator outperforms
the sample mean in the common mean model $\theta_i=\mu$ when $|\mu|<n^{-1/2}$.

motivation for further study of a high-scale supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking
model. In this framework, the minimal SUSY SU(5) grand unification model may be
viable since heavy sfermions suppress the proton decay via color-triplet Higgs
exchanges. At the same time, sizable flavor violation in sfermion masses is
still allowed by low-energy precision experiments when the mass scale is as
high as O(100) TeV, which naturally explains the 125 GeV Higgs mass. In the
presence of the sfermon flavor violation, however, the rates and branching
fractions of proton decay can be drastically changed. In this paper, we study
the effects of sfermion flavor structure on proton decay and discuss the

the ordinary first law of thermodynamics. In any CFT with a semiclassical
holographic dual, this first law has an interpretation in the dual
gravitational theory as a constraint on the spacetimes dual to CFT states. For
small perturbations around the CFT vacuum state, we show that the set of such
constraints for all ball-shaped spatial regions in the CFT is exactly
equivalent to the requirement that the dual geometry satisfy the gravitational
equations of motion, linearized about pure AdS. For theories with entanglement
entropy computed by the Ryu-Takayanagi formula $S=A/(4G_N)$, we obtain the
linearized Einstein equations. For theories in which the vacuum entanglement
entropy for a ball is computed by more general Wald functionals, we obtain the
linearized equations for the associated higher-curvature theories. Using the

given the holographic formula for entanglement entropy. This method provides a
simple alternative to holographic renormalization for computing the stress

indicates that unique equilibria are played if player's public disagreement is
substantial. If disagreement is small, equilibrium multiplicity depends on the
relative precisions of private signals and subjective priors. Extensions to
environments with public signals of exogenous and endogenous quality show that
prior heterogeneity, unlike heterogeneity in private information, provides a

cutoff with an $O(\sqrt{L})$-window.
  The main ingredient is an analysis of the front of the process (its rightmost
zero in the setup where zeros facilitate updates to their right). One expects
the front to advance as a biased random walk, whose normal fluctuations would
imply cutoff with an $O(\sqrt{L})$-window. The law of the process behind the
front plays a crucial role: Blondel showed that it converges to an invariant
measure $\nu$, on which very little is known. Here we obtain quantitative
bounds on the speed of convergence to $\nu$, finding that it is exponentially
fast. We then derive that the increments of the front behave as a stationary
mixing sequence of random variables, and a Stein-method based argument of
Bolthausen ('82) implies a CLT for the location of the front, yielding the
cutoff result.
  Finally, we supplement these results by a study of analogous kinetically
constrained models on trees, again establishing cutoff, yet this time with an

ways to reduce cross-flow vibrations of hydraulic gates with underflow. A
rectangular gate section placed in a flume was given freedom to vibrate in the
vertical direction. Holes in the gate bottom enabled leakage flow through the
gate to enter the area directly under the gate which is known to play a key
role in most excitation mechanisms. For submerged discharge conditions with
small gate openings the vertical dynamic support force was measured in the
reduced velocity range 1.5 < Vr < 10.5 for a gate with and without holes. The
leakage flow through the holes significantly reduced vibrations. This
attenuation was most profound in the high stiffness region at 2 < Vr < 3.5.
Two-dimensional numerical simulations were performed with the Finite Element
Method to assess local velocities and pressures for both gate types. A moving
mesh covering both solid and fluid domain allowed free gate movement and
two-way fluid-structure interactions. Modelling assumptions and observed
numerical effects are discussed and quantified. The simulated added mass in
still water is shown to be close to experimental values. The spring stiffness
and mass factor were varied to achieve similar response frequencies at the same
dry natural frequencies as in the experiment. Although it was not possible to
reproduce the vibrations dominated by impinging leading edge vortices (ILEV) at
relatively low Vr, the simulations at high Vr showed strong vibrations with
movement-induced excitation (MIE). For the latter case, the simulated response
reduction of the ventilated gate agrees with the experimental results. The
numerical modelling results suggest that the leakage flow diminishes the
whipping effect of fluctuations at the trailing edge associated with the
streamwise pressure drop across the gate and the body's vertical oscillatory
motion.

computing directly the response functions, eliminating the arbitrary source
from the start. Moreover, it provides a neat criterion for the infrared
regularity of the fluctuations. In particular, it is shown that the infrared
regularity conditions for scalar and tensor fluctuations coincide, and hence
they are either both regular or both singular. We demonstrate our numerical
recipe based on the Riccati equations by computing the holographic 2-point

$B$-mode signature predicted to arise from inflationary gravitational waves.
They also have the potential to constrain cosmic birefringence which would
produce non-zero expectation values for the CMB's $TB$ and $EB$ spectra.
However, instrumental systematic effects can also cause these $TB$ and $EB$
correlations to be non-zero. In particular, an overall miscalibration of the
polarization orientation of the detectors produces $TB$ and $EB$ spectra which
are degenerate with isotropic cosmological birefringence, while also
introducing a small but predictable bias on the $BB$ spectrum. The \bicep
three-year spectra, which use our standard calibration of detector polarization
angles from a dielectric sheet, are consistent with a polarization rotation of
$\alpha = -2.77^\circ \pm 0.86^\circ \text{(statistical)} \pm 1.3^\circ
\text{(systematic)}$. We revise the estimate of systematic error on the
polarization rotation angle from the two-year analysis by comparing multiple
calibration methods. We investigate the polarization rotation for the \bicep
100 GHz and 150 GHz bands separately to investigate theoretical models that
produce frequency-dependent cosmic birefringence. We find no evidence in the
data supporting either these models or Faraday rotation of the CMB polarization
by the Milky Way galaxy's magnetic field. If we assume that there is no cosmic
birefringence, we can use the $TB$ and $EB$ spectra to calibrate detector
polarization orientations, thus reducing bias of the cosmological $B$-mode
spectrum from leaked $E$-modes due to possible polarization orientation
miscalibration. After applying this ""self-calibration"" process, we find that
the upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio decreases slightly, from $r<0.70$
to $r<0.65$ at $95\%$ confidence.

cosmology, here we demonstrate that, upon obtaining more precise observational
measurements through future cosmological surveys, the lensing dispersion can
very effectively be used to gain information on the poorly understood

matter halos and the importance of gas physics and star formation into shaping
the large-scale structure. In order to illustrate this point we verify that
even the tentative current measurements of the lensing dispersion performed on

are somewhat less compact than predicted by $n-$body cosmological simulations.
Moreover, we are also able to put lower limits on the slope of the

star and the reddest part of the HB (RHB) to generate reduced equivalent widths
(rEW) from the datasets presented in Saviane et al. (2012) and Rutledge et al.
(1997). Subsequently we calibrated these rEW against three different
metellicity (met) scales: the one presented in Carretta et al. (2009), the met
values given in Harris (2010) and a version of the former corrected via
high-resolution spectroscopic met. Results. We calculated the calibration
relations for the two datasets and the three met scales and found that they are
approximately equivalent, with differences almost negligible. We compared our
nIR calibrations with the corresponding optical ones, and found them to be
equivalent, establishing that the luminosity-corrected rEW using the Ks
magnitude is compatible with the one obtained from the V magnitude. We then
used the met obtained from the calibration to investigate the internal met
distributions of the GCs. Conclusions. We have established that the
([Fe/H]:rEW) relation is independent from the mag used for the luminosity
correction and find that the calibration relations only change slightly for
different met scales. The CaT technique using NIR photometry is thus a powerful
tool to derive met. In particular, it can be used to study the internal met
spread of a GC. We confirm the presence of at least two met populations in NGC

acts as a nucleation site for the bubble. The effect is larger than previously
believed due to the contributions to the action from conical singularities. For
a sufficiently low initial mass, the original black hole is replaced by flat
space during this process, as viewed by a single causal patch observer.
Increasing the initial mass, we find a critical value above which a black hole
remnant survives the process. This resulting black hole can have a higher mass

model (SM) Higgs, once SM is extended to its left-right symmetric version
(LRSM) to understand the origin of parity violation in weak interactions as
well as to accommodate small neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism. The
flavor changing neutral Higgs (FCNH) effects in the minimal version of this
model (LRSM), however, push the second Higgs mass to more than 15 TeV making it
inaccessible at the LHC. Furthermore since the second Higgs mass is directly
linked to the $W_R$ mass, discovery of a ""low"" mass $W_R$ ($M_{W_R}\leq 5-6$
TeV) at the LHC would require values for some Higgs self couplings larger than
one. In this paper we present an extension of LRSM by adding a vector-like
$SU(2)_R$ quark doublet which weakens the FCNH constraints allowing the second
Higgs mass to be near or below TeV and a third neutral Higgs below 3 TeV for a
$W_R$ mass below 5 TeV. It is then possible to search for these heavier Higgs
bosons at the LHC, without conflicting with FCNH constraints. A right handed
$W_R$ mass in the few TeV range is quite natural in this class of models
without having to resort to large scalar coupling parameters. The CKM mixings
are intimately linked to the vector-like quark mixings with the known quarks,
which is the main reason why the constraints on the second Higgs mass is
relaxed. We present a detailed theoretical and phenomenological analysis of
this extended LR model and point out some tests as well as its potential for

for random wave functions on disordered lattices. It is more sensitive than the
traditional inverse participation ratios and their moments in the cases where
the extended state is very sparse. We express the typical support set
$S_{\varepsilon}$ in terms of the distribution function of the wave function
amplitudes and illustrate the scaling of $S_{\varepsilon}\propto N^{\alpha}$
with $N$ (the lattice size) for the most general case of the multi-fractal
distribution. A number of relationships between the new exponent $\alpha$ and
the conventional spectrum of multi-fractal dimensions is established. These
relationships are tested by numerical study of statistics of wave functions on
disordered Bethe lattices. We also obtain numerically the finite-size spectrum
of fractal dimensions on the Bethe lattice which shows two apparent fixed
points as $N$ increases. The results allow us to conjecture that extended
states on the Bethe lattice at all strengths of disorder below the localization
transition are non-ergodic with a clear multifractal structure that evolves
towards almost ergodic behavior in the clean limit.

strategy consists of relaxing the problem of solving the

solved via a new policy iteration method. The proposed method distinguishes
from previously known nonlinear ADP methods in that the neural network
approximation is avoided, giving rise to significant computational improvement.
Instead of semiglobally or locally stabilizing, the resultant control policy is
globally stabilizing for a general class of nonlinear polynomial systems.
Furthermore, in the absence of the a priori knowledge of the system dynamics,
an online learning method is devised to implement the proposed policy iteration
technique by generalizing the current ADP theory. Finally, three numerical
examples are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

time-scales, thus opening up the prospect of manipulating electronic wave
packets for steering molecular dynamics. However, two decades after the birth
of attosecond physics, the concept of attosecond chemistry has not yet been
realized. This is because excitation and manipulation of molecular orbitals
requires precisely controlled attosecond waveforms in the deep ultraviolet,
which have not yet been synthesized. Here, we present a novel approach using
attosecond vacuum ultraviolet pulse-trains to coherently excite and control the
outcome of a simple chemical reaction in a deuterium molecule in a non-Born
Oppenheimer regime. By controlling the interfering pathways of electron wave
packets in the excited neutral and singly-ionized molecule, we unambiguously
show that we can switch the excited electronic state on attosecond timescales,
coherently guide the nuclear wave packets to dictate the way a neutral molecule
vibrates, and steer and manipulate the ionization and dissociation channels.
Furthermore, through advanced theory, we succeed in rigorously modeling
multi-scale electron and nuclear quantum control in a molecule for the first
time. The observed richness and complexity of the dynamics, even in this very
simplest of molecules, is both remarkable and daunting, and presents intriguing
new possibilities for bridging the gap between attosecond physics and
attochemistry.

a fairly well-defined edge, with a population of GMC-sized (tens- to
hundreds-of-pc scale), isolated, highly extincting dust clouds located up to
~1.5 kpc radially beyond it. Outside of these dense clouds, the area has little
or no diffuse dust extinction, indicating that the clouds have decoupled from
the lower-density ISM material that has already been stripped. Several of the
dust clouds have elongated morphologies that indicate active ram pressure,
including two large (kpc-scale) filaments in NGC 4402 that are elongated in the
projected ICM wind direction. We calculate a lower limit on the HI + H_2 masses
of these clouds based on their dust extinctions and find that a correction
factor of ~10 gives cloud masses consistent with those measured in CO for
clouds of similar diameters, probably due to the complicating factors of
foreground light, cloud substructure, and resolution limitations. Assuming that
the clouds' actual masses are consistent with those of GMCs of similar
diameters (~10^4-10^5 M_sun), we estimate that only a small fraction (~1-10%)
of the original HI + H_2 remains in the parts of the disks with decoupled
clouds. Based on H-alpha images, a similar fraction of star formation persists
in these regions, 2-3% of the estimated pre-stripping star formation rate. We

Here, we explore the conditions under which stationary many-body entanglement
persists with near-unit fidelity and high scalability. In our approach,
coherent many-body dynamics is driven by Rydberg-mediated laser transitions,
while atoms at the lattice boundary reduce the entropy of the many-body state.
Surprisingly, the many-body entanglement is established by continuously
evolving a locally dissipative Rydberg system towards the steady-state, as with
optical pumping. We characterize the dynamics of multipartite entanglement in a
1D lattice by way of quantum uncertainty relations, and demonstrate the
long-range behavior of the stationary entanglement with finite-size scaling,
reaching ""hectapartite"" entanglement under experimental conditions. Our work
opens a route towards dissipative preparation of many-body entanglement with

accretion rate to the supermassive black hole (SMBH). These inflows can thus
lead, during less than one activity cycle, to the accumulation of enough gas in
the inner few hundred parsecs, to trigger the formation of new stars, leading
to the growth of the galaxy bulge. Young to intermediate age stars have indeed
been found in circumnuclear rings around a number of Active Galactic Nuclei

inspired by MapReduce. For example, for the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem
over a set of points in the two-dimensional space, our algorithm computes a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate MST. Our algorithms work in a constant number of
rounds of communication, while using total space and communication proportional
to the size of the data (linear space and near linear time algorithms). In
contrast, for general graphs, achieving the same result for MST (or even
connectivity) remains a challenging open problem, despite drawing significant
attention in recent years.
  We develop a general algorithmic framework that, besides MST, also applies to
Earth-Mover Distance (EMD) and the transportation cost problem. Our algorithmic
framework has implications beyond the MapReduce model. For example it yields a
new algorithm for computing EMD cost in the plane in near-linear time,
$n^{1+o_\epsilon(1)}$. We note that while recently Sharathkumar and Agarwal
developed a near-linear time algorithm for $(1+\epsilon)$-approximating EMD,
our algorithm is fundamentally different, and, for example, also solves the
transportation (cost) problem, raised as an open question in their work.
Furthermore, our algorithm immediately gives a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation
algorithm with $n^{\delta}$ space in the streaming-with-sorting model with
$1/\delta^{O(1)}$ passes. As such, it is tempting to conjecture that the
parallel models may also constitute a concrete playground in the quest for
efficient algorithms for EMD (and other similar problems) in the vanilla
streaming model, a well-known open problem.

recently introduced for attractive binary pairwise MRFs which is guaranteed to
return an $\epsilon$-approximation to the global minimum of $F$ in polynomial

important result that approximating $\log$ of the Bethe partition function,
$\log Z_B=-\min F$, for a general model to additive $\epsilon$-accuracy may be

observational state of the field, with constraints from the cosmic microwave
background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), Type Ia supernovae (SN),
direct measurements of the Hubble constant ($H_0$), and measurements of galaxy
and matter clustering. Assuming a flat universe and dark energy with a constant
equation-of-state parameter $w = P/\rho$, the combination of Planck CMB
temperature anisotropies, WMAP CMB polarization, the Union2.1 SN compilation,
and a compilation of BAO measurements yields $w = -1.10^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$,
consistent with a cosmological constant ($w=-1$). However, with these
constraints the cosmological constant model predicts a value of $H_0$ that is
lower than several of the leading recent estimates, and it predicts a parameter
combination $\sigma_8(\Omega_m)^{0.5}$ that is higher than many estimates from
weak gravitational lensing, galaxy clusters, and redshift-space distortions.
Individually these tensions are only significant at the ~$2\sigma$ level, but
they arise in multiple data sets with independent statistics and distinct
sources of systematic uncertainty. The tensions are stronger with Planck CMB
data than they were with WMAP because of the smaller statistical errors and the
higher central value of $\Omega_m.$ With the improved measurements expected
from the next generation of data sets, these tensions may diminish, or they may
sharpen in a way that points towards a more complete physical understanding of

particles in view of the concrete model of Hardy, who analyzed the criterion of
entanglement without referring to inequality. The basis of our analysis is the
linearity of the probability measure related to the Born probability
interpretation, which excludes non-contextual hidden-variables models in $d\geq
3$. To be specific, we note the inconsistency of the non-contextual
hidden-variables model in $d=4$ with the linearity of the quantum mechanical
probability measure in the sense $\langle\psi|{\bf a}\cdot {\bf
\sigma}\otimes{\bf b}\cdot {\bf \sigma}|\psi\rangle+\langle\psi|{\bf a}\cdot
{\bf \sigma}\otimes{\bf b}^{\prime}\cdot {\bf

${\bf b}^{\prime}$. It is then shown that Hardy's model in $d=4$ does not lead
to a unique mathematical expression in the demonstration of the discrepancy of
local realism (hidden-variables model) with entanglement and thus his proof is
incomplete. We identify the origin of this non-uniqueness with the
non-uniqueness of translating quantum mechanical expressions into expressions
in hidden-variables models, which results from the failure of the above
linearity of the probability measure. In contrast, if the linearity of the
probability measure is strictly imposed, which is tantamount to asking that the
non-contextual hidden-variables model in $d=4$ gives the CHSH inequality
$|\langle B\rangle|\leq 2$ uniquely, it is shown that the hidden-variables
model can describe only separable quantum mechanical states; this conclusion is
in perfect agreement with the so-called Gisin's theorem which states that
$|\langle B\rangle|\leq 2$ implies separable states.

sensitive to the physical conditions within stars. The astrophysical site to
produce fluorine is suggested to be asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. In
these stars the 15N(n, g)16N reaction could affect the abundance of fluorine by
competing with 15N(a, g)19F. The 15N(n, g)16N reaction rate depends directly on
the neutron spectroscopic factors of the low-lying states in 16N. The angular
distributions of the 15N(7Li, 6Li)16N reaction populating the ground state and
the first three excited states in 16N are measured using a Q3D magnetic
spectrograph and are used to derive the spectroscopic factors of these states
based on distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA) analysis. The spectroscopic
factors of these four states are extracted to be 0.96+-0.09, 0.69+-0.09,
0.84+-0.08 and 0.65+-0.08, respectively. Based on the new spectroscopic factors
we derive the 15N(n,g)16N reaction rate. The accuracy and precision of the
spectroscopic factors are enhanced due to the first application of
high-precision magnetic spectrograph for resolving the closely-spaced 16N
levels which can not be achieved in most recent measurement. The present result
demonstrates that two levels corresponding to neutron transfers to the 2s1/2
orbit in 16N are not so good single-particle levels although 15N is a closed
neutron-shell nucleus. This finding is contrary to the shell model expectation.
The present work also provides an independent examination to shed some light on
the existing discrepancies in the spectroscopic factors and the 15N(n, g)16N
rate.

continuous phase transition. The classic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR)
model of epidemics is one such example where the scaling behavior near a
critical point has been studied extensively. In this system the distribution of
outbreak sizes scales as $P(n) \sim n^{-3/2}$ at the critical point as the
system size $N$ becomes infinite. The finite-size scaling laws for the outbreak
size and duration are also well understood and characterized. In this work, we
report scaling laws for a model with SIR structure coupled with a constant
force of infection per susceptible, akin to a `reservoir forcing'. We find that
the statistics of outbreaks in this system are fundamentally different than
those in a simple SIR model. Instead of fixed exponents, all scaling laws
exhibit tunable exponents parameterized by the dimensionless rate of external
forcing. As the external driving rate approaches a critical value, the scale of
the average outbreak size converges to that of the maximal size, and above the
critical point, the scaling laws bifurcate into two regimes. Whereas a simple
SIR process can only exhibit outbreaks of size $\mathcal{O}(N^{1/3})$ and
$\mathcal{O}(N)$ depending on whether the system is at or above the epidemic
threshold, a driven SIR process can exhibit a richer spectrum of outbreak sizes
that scale as $O(N^{\xi})$ where $\xi \in (0,1] \backslash \{2/3\}$ and
$\mathcal{O}((N/\log N)^{2/3})$ at the multi-critical point.

  advancing scheme for fluid structure interaction","24 pages",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We develop a combined field formulation for the fluid structure (FS)
interaction problem. The unknowns are (u;p;v), being the fluid velocity, fluid
pressure and solid velocity. This combined field formulation uses Arbitrary
Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) description for the fluid and Lagrangian description
for the solid. It automatically enforces the simultaneous continuities of both
velocity and traction along the FS interface. We present a first order in time
fully discrete scheme when the flow is incompressible Navier-Stokes and when
the solid is elastic. The interface position is determined by first order
extrapolation so that the generation of the fluid mesh and the computation of
(u;p;v) are decoupled. This explicit interface advancing enables us to save
half of the unknowns comparing with traditional monolithic schemes. When the
solid has convex strain energy (e.g. linear elastic), we prove that the total
energy of the fluid and the solid at time t^{n} is bounded by the total energy
at time t^{n-1}. Like in the continuous case, the fluid mesh velocity which is
used in ALE description does not enter into the stability bound. Surprisingly,
the nonlinear convection term in the Navier-Stokes equations plays a crucial
role to stabilize the scheme and the stability result does not apply to Stokes
flow. As the nonlinear convection term is treated semi-implicitly, in each time
step, we only need to solve a linear system (and only once) which involves
merely (u;p;v) if the solid is linear elastic. Two numerical tests including
the benchmark test of Navier-Stokes flow past a Saint Venant-Kirchhoff elastic
bar are performed. In addition to the stability, we also confirm the first
order temporal accuracy of our explicit interface advancing scheme.

analyses regarding FoBa-obj for general smooth convex functions; 2) We show
that FoBa-gdt achieves the same theoretical performance as FoBa-obj under the

consistent with the bounds of a special case (least squares) and fills a
previously existing theoretical gap for general convex smooth functions; 3) We
show that the restricted strong convexity condition is satisfied if the number
of independent samples is more than $\bar{k}\log d$ where $\bar{k}$ is the
sparsity number and $d$ is the dimension of the variable; 4) We apply FoBa-gdt

and non-uniform spectral gap condition (including a slightly extended adiabatic
theorem of higher order). In these adiabatic theorems the considered spectral
subsets $\sigma(t)$ have only to be compact -- in particular, they need not
consist of eigenvalues. We then prove an adiabatic theorem without spectral gap
condition for not necessarily (weakly) semisimple eigenvalues: in essence, it
is only required there that the considered spectral subsets $\sigma(t) = \{

and that there exist projections $P(t)$ reducing $A(t)$ such that
$A(t)|_{P(t)D(A(t))}-\lambda(t)$ is nilpotent and
$A(t)|_{(1-P(t))D(A(t))}-\lambda(t)$ is injective with dense range in
$(1-P(t))X$ for almost every~$t$. In all these theorems, the regularity
conditions imposed on $t \mapsto A(t)$, $\sigma(t)$, $P(t)$ are fairly mild. We
explore the strength of the presented adiabatic theorems in numerous examples.
And finally, we apply the adiabatic theorems for time-dependent domains to
obtain -- in a very simple way -- adiabatic theorems for operators $A(t)$

investigate the effects of the higher-order symmetry energy on the proton
fraction in neutron stars and the location of the inner edge of their crusts
and their core-crust transition density and pressure, thermodynamically.
Analytical expressions for different-order symmetry energy coefficients of ANM
are derived using the realistic interactions mentioned above. It is found that
the higher-order terms of the symmetry energy coefficients up to its
eighth-order (E$_{sym8}$) contributes substantially to the proton fraction in
$\beta$ stable neutron star matter at different nuclear matter densities, the
core-crust transition density and pressure. Even by considering the symmetry
energy coefficients up to E$_{sym8}$, we obtain a significant change of about
40$\%$ in the transition pressure value from the one based on the exact
equation of state. Using equations of state based on both Paris and Reid
effective interactions which provide saturation incompressibility of symmetric
nuclear matter in the range of 220 MeV$\leq$K$_0$$\leq$270 MeV, we estimate the
ranges 0.090 fm$^{-3}$$\leq$$\rho_t$$\leq$0.095 fm$^{-3}$ and 0.49 MeV

coupling between two spin-orbit qubits in a nanowire double quantum dot (DQD)
with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). We find that while the total tunneling
in the DQD is irrelevant to the SOC, both the spin-conserved and spin-flipped
tunnelings are SOC dependent and can compete with each other in the strong SOC
regime. Moreover, the Coulomb repulsion between electrons can combine with the
SOC-dependent tunnelings to yield an anisotropic exchange coupling between the
two spin-orbit qubits. Also, we give an explicit physical mechanism for this
anisotropic exchange coupling.

systems based on a relatively recent theory in immunology called Danger theory.
Based on Danger theory, immune response in natural systems is a result of
sensing corruption as well as sensing unknown substances. In contrast,
traditional self-nonself discrimination theory states that immune response is
only initiated by sensing nonself (unknown) patterns. Danger theory solves many
problems that could only be partially explained by the traditional model.
Although the traditional model is simpler, such problems result in high false
positive rates in immune-inspired intrusion detection systems. We believe using
danger theory in a multi-agent environment that computationally emulates the
behavior of natural immune systems is effective in reducing false positive
rates. We first describe a simplified scenario of immune response in natural
systems based on danger theory and then, convert it to a computational model as
a network protocol. In our protocol, we define several immune signals and model
cell signaling via message passing between agents that emulate cells. Most
messages include application-specific patterns that must be meaningfully
extracted from various system properties. We show how to model these messages
in practice by performing a case study on the problem of detecting distributed
denial-of-service attacks in wireless sensor networks. We conduct a set of
systematic experiments to find a set of performance metrics that can accurately
distinguish malicious patterns. The results indicate that the system can be
efficiently used to detect malicious patterns with a high level of accuracy.

a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based MISMO modeling strategy, which is
capable of determining the number of sub-models in a self-adaptive mode, with
varying prediction horizons. Rather than deriving crisp divides with equal-size
s prediction horizons from the established MISMO, the proposed PSO-MISMO
strategy, implemented with neural networks, employs a heuristic to create
flexible divides with varying sizes of prediction horizons and to generate
corresponding sub-models, providing considerable flexibility in model

transport in the outer 1 % of the radius. Its typical scale of about 1 - 2 Mm
is set by the balance between convection, free-streaming radiation, and the
strong density stratification in the surface layers.
  The physics of granulation is well understood, as demonstrated by the close
agreement between numerical simulation, theory, and observation. Superimposed
on the energetic granular structure comprising high-speed flows, are larger
scale long-lived flow systems (~ 300 m/s) called supergranules.
Supergranulation has a typical scale of 24 - 36 Mm. It is not clear if
supergranulation results from the interaction of granules or is causally linked
to deep convection or a consequence of magneto-convection. Other outstanding
questions remain: how deep are supergranules? How do they participate in global
dynamics of the Sun? Further challenges are posed by our lack of insight into
the dynamics of larger scales in the deep convection region. Recent
helioseismic constraints have suggested that convective velocity amplitudes on
large scales may be overestimated by an order of magnitude or more, implying
that Reynolds stresses associated with large-scale convection, thought to play
a significant role in the sustenance of differential rotation and meridional
circulation, might be two orders of magnitude weaker than theory and
computation predict. While basic understanding on the nature of convection on
global scales and the maintenance of global circulations is incomplete,
progress is imminent, given substantial improvements in computation, theory and
helioseismic inferences.

the heating of the solar corona, and both processes are operated in magnetic
structures formed on the Sun. To study the magnetic configuration responsible
for these processes, we use three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations
to reproduce magnetic structures via flux emergence and investigate their
configurations. We focus on two key quantities characterizing a magnetic
configuration: the force-free parameter alpha and the flux expansion rate fex,
the former of which represents how much a magnetic field is twisted while the
latter represents how sharply a magnetic field expands. We derive distributions
of these quantities in an emerging flux region. Our result shows that an
emerging flux region consists of outer part where a magnetic loop takes a large
flux expansion rate but a small value of alpha at their photospheric
footpoints, and inner part occupied by those loops where a strong electric
current flows. We also investigate the expansion profile of a magnetic loop
composing an emerging flux region. The profile is given by an exponential
expansion type near the solar surface while it is given by a quadratic
expansion type in an outer atmosphere. These detailed magnetic configurations
obtained by this study contribute to developing a realistic model for the
coronal heating and solar wind generation.

span networks with different technologies and allow for disconnected operation.
Furthermore, with the ability to communicate between names, the communication
path can be dynamically bound to any of a number of end-points, and the
end-points themselves could change as needed. A key benefit of our architecture
is its ability to accommodate gradual migration from the current IP
infrastructure to a future that may be a ubiquitous Information Centric
Network. Basic building blocks of Internames are: i) a name-based Application
Programming Interface; ii) a separation of identifiers (names) and locators;
iii) a powerful Name Resolution Service (NRS) that dynamically maps names to
locators, as a function of time/location/context/service; iv) a built-in
capacity of evolution, allowing a transparent migration from current networks

To achieve this vision, shared by many other researchers, we exploit and expand
on Information Centric Networking principles, extending ICN functionality

to use names also to route data in the return path. A key role in this

popular front of research in recent times due to its success in application
problems like Object Categorization. This success is due to the fact that MKL
has the ability to choose from a variety of feature kernels to identify the
optimal kernel combination. But the initial formulation of MKL was only able to
select the best of the features and misses out many other informative kernels
presented. To overcome this, the Lp norm based formulation was proposed by
Kloft et. al. This formulation is capable of choosing a non-sparse set of
kernels through a control parameter p. Unfortunately, the parameter p does not
have a direct meaning to the number of kernels selected. We have observed that
stricter control over the number of kernels selected gives us an edge over
these techniques in terms of accuracy of classification and also helps us to
fine tune the algorithms to the time requirements at hand. In this work, we
propose a Controlled Sparsity Kernel Learning (CSKL) formulation that can
strictly control the number of kernels which we wish to select. The CSKL
formulation introduces a parameter t which directly corresponds to the number
of kernels selected. It is important to note that a search in t space is finite

Descent based algorithm to solve the CSKL formulation, which is proven to
converge. Through our experiments on the Caltech101 Object Categorization

structural resembleance to a single MoS$_2$ layer is found to possess a lower
total energy than low-buckled silicene and to be stable in terms of its phonon

advocates diverse Si bonding configurations different from those of C atoms.

Nevertheless, there is still significant room for Higgs physics beyond the
Standard Model. Many approaches to electroweak symmetry breaking possess a
decoupling limit in which the properties of the lightest CP-even Higgs scalar
approach those of the SM Higgs boson. In some cases, an apparent SM-like Higgs
signal can also arise in a regime that may not be governed by the decoupling
limit. One such scenario can be realized if the observed Higgs signal is a
result of two unresolved nearly-mass-degenerate scalar states. The general
two-Higgs doublet model provides a useful framework for studying the decoupling
limit and possible departures from SM-like Higgs behavior. The implications for
current and future Higgs data are briefly considered.

PhotoObj table with known star-galaxy separation, and determined redshift

results comparable to the multi-dimensional SVM classification. We present a

contamination from Moon glow. We show that the homogeneity of the full sky

giant neutron-rich nuclei. This picture is especially relevant for low-mass
(below about solar mass) neutron stars, where non-nucleonic components are not
expected to occur. Due to the saturation property of nucleonic matter, leading
to the celebrated liquid-drop picture of atomic nuclei, empirical nuclear
masses and radii can be approximately expressed as function of atomic mass
number. It is, however, not straightforward to express masses and radii of
neutron stars even in the low-mass range where the structure is determined by a
balance between the pressure of neutron-rich nucleonic matter and the gravity.
Such expressions would be of great use given possible simultaneous mass and
radius measurements. Here we successfully construct theoretical formulas for
the masses and radii of low-mass neutron stars from various models that are
consistent with empirical masses and radii of stable nuclei. In this process,
we discover a new equation-of-state parameter that characterizes the structure
of low-mass neutron stars. This parameter, which plays a key role in connecting
the mass-radius relation of the laboratory nuclei to that of the celestial
objects, could be constrained from future observations of low-mass neutron
stars.

is, a factor covering at least $\alpha$ positions in $w$. We develop a data
structure of $O(n)$ size (where $n=|w|$) that can be constructed in $O(n\log
n)$ time which we apply to compute all shortest $\alpha$-partial covers for a
given $\alpha$. We also employ it for an $O(n\log n)$-time algorithm computing
a shortest $\alpha$-partial cover for each $\alpha=1,2,\ldots,n$.

periodically driven in time has been an open question since the beginning of
quantum mechanics. After an initial transient, such a system is known to
synchronize with the driving; in contrast to the non-driven case, no
fundamental principle has been proposed for constructing the resulting
non-equilibrium state. Here, we analytically show that, for a class of
integrable systems, the relevant ensemble is constructed by maximizing an
appropriately defined entropy subject to constraints, which we explicitly
identify. This result constitutes a generalisation of the concepts of
equilibrium statistical mechanics to a class of far-from-equilibrium-systems,
up to now mainly accessible using ad-hoc methods.

various situations in which the usage of multiple approaches is required, e.g.
to strengthen a particular process with multiple quality approaches or to reach
certification of the compliance to a number of standards. First of all it has
to be decided which approaches have potential for the organization. In many
cases one approach does not contain enough information for process
implementation. Consequently, the organization may need to use several
approaches and the decision has to be made how the chosen approaches can be
used simultaneously. This area is called Multi-model Software Process
Improvement (MSPI). The simultaneous usage of multiple quality approaches is
called the multi-model problem. In this dissertation we propose a solution for
the multi-model problem which we call the Process Based Unification (PBU)
framework. The PBU framework consists of the PBU concept, a PBU process and the
PBU result. We call PBU concept the mapping of quality approaches to a unified
process. The PBU concept is operationalized by a PBU process. The PBU result
includes the resulting unified process and the mapping of quality approaches to
the unified process.

to improve three major business areas namely the Customer Experience, The
Operational Efficiency and Revenue and Margin. To meet the business requiements
related to these areas, service providers are going through three major
transformation programs namely the Business Support Systems transformation
program for Customer related aspects, the Operations Support System
transformation program for mainly service Fulfillment and Assurance and
Resource, Fulfillment and Assurance, and Time To Market Transformation program
for Products ans Services development and management. These transformations are
about making a transition from a current situation with all its views to a
desired one. The information view transformation is about reorganizing and
reengineering the existing information to be used for the day to day activities
and reporting to support decision making. For reporting purpose, service
providers have to invest in Business Intelligence solutions. For which the main
purpose is to provide the right information in a timely manner to efficiently
support the decision making. One of the key BI challenges is to model an
information structure where to host all the information coming from multiple
sources. The purpose of this paper is to suggest a step by step methodology to
design a Telco Data Mart, one of the fundamental BI components.
Order-To-Payment, an end to end customer process, will be used as an
application for this methodology. Our methodology consists on bringing together
the concepts of business intelligence and the telecom business frameworks
developed by the TM Forum: the Business Process Framework, the Information
Framework, and the Business Metrics. The advantage of this solution is its
ability to adapt to any telecom enterprise architecture since it's built around
the business standards.

and bone equivalent media are studied. For lung equivalent media a Balsa wood
is used, and for a soft bone equivalent media a compound material with epoxy
resin, hardener and calcium carbonate is used. Polystyrene slabs put together
with these materials are used as an inhomogeneous phantom. Dose measurements
are performed with Gafchromic EBT film by using photon beams from 6MV
CyberKnife at the Seoul Uridul Hospital. The cone sizes of the photon beams are
varied from 5, 10 to 30 mm. As a simulation tool GEANT4 Monte Carlo code
v9.4.p02 is used. When the Balsa wood is inserted in the phantom, the dose
measured with EBT film is found to be significantly different from the dose
without the EBT film in and beyond the Balsa wood region, particularly for
small field sizes. On the other hand, when the soft bone equivalent material is
inserted in the phantom, discrepancy between the dose measured with EBT film
and the dose without EBT film can be seen only in the region of bone equivalent
material. GEANT4 simulations are done with and without the EBT film to compare
the simulation results with measurements. We find that the simulations
including EBT film agree with the measurements for all the cases within an
error of $2.2\%$. Also, we find the ""doses to phantom"" without the EBT film
differ from the ""doses to film"" up to $29\%$, which shows that for accurate
dose estimations for inhomogeneous phantoms with EBT film the presence of the
EBT film needs to be taken into account properly in particular for small
fields.

correlation dimension of the above mentioned diseases is estimated. The results
are also compared with healthy control subjects. At the next step, existence of
chaos in these diseases is investigated by means of the so-called 0-1 test. The
simulations show that none of the above mentioned diseases are chaotic.

using data from the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS). We introduce a
new technique based on Slepian wavelet variance (SWV) that shows comparable or
better performance to structure functions and damped random walk models but
with fewer assumptions. Combining these methods with WISE mid-IR colors
produces a highly efficient quasar selection technique which we have validated
spectroscopically. The SWV technique also identifies characteristic timescales
in a time series and we find a characteristic rest frame timescale of ~54 days,
confirmed in the light curves of ~18000 quasars from CRTS, SDSS and MACHO data,
and anticorrelated with absolute magnitude. This indicates a transition between
a damped random walk and $P(f) \propto f^{-1/3}$ behaviours and is the first
strong indication that a damped random walk model may be too simplistic to
describe optical quasar variability.

gravitational phase factors define the Lorentz transformations between the
local inertial coordinate systems of different positions. With this point we
show that the spectral shifts in the curved spacetime, such as the
gravitational and cosmological redshifts, can be understood as Doppler shifts.
All these shifts are interpreted in a unified way as being originated from the
relative motion of the free falling observers instantaneously static with the
wave source and the receiver respectively. The gravitational phase factor of
quantum systems in the curved spacetime is also discussed.

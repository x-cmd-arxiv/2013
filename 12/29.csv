multiple time-varying signals with general linear dynamics, whose reference
inputs are nonzero and not available to any agent in the network. In
distributed fashion, a pair of continuous algorithms with, respectively, static
and adaptive coupling strengths are designed. Based on the boundary layer
concept, the proposed continuous algorithm with static coupling strengths can
asymptotically track the average of the multiple reference signals without
chattering phenomenon. Furthermore, for the case of algorithms with adaptive
coupling strengths, the average tracking errors are uniformly ultimately
bounded and exponentially converge to a small adjustable bounded set. Finally,
a simulation example is presented to show the validity of the theoretical
results.

novel low-level face representation named Shape Primitives Histogram (SPH) for
face recognition. Since human faces exist abundant shape features, we address
the face representation issue from the perspective of the shape feature
extraction. In our approach, we divide faces into a number of tiny shape
fragments and reduce these shape fragments to several uniform atomic shape
patterns called Shape Primitives. A convolution with Haar Wavelet templates is
applied to each shape fragment to identify its belonging shape primitive. After
that, we do a histogram statistic of shape primitives in each spatial local
image patch for incorporating the spatial information. Finally, each face is
represented as a feature vector via concatenating all the local histograms of
shape primitives. Four popular face databases, namely ORL, AR, Yale-B and LFW-a
databases, are employed to evaluate SPH and experimentally study the choices of
the parameters. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
approach outperform the state-of-the-arts.

with general linear dynamics and multiple leaders whose control inputs are
possibly nonzero and time varying. Based on the relative states of neighboring
agents, a distributed static continuous controller is designed, under which the
containment error is uniformly ultimately bounded and the upper bound of the
containment error can be made arbitrarily small, if the subgraph associated
with the followers is undirected and for each follower there exists at least
one leader that has a directed path to that follower. It is noted that the
design of the static controller requires the knowledge of the eigenvalues of
the Laplacian matrix and the upper bounds of the leaders' control inputs. In
order to remove these requirements, a distributed adaptive continuous
controller is further proposed, which can be designed and implemented by each
follower in a fully distributed fashion. Extensions to the case where only
local output information is available are discussed.

the entire subcritical regime, including the ""barely subcritical"" regime, where
the recovery rate exceeds the infection rate by an amount that tends to 0 as $N

the distribution of the extinction time and the total number of cases

the epidemic, and compare to numerical results for a range of parameter values.
We hypothesise that features of the course of the epidemic will be seen in a
wide class of other epidemic models, and we use real data to provide some
tentative and preliminary support for this theory.

alternative of a non-stationary long-memory process. The test procedure works
in the spectral domain and uses a sequence of approximating tvFARIMA models to
estimate the time varying long-range dependence parameter. We prove uniform

These results yield a simple test (based on the quantiles of the standard
normal distribution), and it is demonstrated in a simulation study that -
despite of its semi-parametric nature - the new test outperforms the currently

parametric hypotheses of non-stationarity short- and stationarity long-range

arbitrary number of players. An important question for such nonlocal games is
their behavior under parallel repetition. For two-player nonlocal games, it is
known that both the classical and the non-signaling value of any game converges
to zero exponentially fast under parallel repetition, given that the game is
non-trivial to start with (i.e., has classical/non-signaling value <1). Very
recent results show similar behavior for the quantum value of a two-player game
under parallel repetition. For nonlocal games with three or more players, very
little is known up to present on their behavior under parallel repetition; this
is true for the classical, the quantum and the non-signaling value.
  In this work, we show a parallel repetition theorem for the non-signaling
value of a large class of multi-player games, for an arbitrary number of
players. Our result applies to all multi-player games for which all possible
combinations of questions have positive probability; this class in particular
includes all free games, in which the questions to the players are chosen
independently. Specifically, we prove that if the original game has a
non-signaling value smaller than 1, then the non-signaling value of the
$n$-fold parallel repetition is exponentially small in $n$.
  Our parallel repetition theorem for multi-player games is weaker than the
known parallel repetition results for two-player games in that the rate at
which the non-signaling value of the game decreases not only depends on the
non-signaling value of the original game (and the number of possible
responses), but on the complete description of the game. Nevertheless, we feel
that our result is a first step towards a better understanding of the parallel
repetition of nonlocal games with more than two players.

elongation rate $X_{max}(E)$ and dispersion $\sigma(X_{max})$ as observed with
the Pierre Auger Observatory, several important consequences can be drawn: a)
the injection spectra of nuclei must be very hard, $\sim E^{-\gamma}$ with
$\gamma\sim 1-1.6$; b) the maximum energy of nuclei of charge $Z$ in the

to extremely high energies; c) the fit to the Auger spectrum can be obtained
only at the price of adding an {\it ad hoc} light extragalactic component with
a steep injection spectrum ($\sim E^{-2.7}$). In this sense, at the ankle
($E_{A}\approx 5\times 10^{18}$ eV) all the components are of extragalactic
origin, thereby suggesting that the transition from Galactic to extragalactic
cosmic rays occurs below the ankle. Interestingly, the additional light

and normalization, with the one recently measured by KASCADE-Grande.

information processing systems is widely-observed by researchers to be crucial
for achieving performance improvement upon fusion. Understanding this link
between ensemble diversity and fusion performance is thus an important research
question. However, prior works have theoretically characterized ensemble
diversity and have linked it with ensemble performance in very restricted
settings. We present a generalized ambiguity decomposition (GAD) theorem as a
broad framework for answering these questions. The GAD theorem applies to a
generic convex ensemble of experts for any arbitrary twice-differentiable loss
function. It shows that the ensemble performance approximately decomposes into
a difference of the average expert performance and the diversity of the
ensemble. It thus provides a theoretical explanation for the
empirically-observed benefit of fusing outputs from diverse classifiers and
regressors. It also provides a loss function-dependent, ensemble-dependent, and
data-dependent definition of diversity. We present extensions of this
decomposition to common regression and classification loss functions, and
report a simulation-based analysis of the diversity term and the accuracy of
the decomposition. We finally present experiments on standard pattern
recognition data sets which indicate the accuracy of the decomposition for
real-world classification and regression problems.

although SnTe is closer to the ferroelectric instability, phonon spectra in
PbTe exhibit a more anharmonic character. This behavior is reproduced in
first-principles calculations of the temperature-dependent phonon self-energy.
Our simulations reveal how the nesting of phonon dispersions induces prominent
features in the self-energy, which account for the measured INS spectra and
their temperature dependence. We establish that the phase-space for
three-phonon scattering processes, rather than just the proximity to the
lattice instability, is the mechanism determining the complex spectrum of the
transverse-optical ferroelectric mode.

Such CPGs are neural microcircuits of cells whose synergetic interactions
produce multiple states with distinct phase-locked patterns of bursting
activity. To study biologically plausible CPG models, we develop a suite of
computational tools that reduce the problem of stability and existence of
rhythmic patterns in networks to the bifurcation analysis of fixed points and
invariant curves of a Poincar\'e return maps for phase lags between cells.
  We explore different functional possibilities for motifs involving symmetry
breaking and heterogeneity. This is achieved by varying coupling properties of
the synapses between the cells and studying the qualitative changes in the
structure of the corresponding return maps. Our findings provide a systematic
basis for understanding plausible biophysical mechanisms for the regulation of
rhythmic patterns generated by various CPGs in the context of motor control
such as gait-switching in locomotion. Our analysis does not require knowledge
of the equations modeling the system and provides a powerful qualitative
approach to studying detailed models of rhythmic behavior. Thus, our approach
is applicable to a wide range of biological phenomena beyond motor control.

annihilation cross-sections compared to the single-component DM models. This
results in larger $\gamma$-ray flux in indirect detection experiments of DM. We
illustrate this fact by introducing an extra scalar to the popular single real
scalar DM model. We also present detailed calculations for the vacuum stability
bounds, perturbative unitarity and triviality constraints on this model. As
direct detection experimental results still show some conflict, we kept our
options open, discussing different scenarios with different DM mass zones. In
the framework of our model we make an interesting observation: The existing
direct detection experiments like CDMS II, CoGeNT, CRESST II, XENON 100 or LUX

using a rigorous application of multiple scales perturbation theory. The
governing equations are an asymptotically reduced set of equations that are
derived from the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. These equations are
applicable for rapidly rotating flow regimes and are best suited to describe
anisotropic dynamics of rotating flows. The independent variables of these
equations inherently reside in a helical wave basis that is the most suitable
basis for inertial waves. A coupled system of equations for the two global
invariants: \textit{energy} and \textit{helicity}, is derived by extending a
simpler symmetrical system to the more general non-symmetrical helical case.
This approach of deriving the kinetic equations for helicity follows naturally
by exploiting the symmetries in the system and is different from the
derivations presented in earlier work of \citet{Galtier03, Galtier14} that uses
multiple correlation functions to account for the asymmetry due to helicity.
Stationary solutions, including Kolmogorov solutions, for the flow invariants
are obtained as a scaling law of the anisotropic wave numbers. The scaling law
solutions compare affirmatively with results from recent experimental and
simulation data. The theory developed in this paper pertains to the wave
dynamics supported by an asymptotically reduced set of hydrodynamic equations

equivalence between the Palatini and standard variational field equations

dynamics in both the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstrom black hole spacetimes

dynamics exhibit both saddle-center and transcritical bifurcation points and a
calculation of periastron precession is presented that incorporates a
phase-plane analysis of the relativistic equations of motion. Level curves of
constant energy are illustrated for both timelike and null geodesics and a
phase-plane analysis of dynamical invariance between the proper and coordinate
time reference frames is discussed. The Reissner-Nordstrom dynamics exhibit
saddle-center, transcritical, pseudo-transcritical, and additional bifurcations
that combine all three previous bifurcations in various combinations.
Periastron precession in the Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime is analyzed using the
phase-plane and bifurcation techniques and extended to include a bifurcation
point of the dynamics. A numerical solution at these parameter values
illustrates that such orbits typically yield a much larger precession value
compared to the standard value for timelike, precession. The acausal geodesics
considered by Brigman are also discussed and their precession value is

the performance of researchers, research groups, universities and even

promote personnel, assign research grants and measure the results of research
projects. One particular assessment approach is bibliometrics i.e., the
quantitative analysis of scientific publications through citation and content
analysis. However, there is little consensus today on how research evaluation
should be performed, and it is commonly acknowledged that the quantitative
metrics available today are largely unsatisfactory. A number of different
scientific data sources available on the Web (e.g., DBLP, Google Scholar) that
are used for such analysis purposes. Taking data from these diverse sources,
performing the analysis and visualizing results in different ways is not a
trivial and straight forward task. Moreover, people involved in such evaluation
processes are not always IT experts and hence not capable to crawl data
sources, merge them and compute the needed evaluation procedures. The recent
emergence of mashup tools has refueled research on end-user development, i.e.,
on enabling end-users without programming skills to produce their own
applications. We believe that the heart of the problem is that it is
impractical to design tools that are generic enough to cover a wide range of
application domains, powerful enough to enable the specification of non-trivial
logic, and simple enough to be actually accessible to non-programmers. This
thesis presents a novel approach for an effective end-user development,
specifically for non-programmers. That is, we introduce a domain-specific
approach to mashups that ""speaks the language of users""., i.e., that is aware
of the terminology, concepts, rules, and conventions (the domain) the user is

cavity and a nano- to meso-scale mechanical resonator. The mechanical resonator
is capacitively coupled to the CPT, such that mechanical displacements of the
resonator cause a shift in the CPT inductance and hence the cavity's resonant
frequency. The amplification provided by the CPT is sufficient for the zero
point motion of the mechanical resonator alone to cause a significant change in
the cavity resonance. Conversely, a single photon in the cavity causes a shift
in the mechanical resonator position on the order of its zero point motion. As
a result, the cavity-Cooper pair transistor (cCPT) coupled to a mechanical
resonator will be able to access a regime in which single photons can affect
single phonons and vice versa. Realizing this ultra-strong coupling regime will
facilitate the creation of non-classical states of the mechanical resonator, as
well as the means to accurately characterize such states by measuring the

important to simplify the resulting uncertainty relations and to give the

shown to exhibit excellent analyte detection sensitivity enabling sensing of
analyte concentrations at levels not readily accessible by other methods. One
example where accurate measurement of small concentrations is necessary is
detection of serum biomarkers, such as the recently discovered tumor necrosis
factor receptor superfamily member TROY (TNFRSF19), which may serve as a
biomarker for melanoma. TROY is normally only present in brain but it is
aberrantly expressed in primary and metastatic melanoma cells and shed into the
surrounding environment. In this study, we show the detection of different
concentrations of TROY in buffer solution using top-down fabricated silicon
nanowires. We demonstrate the selectivity of our sensors by comparing the
signal with that obtained from bovine serum albumin in buffer solution. Both
the signal size and the reaction kinetics serve to distinguish the two signals.
Using a fast-mixing two-compartment reaction model, we are able to extract the
association and dissociation rate constants for the reaction of TROY with the
antibody immobilized on the sensor surface.

increasing the detuning can not only induce but also suppress steady state
entanglement, which depends on the value of noise strength. At last, we delimit
the border between presence or absence of steady state entanglement and discuss

eccentricities significantly smaller than the limit imposed by stability

distribution and stability properties in proper element space. We show that the
observed distribution could have been produced by the slow sweeping of the 4/7
mean motion resonance with Neptune that accompanied the end of Neptune's
migration process. The orbital distribution of the hot Kuiper belt is not
significantly affected in this process, for the reasons discussed in the main
text. Therefore, the peculiar eccentricity distribution of the inner cold
population can not be unequivocally interpreted as evidence that the cold
population formed in-situ and was only moderately excited in eccentricity; it
can simply be the signature of Neptune's radial motion, starting from a
moderately eccentric orbit. We discuss how this agrees with a scenario of giant
planet evolution following a dynamical instability and, possibly, with the
radial transport of the cold population.

paper views macroprudential oversight in Europe as a process, a sequence of
activities with the ultimate aim of safeguarding financial stability. To
conceptualize a process in this context, we introduce the notion of a public
collaborative process (PCP). PCPs involve multiple organizations with a common
objective, where a number of dispersed organizations cooperate under various
unstructured forms and take a collaborative approach to reaching the final
goal. We argue that PCPs can and should essentially be managed using the tools
and practices common for business processes. To this end, we conduct an
assessment of process readiness for macroprudential oversight in Europe. Based
upon interviews with key European policymakers and supervisors, we provide an
analysis model to assess the maturity of five process enablers for
macroprudential oversight. With the results of our analysis, we give clear
recommendations on the areas that need further attention when macroprudential
oversight is being developed, in addition to providing a general purpose
framework for monitoring the impact of improvement efforts.

transition metal oxide SrVO3. Here, we review and extend that work, giving not
only a detailed account of full GW+DMFT calculations, but also discussing and
testing simplified approximate schemes. We give insights into the nature of
exchange and correlation effects: Dynamical renormalizations in the Fermi
liquid regime of SrVO3 are essentially local, and nonlocal correlations mainly
act to screen the Fock exchange term. The latter substantially widens the
quasi-particle band structure, while the band narrowing induced by the former
is accompanied by a spectral weight transfer to higher energies. Most
interestingly, the exchange broadening is much more pronounced in the
unoccupied part of spectrum. As a result, the GW+DMFT electronic structure of
SrVO3 resembles the conventional density functional based dynamical mean field
(DFT+DMFT) description for occupied states, but is profoundly modified in the
empty part. Our work leads to a reinterpretation of inverse photoemission
spectroscopy (IPES) data. Indeed, we assign a prominent peak at about 2.7 eV
dominantly to eg states, rather than to an upper Hubbard band of t2g character.
Similar surprises can be expected for other transition metal oxides, calling
for more detailed investigations of the conduction band states.

on a Bayesian framework and devoid of any extra axiom or principle. Quantum
information is construed as a technique for analyzing a logical system subject
to classical constraints, based on a question-and-answer procedure. The problem
is posed from a particular batch of queries while the constraints are
represented by the truth table of a set of Boolean functions. The Bayesian
inference technique consists in assigning a probability distribution within a
real-valued probability space to the joint set of queries in order to satisfy
the constraints. The initial query batch is not unique and alternative batches
can be considered at will. They are enabled mechanically from the initial
batch, quite simply by transcribing the probability space into a Hilbert space.
It turns out that this sole procedure leads to exactly recover the standard
quantum information theory and thus provides an information-theoretic rationale
to its technical rules. In this framework, the great challenges of quantum
mechanics become simple platitudes: Why is the theory probabilistic? Why is the
theory linear? Where does the Hilbert space come from? In addition, most of the
paradoxes, such as uncertainty principle, entanglement, contextuality,
nonsignaling correlation, measurement problem, etc., become straightforwards
features. In the end, our major conclusion is that quantum information is
nothing but classical information processed by a mature form of Bayesian
inference technique and, as such, consubstantial with Aristotelian logic.

diminution during the first stages of embryogenesis. It has been concluded that
available data provide the genetic proof that chromatin diminution is one of
the mechanisms underlying the origin of polymorphism in sugar beet
agamospermous progenies.

wavelet transform arises in a number of fields. These include whether the nodes
of a heat or hypoelliptic equation solution determine its initial conditions,
and in mathematical vision theory the Marr conjecture, on whether an image is
mathematically determined by its edge information. We prove a general version
of this conjecture by reducing it to the moment problem, using a basis dual to
the Taylor monomial basis $x^\alpha$ on $\mathbb {R}^n$.

Einstein's special relativity. By means of this map it is possible to derive
special-relativistic formulas from the corresponding Galilean ones. Beyond
being interesting on its own, this map is also significant with respect to a
recent debate on the extension of relativistic symmetries to the Planck scale
(especially in the framework of the so-called doubly special relativity). The
map in fact provides an explicit example of how can be misleading to interpret
a mathematical correspondence between two relativity schemes as an argument in
favor of their physical equivalence.

effect of ethnic identity, is damaging the stability and harmony of multiethnic
countries. In order to eliminate the foundation of the ethnic separatism and
set up a harmonious ethnic relationship, some scholars have proposed a
viewpoint: ethnic harmony could be promoted by popularizing civic identity.
However, this viewpoint is discussed only from a philosophical prospective and
still lack supports of scientific evidences. Because ethic group and ethnic
identity are products of evolution and ethnic identity is the parochialism
strategy under the perspective of game theory, this paper proposes an
evolutionary game simulation model to study the relationship between civic
identity and ethnic conflict based on evolutionary game theory. The simulation
results indicate that: 1) the ratio of individuals with civic identity has a
positive association with the frequency of ethnic conflicts; 2) ethnic conflict
will not die out by killing all ethnic members once for all, and it also cannot
be reduced by a forcible pressure, i.e., increasing the ratio of individuals
with civic identity; 3) the average frequencies of conflicts can stay in a low
level by promoting civic identity periodically and persistently.

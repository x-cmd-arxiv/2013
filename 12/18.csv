collisions in partially ionized regions with electron densities of a few

Surprisingly, the energy gap for the AFM excitations appears to be very small,

Kornerup in 1999: instead of manipulating single digits, one works with blocks
of fixed length $k$. The aim of this paper is to investigate how such notion
influences the relationship between the base and the cardinality of the
alphabet allowing parallel addition. In this paper, we mainly focus on a
certain class of real bases --- the so-called Parry numbers. We give lower
bounds on the cardinality of alphabets of non-negative integer digits allowing
block parallel addition. By considering quadratic Pisot bases, we are able to
show that these bounds cannot be improved in general and we give explicit
parallel algorithms for addition in these cases. We also consider the
$d$-bonacci base, which satisfies the equation $X^d = X^{d-1} + X^{d-2} +
\cdots + X + 1$. If in a base being a $d$-bonacci number $1$-block parallel
addition is possible on the alphabet $\mathcal{A}$, then $\#\mathcal{A} \geq
d+1$; on the other hand, there exists a $k\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $k$-block
parallel addition in this base is possible on the alphabet $\{0,1,2\}$, which
cannot be reduced. In particular, addition in the Tribonacci base is $14$-block
parallel on alphabet $\{0,1,2\}$.

addition, we find that the loss depends on the fields in a way which allows for

evolution in one quadrature of the phase space. We also study quantitatively
the characteristics of our micro opto-mechanical system as detector of
stochastic force for short measurement times (for quick, high resolution
monitoring) as well as for the longer term observations that optimize the
sensitivity. We compare a simple, naive strategy based on the evaluation of the
variance of the displacement (that is a widely used technique) with an optimal
Wiener-Kolmogorov data analysis. We show that, thanks to the parametric
stabilization of the effective susceptibility, we can more efficiently
implement Wiener filtering, and we investigate how this strategy improves the
performance of our system. We finally demonstrate the possibility to resolve
stochastic force variations well below 1% of the thermal noise.

from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), which is part of the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III). Our results come from the Data Release
11 (DR11) sample, containing nearly one million galaxies and covering
approximately $8\,500$ square degrees and the redshift range $0.2<z<0.7$. We
also compare these results with those from the publicly released DR9 and DR10
samples. Assuming a concordance $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, the DR11
sample covers a volume of 13\,Gpc${}^3$ and is the largest region of the
Universe ever surveyed at this density. We measure the correlation function and
power spectrum, including density-field reconstruction of the baryon acoustic
oscillation (BAO) feature. The acoustic features are detected at a significance
of over $7\,\sigma$ in both the correlation function and power spectrum.
Fitting for the position of the acoustic features measures the distance
relative to the sound horizon at the drag epoch, $r_d$, which has a value of
$r_{d,{\rm fid}}=149.28\,$Mpc in our fiducial cosmology. We find
$D_V=(1264\pm25\,{\rm Mpc})(r_d/r_{d,{\rm fid}})$ at $z=0.32$ and
$D_V=(2056\pm20\,{\rm Mpc})(r_d/r_{d,{\rm fid}})$ at $z=0.57$. At 1.0 per cent,
this latter measure is the most precise distance constraint ever obtained from
a galaxy survey. Separating the clustering along and transverse to the
line-of-sight yields measurements at $z=0.57$ of $D_A=(1421\pm20\,{\rm
Mpc})(r_d/r_{d,{\rm fid}})$ and $H=(96.8\pm3.4\,{\rm km/s/Mpc})(r_{d,{\rm

A jump of temperature from 0.01 to 1 MK is observed near the 2 Mm heights and
higher, further producing a permanent solar wind flow. The heating processes
responsible for this temperature jump and for the flow are not yet fully

the effects of the turbulence-level broad variations on the orientations of the

defined as the power in the transverse field fluctuations normalized to the
medium-scale average background field, tightly orders the location of the peaks
in the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the angles between local
fields and Parker spiral. As a result, the broad variations in the power level
of turbulence cause a steep dependence of the average power level of turbulence
on the angle of the local field to the Parker spiral, with the highest
turbulence levels found near the normal to the Parker spiral and the lowest
levels near the Parker spiral direction. Generalized quasilinear estimates of
the mean cross-field displacements adapted to intermittent time-varying
turbulence lead to accurate fits of the observed angle PDFs at all stable
levels of turbulence, supporting the idea that isotropic turbulence could
account for the observed angle PDFs. Modeling of the angles alpha_r between
local fields and radial direction, from the PDFs of the angles alpha between
local and background fields under an assumption of axisymmetry of the turbulent
fields around a background field in or near the direction of the Parker spiral,
also produces fairly good fits of the observed PDFs of alpha_r, thereby
validating the assumption. Finally, local field reversals are found to be quite
common even within very broad streams of ""unipolar"" fast solar wind.

internal angular momentum (spin). The magnetic interaction between two
electrons can therefore impose a change in their spin orientation. This
process, however, was never observed in experiment. The challenge is two-fold.
At the atomic scale, where the coupling is relatively large, the magnetic
interaction is often overshadowed by the much larger coulomb exchange
counterpart. In typical situations where exchange is negligible, magnetic
interactions are also very weak and well below ambient magnetic noise. Here we
report on the first measurement of the magnetic interaction between two
electronic spins. To this end, we used the ground state valence electrons of
two $^{88}$Sr$^+$ ions, co-trapped in an electric Paul trap and separated by
more than two micrometers. We measured the weak, millihertz scale
(alternatively $10^{-18}$ eV or $10^{-14}$ K), magnetic interaction between
their electronic spins. This, in the presence of magnetic noise that was six
orders of magnitude larger than the respective magnetic fields the electrons
apply on each other. Cooperative spin dynamics was kept coherent for 15 s
during which spin-entanglement was generated. The sensitivity necessary for
this measurement was provided by restricting the spin evolution to a
Decoherence-Free Subspace (DFS) which is immune to collective magnetic field
noise. Finally, by varying the separation between the two ions, we were able to
recover the inverse cubic distance dependence of the interaction. The reported
method suggests an alternative route to the search of long-range anomalous
spin-spin forces and can be generalized to include Quantum Error Correction
codes for other cases of extremely weak signal detection.

$\Sigma_{NS}$ captures the no-spinning condition only and the second rolling
motion $\Sigma_{R}$ corresponds to rolling without spinning nor slipping. Two
distributions of dimensions $(n + \hn)$ and $n$, respectively, are then
associated to the rolling motions $\Sigma_{NS}$ and $\Sigma_{R}$ respectively.
This generalizes the rolling problems considered in \cite{ChitourKokkonen1}
where both manifolds had the same dimension. The controllability issue is then
addressed for both $\Sigma_{NS}$ and $\Sigma_{R}$ and completely solved for
$\Sigma_{NS}$. As regards to $\Sigma_{R}$, basic properties for the reachable
sets are provided as well as the complete study of the case $(n,\hn)=(3,2)$ and
some sufficient conditions for non-controllability.

mass matrices by a complete set of delta^XY_ij (X,Y=L,R; i,j= t,c,u or b,s,d
for squarks/1,2,3 for sleptons). With respect to the squark sector, we study
the behaviour of the B-physics observables BR(B -> Xs gamma), BR(Bs -> mu+ mu-)

them. We present one-loop corrections to the Higgs boson masses in the MSSM
with NMFV in the squark sector, and taking into account the previous
constraints we evaluate them, finding sizable corrections, exceeding sometimes
tens of GeV for the light Higgs boson. These corrections might be used to set
further constraints on the delta parameters from the Higgs boson mass
measurement. With respect to the slepton sector, we explore the implications on
charged lepton flavour violating (LFV) processes. The present upper bounds on
the most relevant LFV processes and the recent LHC and (g-2)_mu data lead to
updated constraints on all slepton flavour mixing parameters. We also study the
LFV Higgs decays h,H, A -> tau mu considering the relevant types of slepton
mixing (LL23, LR23, RL23, RR23) in the context of a heavy SUSY with a scale
into the multi-TeV range. These observables present a non-decoupling behaviour
with mSUSY, and are shown here to remain constant as mSUSY grows, for large
mSUSY> 2 TeV values and for all the mixings considered. We show that all the
three channels could be measurable at the LHC even in these heavy SUSY
scenarios, being h -> tau mu the most promising one, with up to about hundred
of events expected with the current LHC centre-of-mass energy and luminosity.
The most promising predictions for the future LHC stage are also included.

gravitational attraction, in case of quintessence or phantom dark energy,
respectively, that satisfy a linear equation of state. Stability is studied for
microcanonical (fixed energy) and canonical (fixed temperature) ensembles.
Compared to the previously studied cosmological constant case, in the present
work it is found that quintessence increases, while phantom dark energy
decreases the instability domain under gravitational collapse. Thus, structures
are more easily formed in a quintessence rather than in a phantom dominated
Universe. Assuming that galaxy clusters are spherical, nearly isothermal and in
hydrostatic equilibrium we find that dark energy with a linear and constant
equation of state, for fixed radius, mass and temperature, steepens their total

simulate the time evolution of classical solid and molecular systems when
considering general non-equilibrium processes. In this approach, a part of the
whole system (an open system), which interacts and exchanges energy with its
dissipative environment, is studied. Because the GLE is derived by projecting
out exactly the harmonic environment, the coupling to it is realistic, while
the equations of motion are non-Markovian. Although the GLE formalism has
already found promising applications, e.g., in nanotribology and as a powerful
thermostat for equilibration in classical molecular dynamics simulations,
efficient algorithms to solve the GLE for realistic memory kernels are highly
non-trivial, especially if the memory kernels decay non-exponentially. This is
due to the fact that one has to generate a colored noise and take account of
the memory effects in a consistent manner. In this contribution, we present a
simple, yet efficient, algorithm for solving the GLE for practical memory

investigate the transport of droplets on asymmetrically structured (saw-tooth

vibrations and the asymmetry of its topography, the droplets are driven in a
preferred direction. We study this directed motion as a function of the size of
the droplets, the linear dimensions of the substrate corrugation, and the
period of vibrations.
  Two mechanisms of driven transport are identified: (i) one that relies on the
droplet's contact lines and (ii), in a range of vibration periods, the entire
contact area contributes to the driving. In this latter regime, the set-up may
be used in experiments for sorting droplets according to their size.
Additionally, we show that the linear dimension of the substrate corrugation
affects the flux inside the droplet. While on a substrate with a fine
corrugation droplets mostly slide, on a more coarsely corrugated substrate the
flux may exhibit an additional rotation pattern.

indicator, a measure of stochastic variation (essentially equivalent to the
Fano factor and Mandel's Q parameter), for various renewal (memoryless)

without assuming all steps follow Poissonian kinetics. Based upon fitting to
the functional forms of the first two waiting time moments, we show that, to
second order, the non-Poissonian kinetics are generally underdetermined but can
be specified in certain scenarios. For an enzymatic reaction with an arbitrary
intermediate topology, we identify a generic minimum of the Poisson indicator
as a function of substrate concentration, which can be used to tune substrate
concentration to the stochastic fluctuations and estimate the largest number of
underlying consecutive links in a turnover cycle. We identify a local maximum
of the Poisson indicator (with respect to substrate concentration) for a
renewal process as a signature of competitive binding, either between a
substrate and an inhibitor or between multiple substrates. Our analysis
explores the rich connections between Poisson indicator measurements and

functions of the nearest-neighbor coupling and the anisotropy constants. We
find two longitudinal modes due to the non-collinear nature of the triangular
antiferromagnetic order, similar to that of the phenomenological field theory
approach by Affleck. We compare our results for the longitudinal energy gaps at

an interval order on the interval-valued ranks. The concept of rank width
arises naturally, allowing us to identify the poset region with point-valued
width as its longest graded portion (which we call the ""spindle""). A standard
interval rank function is naturally motivated both in terms of its extremality

having already reached the level of a precision observable with an experimental
accuracy of about 500 MeV, plays an important role in this context. In the MSSM
the mass of the light CP-even Higgs boson, M_h, can directly be predicted from
the other parameters of the model. The accuracy of this prediction should at
least match the one of the experimental result. The relatively high mass value
of about 126 GeV has led to many investigations where the scalar top quarks are
in the multi-TeV range. We improve the prediction for M_h in the MSSM by
combining the existing fixed-order result, comprising the full one-loop and
leading and subleading two-loop corrections, with a resummation of the leading
and subleading logarithmic contributions from the scalar top sector to all
orders. In this way for the first time a high-precision prediction for the mass
of the light CP-even Higgs boson in the MSSM is possible all the way up to the
multi-TeV region of the relevant supersymmetric particles. The results are

Because metallicities control opacities, they are one of the important
environmental parameters which affect star formation processes. In this work, I
investigate protostellar collapse in solar-metallicity and low-metallicity ($Z
= 0.1 Z_\odot$) environments using 3D radiation hydrodynamic and
magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Because radiation cooling is more effective in
the low-metallicity environments, first cores are colder and have lower
entropies. As a result, first cores are smaller, less massive and have shorter
lifetimes in the low-metallicity clouds. Therefore, first cores would be less
likely to be found in low-metallicity star forming clouds. This also implies
that first cores tend to be more gravitationally unstable and susceptible to
fragmentation. The evolution and structure of protostellar cores formed after
the second collapse weakly depend on metallicities in the spherical and
magnetized models despite the large difference in the metallicities. Because
this is due to the change of the heat capacity by dissociation and ionization
of hydrogen, it is a general consequence of the second collapse as long as the
effects of radiation cooling are not very large during the second collapse. On
the other hand, the effects of different metallicities are more significant in
the rotating models without magnetic fields, because they evolve slower than
other models and therefore more affected by radiation cooling.

first stars hold the promise of becoming a high-precision cosmological probe in
the future. The growth of over densities is very well described by perturbation
theory at that epoch and the signal can in principle be predicted to arbitrary
accuracy for given cosmological parameters. Recently, Tseliakhovich and Hirata
pointed out a previously neglected and important physical effect, due to the
fact that baryons and cold dark matter (CDM) have supersonic relative
velocities after recombination. This relative velocity suppresses the growth of
matter fluctuations on scales $k \sim 10-10^3$ Mpc$^{-1}$. In addition, the
amplitude of the small-scale power spectrum is modulated on the large scales
over which the relative velocity varies, corresponding to $k \sim 0.005-1$
Mpc$^{-1}$. In this paper, the effect of the relative velocity on 21 cm
brightness temperature fluctuations from redshifts $z \geq 30$ is computed. We
show that the 21 cm power spectrum is affected on ${\it most}$ scales. On small
scales, the signal is typically suppressed several tens of percent, except for
extremely small scales ($k \gtrsim 2000$ Mpc$^{-1}$) for which the fluctuations
are boosted by resonant excitation of acoustic waves. On large scales, 21 cm
fluctuations are enhanced due to the non-linear dependence of the brightness
temperature on the underlying gas density and temperature. The enhancement of
the 21 cm power spectrum is of a few percent at $k \sim 0.1$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and up
to tens of percent at $k \lesssim 0.005$ Mpc$^{-1}$, for standard $\Lambda$CDM
cosmology. In principle this effect allows to probe the small-scale matter
power spectrum not only through a measurement of small angular scales but also
through its effect on large angular scales.

expected error of the ESA space astrometry mission Gaia. We demonstrate the
process of constructing mock Gaia data from an N-body model, including the
conversion of a galactocentric Cartesian coordinate N-body model into
equatorial coordinates and how to add error to it for a single stellar type. We
then describe the modifications made to PRIMAL to work with observational
error. This paper demonstrates that PRIMAL can recover the radial profiles of
the surface density, radial velocity dispersion, vertical velocity dispersion
and mean rotational velocity of the target disc, along with the pattern speed
of the bar, to a reasonable degree of accuracy despite the lack of accurate
target data. We also construct mock data which take into account dust
extinction and show that PRIMAL recovers the structure and kinematics of the
disc reasonably well. In other words, the expected accuracy of the Gaia data is
good enough for PRIMAL to recover these global properties of the disc, at least
in a simplified condition, as used in this paper.

M~10^11M_Sun galaxies at z~4 with suppressed star formation rates (SFRs),
selected on rest-frame optical to near-IR colors from the FourStar Galaxy
Evolution Survey. The observed spectral energy distributions show pronounced
breaks, sampled by a set of near-IR medium-bandwidth filters, resulting in
tightly constrained photometric redshifts. Fitting stellar population models
suggests large Balmer/4000AA breaks, relatively old stellar populations, large
stellar masses and low SFRs, with a median specific SFR of 2.9+/-1.8 x
10^-11/yr. Ultradeep Herschel/PACS 100micron, 160micron and Spitzer/MIPS
24micron data reveal no dust-obscured SFR activity for 15/19 (79%) galaxies.
Two far-IR detected galaxies are obscured QSOs. Stacking the far-IR undetected
galaxies yields no detection, consistent with the SED fit, indicating
independently that the average specific SFR is at least 10x smaller than of
typical star-forming galaxies at z~4. Assuming all far-IR undetected galaxies
are indeed quiescent, the volume density is 1.8+/-0.7 x 10^-5Mpc^-3 to a limit
of log10M/M_Sun>10.6, which is 10x and 80x lower than at z = 2 and z = 0.1.
They comprise a remarkably high fraction (~35%) of z~4 massive galaxies,
suggesting that suppression of star formation was efficient even at very high
redshift. Given the average stellar age of 0.8Gyr and stellar mass of
0.8x10^11M_Sun, the galaxies likely started forming stars before z =5, with
SFRs well in excess of 100M_Sun/yr, far exceeding that of similarly abundant
UV-bright galaxies at z>4. This suggests that most of the star-formation in the
progenitors of quiescent z~4 galaxies was obscured by dust.

$\sim1.5\times10^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ (orbital timescale, averaging

unpublished. This population is characterized by short (a few hundred seconds)
and relatively bright (in excess of 100mCrab, 15-50keV) events. In the hard
X-ray, these flares last in general much less than a day. Clustering of hard
X-ray flares can be used to indirectly measure the length of an outburst, even
when the low-level emission is not detected. We construct the distributions of
flares, of their significance (in terms of sigma) and their flux as a function
of orbital phase, to infer the properties of these binary systems. In
particular, we observe a trend of clustering of flares at some phases as
$P_{\rm orb}$ increases, as consistent with a progression from tight, circular

at longer orbital periods. Finally, we estimate the expected number of flares
for a given source for our limiting flux and provide the recipe for calculating
them for the limiting flux of future hard X-ray observatories. (Abridged).

parameterize optical variability by the characteristic damping timescale
($\tau$) and variability amplitude. By virtue of distinguishable variability
parameters of AGNs, we are able to select them with high completeness of 93.4%

select highly variable blazar candidates, whose infrared colors are consistent

selected AGN candidates, we probe the optical variability of X-ray detected

to select various types of host-dominated AGNs. Contrary to the AGN unification

to the product $\sqrt{\zeta_x^2(w+1)}$ where $\zeta_x$ is a coupling constant
between a rolling scalar field responsible for the acceleration of the
expansion of the universe and the electromagnetic field with x standing for
either $\mu$ or $\alpha$. The dark energy equation of state $w$ can assume
values different than $-1$ in cosmologies where the acceleration of the
expansion is due to a scalar field. In this case the value of both $\mu$ and
$\alpha$ changes with time. The values of the fundamental constants, therefore,
monitor the equation of state and are a valuable tool for determining $w$ as a
function of redshift. In fact the rolling of the fundamental constants is one
of the few definitive discriminators between acceleration due to a cosmological
constant and acceleration due to a quintessence rolling scalar field. $w$ is
often given in parameterized form for comparison with observations. In this
manuscript the predicted evolution of $\mu$, is calculated for a range of
parameterized equation of state models and compared to the observational
constraints on $\Delta \mu / \mu$. We find that the current limits on $\Delta
\mu / \mu$ place significant constraints on linear equation of state models and
on thawing models where $w$ deviates from $-1$ at late times. They also
constrain non-dynamical models that have a constant $w$ not equal to $-1$.
These constraints are an important compliment to geometric tests of $w$ in that
geometric tests are sensitive to the evolution of the universe before the epoch
of observation while fundamental constants are sensitive to the evolution of
the universe after the observational epoch. Abstract truncated.

regions during the late epoch of reionization. In the ""bubble model"" of
reionization, the mass distribution of large ionized regions (""bubbles"") during
the early stage of reionization is obtained by using the excursion set model,
where the ionization of a region corresponds to the first up-crossing of a
barrier by random trajectories. We generalize this idea, and develop a method
to predict the distribution of large scale neutral regions during the late
stage of reionization, taking into account the ionizing background after the
percolation of HII regions. The large scale neutral regions which we call
""neutral islands"" are not individual galaxies or minihalos, but larger regions
where fewer galaxies formed and hence ionized later, and they are identified in
the excursion set model with the first down-crossings of the island barrier.
Assuming that the consumption rate of ionizing background photons is
proportional to the surface area of the neutral islands, we obtained the size
distribution of the neutral islands. We also take the ""bubbles-in-island""
effect into account by considering the conditional probability of up-crossing a
bubble barrier after down-crossing the island barrier. We find that this effect
is very important. An additional barrier is set to avoid islands being
percolated through. We find that there is a characteristic scale for the
neutral islands, while the small islands are rapidly swallowed up by the
ionizing background, this characteristic scale does not change much as the
reionization proceeds.

The aim of this study is to illustrate the effects of varying the maximum

simulated haloes range from $\rm{T} \sim 10000\ \rm{K} - 16000\ \rm{K}$ and
they have virial masses in the range $\rm{M} \sim 2 \times 10^7 \rm{M_{\odot}}$
to $\rm{M} \sim 7 \times 10^7 \rm{M_{\odot}}$ at $z \sim 15$. The outcome of
our six fiducial simulations is both generic and robust. A rotationally
supported, marginally gravitationally stable, disk forms with an exponential
profile. The mass and scale length of this disk depends strongly on the maximum
refinement level used. Varying the maximum refinement level by factors between
1 / 64 to 256 times the fiducial level illustrates the care that must be taken
in interpreting the results. The lower resolution simulations show tentative
evidence that the gas may become rotationally supported out to 20 pc while the
highest resolution simulations show only weak evidence of rotational support
due to the shorter dynamical times for which the simulation runs. The higher
resolution simulations do, however, point to fragmentation at small scales of
the order of $\sim 100$ AU. In the highest resolution simulations a central
object of a few times $10^2\ \rm{M_{\odot}}$ forms with multiple strongly

star-formation rates are then combined with those inferred from the Ly$\alpha$
and UV emission to determine lower limits on the LAEs Ly$\alpha$ escape
fraction ($f_{\rm esc}($Ly$\alpha$)). For the Sd SED template, the inferred
LAEs $f_{\rm esc}($Ly$\alpha$) are $\gtrsim30%$ ($1\sigma$) at z=2.8, 3.1 and
4.5, which are all significantly higher than the global $f_{\rm
esc}($Ly$\alpha$) at these redshifts. Thus, if the LAEs $f_{\rm
esc}($Ly$\alpha$) follows the global evolution then they have warmer
far-infrared SEDs than the Sd galaxy template. The average and M82 SEDs produce
lower limits on the LAE $f_{\rm esc}($Ly$\alpha$) of ~10 to 20% ($1\sigma$),
all of which are slightly higher than the global evolution of $f_{\rm
esc}($Ly$\alpha$) but consistent with it at the 2 to 3$\sigma$ level.

consistent with recent results from K-selected samples, which provide a better

GSMF in excess of the GSMF observed. By combining the simulated SFR(M*)

objects (jets, leptons) along with large missing transverse energy to separate
New Physics from Standard Model hard processes. We consider a class of
``double-invisible'' SUSY scenarios: where squarks, stops and sbottoms have a
three-body decay into two (rather than one) invisible final-state particles.
This occurs naturally when the LSP carries an additional conserved quantum
number under which other superpartners are not charged. In these topologies,
the available energy is diluted into invisible particles, reducing the observed
missing energy and visible energy. This can lead to sizable changes in the
sensitivity of existing searches, dramatically changing the qualitative
constraints on superpartners. In particular, for m_LSP>160 GeV, we find no
robust constraints from the LHC at any squark mass for any generation, while
for lighter LSPs we find significant reductions in constraints. If confirmed by
a full reanalysis from the collaborations, such scenarios allow for the
possibility of significantly more natural SUSY models. While not realized in
the MSSM, such phenomenology occurs naturally in models with mixed sneutrinos,
Dirac gauginos and NMSSM-like models.

binary systems. In a resonance lock, a given stellar or planetary mode is
trapped in a highly resonant state for an extended period of time, during which
the spin and orbital frequencies vary in concert to maintain the resonance.
This phenomenon is qualitatively similar to resonance capture in planetary
dynamics. We show that resonance locks can accelerate the course of tidal
evolution in eccentric systems and also efficiently couple spin and orbital
evolution in circular binaries. Previous analyses of resonance locking have not
treated the mode amplitude as a fully dynamical variable, but rather assumed
the adiabatic (i.e. Lorentzian) approximation valid only in the limit of
relatively strong mode damping. We relax this approximation, analytically
derive conditions under which the fixed point associated with resonance locking
is stable, and further check these analytic results using numerical
integrations of the coupled mode, spin, and orbital evolution equations. These
show that resonance locking can sometimes take the form of complex limit cycles
or even chaotic trajectories. We provide simple analytic formulae that define
the binary and mode parameter regimes in which resonance locks of some kind
occur (stable, limit cycle, or chaotic). We briefly discuss the astrophysical
implications of our results for white dwarf and neutron star binaries as well
as eccentric stellar binaries.

luminosity. Based on this sample we find a clear colour-magnitude relation
(CMR) at z~5, such that the rest-frame UV slopes (beta) of brighter galaxies
are notably redder than their fainter counterparts. We determine that the z~5
CMR is well described by a linear relationship of the form: d beta = (-0.12 +/-
0.02) d Muv, with no clear evidence for a change in CMR slope at faint
magnitudes (i.e. Muv > -18.9). Using the results of detailed simulations we are
able, for the first time, to infer the intrinsic (i.e. free from noise)
variation of galaxy colours around the CMR at z~5. We find significant (12
sigma) evidence for intrinsic colour variation in the sample as a whole. Our
results also demonstrate that the width of the intrinsic UV slope distribution
of z~5 galaxies increases from Delta(beta)=0.1 at Muv=-18 to Delta(beta)=0.4 at
Muv=-21. We suggest that the increasing width of the intrinsic galaxy colour
distribution and the CMR itself are both plausibly explained by a luminosity

shedding does not occur at the current spin period (5.385 hr) and cannot
directly initiate the formation of the satellites. On the other hand, this body
may be close to structural failure; in particular, the neck may be situated
near a plastic state. In addition, the neck's sensitivity to structural failure
changes as the body size varies. We conclude that plastic deformation has
probably occurred around the neck part in the past. If the true size of this

then fallback disks around NSs, even for low-metallicity main sequence stars,
are not an outcome of SN explosions. Formation of such disks around young NSs
can only happen under the condition of negligible magnetic torques and a
fine-tuned explosion energy. For those stars which leave behind BH remnants,
disk formation is ubiquitous if magnetic fields do not play a strong role;
however, unlike the NS case, even with strong magnetic coupling in the
interior, a disk can form in a large region of the {Z,M,vsurf,E} parameter
space. Together with the compact, hyperaccreting fallback disks widely
discussed in the literature, we identify regions in the above parameter space
which lead to extended, long-lived disks around BHs. We find that the physical
conditions in these disks may be conducive to planet formation, hence leading
to the possible existence of planets orbiting black holes.

not combine significantly when compared to statistical error of the BAO
measurement. Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)-III Baryon Oscillation

measurement with $\sim 1\%$ statistical error and this prompts an extensive
search for all possible sub-percent level systematic errors which could be
safely ignored previously. In this paper, we analyze the potential systematics
in BAO fitting methodology using mocks and data from BOSS DR10 and DR11. We
demonstrate the robustness of the fiducial multipole fitting methodology to be
at $0.1\%-0.2\%$ level with a wide range of tests in mock galaxy catalogs pre-
and post-reconstruction. We also find the DR10 and DR11 data from BOSS to be
robust against changes in methodology at similar level. This systematic error
budget is incorporated into the the error budget of Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) DR10 and DR11 BAO measurements. Of the wide range
of changes we have investigated, we find that when fitting pre-reconstructed

values of distance measurements both parallel and perpendicular to the line of
sight: (a) Changes in non-linear correlation function template; (b) Changes in
fitting range of the correlation function; (c) Changes to the non-linear
damping model parameters. The priors applied do not matter in the estimates of
the fitted errors as long as we restrict ourselves to physically meaningful

repetitively (cyclically) and the change is assumed to take place at an unknown
time moment in a distant-future stationary regime. Specifically, the proposed
method is based on the integral-equations approach and uses the collocation
technique with the basis functions chosen so as to exploit a certain
change-of-measure identity and the GSR detection statistic's unique martingale
property. As a result, the method's accuracy and robustness improve, as does
its efficiency since using the change-of-measure ploy the Average Run Length
(ARL) to false alarm and the Stationary Average Detection Delay (STADD) are
computed simultaneously. We show that the method's rate of convergence is
quadratic and supply a tight upperbound on its error. We conclude with a case
study and confirm experimentally that the proposed method's accuracy and rate
of convergence are robust with respect to three factors: (a) partition fineness
(coarse vs. fine), (b) change magnitude (faint vs. contrast), and (c) the level
of the ARL to false alarm (low vs. high). Since the method is designed not
restricted to a particular data distribution or to a specific value of the GSR
detection statistic's headstart, this work may help gain greater insight into
the characteristics of the GSR procedure and aid a practitioner to design the
GSR procedure as needed while fully utilizing its potential.

between the fully supervised and unsupervised setting. Instead of supervision,
we provide input features for each source signal and use convex methods to
estimate the correlations between these features and the unobserved signal
decomposition. We analyze the case of $\ell_2$ loss theoretically and show that
recovery of the signal components depends only on cross-correlation between
features for different signals, not on correlations between features for the
same signal. Contextually supervised source separation is a natural fit for
domains with large amounts of data but no explicit supervision; our motivating
application is energy disaggregation of hourly smart meter data (the separation
of whole-home power signals into different energy uses). Here we apply
contextual supervision to disaggregate the energy usage of thousands homes over
four years, a significantly larger scale than previously published efforts, and
demonstrate on synthetic data that our method outperforms the unsupervised

challenging task that involves a number of complicated procedures. We study in
detail the systematic errors in the measurement of weak lensing Minkowski
Functionals (MFs). Specifically, we focus on systematics associated with galaxy
shape measurements, photometric redshift errors, and shear calibration
correction. We first generate mock weak-lensing catalogs that directly
incorporate the actual observational characteristics of the
Canada-France-Hawaii Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). We then perform a Fisher
analysis using the large set of mock catalogs for various cosmological models.
We find that the statistical error associated with the observational effects
degrades the cosmological parameter constraints by a factor of a few. The
Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey with a sky coverage of ~1400 deg2 will
constrain the dark energy equation of the state parameter with an error of
Delta w_0 ~ 0.25 by the lensing MFs alone, but biases induced by the
systematics can be comparable to the 1-sigma error. We conclude that the
lensing MFs are powerful statistics beyond the two-point statistics, only if
well-calibrated measurement of both the redshifts and the shapes of source
galaxies is performed. Finally, we analyze the CFHTLenS data to explore the
ability of the MFs to break degeneracies between a few cosmological parameters.
Using a combined analysis of the MFs and the shear correlation function, we
derive the matter density Omega_m0= 0.256+0.054-0.046.

from one or more drawbacks, including bootstrapping from either only known
benign or known Sybil nodes, failing to tolerate noise in their prior knowledge
about known benign or Sybil nodes, and being not scalable.
  In this work, we aim to overcome these drawbacks. Towards this goal, we
introduce SybilBelief, a semi-supervised learning framework, to detect Sybil
nodes. SybilBelief takes a social network of the nodes in the system, a small
set of known benign nodes, and, optionally, a small set of known Sybils as
input. Then SybilBelief propagates the label information from the known benign
and/or Sybil nodes to the remaining nodes in the system.
  We evaluate SybilBelief using both synthetic and real world social network
topologies. We show that SybilBelief is able to accurately identify Sybil nodes
with low false positive rates and low false negative rates. SybilBelief is
resilient to noise in our prior knowledge about known benign and Sybil nodes.
Moreover, SybilBelief performs orders of magnitudes better than existing Sybil
classification mechanisms and significantly better than existing Sybil ranking
mechanisms.

energy gap are virtually constant across the main portions of GLs, although
their values strongly depend on the voltages and recombination parameters. In
contrast, the electron and hole scattering on disorder lead to substantial
nonuniformities. The resonant inter-GL tunneling enables N-shaped
current-voltage characteristics provided that GLs are sufficiently short. The
width of the current maxima is much larger than the broadening of the tunneling
resonance. In the double-GL structures with relatively long GLs the N-shaped
characteristics transform into the Z-shaped characteristics. % The obtained

equation that defines in probability space the smooth path of Steepest Entropy
Ascent (SEA) connecting an arbitrary initial probability distribution to the
unique Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) distribution with the same mean values of a set
of constraints. The SEA path is relative to a metric chosen to measure
distances in square-root probability distribution space. Along the resulting
SAE path, the metric turns out to be proportional to the concept of Onsager
resistivity generalized to the far non-equilibrium domain. The length of the
SEA path to MaxEnt provides a novel global measure of degree of disequilibrium
(DoD) of the initial probability distribution, whereas a local measure of DoD
is given by the norm of a novel generalized concept of non-equilibrium
affinity.

has been considered previously under the general title of parallel rigidity

specially tailored to overcome the clustering phenomenon. We further identify
the implications of parallel rigidity theory for the location estimation

location recovery results. We also formulate an alternating direction method to
solve the resulting semidefinite program, and provide a distributed version of
our formulation for large numbers of locations. Specifically for the camera
location estimation problem, we formulate a pairwise line estimation method
based on robust camera orientation and subspace estimation. Lastly, we

two sets of loops. Hinode/EIS spectroscopic observations reveal blueshifts at
the feet of both sets of loops. The evolution and dynamics of the two sets are
quite different. The first set of loops exhibits blueshifts for about 25
minutes followed by redshifts, while the second set shows stronger blueshifts,
which are maintained for about one hour. The UV 1600 observation by AIA also
shows that the feet of the second set of loops brighten twice. These suggest
that continuous heating may be present in the second set of loops. We use
spatially resolved UV light curves to infer heating rates in the few tens of
individual loops comprising the two loop systems. With these heating rates, we
then compute plasma evolution in these loops with the ""enthalpy-based thermal
evolution of loops"" (EBTEL) model. The results show that, for the first set of
loops, the synthetic EUV light curves from the model compare favorably with the
observed light curves in six AIA channels and eight EIS spectral lines, and the
computed mean enthalpy flow velocities also agree with the Doppler shift
measurements by EIS. For the second set of loops modeled with twice-heating,
there are some discrepancies between modeled and observed EUV light curves in
low-temperature bands, and the model does not fully produce the prolonged
blueshift signatures as observed. We discuss possible causes for the
discrepancies.

Furthermore, the usual students' programming tasks are of a size that either
one student or a small group of students can manage the work. Comprehensive
processes being essential for large companies in terms of reflecting the
organization structure, coordinating teams, or interfaces to business processes
such as contracting or sales, are complex and hard to teach in a lecture, and,
therefore, often out of scope. We experienced tutorials on using Java or C#, or
on developing applications for the iPhone to gather more attention by students,
simply speaking, as these are more fun for them. So, why should students spend
their time in software processes? From our experiences and the discussions with
a variety of industrial partners, we learned that students often face trouble
when taking their first ""real"" jobs, even if the company is organized in a lean
or agile shape. Therefore, we propose to include software processes more
explicitly into the SE curricula. We designed and implemented a course at
Master's level in which students learn why software processes are necessary,
and how they can be analyzed, designed, implemented, and continuously improved.

filling factor tends to {\nu} = 1 and is proportional to the hyperfine
coupling, similar to the usual Knight shift versus {\nu}-dependence. The peak
frequency shifts linearly with magnetic field throughout the studied filling
factor range and matches the unshifted substrate signal, detected by classical
NMR. Thus, the evolution of the splitting is entirely due to the changing
Knight shift of the dip feature. The nuclear spin relaxation time, T1, is

relation between the propagators in the background gauge at finite temperature

to know if the non-Debye specific heat can be accounted for in terms of

ions and the non-Debye specific heat of mixed salts (e.g.
(NH$_{4})_{x}$Rb$_{1-x}$Br) of ammonium and alkali halides which are known to
exhibit dipolar glass phase. We have measured specific heat of above mixed
salts at low temperatures (1.5 K $< T <$ 15 K). It is seen that while the
specific heat of pure salts obeys Debye law, the specific heat of mixed salts
does not obey Debye law. We have studied the effect of the NH$_{4}^{+}$ ion
concentration, first neighbor environment of NH$_{4}^{+}$ ion and the lattice
strain field on the non-Debye specific heat by carrying out measurements on
suitably chosen mixed salts. Independent of above, we have measured the
rotational tunneling spectra, $f(\omega $), of the NH$_{4}^{+}$ ions in above
salts using technique of neutron incoherent inelastic scattering. The above
studies show that both the non-Debye specific heat and the tunneling spectra of
the NH$_{4}^{+}$ ions depend on the NH$_{4}^{+}$ ion concentration, first
neighbor environment of NH$_{4}^{+}$ ions and the lattice strain field. We have
further shown that the temperature dependence of the measured specific heat can
be explained for all the samples in terms of a model that takes account of
contributions to the specific heat from the Debye phonons and the rotational
tunneling states of the NH$_{4}^{+}$ ions. To the best of our knowledge, this
is a first study where it is shown that measured specific heat of

information, for that matter. A prominent example is non-locality. Non-local
correlations cannot be explained, in classical terms, by shared information but
only by communication. On the other hand, the phenomenon does not allow for
(potentially faster-than-light) message transmission. The fact that some
non-local and non-signaling correlations are predicted by quantum theory,
whereas others fail to be, asks for a criterion, as simple as possible, that
characterizes which joint input-output behaviors are ``quantum'' and which are
not. In the context of the derivation of such criteria, it is of central
importance to understand when non-local correlations can be amplified by a
non-interactive protocol, i.e., whether some types of weak non-locality can be
distilled into stronger by local operations. Since it has been recognized that
the searched-for criteria must inherently be multi-partite, the question of
distillation, extensively studied and understood two-party scenarios, should be
adressed in the multi-user setting, where much less is known. Considering the
space of intrinsically n-partite correlations, we show the possibility of
distilling weak non-local boxes to the algebraically maximal ones without any
communication. Our protocols improve on previously known methods which still
required partial communication. The price we have to pay for dropping the need
for communication entirely is the assumption of permutation invariance: Any
correlation that can be realized between some set of players is possible
between any such set. This assumption is very natural since the laws of physics
are invariant under spacial translation.

bijections to vector spaces; informally, one can view this as a sequence of
$S_n$-modules. A Hopf monoid (in the category of vector species) consists of a
vector species with unit, counit, product, and coproduct morphisms satisfying
several compatibility conditions, analogous to a graded Hopf algebra. We say
that a Hopf monoid is strongly linearized if it has a ""basis"" preserved by its
product and coproduct in a certain sense. We prove several equivalent
characterizations of this property, and show that any strongly linearized Hopf
monoid which is commutative and cocommutative possesses four bases which one
can view as analogues of the classical bases of the algebra of symmetric
functions. There are natural functors which turn Hopf monoids into graded Hopf
algebras, and applying these functors to strongly linearized Hopf monoids
produces several notable families of Hopf algebras. For example, in this way we
give a simple unified construction of the Hopf algebras of superclass functions

oscillations in combination with results from theoretical models is a tool to
indirectly infer physical parameters in the solar atmospheric plasma. Existing
seismology schemes based on approximations to the period and damping time of
kink oscillations are often used beyond their theoretical range of
applicability. These approximations assume that the variation of density across
the loop is confined to a nonuniform layer much thinner than the radius of the
loop, but the results of the inversion problem often do not satisfy this
preliminary hypothesis. Here, we determine the accuracy of the analytic
approximations to the period and damping time, and its impact on seismology
estimates, when largely nonuniform loops are considered. We find that the
accuracy of the approximations when used beyond their range of applicability is
strongly affected by the form of the density profile across the loop, that is
observationally unknown and so must be arbitrarily imposed as part of the
theoretical model. The error associated with the analytic approximations can be
larger than 50% even for relatively thin nonuniform layers. This error directly
affects the accuracy of approximate seismology estimates compared to actual
numerical inversions. In addition, assuming different density profiles can
produce noncoincident intervals of the seismic variables in inversions of the
same event. The ignorance about the true shape of density variation across the
loop is an important source of error that may dispute the reliability of
parameters seismically inferred assuming an ad hoc density profile.

to fully characterise spiral galaxies across all morphological types. We use a
semi-analytic hierarchical model of galaxy evolution to build the theoretical
TF relation. With this tool, we analyse a unique dataset of galaxies for which
we cross-match luminosity with total circular velocity and central velocity
dispersion. We provide a theoretical framework to calculate such measurable
quantities from semi-analytic models. We establish the morphology dependence of
the TF relation in both model and data. We analyse the dynamical properties of
the model galaxies and determine that the parameter 'sigma/Vc', i.e. the ratio
between random and total motions defined by velocity dispersion and circular
velocity, accurately characterises the varying slope of the TF relation for
different model galaxy types. We apply these dynamical cuts to the observed
galaxies and find that such selection produces a differential slope of the TF
relation. The TF slope in different ranges of 'sigma/Vc' is consistent with
that for the photometric classification in Sa, Sb, Sc. We conclude that
'sigma/Vc' is a good parameter to classify galaxy type, and we argue that such
classification based on dynamics more closely mirrors the physical properties
of the observed galaxies, compared to visual classification. We also argue that
dynamical classification is useful for samples where eye inspection is not
reliable or impractical. We conclude that 'sigma/Vc' is a suitable parameter to
characterise the hierarchical assembly history that determines the
disk-to-bulge ratio, and to expand the TF relation into a three-dimensional
manifold, defined by luminosity, circular velocity and 'sigma/Vc'.

generally that which is appropriate for accurate approximation of the
conceptually smooth functions that were not actually observed. Existing
literature shows that this approach is effective, and even optimal, when using
functional data methods for prediction or hypothesis testing. However, in the
present paper we show that this approach is not effective in classification
problems. There a useful rule of thumb is that undersmoothing is often
desirable, but there are several surprising qualifications to that approach.
First, the effect of smoothing the training data can be more significant than
that of smoothing the new data set to be classified; second, undersmoothing is
not always the right approach, and in fact in some cases using a relatively
large bandwidth can be more effective; and third, these perverse results are
the consequence of very unusual properties of error rates, expressed as
functions of smoothing parameters. For example, the orders of magnitude of
optimal smoothing parameter choices depend on the signs and sizes of terms in
an expansion of error rate, and those signs and sizes can vary dramatically
from one setting to another, even for the same classifier.

outskirts of galaxy clusters. When gravity is modified, this is typically
accompanied by the introduction of an additional scalar degree of freedom,
which mediates an attractive fifth force. The presence of an extra
gravitational coupling, however, is tightly constrained by local measurements.
In chameleon modifications of gravity, local tests can be evaded by employing a
screening mechanism that suppresses the fifth force in dense environments.
While the chameleon field may be screened in the interior of the cluster, its
outer region can still be affected by the extra force, introducing a deviation
between the hydrostatic and lensing mass of the cluster. Thus, the chameleon
modification can be tested by combining the gas and lensing measurements of the
cluster. We demonstrate the operability of our method with the Coma cluster,
for which both a lensing measurement and gas observations from the X-ray
surface brightness, the X-ray temperature, and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect
are available. Using the joint observational data set, we perform a Markov
chain Monte Carlo analysis of the parameter space describing the different
profiles in both the Newtonian and chameleon scenarios. We report competitive
constraints on the chameleon field amplitude and its coupling strength to
matter. In the case of f(R) gravity, corresponding to a specific choice of the
coupling, we find an upper bound on the background field amplitude of
|f_{R0}|<6*10^{-5}, which is currently the tightest constraint on cosmological

fractions. We develop a complementary set theory for characterizing optimal QC
designs that are highly fractionated in the sense of accommodating a large
number of factors. This is in contrast to existing theoretical results which
work only for a relatively small number of factors. While the use of imaginary

show that there exists a set of particular velocities for non-radiating fluxon

results in phenomenon of quantization of fluxon velocities: in our numerical
experiments a travelling kink-like excitation radiates energy and slows down to
one of these particular velocities, taking a shape of predicted 2-pi-kink. This

the toroid is thick enough. In the chiral state the director field displays a
double twist, whereas in the achiral state there is only bend deformation. The
critical thickness increases as the difference between the twist and
saddle-splay moduli grows. A positive saddle-splay modulus prefers alignment
along the short circle of the bounding torus, and hence stimulates promotes a

transition of the mean-field Ising model. The role of the magnetisation in the
Ising model is played by the degree of twist. The role of the temperature is
played by the aspect ratio of the torus. Remarkably, an external field does not
break the chiral symmetry explicitly, but shifts the transition. In the case of

representation of the environment at each time step of the game. The basis of
the representation is a 2-D grid of cells. Each cell has a state and a set of
rules which determine whether or not that cell will dominate (i.e. pass its
state value onto) adjacent cells at each update. Once a certain number of
update iterations have been completed, the CA represents the state of the
environment in the game, the goals and the dangers. At this point, Ms. Pac-Man
will decide her next move based only on her adjacent cells, that is to say, she
has no knowledge of the state of the environment as a whole, she will simply
follow the strongest path. This technique shows promise and allows the
controller to achieve high scores in a live game, the behaviour it exhibits is
interesting and complex. Moreover, this behaviour is produced by using very
simple rules which are applied many times to each cell in the grid. Simple
local interactions with complex global results are truly achieved.

Given $n$ objects and a pairwise similarity measure, the goal is to cluster the
objects so that, to the best possible extent, similar objects are put in the
same cluster and dissimilar objects are put in different clusters. Despite its
theoretical appeal, the practical relevance of correlation clustering still
remains largely unexplored, mainly due to the fact that correlation clustering
requires the $\Theta(n^2)$ pairwise similarities as input.
  In this paper we initiate the investigation into \emph{local} algorithms for
correlation clustering. In \emph{local correlation clustering} we are given the
identifier of a single object and we want to return the cluster to which it
belongs in some globally consistent near-optimal clustering, using a small
number of similarity queries. Local algorithms for correlation clustering open
the door to \emph{sublinear-time} algorithms, which are particularly useful
when the similarity between items is costly to compute, as it is often the case
in many practical application domains. They also imply $(i)$ distributed and
streaming clustering algorithms, $(ii)$ constant-time estimators and testers
for cluster edit distance, and $(iii)$ property-preserving parallel
reconstruction algorithms for clusterability.
  Specifically, we devise a local clustering algorithm attaining a $(3,
\varepsilon)$-approximation in time $O(1/\varepsilon^2)$ independently of the
dataset size. An explicit approximate clustering for all objects can be
produced in time $O(n/\varepsilon)$ (which is provably optimal). We also
provide a fully additive $(1,\varepsilon)$-approximation with local query
complexity $poly(1/\varepsilon)$ and time complexity $2^{poly(1/\varepsilon)}$.
The latter yields the fastest polynomial-time approximation scheme for
correlation clustering known to date.

construction for regenerating codes between the minimum storage regenerating
(MSR) and the minimum bandwidth regenerating (MBR) points is given. To the best
of author's knowledge, no previous construction of exact-regenerating codes
between MBR and MSR points is done except in the work by Tian et al. On
contrast to their work, the methods used here are elementary.
  In this paper it is shown that in the case that the parameters $n$, $k$, and
$d$ are close to each other, the given construction is close to optimal when
comparing to the known functional repair capacity. This is done by showing that
when the distances of the parameters $n$, $k$, and $d$ are fixed but the actual
values approach to infinity, the fraction of the performance of constructed
codes with exact repair and the known capacity of codes with functional repair,
approaches to one. Also a simple variation of the constructed codes with almost
the same performance is given.

Its
implication remains unclear. We propose to investigate the underlying
mechanisms of this relation by considering the corresponding kinetic and
dynamic mechanisms separately. In this way, one can tell how much the kinetic
or dynamic mechanism contributes to the index of the relationship. Our analysis
gives rise to several conclusions. (1) The index of the kinetic effect in the
$L_p - E_p$ relation can simply be derived from the theory of special
relativity, which is generally larger than 2, depending on the situation
concerned. (2) The index of the dynamic effect in the relation can be deduced
from observation once a model of jets is adopted. According to current GRB
data, we find: the dynamic effect alone tends to make an anti-correlation
between $L_p$ and $E_p$; in terms of statistics, the dynamic effect is
obviously smaller than the kinetic effect; in the situation of jets with moving
discrete radio clouds which moves directly towards the observer, the index of
the dynamic effect is currently constrained within $(-1.6, -1)$, while in other
situations of jets, the constrains are different; both internal and external
shocks can account for the current data.

out using using second order Crank-Nicolson. The present scheme shows good
dispersion relation preserving property and has been thoroughly investigated
for stability. The discrete Fourier analysis shows that the method is
unconditionally stable. The fact that the method has been particularly
developed for parabolic equations with mixed derivatives makes it suitable for
solving incompressible Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations in irregular domains. To
verify the proposed method, several problems with exact and benchmark solutions
has been investigated. The proposed compact discretization has been extended to
tackle flows of varying complexities governed by the two-dimensional unsteady

exhibit behavior that is locally (i.e., in the neighborhood of any given quench

that rate, and that are quite different from the naive prediction based on the

suggests that the HEA is a matrix element effect: it arises due to a
suppression of the intensity of the broadened quasi-particle band in a narrow

the HEA appears when the matrix element is suppressed deliberately by changing
the light polarization. Calculations of the matrix element using atomic wave

reflections before exiting the star. If mechanical energy is deposited in the

probably minutes to hours for a realistic magnetic field geometry, at odds with
observed rise times of $\lap 10$ ms for both and giant flares. Mechanisms for
both small and giant flares that rely on the sudden relaxation of the magnetic
field of the core are rendered unviable by the impedance mismatch, requiring
the energy that drives these events to be stored in the magnetosphere just

far-IR by the Herschel Space Observatory around $\zeta^2$ Ret. In contrast with
previously reported systems, the disk is significantly eccentric, and the
system is Gyr-old. We aim to investigate the long-term evolution of eccentric
structures in debris disks caused by a perturber on an eccentric orbit. Both
analytical predictions and numerical N-body simulations are used to investigate
the observable structures that could be produced by eccentric perturbers. The
long-term evolution of the disk geometry is examined, with particular
application to the $\zeta^2$ Ret system. In addition, synthetic images of the
disk are produced for comparison with Herschel observations. We show that an
eccentric companion can produce both the observed offsets and eccentric disks.
Such effects are not immediate and we characterise the timescale required for
the disk to develop to an eccentric state. For the case of $\zeta^2$ Ret, we
place limits on the mass and orbit of the companion required to produce the
observations. Synthetic images show that the pattern observed around $\zeta^2$
Ret can be produced by an eccentric disk seen close to edge-on, and allow us to
bring additional constraints on the disk parameters of our model (disk flux,
extent). We determine that eccentric planets or stellar companions can induce
long-lived eccentric structures in debris disks. Observations of such eccentric
structures provide potential evidence of the presence of such a companion in a
planetary system. We consider the example of $\zeta^2$ Ret, whose observed
eccentric disk can be explained by a distant companion at tens of AU, on an

advanced numerical simulations it becomes more and more obvious that the plain
SFA misses interesting effects even on a qualitative level. Examples are
holographic side lobes, the low-energy structure, radial patterns in
photoelectron spectra at low kinetic energies, and strongly rotated angular
distributions. For this reason increasing effort has been recently devoted to
Coulomb corrections of the SFA. In the current paper, we follow a similar line
but consider ionization of metal clusters. It is known that photoelectrons from
clusters can be much more energetic than those emitted from atoms or small
molecules, especially if the Mie resonance of the expanding cluster is evoked.

cross-correlation between galaxy surveys and the CMB lensing signal to measure
galaxy bias on very large scales, where local-type primordial non-Gaussianity
predicts a $k^2$ divergence. We use the CMB lensing map recently published by
the Planck collaboration, and measure its external correlations with a suite of
six galaxy catalogues spanning a broad redshift range. We then consistently
combine correlation functions to extend the recent analysis by Giannantonio et
al. (2013), where the density-density and the density-CMB temperature
correlations were used. Due to the intrinsic noise of the Planck lensing map,
which affects the largest scales most severely, we find that the constraints on
the galaxy bias are similar to the constraints from density-CMB temperature
correlations. Including lensing constraints only improves the previous
statistical measurement errors marginally, and we obtain $ f_{\mathrm{NL}} = 12
\pm 21 $ (1$\sigma$) from the combined data set. However, the lensing
measurements serve as an excellent test of systematic errors: we now have three
methods to measure the large-scale, scale-dependent bias from a galaxy survey:
auto-correlation, and cross-correlation with both CMB temperature and lensing.
As the publicly available Planck lensing maps have had their largest-scale
modes at multipoles $l<10$ removed, which are the most sensitive to the
scale-dependent bias, we consider mock CMB lensing data covering all
multipoles. We find that, while the effect of $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ indeed
increases significantly on the largest scales, so do the contributions of both
cosmic variance and the intrinsic lensing noise, so that the improvement is
small.

exoplanets and get some clues about their atmospheric composition. However, the
chemical compositions derived from observations are not fully understood, as
for instance in the case of the CH4/CO abundance ratio, which is often inferred
different from what has been predicted by chemical models. Recently, the warm
Neptune GJ3470b has been discovered and because of its close distance from us
and high transit depth, it is a very promising candidate for follow up
characterisation of its atmosphere. We study the atmospheric composition of
GJ3470b in order to compare with the current observations of this planet, to
prepare the future ones, but also as a typical case study to understand the
chemical composition of warm (sub-)Neptunes. The metallicity of such
atmospheres is totally uncertain, and vary probably to values up to 100x solar.
We explore the space of unknown parameters to predict the range of possible
atmospheric compositions. Within the parameter space explored we find that in
most cases methane is the major carbon-bearing species. We however find that in
some cases, typically for high metallicities with a sufficiently high
temperature the CH4/CO abundance ratio can become lower than unity, as
suggested by some multiwavelength photometric observations of other warm
(sub-)Neptunes, such as GJ1214b and GJ436b. As for the emission spectrum of
GJ3470b, brightness temperatures at infrared wavelengths may vary between 400
and 800K depending on the thermal profile and metallicity. Combined with a hot
temperature profile, a substantial enrichment in heavy elements by a factor of
100 with respect to the solar composition can shift the carbon balance in
favour of carbon monoxide at the expense of CH4. Nevertheless, current
observations of this planet do not allow yet to determine which model is more
accurate.

asymmetric-energy $e^+e^-$ collider, we present three recent measurements of
time-dependent CP violation in $B$ decays, and a measurement of branching
fraction of the $B^0\to\rho^0\rho^0$ decay. We studied $B\to\omega K$ decays
and measured the values of CP violation parameters in $B^0\to\omega K^0_S$ to
be $A_{\omega K^0_S} =-0.36\pm 0.19(stat)\pm 0.05(syst)$ and $S_{\omega K^0_S}=
+0.91\pm 0.32 \pm 0.05 $, which gives the first evidence of CP violation in
this decay. In addition, we measured the direct CP violation in $B^+\to\omega
K^+$ to be $A_{CP} (B^+ \to \omega K^+)=-0.03\pm 0.04 \pm 0.01$, and two
branching fractions $B(B^0 \to \omega K^0)=(4.5\pm 0.4\pm 0.3) \times 10^{-6}$
and $B(B^+ \to \omega K^+)=(6.8\pm 0.4 \pm 0.4) \times 10^{-6}$ (preliminary).
From the measurement of CP violation parameters in the $B^0\to\eta'K^0$ decay
we obtain $S_{\eta'K^0} = 0.68 \pm 0.07\pm 0.03$ and $A_{\eta'K^0} = +0.03 \pm
0.05\pm 0.04$ (preliminary), which are the world's most precise values to date.
Measuring CP violating parameters in the $B^0\to\pi^+\pi^-$ decay gives
$A_{\pi^+\pi^-} = +0.33\pm 0.06\pm 0.03$ and $S_{\pi^+\pi^-} = -0.64\pm 0.08\pm
0.03$. This result is used in an isospin analysis to constrain the $\phi_2$
angle of the unitarity triangle, with which we rule out the region $23.8^\circ
< \phi_2 < 66.8^\circ$ at the $1\sigma$ confidence level. The measured
branching fraction of the $B^0\to\rho^0\rho^0$ decay is $B(B^0\to\rho^0\rho^0)
= (1.02\pm 0.30\pm 0.15)\times 10^{-6}$, with the fraction of longitudinally
polarized $\rho^0$ mesons being $f_L = 0.21^{+0.18}_{-0.22}\pm 0.13$. We obtain
also the first evidence of the $B^0\to f_0\rho^0$ decay, by measuring $B(B^0\to
f_0 \rho^0)\times B(f_0\to \pi^+\pi^-) = (0.86\pm 0.27 \pm 0.14)\times
10^{-6}$.

electrodynamics - was discovered by Hendrik Casimir in Eindhoven in 1948. It
predicts that two uncharged metal plates experience an attractive force because
of the zero-point fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. The idea was
tested experimentally in the 1950's and 1960's, but the results were not so
accurate that one could make a definite conclusion regarding the existence of
the effect. Evgeny Lifshitz expanded the theory in 1955 so as to deal with
general dielectric media. Much experimental work has later been done to test
the theory's predictions, especially with regards to the temperature dependence
of the effect. The existence of the effect itself was verified beyond doubt by
Sabisky and Anderson in 1973. Another quarter century had to pass before
Lamoreaux and collaborators were able to confirm - or at least make plausible -
the temperature dependence predicted by Lifshitz formula in combination with

and therefore the oscillations in the two outgoing currents must cancel each
other, yielding the anti-phase behavior, independent of the length of the

asymmetry between the channels, and for a relatively long coupling distance,
all except two of the waves in the coupled channels become evanescent. For the
remaining running waves one has a very weak dependence of the ratio between the

to converge uniformly in the strong $L^p$-sense with precise convergence rates
given. The abstract results are then applied to several concrete examples.
Further, weak convergence rates of the scheme are examined for the case of
additive noise. To analyze the weak error for the nonlinear case, techniques
based on the Malliavin calculus were usually exploited in the literature. Under
certain appropriate assumptions on the nonlinearity, this paper provides a weak
error analysis, which does not rely on the Malliavin calculus. The rates of
weak convergence can, as expected, be improved in comparison with the strong
rates. Both strong and weak convergence results obtained here show that the
proposed method achieves higher convergence rates than the implicit Euler and
Crank-Nicolson time discretizations. Numerical results are finally reported to

invariance of the DMD algorithm to left and right unitary transformations. When
data and modes are sparse in some transform basis, we show a similar invariance
of DMD to measurement matrices that satisfy the so-called restricted isometry

known, is larger than used in previous discussions of these two parameters and
we employ the same sample to explore all pairs of correlations. Further, within
this galaxy sample we investigate the scatter in each quantity, with emphasis
on the range of published values for sigma_e and effective radius (R_e). We
find that these two quantities in particular are difficult to measure
consistently and caution that precise intercomparison of galaxy properties
involving R_e and sigma_e is particularly difficult.
  Using both chi^2 and Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) fitting techniques, we
show that quoted observational uncertainties for all parameters are too small
to represent the true scatter in the data. We find that the correlation between
M_dyn and N_GC is stronger than either the M_BH-sigma_e or M_BH-N_GC relations.
We suggest that this is because both the galaxy bulge population ans N_GC were
fundamentally established at an early epoch during the same series of
star-forming events. By contrast, although the seed for M_BH was likely formed
at a similar epoch, its growth over time is less similar from galaxy to galaxy

the growth of structure on the largest scales within a simulation box will be
inhibited by the finite size of the simulation volume. Following ideas set
forth in Seto (1999), this paper shows that standard (a.k.a. 1-loop)
cosmological perturbation theory (SPT) can be used to predict, in an
approximate way, the deleterious effect of the box scale on the power spectrum
of density fluctuations in simulation volumes. Alternatively, this approach can
be used to quickly estimate post facto the effect of the box scale on power
spectrum results from existing simulations. In this way SPT can help determine
whether larger box sizes or other more-sophisticated methods are needed to
achieve a particular level of precision for a given application (e.g.
simulations to measure the non-linear evolution of baryon acoustic
oscillations). I focus on SPT in this note and show that its predictions differ
only by about a factor of two or less from the measured suppression inferred
from both powerlaw and $\Lambda$CDM $N$-body simulations. It should be possible
to improve the accuracy of these predictions through using more-sophisticated
perturbation theory models. An appendix compares power spectrum measurements
from the powerlaw simulations at outputs where box-scale effects are minimal to
perturbation theory models and previously-published fitting functions. These
power spectrum measurements are included with this paper to aid efforts to

  feedback in high-z galaxies","18 pages, 3 tables, 8 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stt2461",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the role of feedback from supernovae and black holes in the
evolution of the star formation rate function (SFRF) of z~4-7 galaxies. We use
a new set of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, ANGUS (AustraliaN GADGET-3
early Universe Simulations), run with a modified and improved version of the
parallel TreePM-smoothed particle hydrodynamics code GADGET-3 called
P-GADGET3(XXL), that includes a self-consistent implementation of stellar
evolution and metal enrichment. In our simulations both Supernova (SN) driven
galactic winds and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) act simultaneously in a complex
interplay. The SFRF is insensitive to feedback prescription at z>5, meaning
that it cannot be used to discriminate between feedback models during
reionisation. However, the SFRF is sensitive to the details of feedback
prescription at lower redshift. By exploring different SN driven wind
velocities and regimes for the AGN feedback, we find that the key factor for
reproducing the observed SFRFs is a combination of ""strong"" SN winds and early
AGN feedback in low mass galaxies. Conversely, we show that the choice of
initial mass function and inclusion of metal cooling have less impact on the
evolution of the SFRF. When variable winds are considered, we find that a
non-aggressive wind scaling is needed to reproduce the SFRFs at z>4. Otherwise,
the amount of objects with low SFRs is greatly suppressed and at the same time
winds are not effective enough in the most massive systems.

cluster Abell 3744. It hosts two prominent radio galaxies with powers in the
range critical for radio-mode feedback. The radio emission from these galaxies
terminates in buoyant tendrils reaching the cluster's outer edge, and the
radio-emitting plasma clearly influences the cluster's X-ray-emitting
atmosphere. The cluster's average gas temperature, of kT=3.5 keV, is high for
its bolometric luminosity of 3.2 \times 10^{43} ergs s^{-1}, but the 100
kpc-scale cavity carved out by radio-emitting plasma shows evidence of less
than 2 per cent of the excess enthalpy. We suggest instead that a high-velocity
encounter with a galaxy group is responsible for dispersing and increasing the
entropy of the gas in this non-cool-core cluster. We see no evidence for
shocks, or established isobaric gas motions (sloshing), but there is much
sub-structure associated with a dynamically active central region that
encompasses the brightest radio emission. Gas heating is evident in directions
perpendicular to the inferred line of encounter between the infalling group and
cluster. The radio-emitting tendrils run along boundaries between gas of
different temperature, apparently lubricating the gas flows and inhibiting heat
transfer. The first stages of the encounter may have helped trigger the radio
galaxies into their current phase of activity, where we see X-rays from the
nuclei, jets, and hotspots.

magnon excitations in the Mott phase of the single-band Hubbard model and the
remnants of these excitations with hole or electron doping. At short times, the
character of magnetic and charge excitations is maintained even for large
doping away from the Mott and antiferromagnetic phases. Doping influences both
the real-space patterns and long timescales of these excitations with a clear
carrier asymmetry attributable to particle-hole symmetry breaking in the
underlying model. Further, a rapidly-oscillating charge density wave-like
pattern weakens, but persists as a visible demonstration of a sub-leading
instability at half-filling which remains upon doping. The results offer an
approach to analyzing the behavior of systems where momentum-space is either
inaccessible or poorly defined.

assemble the problems that concern one of the most distinctive features of
modern cosmology---the interaction in the Dark Sector. The evolution of any
broadly applied model is accompanied by multiple generalizations that aim to
resolve conceptual difficulties and to explain the ever-growing pool of
observational data. In the case of Standard Cosmological Model one of the most
promising directions of generalization is replacement of the cosmological
constant with a more complicated, dynamic, form of dark energy and
incorporation of interaction between the dark components---dark energy (DE) and
dark matter (DM). Typically, DE models are based on scalar fields minimally
coupled to gravity, and do not implement explicit coupling of the field to the
background DM. However, there is no fundamental reason for this assumption in
the absence of an underlying symmetry which would suppress the coupling. Given
that we do not know the true nature of either DE or DM, we cannot exclude the
possibility that there is some kind of coupling between them. Whereas
interactions between DE and normal matter particles are heavily constrained by
observations (e.g. in the solar system and gravitational experiments on Earth),
this is not the case for DM particles. In other words, it is possible for the
dark components to interact with each other while not being coupled to standard
model particles. Therefore, the possibility of DE-DM interaction should be
investigated with utmost gravity.

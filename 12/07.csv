therefore extend the current statistical kinetic analysis to study collective

similarities with the phenomenon of ``tidal friction'' (well-known from
Newtonian gravity) operating in binary systems of viscous material bodies. In
this paper we revisit the superradiance-tidal friction analogy within the
context of ultracompact relativistic bodies. We advocate that as long as these
bodies have non-zero viscosity they should undergo tidal friction that can be
construed as a kind of superradiant scattering from the point of view of the
dynamics of an orbiting test-body. In addition we consider the presence of
anisotropic matter, which is required for at least some ultracompact bodies, if
they are to sustain a radius very close to the gravitational radius. We find
that the tidal friction/superradiance output is enhanced with increasing
anisotropy and that strongly anisotropic systems exhibit an unconventional
response to tidal and centrifugal forces. Finally, we make contact with the
artificial system comprising a black hole with its horizon replaced by a mirror
(sometimes used as a proxy for ultracompact material bodies) and discuss
superradiance and tidal friction in relation to it.

that the waves are trapped in a 2D waveguide formed by the entire arcade of

the resonant oscillations of just the visible bundle of field lines. Within the
framework of our 2D model, the two types of oscillations that have been
observationally identified, flare-induced waves and ""decayless"" oscillations,
can both be attributed to MHD fast waves. The two components of the signal
differ only because of the duration and spatial extent of the source that
creates them. The flare-induced waves are generated by strong localized sources
of short duration, while the decayless background can be excited by a
continuous, stochastic source. Further, the oscillatory signal arising from a
localized, short-duration source can be interpreted as a pattern of
interference fringes produced by waves that have traveled diverse routes of
various pathlengths through the waveguide. The resulting amplitude of the
fringes slowly decays in time with an inverse square root dependence. The
details of the interference pattern depend on the shape of the arcade and the
spatial variation of the Alfv\'en speed. The rapid decay of this wave
component, which has previously been attributed to physical damping mechanisms
that remove energy from resonant oscillations, occurs as a natural consequence
of the interference process without the need for local dissipation.

by their helicity, a very remarkable property which is related to the
time-reversal symmetry and the topology of the underlying system. We
theoretically investigate a Hong-Ou-Mandel like setup as a tool to probe it.
Collisions of two electrons with the same spin show a Pauli dip, analogous to
the one obtained in the integer quantum Hall case. Moreover, the collisions
between electrons of opposite spin also lead to a dip, known as
$\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ dip, which is a direct consequence of the constraints imposed
by time-reversal symmetry. In contrast to the integer quantum Hall case, the
visibility of these dips is reduced by the presence of the additional edge
channels, and crucially depends on the properties of the quantum point contact.
As a unique feature of this system, we show the possibility of three-electron
interference, which leads to a total suppression of the noise independently of
the point contact configuration. This is assured by the peculiar interplay
between Fermi statistics and topology. This work intends to extend the domain
of applicability of electron quantum optics.

functional theory has been shown to have striking features. For example, step
and peak features are generically found when the system is far from its
ground-state, and these depend nonlocally on the density in space and time. We
analyze the xc potential by decomposing it into kinetic and interaction
potential components, and comparing each with their exact-adiabatic
counterparts, for a range of dynamical situations in model one-dimensional (1D)
two-electron systems. We find that often, but not always, the kinetic contri-

adiabatic approximation. The adiabatic approximation often makes a smaller
error for the potential contribution, which we write in two parts, one being
the Coulomb potential due to the time-dependent xc hole. These observations
also held in non-equilibrium cases we studied where there are large features in
the correlation po- tential although no step structure. In ground-state
situations, step and peak structures arise in cases of static correlation, when
more than one determinant is essential to describe the interacting state. We
investigate the time-dependent natural orbital occupation numbers and find the
corresponding relation between these and the dynamical step is more complex

production and decay at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) within the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). We find that the scenario with light
coloured sfermions -- stops or sbottoms -- has the potential to explain a
non-universal alteration, as hinted by LHC data, of the gluon-gluon Fusion
($\mu_{ggF}$) with respect to the Vector Boson Fusion ($\mu_{VBF}$) event rates
and, in particular, can predict $\frac{\mu_{VBF}}{\mu_{ggF}}>1$ for all Higgs
boson decay channels in large areas of the parameter space.
  We also find that the scenario with a light stop/sbottom can be complemented
by the scenario in which the total Higgs width, $\Gamma_{\rm tot}$, is reduced
due to a suppressed Yukawa coupling $Y_b$. In this case, the reduction of the
Higgs production rates in the $ggF$ process which occurs in the maximal mixing
scenario is compensated by the reduction of the $H\to b\bar{b}$ partial decay
width, the largest component of $\Gamma_{\rm tot}$.
  Furthermore, we highlight the fact that, in the light stop/sbottom scenario,
event rates with the Higgs boson decaying to a $b\bar{b}$ final state are
predicted to be essentially below unity. Therefore, during the future LHC runs,
the measurement of $h\to b\bar{b}$ final states is a matter of special
importance.
  Amongst all viable MSSM configurations that we study (including revisiting a
light stau solution), we emphasise most the scenario with a light stop, as the
latter is also motivated by Dark Matter and Electro-Weak baryogenesis. We also
perform fits of the MSSM against the LHC data, emphasising the fact that in
most cases these are better than for the SM.

circumvents the complicated structure of the Boltzmann-Einstein system of

is extended here to include, on a phenomenological basis, an out-of-equilibrium
interaction between radiation and baryons which is supposed to account for
relevant aspects of pre-recombination physics in a simplified manner.
Furthermore, we use the tight-coupling approximation to explore the influence

altitudes around close-in extrasolar giant planets (EGPs) such as HD209458b
imply that these planets have hot and rapidly escaping atmospheres that extend
to several planetary radii. These characteristics, however, cannot be
generalized to all close-in EGPs. The thermal escape mechanism and mass loss
rate from EGPs depend on a complex interplay between photochemistry and
radiative transfer driven by the stellar UV radiation. In this work we explore
how these processes change under different levels of irradiation on giant
planets with different characteristics. We confirm that there are two distinct
regimes of thermal escape from EGPs, and that the transition between these
regimes is relatively sharp. Our results have implications on thermal mass loss
rates from different EGPs that we discuss in the context of currently known
planets and the detectability of their upper atmospheres.

orbiting component. Results: The companion is resolved by PIONIER at a
projected separation $\rho = 29.2 \pm 0.2$ mas and projection angle $PA = 167.6

pulsation phase for the Cepheid $\phi = 0.24$ and 0.48. The lower contrast at

allocation, where the primary rationing mechanism is through waiting times.
Specifically we consider allocating medical treatments to a population of
patients. Each patient needs exactly one treatment, and can choose from $k$
hospitals. Hospitals have different costs, which are fully paid by a third
party ---the ""payer"". The payer has a fixed budget $B$, and each hospital will
have its own waiting time. At equilibrium, each patient will choose his most
preferred hospital given his intrinsic preferences and the waiting times. The
payer thus computes the waiting times so that at equilibrium the budget
constraint is satisfied and the social welfare is maximized.
  We first show that the optimization problem is NP-hard, yet if the budget can
be relaxed to $(1+\epsilon)B$ for an arbitrarily small $\epsilon$, then the
optimum under budget $B$ can be approximated efficiently. Next, we study the
endogenous emergence of waiting time from the dynamics between hospitals and
patients, and show that there is no need for the payer to explicitly enforce
the optimal waiting times. Under certain conditions, all he need is to enforce
the amount of money he wants to pay to each hospital. The dynamics will always
converge to the desired waiting times in finite time.
  We then go beyond equilibrium solutions and investigate the optimization
problem over a much larger class of mechanisms containing the equilibrium ones
as special cases. With two hospitals, we show that under a natural assumption
on the patients' preference profiles, optimal welfare is in fact attained by
the randomized assignment mechanism, which allocates patients to hospitals at
random subject to the budget constraint, but avoids waiting times.
  Finally, we discuss potential policy implications of our results, as well as
follow-up directions and open problems.

uplink interference in a two-tier network considering multi-type users and base

independent homogeneous Poisson point processes, and tier-2 users are modeled
as locally non-homogeneous clustered Poisson point processes centered at tier-2

we quantify the interference at both tiers. Our model is also able to capture
the impact of two types of exclusion regions, where either tier-2 base stations
or tier-2 users are restricted in order to avoid cross-tier interference. As an
important application of this analytical model, an intensity planning scenario
is investigated, in which we aim to maximize the total income of the network
operator with respect to the intensities of tier-2 cells, under constraints on
the outage probabilities of tier-1 and tier-2 users. The result of our
interference analysis suggests that this maximization can be converted to a
standard convex optimization problem. Finally, numerical studies further
demonstrate the correctness of our analysis.

Korteweg--de Vries equation and many other more or less classical models, are
known to admit rich families of periodic travelling waves. The stability theory
for these waves is still in its infancy though. The issue has been tackled by
various means. Of course, it is always possible to address stability from the
spectral point of view. However, the link with nonlinear stability -in fact,
\emph{orbital} stability, since we are dealing with space-invariant problems-,
is far from being straightforward when the best spectral stability we can
expect is a \emph{neutral} one. Indeed, because of the Hamiltonian structure,
the spectrum of the linearized equations cannot be bounded away from the
imaginary axis, even if we manage to deal with the point zero, which is always
present because of space invariance. Some other means make a crucial use of the
underlying structure. This is clearly the case for the variational approach,
which basically uses the Hamiltonian -or more precisely, a constrained
functional associated with the Hamiltonian and with other conserved quantities-
as a Lyapunov function. When it works, it is very powerful, since it gives a
straight path to orbital stability. An alternative is the modulational
approach, following the ideas developed by Whitham almost fifty years ago. The
main purpose here is to point out a few results, for KdV-like equations and
systems, that make the connection between these three approaches: spectral,
variational, and modulational.

to be maximal (given the values of the neutrino mixing angles) and
experimentally observable. We present also predictions for the sum of the
neutrino masses, for the Majorana CPV phases and for the effective Majorana
mass in neutrinoless double beta decay. The predictions of the model can be
tested in a variety of ongoing and future planned neutrino experiments.

magnetic lanthanide atoms and even molecules. For molecules, it has been
speculated that a dense forest of resonances in ultracold collision cross

observed energy spectra of nuclear scattering do. According to the
Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit conjecture, these fluctuations would imply chaotic
dynamics of the underlying classical motion driving the collision. This would
provide a paradigm shift in ultracold atomic and molecular physics,
necessitating new ways of looking at the fundamental interactions of atoms in
this regime, as well as perhaps new chaos-driven states of ultracold matter. In
this report we provide the first experimental demonstration that random spectra
are indeed found at ultralow temperatures. In the experiment, an ultracold gas
of erbium atoms is shown to exhibit many Fano-Feshbach resonances, for bosons
on the order of 3 per gauss. Analysis of their statistics verifies that their
distribution of nearest-neighbor spacings is what one would expect from random
matrix theory. The density and statistics of these resonances are explained by
fully-quantum mechanical scattering calculations that locate their origin in
the anisotropy of the atoms' potential energy surface. Our results therefore

process (DPP) generated by any chaotic trajectory of the flow repeatedly
crossing a canonical surface-of-section (herein referred to as a sigma-type
DPP). This paper introduces the idea of using stochastic point process models
to describe and understand the spatial statistical features of sigma-type DPPs
in two-degree-of-freedom (2D) Hamiltonian systems. In the specific context of
2D non-integrable systems possessing ergodic components, it is proposed that,
in an ergodic region, the pertinent model for describing the spatial
statistical features of any typical sigma-type DPP is the two-dimensional
homogeneous Poisson point process (herein denoted by P2). Of particular
interest in this paper are the (Euclidean) kth-nearest-neighbor distance
characteristics (k=1,2,3,...) of a given sigma-type DPP. Employing the
two-dimensional cardioid and semi-circular mushroom billiards as generic test
cases, it is shown that typical sample sigma-type DPPs possess
kth-nearest-neighbor distance characteristics consistent with model predictions
for P2. Deviations from this observed Poissonian behavior are expected in
strictly non-ergodic regions (i.e., the chaotic regions in generic Hamiltonian
systems), but in cases where the dynamics is strongly (but not fully) chaotic,
such deviations are posited to be negligible. The validity of the latter claim
is demonstrated in the case of the 2D Henon-Heiles system at the critical
energy. The results of the numerical experiments are contextualized and their
significances to both classical and quantum chaos are discussed.

present best-fit models in which either the ADAF or the jet dominate the X-ray

truncated disk with transition radii 30-225 Rs in four of them. In almost all
sources the optical emission can also be attributed to unresolved, old stellar
clusters with masses ~1E7-1E8 Msun. We find evidence for a correlation between
the accretion rate and jet power and an anti-correlation between the
radio-loudness and the accretion rate. We confirm previous findings that the
radio emission is severely underpredicted by ADAF models and explained by the
relativistic jet. We find evidence for a nonlinear relation between the X-ray

gaugino masses, generated through anomalies at 1-loop, remain relatively light
O(1) TeV. In models with scalar mass universality, input scalar masses are
generally very heavy (m_0 \simeq m_{3/2}) resulting in a mass spectrum
resembling that in split supersymmetry. However, if one adopts a no-scale or
partial no-scale structure for the K\""ahler manifold, sfermion masses may
vanish at the tree level. It is usually assumed that the leading order anomaly
mediated contribution to scalar masses appears at 2-loops. However, there are
at least two possible sources for 1-loop scalar masses. These may arise if
Pauli-Villars fields are introduced as messengers of supersymmetry breaking. We
consider the consequences of a spectrum in which the scalar masses associated
with the third generation are heavy (order m_{3/2}) with 1-loop scalar masses
for the first two generations. A similar spectrum is expected to arise in GUT
models based on E_7/SO(10) where the first two generations of scalars act as
pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons. Explicit breaking of this symmetry by the gauge
couplings then generates one-loop masses for the first two generations. In
particular, we show that it may be possible to reconcile the g_mu - 2
discrepancy with potentially observable scalars and gauginos at the LHC.

property that the ``position'' of every element of the space is uniquely
determined by the distances from the elements of the generators. Specifically
we introduce a generator based on a partition of the metric space into sets of
elements. The sets of the partition will work as the new elements which will
uniquely determine the position of each single element of the space. A set $W$
of vertices of a connected graph $G$ strongly resolves two different vertices
$x,y\notin W$ if either $d_G(x,W)=d_G(x,y)+d_G(y,W)$ or
$d_G(y,W)=d_G(y,x)+d_G(x,W)$, where $d_G(x,W)=\min\left\{d(x,w)\;:\;w\in
W\right\}$. An ordered vertex partition $\Pi=\left\{U_1,U_2,...,U_k\right\}$ of
a graph $G$ is a strong resolving partition for $G$ if every two different
vertices of $G$ belonging to the same set of the partition are strongly
resolved by some set of $\Pi$. A strong resolving partition of minimum
cardinality is called a strong partition basis and its cardinality the strong
partition dimension. In this article we introduce the concepts of strong
resolving partition and strong partition dimension and we begin with the study
of its mathematical properties. We give some realizability results for this
parameter and we also obtain tight bounds and closed formulae for the strong
metric dimension of several graphs.

Schwarzschild or Kerr), the required assumptions are much weaker than the ones

guidance of the wave function. In de Broglie's original formulation, the
particle dynamics is given by a first-order differential equation. In Bohm's
reformulation, it is given by Newton's law of motion with an extra potential
that depends on the wave function--the quantum potential--together with a
constraint on the possible velocities. It was recently argued, mainly by
numerical simulations, that relaxing this velocity constraint leads to a
physically untenable theory. We provide further evidence for this by showing
that for various wave functions the particles tend to escape the wave packet.
In particular, we show that for a central classical potential and bound energy
eigenstates the particle motion is often unbounded. This work seems
particularly relevant for ways of simulating wave function evolution based on
Bohm's formulation of the de Broglie-Bohm theory. Namely, the simulations may
become unstable due to deviations from the velocity constraint.

usual connectivity links within each network and the dependency links coupling
nodes of different networks. Due to the latter links such networks are known to
suffer from cascading failures and catastrophic breakdowns. When modeling these
phenomena, usually one assumes that a fraction of nodes gets damaged in one of
the networks, which is followed possibly by a cascade of failures. In real life
the initiating failures do not occur at once and effort is made replace the
ties eliminated due to the failing nodes. Here we study a dynamic extension of
the model of interdependent networks and introduce the possibility of link
formation with a probability w, called healing, to bridge non-functioning nodes
and enhance network resilience. A single random node is removed, which may
initiate an avalanche. After each removal step healing sets in resulting in a
new topology. Then a new node fails and the process continues until the giant
component disappears either in a catastrophic breakdown or in a smooth
transition. Simulation results are presented for square lattices as starting
networks under random attacks of constant intensity. We find that the shift in
the position of the breakdown has a power-law scaling as a function of the
healing probability with an exponent close to 1. Below a critical healing
probability, catastrophic cascades form and the average degree of surviving
nodes decreases monotonically, while above this value there are no macroscopic
cascades and the average degree has first an increasing character and decreases
only at the very late stage of the process. These findings facilitate to plan
intervention in case of crisis situation by describing the efficiency of
healing efforts needed to suppress cascading failures.

significantly from the double exponential shape predicted by the effective

for currents below this threshold are a monotonic function of the current.
However, the thermally-induced switching model breaks down for currents

hydrated respectively with heavy water (D2O) to capture the protein dynamics,
and with light water (H2O), to probe the dynamics of the hydration shell, in
the temperature range from 210 $<$ T $<$ 260 K. The hydration fraction in both
cases was about $\sim$ 0.38 gram of water per gram of dry protein. The field
strengths investigated were respectively 0 kV/mm and 2 kV/mm (2 10$^6$ V/m) for
the protein hydrated with D2O and 0 kV and 1 kV/mm for the H2O hydrated
counterpart. While the overall internal protons dynamics of the protein appears
to be unaffected by the application of electric field up to 2 kV/mm, likely due
to the stronger intra-molecular interactions, there is also no appreciable
quantitative enhancement of the diffusive dynamics of the hydration water, as
would be anticipated based on our recent observations in water confined in
silica pores under field values of 2.5 kV/mm. This may be due to the difference
in surface interactions between water and the two adsorption hosts (silica and
protein), or to the existence of a critical threshold field value Ec $\sim$ 2-3
kV/mm for increased molecular diffusion, for which electrical breakdown is a
limitation for our sample.

the Adiabatic-then-Wigner (AW) QCL approach does not. Moreover, the Wigner

nontrivial GP of adiabatic electronic states in the presence of a conical

the number of photons in the N00N state, often leading to the conclusion that
N00N states are unsuitable for spatial measurements. Here, we create spatial
super-resolution fringes with two-, three-, and four-photon N00N states, and
demonstrate a scalable implementation of the so-called ``optical centroid
measurement'' which provides an in-principle perfect detection efficiency.
Moreover, we compare the N00N-state interference to the corresponding classical
super-resolution interference. Although both provide the same increase in
spatial frequency, the visibility of the classical fringes decreases
exponentially with the number of detected photons, while the visibility of our
experimentally measured N00N-state super-resolution fringes remains
approximately constant with N. Our implementation of the optical centroid

computation which is based on encoding, protecting and manipulating quantum
information in a quantum harmonic oscillator. This proposal exploits
multi-photon driven dissipative processes to encode quantum information in
logical bases composed of Schr\""odinger cat states. More precisely, we consider
two schemes. In a first scheme, a two-photon driven dissipative process is used
to stabilize a logical qubit basis of two-component Schr\""odinger cat states.
While such a scheme ensures a protection of the logical qubit against the
photon dephasing errors, the prominent error channel of single-photon loss
induces bit-flip type errors that cannot be corrected. Therefore, we consider a
second scheme based on a four-photon driven dissipative process which leads to
the choice of four-component Schr\""odinger cat states as the logical qubit.
Such a logical qubit can be protected against single-photon loss by continuous
photon number parity measurements. Next, applying some specific Hamiltonians,
we provide a set of universal quantum gates on the encoded qubits of each of
the two schemes. In particular, we illustrate how these operations can be
rendered fault-tolerant with respect to various decoherence channels of
participating quantum systems. Finally, we also propose experimental schemes
based on quantum superconducting circuits and inspired by methods used in
Josephson parametric amplification, which should allow to achieve these driven

multi-particle Eisenhart lift of the original problem, that reduces to the
standard Eisenhart lift. Such generalised Eisenhart lift acts as an inverse
Kaluza-Klein reduction, promoting coupling constants to momenta in higher
dimension. In particular, isometries of the generalised lift metric correspond
to energy preserving transformations that mix coordinates and coupling
constants. A by-product of the analysis is that the lift of the Toda Lax pair
can be used to construct higher rank Killing tensors for both the standard and
generalised lift metrics.

information about atmospheric pressures. By comparing the absorption strengths
of rotational and vibrational features to the absorption strengths of dimer
features, we show that in some cases it may be possible to estimate the

using the O2 A band and the 1.06 $\mu$m dimer feature, either in transmission

atmospheric pressures between 0.1 and 10 bars, and for O2 volume mixing ratios
above 50% of Earth's present day level. Furthermore, unlike observations of
Rayleigh scattering, this method can be used at wavelengths longer than 0.6
$\mu$m, and is therefore potentially applicable, although challenging, to
near-term planet characterization missions such as JWST. We have also performed
detectability studies for JWST transit transmission spectroscopy and find that
the 1.06 $\mu$m and 1.27 $\mu$m dimer features could be detectable (SNR$>$3)

of these features could provide a constraint on the atmospheric pressure of an

multiple nuclei sources, we compared the estimated AGN luminosities with
supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses inferred from large aperture K-band
stellar emission photometry in individual nuclei. We found that mass accretion
rates onto SMBHs are significantly different among multiple SMBHs, such that
larger-mass SMBHs generally show higher mass accretion rates when normalized to
SMBH mass. Our results suggest that non-synchronous mass accretion onto SMBHs
in gas- and dust-rich infrared luminous merging galaxies hampers the
observational detection of kiloparsec-scale multiple active SMBHs. This could
explain the significantly smaller detection fraction of kiloparsec-scale dual
AGNs when compared with the number expected from simple theoretical

dominated by local conditions, rather than by global galaxy properties,
reinforcing the importance of observations to our understanding of how multiple

mean-squared error is used as an optimization criterion in a partially
observable Markov decision process formulation. A stochastic dynamic
programming algorithm is proposed to solve for the optimal solution. To enhance
the quality of system state estimates, approximate MMSE smoothing estimators
are also derived. Finally, the performance of the proposed framework is
illustrated on the problem of physical activity detection in wireless body
sensing networks. The power of the proposed framework lies within its ability
to accommodate a broad spectrum of active classification applications including
sensor management for object classification and tracking, estimation of sparse
signals and radar scheduling.

obstacles for using such systems in frequency-division duplex mode, namely the
high overhead for the feedback of channel state information (CSI) to the

of this algorithm in some realistic propagation channels that take into account
the partial overlap of the angular spectra from different users, as well as the
sparsity of mm-Wave channels. We formulate the problem of user grouping for two
different objectives, namely maximizing spatial multiplexing, and maximizing
total received power, in a graph-theoretic framework. As the resulting problems
are numerically difficult, we proposed (sub optimum) greedy algorithms as
efficient solution methods. Numerical examples show that the different
algorithms may be superior in different settings.We furthermore develop a new,
""degenerate"" version of JSDM that only requires average CSI at the transmitter,
and thus greatly reduces the computational burden. Evaluations in propagation
channels obtained from ray tracing results, as well as in measured outdoor
channels show that this low-complexity version performs surprisingly well in

determined by its dynamicity in monitoring but also in its flexibility in
utilizing the available power in each of its nodes. In this paper we propose a
hybrid intrusion detection system, based on a power level metric for potential
adhoc hosts, which is used to determine the duration for which a particular
node can support a network monitoring node. Power aware hybrid intrusion
detection system focuses on the available power level in each of the nodes and
determines the network monitors. Power awareness in the network results in
maintaining power for network monitoring, with monitors changing often, since
it is an iterative power optimal solution to identify nodes for distributed
agent based intrusion detection. The advantage that this approach entails is
the inherent flexibility it provides, by means of considering only fewer nodes
for reestablishing network monitors. The detection of intrusions in the network
is done with the help of Cellular Automat CA. The CAs classify a packet routed
through the network either as normal or an intrusion. The use of CAs enable in
the identification of already occurred intrusions as well as new intrusions.

21.84 hours exhibits a distinctly asymmetric transit profile, likely indicative
of the emission of dusty effluents, and reminiscent of KIC 1255b. The host star
has $T_{\rm eff}$ = 4435 K, M = 0.63 $M_\odot$, and R = 0.57 $R_\odot$,
comparable to the parameters ascribed to KIC 12557548. The transit egress can
be followed for ~25% of the orbital period, and, if interpreted as extinction
from a dusty comet-like tail, indicates a long lifetime for the dust grains of
more than a day. We present a semi-physical model for the dust tail
attenuation, and fit for the physical parameters contained in that expression.
The transit is not sufficiently deep to allow for a study of the
transit-to-transit variations, as is the case for KIC 1255b; however, it is
clear that the transit depth is slowly monotonically decreasing by a factor of
~2 over the duration of the Kepler mission. The existence of a second star
hosting a planet with a dusty comet-like tail would help to show that such
objects may be more common and less exotic than originally thought. According
to current models, only quite small planets with Mp < 0.03 $M_\oplus$ are
likely to release a detectable quantity of dust. Thus, any ""normal-looking""
transit that is inferred to arise from a rocky planet of radius greater than
~1/2 $R_\oplus$ should not exhibit any hint of a dusty tail. Conversely, if one
detects an asymmetric transit, due to a dusty tail, then it will be very
difficult to detect the hard body of the planet within the transit because, by
necessity, the planet must be quite small (i.e., < 0.3 $R_\oplus$).

$\R^2$ for the two-component Gierer-Meinhardt (GM) and Schnakenburg
reaction-diffusion models is analyzed in the semi-strong interaction limit
corresponding to an asymptotically small diffusion coefficient $\eps^2$ of the
activator concentration. In the limit $\eps\to 0$, localized spots in the
activator are centered at the lattice points of a Bravais lattice with constant
area $|\Omega|$. To leading order in $\nu={-1/\log\eps}$, the linearization of
the steady-state periodic spot pattern has a zero eigenvalue when the inhibitor
diffusivity satisfies $D={D_0/\nu}$, for some $D_0$ independent of the lattice
and the Bloch wavevector $\kb$. From a combination of the method of matched
asymptotic expansions, Floquet-Bloch theory, and the rigorous study of certain
nonlocal eigenvalue problems, an explicit analytical formula for the continuous
band of spectrum that lies within an ${\mathcal O}(\nu)$ neighborhood of the
origin in the spectral plane is derived when $D={D_0/\nu} + D_1$, where
$D_1={\mathcal O}(1)$ is a de-tuning parameter. The periodic pattern is
linearly stable when $D_1$ is chosen small enough so that this continuous band
is in the stable left-half plane $\mbox{Re}(\lambda)<0$ for all $\kb$.
Moreover, for both the Schnakenburg and GM models, our analysis identifies a
model-dependent objective function, involving the regular part of the Bloch
Green's function, that must be maximized in order to determine the specific
periodic arrangement of localized spots that constitutes a linearly stable
steady-state pattern for the largest value of $D$. From a numerical
computation, it is shown within the class of oblique Bravais lattices that a
regular hexagonal lattice arrangement of spots is optimal for maximizing the
stability threshold in $D$.

pre-existing infrastructures. Due to the nodal mobility, supporting QoS during
routing in this type of networks is a very challenging task. To tackle this
type of overhead many routing algorithms with clustering approach have been
proposed. Clustering is an effective method for resource management regarding
network performance, routing protocol design, QoS etc. Most of the flat network
architecture contains homogeneous capacity of nodes but in real time nodes are
with heterogeneous capacity and transmission power. Hierarchical routing
provides routing through this kind of heterogeneous nodes. Here, routes can be
recorded hierarchically, across clusters to increase routing flexibility.
Besides this, it increases scalability and robustness of routes. In this paper,
a novel ant based QoS aware routing is proposed on a three level hierarchical
cluster based topology in MANET which will be more scalable and efficient
compared to flat architecture and will give better throughput.

interested in the case where the goal is to answer similarity queries about the
compressed sequence, i.e. to identify whether or not the original sequence is
similar to a given query sequence. We study the fundamental tradeoff between
the compression rate and the reliability of the queries performed on compressed
data. For i.i.d. sequences, we characterize the minimal compression rate that
allows query answers, that are reliable in the sense of having a vanishing
false-positive probability, when false negatives are not allowed. The result is
partially based on a previous work by Ahlswede et al., and the inherently
typical subset lemma plays a key role in the converse proof. We then
characterize the compression rate achievable by schemes that use lossy source
codes as a building block, and show that such schemes are, in general,
suboptimal. Finally, we tackle the problem of evaluating the minimal
compression rate, by converting the problem to a sequence of convex programs

Several works have been conducted on ERP systems, most of them focusing on the
development of new algorithms for the automatic discovery of business
processes. We focused on addressing issues like, how can organizations with ERP
systems apply process mining for analyzing their business processes in order to
improve them. The data handling aspect of ERP systems contrasts with those of
BPMS or workflow based systems, whose systematical storage of events
facilitates the application of process mining techniques. CRISP-DM has emerged
as the de facto standard for developing data mining and knowledge discovery
projects. Successful data mining requires three families of analytical
capabilities namely reporting, classification and forecasting. A data miner
uses more than one analytical method to get the best results. The objective of
this paper is to improve the usability and understandability of process mining
techniques, by implementing CRISP-DM methodology for their application in ERP
contexts, detailed in terms of specific implementation tools and step by step
coordination. Our study confirms that data discovery from ERP system improves

with advanced LIGO and Virgo observatories are anticipated in the next five
years. These detections could pave the way for multi-messenger
gravitational-wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) astronomy if GW triggers are
successfully followed up with targeted EM observations. However, GW sky
localization is relatively poor, with expected localization areas of ~10--100
square degrees; this presents a challenge for following up GW signals from
compact binary mergers. Prioritizing wide-field follow-ups based on the
probability of successful imaging is important when it is impossible to tile
the entire gravitational-wave localization region.
  Galaxy catalogs were effective at narrowing down regions of the sky to search
in initial attempts at joint GW/EM observations. The next generation of GW
detectors will have a ten-fold increase in range thereby increasing the
expected number of galaxies per unit solid angle a thousand-fold. As an
additional complication, catalogs may be highly incomplete.
  We show how to quantify the advantages of using galaxy catalogs as a function
of only two parameters: the three-dimensional volume within the field of view
of a telescope after accounting for the GW distance measurement uncertainty,
and the fraction of the GW sky localization uncertainty region that can be
followed up. We find that the use of galaxy catalogs can improve success rates
by ~10% to a factor of 4 relative to follow-up strategies that do not utilize
such catalogs for the scenarios we considered. We determine that catalogs with
a 75% completeness perform comparably to complete catalogs in most cases, while
33%-complete catalogs can lead to lower follow-up success rates than complete
catalogs for small fields of view, though still providing an advantage over
strategies that do not use a catalog at all.

highly ionized metal absorption lines. However, it is unclear whether such
lines are produced by the hot interstellar medium (ISM) or the circumstellar
medium (CSM) intrinsic to the binaries. Here we present a Chandra X-ray
absorption line study of 28 observations on 12 X-ray binaries, with a focus on
the NeIX and FeXVII lines. We report the first detections of these lines in a
significant amount of observations. We do not find significant dependence of
the line equivalent width on the distance of the XRBs, but we do see weak
dependence on the source X-ray luminosity. We also find two out of twelve
selected targets show strong temporal variation of the NeIX absorbers. While
the line ratio between the two ion species suggests a temperature consistent
with the previous predictions of the ISM, comparing with two theoretical models
of the ISM shows the observed column densities are significantly higher than
predictions. On the other hand, photoionzation by the XRBs provides reasonably
good fit to the data. Our findings suggest that a significant fraction of these
X-ray absorbers may originate in the hot gas intrinsic to the X-ray binaries,
and that the ISM makes small, if not negligible, contribution. We briefly
discuss the implications to the study of the Milky Way hot gas content.

steering the space-variant PBP which creates a spin-dependent geometric phase

gauge-fixing in the presence of soft breaking of the BRST symmetry in the
field-antifield formalism is developed. It is based on a gauged (involving a
field-dependent parameter) version of finite BRST transformations. The
prescription allows one to restore the gauge-independence of the effective
action at its extremals and therefore also that of the conventional $S$-matrix
for a theory with BRST-breaking terms being additively introduced into a
BRST-invariant action in order to achieve a consistency of the functional
integral. We demonstrate the applicability of this prescription within the
approach of functional renormalization group to the Yang--Mills and gravity
theories. The Gribov--Zwanziger action and the refined Gribov--Zwanziger action
for a many-parameter family of gauges, including the Coulomb, axial and
covariant gauges, are derived perturbatively on the basis of finite gauged BRST
transformations starting from Landau gauge. It is proved that gauge theories
with soft breaking of BRST symmetry can be made consistent if the transformed
BRST-breaking terms satisfy the same soft BRST symmetry breaking condition in
the resulting gauge as the untransformed ones in the initial gauge, and also
without this requirement.

cosmological parameters ($\Omega_{\rm m} h^2, \Omega_{\rm b} h^2, n_s, w,

spectrum for $z\leq2$ at sub-per cent accuracy for modes up to

N-body simulations, yet provides a worst-case error $<1$ per cent fit to the

overall precision of PkANN is set by the accuracy of our N-body simulations, at
5 per cent level for cosmological models with $\sum m_\nu<0.5$ eV for all
redshifts $z\leq2$. For models with $\sum m_\nu>0.5$ eV, predictions are
expected to be at 5 (10) per cent level for redshifts $z>1$ ($z\leq1$). The

employing a Cluster-based Classification (CCM) technique. Traditionally,
stylometric features have been successfully employed in various authorship
analysis tasks; we extend the traditional feature-set to include some more
interesting and effective features for email authorship identification (e.g.
the last punctuation mark used in an email, the tendency of an author to use
capitalization at the start of an email, or the punctuation after a greeting or
farewell). We also included Info Gain feature selection based content features.
It is observed that the use of such features in the authorship identification
process has a positive impact on the accuracy of the authorship identification
task. We performed experiments to justify our arguments and compared the
results with other base line models. Experimental results reveal that the
proposed CCM-based email authorship identification model, along with the
proposed feature set, outperforms the state-of-the-art support vector machine
(SVM)-based models, as well as the models proposed by Iqbal et al. [1, 2]. The
proposed model attains an accuracy rate of 94% for 10 authors, 89% for 25
authors, and 81% for 50 authors, respectively on Enron dataset, while 89.5%
accuracy has been achieved on authors' constructed real email dataset. The
results on Enron dataset have been achieved on quite a large number of authors
as compared to the models proposed by Iqbal et al. [1, 2].

the result shows that any short interval [x, x + y], y => C(log x)^(1+e),

magnetic compass, were recently shown to be biological open quantum systems. We
here show that the coupling of the radical-pair's spin degrees of freedom to
its decohering vibrational reservoir leads to a shift of the radical-pair's
magnetic energy levels. The Lamb shift Hamiltonian is diagonal in the
singlet-triplet basis, and results in a singlet-triplet energy splitting
physically indistinguishable from an exchange interaction. This could have
significant implications for understanding the energy level structure and the
dynamics of photosynthetic reaction centers.

unlicensed secondary users to opportunistically access a licensed band. The
ability to detect the presence of a primary user at a low signal to noise ratio
(SNR) is a challenging prerequisite to spectrum sensing and earlier proposed
techniques like energy detection and cyclostationary detection have only been
partially successful. This paper proposes the use of FRESH (FREquency SHift)
filters [1] to enable spectrum sensing at low SNR by optimally estimating a
cyclostationary signal using its spectral coherence properties. We establish
the mean square error convergence of the adaptive FRESH filter through
simulation. Subsequently, we formulate a cyclostationarity based binary
hypothesis test on the filtered signal and observe the resultant detection
performance. Simulation results show that the proposed approach performs better
than energy detection and cyclostationary detection techniques for spectrum
sensing.

  mechanics)","15 pages, LATEX",,,,"physics.gen-ph physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  I propose to treat the biological evolution of genoms by means of quantum
mechanical tools. We start with the concept of meta- gene, which specifies the
""selfish gene"" of R.Dawkins. Meta- gene encodes the abstract living unity,
which can live relatively independently of the others, and can contain a few
real creatures. Each population of living creatures we treat as the wave
function on meta- genes, which module squared is the total number of creatures
with the given meta-gene, and the phase is the sum of ""aspirations"" to change
the classical states of meta- genes. Each individual life thus becomes one of
possible outcomes of the virtual quantum measurement of this function. The
evolution of genomes is described by the unitary operator in the space of
psi-functions or by Kossovsky-Lindblad equation in the case of open biosystems.
This operator contains all the information about specific conditions under
which individuals are, and how ""aspirations"" of their meta- genes may be
implemented at the biochemical level. We show the example of quantum
description of the population with two parts of meta-gene: ""wolves"" and ""deer"",
which can be simultaneously in the same abstract living unity. ""Selfish gene""
reconciled with the notion of individuality of alive beings that gives
possibility to consider evolutionary scenarios and their possible physical
causes from the single position.

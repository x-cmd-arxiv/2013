film transistors (TFTs) are fabricated using densely aligned arrays of metallic
CNTs (m-CNTs) as source and drain electrodes, and aligned arrays of
semiconducting enriched CNTs (s-CNTs) as channel material. The electrical
transport measurements at room temperature show that the m-CNT contacted s-CNT
array devices with a 2 um channel length perform superiorly to those of control
Pd contacted s-CNT devices. The m-CNT contacted devices exhibit a maximum
(average) on-conductance of 36.5 uS (19.2 uS), transconductance of 2.6 uS (1.2
uS), mobility of 51 cm2/Vs (25 cm2/Vs), and current on-off ratio of 1.1x10E6
(2.5x10E5). These values are almost an order of magnitude higher than that of
control Pd contacted devices with the same channel length and s-CNT linear
density. The low temperature charge transport measurements suggest that these
improved performances are due to the lower charge injection barrier of
m-CNT/s-CNT array devices compared to Pd/s-CNT array devices. We attribute the
lower injection barrier to unique geometry of our devices. In addition to using
semiconducting enriched CNT, our results suggest that using metallic CNT as an
electrode can significantly enhance the performance of CNT TFTs.

efficiency is obtained when the dephasing timescale matches the hopping
timescale, which represent new examples of the Goldilocks principle at the

optimal levels of environmental fluctuations, the average effect of increasing

(ii) It exploits unlabeled sample data for bootstrapping effective activity
recognizers, i.e., substantially reduces the amount of ground truth annotation
required for model estimation. Such unlabeled data is trivial to obtain, e.g.,
through contemporary smartphones carried by users as they go about their
everyday activities.
  Based on the self-taught learning paradigm we automatically derive an
over-complete set of basis vectors from unlabeled data that captures inherent
patterns present within activity data. Through projecting raw sensor data onto
the feature space defined by such over-complete sets of basis vectors effective
feature extraction is pursued. Given these learned feature representations,
classification backends are then trained using small amounts of labeled

of the recognition tasks and sensor modalities. Primarily we focus on
transportation mode analysis task, a popular task in mobile-phone based
sensing. The sparse-coding framework significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art in supervised learning approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate
the great practical potential of the new approach by successfully evaluating
its generalization capabilities across both domain and sensor modalities by
considering the popular Opportunity dataset. Our feature learning approach
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches to analyzing activities in daily

solving constrained problems. Tree-search algorithms like backtracking try to
construct a solution to a CSP by selecting the variables of the problem one
after another. The order in which these algorithm select the variables
potentially have significant impact on the search performance. Various
heuristics have been proposed for choosing good variable ordering. Many
powerful variable ordering heuristics weigh the constraints first and then
utilize the weights for selecting good order of the variables. Constraint
weighting are basically employed to identify global bottlenecks in a CSP.
  In this paper, we propose a new approach for learning weights for the
constraints using competitive coevolutionary Genetic Algorithm (GA). Weights
learned by the coevolutionary GA later help to make better choices for the
first few variables in a search. In the competitive coevolutionary GA,
constraints and candidate solutions for a CSP evolve together through an
inverse fitness interaction process. We have conducted experiments on several
random, quasi-random and patterned instances to measure the efficiency of the
proposed approach. The results and analysis show that the proposed approach is
good at learning weights to distinguish the hard constraints for quasi-random
instances and forced satisfiable random instances generated with the Model RB.
For other type of instances, RNDI still seems to be the best approach as our
experiments show.

at least, results from the interaction between (differential) rotation,
convection, and magnetic field. The Kepler mission has been collecting data for
a large number of stars during 4 years allowing us to investigate magnetic
stellar cycles. We investigated the Kepler light curves to look for magnetic
activity or even hints of magnetic activity cycles. Based on the photometric
data we also looked for new magnetic indexes to characterise the magnetic
activity of the stars. We selected a sample of 22 solar-like F stars that have
a rotation period smaller than 12 days. We performed a time-frequency analysis
using the Morlet wavelet yielding a magnetic proxy. We computed the magnetic
index S_ph as the standard deviation of the whole time series and the index
<S_ph> that is the mean of standard deviations measured in subseries of length
five times the rotation period of the star. We defined new indicators to take
into account the fact that complete magnetic cycles are not observed for all
the stars, such as the contrast between high and low activity. We also inferred
the Rossby number of the stars and studied their stellar background. This
analysis shows different types of behaviours in the 22 F stars. Two stars show
behaviours very similar to magnetic activity cycles. Five stars show long-lived
spots or active regions suggesting the existence of active longitudes. Two
stars of our sample seem to have a decreasing or increasing trend in the
temporal variation of the magnetic proxies. Finally the last group of stars
show magnetic activity (with presence of spots) but no sign of cycle.

classical particle systems with periodic boundary conditions is addressed. It
is shown that conventional theory based on Noether's theorem fails to explain
the simplest possible example, notably jumps of angular momentum in the case of
single particle moving in a periodic cell. It is suggested to consider the
periodic cell as an open system, exchanging mass, momentum, angular momentum,
and energy with surrounding cells. Then the behavior of the cell is described
by balance laws rather than conservation laws. It is shown using the law of
angular momentum balance that the variation of the angular momentum in systems
with periodic boundary conditions is a consequence of (i) the non-zero flux of
angular momentum through the boundaries and (ii) torque acting on the cell due
to the interactions between particles in the cell with images in the
neighboring cells. Two simple examples demonstrating both phenomena are
presented.

various deterministic local rules. Initial spreading with exponential
quality-dependent time scales is followed by a stationary state with a
prevalence depending on the quality of the contagion. We also observe various
interesting phenomena, for example, high prevalence without the participation
of the hubs. This is in sharp contrast with the general belief that hubs play a
central role in a typical spreading process. We further study the role of
network topology in various models and find that as long as small-world effect
exists, the underlying topology does not contribute to the final stationary
state but only affects the initial spreading velocity.

Bitcoin white-paper, states that the security of the system is guaranteed as

based on theoretically flawed assumptions.
  In the paper we analyze two kinds of attacks based on two theoretical flaws:
the Block Discarding Attack and the Difficulty Raising Attack. We argue that
the current theoretical limit of attacker's fraction of total computational
power essential for the security of the system is in a sense not $\frac{1}{2}$
but a bit less than $\frac{1}{4}$, and outline proposals for protocol change
that can raise this limit to be as close to $\frac{1}{2}$ as we want.

2010, and lately was independently though-of and analyzed by both author of
this paper and authors of a most recently pre-print published paper. We thus
focus on the major differences of our analysis, and try to explain the
unfortunate surprising coincidence. To the best of our knowledge, the second

Arbitrary

Numerical anomalies in designs such as the single node connections and

of the shape functions and their derivatives for the numerical evaluation of

three-dimensional elasticity state equation using a Virtual Element Method
(VEM) approach. The main characteristic difference between VEM and standard
finite element methods (FEM) is that in VEM the canonical basis functions are
not constructed explicitly. Rather the stiffness matrix is computed directly
utilizing a projection map which extracts the linear component of the
deformation. Such a construction guarantees the satisfaction of the patch test
(used by engineers as an indicator of optimal convergence of numerical
solutions under mesh refinement). Finally, the computations reduce to the
evaluation of matrices which contain purely geometric surface facet quantities.

the problem of complex-shaped classes of curves, where each class is composed

each class of curves via a mixture model formulation, and the regime changes
within each sub-class through a hidden logistic process. The approach allows
therefore for fitting flexible curve-models to each class of complex-shaped
curves presenting regime changes through an unsupervised learning scheme, to
automatically summarize it into a finite number of homogeneous clusters, each
of them is decomposed into several regimes. The model parameters are learned by
maximizing the observed-data log-likelihood for each class by using a dedicated

Gaussian mixture models, to the case of curve clustering by regression
mixtures, including polynomial regression mixtures as well as spline or

initialization and the one of choosing the optimal number of clusters as the EM
learning proceeds, rather than in a two-fold scheme. This is achieved by
optimizing a penalized log-likelihood criterion. A simulation study confirms

Galactic Ridge X-ray emission (GRXE) arising from the scattering of the
radiation of bright X-ray binaries (XBs) by the interstellar medium (ISM). The
morphology of this scattered component is expected to trace the clumpy
molecular and HI clouds. We calculate this contribution to the GRXE from known
Galactic XBs assuming that they are all persistent. The known XBs sample is
incomplete, however, because it is flux limited and spans the lifetime of X-ray
astronomy ($\sim 50$ years). We therefore also use a simulated sample of
sources, to estimate the diffuse emission we should expect in an optimistic
case assuming that the X-ray luminosity of our Galaxy is on average similar to
that of other galaxies. In the calculations we also take into account the
enhancement of the total scattering cross-section due to coherence effects in
the elastic scattering from multi-electron atoms and molecules. This scattered
emission can be distinguished from the contribution of low X-ray luminosity
stars by the presence of narrow fluorescent K-$\alpha$ lines of Fe, Si, and
other abundant elements present in the ISM and by directly resolving the
contribution of low X-ray luminosity stars. We find that within $1^\circ$
latitude of the Galactic plane the scattered emission contributes on average
$10-30\%$ of the GRXE flux in the case of known sources and over $50\%$ in the
case of simulated sources. In the latter case, the scattered component is found
to even dominate the stellar emission in certain parts of the Galactic plane.
X-rays with energies $\gtrsim 1$ keV from XBs should also penetrate deep inside
the HI and molecular clouds, where they are absorbed and heat the ISM. We find
that this heating rate dominates the heating by cosmic rays (assuming a solar
neighborhood energy density) in a considerable part of the Galaxy. [abridged]

high stiffness form and grow in the lung tissue due to collagen deposition by
fibroblast cells. We have previously shown that ongoing collagen deposition may
not lead to significant increases in the bulk modulus of the lung until these
local remodeled regions have become sufficiently numerous and extensive to
percolate in a continuous path across the entire tissue [Bates {\it et al.}
2007 {\it Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med.} {\bf 176} 617]. In the present study,
we investigate whether spatial correlations influence the bulk modulus in a
two-dimensional elastic network model of lung tissue. Random collagen
deposition at a single site is modeled by increasing the elastic constant of
the spring at that site by a factor of 100.
  By contrast, correlated collagen deposition is represented by stiffening the
springs encountered along a random walk starting from some initial spring, the
rationale being that excess collagen deposition is more likely in the vicinity
of an already stiff region. A combination of random and correlated deposition
is modeled by performing random walks of length $N$ from randomly selected
initial sites, the balance between the two processes being determined by $N$.
We found that the dependence of bulk modulus, $B(N,c)$, on both $N$ and the
fraction of stiff springs, $c$, can be described by a strikingly simple set of
empirical equations.
  Our results suggest that the spatial correlation of collagen deposition in
the fibrotic lung has a strong effect on the rate of lung function decline and
on the mechanical environment in which the cells responsible for remodeling
find themselves.

around the world. How to provide valuable recommendations to viewers is an
important task for both video websites and related third parties, such as
search engines. Previous work conducted numerous analysis on the view counts of
videos, which measure a video's value in terms of popularity. However, the
long-lasting value of an online video, namely longevity, is hidden behind the
history that a video accumulates its ""popularity"" through time. Generally
speaking, a longevous video tends to constantly draw society's attention. With
focus on one of the leading video websites, Youtube, this paper proposes a
scoring mechanism quantifying a video's longevity. Evaluating a video's
longevity can not only improve a video recommender system, but also help us to
discover videos having greater advertising value, as well as adjust a video
website's strategy of storing videos to shorten its responding time. In order
to accurately quantify longevity, we introduce the concept of latent social
impulses and how to use them measure a video's longevity. In order to derive
latent social impulses, we view the video website as a digital signal filter
and formulate the task as a convex minimization problem. The proposed longevity
computation is based on the derived social impulses. Unfortunately, the
required information to derive social impulses are not always public, which
makes a third party unable to directly evaluate every video's longevity. To
solve this problem, we formulate a semi-supervised learning task by using part
of videos having known longevity scores to predict the unknown longevity
scores. We propose a Gaussian Random Markov model with Loopy Belief Propagation
to solve this problem. The conducted experiments on Youtube demonstrate that
the proposed method significantly improves the prediction results comparing to
baselines.

  The topic of the GRAPHITE workshop is graph analysis in all its forms in
computer science. Graphs are used to represent data in many application areas,
and they are subjected to various computational algorithms in order to acquire
the desired information. These graph algorithms tend to have common
characteristics, such as duplicate detection to guarantee their termination,
independent of their application domain. Over the past few years, it has been
shown that the scalability of such algorithms can be dramatically improved by
using, e.g., external memory, by exploiting parallel architectures, such as
clusters, multi-core CPUs, and graphics processing units, and by using
heuristics to guide the search. Novel techniques to further scale graph search
algorithms, and new applications of graph search are within the scope of this
workshop.
  Another topic of interest of the event is more related to the structural
properties of graphs: which kind of graph characteristics are relevant for a
particular application area, and how can these be measured? Finally, any novel
way of using graphs for a particular application area is on topic.
  The goal of this event is to gather scientists from different communities,
such as model checking, artificial intelligence planning, game playing, and
algorithm engineering, who do research on graph search algorithms, such that
awareness of each others' work is increased.

follows the expected behavior of increased metallicity due to a larger
bandwidth for pressures up to 12.5 GPa. Surprisingly, for higher pressures when
the structure becomes unstable, the resistance starts to increase. Around 32.5
GPa at 300 K, we observe a novel pressure-induced corundum-to-monoclinic
transition between two metallic phases, showing that the structural phase
transition can be decoupled from the metal-insulator transition. Using X-ray
Raman scattering, we find that screening effects, which are strong in the

indicate that this can be related to a decrease in coherent quasiparticle

typically undergo phases of strong mass loss in the form of eruptions that can
create shells of ejecta around the star. Our goal is to search for the presence

and mostly shows forbidden lines of [FeII], with an underlying continuum that
decreases with wavelength up to ~15 um and then inverts its slope, displaying a
second peak around 60 um, evidence for cold dust grains formed in a past
eruption. By modeling the SED, we identify two central components, besides the

heat conductivity in one-dimensional chains with asymmetric nearest-neighbor
potential. We conjecture that the convergence is promoted not by the mere
asymmetry of the potential, but due to ability of the chain to dissociate. In
other terms, the attractive part of the potential function should approach a
finite value as the distance between the neighbors grows. To clarify this
point, we study the simplest model of this sort -- a chain of linearly elastic
disks with finite diameter. If the distance between the disk centers exceeds
their diameter, the disks cease to interact. Formation of gaps between the
disks is the only possible mechanism for scattering of the oscillatory waves.
Heat conduction in this system turns out to be convergent. Moreover, an
asymptotic behavior of the heat conduction coefficient for the case of large
densities and relatively low temperatures obeys simple Arrhenius-type law. In
the limit of low densities, the heat conduction coefficient converges due to
triple disk collisions. Numeric observations in both limits are grounded by
analytic arguments. In a chain with Lennard-Jones nearest-neighbor potential
the heat conductivity also saturates in a thermodynamic limit and the
coefficient also scales according to the Arrhenius law for low temperatures.
This finding points on a universal role played by the possibility of
dissociation, as convergence of the heat conduction coefficient is considered.

spin-based electronics or spintronics. This is usually achieved by contacting
ferromagnets with metals or semiconductors, in which the relaxation of spins
due to spin-orbit coupling limits both the efficiency and the length scale. In
topological insulator materials, on the contrary, the spin-orbit coupling is so
strong that the spin direction uniquely determines the current direction, which
allows us to conceive a whole new scheme for spin detection and manipulation.
Nevertheless, even the most basic process, the spin injection into a
topological insulator from a ferromagnet, has not yet been demonstrated. Here
we report successful spin injection into the surface states of topological
insulators by using a spin pumping technique. By measuring the voltage that
shows up across the samples as a result of spin pumping, we demonstrate that a
spin-electricity conversion effect takes place in the surface states of
bulk-insulating topological insulators Bi1.5Sb0.5Te1.7Se1.3 and Sn-doped
Bi2Te2Se. In this process, due to the two-dimensional nature of the surface
state, there is no spin current along the perpendicular direction. Hence, the
mechanism of this phenomenon is different from the inverse spin Hall effect and
even predicts perfect conversion between spin and electricity at room
temperature. The present results reveal a great advantage of topological
insulators as inborn spintronics devices.

is noticed when the two oscillators are locked in 1:1 synchronization. Moreover

periodic forcing, using a small ac input current in addition to that of the dc

satisfied for projective measurements; however, for generalized measurements
special conditions on the operators determining the measurements need to be
met. For the Jarzynski equality to hold, the measurement operators of the
forward protocol must be normalized in a particular way. The Crooks relation
additionally entails that the backward and forward measurement operators depend
on each other. Yet, quite some freedom is left as to how the two sets of
operators are interrelated. This ambiguity is removed if one considers
selective measurements, which are specified by a {\it joint} probability
density function of work and measurement results of the considered observable.
We find that the respective forward and backward joint probabilities satisfy
the Crooks relation only if the measurement operators of the forward and
backward protocols are the time-reversed adjoints of each other. In this case,
the work probability density function {\it conditioned} on the measurement
result satisfies a modified Crooks relation. The modification appears as a
protocol-dependent factor that can be expressed by the information gained by
the measurements during the forward and backward protocols. Finally, detailed
fluctuation theorems with an arbitrary number of intervening measurements are
obtained.

some theoretical potential vector equilibrium problem to the scalar problem

parameter of the Hamiltonian. Starting from one of the topological phases that
has an edge Majorana, the system is suddenly driven to the other topological
phase or to the (topologically) trivial phases and also to the quantum critical
points (QCPs) separating these phases. The survival probability of the initial
edge Majorana as a function of time is studied following the quench.
Interestingly when the chain is quenched to the QCP, we find a nearly perfect
oscillations of the survival probability, indicating that the Majorana travels
back and forth between two ends, with a time period that scales with the system
size. We also generalize to the situation when there is a next-nearest-neighbor
hopping in superconducting chain and there resulting in a pair of edge Majorana
at the each end of the chain in the topological phase. We show that the
frequency of oscillation of the survival probability gets doubled in this case.

modes at each end of the chain) to an another Hamiltonian which has only one

importance to both fundamental science and potential applications in
topological quantum computing1,2. Majorana fermions are predicted to exist in a
vortex core of superconducting topological insulators3. However, they are
extremely difficult to be distinguished experimentally from other quasiparticle
states for the tiny energy difference between Majorana fermions and these
states, which is beyond the energy resolution of most available techniques.
Here, we overcome the problem by systematically investigating the spatial
profile of the Majorana mode and the bound quasiparticle states within a vortex
in Bi2Te3/NbSe2. While the zero bias peak in local conductance splits right off
the vortex center in conventional superconductors, it splits off at a finite
distance ~20nm away from the vortex center in Bi2Te3/NbSe2, primarily due to
the Majorana fermion zero mode. While the Majorana mode is destroyed by
reducing the distance between vortices, the zero bias peak splits as a
conventional superconductor again. This work provides strong evidences of
Majorana fermions and also suggests a possible route to manipulating them.

lesion borders in dermoscopy images using ensembles of thresholding methods.
Experiments on a difficult set of 90 images demonstrate that the proposed
method is robust, fast, and accurate when compared to nine state-of-the-art
methods.

of algebraic methods the isomorphism is proved between such self-similarity
features and the deformed coherent state formalism.

theoretically considered. The equations of the free acoustic field are derived.
They coincide in the mathematical form with Maxwell equations for the free
electromagnetic (EM) field. It is accentuated, that the equations in the
mathematical form of Maxwell equations for the free EM-field are universal
equations of the Nature. They describe any free complex-vector physical field,
vector-functions of which are analytical functions. In the case of a free
acoustic field, it seems to be the strong indication taking into account the
quantum Fermi liquid model of EM-field leading to the existence of phonons,
accompanying the process of a photon formation, that FA-field and free EM-field
are the display of the single united field, both the components of which can
propagate simultaneously [however, with different velocities], for instance, in
weakly absorbing media. The theory proposed can be the theoretical basis for
the practical realization of superconducting states at high temperature in the
materials with the strong interaction of electrons with acoustic field phonons
and with microwave photons in magnetic resonance conditions.

Manna","Cyclic and Coherent States in Flocks with Topological Distance","15 pages, 18 figures",,,,"physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A simple model of the two dimensional collective motion of a group of mobile
agents have been studied. Like birds, these agents travel in open free space
where each of them interacts with the first $n$ neighbors determined by the
topological distance with a free boundary condition. Using the same
prescription for interactions used in the Vicsek model with scalar noise it has
been observed that the flock, in absence of the noise, arrives at a number of
interesting stationary states. In the `single sink state' the entire flock
maintains perfect cohesion and coherence. In the `cyclic state' every agent
executes a uniform circular motion, and the entire flock executes a pulsating
dynamics i.e., expands and contracts periodically between a minimum and a
maximum size of the flock. When refreshing rate of the interaction zone is the
fastest, the entire flock gets fragmented into smaller clusters of different
sizes. On introduction of scalar noise a crossover is observed when the agents
cross over from a ballistic motion to a diffusive motion. Expectedly the
crossover time is dependent on the strength of the noise $\eta$ and diverges as
$\eta \to 0$. In simpler version the translational degrees of freedom of the
agents are suppressed but their angular motion are retained. Here agents are
the spins, placed at the sites of a square lattice with periodic boundary
condition. Every spin interacts with its $n$ = 2, 3 or 4 nearest neighbors. In
the stationary state the entire spin pattern moves as a whole when interactions
are anisotropic with $n$ = 2 and 3; but it is completely frozen when the
interaction is isotropic with $n=4$. These spin configurations have
vortex-antivortex pairs whose density increases as the noise $\eta$ increases
and follows an excellent finite-size scaling analysis.

topological phase in a correlated 2D electron gas under strong magnetic field.
While electric currents propagate as chiral downstream edge modes, chargeless
upstream chiral neutral edge modes were recently observed only in
hole-conjugate states (states filling \nu, n+1/2<\nu<n+1, with n=0,1,2,...),
and in the even denominator state \nu=5/2. It is believed that spontaneous
'density reconstruction' near the edges of the 2D gas, leads to multiple
counter propagating edge channels, being separated from each other by
incompressible strips. Unavoidable disorder induces inter-channel tunneling;
accompanied by Coulomb interaction it renormalizes the multiple edge channels
to a downstream charge mode and upstream neutral edge mode(s), while
maintaining the parity requirements (e.g., the heat conductance along the edge)
dictated by the bulk. Here, we report of highly sensitive shot noise
measurements that revealed unexpected presence of neutral modes in a variety of
non-hole-conjugate fractional states. As already reported previously, we did
not observe neutral modes in any of the integer states. In addition to the
upstream neutral edge modes, we were surprised to find also neutral energy
modes that propagate through the incompressible bulk. While along the edge,
density reconstruction may account for the edge modes, we are not aware of a
model that can account for the bulk modes. The proliferation of neutral modes,
in every tested fractional state, changes drastically the accepted picture of
FQHE states: an insulating bulk and 1D chiral edge channels. The apparent
ubiquitous presence of these energy modes may account for decoherence of
fractional quasiparticles - preventing observation of coherent interference in
the fractional regime.

the administrated dose should be sufficient to eradicate the tumor and at the

given dose and schedule of ionizing radiation eradicates all the tumor cells in
a given tissue is called the tumor control probability (TCP), and is often used
to compare various treatment strategies used in radiation therapy. In this
paper, we aim to investigate the effects of including cell-cycle phase on the
TCP by analyzing a stochastic model of a tumor comprised of actively dividing
cells and quiescent cells with different radiation sensitivities. We derive an
exact phase-diagram for the steady-state TCP of the model and show that at
high, clinically-relevant doses of radiation, the distinction between active
and quiescent tumor cells (i.e. accounting for cell-cycle effects) becomes of
negligible importance in terms of its effect on the TCP curve. However, for
very low doses of radiation, these proportions become significant determinants
of the TCP. Moreover, we use a novel numerical approach based on the method of
characteristics for partial differential equations, validated by the Gillespie
algorithm, to compute the TCP as a function of time. We observe that our
results differ from the results in the literature using similar existing
models, even though similar parameters values are used, and the reasons for
this are discussed.

assume two order parameters which describe the phase transition. The first one
is the density distribution at MI boundary $\rho (\vec r)$. The second one is a
two component complex vector in spin space $\Psi (\vec r)$. It determines
electron density in metallic or semimetallic phase in the presence of external
magnetic field. Two different components of the vector describe possible spin
states of electrons inserted in the external magnetic field.
  The first order type MI phase transition determined by the variation of the
density distribution is considered by means of the gradient expansion of Cahn
and Hillard type \cite{CahnHillard}. The second order type transition of
electron density beside MI boundary is described by Ginzburg -- Landau
expansion \cite{LandLif2}. The interaction between these two parameters is
assumed to be linear as a function of electron density with a coefficient which
depends on metallic density (cf. \cite{JinwuYe_Lubensky}). The obtained
nonlinear equations are exactly solved in the case of MI boundary in the
presence of the parallel to the boundary or perpendicular to it uniform
magnetic field. The surface tension $\Sigma _{mi}$ at the MI boundary is
calculated. It is shown that $\Sigma _{mi}$ is singular. In particular, $\Sigma
_{mi}\sim n^{3/2}$ as $ n\Rightarrow 0$ and $\Sigma _{mi}\sim (T-T_c (\vec
h))^{3/2} .$ $T_c (\vec h)$ is the transition temperature in the presence of

considered. Additional stars resembling the solar UBV colors in a broad sense,

they are both less dependent on lower-level details and easier to understand
and combine. This approach goes top-down from the algorithms and shields them
from lower-level details by introducing very high level abstractions atop the
intermediate abstractions of robotics middleware. This approach is illustrated
on 7 variants of the Bug family that were implemented using both laser and
infra-red sensors.

task which is used in surgical and medical planning and assessments. If experts
do the segmentation manually with their own medical knowledge, it will be
time-consuming. Therefore, researchers propose methods and systems which can do
the segmentation automatically and without any interference. In this article,
an unsupervised automatic method for brain tumor segmentation on MRI images is
presented. In this method, at first in the pre-processing level, the extra
parts which are outside the skull and don't have any helpful information are
removed and then anisotropic diffusion filter with 8-connected neighborhood is
applied to the MRI images to remove noise. By applying the fast bounding
box(FBB) algorithm, the tumor area is displayed on the MRI image with a
bounding box and the central part is selected as sample points for training of
a One Class SVM classifier. A database is also provided by the Zanjan MRI
Center. The MRI images are related to 10 patients who have brain tumor. 100
T2-weighted MRI images are used in this study. Experimental results show the
high precision and dependability of the proposed algorithm. The results are
also highly helpful for specialists and radiologists to easily estimate the
size and position of a tumor.

singlet chiral multiplets from that in the minimal supersymmetric standard

higher-dimensional vector multiplet, this model is highly predictive.
Properties of the particles in the Higgs sector are characteristic and can be
different from those in the Standard Model and other models. We evaluate
deviations in coupling constants of the standard model-like Higgs boson and the
mass spectrum of the additional Higgs bosons. We find that our model is
discriminative from the others by precision measurements of these coupling

making a type of error that in the 1980s became infamous in crystallography. As
a result of the increased scrutiny of the issue of centrosymmetricity of the
1980's, there are now much better analysis tools to resolve the issue fully,
and its important to understand that not just our crystals are centrosymmetric,
even the old guy's crystals were centrosymmetric (and by implication everyone's
are). There is no shame in having made that error back in the day and those
authors would not find the current centrosymmetric result controversial; their
paper is excellent in all other aspects. This manuscript describes how the
structure is determined, explains the structure schematically, calculates the
electronic structure based on the correct centrosymmetric crystal structure,

requires expressing the geopotential as a Pfaffian function in certain

sophisticated mathematics are not needed if implementing both the relegation of
the nodes and the parallax elimination directly in Delaunay variables.
Proceeding analogously, it is shown here how the elimination of the perigee can
be carried out also in Delaunay variables. In this way the construction of the

of the transformation series is achieved with considerable savings, on the

about one third of the number of terms required in the classical approach.

how combination policies influence the learning process of networked agents,

Within the inflationary paradigm, the properties of the bispectrum are one of
the keys that serves to discriminate among competing scenarios concerning the
details of the origin of cosmological perturbations. However, all of the
scenarios, based on the conventional approach to the so-called
""quantum-to-classical transition"" during inflation, lack the ability to point
out the precise physical mechanism responsible for generating the inhomogeneity

reduction of the quantum state provide plausible explanations for the birth of

be quite different from those found in the traditional approach. In particular,
the statistical features corresponding to the primordial perturbations, which

graphene is currently one of the notable players in the intense drive towards
bendable, thin, and portable electronic displays, where its intrinsically
metallic, optically transparent, and mechanically robust nature are major
advantages. Given that the intrinsic transparency of a graphene monolayer is
97.7 %, any small, reproducible, controllable, and potentially reversible
modulation of transparency can have a significant impact for graphene as a
viable transparent conducting electrode. Even more so, if the degree of
modulation is polarization dependent. Here we show that the transparency in the
visible range of graphene pre-strained on a Polyethylene terephthalate (PET)
substrate exhibits a periodic modulation (0.1 %) as a function of polarization
direction, which we interpret as strain-induced optical anisotropy. The degree
of anisotropy is varied by reversible external manipulation of the level of
pre-strain. The magnitude of strain is monitored independently by optical
absorption and Raman spectroscopy, and the experimental observations are
consistent with the theoretically expected modification of the optical
conductivity of graphene arising from the strain-induced changes in the
electronic dispersion of graphene. The strain sensitivity of the optical

2012) paper, we focus on the complexity of undirected graph templates. As our
main contribution, we settle the two principal open questions proposed in (CSR
2012). Firstly, we complete the classification of clique templates by proving a
full trichotomy for all possible combinations of counting quantifiers and
clique sizes, placing each case either in P, NP-complete or Pspace-complete.
This involves resolution of the cases in which we have the single quantifier
$\exists^{\geq j}$ on the clique $K_{2j}$. Secondly, we confirm a conjecture
from (CSR 2012), which proposes a full dichotomy for $\exists$ and
$\exists^{\geq 2}$ on all finite undirected graphs. The main thrust of this
second result is the solution of the complexity for the infinite path which we
prove is a polynomial-time solvable problem. By adapting the algorithm for the
infinite path we are then able to solve the problem for finite paths, and then
trees and forests. Thus as a corollary to this work, combining with the other
cases from (CSR 2012), we obtain a full dichotomy for $\exists$ and
$\exists^{\geq 2}$ quantifiers on finite graphs, each such problem being either
in P or NP-hard. Finally, we persevere with the work of (CSR 2012) in exploring
cases in which there is dichotomy between P and Pspace-complete, in contrast
with situations in which the intermediate NP-completeness may appear.

section is about $10^{-25}-10^{-24}$ cm$^3$s$^{-1}$, orders of magnitude larger

a non-DM origin of the emission. If DM subhalos are taken into account, the

predictions a challenging task. This is best achieved through appropriately
constrained solar dynamo simulations and as such the first step towards
predictions is to understand the underlying physics of the solar dynamo
mechanism. In Babcock-Leighton type dynamo models, the poloidal field is
generated near the solar surface whereas the toroidal field is generated in the
solar interior. Therefore a finite time is necessary for the coupling of the
spatially segregated source layers of the dynamo. This time delay introduces a
memory in the dynamo mechanism which allows forecasting of future solar
activity. Here we discuss how this forecasting ability of the solar cycle is
affected by downward turbulent pumping of magnetic flux. With significant
turbulent pumping the memory of the dynamo is severely degraded and thus long

necessary prerequisite for the effective grid integration of large shares of

Photovoltaics (PV). This paper establishes the necessary framework for
quantifying and visualizing the technically available operational flexibility

defining power system operational flexibility, namely the power ramp-rate,
power and energy capability of generators, loads and storage devices, are
presented. The flexibility properties of different power system unit types,

Quantitative results and flexibility visualizations are presented for intuitive

realizing interactions involving Dirac states. By carefully preparing the
samples at a non-natural-cleavage (100) crystalline surface, we uncover many
novel electronic and spin properties in Na3Bi by utilizing high resolution
angle- and spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. We observe
two bulk 3D Dirac nodes that locate on the opposite sides of the bulk zone
center point $\Gamma$, which exhibit a Fermi surface Lifshitz transition and a
saddle point singularity. Furthermore, our data shows evidence for the possible
existence of theoretically predicted weak 2D nontrivial spin-orbit surface
state with helical spin polarization that are nestled between the two bulk
Dirac cones, consistent with the theoretically calculated (100)
surface-arc-modes. Our main experimental observation of a rich multiplet of

computational power as a way of solving problems that are otherwise
intractable. Unfortunately, getting serial algorithms to run in parallel to
take advantage of these computational resources remains a challenge for several
application domains. Many parallel algorithms can scale to only hundreds of
cores. The limiting factors of such algorithms are usually communication
overhead and poor load balancing. Solving NP-hard graph problems to optimality
using exact algorithms is an example of an area in which there has so far been
limited success in obtaining large scale parallelism. Many of these algorithms
use recursive backtracking as their core solution paradigm. In this paper, we
propose a lightweight, easy-to-use, scalable framework for transforming almost
any recursive backtracking algorithm into a parallel one. Our framework incurs
minimal communication overhead and guarantees a load-balancing strategy that is
implicit, i.e., does not require any problem-specific knowledge. The key idea
behind this framework is the use of an indexed search tree approach that is
oblivious to the problem being solved. We test our framework with parallel
implementations of algorithms for the well-known Vertex Cover and Dominating
Set problems. On sufficiently hard instances, experimental results show linear
speedups for thousands of cores, reducing running times from days to just a few
minutes.

we propose the design of a vanadium dioxide dual-mode plasmonic waveguide
electroabsorption modulator using a metal-insulator-VO$_2$-insulator-metal

modulator can route plasmonic waves through the low-loss dielectric insulator
layer during the ""on"" state and high-loss VO$_2$ layer during the ""off"" state,
thereby significantly reducing the insertion loss while maintaining a large
modulation depth. This ultracompact waveguide modulator, for example, can
achieve a large modulation depth of ~10dB with an active size of only
200x50x220nm$^3$ (or ~{\lambda}$^3$/1700), requiring a drive-voltage of ~4.6V.
This high performance plasmonic modulator could potentially be one of the keys
towards fully-integrated plasmonic nanocircuits in the next-generation chip

from the Standard Model (SM) predictions in coupling constants of the SM-like
Higgs boson ($h$). We can thus discriminate extended Higgs models by precisely
measuring the pattern of deviations in the coupling constants of $h$, even when
extra bosons are not found directly. In order to compare the theoretical
predictions to the future precision data at the ILC, we must evaluate the
theoretical predictions with radiative corrections in various extended Higgs
models. In this talk, we give our comprehensive study for radiative corrections
to various Higgs boson couplings of $h$ in the minimal Higgs triplet model
(HTM). First, we define renormalization conditions in the model, and we
calculate the Higgs coupling; $g\gamma\gamma, hWW, hZZ$ and $hhh$ at the one
loop level. We then evaluate deviations in coupling constants of the SM-like
Higgs boson from the predictions in the SM. We find that one-loop contributions
to these couplings are substantial as compared to their expected measurement
accuracies at the ILC. Therefore the HTM has a possibility to be distinguished
from the other models by comparing the pattern of deviations in the Higgs boson

  In this framework we present a rigorous analysis of the Ad hoc On-Demand
Distance Vector (AODV) protocol, a popular routing protocol designed for MANETs
and WMNs, and one of the four protocols currently standardised by the IETF
MANET working group.
  We give a complete and unambiguous specification of this protocol, thereby
formalising the RFC of AODV, the de facto standard specification, given in
English prose. In doing so, we had to make non-evident assumptions to resolve
ambiguities occurring in that specification. Our formalisation models the exact
details of the core functionality of AODV, such as route maintenance and error
handling, and only omits timing aspects.
  The process algebra allows us to formalise and (dis)prove crucial properties
of mesh network routing protocols such as loop freedom and packet delivery. We
are the first to provide a detailed proof of loop freedom of AODV. In contrast
to evaluations using simulation or model checking, our proof is generic and
holds for any possible network scenario in terms of network topology, node
mobility, etc. Due to ambiguities and contradictions the RFC specification
allows several interpretations; we show for more than 5000 of them whether they
are loop free or not, thereby demonstrating how the reasoning and proofs can
relatively easily be adapted to protocol variants.
  Using our formal and unambiguous specification, we find shortcomings of AODV
that affect performance, e.g. the establishment of non-optimal routes, and some
routes not being found at all. We formalise improvements in the same process

cross section of Standard Model fermions with gravity. We use both an approach
of scattering off an external potential, where the gravitational field is
treated as a classical background generated by a heavy source, and the usual
interaction based on the one-graviton-exchange. In the potential appoach we
consider the fields both of a localized and of a distributed gravitational
source of spherical symmetry and uniform density, separating the cases of
interactions taking place both in the inner and external regions of the source.
This allows to make a distinction between interactions involving neutrinos and
dark matter particles with a realistic gravity source, which cover the inner
region, and the rest of the Standard model fermions. The role of the
gravitationally induced flavour-changing transitions, as well as the flavour
diagonal ones, are investigated in the limit of both large and small momentum
transfers, deriving the structure of the corresponding Hamiltonian.

  No-Regret Algorithms",,,,,"cs.LG cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Approachability theory, introduced by Blackwell (1956), provides fundamental
results on repeated games with vector-valued payoffs, and has been usefully
applied since in the theory of learning in games and to learning algorithms in
the online adversarial setup. Given a repeated game with vector payoffs, a
target set $S$ is approachable by a certain player (the agent) if he can ensure
that the average payoff vector converges to that set no matter what his
adversary opponent does. Blackwell provided two equivalent sets of conditions
for a convex set to be approachable. The first (primary) condition is a
geometric separation condition, while the second (dual) condition requires that
the set be {\em non-excludable}, namely that for every mixed action of the
opponent there exists a mixed action of the agent (a {\em response}) such that
the resulting payoff vector belongs to $S$. Existing approachability algorithms
rely on the primal condition and essentially require to compute at each stage a
projection direction from a given point to $S$. In this paper, we introduce an
approachability algorithm that relies on Blackwell's {\em dual} condition.
Thus, rather than projection, the algorithm relies on computation of the
response to a certain action of the opponent at each stage. The utility of the
proposed algorithm is demonstrated by applying it to certain generalizations of
the classical regret minimization problem, which include regret minimization
with side constraints and regret minimization for global cost functions. In
these problems, computation of the required projections is generally complex
but a response is readily obtainable.

states, using a full three-dimensional micromagnetic model including

energy states in helimagnetic thin film nanostructures at zero external

We show that bistable skyrmionic textures undergo hysteretic behaviour between

even in absence of both magnetocrystalline and demagnetisation-based shape
anisotropies, suggesting the existence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-based shape

A subset
$X \subset G$ is called Haar null (in the sense of Christensen) if there exists
a Borel set $B \supset X$ and a Borel probability measure $\mu$ on $G$ such
that $\mu(B+g)=0$ for every $g \in G$. The term shy is also commonly used for
Haar null, and co-Haar null sets are often called prevalent.
  Answering an old question of Mycielski we show that if $G$ is not locally
compact then there exists a Borel Haar null set that is not contained in any
$G_\delta$ Haar null set. We also show that $G_\delta$ can be replaced by any
other class of the Borel hierarchy, which implies that the additivity of the
$\sigma$-ideal of Haar null sets is $\omega_1$.
  The definition of a generalised Haar null set is obtained by replacing the
Borelness of $B$ in the above definition by universal measurability. We give an
example of a generalised Haar null set that is not Haar null, more precisely we
construct a coanalytic generalised Haar null set without a Borel Haar null
hull. This solves Problem GP from Fremlin's problem list. Actually, all our
results readily generalise to all Polish groups that admit a two-sided
invariant metric.

Lipschitz in the Carnot-Caratheodory metric, then $[D,f]$ extends to an
$L^2$-bounded operator. Using interpolation, it implies sharp weak--Schatten
class properties for the commutator between zeroth order operators and H\""older
continuous functions. We present applications to sub-Riemannian spectral
triples on Heisenberg manifolds as well as to the regularization of a
functional studied by Englis-Guo-Zhang.

number of snapshots) under uncorrelated sources. Other merits of SPA include
improved resolution, applicability to arbitrary number of snapshots, robustness
to correlation of the sources and no requirement of user-parameters. Numerical

these mini-emitters as a function time define a broad slow component for each
ICMART event. A GRB light curve is usually composed of multiple ICMART events
that are fundamentally driven by the erratic GRB central engine activity.
Allowing variations of the model parameters, one is able to reproduce a variety
of light curves and the power density spectra as observed.

catalogs of asteroid physical observations have also increased, although the
number of objects is still smaller than in the orbital catalogs. We developed a
new approach to the asteroid family classification by combining the
Hierarchical Clustering Method (HCM) with a method to add new members to
existing families. This procedure makes use of the much larger amount of
information contained in the proper elements catalogs, with respect to
classifications using also physical observations for a smaller number of
asteroids. Our work is based on the large catalog of the high accuracy
synthetic proper elements (available from AstDyS). We first identify a number
of core families; to these we attribute the next layer of smaller objects.
Then, we remove all the family members from the catalog, and reapply the HCM to
the rest. This gives both halo families which extend the core families and new
independent families, consisting mainly of small asteroids. These two cases are
discriminated by another step of attribution of new members and by merging
intersecting families. By using information from absolute magnitudes, we take
advantage of the larger size range in some families to analyze their shape in
the proper semimajor axis vs. inverse diameter plane. This leads to a new
method to estimate the family age (or ages). The results from the previous
steps are then analyzed, using also auxiliary information on physical
properties including WISE albedos and SDSS color indexes. This allows to solve
some difficult cases of families overlapping in the proper elements space but
generated by different collisional events. We analyze some examples of
cratering families (Massalia, Vesta, Eunomia) which show internal structures,
interpreted as multiple collisions. We also discuss why Ceres has no family.

thermal properties of three free-standing single crystalline Si membranes with
thickness of 250, 1000, and 2000 nm. We show that for 2-dimensional materials

exponential decay of the thermal field, $T \propto exp[-A \cdot ln(r)]$. The
results demonstrate the full potential of this new contactless method for
quantitative determination of thermal properties. The range of materials to

discovered in a case-control sequencing study for prediction or validation in
an external prospective study. When genotyping only the SNPs polymorphic in the
sequence data, the phenotype to AC correlation tends to be larger in the
replication data than the primary study. Conversely, if the replication sample
is sequenced, ACs of SNPs which are novel in the replication tend to have much
smaller or opposite signed associations. We explain this by first deriving the
AC-phenotype association implied by a model of diverse SNP effects, and second
accounting for the shifted distribution of SNP effects when using a
case-control study as a filter for SNP inclusion. In rare diseases, the case
population is depleted of protective SNPs and enriched for deleterious SNPs,
creating the above difference in AC associations. This phenomenon is most
relevant in re-sequencing for risk prediction in rare diseases with
heterogeneous rare mutations because it applies to SNPs with MAF near 1 out of
the case-control sample size and is exaggerated when SNP log-odds ratios come
from a heavy-tailed distribution. It also suggests a ``winner's curse'' in
which most risk increasing SNPs at a particular MAF are quickly discovered and
future sequencing finds more protective or irrelevant SNPs.

for a simple 50nm-long plasmonic shutter, the modulation contrast can exceed
30dB. The plasmonic shutter is further extended to build a 4-port active power
splitter and an 8-port active network, both based on GNR cross-junction
waveguides. For the active power splitter, the GSP power transmission at each
waveguide arm can be independently controlled by an applied gate-voltage with
high modulation contrast and nearly-equal power-splitting proportions. From the
construct of the 8-port active network, we see that it is possible to scale up

distributions for open quantum systems is that both the NE and many-body (MB)
effects are taken into account in the statistics of the finite size system
connected to reservoirs. We develop an alternative scheme to calculate the NE
steady state properties of such systems. The method, using NE distribution and
spectral functions, presents several advantages, and is equivalent to
conventional steady-state NE Green's functions (NEGF) calculations when the
same level of approximation for the MB interaction is used. The advantages of
our method resides in the fact that the NE distribution and spectral functions
have better analytic behaviour for numerical calculations. Furthermore our
approach offer the possibility of introducing further approximations, not only
at the level of the MB interaction as in NEGF, but also at the level of the
functional form used for the NE distributions. For the single level model with
electron-phonon coupling we have considered, such approximations provide a good
representation of the exact results, for either the NE distributions themselves
or the transport properties. We also derive the formal extensions of our method
for systems consisting of several electronic levels and several vibration
modes.

response is key to understanding off-target and unexpected drug effects, and
for developing hypotheses on how to tailor drug thera-pies. New methods are
required for integrated analyses of a large number of chemical features of
drugs against the corresponding genome-wide responses of multiple cell models.
Results: In this paper, we present the first comprehensive multi-set analysis
on how the chemical structure of drugs impacts on ge-nome-wide gene expression
across several cancer cell lines (CMap database). The task is formulated as
searching for drug response components across multiple cancers to reveal shared
effects of drugs and the chemical features that may be responsible. The
com-ponents can be computed with an extension of a very recent ap-proach called
Group Factor Analysis (GFA). We identify 11 compo-nents that link the
structural descriptors of drugs with specific gene expression responses
observed in the three cell lines, and identify structural groups that may be
responsible for the responses. Our method quantitatively outperforms the
limited earlier studies on CMap and identifies both the previously reported
associations and several interesting novel findings, by taking into account
multiple cell lines and advanced 3D structural descriptors. The novel
observations include: previously unknown similarities in the effects induced by
15-delta prostaglandin J2 and HSP90 inhibitors, which are linked to the 3D
descriptors of the drugs; and the induction by simvastatin of leukemia-specific
anti-inflammatory response, resem-bling the effects of corticosteroids.

have been shown to contribute to memory consolidation, an effect that can be
enhanced by electrical stimulation. As the precise underlying working
mechanisms are not known it is desired to develop and analyze computational
models of slow oscillations and to study the response to electrical stimuli. In
this paper we employ the conductance based model of Compte et al. [J
Neurophysiol 89, 2707] to study the effect of electrical stimulation. The
population response to electrical stimulation depends on the timing of the
stimulus with respect to the state of the slow oscillation. First, we reproduce
the experimental results of electrical stimulation in ferret brain slices by
Shu et al. [Nature 423, 288] from the conductance based model. We then
numerically obtain the phase response curve for the conductance based network
model to quantify the network's response to weak stimuli. Our results agree
with experiments in vivo and in vitro that show that sensitivity to stimulation
is weaker in the up than in the down state. However, we also find that within
the up state stimulation leads to a shortening of the up state, or phase
advance, whereas during the up-down transition a prolongation of up states is
possible, resulting in a phase delay. Finally, we compute the phase response
curve for the simple mean-field model by Ngo et al. [Europhys Lett 89, 68002]

different mechanism for the generation of slow oscillations.

to decompose the delta function of a non-compact Lorentz group into the
convergent sum of the matrix coefficients. We calculate the vertex amplitude
with the help of that theorem and obtain a simple expression for our model. The
$SL(2,C)$ Hilbert space is defined from $SU(2)$ Hilbert space by
Huebschmann-Kirillov transform \cite{Huebschmann}. A new transform is simpler
than the well known Hall transform as it does not contain a heat kernel
convolution. We do not set Barbero-Immirzi constant $\gamma$ a priori, instead

constraints being $\gamma = \frac{-in}{(|n| + 2p)}$ where $p$ is a non-negative
half-integer. When $p=0$ the solution corresponds to the Ashtekar's self-dual

splits/introgressions involving Neanderthal genes into out-of- Africa people,
or Denisovan genes into Oceanians, a further series of archaic splits and
hypotheses proposed in Waddell et al. (2011) are considered in detail. These
include signals of Denisovans with something markedly more archaic and possibly
something more archaic into Papuans as well. These are compared and contrasted
with some well-advertised introgressions such as Denisovan genes across East
Asia, archaic genes into San or non-tree mixing between Oceanians, East Asians
and Europeans. The general result is that these less appreciated and surprising
archaic splits have just as much or more support in genome sequence data.
Further, evaluation confirms the hypothesis that archaic genes are much rarer
on modern X chromosomes, and may even be near totally absent, suggesting strong
selection against their introgression. Modeling of relative split weights
allows an inference of the proportion of the genome the Denisovan seems to have
gotten from an older archaic, and the best estimate is around 2%. Using a mix
of quantitative and qualitative morphological data and novel phylogenetic
methods, robust support is found for multiple distinct middle Pleistocene
lineages. Of these, fossil hominids such as SH5, Petralona, and Dali, in
particular, look like prime candidates for contributing pre-Neanderthal/Modern
archaic genes to Denisovans, while the Jinniu-Shan fossil looks like the best
candidate for a close relative of the Denisovan. That the Papuans might have
received some truly archaic genes appears a good possibility and they might
even be from Homo erectus.

  Classification","17 pages",,,,"stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-task learning has shown to significantly enhance the performance of
multiple related learning tasks in a variety of situations. We present the
fused logistic regression, a sparse multi-task learning approach for binary
classification. Specifically, we introduce sparsity inducing penalties over
parameter differences of related logistic regression models to encode
similarity across related tasks. The resulting joint learning task is cast into
a form that lends itself to be efficiently optimized with a recursive variant
of the alternating direction method of multipliers. We show results on
synthetic data and describe the regime of settings where our multi-task
approach achieves significant improvements over the single task learning
approach and discuss the implications on applying the fused logistic regression
in different real world settings.

model with double free boundaries in one space dimension. This system models
the expanding of an invasive or new predator species in which the free
boundaries represent expanding fronts of the predator species and are described
by Stefan-like condition. We prove a spreading-vanishing dichotomy for this
model, namely the predator species either successfully spreads to infinity as
$t\to \infty$ at both fronts and survives in the new environment, or it fails
to establish and dies out in the long run while the prey species stabilizes at
a positive equilibrium state. The long time behavior of solution and criteria
for spreading and vanishing are also obtained.

formula for short times and arrive at approximate expressions for the
mean-squared dispersion which involve second order structure functions of the
velocity and acceleration fields. For the stochastic trajectories, we
analytically compute an exact $t^3$ contribution to the squared separation of
stochastic paths. We argue that this contribution appears also for
deterministic paths at long times and present direct numerical simulation
results for incompressible Navier-Stokes flows to support this claim. We also
numerically compute the probability distribution of particle separations for
the deterministic paths and the stochastic paths and show their strong
self-similar nature.

of a fourth rank tensor interaction, derived by Kennedy (1972), is used to
check Mach's principle in a homogeneous isotropic expanding universe. The
Lagrangian is found to be consistent with Mach's principle when the density is
the critical density and inertial mass is suitably renormalized. The Kennedy
approach only gives the Lagrangian to first order in the gravitational coupling
constant. By invoking the equivalence principle higher order corrections are
found which renormalize the gravitational masses to the same values as the
inertial masses. It is not the same as the correction derived from general
relativity by Einstein-Infeld-Hoffmann, but otherwise the Lagrangians agree.

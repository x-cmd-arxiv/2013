  dynamical systems",,,,,"cs.CG cs.LG math.DS nlin.CD physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Complex systems are commonly modeled using nonlinear dynamical systems. These
models are often high-dimensional and chaotic. An important goal in studying
physical systems through the lens of mathematical models is to determine when
the system undergoes changes in qualitative behavior. A detailed description of
the dynamics can be difficult or impossible to obtain for high-dimensional and
chaotic systems. Therefore, a more sensible goal is to recognize and mark
transitions of a system between qualitatively different regimes of behavior. In
practice, one is interested in developing techniques for detection of such
transitions from sparse observations, possibly contaminated by noise. In this
paper we develop a framework to accurately tag different regimes of complex
systems based on topological features. In particular, our framework works with
a high degree of success in picking out a cyclically orbiting regime from a
stationary equilibrium regime in high-dimensional stochastic dynamical systems.

Energy Astrophysics. Gas detectors based on photoelectric effect have paved the
way for the design of sensitive instruments and mission proposals based on them
have been presented in the last few years in the energy range from about 2 keV
to a few tens of keV. As well, a number of polarimeters based on Compton
scattering are approved or discussed for launch on-board balloons or space
satellites at higher energies. These instruments are typically dedicated to
pointed observations with narrow field of view telescopes or collimators, but
there are also projects aimed at the polarimetry of bright transient sources,
like Soft Gamma Repeaters or the prompt emission of Gamma Ray Bursts. Given the
erratic appearance of such events in the sky, these polarimeters have a large
field of view to catch a reasonable number of them and, as a result, photons
may impinge on the detector off-axis. This changes dramatically the response of
the instrument to polarization, regardless if photoabsorption or Compton
scattering is involved. Instead of the simple cosine square dependency expected
for polarized photons which are incident on-axis, the response is never purely
cosinusoidal and a systematic modulation appears also for unpolarized
radiation. We investigate the origin of these differences and present an
analytic treatment which proves that actually such systematic effects are the
natural consequence of how current instruments operate. Our analysis provides
the expected response of photoelectric or Compton polarimeters to photons
impinging with any inclination and state of polarization.

propose a basic extension to work-stealing that provides good scalability, but
cannot provide any guarantees for task-ordering in-between threads. Next, we
present a centralized priority data structure based on $k$-fifo queues, which
provides strong (but still relaxed with regard to a sequential specification)

to integrality gap upper bounds for the TSP with distances one and two, for
both undirected and directed graphs.
  Our main results concern the subtour elimination relaxation with one
additional cutting plane inequality:
  - For undirected instances we obtain an integrality gap upper bound of 5/4
without any further restrictions, of 7/6 if the optimal LP solution is
half-integral.
  - For instances of order n where the fractional LP value has a cost of n, we
obtain a tight integrality gap upper bound of 10/9 if there is an optimal
solution with subcubic support graph. The latter property that the graph is
subcubic is implied if the solution is a basic solution in the fractional
2-matching polytope.
  - For directed instances we obtain an integrality gap upper bound of 3/2, and
of 4/3 if given an optimal 1/2-integral solution. In the case of undirected
graphs, we can avoid to add the cutting plane inequality if we accept slightly
increased values. For the tight result, the cutting plane is not required.
  Additionally, we show that relying on the structure of the support is not an
artefact of our algorithm, but is necessary under standard complexity-theoretic
assumptions: we show that finding improved solutions via local search is
W[1]-hard for k-edge change neighborhoods even for the TSP with distances one

improved future experiment. A correlated prediction of the heaviest neutrino
lifetimes from radiative decays to the lighter neutrinos via exchange of

half-filled 4f shell, divalent europium is an outstanding element for
assembling novel magnetic devices in which a two-dimensional electron gas
(2DEG) is polarized due to exchange interaction with an underlying
magnetically-active Eu layer, even in the absence of a magnetic field. A
natural example for such geometry is the intermetallic layered material
EuRh$_2$Si$_2$, in which magnetically active layers of Eu are well separated
from each other by non-magnetic Si-Rh-Si trilayers. Applying angle-resolved
photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) to this system, we discovered a large spin
splitting of a Shockley-type surface state formed by itinerant electrons of the
Si-Rh-Si surface related trilayer. ARPES shows that the splitting sets in below
approx. 32.5K and quickly saturates to around 150meV upon cooling.
Interestingly, this temperature is substantially higher than the order
temperature of the Eu 4f moments (approx. 24.5K) in the bulk. Our results
clearly show that the magnetic exchange interaction between the surface state
and the buried 4f moments in the 4th subsurface layer is the driving force for
the formation of itinerant ferromagnetism at the surface. We demonstrate that
the observed spin splitting of the surface state, reflecting properties of
2DEG, is easily controlled by temperature. Such a splitting may also be induced
into states of functional surface layers deposited onto the surface of
EuRh$_2$Si$_2$ or similarly ordered magnetic materials with metallic or
semiconducting properties.

the cilia and a fluid mixing region below the cilia tip. The metachronal wave
due to phase differences between neighboring cilia is known to enhance the
fluid transport above the ciliary tip. In this work, we show that the
metachronal wave also enhances the mixing rates in the sub-ciliary region,

this simultaneous enhancement in transport and mixing is due to an enhancement
in shear flow. As the flow above the cilia increases, shear rate in the fluid
increases and such shear enhances stretching, which is an essential ingredient
for mixing. Estimates of the mixing time scale indicate that, compared to
diffusion, the mixing due to the cilia beat may be significant and sometimes
dominates chemical diffusion.

its outermost kilometer, is set by heating from nuclear reactions at large

crust has been thought to affect observable phenomena at shallower depths, such
as thermonuclear bursts in the accreted envelope. Here we report that cycles of
electron capture and its inverse, $\beta^-$ decay, involving neutron-rich
nuclei at a typical depth of about 150 m, cool the outer neutron star crust by
emitting neutrinos while also thermally decoupling the surface layers from the
deeper crust. This Urca mechanism has been studied in the context of white
dwarfs and Type Ia supernovae, but hitherto was not considered in neutron
stars, because previous models computed the crust reactions using a
zero-temperature approximation and assumed that only a single nuclear species
was present at any given depth. This thermal decoupling means that X-ray bursts
and other surface phenomena are largely independent of the strength of deep
crustal heating. The unexpectedly short recurrence times, of the order of
years, observed for very energetic thermonuclear superbursts are therefore not
an indicator of a hot crust, but may point instead to an unknown local heating
mechanism near the neutron star surface.

distribution has a Lebesgue density with a polynomial tail, we derive the

for the pieces and one for the concatenation of the pieces. We also obtain a
quenched LDP when the tail decays faster than algebraic. The proof uses
coarse-graining and truncation arguments, involving various approximations of
specific relative entropies that are not quite standard.

we supplement with ground based observations of the CO $J=1-0$, $J=2-1$ and

Using the CO and [CI] transitions, we perform both a LTE analysis of [CI], and

transfer code RADEX along with a Bayesian likelihood analysis. We find that
there are two components to the molecular gas: a cold ($T_{kin}\sim 10-30$ K)
and a warm ($T_{kin} \gtrsim 100$ K) component. By comparing the warm gas mass
to previously observed values, we determine a CO abundance in the warm gas of
$x_{CO} \sim 5\times 10^{-5}$. If the CO abundance is the same in the warm and
cold gas phases, this abundance corresponds to a CO $J=1-0$ luminosity-to-mass
conversion factor of $\alpha_{CO} \sim 7 \ M_{\odot}{pc^{-2} \ (K \ km \

galaxies. We estimate the cooling from H$_2$, [CII], CO and [OI]$63\mu m$ to be
$\sim 0.01 L_{\odot}/M_{\odot}$. We compare PDR models to the ratio of the flux
of various CO transitions, along with the ratio of the CO flux to the
far-infrared flux in NGC 4038, NGC 4039 and the overlap region. We find that
the densities recovered from our non-LTE analysis are consistent with a
background far-ultraviolet field of strength $G_0\sim 1000$. Finally, we find
that a combination of turbulent heating, due to the ongoing merger, and
supernova and stellar winds are sufficient to heat the molecular gas.

distributed multi-robot system with wifi communication capabilities has been
developed and used to implement a Mobile Ad-hoc NETwork (MANET) to guarantee
the required multi-hop communication. None of the robots of the team possess
the knowledge of agent's movement, neither they hold a pre-assigned position in
the ad-hoc network but they adapt with respect to the dynamic environmental
situations. This adaptation only requires the robots to have the knowledge of
their position and the possibility to exchange such information with their
one-hop neighbours. Robots' motion is achieved by implementing a behavioural
control, namely the Null-Space based Behavioural control, embedding the
collective mission to achieve the required self-configuration. Validation of
the approach is performed by means of demanding experimental tests involving
five ground mobile robots capable of self localization and dynamic obstacle
avoidance.

features both in the superconducting and in the normal state. Different
families differ in the value of the critical temperature, in the shape of the
Fermi surface, in the existence or absence of quasi-nesting conditions, in the
range of doping in which the antiferromagnetic (AFM) and the superconducting
phase coexist and in the structure of the order parameter in the reciprocal
space, and so on. In this paper the most important results of point-contact
spectroscopy (PCS) in Fe-based superconductors are reviewed, and the most
recent advances are described with the aim to discuss the future perspectives
and challenges of this spectroscopic technique in the characterization of the
superconducting properties of these complex compounds. One of the main
challenges, faced so far only by a few researchers in the PCS field, is to
fully explore the phase diagram of these materials, as a function of doping or
pressure, to understand the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism,
the effect of intrinsic or extrinsic inhomogeneities, the role of spin
fluctuations (SFs) in the pairing, the symmetry and the structure of the order
parameter(s).

lattice: The hierarchical Edward-Anderson model (HEA) of a spin glass, and
Dyson's hierarchical model (DHM) of a ferromagnet. For the HEA, we prove the
existence of the thermodynamic limit of the free energy and the
replica-symmetry-breaking (RSB) free-energy bounds previously derived for the
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model of a spin glass. These RSB mean-field bounds are
exact only if the order-parameter fluctuations (OPF) vanish: Given that such
fluctuations are not negligible in non-mean-field models, we develop a novel
strategy to tackle part of OPF in hierarchical models. The method is based on
absorbing part of OPF of a block of spins into an effective Hamiltonian of the
underlying spin blocks. We illustrate this method for DHM and show that,
compared to the mean-field bound for the free energy, it provides a tighter
non-mean-field bound, with a critical temperature closer to the exact one. To
extend this method to the HEA model, a suitable generalization of Griffith's
correlation inequalities for Ising ferromagnets is needed: Since correlation
inequalities for spin glasses are still an open topic, we leave the extension
of this method to hierarchical spin glasses as a future perspective.

appropriate weights (to adjust for censoring) is sometimes used for parameter
estimation. With Stute's weighted least squares method, when the largest
observation is censored ($Y_{(n)}^+$), it is natural to apply the
redistribution to the right algorithm of Efron (1967). However, Efron's
redistribution algorithm can lead to bias and inefficiency in estimation. This
study explains the issues clearly and proposes some alternative ways of
treating $Y_{(n)}^+$. The first four proposed approaches are based on the well
known Buckley--James (1979) method of imputation with the Efron's tail
correction and the last approach is indirectly based on a general mean
imputation technique in literature. All the new schemes use penalized weighted
least squares optimized by quadratic programming implemented with the
accelerated failure time models. Furthermore, two novel additional imputation
approaches are proposed to impute the tail tied censored observations that are
often found in survival analysis with heavy censoring. Several simulation
studies and real data analysis demonstrated that the proposed approaches
generally outperform Efron's redistribution approach and lead to considerably
smaller mean squared error and bias estimates.

candidate selection technique uses HST/ACS and ESO/WFI photometric data out to
$>\!4.5\,r_c$. We use radial velocity measurements to discard non-members and
achieve a success rate of $\sim93\%$, which yields a sample of 116 confirmed
BSSs. Using the penalized pixel fitting method (pPXF) we measure the $v\sin(i)$
values of the sample BSSs and find their distribution functions peaked at slow
velocities with a long tail towards fast velocities in each globular cluster.
We find that the BSSs in NGC\,3201 and NGC\,6218 which show $v\sin(i)\!>\!50$
km s$^{-1}$ are all found in the central cluster regions, inside a projected
$2\,r_c$, of their parent clusters. We find a similar result in $\omega$Cen for
BSSs with $v\sin(i)\!>\!70$ km s$^{-1}$ which are all, except for two,
concentrated inside $2\,r_c$. In all globular clusters we find rapidly rotating
BSSs that have relatively high differential radial velocities which likely put
them on hyperbolic orbits, suggestive of strong dynamical interactions in the
past. We estimate that all the observed rapidly rotating BSSs are likely to
form in their central cluster regions no longer than $\sim\!300$ Myr ago. Using
dereddened $V\!-\!I$ colors of our photometric selection we show that blue BSSs
in $\omega$Cen with $(V-I)_0$<0.25 mag show a significantly increased
$v\sin(i)$ dispersion compared with their red counterparts and all other BSSs
in our sample, therefore strongly implying that fast rotating BSSs in
$\omega$Cen are preferentially bluer, i.e. more massive. This may indicate that
this particular blue BSS population was formed in an unique formation event

model. In this framework, the standard model (SM) particle spectrum is extended
to include one complex scalar field S and one Dirac fermion \psi. These new
fields are singlets under the SM gauge group and are charged under a global
U(1) symmetry. Breaking of this U(1) symmetry results in a massless Goldstone
boson \alpha and a massive CP-even scalar r, and splits the Dirac fermion into
two new mass-eigenstates \psi_\pm, corresponding to Majorana fermions. The
interest on such a minimal SM extension is twofold. On the one hand, if the
Goldstone bosons are in thermal equilibrium with SM particles until the era of
muon annihilation their contribution to the effective number of neutrino
species can explain the hints from cosmological observations of extra
relativistic degrees of freedom at the epoch of last scattering. On the other
hand, the lightest Majorana fermion \psi_- provides a plausible dark matter
candidate. Mixing of r with the Higgs doublet \phi is characterized by the mass
of hidden scalar m_h and the mixing angle \theta. We constrain this parameter
space using a variety of experimental data, including heavy meson decays with
missing energy, the invisible Higgs width, and direct dark matter searches. We
show that different experimental results compress the allowed parameter space
in complementary ways, covering a large range of \psi_- masses (5 GeV \alt m_-
\alt 100 GeV). Though current results narrow the parameter space significantly
(for the mass range of interest, \theta \alt 10^{-3} to 10^{-4}), there is
still room for discovery (\alpha decoupling at the muon annihilation era
requires \theta \agt 10^{-5} to 10^{-4}). In the near future, measurements from
ATLAS, CMS, LHCb, NA62, XENON1T, LUX, and CDMSlite will probe nearly the full

that can form spontaneously due to frustration in triangular-lattice
antiferromagnets. We explore the magnetic phase diagram up to 65 T along all
the principle axes, and also use electric polarization to probe changes in the
spiral order at high magnetic fields. It is known that at zero magnetic field a
proper-screw spiral of the Cr S = 3/2 spins forms that in turn induces electric
polarization with six possible orientations ab-plane. Applied magnetic fields
in the (hard) ab-plane have been shown to induce a transition to cycloidal
spiral magnetic order above 5.3 T in those domains that have spins
perpendicular to the applied magnetic field. We show that the cycloidal order
remains unchanged all the way up to 65 T, which is one quarter of the
extrapolated saturation magnetization. On the other hand for magnetic fields
along the (easy) c-axis, we observe a transition in the electric polarization
near 45 T, and it is followed by a series of steps and/or oscillations in the
electric polarization. The data is consistent with the a
proper-screw-to-cycloidal transition that is pushed from 5.3 to 45 T by
easy-axis anisotropy, and is in turn followed by stretching of the magnetic
spiral through commensurate and incommensurate wave vectors. This work also
highlights the ability of the magnetically-induced electric polarization to
probe complex magnetic orders in regimes of phase space that are difficult to
reach with neutron diffraction.

of four agents sharing the same opinion may convince its neighbors to follow
the group opinion, which induces an increase of the group's convincing power.
In addition, we have considered that a group with a local majority opinion (3
up/1 down spins or 1 up/3 down spins) can persuade the agents neighboring the
group with probability $p$, since the group's convincing power is high enough.
The two mechanisms (convincing powers and probability $p$) lead to an increase
of the competition among the opinions, which avoids dictatorship (full
consensus, all spins parallel) for a wide range of model's parameters, and
favors the occurrence of democratic states (partial order, the majority of
spins pointing in one direction). We have found that the relaxation times of
the model follow log-normal distributions, and that the average relaxation time
$\tau$ grows with system size as $\tau \sim L^{5/2}$, independent of $p$. We
also discuss the occurrence of the usual phase transition of the Sznajd model.

is an extension of tcc with the ability to express mobility. Here mobility is
understood as communication of private names as typically done for mobile
systems and security protocols. In this paper we consider the denotational
semantics for tcc, and we extend it to a ""collecting"" semantics for utcc based
on closure operators over sequences of constraints. Relying on this semantics,
we formalize a general framework for data flow analyses of tcc and utcc
programs by abstract interpretation techniques. The concrete and abstract
semantics we propose are compositional, thus allowing us to reduce the
complexity of data flow analyses. We show that our method is sound and
parametric with respect to the abstract domain. Thus, different analyses can be
performed by instantiating the framework. We illustrate how it is possible to
reuse abstract domains previously defined for logic programming to perform, for
instance, a groundness analysis for tcc programs. We show the applicability of
this analysis in the context of reactive systems. Furthermore, we make also use
of the abstract semantics to exhibit a secrecy flaw in a security protocol. We
also show how it is possible to make an analysis which may show that tcc
programs are suspension free. This can be useful for several purposes, such as
for optimizing compilation or for debugging.

constraint improves agreement with numerical simulation by sharpening the cores
and transferring some energy to smaller-scale modes. MRS-2 cannot explain
qualitative changes due to rotation, but descriptions that conserve higher
Casimirs beyond enstrophy have the potential to do so. The result is in
agreement with the somewhat paradoxical observation that hyperviscosity helps
to remedy the non-conservation of the third and higher Casimirs in numerical
simulation. For a rotating sphere, numerical simulation also demonstrates that
coherent structures found at late times depend on initial conditions, limiting

theoretical discovery, these materials have encouraged intense efforts to study

activity are proposals to engineer a new variety of superconductor at the
surfaces of topological insulators. These topological superconductors would be
capable of supporting localized Majorana fermions, particles whose braiding
properties have been proposed as the basis of a fault-tolerant quantum
computer. Despite the clear theoretical motivation, a conclusive realization of
topological superconductivity remains an outstanding experimental goal. Here we
present measurements of superconductivity induced in two-dimensional
HgTe/HgCdTe quantum wells, a material which becomes a quantum spin Hall
insulator when the well width exceeds d_{C}=6.3 nm. In wells that are 7.5 nm
wide, we find that supercurrents are confined to the one-dimensional sample
edges as the bulk density is depleted. However, when the well width is
decreased to 4.5 nm the edge supercurrents cannot be distinguished from those
in the bulk. These results provide evidence for superconductivity induced in
the helical edges of the quantum spin Hall effect, a promising step toward the
demonstration of one-dimensional topological superconductivity. Our results
also provide a direct measurement of the widths of these edge channels, which
range from 180 nm to 408 nm.

ways in the first section. As an important example, we present it as the
algebraic intersection of a torus and a 4-chain called a propagator in a
configuration space. In the second section, we introduce the simplest finite
type 3-manifold invariant, which is the Casson invariant (or the
Theta-invariant) of integer homology 3-spheres. It is defined as the algebraic
intersection of three propagators in the same two-point configuration space. In
the third section, we explain the general notion of finite type invariants and
introduce relevant spaces of Feynman Jacobi diagrams. In Sections 4 and 5, we
sketch an original construction based on configuration space integrals of
universal finite type invariants for links in rational homology 3-spheres and
we state open problems. Our construction generalizes the known constructions
for links in the ambient space, and it makes them more flexible. In Section 6,

created, which would deal with objects of two types - propositions and
problems."" We construct such a formal system, as well as its predicate version
QHC, which is a conservative extension of both the intuitionistic predicate
calculus QH and the classical predicate calculus QC.
  The only new connectives ? and ! of QHC induce a Galois connection (i.e., a
pair of adjoint functors) between the Lindenbaum posets (i.e. the underlying
posets of the Lindenbaum algebras) of QH and QC. Kolmogorov's double negation
translation of propositions into problems extends to a retraction of QHC onto
QH; whereas Goedel's provability translation of problems into modal
propositions extends to a retraction of QHC onto its QC+(?!) fragment,
identified with the modal logic QS4. The QH+(!?) fragment is an intuitionistic
modal logic, whose modality !? is a strict lax modality in the sense of Aczel -
and thus resembles the squash/bracket operation in intuitionistic type
theories.
  The axioms of QHC attempt to give a fuller formalization (with respect to the
axioms of intuitionistic logic) to the two best known contentual
interpretations of intiuitionistic logic: Kolmogorov's problem interpretation
(incorporating standard refinements by Heyting and Kreisel) and the proof
interpretation by Orlov and Heyting (as clarified by G\""odel). While these two
interpretations are often conflated, from the viewpoint of the axioms of QHC
neither of them reduces to the other one, although they do overlap.

SNe using combined photometric and spectroscopic observations, finding two of
the three to be clearly of type SN Ia and the third probable. The SNe exhibit
significant amplification, up to a factor of 1.7 at $\sim5\sigma$ significance
(SN-L2). We conducted this as a blind study to avoid fine tuning of parameters,
finding a mean amplification difference between SNe and the cluster lensing
models of $0.09 \pm 0.09^{stat} \pm 0.05^{sys}$ mag. This impressive agreement
suggests no tension between cluster mass models and high redshift standardized
SNe Ia. However, the measured statistical dispersion of $\sigma_{\mu}=0.21$ mag
appeared large compared to the dispersion expected based on statistical
uncertainties ($0.14$). Further work with the supernova and cluster lensing

$\sigma_{\mu}=0.12$. An explicit choice should thus be made as to whether SNe
are used unblinded to improve the model, or blinded to test the model. As the

scientific interest and industrial importance. The majority of algorithms to
date have been based on a second-quantized representation of the electronic
structure Hamiltonian - necessitating qubit requirements that scale linearly
with the number of orbitals. The scaling of the number of gates for such
methods, while polynomial, presents some serious experimental challenges.
However, because the number of electrons is a good quantum number for the
electronic structure problem it is unnecessary to store the full Fock space of
the orbitals. Representation of the wave function in a basis of Slater
determinants for fixed electron number suffices. However, to date techniques
for the quantum simulation of the Hamiltonian represented in this basis - the
CI-matrix - have been lacking. We show how to apply techniques developed for
the simulation of sparse Hamiltonians to the CI-matrix. We prove a number of
results exploiting the structure of the CI-matrix, arising from the Slater
rules which define it, to improve the application of sparse Hamiltonian
simulation techniques in this case. We show that it is possible to use the
minimal number of qubits to represent the wavefunction, and that these methods
can offer improved scaling in the number of gates required in the limit of
fixed electron number and increasing basis set size relevant for high-accuracy
calculations. We hope these results open the door to further investigation of
sparse Hamiltonian simulation techniques in the context of the quantum
simulation of quantum chemistry.

and ~4 Gyr ago. Their relative importance varies from a similar amount of stars
formed in the two epochs in the innermost field, to only 40% of the stars

star formation or ram-pressure stripping, or from to the compression of the gas

Moreover, the information about singular limits significantly simplifies
finding boundary constants for the differential equations. To illustrate these
points we consider two families of three-loop integrals. The first are
form-factor integrals with two external legs on the light cone. We introduce
one more scale by taking one more leg off-shell, $p_2^2\neq 0$. We analytically
solve the differential equations for the master integrals in a Laurent
expansion in dimensional regularization with $\epsilon=(4-D)/2$. Then we show
how to obtain analytic results for the corresponding one-scale integrals in an

the differential equations in the limit of small $p_2^2$ to our results at
$p_2^2\neq 0$ and to identify various terms in these solutions according to
expansion by regions. The second family consists of four-point non-planar
integrals with all four legs on the light cone. We evaluate, by differential
equations, all the master integrals for the so-called $K_4$ graph consisting of
four external vertices which are connected with each other by six lines. We

charm quark. The second one turns out to be particularly strong, and we
quantify its impact on models that allow for a sizeable flavour violation in
the up quark sector, like flavour alignment and Generic U(2)^3. In particular
we show how the bounds coming from the charm and up CEDMs constrain the size of
new physics contributions to direct flavour violation in D decays. We also
specialize our analysis to the cases of Supersymmetry with split families and
composite Higgs models. The results exposed in this paper motivate both an
increase in experimental sensitivity to fundamental hadronic dipoles, and a
further exploration of the SM contribution to flavour violating D decays.

bosons to light sbottom pairs are, in a fairly model independent manner,
strongly constrained by the precision electroweak data and Higgs signal
strength measurements, respectively. These constraints are complementary to
direct collider searches, which depend in detail on assumptions regarding the
superpartner spectrum and decays of the sbottom. In particular, if the lightest
sbottom has a mass below about 15 GeV, compatibility with these measurements is
possible only in a special region of parameter space in which the couplings of
the lightest sbottom to the Z and Higgs are suppressed. In this region, the
second sbottom is predicted to be lighter than about 300 GeV and can also be
searched for directly at the LHC. We also survey relevant collider searches for
canonical scenarios with a bino, gravitino, or singlino LSP in the compressed
and stealth kinematic regimes and provide suggestions to cover remaining open
regions of parameter space.

observational constraints on the allowed distortions of $z$ away from $z_{obs}$

dynamics for either $d_L(z)$ or $H(z)$ observations alone: for example, the
simple remapping $z = \alpha_1 z_{obs} +\alpha_2 z_{obs}^2$ allows a
decelerating Einstein de Sitter universe to fit the observed supernova Hubble

cannot prove that the universe is accelerating. We show however, that redshift
remapping leads to apparent violations of cosmic distance duality that can be
used to detect its presence even when neither a specific theory of gravity nor
the Copernican Principle are assumed. Combining current data sets favours
acceleration but does not yet rule out redshift remapping as an alternative to
dark energy. Future surveys, however, will provide exquisite constraints on
remapping and any models -- such as backreaction -- that predict it.

understanding of the processes by which gas loses angular momentum and falls

subsequently guiding the inflow of gas down to the black hole horizon. It is
feared that gas at larger scales might still retain enough angular momentum and
settle into a larger scale disc with very low or no inflow to form or replenish
the inner accretion disc (on ~0.01 pc scales). In this paper we report on
hydrodynamical simulations of rotating infalling gas shells impacting at
different angles onto a pre-existing, primitive large scale (~10 pc) disc
around a super-massive black hole. The aim is to explore how the interaction
between the shell and the disc redistributes the angular momentum on scales
close to the black hole's sphere of influence. Angular momentum redistribution
via hydrodynamical shocks leads to inflows of gas across the inner boundary,
enhancing the inflow rate by more than 2-3 orders of magnitude. In all cases,
the gas inflow rate across the inner parsec is higher than in the absence of
the interaction, and the orientation of the angular momentum of the flow in the
region changes with time due to gas mixing. Warped discs or nested misaligned
rings form depending on the angular momentum content of the infalling shell
relative to the disc. In the cases in which the shell falls in near
counter-rotation, part of the resulting flows settle into an inner dense disc
which becomes more susceptible to mass transfer.

this scenario can provide a natural origin for the dark sector of the universe
with a clear geometrical interpretation: dark energy is identified with the
scalar field associated to the D-brane's position as it moves in the internal
space, acting as quintessence, while dark matter is identified with the matter

thus constrained by the theory. The resulting cosmologies are studied using
both dynamical system analysis and numerics. From the dynamical system point of
view, one free parameter controls the cosmological dynamics, given by the ratio
of the warp factor and the potential energy scales. The disformal coupling
allows for new scaling solutions that can describe accelerating cosmologies
alleviating the coincidence problem of dark energy. In addition, this scenario
may ameliorate the fine-tuning problem of dark energy, whose small value may be
attained dynamically, without requiring the mass of the dark energy field to be

compute from molecular properties the emergent length and time scales that
govern the nonequilibrium relaxation behavior of amorphous ice prepared by
rapid cooling. Upon cooling, the liquid water falls out of equilibrium whereby
the temperature dependence of its relaxation time is predicted to change from
super-Arrhenius to Arrhenius. A consequence of this crossover is that the
location of the apparent glass transition temperature depends logarithmically
on cooling rate. Accompanying vitrification is the emergence of a dynamical
length-scale, the size of which depends on the cooling rate and varies between
angstroms and 10s of nanometers. While this protocol dependence clarifies a
number of previous experimental observations for amorphous ice, the arguments
are general and can be extended to other glass forming liquids.

of only kG strength in some and including hG strengths in others. In order to
understand the differences between measurements reported in the literature, and
to reconcile them with results from theory, we analyze the distribution of
magnetic field strength of G-band bright features identified on synthetic
images of the solar photosphere, and its sensitivity to observational and
methodological effects. We investigate the dependence of magnetic field
strength distributions of G-band bright points identified in 3D
magnetohydrodynamic simulations on feature selection method, data sampling,
alignment and spatial resolution. The distribution of magnetic field strength
of G-band bright features shows two peaks, one at about 1.5 kG and one below 1
hG. The former corresponds to magnetic features,the second mostly to bright
granules. Peaks at several hG are obtained only on spatially degraded or
misalligned data. Simulations show that magnetic G-band bright points have
typically associated field strengths of few kG. Field strengths in the hG range
can result from observational effects, thus explaining the discrepancies
presented in the literature. Our results also indicate that outcomes from
spectro-polarimetric inversions with imposed unit filling-factor should be
employed with great caution.

cosmic rays in the interstellar medium of disk galaxies such as the Milky Way.
However, thus far cosmological simulations of the formation and evolution of
galaxies have usually neglected magnetic fields. We employ the moving-mesh code
\textsc{Arepo} to follow for the first time the formation and evolution of a
Milky Way-like disk galaxy in its full cosmological context while taking into
account magnetic fields. We find that a prescribed tiny magnetic seed field
grows exponentially by a small-scale dynamo until it saturates around $z=4$
with a magnetic energy of about $10\%$ of the kinetic energy in the center of
the galaxy's main progenitor halo. By $z=2$, a well-defined gaseous disk forms
in which the magnetic field is further amplified by differential rotation,
until it saturates at an average field strength of $\sim 6 \mug$ in the disk
plane. In this phase, the magnetic field is transformed from a chaotic
small-scale field to an ordered large-scale field coherent on scales comparable
to the disk radius. The final magnetic field strength, its radial profile and
the stellar structure of the disk compare well with observational data. A minor
merger temporarily increases the magnetic field strength by about a factor of
two, before it quickly decays back to its saturation value. Our results are
highly insensitive to the initial seed field strength and suggest that the
large-scale magnetic field in spiral galaxies can be explained as a result of
the cosmic structure formation process.

The main contributions are threefold. First, we introduce a new framework for

methods where interpolation is forced on some of the leading subsystem transfer
functions, the new framework shows how to enforce multipoint interpolation of
the underlying Volterra series. Then, we show that the first-order conditions
for optimal H2 model reduction of bilinear systems require multivariate Hermite
interpolation in terms of the new Volterra series interpolation framework; and
thus we extend the interpolation-based first-order necessary conditions for H2
optimality of LTI systems to the bilinear case. Finally, we show that
multipoint interpolation on the truncated Volterra series representation of a

reduction, leading to an efficient model reduction algorithm. Several numerical

However, existing highly-concurrent search trees such as red-black trees and

  This paper presents DeltaTree, a practical locality-aware concurrent search
tree that combines both locality-optimisation techniques from vEB-based trees
and concurrency-optimisation techniques from non-blocking highly-concurrent
search trees. DeltaTree is a $k$-ary leaf-oriented tree of DeltaNodes in which
each DeltaNode is a size-fixed tree-container with the van Emde Boas layout.
The expected memory transfer costs of DeltaTree's Search, Insert, and Delete
operations are $O(\log_B N)$, where $N, B$ are the tree size and the unknown
memory block size in the ideal cache model, respectively. DeltaTree's Search
operation is wait-free, providing prioritised lanes for Search operations, the
dominant operation in search trees. Its Insert and {\em Delete} operations are
non-blocking to other Search, Insert, and Delete operations, but they may be
occasionally blocked by maintenance operations that are sometimes triggered to
keep DeltaTree in good shape. Our experimental evaluation using the latest
implementation of AVL, red-black, and speculation friendly trees from the
Synchrobench benchmark has shown that DeltaTree is up to 5 times faster than
all of the three concurrent search trees for searching operations and up to 1.6
times faster for update operations when the update contention is not too high.

which may consume over 10, 000 Kilowatts per day for cooling and ventilation.
To save energy for the HVAC systems, it is critically important to firstly know
the ""load signatures"" of the HVAC system, i.e., the quantity of heat imported
from the outdoor environments and by the passengers respectively in different
periods of a day, which will significantly benefit the design of control
policies. In this paper, we present a novel sensing and learning approach to
identify the load signature of the HVAC system in the subway stations. In
particular, sensors and smart meters were deployed to monitor the indoor,
outdoor temperatures, and the energy consumptions of the HVAC system in
real-time. The number of passengers was counted by the ticket checking system.
At the same time, the cooling supply provided by the HVAC system was inferred
via the energy consumption logs of the HVAC system. Since the indoor
temperature variations are driven by the difference of the loads and the
cooling supply, linear regression model was proposed for the load signature,
whose coefficients are derived via a proposed algorithm . We collected real
sensing data and energy log data from HaiDianHuangZhuang Subway station, which
is in line 4 of Beijing from the duration of July 2012 to Sept. 2012. The data
was used to evaluate the coefficients of the regression model. The experiment
results show typical variation signatures of the loads from the passengers and
from the outdoor environments respectively, which provide important contexts
for smart control policies.

was first pointed out by Haldane that the non-commutative geometry of the
fractional quantum Hall effects (FQHE) plays an important role in the
intra-Landau-level dynamics. The geometrical aspects of the FQHE will be
illustrated by calculating the linear response to a spatially varying
electromagnetic field, and by a numerical scheme for constructing model
wavefunctions for the neutral bulk excitations. Compared to early studies of
the magneto-roton modes with single mode approximation (SMA), the scheme
presented in this thesis is good not only in the long wavelength limit, but
also for large momenta where the neutral excitations evolve into
quasihole-quasiparticle pair. It is also shown that in the long wavelength
limit, the SMA scheme produces exact model wavefunctions describing a
quadrupole excitation. The same scheme can also extend to describe the neutral
fermion mode in the Moore-Read state, reflecting its non-Abelian nature.
  The numerically generated model wavefunctions are then identified with a
family of analytic wavefunctions that describe both the magneto-roton modes and
the neutral fermion modes. Like the ground state wavefunction of the Laughlin

presence of bosonic modes, most likely oxygen optical phonons in STO, which
couple to the FeSe electrons with only small momentum transfer. Such coupling
has the unusual benefit of helping superconductivity in most channels,
including those mediated by spin fluctuations. Our calculations suggest such

pre-cached information from a library of available files. Nodes request files
at random. If the requested file is not in the on-board cache, then it is
downloaded from some neighboring node via one-hop ""local"" communication. An
outage event occurs when a requested file is not found in the neighborhood of
the requesting node, or if the network admission control policy decides not to
serve the request. We characterize the optimal throughput-outage tradeoff in
terms of tight scaling laws for various regimes of the system parameters, when
both the number of nodes and the number of files in the library grow to
infinity. Our analysis is based on Gupta and Kumar {\em protocol model} for the
underlying D2D wireless network, widely used in the literature on capacity
scaling laws of wireless networks without caching. Our results show that the
combination of D2D spectrum reuse and caching at the user nodes yields a
per-user throughput independent of the number of users, for any fixed outage
probability in $(0,1)$. This implies that the D2D caching network is
""scalable"": even though the number of users increases, each user achieves
constant throughput. This behavior is very different from the classical Gupta
and Kumar result on ad-hoc wireless networks, for which the per-user throughput
vanishes as the number of users increases. Furthermore, we show that the user
throughput is directly proportional to the fraction of cached information over
the whole file library size. Therefore, we can conclude that D2D caching
networks can turn ""memory"" into ""bandwidth"" (i.e., doubling the on-board cache
memory on the user devices yields a 100\% increase of the user throughout).

and the multiple-slit interference effect in electron-positron pair production
from vacuum are generalized to vacuum pair production of charged scalar bosons.
For the former effect some combinations of a strong but slowly varying electric
field and a weak but rapidly varying one with different time delay are studied.
Results indicate that the oscillation intensity of momentum spectrum and the
number density of created bosons reduce with increasing of the time delay.
Obviously, they achieve the maximum if the time delay equals zero. For the
latter effect, it is shown that this effect does not exist for equal-sign
$N$-pulse electric field in contrast to its existence for alternating-sign
$N$-pulse. An approximate solution of boson momentum spectrum is got and it is
agreeable well with the exact numerical one in alternating-sign $N$-pulse
electric field, especially for $2$-pulse field and for small longitudinal
momentum. The difference of vacuum pair production between bosons and fermions
are also compared for their longitudinal momentum spectra.

directly related to the problem of \textit{into how many ways can two adjacent
blocks of a lattice be connected}. Answering this question leads to the
generation of a combinatorial set of lattice configurations. This set defines
the \textit{configuration space} of the problem, and the smaller it is, the
faster the transfer matrix method can be. The configuration space of generic
transfer matrix methods for strip lattices in the Potts model is in the order
of the Catalan numbers, leading to an asymptotic cost of $O(4^m)$ with $m$
being the width of the strip. Transfer matrix methods with a smaller
configuration space indeed exist but they make assumptions on the temperature,
number of spin states, or restrict the topology of the lattice in order to
work. In this paper we propose a general and parallel transfer matrix method,
based on family trees, that uses a sub-Catalan configuration space of size
$O(3^m)$. The improvement is achieved by grouping the original set of Catalan
configurations into a forest of family trees, in such a way that the solution
to the problem is now computed by just solving the root node of each family. As
a result, the algorithm becomes exponentially faster and highly parallel. An
additional advantage is that the final matrix ends up being compressed, not
only saving space but also making numerical evaluation on $(q,v)$ faster than
in a non-compressed scenario. Experimental results for different sizes of strip
lattices show that the \textit{Parallel family trees (PFT)} strategy indeed
runs exponentially faster than the \textit{Catalan Parallel Method (CPM)},
specially when dealing with dense transfer matrices. We can confirm that a
parallel implementation of the PFT algorithm is highly effective and efficient
for large problem sizes...

advantage of efficient methods recently developed. Two different ESQPTs are
identified in both models, which are signaled as singularities in the
semi-classical density of states, one {\em static} ESQPT occurs for any
coupling, whereas a dynamic ESQPT is observed only in the superradiant phase.
The role of the unstable fixed points of the Hamiltonian semi-classical flux in

provided that shows that the semi-classical result describes very well the

Therefore the semi-classical density of states can be used to study the

pipelines simply rely on the intuition and prior experience of operators to
make these decisions. Here, we present a new geometric programming approach for
optimizing compressor operation in natural gas pipelines. Using models of real
natural gas pipelines, we show that the geometric programming algorithm
consistently outperforms approaches that mimic existing state of practice.

relevance in today's world that has large streaming data. This process finds
wide scale application in the areas of location tracking, sensor networks,
object positioning and monitoring to name a few. However, as the size of the
data stream increases, the cost involved to retain all the data in order to aid
the process of similarity matching also increases. We develop a novel framework
to addresses the following objectives. Firstly, Dimension reduction is
performed in the preprocessing stage, where large stream data is segmented and
reduced into a compact representation such that it retains all the crucial
information by a technique called Multi-level Segment Means (MSM). This reduces
the space complexity associated with the storage of large time-series data
streams. Secondly, it incorporates effective Similarity Matching technique to
analyze if the new data objects are symmetric to the existing data stream. And
finally, the Pruning Technique that filters out the pseudo data object pairs
and join only the relevant pairs. The computational cost for MSM is O(l*ni) and
the cost for pruning is O(DRF*wsize*d), where DRF is the Dimension Reduction
Factor. We have performed exhaustive experimental trials to show that the
proposed framework is both efficient and competent in comparison with earlier
works.

analysis presented in the previous paper by focusing on the statistical
properties of the quantum fluctuations in the energy spectrum and their
relation with the excited state quantum phase transitions (ESQPT). These
properties are compared with the dynamics observed in the semi-classical
versions of the models. The presence of chaos for different energies and
coupling constants is exhibited, employing Poincar\'e sections and Peres
lattices in the classical and quantum versions, respectively. A clear
correspondence between the classical and quantum result is found for systems
containing between $\mathcal{N} = 80$ to $200$ atoms. A measure of the Wigner
character of the energy spectrum for different couplings and energy intervals
is also presented employing the statistical Anderson-Darling test. It is found
that in the Dicke Model, for any coupling, a low energy regime with regular
states is always present. The richness of the onset of chaos is discussed both
for finite quantum systems and for the semi-classical limit, which is exact

  We propose a new paradigm for detecting silent errors at the application
level. Our central idea is to frequently compare computed values to those
provided by a cheap checking computation, and to build error detectors based on
the difference between the two output sequences. Numerical analysis provides us
with usable checking computations for the solution of initial-value problems in
ODEs and PDEs, arguably the most common problems in computational science.
Here, we provide, optimize, and test methods based on Runge-Kutta and linear
multistep methods for ODEs, and on implicit and explicit finite difference
schemes for PDEs. We take the heat equation and Navier-Stokes equations as
examples. In tests with artificially injected errors, this approach effectively
detects almost all meaningful errors, without significant slowdown.

loci where the average proportion of African ancestry deviates significantly
from the genome-wide average. We failed to find any genome-wide significant
deviations, and conclude that any selection in African Americans since
admixture is sufficiently weak that it falls below the threshold of our power
to detect it using a large sample size. These results stand in contrast to the
findings of a recent study of selection in African Americans. That study, which
had 15 times fewer samples, reported six loci with significant deviations. We
show that the discrepancy is likely due to insufficient correction for multiple
hypothesis testing in the previous study. The same study reported 14 loci that
showed greater population differentiation between African Americans and
Nigerian Yoruba than would be expected in the absence of natural selection.
Four such loci were previously shown to be genome-wide significant and likely
to be affected by selection, but we show that most of the 10 additional loci
are likely to be false positives. Additionally, the most parsimonious
explanation for the loci that have significant evidence of unusual
differentiation in frequency between Nigerians and Africans Americans is
selection in Africa prior to their forced migration to the Americas.

  We observe one South Polar Feature (SPF) on 14 July and three SPFs on 16 July

consistent with the high variability of Neptune's storms.
  There is significant dispersion in Neptune's zonal wind velocities about the
smooth Voyager wind profile fit of Sromovsky et al., Icarus 105, 140 (1993),
much greater than the upper limit we expect from vertical wind shear, with the
largest dispersion seen at equatorial and southern mid-latitudes. Comparison of
feature pressures vs. residuals in zonal velocity from the smooth Voyager wind
profile also directly reveals the dominance of mechanisms over vertical wind
shear in causing dispersion in the zonal winds.
  Vertical wind shear is not the primary cause of the difference in dispersion
and deviation in zonal velocities between features tracked in H-band on 14 July
and those tracked in K'-band on 16 July. Dispersion in the zonal velocities of
features tracked over these short time periods is dominated by one or more
mechanisms, other than vertical wind shear, that can cause changes in the
dispersion and deviation in the zonal velocities on timescales of hours to
days.

It is proposed to divide the absorber into slices in accord with these domains

slices. If the phase shifters are switched on simultaneously at a particular
moment of time, elapsed from the beginning of the step pulse, a strong sharp
pulse is generated at the output of the last slice of the absorber. The effect
is explained by the phasing of the atomic coherence along all slices of the
absorber, which transforms subradiant state of atom-field system to

cellular networks with G cells and K users per cell, having N antennas at each

achievability techniques based on either decomposition with asymptotic
interference alignment (IA) or linear beamforming schemes, and show that there
are distinct regimes of (G,K,M,N) where one outperforms the other. We first
note that both one-sided and two-sided decomposition with asymptotic IA achieve
the same degrees of freedom. We then establish specific antenna configurations
under which the DoF achieved using decomposition based schemes is optimal by
deriving a set of outer bounds on the symmetric DoF. For linear beamforming
schemes, we first focus on small networks and propose a structured approach to
linear beamforming based on a notion called packing ratios. Packing ratio
describes the interference footprint or shadow cast by a set of transmit
beamformers and enables us to identify the underlying structures for aligning
interference. Such a structured beamforming design can be shown to achieve the
optimal spatially normalized DoF (sDoF) of two-cell two-user/cell network and
the two-cell three-user/cell network. For larger networks, we develop an
unstructured approach to linear interference alignment, where transmit
beamformers are designed to satisfy conditions for IA without explicitly
identifying the underlying structures for IA. The main numerical insight of
this paper is that such an approach appears to be capable of achieving the
optimal sDoF for MIMO cellular networks in regimes where linear beamforming
dominates asymptotic decomposition, and a significant portion of sDoF
elsewhere. Remarkably, polynomial identity test appears to play a key role in
identifying the boundary of the achievable sDoF region in the former case.

inverse problem in geophysics. The objective is to estimate the
three-dimensional structure of the earth's interior from data measured at its
surface. Since this typically involves estimating thousands of unknowns or
more, it has always been treated as a linear(ized) optimization problem. Here
we present a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the joint distribution of
earth structural and earthquake source parameters. An ellipsoidal spatial prior
allows to accommodate the layered nature of the earth's mantle. With our
efficient algorithm we can sample the posterior distributions for large-scale
linear inverse problems and provide precise uncertainty quantification in terms
of parameter distributions and credible intervals given the data. We apply the
method to a full-fledged tomography problem, an inversion for upper-mantle
structure under western North America that involves more than 11,000
parameters. In studies on simulated and real data, we show that our approach
retrieves the major structures of the earth's interior as well as classical
least-squares minimization, while additionally providing uncertainty
assessments.

stochastic approximation to the score equations for maximum likelihood
calculation for Gaussian processes. Under certain conditions, including bounded
condition number of the covariance matrix, the approach achieves $O(n)$ storage
and nearly $O(n)$ computational effort per optimization step, where $n$ is the
number of data sites. Here, we prove that if the condition number of the
covariance matrix is bounded, then the approximate score equations are nearly
optimal in a well-defined sense. Therefore, not only is the approximation
efficient to compute, but it also has comparable statistical properties to the
exact maximum likelihood estimates. We discuss a modification of the stochastic
approximation in which design elements of the stochastic terms mimic patterns
from a $2^n$ factorial design. We prove these designs are always at least as
good as the unstructured design, and we demonstrate through simulation that
they can produce a substantial improvement over random designs. Our findings
are validated by numerical experiments on simulated data sets of up to 1
million observations. We apply the approach to fit a space-time model to over
80,000 observations of total column ozone contained in the latitude band

users in a large-scale overlay cognitive radio (CR) network. Two
threshold-based OSA schemes, namely the primary receiver assisted (PRA)
protocol and the primary transmitter assisted (PTA) protocol, are investigated.
Under the PRA/PTA protocol, a secondary transmitter (ST) is allowed to access
the spectrum only when the maximum signal power of the received beacons/pilots
sent from the active primary receivers/transmitters (PRs/PTs) is lower than a
certain threshold. To measure the resulting transmission opportunity for the
secondary users by the proposed OSA protocols, the concept of spatial
opportunity, which is defined as the probability that an arbitrary location in
the primary network is detected as a spatial spectrum hole, is introduced and
then evaluated by applying tools from stochastic geometry. Based on spatial
opportunity, the coverage (non-outage transmission) performance in the overlay
CR network is analyzed. With the obtained results of spatial opportunity and
coverage probability, we finally characterize the spatial throughput, which is
defined as the average spatial density of successful transmissions in the
primary/secondary network, under the PRA and PTA protocols, respectively.

the transition to the diffusion regime. The dependence of the diffusion

accomplish emergent anomalous behaviors. Here, we have grown high quality

lattice mismatch between film and substrates) of films. Surprisingly these two
pathways seek two distinct types of metal insulator transitions; the former
falls into disorder driven Anderson type whereas the latter turns out to be of
unconventional Mott-Anderson type with the interplay of disorder and
correlation. More interestingly, in the metallic phases of SrIrO3, unusual
non-Fermi liquid characteristics emerge in resistivity as the resistivity
exponent evolves from from 4/5 to 1 to 3/2 with increasing lattice strain. We
discuss theoretical implications of these phenomena to shed light on the metal

properties of the solutions of the truncated Dyson-Schwinger equatio for the

In Euclidean space, the quark propagator is not an analytical function
possessing, in general, an infinite number of singularities (poles) which
hamper to solve the Bethe-Salpeter equation. However, for light mesons (with
masses M_{q\bar q} <= 1 GeV) all singularities are located outside the region
within which the Bethe-Salpeter equation is defined. With an increase of the
considered meson masses this region enlarges and already at masses >= 1 GeV,
the poles of propagators of u,d and s quarks fall within the integration domain
of the Bethe-Salpeter equation. Nevertheless, it is established that for meson
masses up to M_{q\bar q}~=3 GeV only the first, mutually complex conjugated,
poles contribute to the solution. We argue that, by knowing the position of the
poles and their residues, a reliable parametrisation of the quark propagators
can be found and used in numerical procedures of solving the Bethe-Salpeter
equation. Our analysis is directly related to the future physics programme at

emission bursts of J1738-2330 exhibit a steady exponential decay of on-pulse
energy accompanied by a flickering emission characterized by short frequent
nulls towards their end. In the bursts of J1752+2359 the flickering is absent,
the decay more pronounced and the energy released during each bright phase is
approximately constant. Unlike J1738-2330, the average profiles for the first
and the last pulses of J1752+2359 bursts differ slightly from the pulsar's
overall profile, hinting at differences between the two pulsars in their
transitions from null to burst state (and vice-versa). During its long null
phases, J1752+2359 is found to emit random weak inter-burst pulses (IBPs) whose
profile peak is somewhat offset with respect to the overall average profile.
Such pulses have no equivalent in J1738-2330 or in any known pulsar hitherto.
They may pervade the entire emission of this pulsar and have a separate
physical origin to normal pulses. On the basis of our comparison we conclude
that a pulsar's nulling fraction, even when high, remains a poor guide to its
detailed subpulse behaviour, as previously found for pulsars with small nulling
fractions.

perfect graphs, we study the Clique-Stable Set Separation in a non-hereditary
subclass of perfect graphs. A cut (B,W) of G (a bipartition of V(G)) separates
a clique K and a stable set S if $K\subseteq B$ and $S\subseteq W$. A
Clique-Stable Set Separator is a family of cuts such that for every clique K,
and for every stable set S disjoint from K, there exists a cut in the family
that separates K and S. Given a class of graphs, the question is to know
whether every graph of the class admits a Clique-Stable Set Separator
containing only polynomially many cuts. It is open for the class of all graphs,
and also for perfect graphs, which was Yannakakis' original question. Here we
investigate on perfect graphs with no balanced skew-partition; the balanced
skew-partition was introduced in the proof of the Strong Perfect Graph Theorem.
Recently, Chudnovsky, Trotignon, Trunck and Vuskovic proved that forbidding
this unfriendly decomposition permits to recursively decompose Berge graphs
using 2-join and complement 2-join until reaching a basic graph, and they found
an efficient combinatorial algorithm to color those graphs. We apply their
decomposition result to prove that perfect graphs with no balanced
skew-partition admit a quadratic-size Clique-Stable Set Separator, by taking
advantage of the good behavior of 2-join with respect to this property. We then
generalize this result and prove that the Strong Erdos-Hajnal property holds in
this class, which means that every such graph has a linear-size biclique or
complement biclique. This property does not hold for all perfect graphs (Fox
2006), and moreover when the Strong Erdos-Hajnal property holds in a hereditary
class of graphs, then both the Erdos-Hajnal property and the polynomial
Clique-Stable Set Separation hold.

hypergraphs and directed circulant hypergraphs. We prove that an even order
circulant B$_0$ tensor is always positive semi-definite. This shows that the

even-uniform hypergraph are positive semi-definite. If a stochastic process is

optical and X-ray, spectral and timing data was that the X-rays are produced in
the innermost hot part of the accretion flow, while the optical/infrared (OIR)
emission is mainly produced by the irradiated outer thin accretion disc. Recent
multiwavelength observations of Galactic black hole transients show that the
situation is not so simple. Fast variability in the OIR band, OIR excesses
above the thermal emission and a complicated interplay between the X-ray and
the OIR light curves imply that the OIR emitting region is much more compact.
One of the popular hypotheses is that the jet contributes to the OIR emission
and even is responsible for the bulk of the X-rays. However, this scenario is
largely ad hoc and is in contradiction with many previously established facts.
Alternatively, the hot accretion flow, known to be consistent with the X-ray
spectral and timing data, is also a viable candidate to produce the OIR
radiation. The hot-flow scenario naturally explains the power-law like OIR
spectra, fast OIR variability and its complex relation to the X-rays if the hot
flow contains non-thermal electrons (even in energetically negligible
quantities), which are required by the presence of the MeV tail in Cyg X-1. The
presence of non-thermal electrons also lowers the equilibrium electron
temperature in the hot flow model to <100 keV, making it more consistent with
observations. Here we argue that any viable model should simultaneously explain
a large set of spectral and timing data and show that the hybrid
(thermal/non-thermal) hot flow model satisfies most of the constraints.

$\alpha$ = $ 0.000662_{- 0.000662}^{+ 0.000173}$ and $\sigma_8$ = $ 0.824_{-
0.0166}^{+ 0.0128}$. The CMB and matter power spectra are both similar for the

curves of $f\sigma_8(z)$ are different. This means that, to some extent, the

properties of hybrid graphite-like structure made up of silicene and boron
nitride (BN) layers. We predict from our calculations that this hybrid bulk
system, with alternate layers of honeycomb silicene and BN, possesses physical
properties similar to those of bulk graphite. We observe that there exists a
weak van der Waals interaction between the layers of this hybrid system in
contrast to the strong inter-layer covalent bonds present in multi-layers of
silicene. Furthermore, our results for the electronic band structure and the
density of states show that it is a semi-metal and the dispersion around the
Fermi level (E_F) is parabolic in nature and thus the charge carriers in this
system behave as \textit{Nearly-Free Particle-Like}. These results indicate
that the electronic properties of the hybrid bulk system resemble closely those
of bulk graphite. Around E_F the electronic band structures have contributions
only from silicene layers and the BN layer act only as a buffer layer in this
hybrid system since it does not contribute to the electronic properties near
E_F. In case of bi-layers of silicene with a single BN layer kept in between,
we observe a linear dispersion around E_F similar to that of graphene. However,
the characteristic linear dispersion become parabola-like when the system is
subjected to a compression along the transverse direction. Our present
calculations show that the hybrid system based on silicon and BN can be a
possible candidate for two dimensional layered system akin to graphite and
multi-layers of graphene.

We reduce the forced complex Ginzburg-Landau equation to the Allen-Cahn
equation near onset, obtaining an asymptotically exact expression for localized

Allen-Cahn equation directly without the intermediate step. We find excellent
agreement between numerical localized solutions of the PDE, localized solutions
of the forced complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, and the Allen-Cahn equation.
This is the first time that a PDE with time dependent forcing has been reduced

negative and $| k |$ is very large, the inverse square potential becomes very

itself such that $\phi(v_i)\phi(v_j)\in E$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $v_i v_j\in E$ for
any two vertices $v_i$ and $v_j$. Denote by $\mathfrak{G}$ the group consisting
of all automorphisms of $G$. Apparently, an automorphism of $G$ can be regarded
as a permutation on $[n]=\{1,\ldots,n\}$, provided that $G$ has $n$ vertices.
For each permutation $\sigma$ on $[n]$, there is a natural action on any given
vector $\boldsymbol{u}=(u_1,\ldots,u_n)^t\in \mathbb{C}^n$ such that
$\sigma\boldsymbol{u}=(u_{\sigma^{-1}1},u_{\sigma^{-1}2},\ldots,u_{\sigma^{-1}

Accordingly, one can formulate a characterization to the automorphisms of $G$,
{\it i.e.,} $\sigma$ is an automorphism of $G$ if and only if every eigenspace
of $\mathbf{A}(G)$ is $\sigma$-invariant, where $\mathbf{A}(G)$ is the
adjacency matrix of $G$. Consequently, every eigenspace of $\mathbf{A}(G)$ is
$\mathfrak{G}$-invariant, which is equivalent to that for any eigenvector
$\boldsymbol{v}$ of $\mathbf{A}(G)$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\lambda$,
$\mathrm{span}(\mathfrak{G}\boldsymbol{v})$ is a subspace of the eigenspace
$V_{\lambda}$. By virtue of the linear representation of the automorphism group
$\mathfrak{G}$, we characterize those extremal vectors $\boldsymbol{v}$ in an
eigenspace of $\mathbf{A}(G)$ so that
$\mathrm{dim}~\mathrm{span}(\mathfrak{G}\boldsymbol{v})$ can attain extremal
values, and furthermore, we determine the exact value of
$\mathrm{dim}~\mathrm{span}(\mathfrak{G}\boldsymbol{v})$ for any eigenvector
$\boldsymbol{v}$ of $\mathbf{A}(G)$.

The contact area will then generally be non-circular, but in many cases it can
reasonably be approximated by an ellipse whose dimensions are determined by
imposing the energy release rate criterion at the ends of the major and minor
axes. Analytical expressions are obtained for the relations between the contact
force, the normal displacement and the ellipse semi-axes. It is found that the
eccentricity of the contact area decreases during tensile loading and for cases
when the point load solution can be accurately described by only one Fourier
term, it is almost circular at pull-off, permitting an exact closed form
solution for this case. As in the isotropic JKR solution, the pull-off force is
independent of the mean elastic modulus, but we find that anisotropy increases
the pull-off force and this effect can be quite significant.

investigated, less is known about the field in activated prominences. We
introduce observational results on the magnetic field structure of an activated
filament in a flaring active region. We study, in particular, its magnetic
structure and line-of-sight flows during its early activated phase, shortly
before it displays signs of rotation. We invert the Stokes profiles of the
chromospheric He I 10830 A triplet and the photospheric Si I 10827 A line
observed in this filament by the VTT on Tenerife. Using these inversion results
we present and interpret the first maps of velocity and magnetic field obtained
in an activated filament, both in the photosphere and the chromosphere. Up to 5
different magnetic components are found in the chromospheric layers of the
filament, while outside the filament a single component is sufficient to
reproduce the observations. Magnetic components displaying an upflow are
preferentially located towards the centre of the filament, while the downflows
are concentrated along its periphery. Also, the upflowing gas is associated
with an opposite-polarity magnetic configuration with respect to the
photosphere, while the downflowing gas is associated with a same-polarity
configuration. The activated filament has a rather complex structure.
Nonetheless, it is compatible with a flux rope, although with a distorted one,
in the normal configuration. The observations are best explained by a rising
flux rope in which a part of the filament material is still stably stored
(upflowing material, rising with the field), while a part is no longer stably
stored and flows down along the field lines.

last few ten years to reduce the flaws of ordinary least squares regression
with regard to prediction accuracy. In this paper, new methods for using
regularized regression in model choice are introduced, and we distinguish the
conditions in which regularized regression develops our ability to discriminate
models. We applied all the five methods that use penalty-based (regularization)
shrinkage to handle Oxazolines and Oxazoles derivatives descriptor dataset with
far more predictors than observations. The lasso, ridge, elasticnet, lars and
relaxed lasso further possess the desirable property that they simultaneously
select relevant predictive descriptors and optimally estimate their effects.
Here, we comparatively evaluate the performance of five regularized linear
regression methods The assessment of the performance of each model by means of
benchmark experiments is an established exercise. Cross-validation and
resampling methods are generally used to arrive point evaluates the
efficiencies which are compared to recognize methods with acceptable features.
Predictive accuracy was evaluated using the root mean squared error (RMSE) and
Square of usual correlation between predictors and observed mean inhibitory
concentration of antitubercular activity (R square). We found that all five
regularized regression models were able to produce feasible models and
efficient capturing the linearity in the data. The elastic net and lars had
similar accuracies as well as lasso and relaxed lasso had similar accuracies
but outperformed ridge regression in terms of the RMSE and R square metrics.

Edwards-Anderson model has produced several rigorous results on the nature of
the spin-glass phase. In particular, it has been shown that, as soon as the
overlap distribution is non-trivial, ultrametricity holds. However, these
theorems are valid only in the thermodynamical limit and are therefore of
uncertain applicability for (perennially off-equilibrium) experimental spin
glasses. In addition, their basic assumption of non-triviality is still hotly
debated. This paper intends to show that the predictions stemming from
ultrametricity are already well satisfied for the lattice sizes where numerical
simulations are possible (i.e., up to $V = 32^3$ spins) and are, therefore,
relevant at experimental scales. To this end we introduce a three-replica
correlation function, which evinces the ultrametric properties of the system
and is shown to scale in the same way as the overlap correlation function.

descriptive study in which we examine coverage by discipline, publisher

this the Thomson Reuters' Subject Categories were aggregated into 15
disciplines. Findings: 30% of the total share of this database belongs to the
fields of Humanities and Social Sciences. Most of the disciplines are covered
by very few publishers mainly from the UK and USA (75.05% of the books), in
fact 33 publishers concentrate 90% of the whole share. Regarding publisher
impact, 80.5% of the books and chapters remained uncited. Two serious errors
were found in this database. Firstly, the Book Citation Index does not retrieve
all citations for books and chapters. Secondly, book citations do not include
citations to their chapters. Research limitations/implications: The Book
Citation Index is still underdeveloped and has serious limitations which call
into caution when using it for bibliometric purposes. Practical implications:
The results obtained from this study warn against the use of this database for
bibliometric purposes, but opens a new window of opportunities for covering
long neglected areas such as Humanities and Social Sciences. The target
audience of this study is librarians, bibliometricians, researchers, scientific
publishers, prospective authors and evaluation agencies. Originality/Value:
There are currently no studies analyzing in depth the coverage of this novel

wrapping D5-branes on a two-cycle inside the conifold. The field theory dual
exhibits confinement and, in addition, a region in which the dynamics is
walking, at least in the weak sense that the running of the coupling is
anomalously slow. We introduce quenched matter in the fundamental, modelled by
probe D7-branes which wrap an internal three-dimensional manifold and lie at
the equator of the transverse two-sphere. In the space spanned by the remaining
internal angle and the radial coordinate the branes admit two embeddings. The
first one is U-shaped: the branes merge at some finite value of the radius. The
second one is disconnected and extends along the entire radial direction at
fixed angular separation. We interpret these two configurations as
corresponding to chiral-symmetry breaking and preserving phases, respectively.
We present a simple diagnostic tool to examine the classical stability of the
embedding, based on the concavity/convexity conditions for the relevant
thermodynamic potentials. We use this criterion to show that U-shaped probes
that explore the walking region are unstable, hence providing a dynamical
origin for the tachyonic mode found in the literature. Whenever this occurs,
the disconnected solution becomes favored energetically. We find that in one of
the two classes of backgrounds the U-shaped embedding is always unstable, and
thus never realised dynamically. Consequently, these models cannot be used to
describe chiral-symmetry breaking. In the second category of solutions, our
analysis reveals the presence of a first-order phase transition between
chiral-symmetry broken and restored phases. Interestingly, this is in the same
class that contains a parametrically light scalar in the spectrum of glueballs
of the dual field theory.

favor a smooth risk variation. The model parameters are estimated using an EM

describe the much higher dilepton rate in $pn$ collisions, in particular
regarding the region $M_{e^+e^-} >$ 0.3 GeV/c$^2$ at beam energies below 2 GeV.
We show that the missing strength can be attributed to the $\rho$-channel
$\pi^+\pi^-$-production, which is dominated by the $t$-channel $\Delta\Delta$
excitation and the recently found isoscalar dibaryonic resonance structure at
2.37 GeV.

usual description in terms of symmetry breaking and local order parameters. The
type or order they feature is of non-local, topological nature, and it allows
such systems to present unusual and interesting behaviours, like robust
degeneracy, and anyonic excitations. Here we focus on the behaviour of such
systems away from equilibrium. After a sudden change of the Hamiltonian - the
so called quantum quench - quantum many body systems show thermalization,
unless the quench is integrable. We show how in topologically ordered systems
out of equilibrium behaviour do not follow the usual thermalization behaviour.

the impact of delays in partner treatment on the expected probability of

previously reported parameter distributions to calculate the probability that
index cases would be re-infected by their untreated partners. We then assumed
different delays between index case and partner treatment to calculate the
probabilities of re-infection. Results: In the absence of partner treatment,
the medians of the expected re-infection probabilities are 19.4% (interquartile
range (IQR) 9.2-31.6%) for chlamydia and 12.5% (IQR 5.6-22.2%) for gonorrhoea.

expected re-infection probabilities are 4.2% (IQR 2.1-6.9%) for chlamydia and
5.5% (IQR 2.6-9.5%) for gonorrhoea. Conclusions: Quicker partner referral and
treatment can substantially reduce re-infection rates for chlamydia and

field effect transistors. Thanks to a buried heating scheme, we drive both a
large thermal bias DT>10K and a strong field-effect modulation of electric
conductance on the nanostructures. This allows the precise mapping of the
evolution of the Seebeck coefficient S as a function of the gate-controlled
conductivity between room temperature and 100K$. Based on these experimental
data a novel estimate of the electron mobility is given. This value is compared
with the result of standard field-effect based mobility estimates and discussed
in relation to the effect of charge traps in the devices.

Input-output relations tend to follow a few regular patterns. For example, many
chemical processes follow the S-shaped Hill equation relation between input
concentrations and output concentrations. That Hill equation pattern
contradicts the fundamental Michaelis-Menten theory of enzyme kinetics. I use
the discrepancy between the expected Michaelis-Menten process of enzyme
kinetics and the widely observed Hill equation pattern of biological systems to
explore the general properties of biological input-output relations. I start
with the various processes that could explain the discrepancy between basic
chemistry and biological pattern. I then expand the analysis to consider
broader aspects that shape biological input-output relations. Key aspects
include the input-output processing by component subsystems and how those
components combine to determine the system's overall input-output relations.
That aggregate structure often imposes strong regularity on underlying
disorder. Aggregation imposes order by dissipating information as it flows
through the components of a system. The dissipation of information may be
evaluated by the analysis of measurement and precision, explaining why certain
common scaling patterns arise so frequently in input-output relations. I
discuss how aggregation, measurement and scale provide a framework for
understanding the relations between pattern and process. The regularity imposed
by those broader structural aspects sets the contours of variation in biology.
Thus, biological design will also tend to follow those contours. Natural
selection may act primarily to modulate system properties within those broad
constraints.

black holes. We compute both thermo-mutual information and the two-point
correlators of large-dimension scalar operators, focussing on the
small-temperature behavior -- an infrared limit with behavior similar to that
seen at large times. The interesting feature of this model is of course that
the entropy density remains finite as $T \rightarrow 0$ while the bulk geometry
develops an infinite throat. This leads to a logarithmic divergence in the
scale required for non-zero mutual information between equal-sized strips in
the two CFTs, though the mutual information between one entire CFT and a
finite-sized strip in the other can remain non-zero even at $T=0$. Furthermore,
despite the infinite throat, there can be extremally charged operators for
which the two-point correlations remain finite as $T \rightarrow 0$. This
suggests an interestingly mixed picture in which some aspects of the
entanglement remain localized on scales set by the chemical potential, while
others shift to larger and larger scales. We also comment on implications for
the localized-quasiparticle picture of entanglement.

between spins that are 10 {\mu}m to 500 {\mu}m apart. The interaction between
spins is dependent on different directions. We can choose the directions on
physical Z, Y and X axis by choosing correlation gradients along those
directions. As an important application, iMQCs can be used for anisotropy
mapping. In the rat brains, we investigate tissue microstructure. We simulated
images expected from rat brains without microstructure. We compare those with
experimental results to prove that the dipolar field from the overall shape
only has small contributions to the experimental iMQC signal. Because of the
underlying low signal to noise ratio (SNR) in iMQCs, this anisotropy mapping
method still has comparatively large potentials to grow. The ultimate goal of
my project is to develop creative and effective methods of tissue
microstructure anisotropy mapping. Recently we found that combining phase data

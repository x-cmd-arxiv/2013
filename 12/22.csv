Hamiltonian approach to Yang-Mills theory are reviewed. Assuming a
quasiparticle picture for the grand canonical gluon ensemble the thermal
equilibrium state is found by minimizing the free energy with respect to the
quasi-gluon energy. The deconfinement phase transition is accompanied by a
drastic change of the infrared exponents of the ghost and gluon propagators.
Above the phase transition the ghost form factor remains infrared divergent but
its infrared exponent is approximately halved. The gluon energy being infrared
divergent in the confined phase becomes infrared finite in the deconfined
phase. Furthermore, the effective potential of the order parameter for
confinement is calculated for SU$(N)$ Yang-Mills theory in the Hamiltonian
approach by compactifying one spatial dimension and using a background gauge
fixing. In the simplest truncation, neglecting the ghost and using the
ultraviolet form of the gluon energy, we recover the Weiss potential. From the
full non-perturbative potential (with the ghost included) we extract a critical
temperature of the deconfinement phase transition of $269$ MeV for the gauge
group SU$(2)$ and $283$ MeV for SU$(3)$.

applications. Spectral methods propose elegant solutions to the problem of
inferring weighted automata from finite samples of variable-length strings
drawn from an unknown target distribution. These methods rely on a singular
value decomposition of a matrix $H_S$, called the Hankel matrix, that records
the frequencies of (some of) the observed strings. The accuracy of the learned
distribution depends both on the quantity of information embedded in $H_S$ and
on the distance between $H_S$ and its mean $H_r$. Existing concentration bounds
seem to indicate that the concentration over $H_r$ gets looser with the size of
$H_r$, suggesting to make a trade-off between the quantity of used information
and the size of $H_r$. We propose new dimension-free concentration bounds for
several variants of Hankel matrices. Experiments demonstrate that these bounds
are tight and that they significantly improve existing bounds. These results
suggest that the concentration rate of the Hankel matrix around its mean does
not constitute an argument for limiting its size.

three dimensions is applied to visualize the stresses inside the packing. The
particle motions below the transition into an arrested packing are found to
produce a well agitated state. At the transition, the particles lose their
energy quite rapidly and form a stress network. With both methods, non-arrested
particles (rattlers) can be identified. In particular, it is found that
rattlers inside the arrested packing can be excited to appreciable dynamics by
the rest-accelerations (g-jitter) during a parabolic flight without destroying
the packings. At low rates of compaction, a regime of slow granular cooling is
identified. The slow cooling extends over several seconds, is described well by
a linear law, and terminates in a rapid final collapse of dynamics before

that functions preserving positivity when applied entrywise to positive
semidefinite matrices of all dimensions are necessarily analytic with
nonnegative Taylor coefficients. When the dimension is fixed, it has been shown
by Vasudeva and Horn that such functions are automatically continuous and
sufficiently differentiable. A natural refinement of the aforementioned problem
consists of characterizing functions preserving positivity under rank
constraints. In this paper, we begin this study by characterizing entrywise
functions which preserve the cone of positive semidefinite real matrices of
rank $1$ with entries in a general interval. Classifying such functions is
intimately connected to the classical problem of solving Cauchy's functional
equations, which have non-measurable solutions. We demonstrate that under mild
local measurability assumptions, such functions are automatically smooth and
can be completely characterized. We then extend our results by classifying
functions preserving positivity on rank $1$ Hermitian complex matrices.

most planets to multiple Jupiter masses. However, known giant planets are
predominantly Jupiter-mass bodies. Obtaining longer timescales for gas
accretion may require using realistic equations of states, or accounting for
the dynamics of the circumplanetary disk (CPD) in low-viscosity regime, or
both. Here we explore the second way using global, three-dimensional isothermal
hydrodynamical simulations with 8 levels of nested grids around the planet. In
our simulations the vertical inflow from the circumstellar disk (CSD) to the
CPD determines the shape of the CPD and its accretion rate. Even without
prescribed viscosity Jupiter's mass-doubling time is $\sim 10^4$ years,
assuming the planet at 5.2 AU and a Minimum Mass Solar Nebula. However, we show
that this high accretion rate is due to resolution-dependent numerical
viscosity. Furthermore, we consider the scenario of a layered CSD, viscous only
in its surface layer, and an inviscid CPD. We identify two planet-accretion
mechanisms that are independent of the viscosity in the CPD: (i) the polar
inflow -- defined as a part of the vertical inflow with a centrifugal radius
smaller than 2 Jupiter-radii and (ii) the torque exerted by the star on the
CPD. In the limit of zero effective viscosity, these two mechanisms would
produce an accretion rate 40 times smaller than in the simulation.

with azo-benzene chromophores were shown to form a new class of hybrid
nanomaterials for optoelectronics applications. Here we use a number of
experimental techniques and theory to understand the binding, orientation, and
nature of coupling between chromophores and the nanotubes, all of which are of
relevance to future optimization of these hybrid materials. We find that the
binding energy between chromophores and nanotubes depends strongly on the type
of tether that is used to bind the chromophores to the nanotubes, with pyrene
tethers resulting in more than 90% of the bound chromophores during processing.
DFT calculations show that the binding energy of the chromophores to the
nanotubes is maximized for chromophores parallel to the nanotube sidewall, even
with the use of tethers; second harmonic generation shows that there is
nonetheless a partial radial orientation of the chromophores on the nanotubes.
We find weak electronic coupling between the chromophores and the SWNTs,
consistent with non-covalent binding. The chromophore-nanotube coupling, while
weak, is sufficient to quench the chromophore fluorescence. Stern-Volmer plots
are non-linear, which supports a combination of static and dynamic quenching
processes. The chromophore orientation is an important variable for
chromophore-nanotube phototransistors, and our experiments suggest the
possibility for further optimizing this orientational degree of freedom.

not as gas-poor as previously thought, and at least 40% of local early-type
galaxies are now known to contain molecular and/or atomic gas. This cold gas
offers the opportunity to study recent galaxy evolution through the processes
of cold gas acquisition, consumption (star formation), and removal. Molecular
and atomic gas detection rates range from 10% to 34% in red sequence early-type
galaxies, depending on how the red sequence is defined, and from 50% to 70% in
blue early-type galaxies. Notably, massive red sequence early-type galaxies
(stellar masses > 5e10 Msun, derived from dynamical models) are found to have
HI masses up to M(HI)/Mstar ~ 0.06 and H_2 masses up to M(H$_2$)/Mstar ~ 0.01.
Some 20% of all massive early-type galaxies may have retained atomic and/or
molecular gas through their transition to the red sequence. However, kinematic
and metallicity signatures of external gas accretion (either from satellite
galaxies or the intergalactic medium) are also common, particularly at stellar
masses <= 5e10 Msun, where such signatures are found in ~ 50% of H$_2$-rich
early-type galaxies. Our data are thus consistent with a scenario in which fast
rotator early-type galaxies are quenched former spiral galaxies which have
undergone some bulge growth processes, and in addition, some of them also
experience cold gas accretion which can initiate a period of modest star
formation activity. We discuss implications for the interpretation of
colour-magnitude diagrams.

viruses to reproduce within eukaryotic hosts. Two different modes of
coinfection have been posited based on experimental observation. In one mode,
the virophage and virus enter the host independently. In the other mode, the
virophage adheres to the virus so both virophage and virus enter the host
together. Here we ask: what are the ecological effects of these different modes
of coinfection? In particular, what ecological effects are common to both
infection modes, and what are the differences particular to each mode? We
develop a pair of biophysically motivated ODE models of viral-host population
dynamics, corresponding to dynamics arising from each mode of infection. We
find both modes of coinfection allow for the coexistence of the virophage,
virus, and host either at a stable fixed point or through cyclical dynamics. In
both models, virophage tend to be the most abundant population and their
presence always reduces the viral abundance and increases the host abundance.
However, we do find qualitative differences between models. For example, via
extensive sampling of biologically relevant parameter space, we only observe
bistability when the virophage and virus enter the host together. We discuss
how such differences may be leveraged to help identify modes of infection in
natural environments from population level data.

properties (Curry-style). Intrinsic theories were introduced in the late 1990s
to provide a purely logical framework for reasoning about programs and their
semantic types. We extend them here to data given by any combination of
inductive and coinductive definitions. This approach is of interest because it
fits tightly with syntactic, semantic, and proof theoretic fundamentals of
formal logic, with potential applications in implicit computational complexity
as well as extraction of programs from proofs. We prove a Canonicity Theorem,
showing that the global definition of program typing, via the usual (Tarskian)
semantics of first-order logic, agrees with their operational semantics in the
intended model. Finally, we show that every intrinsic theory is interpretable
in a conservative extension of first-order arithmetic. This means that
quantification over infinite data objects does not lead, on its own, to
proof-theoretic strength beyond that of Peano Arithmetic. Intrinsic theories
are perfectly amenable to formulas-as-types Curry-Howard morphisms, and were
used to characterize major computational complexity classes Their extensions
described here have similar potential which has already been applied.

detect signatures of a reentrant behavior in the melting of N\'eel phase and
symmetry restoring when the system undergoes a transition from an on-layer

and the $Q\propto\rho_{\rm de}$ model gives rise to the future unphysical
result for cold dark matter density (in the case of a positive coupling). In
order to overcome these fatal flaws, we propose in this paper an interacting

carefully designed to realize that $Q\propto\rho_{\rm de}$ at the early times

concrete form of the interaction term in this model is $Q=3\beta H
\frac{\rho_{\rm{de}}\rho_{\rm{c}}}{\rho_{\rm{de}}+\rho_{\rm{c}}}$, where
$\beta$ is the dimensionless coupling constant. We show that this model is
actually equivalent to the decomposed new generalized Chaplygin gas (NGCG)
model, with the relation $\beta=-\alpha w$. We calculate the cosmological
perturbations in this model in a gauge-invariant way and show that the
cosmological perturbations are stable during the whole expansion history

with other astrophysical data to place stringent constraints on this model
(with eight parameters), and we find that indeed $\beta>0$ is supported by the
joint constraint at more than 1$\sigma$ level. The excellent theoretical
features and the support from observations all indicate that the decomposed
NGCG model deserves more attention and further investigation.

$1-1/(r^4 H)$ for population size $N\to\infty$ and structural parameter
$H\gg1$. This correction resolves the differences between the two

superstars remain capable of eliminating random drift and hence of providing
arbitrarily strong selective advantages to any beneficial mutation. In
addition, we investigate the robustness of amplification in superstars and find
that it appears to be a fragile phenomenon with respect to changes in the
selection or mutation processes.

identification of privileged single spreaders, we summarize several widely used
centralities, such as degree, betweenness centrality, PageRank, k-shell, etc.
We investigate the empirical diffusion data in a large scale online social
community -- LiveJournal. With this extensive dataset, we find that various
measures can convey very distinct information of nodes. Of all the users in
LiveJournal social network, only a small fraction of them involve in spreading.
For the spreading processes in LiveJournal, while degree can locate nodes
participating in information diffusion with higher probability, k-shell is more
effective in finding nodes with large influence. Our results should provide
useful information for designing efficient spreading strategies in reality.

represents the ability of networks to encode external stimuli, is crucial to
many applications. We regard the system as a two-layer network (E-Layer and
I-Layer) and explore the criticality and dynamic range on diverse networks.
Interestingly, we find that phase transition occurs when the dominant
eigenvalue of E-layer's weighted adjacency matrix is exactly one, which is only
determined by the topology of E-Layer. Meanwhile, it is shown that dynamic
range is maximized at critical state. Based on theoretical analysis, we propose
an inhibitory factor for each excitatory node. We suggest that if nodes with
high inhibitory factors are cut out from I-Layer, dynamic range could be
further enhanced. However, because of the sparseness of networks and passive
function of inhibitory nodes, the improvement is relatively small compared
tooriginal dynamic range. Even so, this provides a strategy to enhance dynamic
range.

ATRM is a generalization of the previously developed Two-Regime Method [Flegg
et al, Journal of the Royal Society Interface, 2012] to multiscale problems
which require a dynamic selection of regions where detailed Brownian dynamics
simulation is used. Typical applications include a front propagation or
spatio-temporal oscillations. In this paper, the ATRM is used for an in-depth
study of front propagation in a stochastic reaction-diffusion system which has
its mean-field model given in terms of the Fisher equation [Fisher, Annals of
Eugenics, 1937]. It exhibits a travelling reaction front which is sensitive to
stochastic fluctuations at the leading edge of the wavefront. Previous studies
into stochastic effects on the Fisher wave propagation speed have focused on
lattice-based models, but there has been limited progress using off-lattice
(Brownian dynamics) models, which suffer due to their high computational cost,
particularly at the high molecular numbers that are necessary to approach the
Fisher mean-field model. By modelling only the wavefront itself with the
off-lattice model, it is shown that the ATRM leads to the same Fisher wave
results as purely off-lattice models, but at a fraction of the computational
cost. The error analysis of the ATRM is also presented for a morphogen gradient

resource redistribution efficient regardless of the particular position of

an arbitrary-shaped region in the parameter space. We compute an approximate
p-value by counting how many times the null hypothesis holds in bootstrap
replicates. This frequency, known as bootstrap probability, is widely used in
evolutionary biology, but often reported as biased in the literature. Based on
the asymptotic theory of bootstrap confidence intervals, there have been some
new attempts for adjusting the bias via bootstrap probability without direct
access to the parameter value. One such an attempt is the double bootstrap
which adjusts the bias by bootstrapping the bootstrap probability. Another new
attempt is the multiscale bootstrap which is similar to the m-out-of-n
bootstrap but very unusually extrapolating the bootstrap probability to $m=-n$.
In this paper, we employ these two attempts at the same time, and call the new
procedure as multiscale-double bootstrap. By focusing on the multivariate
normal model, we investigate higher-order asymptotics up to fourth-order
accuracy. Geometry of the region plays important roles in the asymptotic
theory. It was known in the literature that the curvature of the boundary
surface of the region determines the bias of bootstrap probability. We found
out that the curvature-of-curvature determines the remaining bias of double
bootstrap. The multiscale bootstrap removes these biases. The multiscale-double
bootstrap is fourth order accurate with coverage probability erring only
$O(n^{-2})$, and it is robust against computational error of parameter
estimation used for generating bootstrap replicates from the null distribution.

Approximately unbiased tests based on the bootstrap probabilities are
considered in Shimodaira (2004) for the exponential family of distributions
with unknown expectation parameter vector, where the null hypothesis is
represented as an arbitrary-shaped region with smooth boundaries. It has been
described in the lemmas of Shimodaira (2004) that the newly developed
three-step multiscale bootstrap method calculates an asymptotically third-order
accurate $p$-value. All the mathematical proofs of these lemmas are shown here.
The straightforward, though very tedious, calculations involving tensor

expands. We discuss a formalism where the two effects can be unified. The basic
assumption is that the Universe is determined by a unitarily evolving
wavepacket defined on space-time. Space-time is static but the Universe is
dynamic. Spreading analogous to expansion known from observational cosmology is
obtained if one regards time evolution as a discrete process with probabilities
of jumps determined by a variational principle employing
Kolmogorov-Nagumo-R\'enyi averages. The choice of the R\'enyi calculus implies
that the form of the Universe involves an implicit fractal structure. The
formalism automatically leads to two types of ""time"" parameters: $\tau$, with
dimension of $x^0$, and dimensionless $\varepsilon=\ln \epsilon_\tau$, related
to the form of diffeomorphism that defines the dynamics. There is no preferred
time foliation, but effectively the dynamics leads to asymptotic concentration
of the Universe on spacelike surfaces that propagate in space-time. The
analysis is performed explicitly in $1+1$ dimensions, but the unitary evolution
operator is brought to a form that makes generalizations to other dimensions

major trend of malignant transformation can be described as a two-phase
process, where an initial increase of network plasticity is followed by a
decrease of plasticity at late stages of tumor development. The fluctuating
intensity of stress factors, like hypoxia, inflammation and the either
cooperative or hostile interactions of tumor inter-cellular networks, all
increase the adaptation potential of cancer cells. This may lead to the bypass
of cellular senescence, and to the development of cancer stem cells. We propose
that the central tenet of cancer stem cell definition lies exactly in the
indefinability of cancer stem cells. Actual properties of cancer stem cells
depend on the individual ""stress-history"" of the given tumor. Cancer stem cells
are characterized by an extremely large evolvability (i.e. a capacity to
generate heritable phenotypic variation), which corresponds well with the
defining hallmarks of cancer stem cells: the possession of the capacity to
self-renew and to repeatedly re-build the heterogeneous lineages of cancer
cells that comprise a tumor in new environments. Cancer stem cells represent a
cell population, which is adapted to adapt. We argue that the high evolvability
of cancer stem cells is helped by their repeated transitions between plastic
(proliferative, symmetrically dividing) and rigid (quiescent, asymmetrically
dividing, often more invasive) phenotypes having plastic and rigid networks.
Thus, cancer stem cells reverse and replay cancer development multiple times.
We describe network models potentially explaining cancer stem cell-like
behavior. Finally, we propose novel strategies including combination therapies
and multi-target drugs to overcome the Nietzschean dilemma of cancer stem cell
targeting: ""what does not kill me makes me stronger"".

  However, this notion requires additional structure to be present, namely a
fiber functor. For the case of classical Tannakian categories in characteristic
zero, Deligne has found intrinsic properties - expressible entirely within the
language of tensor categories - which are necessary and sufficient for the
existence of a fiber functor. In this paper we generalize Deligne's result to
weakly Tannakian categories in characteristic zero. The class of geometric
objects whose tensor categories of quasi-coherent sheaves can be recognized in
this manner includes both the gerbes arising in classical Tannaka duality and
more classical geometric objects such as projective varieties over a field of

  Our proof uses a different perspective on fiber functors, which we formalize
through the notion of geometric tensor categories. A second application of this

recently to explain the origin of the multiple population phenomenon in
Galactic globular clusters. It envisages the possibility that a fraction of
low- and very low-mass cluster stars may accrete the ejecta of interacting
massive binary (and possibly also fast rotating massive) stars during the fully
convective, pre-main sequence stage, to reproduce the CN and ONa
anticorrelations observed among stars in individual clusters. This scenario is
assumed to be able to explain the presence (and properties) of the multiple
populations in the majority of globular clusters in the Milky Way. Here we have
considered the well studied cluster NGC 2808, which displays a triple main
sequence with well defined and separate He abundances. Knowledge of these
abundances allowed us to put strong constraints on the He mass fraction and
amount of matter to be accreted by low-mass pre-main sequence stars. We find
that the minimum He mass fraction in the accreted gas has to be $\sim0.44$ to
produce the observed sequences and that at fixed initial mass of the accreting
star, different efficiencies for the accretion are required to produce stars
placed onto the multiple main sequences. This may be explained by differences
in the orbital properties of the progenitors and/or different spatial
distribution of intracluster gas with varying He abundances. Both O-Na and C-N
anticorrelations appear naturally along the main sequences, once considering
the predicted relationship between He and CNONa abundances in the ejecta of the
polluters. As a consequence of the accretion, we predict no discontinuity
between the abundance ranges covered by intermediate and blue main sequence
stars, but we find a sizeable (several 0.1 dex) discontinuity of the N and Na
abundances between objects on the intermediate and red main sequences.

lines reported in the literature so far. We have developed and applied
different line searching algorithms, resulting in the discovery of 17 line
candidates. We estimate that the rate of false positive line detections is
~2/17. We identify optical/NIR counterparts from the deep ancillary database of
the HDF-N for seven of these candidates and investigate their available SEDs.
Two secure CO detections in our scan are identified with star-forming galaxies
at z=1.784 and at z=2.047. These galaxies have colors consistent with the `BzK'
color selection and they show relatively bright CO emission compared with
galaxies of similar dust continuum luminosity. We also detect two spectral
lines in the submillimeter galaxy HDF850.1 at z=5.183. We consider an
additional 9 line candidates as high quality. Our observations also provide a
deep 3mm continuum map (1-sigma noise level = 8.6 $\mu$Jy/beam). Via a stacking

discovered at spectral measurements of sub-terahertz electromagnetic emission
from a flux-flow oscillator (FFO) deposited on optically polished Si substrate.
The back action of the acoustic waves generated by the FFO and reflected by the
bottom surface of the Si substrate results in the appearance of resonant steps
in the FFO IVCs with spacing as small as 29 nV for 0.3 mm substrate thickness;
these steps manifest themselves in a pronounced resonant structure in the
emission spectra with spacing of about 14 MHz precisely according to the
Josephson relation. The mechanism of acoustic wave generation and detection by
the FFO is discussed; a possibility for employing the discovered effect for FFO
frequency stabilization has been demonstrated. A simple and reliable way to
suppress the superfine resonant structure has been developed and proven; this
invention allows for continuous frequency tuning and FFO phase locking at any
desired frequency, all of which is vitally important for most applications.

not vanish during the reversal of the solar magnetic field, which occurs in
each solar cycle. In contrast, mean-field solar dynamo models predict that the
dipole field does become zero. In a recent paper Moss et al. (2013) suggested
that this contradiction can be explained as a large-scale manifestation of
small-scale magnetic fluctuations of the surface poloidal field. Here we
compare this interpretation with WSO (Wilcox Solar Observatory) photospheric
magnetic field data in order to determine the amplitude of magnetic
fluctuations required to explain the phenomenon and to compare the results with
predictions from a simple dynamo model which takes these fluctuations into
account. We demonstrate that the WSO data concerning the magnetic dipole
reversals are very similar to the predictions of our very simple solar dynamo
model, which includes both mean magnetic field and fluctuations. The ratio
between the rms value of the magnetic fluctuations and the mean field is
estimated to be about 2, in reasonable agreement with estimates from sunspot
data. The reversal epoch, during which the fluctuating contribution to the
dipole is larger than that from the mean field, is about 4 months. The memory
time of the fluctuations is about 2 months. Observations demonstrate that the
rms of the magnetic fluctuations is strongly modulated by the phase of the
solar cycle. This gives additional support to the concept that the solar
magnetic field is generated by a single dynamo mechanism rather than also by
independent small-scale dynamo action. A suggestion of a weak nonaxsymmetric
magnetic field of a fluctuating nature arises from the analysis, with a
lifetime of about 1 year.

  Aims. Our Herschel Open Time Key Programme DUNES aims at detecting and
characterizing debris disks around nearby, sun-like stars. In addition to the
statistical analysis of the data, the detailed study of single objects through
spatially resolving the disk and detailed modeling of the data is a main goal
of the project.
  Methods. We obtained the first observations spatially resolving the debris
disk around the sun-like star HIP 17439 (HD23484) using the instruments PACS
and SPIRE on board the Herschel Space Observatory. Simultaneous
multi-wavelength modeling of these data together with ancillary data from the
literature is presented.
  Results. A standard single component disk model fails to reproduce the major
axis radial profiles at 70 um, 100 um, and 160 um simultaneously. Moreover, the
best-fit parameters derived from such a model suggest a very broad disk
extending from few au up to few hundreds of au from the star with a nearly
constant surface density which seems physically unlikely. However, the
constraints from both the data and our limited theoretical investigation are
not strong enough to completely rule out this model. An alternative, more
plausible, and better fitting model of the system consists of two rings of dust
at approx. 30 au and 90 au, respectively, while the constraints on the
parameters of this model are weak due to its complexity and intrinsic
degeneracies.
  Conclusions. The disk is probably composed of at least two components with
different spatial locations (but not necessarily detached), while a single,
broad disk is possible, but less likely. The two spatially well-separated rings
of dust in our best-fit model suggest the presence of at least one high mass
planet or several low-mass planets clearing the region between the two rings
from planetesimals and dust.

demonstrate this interplay between quench and topology in models stemming from
two extensively studied systems, the transverse Ising chain and the Kitaev
honeycomb model. Through non-local maps of each of these systems, we
effectively study spinless fermionic $p$-wave paired superconductors. Confining
the systems to ring and toroidal geometries, respectively, enables us to
cleanly address degeneracies, subtle issues of fermion occupation and parity,
and mismatches between topological sectors. We show that various features of
the quench, which are related to Kibble-Zurek physics, are sensitive to the
topological sector being probed, in particular, the overlap between the
time-evolved initial ground state and an appropriate low-energy state of the
final Hamiltonian. While most of our study is confined to translationally
invariant systems, where momentum is a convenient quantum number, we briefly
consider the effect of disorder and illustrate how this can influence the
quench in a qualitatively different way depending on the topological sector
considered.

properties of one of the Mn$_4$ molecular magnets (Mn4(hmp)6), where two types

constants in the GGA+U approximation shows that in contrast to a common belief
the strongest exchange coupling is not between two Mn3+ ions (J_{bb}), but
along two out of four exchange paths connecting Mn3+ and Mn2+ ions (J_{wb}).
The microscopic analysis performed within the perturbation theory allowed to
establish the mechanism for this largest ferromagnetic exchange constant. The
charge ordering of the Mn ions results in the situation when the energy of the
excited state in the exchange process is defined not by the large on-site
Coulomb repulsion U, but by much smaller energy V, which stabilizes the charge
ordered state. Together with strong Hund's rule coupling and specific orbital

manifold is often defined by certain surface integral expressions evaluated
along a foliation of the manifold near infinity, e. g. by Arnowitt, Deser, and
Misner (ADM). There are also what we call 'abstract' definitions of the center
of mass in terms of a foliation near infinity itself, going back to the
constant mean curvature (CMC-) foliation studied by Huisken and Yau; these give
rise to surface integral expressions when equipped with suitable systems of
coordinates. We discuss subtle asymptotic convergence issues regarding the ADM-
and the coordinate expressions related to the CMC-center of mass. In
particular, we give explicit examples demonstrating that both can diverge -- in
a setting where Einstein's equation is satisfied. We also give explicit
examples of the same asymptotic order of decay with prescribed mass and center
of mass. We illustrate both phenomena by providing analogous examples in
Newtonian gravity. Our examples conflict with some results in the literature.

  Distributed Environments","Ph.D. Dissertation. http://eprints-phd.biblio.unitn.it/1124/",,,,"cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  The enforcement of sensitive policies in untrusted environments is still an
open challenge for policy-based systems. On the one hand, taking any
appropriate security decision requires access to these policies. On the other
hand, if such access is allowed in an untrusted environment then confidential
information might be leaked by the policies. The key challenge is how to
enforce sensitive policies and protect content in untrusted environments. In
the context of untrusted environments, we mainly distinguish between outsourced
and distributed environments. The most attractive paradigms concerning
outsourced and distributed environments are cloud computing and opportunistic
networks, respectively.
  In this dissertation, we present the design, technical and implementation
details of our proposed policy-based access control mechanisms for untrusted
environments. First of all, we provide full confidentiality of access policies
in outsourced environments, where service providers do not learn private
information about policies. We support expressive policies and take into
account contextual information. The system entities do not share any encryption
keys. For complex user management, we offer the full-fledged Role-Based Access
Control (RBAC) policies.
  In opportunistic networks, we protect content by specifying expressive
policies. In our proposed approach, brokers match subscriptions against
policies associated with content without compromising privacy of subscribers.
As a result, unauthorised brokers neither gain access to content nor learn
policies and authorised nodes gain access only if they satisfy policies
specified by publishers. Our proposed system provides scalable key management
in which loosely-coupled publishers and subscribers communicate without any
prior contact. Finally, we have developed a prototype of the system that runs
on real smartphones and analysed its performance.

to a single equation. We adopt the assumption of constant Ricci scalar which
maybe zero or non-zero. Moreover, the energy density of the non-trivial

energy-momentum complex in the perspective of f(R) gravity for some appropriate
f(R) model, which turns out to be a constant quantity.

spectrum harmonizes Hawking radiation with black hole (BH) quasi-normal modes

Schwarzschild BHs (SBH) and Kerr BHs (KBH). In this assignment, we generalize
the analysis to the framework of nonextremal Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m BHs (RNBH).
Such a generalization is important because in both SBHs and KBHs an absorbed
(or emitted) particle has only mass. Instead, in RNBHs the particle has charge
as well as mass. In doing so, we expose that for the RNBH, QNMs can be
naturally interpreted in terms of quantum levels for both particle emission and
absorption. Conjointly, we generalize some concepts concerning the RNBH's
""effective states"".

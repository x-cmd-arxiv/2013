we explore the effect of the coefficient, C, characterizing the strength of the
spin-current interaction, on physical properties. We observe that for larger C
values and below a critical temperature, the magnetic moments organize
themselves in a novel cycloid which propagates along a low-symmetry direction
and is associated with a structural phase transition from polar rhombohedral to
a polar triclinic state. We emphasize that both of these magnetic and

different solutions of the spin-current model.

  Technology: Helpful Solution for Rescue Robots",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Two challenges for rescue robots are to detect human beings and to have an
accurate positioning system. In indoor positioning, GPS receivers cannot be
used due to the reflections or attenuation caused by obstacles. To detect human
beings, sensors such as thermal camera, ultrasonic and microphone can be
embedded on the rescue robot. The drawback of these sensors is the detection
range. These sensors have to be in close proximity to the victim in order to
detect it. UWB technology is then very helpful to ensure precise localization
of the rescue robot inside the disaster site and detect human beings.
  We propose a new method to both detect human beings and locate the rescue
robot at the same time. To achieve these goals we optimize the design of UWB
pulses based on B-splines. The spectral effectiveness is optimized so the
symbols are easier to detect and the mitigation with noise is reduced. Our
positioning system performs to locate the rescue robot with an accuracy about 2
centimeters. During some tests we discover that UWB signal characteristics
abruptly change after passing through a human body. Our system uses this
particular signature to detect human body.

nonnegativity constraints, which seek the sparsest nonnegative solutions to
underdetermined linear systems. Recent study indicates that l1-minimization is
efficient for solving some classes of l0-minimization problems. From a
mathematical point of view, however, the understanding of the relationship
between l0- and l1-minimization remains incomplete. In this paper, we further
discuss several theoretical questions associated with these two problems. For
instance, how to completely characterize the uniqueness of least l1-norm
nonnegative solutions to a linear system, and is there any alternative matrix
property that is different from existing ones, and can fully characterize the
uniform recovery of K-sparse nonnegative vectors? We prove that the fundamental
strict complementarity theorem of linear programming can yield a necessary and
sufficient condition for a linear system to have a unique least l1-norm
nonnegative solution. This condition leads naturally to the so-called range
space property (RSP) and the `full-column-rank' property, which altogether
provide a broad understanding of the relationship between l0- and
l1-minimization. Motivated by these results, we introduce the concept of the
`RSP of order K' that turns out to be a full characterization of the uniform
recovery of K-sparse nonnegative vectors. This concept also enables us to
develop certain conditions for the non-uniform recovery of sparse nonnegative
vectors via the so-called weak range space property.

why, in order that the measured asymmetries would be purely odd under

non-analyticities in the Loschmidt echo and zeros for the Loschmidt amplitude

the spectrum of the transfer matrix. Using a density-matrix renormalization
group algorithm applied to these transfer matrices we numerically investigate
the Loschmidt echo and the Fisher zeros for quantum quenches in the XXZ model

integrable and the non-integrable case---where the Loschmidt echo does not show
non-analyticities although the quench leads across an equilibrium phase
transition, and examples where non-analyticities appear for quenches within the
same phase. For a quench to the free fermion point, we analytically show that
the Fisher zeros sensitively depend on the initial state and can lie exactly on

determined by metallicity. However, the fact that GCs with almost the same
metallicity exhibit different HB morphologies demonstrates that at least one
more parameter is needed to explain the HB morphology. It has been suggested
that one of these should be a global parameter that varies from GC to GC, and
the other a non-global parameter that varies within the GC. In this study we
provide empirical evidence corroborating this idea. We used the photometric
catalogs obtained with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) of the Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) and analyse the CMDs of 74 GCs. The HB morphology of our
sample of GCs has been investigated on the basis of the two new parameters L1
and L2 that measure the distance between the RGB and the coolest part of the
HB, and the color extension of the HB, respectively. We find that L1 correlates
with both metallicity and age, whereas L2 most strongly correlates with the
mass of the hosting GC. The range of helium abundance among the stars in a GC,
characterised by Delta Y and associated with the presence of multiple stellar
populations, has been estimated in a few GCs to date. In these GCs we find a
close relationship among Delta Y, GC mass, and L2. We conclude that age and
metallicity are the main global parameters while the range of helium abundance
within a GC is the main non-global parameter defining the HB morphology of
Galactic GCs.

turbulent motions, diffusion can significantly affect the distribution of
elements, in particular helium, in the intracluster medium (ICM). As has been
noted previously, an incorrect assumption about the helium abundance will lead
to an error in the iron abundance determined from X-ray spectroscopy. The
corresponding effect on the temperature measurement is negligibly small. An
incorrectly assumed helium abundance will also lead to a systematic error in
angular distance measurements based on X-ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ)
observations of clusters of galaxies. Its magnitude is further amplified by the
associated error in the metal abundance determination, the impact being larger
at lower ICM temperatures. Overall, a factor of 2-5 error in the helium
abundance will lead to an ~ 10-25 % error in the angular distance.
  We solve the full set of Burgers equations for a multi-component intracluster
plasma to determine the maximal effect of diffusion on the interpretation of
X-ray and microwave observations of clusters of galaxies. For an isothermal
cluster, gravitational sedimentation can lead to up to a factor of ~ 5-10
enhancements of helium and metal abundances in the cluster center on a ~ 3-7
Gyr timescale. In cool-core clusters on the contrary, thermal diffusion can
counteract gravitational sedimentation and effectively remove helium and metals
from the cluster inner core. In either case, a significant, up to ~ 40 %, error
in the metal abundances determined by means of X-ray spectroscopy is possible.
The angular distance determined from X-ray and SZ data can be underestimated by
up to ~ 10-25 %.

other words, we show stability of the one-dimensional localization from the
single-particle to multi-particle systems with an arbitrary large but finite
number of particles and for sufficient weakly interacting models. The proof
uses the multi-scale analysis estimates for multi-particle systems. The common
probability distribution function of the random external potential in the
Anderson model is assumed to be log-H\""older continuous, so the results apply
to a large class of Anderson models.

tolerate? This question was examined by Braverman and Rao (IEEE Trans. Inf.

messages only in fixed and predetermined rounds. We consider a new class of
non-robust protocols for Interactive Communication, which we call adaptive

channel in the sense that both the order of speaking, and the length of the
protocol may vary depending on observed noise.
  We define models that capture adaptive protocols and study upper and lower
bounds on the permissible noise rate in these models. When the length of the
protocol may adaptively change according to the noise, we demonstrate a
protocol that tolerates noise rates up to $1/3$. When the order of speaking may
adaptively change as well, we demonstrate a protocol that tolerates noise rates
up to $2/3$. Hence, adaptivity circumvents an impossibility result of $1/4$ on
the fraction of tolerable noise (Braverman and Rao, 2014).

however, affects the result. Here we propose to use a perturbative approach
(running the simulation twice) to approximately recover the acoustic wave
field, while preserving seismic reciprocity. To test the method we considered a
1D standard solar model. We found that the mode frequencies of the (unstable)
standard solar model are well approximated by the perturbative approach within
$1~\mu$Hz for low-degree modes with frequencies near $3~\mu$Hz. We also show
that the perturbative approach is appropriate for correcting
rotational-frequency kernels. Finally, we comment that the method can be
generalized to wave propagation in 3D magnetized stellar interiors because the
magnetic fields have stabilizing effects on convection.

result is a novel classical limit where $\hbar$ is kept fixed while a
dimensionless mesoscopic parameter, $\lambda\in[0,1]$, goes to zero. Unlike the
standard classical limit, which holds good up to a certain timescale, ours is a
precise limit incorporating true dynamical chaos, no dispersion, an absence of
macroscopic superpositions and a complete recovery of the symplectic geometry
of classical phase space. We develop the formalism, and discover that energy
levels suffer a {\em generic perturbation\/}. Exactly, they become
$E(\lambda^{2}\hbar)$, where $\lambda = 1$ gives the standard prediction. Exact
interpolative eigenstates can be similarly constructed. Unlike the linear case,
these need no longer be orthogonal. A formal solution for the interpolative
dynamics is given, and we exhibit the free particle as one exactly soluble
case. Dispersion is reduced, to vanish at $\lambda = 0$. We conclude by
discussing some possible empirical signatures, and explore the obstructions to

dynamical system taken with mass-action kinetics have the property of reaction
network detailed balance (RNDB) which is achieved by imposing network-related
constraints on the reaction rate constants. Markov chains (whether arising as
models of CRNs or otherwise) have their own notion of detailed balance, imposed
by the network structure of the graph of the transition matrix of the Markov
chain. When considering Markov chains arising from chemical reaction networks
with mass-action kinetics, we will refer to this property as Markov chain
detailed balance (MCDB). Finally, we refer to the stochastic analog of RNDB as
Whittle stochastic detailed balance (WSDB). It is known that RNDB and WSDB are
equivalent. We prove that WSDB and MCDB are also intimately related but are not
equivalent. While RNDB implies MCDB, the converse is not true. The conditions
on rate constants that result in networks with MCDB but without RNDB are
stringent, and thus examples of this phenomenon are rare, a notable exception
is a network whose Markov chain is a birth and death process. We give a new

state solution. The variational approach based on minimization of the mass or
the energy of the ground state solution is developed. The analytical solution
yields the relation between the coupling constant $G_l$ of the self-interaction
and the electron mass as $m_e\simeq 2.3\sqrt{\hbar c/G_l}$. This solution also
leads to a finite `radius' of the electron which is about $1.9\lambda_e$ where
$\lambda_e$ is the Compton length of electron.

  modeling the chain-like bodies dynamics","16 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the paper a novel stochastic algorithm designed to study of chain-like
bodies dynamics is introduced. This algorithm models chain movements induced by
the tension propagation and its main idea relies on the sequentialization of
each movement into a sequence of virtual steps made by chain's segments. In
this spirit, any accepted chain's new position is achieved by a move that is
initiated by a shift of one segment picked randomly according to a
problem-specific probability distribution and then followed by a cascade of
some other segments' position rearrangements. The rearrangement process
terminates when the tension in the chain induced by the initial shift is
released. A considerable gain in the volume of allocated memory is achieved
because the virtual steps lead to new conformations that are very likely to be
acceptable by nature. We validate the algorithm by comparing passage times for
polymer translocation through a pore obtained within this algorithm with their
counterparts reported in the literature. In this paper we focus on a
fluctuating-bond model of self-avoiding polymers on 2D square lattice. Based on
the large data sets received in our simulations we have found that the
transolaction time is distributed according to the Moyal probability
distribution. This novel finding enables us to identify the theoretical form of
various distributions of translocation time reported in literature by
expressing them very accurately with the help of this two-parameter family of
probability distributions

$\ell_2$-based dimensionality reduction methods such as the proper orthogonal

models based on data from a number of bifurcation regimes. These libraries are
then concatenated into an over-complete library, and $\ell_1$ sparse
representation in this library from a few noisy measurements results in correct
identification of the bifurcation regime. This technique provides an objective
and general framework for classifying the bifurcation parameters, and
therefore, the underlying dynamics and stability. After classifying the
bifurcation regime, it is possible to employ a low-dimensional Galerkin model,
only on modes relevant to that bifurcation value. These methods are
demonstrated on the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation using sparse, noisy
measurements. In particular, three noisy measurements are used to accurately
classify and reconstruct the dynamics associated with six distinct bifurcation
regimes; in contrast, classification based on least-squares fitting ($\ell_2$)
fails consistently.

dipole moments, it was widely believed that the ferroelectric-like distortion
cannot occur in metals. Recently, metallic LiOsO3, was discovered to be the
first clear-cut example of an Anderson-Blount ""ferroelectric"" metal, which at
140 K undergoes a ferroelectric-like structural transition similar to
insulating LiNbO3. This is very surprising because the mechanisms for
structural phase transitions are usually quite distinct in metals and
insulators. Through performing first principles calculations, here we reveal
that the local polar distortion in LiOsO3 is solely due to the instability of
the A-site Li atom, in contrast to the LiNbO3 case where the second order
Jahn-Teller effect of the B-site Nb ion also plays an additional role. More
importantly, the ""ferroelectric""-like long range order of the local polar
distortion is found to be due to the predominantly ferroelectric short-range
pair interactions between the local polar modes which are not screened by
conduction electrons. Furthermore, we predict that LiNbO3-type MgReO3 is also a

process in a $GI/GI/n+M$ queue. This one-dimensional diffusion model is able to
produce accurate performance estimates in two overloaded regimes: In the first
regime, the number of servers is large and the mean patience time is comparable
to or longer than the mean service time; in the second regime, the number of
servers can be arbitrary but the mean patience time is much longer than the
mean service time. Using the diffusion model, we obtain Gaussian approximations
for the steady-state queue length and the steady-state virtual waiting time.
Numerical experiments demonstrate that the approximate distributions are
satisfactory for queues in these two regimes.
  To mathematically justify the diffusion model, we formulate the two
overloaded regimes into an asymptotic framework by considering a sequence of
queues. The mean patience time goes to infinity in both asymptotic regimes,
whereas the number of servers approaches infinity in the first regime but does
not change in the second. The OU process is proved to be the diffusion limit
for the queue length processes in both regimes. A crucial tool for proving the
diffusion limit is a functional central limit theorem for the superposition of
time-scaled renewal processes. We prove that the superposition of $n$
independent, identically distributed stationary renewal processes, after being
centered and scaled in both space and time, converges in distribution to a
Brownian motion as $n$ goes to infinity.

perturbations and the tensor-to-scalar ratio in single field slow roll
inflation due to initial conditions imprinted by a fast-roll stage prior to
slow roll. For a wide range of initial inflaton kinetic energy, this stage
lasts only a few e-folds and merges smoothly with slow-roll leading to
non-Bunch-Davies initial conditions for modes that exit the Hubble radius
during slow roll. We describe a program that yields the dynamics in the
fast-roll stage while matching to the slow roll stage independent of the
inflationary potentials. Corrections to the power spectra are encoded in a
transfer function $\mathcal{T}_\alpha(k)$. We obtain $\mathcal{T}_\alpha(k)$ to
leading order in a Born approximation valid for modes of observational
relevance today. A fit yields $\mathcal{T}_\alpha(k) =1+
A_{\alpha}k^{-p}\cos[2\pi \omega k/H_{sr}+\varphi_\alpha]$, with $1.5 \lesssim
p \lesssim 2$, $\omega \simeq 1$ and $H_{sr}$ the Hubble scale during slow roll
inflation, where curvature and tensor perturbations feature the same $p,\omega$
for a wide range of initial conditions. These corrections lead to both a
suppression of the quadrupole and oscillatory features in both $P_R(k)$ and
$r(k_0)$ with a period of the order of the Hubble scale during slow roll
inflation. The results are independent of the specific inflationary potentials,
depending solely on the ratio of kinetic to potential energy $\kappa$ and the
slow roll parameters to leading order. For a wide range of $\kappa$ and the
values of $\epsilon_V;\eta_V$ corresponding to the upper bounds from Planck, we
find that the low quadrupole is consistent with the results from Planck, and
the oscillations in $r(k_0)$ could be observable if the modes corresponding to
the quadrupole and the pivot scale crossed the Hubble radius a few e-folds

spectra of many extragalactic jets and relate this to the spin of the
supermassive black holes that presumably power them. Pion decay via
proton-proton collisions is a possible mechanism to supply a secondary positron
population with a low energy limit. We expect that pion production would occur
in advection dominated accretion flows or ADAFs. In radiatively inefficient
ADAFs the heat energy of the accreting gas is unable to radiate in less than
the accretion time and the particle temperature could be high enough so that
thermal protons can yield such pion production. Strong starbursts are another
option for the injection of a truncated particle population into the jet. The
role of both mechanisms is discussed with respect to the black hole spin
estimate. The energy demanded to produce the pion decay process involves a
minimum threshold for kinetic energy of the interacting protons. Therefore the
mean proton speed in the flow can determine whether a LEC is generated. In
ADAFs the random velocity of the protons can exceed the minimum speed limit of
pion production around the jet launching region in the innermost part of the
flow. Finally we summarize the additional work needed to put the model
assumptions on a more rigorous basis.

modulational instability of small-scale drift/Rossby waves tend to subsequently

calculated the Higgs pair production rate and investigated the potential of its
discovery at the LHC14. We conclude that: (i) Under current constrains
including Higgs data after Run I of the LHC, the cross section of Higgs pair
production in the Manohar-Wise model can be enhanced up to even $10^3$ times

contributions of the CP-odd color-octet scalar $S^A_I$. For lighter scalar
$S^A_I$ and larger values of $|\lambda_I|$, the cross section of Higgs pair
production can be much larger. (iii) After running again of LHC at 14 TeV, most
of the parameter spaces in the Manohar-Wise model can be test. For an
integrated luminosity of 100 fb$^{-1}$ at the LHC14, when the normalized ratio
$R=10$, the process of Higgs pair production can be detected.

detection of many-body states has recently brought collective quantum phenomena
of many identical particles into the spotlight. This tutorial introduces the
physics of many-boson and many-fermion interference required for the
description of current experiments and for the understanding of novel
approaches to quantum computing.
  The field is motivated via the two-particle case, for which the uncorrelated,
classical dynamics of distinguishable particles is compared to the quantum
behaviour of identical bosons and fermions. Bunching of bosons is opposed to
anti-bunching of fermions, while both species constitute equivalent sources of
bipartite two-level entanglement. The realms of indistinguishable and
distinguishable particles are connected by a monotonic transition, on a scale
defined by the coherence length of the interfering particles.
  As we move to larger systems, any attempt to understand many particles via
the two-particle paradigm fails: In contrast to two-particle bunching and
anti-bunching, the very same signatures can be exhibited by bosons and
fermions, and coherent effects dominate over statistical behaviour. The
simulation of many-boson interference, termed Boson-Sampling, entails a
qualitatively superior computational complexity when compared to fermions. The
hierarchy between bosons and fermions also characterises multipartite
entanglement generation, for which bosons again clearly outmatch fermions.
Finally, the quantum-to-classical transition between many indistinguishable and
many distinguishable particles features non-monotonic structures. While the
same physical principles govern small and large systems, the deployment of the
intrinsic complexity of collective many-body interference makes more particles
behave differently.

imply that an optimal value $U^\ast$ of the Hubbard parameter could be
determined, which ensures that the HSE+$U^\ast$ calculation reproduces the
experimental band gap. It is shown that an improved description not only of the
electronic structure but also of the crystal structure and energetics is
obtained by adding the $U^\ast$ term to the HSE functional, proving the utility
of HSE+$U^\ast$ approach in modeling semiconductors with localized electronic

detailed spectroscopic information is experimentally available. Although
microscopic-macroscopic and self-consistent models have achieved great success

  By using fine-tuned parametrizations of the energy density functionals, the
present work aims at an improved description of the single-particle properties
and rotational bands in the nobelium region. Such locally optimized
parameterizations may have better properties when extrapolating towards the
superheavy region.
  Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov and Lipkin-Nogami methods were used to
calculate the quasiparticle energies and rotational bands of nuclei in the
nobelium region. Starting from the most recent Skyrme parametrization, UNEDF1,
the spin-orbit coupling constants and pairing strengths have been tuned, so as
to achieve a better agreement with the excitation spectra and odd-even mass
differences in $^{251}$Cf and $^{249}$Bk.
  The quasiparticle properties of $^{251}$Cf and $^{249}$Bk were very well
reproduced. At the same time, crucial deformed neutron and proton shell gaps
open up at $N=152$ and $Z=100$, respectively. Rotational bands in Fm, No, and
Rf isotopes, where experimental data are available, were also fairly well
described. To help future improvements towards a more precise description,
small deficiencies of the approach were carefully identified.
  In the $Z\approx100$ mass region, larger spin-orbit strengths than those from
global adjustments lead to improved agreement with data. Puzzling effects of
particle-number restoration on the calculated moment of inertia, at odds with
the experimental behaviour, require further scrutiny.

(EHBL) challenges the standard emission models of blazars. Among the possible
solutions, the so-called hadronic cascade scenario assumes that the observed
high-energy radiation is produced in the intergalactic space through
photo-hadronic reactions by ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) with energies
up to $10^{19-20}$ eV beamed by the blazar jet. Under the assumption --
implicit in this model -- that the intrinsic high-energy synchrotron-self
Compton emission of the blazar does not substantially contribute to the
observed $\gamma$-ray spectrum, we derive constraints to the basic physical
quantities of the jet and we compare them with the requirements of the hadronic
cascade scenario. We found that, for a plausible range of relativistic jet
Doppler factors ($\delta=10-50$), the maximum achievable energy of the
accelerated protons can exceed $2\times 10^{19}$ eV with jet powers of the
order of $\approx 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, parameters compatible with the
requests of the hadronic scenario even if EHBL are embedded in magnetic fields
of cosmic filaments. We also discuss the consequences of our results for the
possibility that local EHBL contribute to the observed UHECR.

anti-symmetric (odd exponent) components of the power series representation of
the G-B formulation along a circular path containing the 4 hypothetical
zero-points predicted by HADAMARD and DE LA VALLEE POUSSIN (H/DLVP 'outlying'

interesting logical consequences are derived and briefly discussed in the

possibility of existence of such outlying zero-points.

the appearance of extreme events close to the integrable limit. In the latter

conditions for self-gravitating defects which generalize the standard matching
conditions. The reasoning for this study is the need for consistency of the
various codimension defects and the existence of a meaningful equation of
motion at the probe limit, things that seem to lack from the standard approach.
These matching conditions arise by varying the brane-bulk action with respect
to the brane embedding fields (and not with respect to the bulk metric at the
brane position) in a way that takes into account the gravitational
back-reaction of the brane to the bulk. They always possess a Nambu-Goto probe
limit and any codimension defect is seemingly consistent for any second order
bulk gravity theory. Here, we consider in detail the case of a codimension-1
brane in five-dimensional Einstein gravity, derive the generic alternative
junction conditions and find the Z_{2}-symmetric braneworld cosmology, as well
as its bulk extension. Compared to the standard braneworld cosmology, the new
one has an extra integration constant which accounts for the today matter and
dark energy contents, therefore, there is more freedom for accommodating the
observed cosmic features. One branch of the solution possesses the asymptotic
linearized LFRW regime. We have constrained the parameters so that to have a
recent passage from a long deceleration era to a small today acceleration epoch
and we have computed the age of the universe, consistent with current data, and
the time-varying dark energy equation of state. For a range of the parameters
it is possible for the presented cosmology to provide a large acceleration in
the high energy regime.

understanding of how planets form, and how their orbits evolve as they form.
Among the various processes that may account for this diversity, the
gravitational interaction between planets and their parent protoplanetary disc
plays a prominent role in shaping young planetary systems. Planet-disc forces
are large, and the characteristic times for the evolution of planets orbital
elements are much shorter than the lifetime of protoplanetary discs. The
determination of such forces is challenging, because it involves many physical
mechanisms and it requires a detailed knowledge of the disc structure. Yet, the
intense research of the past few years, with the exploration of many new
avenues, represents a very significant improvement on the state of the

quantum mechanics. However, when identical particles are condensed in a single
spatial mode, the standard notions of entanglement, based on clearly
identifiable subsystems, break down. This has led many to conclude that such
systems have limited value for quantum information tasks, compared to
distinguishable particle systems. To the contrary, we show that any
entanglement formally appearing amongst the identical particles, including
entanglement due purely to symmetrization, can be extracted into an entangled
state of independent modes, which can then be applied to any task. In fact, the
entanglement of the mode system is in one-to-one correspondence with the
entanglement between the inaccessible identical particles. This settles the
long-standing debate about the resource capabilities of such states, in
particular spin-squeezed states of Bose-Einstein condensates, while also
revealing a new perspective on how and when entanglement is generated in
passive optical networks. Our results thus reveal new fundamental connections
between entanglement, squeezing, and indistinguishability.

applied to several volumes deriving $\Delta {E}_\text{reor}$ for more than
90.000 collinear spin structures for each volume. A variety of structures with
promisingly low $\Delta {E}_\text{reor}$ were tetragonally distorted according
to a two-dimensional mesh defined by volume per atom and $c/a$ ratio of the

that in the absence of motors, filopodia growth is overestimated by the
continuum mean-field theory. Thus fluctuations slow down the growth, especially
when the protrusions are driven by a small number (10 or less) of F-actin
fibres, and when the force opposing growth (coming from membrane elasticity) is
large enough. We also show that, with typical parameter values for eukaryotic
cells, motors are unlikely to provide an actin transport mechanism which
enhances filopodial size significantly, unless the G-actin concentration within
the filopodium greatly exceeds that of the cytosol bulk. We explain these
observations in terms of order-of-magnitude estimates of diffusion-induced and
advection-induced growth of a bundle of Brownian ratchets.

enables us to tune the frequency range of modulation, whereby we can obtain the

that the SZE can set limits on the photon decay time and mass, or on $E^* =
\frac{t_0}{\tau_\gamma}m_\gamma c^2$, that are stronger than those obtained
from the CMB: the main constraints come from the low frequency range $\nu
\approx 10-50$ GHz where the modified SZE $\Delta I_{mod}$ is larger than the
standard one $\Delta I$, with the difference $|(\Delta I_{mod} - \Delta I)|$
increasing with the frequency for increasing values of $E^*$; additional
constraints can be set in the range $120 - 180$ GHz where there is an increase
of the frequency position of the minimum of $\Delta I_{mod}$ with respect to
the standard one with increasing values of $E^*$. We demonstrated that the

asteroid 4179 Toutatis at a closest distance of 770 $\pm$ 120 meters from the
asteroid's surface. The highest-resolution image, with a resolution of better
than 3 meters, reveals new discoveries on the asteroid, e.g., a giant basin at
the big end, a sharply perpendicular silhouette near the neck region, and
direct evidence of boulders and regolith, which suggests that Toutatis may bear
a rubble-pile structure. Toutatis' maximum physical length and width are (4.75
$\times$ 1.95 km) $\pm$10$\%$, respectively, and the direction of the +$z$ axis
is estimated to be (250$\pm$5$^\circ$, 63$\pm$5$^\circ$) with respect to the
J2000 ecliptic coordinate system. The bifurcated configuration is indicative of
a contact binary origin for Toutatis, which is composed of two lobes (head and
body). Chang'e-2 observations have significantly improved our understanding of
the characteristics, formation, and evolution of asteroids in general.

technique can be used for the detection of high-energy-neutrino induced

a particle cascade, also referred to as a particle shower, moving at
approximately the speed of light. Passing through, the cascade will ionize the
medium, leaving behind a plasma tube. The different properties of the
plasma-tube, such as its lifetime, size and the charge-density will be used to
obtain an estimate if it is possible to detect this tube by means of the radar

mobile protons induced by the particle cascade is discussed. An energy
threshold for the cascade inducing particle of 4 PeV for the electron plasma,
and 20 PeV for the proton plasma is obtained. This allows the radar detection
technique, if successful, to cover the energy-gap between several PeV and a few
EeV in the currently operating neutrino detectors, where on the low side
IceCube runs out of events, and on the high side the Askaryan radio detectors
begin to have large effective volumes.

independently, it is only during the last decade that significant efforts are
being made to bring the separate pieces together. Building on previous work
that combined analytical solutions and numerical simulations, we apply a
sophisticated cooling function to incorporate optically thin energy losses in
the dynamics. On the one hand, this allows a self-consistent treatment of the
jet evolution and on the other, it provides the necessary data to generate
synthetic emission maps. Firstly, analytical disk and stellar outflow solutions
are properly combined to initialize numerical two-component jet models inside
the computational box. Secondly, magneto-hydrodynamical simulations are
performed in 2.5D, following properly the ionization and recombination of a
maximum of $29$ ions. Finally, the outputs are post-processed to produce
artificial observational data. The first two-component jet simulations, based
on analytical models, that include ionization and optically thin radiation
losses demonstrate promising results for modeling specific young stellar object
outflows. The generation of synthetic emission maps provides the link to
observations, as well as the necessary feedback for the further improvement of

peculiar irregularities in various thermodynamic quantities found at chemical
freeze-out. The most remarkable irregularity is an unprecedented jump of the
number of effective degrees of freedom observed in this narrow energy range
which is seen in all realistic versions of the hadron resonance gas model.
Therefore, the developed concept is called the non-smooth chemical freeze-out.
We are arguing that these irregularities evidence for the possible formation of
quark gluon bags. In order to develop other possible signals of their formation
here we study the apparent width of wide hadronic resonances and quark gluon
bags in a thermal environment. Two new effects generated for the wide
resonances and quark gluon bags by a thermal medium are discussed here: the
near threshold thermal resonance enhancement and the near threshold thermal
resonance sharpening. On the basis of the new effects we argue that the most
optimistic chance to find experimentally the quark gluon bags may be related to
their sharpening and enhancement in a thermal medium. In this case the wide
quark gluon bags may appear directly or in decays as narrow resonances that are
absent in the tables of elementary particles and that have the apparent width

massive and spherical nucleus with an additional dark matter halo component was
used, to distinguish between the regular and chaotic character of orbits of
stars that move in the meridional plane (R,z). We investigated two different
cases: (i) a flat-disk galaxy (ii) an elliptical galaxy. It is of particular
interest to reveal how the portion of the dark matter inside the main body of
the galaxy influences the ordered or chaotic nature of motion. Varying the
ratio of dark matter to stellar mass, we monitored the evolution not only of
the percentage of chaotic orbits, but also of the percentages of orbits that
compose the main regular resonant families, by classifying regular orbits into
different families. Moreover we tried, to reveal how the starting position of
the parent periodic orbits of each regular family changes with respect to the
fractional portion of dark matter. We compared our results with previous
similar work.

a persistent inversion from n- to p-type in a 200-nm-thick surface layer of a
germanium wafer by illumination with white and blue light. We induce the
inversion with a half-life of ~12 hours at a temperature of 220 K which
disappears above 280 K. The photo-induced inversion is absent for a sample with
a 20-nm-thick gold capping layer providing a Schottky barrier at the interface.
This indicates that charge accumulation at the surface is essential to explain
the observed inversion. The contactless change of carrier concentration is
potentially interesting for device applications in opto-electronics where the
gate electrode and gate oxide could be replaced by the semiconductor surface.

a joint unique decoding of messages of interest along with a subset of messages

achievable region which is, in general, larger than if the receiver treats all

indirect or non-unique decoding where the receiver uses the codebook structure
of the messages to uniquely decode only its messages of interest. Non-unique
decoding has since been used in various scenarios.
  The main result in this paper is to provide an interpretation and a
systematic proof technique for why non-unique decoding, in all known cases

in logic can find the concept of paraconsistency to be suspicious or misguided,
if not actually wrong. The problem is that although they usually have much in
common with more familiar logics (such as intuitionistic or classical logic),
paraconsistent logics necessarily disagree in other parts of the logical
terrain which one might have thought were not up for debate. Thus, one's
logical intuitions may need to be recalibrated to work skillfully with
paraconsistency. To get started, one should clearly appreciate the possibility
of paraconsistent logics and the genuineness of the distinctions to which
paraconsistency points. For this purpose, one typically encounters matrices
involving more than two truth values to characterize suitable consequence
relations. In the eyes of a two-valued skeptic, such an approach might seem
dubious. Even a non-skeptic might wonder if there's another way. To this end,
to explore the basic notions of paraconsistent logic with the assistance of
automated reasoning techniques. Such an approach has merit because by
delegating some of the logical work to a machine, one's logical ""biases"" become
externalized. The result is a new way to appreciate that the distinctions to
which paraconsistent logic points are indeed genuine. Our approach can even
suggest new questions and problems for the paraconsistent logic community.

produce correlated synchronous spikes during behavior and cognition. We
recently developed a method for estimating the dynamics of correlated ensemble
activity by combining a model of simultaneous neuronal interactions (e.g., a
spin-glass model) with a state-space method (Shimazaki et al. 2012 PLoS Comput
Biol 8 e1002385). This method allows us to estimate stimulus-evoked dynamics of
neuronal interactions which is reproducible in repeated trials under identical
experimental conditions. However, the method may not be suitable for detecting
stimulus responses if the neuronal dynamics exhibits significant variability
across trials. In addition, the previous model does not include effects of past
spiking activity of the neurons on the current state of ensemble activity. In
this study, we develop a parametric method for simultaneously estimating the
stimulus and spike-history effects on the ensemble activity from single-trial
data even if the neurons exhibit dynamics that is largely unrelated to these
effects. For this goal, we model ensemble neuronal activity as a latent process
and include the stimulus and spike-history effects as exogenous inputs to the
latent process. We develop an expectation-maximization algorithm that
simultaneously achieves estimation of the latent process, stimulus responses,
and spike-history effects. The proposed method is useful to analyze an
interaction of internal cortical states and sensory evoked activity.

limited to cases where such joint measurements are available. The second error
measure quantifies the differences between two probability distributions
obtained in separate runs of measurements and is of unrestricted applicability.

calculus, the trace of a non-central Wishart random matrix is represented as
the convolution of the trace of its central component and of a formal variable
involving traces of its non-centrality matrix. Thanks to this representation,
the moments of this random matrix are proved to be a Sheffer polynomial
sequence, allowing us to recover several properties. The multivariate symbolic
method generalizes the employment of Sheffer representation and a closed form
formula for computing joint moments and cumulants (also normalized) is given.
By using this closed form formula and a combinatorial device, known in the
literature as necklace, an efficient algorithm for their computations is set
up. Applications are given to the computation of permanents as well as to the
characterization of inherited estimators of cumulants, which turn useful in
dealing with minors of non-central Wishart random matrices. An asymptotic
approximation of generalized moments involving free probability is proposed.

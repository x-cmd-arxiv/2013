"1312.6397","Peter Hoff","Peter David Hoff","Equivariant and scale-free Tucker decomposition models",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Analyses of array-valued datasets often involve reduced-rank array
approximations, typically obtained via least-squares or truncations of array
decompositions. However, least-squares approximations tend to be noisy in
high-dimensional settings, and may not be appropriate for arrays that include
discrete or ordinal measurements. This article develops methodology to obtain
low-rank model-based representations of continuous, discrete and ordinal data
arrays. The model is based on a parameterization of the mean array as a
multilinear product of a reduced-rank core array and a set of index-specific
orthogonal eigenvector matrices. It is shown how orthogonally equivariant
parameter estimates can be obtained from Bayesian procedures under invariant
prior distributions. Additionally, priors on the core array are developed that
act as regularizers, leading to improved inference over the standard
least-squares estimator, and providing robustness to misspecification of the
array rank. This model-based approach is extended to accommodate discrete or
ordinal data arrays using a semiparametric transformation model. The resulting
low-rank representation is scale-free, in the sense that it is invariant to
monotonic transformations of the data array. In an example analysis of a
multivariate discrete network dataset, this scale-free approach provides a more
complete description of data patterns.

number of symmetries, in particular, invariance under rotation, as well as
invariance under exchange of components, parity, or chirality. In this note, I
investigate the class of correlation functions that can be generated by
classical composite physical systems when we restrict attention to systems
which reproduce the certainty relations exactly, and for which the rotational
invariance of the correlation function is the manifestation of rotational
invariance of the underlying classical physics. I call such correlation
functions classical EPR-B correlations. It turns out that the other three

functions in a concise analytic way. We survey open problems, and we show that
the widespread idea that ""quantum correlations are more extreme than classical

gravity-related spontaneous wave function collapse of massive degrees of
freedom. The decoherence effects of the collapses are in principle detectable
if not masked by the overwhelming environmental decoherence. But the DP (or any
other, like GRW, CSL) spontaneous collapses are not detectable themselves, they
are merely the redundant formalism of spontaneous decoherence. To let DP
collapses become testable physics, recently we extended the DP model and
proposed that DP collapses are responsible for the emergence of the Newton
gravitational force between massive objects. We identified the collapse rate,
possibly of the order of 1/ms, with the rate of emergence of the Newton force.
A simple heuristic emergence (delay) time was added to the Newton law of
gravity. This non-relativistic delay is in peaceful coexistence with Einstein's
relativistic theory of gravitation, at least no experimental evidence has so
far surfaced against it. We derive new predictions of such a `lazy' Newton law
that will enable decisive laboratory tests with available technologies. The
simple equation of 'lazy' Newton law deserves theoretical and experimental
studies in itself, independently of the underlying quantum foundational
considerations.

numerical codes that include a proton-electron mass ratio as a fundamental

used to delineate the physical characteristics of ion acoustic travelling waves

opaque if a passive attacker can never tell whether the observed behavior is a

where the set of observable events changes over time depending on the history
of the trace, we consider Orwellian partial observability where unobservable

gas. They define its dissipative dynamics and influence its experimentally
measurable elliptic flow. Due to difficulty of this calculation the relaxation
time approximation (RTA) was used in previous works. As those results have
approached the realistic ones, there is a need to find out how accurate the RTA
is. For this sake we calculate the viscosities in the RTA using cross sections
extracted from the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD) model
and compare them with the same ones calculated without the RTA. This allows us
to find the estimates of errors due to the application of RTA in the
calculations of the viscosities, which are valid also for other similar models.
For instance, in the temperature region $100 MeV \lesssim T \lesssim 160 MeV$
at zero chemical potentials the shear viscosity becomes smaller up to $1.57$
times, or up to $1.45$ times if the averaged relaxation time is used. This has
important consequences for interpretation of the previously made calculations
of the viscosities and some other related calculations. Within the RTA, we also
find estimation of the enhancement of the bulk viscosity of the hadron gas
because of nonconservation of particle numbers. This is a little more extended
version in compare to the published paper, where we were limited in paper's
size and time.

empirical loss without considering the input space. Then splitting rules which
preserve the found clusters as much as possible are determined by casting the
problem into a classification problem. Consequently, our new node splitting
method enjoys more freedom in choosing the splitting rules, resulting in more
efficient tree structures. In addition to the Euclidean target space, we
present a variant which can naturally deal with a circular target space by the
proper use of circular statistics. We apply the regression forest employing our
node splitting to head pose estimation (Euclidean target space) and car
direction estimation (circular target space) and demonstrate that the proposed
method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods (38.5% and 22.5%

essential boundedness of potential functions associated with the i-cSMC

ergodicity of the i-cSMC Markov chain, as well as quantitative bounds on its
(uniformly geometric) rate of convergence. Furthermore, we show that the i-cSMC
Markov chain cannot even be geometrically ergodic if this essential boundedness
does not hold in many applications of interest. Our sufficiency and
quantitative bounds rely on a novel non-asymptotic analysis of the expectation
of a standard normalizing constant estimate with respect to a ""doubly
conditional"" SMC algorithm. In addition, our results for i-cSMC imply that the
rate of convergence can be improved arbitrarily by increasing N, the number of
particles in the algorithm, and that in the presence of mixing assumptions, the
rate of convergence can be kept constant by increasing N linearly with the time
horizon. We translate the sufficiency of the boundedness condition for i-cSMC
into sufficient conditions for the particle Gibbs Markov chain to be
geometrically ergodic and quantitative bounds on its geometric rate of
convergence, which imply convergence of properties of the particle Gibbs Markov
chain to those of its corresponding Gibbs sampler. These results complement
recently discovered, and related, conditions for the particle marginal

the potential to propel systematics in new and exciting directions, but
selecting appropriate markers and methods is not straightforward. We applied
two approaches with particular promise for systematics, restriction site
associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq) and sequence capture (Seq-cap) of
ultraconserved elements (UCEs), to the same set of samples from a non-model,
Neotropical bird. We found that both RAD-Seq and Seq-cap produced genomic
datasets containing thousands of loci and SNPs and that the inferred population
assignments and species trees were concordant between datasets. However,
model-based estimates of demographic parameters differed between datasets,
particularly when we estimated the parameters using a method based on allele
frequency spectra. The differences we observed may result from differences in
assembly, alignment, and filtering of sequence data between methods, and our
findings suggest that caution is warranted when using allele frequencies to
estimate parameters from low-coverage sequencing data. We further explored the
differences between methods using simulated Seq-cap- and RAD-Seq-like datasets.
Analyses of simulated data suggest that increasing the number of loci from 500
to 5000 increased phylogenetic concordance factors and the accuracy and
precision of demographic parameter estimates, but increasing the number of loci
past 5000 resulted in minimal gains. Increasing locus length from 64 bp to 500
bp improved phylogenetic concordance factors and minimal gains were observed
with loci longer than 500 bp, but locus length did not influence the accuracy
and precision of demographic parameter estimates. We discuss our results
relative to the diversity of data collection methods available, and we provide
advice for harnessing next-generation sequencing for systematics research.

element implementation for performing concurrent multiple sub-domain
simulations in linear structural dynamics. Using this approach one can solve
problems in which the domain under analysis can be selectively discretized
spatially and temporally, hence allowing the user to obtain a desired level of
accuracy in critical regions while improving computational efficiency globally.
The mathematical background for this approach is largely based upon the
fundamental principles of domain decomposition methods (DDM) and Lagrange
multipliers, used to obtain coupled equations of motion for distinct regions of
a continuous domain. These methods when combined together systematically yield
constraint forces that not only ensure conservation of energy but also enforce
continuity of velocities across sub-domain interfaces. Multiple grid (MG)
connections between non-conforming sub-domains are modeled using mortar
elements whereas coupled multiple time-scale (MT) equations are derived for the
classical Newmark integration algorithm (and its constituents). Fully
discretized equations of motion for component sub-domains, augmented with an
interface condition are then solved using block elimination method and Crout
factorization.
  A proof of stability is provided using Energy method and overall efficiency,
accuracy and stability of multiple sub-domain coupling is evaluated using a
series of numerical examples. Primary observations are made for the evolution
and distribution of kinematic quantities and structural wave propagation across
connecting sub-domain. Numerical stability is verified by ensuring energy
balance at global as well as component sub-domain level. Discussed examples
highlight the greatest advantage of MGMT method; which is high simulation
speedups (at the cost of reasonably small errors).

multiple estimation model configurations. For example, ss3sim can be used to
answer questions about model misspecification, retrospective patterns, and the
relative importance of different types of fisheries data. We demonstrate the

perfect secrecy and reliable communication over a noisy channel that is
eavesdropped by an adversary with unlimited computational power. This goal is
achieved by taking advantage of the channel noise and without requiring a
shared key. The model has attracted attention in recent years because it
captures eavesdropping attack in wireless communication. The wiretap adversary
is a passive eavesdropping adversary at the physical layer of communication. In
this paper we propose a model for adversarial wiretap (AWTP) channel that
models active adversaries at this layer. We consider a $(\rho_r, \rho_w)$
wiretap adversary who can see a fraction $\rho_r$, and modify a fraction
$\rho_w$, of the sent codeword. The code components that are read and/or
modified can be chosen adaptively, and the subsets of read and modified
components in general, can be different. AWTP codes provide secrecy and
reliability for communication over these channels. We give security and
reliability definitions and measures for these codes, and define secrecy
capacity of an AWTP channel that represents the secrecy potential of the
channel. The paper has two main contributions. First, we prove a tight upper
bound on the rate of AWTP codes with perfect secrecy for $(\rho_r,
\rho_w)$-AWTP channels, and use the bound to derive the secrecy capacity of the
channel. We prove a similar bound for $\epsilon$-secure codes also, but in this
case the bound is not tight. Second, we give an explicit construction for a
capacity achieving AWTP code family, and prove its security and efficiency
properties. We show that AWTP model is a natural generalization of Wyner's
wiretap models and somewhat surprisingly, also provides a direct generalization
for a seemingly unrelated cryptographic primitive, Secure Message Transmission
(SMT).

particular, a long-range spin-triplet helix is predicted when these two
spin-orbit couplings have equal strengths. We also study the Josephson junction
geometry and show that a transition between 0 and $\pi$ junctions can be
induced by controlling the spin-orbit coupling with a gate voltage. An
experimental setup is proposed to verify these effects. Conversely, the
observation of these effects can serve as a direct confirmation of triplet
superconductivity.

from 0.12 to 27.5 K. From the surface impedance we obtain the microwave

has improved with the recent development of gamma-ray observation techniques.
An open subject in the context of the EBL is the reionization epoch, which is
an important probe of the formation history of first stars, the so-called
Population III (Pop III) stars. Although the mechanisms for the formation of
Pop III stars are rather well understood on theoretical grounds, their
formation history is still veiled in mystery because of their faintness. To
shed light into this matter, we study jointly the gamma-ray opacity of distant
objects and the reionization constraints from studies of intergalactic gas. By
combining these studies, we obtain a sensitive upper bound on the Pop III star
formation rate density as $\dot\rho_{*}(z)<0.01[(1+z)/{(1+7.0)}]^{3.4}({f_{\rm
esc}}/{0.2})^{-1}({C}/{3.0})\ {\rm M}_{\odot} {\rm yr}^{-1}\ {\rm Mpc}^{-3}$ at
$z\ge7$, where $f_{\rm esc}$ and $C$ are the escape fraction of ionizing
photons from galaxies and the clumping factor of the intergalactic hydrogen
gas. This limit is a $\sim10$ times tighter constraint compared with previous
studies that take into account gamma-ray opacity constraints only. Even if we
do not include the current gamma-ray constraints, the results do not change.
This is because the detected gamma-ray sources are still at $z\le4.35$ where
the reionization has already finished.

number of technological, environmental and political challenges linked to
supplementing existing electricity generation capacities with wind energy.
Here, mathematicians and statisticians could make a substantial contribution at
the interface of meteorology and decision-making, in connection with the
generation of forecasts tailored to the various operational decision problems

source of energy, full benefits from its usage can only be obtained if one is
able to accommodate its variability and limited predictability. Based on a
short presentation of its physical basics, the importance of considering wind
power generation as a stochastic process is motivated. After describing
representative operational decision-making problems for both market
participants and system operators, it is underlined that forecasts should be
issued in a probabilistic framework. Even though, eventually, the forecaster
may only communicate single-valued predictions. The existing approaches to wind
power forecasting are subsequently described, with focus on single-valued
predictions, predictive marginal densities and space-time trajectories.

abundance ratios of elements belonging to two different nucleosynthetic
channels: $\alpha$-elements and iron-peak elements. The main results can be
summarised as follows: i) cluster members are chemically homogeneous within
3-$\sigma$ in all analysed elements; ii) the three clusters have comparable
[El/Fe] patters within $\sim$1-$\sigma$, but they differ in their global metal
content [El/H], with NGC 4815 having the lowest metallicity. Their [El/Fe]
ratios show differences and analogies with those of the field population, both

abundance ratios with the results of two chemical evolution models and with
field star abundance distributions, we find that the abundance ratios of Mg,
Ni, Ca in NGC 6705 might require an inner birthplace, implying a subsequent
variation of its R$_{GC}$ during its lifetime, consistent with previous orbit
determination. The full dataset of the Gaia-ESO Survey will be a superlative

choice of coordinates, can impede the identification of general structure, so
it is too with an explicit parameterisation of system dynamics by control.
However, such explicit and fixed parameterisation by control is commonplace in
control theory, leading to definitions, methodologies, and results that depend
in unexpected ways on control parameterisation. In this paper a framework is
presented for modelling systems in geometric control theory in a manner that
does not make any choice of parameterisation by control; the systems are called
""tautological control systems."" For the framework to be coherent, it relies in
a fundamental way on topologies for spaces of vector fields. As such, classes
of systems are considered possessing a variety of degrees of regularity:
finitely differentiable; Lipschitz; smooth; real analytic. In each case,
explicit geometric seminorms are provided for the topologies of spaces of
vector fields that enable straightforward descriptions of time-varying vector
fields and control systems. As part of the development, theorems are proved for
regular (including real analytic) dependence on initial conditions of flows of
vector fields depending measurably on time. Classes of ""ordinary"" control
systems are characterised that interact with the regularity under consideration
in a comprehensive way. In this framework, for example, the statement that ""a
smooth or real analytic control-affine system is a smooth or real analytic
control system"" becomes a theorem. Correspondences between ordinary control
systems and tautological control systems are carefully examined, and trajectory
correspondence between the two classes is proved for control-affine systems and
for systems with general control dependence when the control set is compact.

wide range of spatial and temporal scales. A variety of methods have been used
to predict wildfire phenomena during the past century to better our
understanding of fire processes and to inform fire and land management
decision-making. Statistical methods have an important role in wildfire
prediction due to the inherent stochastic nature of fire phenomena at all
scales. Predictive models have exploited several sources of data describing
fire phenomena. Experimental data are scarce; observational data are dominated
by statistics compiled by government fire management agencies, primarily for
administrative purposes and increasingly from remote sensing observations.
Fires are rare events at many scales. The data describing fire phenomena can be
zero-heavy and nonstationary over both space and time. Users of fire modeling
methodologies are mainly fire management agencies often working under great
time constraints, thus, complex models have to be efficiently estimated. We
focus on providing an understanding of some of the information needed for fire
management decision-making and of the challenges involved in predicting fire
occurrence, growth and frequency at regional, national and global scales.

community $s_g$ show a power-law increase $s_{av}\sim n^{\alpha'}$ and $s_g\sim
n^{\alpha}$. From numerical results we estimate $\alpha'\approx 0.26(1)$,
$\alpha\approx 0.50(1)$, and using the probability distribution of sizes of
communities we suggest that $\alpha'=\alpha/2$ should hold. For $p>1$ the
community structure remains critical: (i) $s_{av}$ and $s_g$ have a power law
increase with $\alpha'\approx\alpha <1$; (ii) the probability distribution of
sizes of communities is very broad and nearly flat for all sizes up to $s_g$.
For large $p$ the modularity $Q$ decays as $Q\sim p^{-0.55}$, which is
intermediate between some previous estimations. To check the validity of the
results, we also determined the community structure using another method,
namely a non-greedy optimization of modularity. Tests with some benchmark
networks show that the method outperforms the greedy version. For random
graphs, however, the characteristics of the community structure determined
using both greedy an non-greedy optimizations are, within small statistical
fluctuations, the same.

excitation of magnetization by longitudinal acoustic waves and calculate the

can forward ad-hoc RTP data plane traffic from a browser on one local network
to a browser on another local network. The advantage compared to the existing
IETF STUN (RFC 5389), TURN (RFC 5766) and ICE (RFC 5245) protocols is that it
does not require a public host and port mapping for each participating local
host, and it works with more restrictive firewall policies. WebRTC implements
ICE which combines STUN and TURN probes to automatically find the best
connection between two peers who want to communicate. In corporate networks,
simple hole punching and NAT traversal techniques typically do not work, e.g.
because of symmetric NATs. Dynamic allocation of ports on an external 3rd party
relay service is also typically blocked on restricted hosts. In our use case,
doctors at hospitals can only access port 80 through the hospital firewall on
external machines, and they need to communicate with patients who are typically
behind a NAT in a local WiFi network. VPN solutions only work for staff but not
between patients and staff. Our solution solves this problem by redirecting all
WebRTC traffic through a gateway service on the local network that has a secure
tunnel established with a public gateway. The public gateway redirects traffic
from multiple concurrent streams securely between local gateway services that
connect to it. The local gateways also communicate with browsers on their local
network to mimic a direct browser-to-browser connection without having to
change the browser runtime. We have demonstrated that this technique works well
within the hospital network and arbitrary patient networks, without the need
for any individual host configuration. In our evaluation we show that the
latency overhead is 18-20 ms for each concurrent stream added to the same
gateway service.

the lowest density that is achievable. The intrinsic error fields on MAST have
been determined by the direct measurement of the toroidal asymmetry of the
fields from these coils and have been parameterised in terms of distortions to
the coils. The error fields are corrected using error field correction coils,
where the optimum correction is found by determining the current required to
ensure that the discharge is furthest from the onset of a locked mode. These
empirically derived corrections have been compared with the known coil
distortions. In the vacuum approximation there is a factor of ~ 3 difference
between the predicted and empirically determined correction. When the plasma
response is included better agreement is obtained, but there are still some
cases where the agreement is not good, which suggests that other effects such

  long-baseline neutrino experiment","35 pages, 22 figures, added authors",,,,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The next generation neutrino observatory proposed by the LBNO collaboration
will address fundamental questions in particle and astroparticle physics. The
experiment consists of a far detector, in its first stage a 20 kt LAr double
phase TPC and a magnetised iron calorimeter, situated at 2300 km from CERN and
a near detector based on a high-pressure argon gas TPC. The long baseline
provides a unique opportunity to study neutrino flavour oscillations over their
1st and 2nd oscillation maxima exploring the $L/E$ behaviour, and
distinguishing effects arising from $\delta_{CP}$ and matter.
  In this paper we have reevaluated the physics potential of this setup for
determining the mass hierarchy (MH) and discovering CP-violation (CPV), using a
conventional neutrino beam from the CERN SPS with a power of 750 kW. We use
conservative assumptions on the knowledge of oscillation parameter priors and
systematic uncertainties. The impact of each systematic error and the precision
of oscillation prior is shown. We demonstrate that the first stage of LBNO can
determine unambiguously the MH to $>5\sigma$C.L. over the whole phase space. We
show that the statistical treatment of the experiment is of very high
importance, resulting in the conclusion that LBNO has $\sim$ 100% probability
to determine the MH in at most 4-5 years of running. Since the knowledge of MH
is indispensable to extract $\delta_{CP}$ from the data, the first LBNO phase
can convincingly give evidence for CPV on the $3\sigma$C.L. using today's
knowledge on oscillation parameters and realistic assumptions on the systematic
uncertainties.

To collect the material seven different trap methods were used, arthropods were
classified at order level, Diptera also at family level and of the Diptera
family Psychodidae, genera were also identified. Twenty-eight orders have been
identified, showing some regional differences in composition and abundance. As
a general conclusion we observe that no big statistical differences can be
observed at order or family level (only Diptera) between the protected area and
the non-protected area. This difference shows an unexpected greater diversity
in the non-protected area. At genus level (only Psychodidae) however, the
diversity of moth flies was slightly greater in the preserved area. We conclude
that climatic variations are probably playing an important role at low
systematic level (order and family) and that human intervention (e.g.
agriculture) becomes more important at genus level.

single set of transformation rules, but with fields valued respectively in
R,C,H,O, it was recently shown that tensoring left and right multiplets yields
a Freudenthal-Rosenfeld-Tits magic square of D = 3 supergravities. This was
subsequently tied in with the more familiar R,C,H,O description of spacetime to
give a unified division-algebraic description of extended super Yang-Mills in D
= 3, 4, 6, 10. Here, these constructions are brought together resulting in a
magic pyramid of supergravities. The base of the pyramid in D = 3 is the known
4x4 magic square, while the higher levels are comprised of a 3x3 square in D =
4, a 2x2 square in D = 6 and Type II supergravity at the apex in D = 10. The
corresponding U-duality groups are given by a new algebraic structure, the
magic pyramid formula, which may be regarded as being defined over three
division algebras, one for spacetime and each of the left/right Yang-Mills
multiplets. We also construct a conformal magic pyramid by tensoring conformal
supermultiplets in D = 3, 4, 6. The missing entry in D = 10 is suggestive of an
exotic theory with G/H duality structure F4(4)/Sp(3) x Sp(1).

approximate any real continuous map in the unit interval by a CA on the

itself. Yet, it took many years to realize that three-body borromean systems
that are bound when any two-body subsystem is unbound are abundant in nature.
Here we demonstrate the existence of borromean systems of spin-polarized
(spinless) identical fermions in two spatial dimensions. The ground state with
zero orbital (planar) angular momentum exists in a borromean window between
critical two- and three-body strengths. The doubly degenerate first excited
states of angular momentum one appears only very close to the two-body
threshold. They are the lowest in a possible sequence of so-called super-Efimov
states. While the observation of the super-Efimov scaling could be very
difficult, the borromean ground state should be observable in cold atomic gases
and could be the basis for producing a quantum gas of three-body states in two
dimensions.

emergence of a new field which we call socially-aware networking (SAN). One of
the major features of SAN is that social awareness becomes indispensable

in proton-proton, proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions is to a large
extent universal. We propose a simple parametrization for the probability
distribution of the Fourier coefficient $\varepsilon_n$ in harmonic $n$, which
is in good agreement with Monte-Carlo simulations. Our results provide a simple
explanation for the 4-particle cumulant of triangular flow measured in Pb-Pb
collisions, and for the 4-particle cumulant of elliptic flow recently measured
in p-Pb collisions. Both arise as natural consequences of the condition that
initial anisotropies are bounded by unity. We argue that the initial rms
anisotropy in harmonic $n$ can be directly extracted from the measured ratio
$v_n\{4\}/v_n\{2\}$: this gives direct access to a property of the initial
density profile from experimental data. We also make quantitative predictions
for the small lifting of degeneracy between $v_n\{4\}$, $v_n\{6\}$ and
$v_n\{8\}$. If confirmed by future experiments, they will support the picture
that long-range correlations observed in p-Pb collisions at the LHC originate
from collective flow proportional to the initial anisotropy.

modeling individual and group user needs, interests and preferences. In the
traditional predictive modeling instances are described by observable
variables, called attributes. The goal is to learn a model for predicting the
target variable for unseen instances. For example, for marketing purposes a
company consider profiling a new user based on her observed web browsing
behavior, referral keywords or other relevant information. In many real world
applications the values of some attributes are not only observable, but can be
actively decided by a decision maker. Furthermore, in some of such applications
the decision maker is interested not only to generate accurate predictions, but
to maximize the probability of the desired outcome. For example, a direct
marketing manager can choose which type of a special offer to send to a client
(actionable attribute), hoping that the right choice will result in a positive
response with a higher probability. We study how to learn to choose the value
of an actionable attribute in order to maximize the probability of a desired
outcome in predictive modeling. We emphasize that not all instances are equally
sensitive to changes in actions. Accurate choice of an action is critical for
those instances, which are on the borderline (e.g. users who do not have a
strong opinion one way or the other). We formulate three supervised learning
approaches for learning to select the value of an actionable attribute at an
instance level. We also introduce a focused training procedure which puts more
emphasis on the situations where varying the action is the most likely to take
the effect. The proof of concept experimental validation on two real-world case
studies in web analytics and e-learning domains highlights the potential of the
proposed approaches.

properties ascertained for the main part of the SiC data (the so-called {\it
mainstream} ones), we mention a large range of $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratios,
extending below the solar value \cite{mar}, and $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios
$\gtrsim$ 30. Other classes of grains, instead, display low carbon isotopic
ratios ($\gtrsim 10$) and a huge dispersion for N isotopes, with cases of large
$^{15}$N excess. In the same grains, isotopes currently feeded by slow neutron
captures reveal the characteristic pattern expected from this process at an
efficiency slightly lower than necessary to explain the solar main s-process
component. Complementary constraints can be found in oxide grains, especially
Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ crystals. Here, the oxygen isotopes and the content in
$^{26}$Al are of a special importance for clarifying the partial mixing
processes that are known to affect evolved low-mass stars. Successes in
modeling the data, as well as problems in explaining some of the mentioned
isotopic ratios through current nucleosynthesis models are briefly outlined.

Final version to appear in Advances in Mathematics",,,,"math.AG cs.CC math.AT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Let $\mathrm{R}$ be a real closed field. The problem of obtaining tight
bounds on the Betti numbers of semi-algebraic subsets of $\mathrm{R}^k$ in
terms of the number and degrees of the defining polynomials has been an
important problem in real algebraic geometry with the first results due to
Ole{\u\i}nik and Petrovski{\u\i}, Thom and Milnor. These bounds are all
exponential in the number of variables $k$. Motivated by several applications
in real algebraic geometry, as well as in theoretical computer science, where
such bounds have found applications, we consider in this paper the problem of
bounding the equivariant Betti numbers of symmetric algebraic and
semi-algebraic subsets of $\mathrm{R}^k$. We obtain several asymptotically
tight upper bounds. In particular, we prove that if $S\subset \mathrm{R}^k$ is
a semi-algebraic subset defined by a finite set of $s$ symmetric polynomials of
degree at most $d$, then the sum of the $\mathfrak{S}_k$-equivariant Betti
numbers of $S$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{Q}$ is bounded by $(skd)^{O(d)}$.
Unlike the classical bounds on the ordinary Betti numbers of real algebraic
varieties and semi-algebraic sets, the above bound is polynomial in $k$ when
the degrees of the defining polynomials are bounded by a constant. As an
application we improve the best known bound on the ordinary Betti numbers of
the projection of a compact algebraic set improving for any fixed degree the
best previously known bound for this problem due to Gabrielov, Vorobjov and
Zell.

years, starting with the result of Bodlaender et al. [FOCS 2009] on graphs of
bounded genus, then generalized by Fomin et al. [SODA 2010] to graphs excluding
a fixed minor, and by Kim et al. [ICALP 2013] to graphs excluding a fixed
topological minor. Typically, these results guarantee the existence of linear
or polynomial kernels on sparse graph classes for problems satisfying some
generic conditions but, mainly due to their generality, it is not clear how to
derive from them constructive kernels with explicit constants. In this paper we
make a step toward a fully constructive meta-kernelization theory on sparse
graphs. Our approach is based on a more explicit protrusion replacement
machinery that, instead of expressibility in CMSO logic, uses dynamic
programming, which allows us to find an explicit upper bound on the size of the
derived kernels. We demonstrate the usefulness of our techniques by providing
the first explicit linear kernels for $r$-Dominating Set and $r$-Scattered Set
on apex-minor-free graphs, and for Planar-\mathcal{F}-Deletion on graphs
excluding a fixed (topological) minor in the case where all the graphs in
\mathcal{F} are connected.

convert the energy of the nuclear reaction into usable form. The heat produced
will be removed from the reactor core by a primary coolant, which might be
water, helium, molten lithium-lead, molten lithium-containing salt, or CO2. The
heat could then be transferred to a conventional Rankine cycle or Brayton (gas
turbine) cycle. Alternatively it could be used for thermochemical processes
such as producing hydrogen or other transport fuels. Fusion presents new
problems because of the high energy neutrons released. These affect the
selection of materials and the operating temperature, ultimately determining
the choice of coolant and working cycle. The limited temperature ranges allowed
by present day irradiated structural materials, combined with the large
internal power demand of the plant, will limit the overall thermal efficiency.
The operating conditions of the fusion power source, the materials, coolant,

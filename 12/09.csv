multiple-input multiple-output system in the presence of Wiener phase noise due
to noisy local oscillators. As in single-antenna systems, the computation of
the optimal receiver is an infinite dimensional problem and is thus
unimplementable in practice. In this purview, we propose three suboptimal,
low-complexity algorithms for approximately implementing the MAP symbol
detector, which involve joint phase noise estimation and data detection. Our
first algorithm is obtained by means of the sum-product algorithm, where we use
the multivariate Tikhonov canonical distribution approach. In our next
algorithm, we derive an approximate MAP symbol detector based on the
smoother-detector framework, wherein the detector is properly designed by
incorporating the phase noise statistics from the smoother. The third algorithm
is derived based on the variational Bayesian framework. By simulations, we
evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms for both uncoded and coded
data transmissions, and we observe that the proposed techniques significantly
outperform the other algorithms proposed in the literature.

rapidly forming a clot to restrict the loss of blood. Platelets aggregation at
the injury site of the blood vessel occurring via platelet-platelet adhesion,
tethering and rolling on the injured endothelium is a critical initial step in
blood clot formation. A novel three-dimensional multiscale model is introduced
and used in this paper to simulate receptor-mediated adhesion of deformable
platelets at the site of vascular injury under different shear rates of blood
flow. The novelty of the model is based on a new approach of coupling submodels
at three biological scales crucial for the early clot formation: novel hybrid
cell membrane submodel to represent physiological elastic properties of a
platelet, stochastic receptor-ligand binding submodel to describe cell adhesion
kinetics and Lattice Boltzmann submodel for simulating blood flow. The model
implementation on the GPUs cluster significantly improved simulation
performance. Predictive model simulations revealed that platelet deformation,
interactions between platelets in the vicinity of the vessel wall as well as
the number of functional GPIb{\alpha} platelet receptors played significant
roles in the platelet adhesion to the injury site. Variation of the number of
functional GPIb{\alpha} platelet receptors as well as changes of platelet
stiffness can represent effects of specific drugs reducing or enhancing
platelet activity. Therefore, predictive simulations can improve the search for
new drug targets and help to make treatment of thrombosis patient specific.

configurations of the Karl G. Jansky VLA has revealed a new population of faint
radio filaments. Like their brighter counterparts that have been observed
throughout the Galactic Center on larger scales, these filaments can extend up
to ~10 parsecs, and in most cases are strikingly uniform in brightness and
curvature. Comparison with a survey of Paschen-alpha emission reveals that some
of the filaments are emitting thermally, but most of these structures are
nonthermal: local magnetic flux tubes illuminated by synchrotron emission. The
new image reveals considerable filamentary substructure in previously known
nonthermal filaments (NTFs). Unlike NTFs previously observed on larger scales,
which tend to show a predominant orientation roughly perpendicular to the
Galactic plane, the NTFs in the vicinity of the Sgr A complex are relatively
randomly oriented. Two well-known radio sources to the south of Sgr A - sources
E and F - consist of numerous quasi-parallel filaments that now appear to be
particularly bright portions of a much larger, strongly curved, continuous,
nonthermal radio structure that we refer to as the ""Southern Curl"". It is
therefore unlikely that sources E and F are HII regions or pulsar wind nebulae.
The Southern Curl has a smaller counterpart on the opposite side of the
Galactic Center - the Northern Curl - that, except for its smaller scale and
smaller distance from the center, is roughly point-reflection symmetric with
respect to the Southern Curl. The curl features indicate that some field lines
are strongly distorted, presumably by mass flows. The point symmetry about the
center then suggests that the flows originate near the center and are somewhat
collimated.

there is no inherent support for robust operation, and if a new better
component becomes available, one cannot easily replace the old component.
Fourth, they are viewed as a resource to be developed and owned, not as a

specific mechanisms for creating and operating cognitive systems that fulfill a
set of desiderata: First, that are distributed yet situated, interacting with

combining human as well as machine services. Second, that are made up of
components that are time-shared and re-usable. Third, that provide increased
robustness through self-repair. Fourth, that are constructed and reconstructed
on the fly, with components that dynamically enter and exit the system during
operation, on the basis of availability, pricing, and need. Importantly, fifth,

almost surely decreasing, and the $L_2$-coupling creation is computed
explicitly. Some quasi-contractive and uniform in $N$ coupling / coupling
creation inequalities are then proved, relying on $2+\alpha$-moments ($\alpha
>0$) of velocity distributions; upon $N$-uniform propagation of moments of the
particle system, it yields a $N$-scalable $\alpha$-power law trend to
equilibrium. The latter are based on an original sharp inequality, which bounds
from above the coupling distance of two centered and normalized random
variables $(U,V)$ in $\R^d$, with the average square parallelogram area spanned
by $(U-U_\ast,V-V_\ast)$, $(U_\ast,V_\ast)$ denoting an independent copy. Two
counter-examples proving the necessity of the dependance on $>2$-moments and
the impossibility of strict contractivity are provided. The paper, (mostly)
self-contained, does not require any propagation of chaos property and uses
only elementary tools.

by using weak Galerkin (WG) finite element methods. The Brinkman equations can
be viewed mathematically as a combination of the Stokes and Darcy equations
which model fluid flow in a multi-physics environment, such as flow in complex
porous media with a permeability coefficient highly varying in the simulation
domain. In such applications, the flow is dominated by Darcy in some regions
and by Stokes in others. It is well known that the usual Stokes stable elements
do not work well for Darcy flow and vise versa. The challenge of this study is
on the design of numerical schemes which are stable for both the Stokes and the
Darcy equations. This paper shows that the WG finite element method is capable
of meeting this challenge by providing a numerical scheme that is stable and
accurate for both Darcy and the Stokes dominated flows. Error estimates of
optimal order are established for the corresponding WG finite element
solutions. The paper also presents some numerical experiments that demonstrate
the robustness, reliability, flexibility and accuracy of the WG method for the
Brinkman equations.

and magnetic properties of two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal dichalcogenide
(TMD) heterobilayers MX2/MoS2 (M = Mo, Cr, W, Fe, V; X = S, Se). For M = Mo,
Cr, W; X=S, Se, all heterobilayers show semiconducting characteristics with an
indirect bandgap with the exception of the WSe2/MoS2 heterobilayer which
retains the direct-band-gap character of the constituent monolayer. For M = Fe,
V; X = S, Se, the MX2/MoS2 heterobilayers exhibit metallic characters.
Particular attention of this study has been focused on engineering bandgap of
the TMD heterobilayer materials via application of either a tensile strain or
an external electric field. We find that with increasing either the biaxial or
uniaxial tensile strain, the MX2/MoS2 (M=Mo, Cr, W; X=S, Se) heterobilayers can
undergo a semiconductor-to-metal transition. For the WSe2/MoS2 heterobilayer, a
direct-to-indirect bandgap transition may occur beyond a critical biaxial or
uniaxial strain. For M (=Fe, V) and X (=S, Se), the magnetic moments of both
metal and chalcogen atoms are enhanced when the MX2/MoS2 heterobilayers are
under a biaxial tensile strain. Moreover, the bandgap of MX2/MoS2 (M=Mo, Cr, W;
X=S, Se) heterobilayers can be reduced by the electric field. For two
heterobilayers MSe2/MoS2 (M=Mo, Cr), PBE calculations suggest that the
indirect-to-direct bandgap transition may occur under an external electric
field. The transition is attributed to the enhanced spontaneous polarization.
The tunable bandgaps in general and possible indirect-direct bandgap
transitions due to tensile strain or external electric field endow the TMD
heterobilayer materials a viable candidate for optoelectronic applications.

properties of high momentum distribution of nucleons in asymmetric nuclei for

relation between proton and neutron high momentum distributions weighted by
their relative fractions ($x_p$ and $x_n$) in the nucleus. The second is the
existence of inverse proportionality of the high momentum distribution strength
of protons and neutrons to $x_{p/n}$. Based on these predictions we model the
high momentum distribution functions for asymmetric nuclei and demonstrate that
it describes reasonably well the high momentum characteristics of light nuclei.
We also extrapolate our results to heavy nuclei as well as infinite nuclear
matter and calculate the relative fractions of protons and neutrons with
momenta above $k_{F}$. Our results indicate that for neutron stars starting at
{\em three} nuclear saturation densities the protons with $x_p = {1\over 9}$
will populate mostly the high momentum tail of the momentum distribution while
only $2\%$ of the neutrons will do so. Such a situation may have many
implications for different observations of neutron stars which we discuss.

($10^{41}<$L(2-10)$<10^{45.5}$). Both a simple statistical method to asses the
significance of variability, and the Normalized Excess Variance
($\sigma^{2}_{rms}$) parameter, where used to obtain a quantitative measurement
of the variability. Variability is found to be prevalent in most AGN, whenever
we have good statistic to measure it, and no significant differences between
type-1 and type-2 AGN were found. A flat (slope -0.23+/-0.03) anti-correlation
between $\sigma^{2}_{rms}$ and X-ray luminosity is found, when significantly
variable sources are considered all together. When divided in three redshift
bins, the anti-correlation becomes stronger and evolving with z, with higher
redshift AGN being more variable. We prove however that this effect is due to
the pre-selection of variable sources: considering all the sources with
available $\sigma^{2}_{rms}$ measurement, the evolution in redshift disappears.
For the first time we were also able to study the long term X-ray variability
as a function of $M_{\rm BH}$ and Eddington ratio, for a large sample of AGN
spanning a wide range of redshift. An anti-correlation between
$\sigma^{2}_{rms}$ and $M_{\rm BH}$ is found, with the same slope of the
anti-correlation between $\sigma^{2}_{rms}$ and X-ray luminosity, suggesting
that the latter can be a byproduct of the former one. No clear correlation is
found between $\sigma^{2}_{rms}$ and the Eddington ratio in our sample.
Finally, no correlation is found between the X-ray $\sigma^{2}_{rms}$ and the
optical variability.

this OFDM SAR imaging algorithm, the minimum required CP length is almost equal
to the number of range cells in a swath, while the number of subcarriers of an

transmitted OFDM sequence at least almost twice of the number of range cells in

long, which may cause problems in some radar applications. In this paper, we
propose a CP based OFDM SAR imaging with arbitrary pulse length, which has IRCI

under some simple and intuitive hypothesis, the exit probability must obey the
inequality, $\frac{\rho^q}{\rho^q + (1-\rho)} \leq E(\rho) \leq
\frac{\rho}{\rho + (1-\rho)^q}$, in the infinite size limit. We believe this
settles in the negative the suggestion made (2011 EPL 95 48005) that this
result would be a finite size effect, with the exit probability actualy being a
step function. We also show how the result, that the exit probability cannot be

super-metal-rich open cluster NGC6791. The current evidence is supported by
several diagnostics (red horizontal branch, red giant branch bump, shape of the
sub-giant branch, slope of the main sequence) that are minimally affected by
uncertainties in reddening and distance. We fit the optical observations with
theoretical isochrones based on a scaled-solar chemical mixture and found an
age of 11 +- 1 Gyr and an iron abundance slightly above solar ([Fe/H = +0.20).
The iron abundance and the old cluster age further support the recent
spectroscopic findings suggesting a rapid chemical enrichment of the Galactic
Bulge.

radially symmetric about the center-drop line. In the case of the steady mode,
the pdf is approximately Gaussian distributed, with variances that are small,
indicating that the coin is most likely to land at the center, right below the
point it is dropped from. For the other falling modes, the center is one of the
least likely landing sites. Indeed, the pdf's of the fluttering, chaotic and
tumbling modes are characterized by a ""dip"" around the center. For the tumbling
mode, the pdf is a ring configuration about the center-line, with a ring width
that depends on the dimensionless parameters $I^\ast$ and Re and height from
which the coin is dropped. For the chaotic mode, the pdf is generally a
broadband distribution spread out radially symmetrically about the center-line.
For the steady and fluttering modes, the coin never flips, so the coin lands
with the same side up as was dropped. For the chaotic mode, the probability of

over the volatility variable on a compact set, and (after a gauge
transformation) we use the Davies \cite{Dav88} upper bound for the heat kernel
on a manifold with bounded Ricci curvature to deal with the tail integrals. If
the correlation $\rho < 0$, our approach still works if the drift of the

model with three scalar field matrices and gauge fields in the adjoint

appears as the effective inflaton while the rest of the fields (scalar and
gauge fields) can play the role of isocurvature fields during inflation and
preheat fields afterwards. There is a region in parameter space and initial
field values, ""the hilltop region,"" where predictions of the model are quite
compatible with the recent Planck data. We show that in this hilltop region, if
the inflaton ends up in the supersymmetric vacuum, the model can have an
embedded preheating mechanism. Couplings of the preheat modes are related to
the inflaton self-couplings and therefore are known from the CMB data. Through
lattice simulations performed using a symplectic integrator, we numerically
compute the power spectra of gravitational waves produced during the preheating
stage following M-flation. The preliminary numerical simulation of the spectrum

distributed (i.i.d.) sequence that is drawn from a probability distribution
$f_1$ by searching over multiple sequences, some of which are drawn from $f_1$
and the others of which are drawn from a different distribution $f_0$, is
considered. The observer is allowed to take one observation at a time. It has
been shown in a recent work that if each observation comes from one sequence,
the cumulative sum test is optimal. In this paper, we propose a new approach in
which each observation can be a linear combination of samples from multiple
sequences. The test has two stages. In the first stage, namely scanning stage,
one takes a linear combination of a pair of sequences with the hope of scanning
through sequences that are unlikely to be generated from $f_1$ and quickly
identifying a pair of sequences such that at least one of them is highly likely
to be generated by $f_1$. In the second stage, namely refinement stage, one
examines the pair identified from the first stage more closely and picks one
sequence to be the final sequence. The problem under this setup belongs to a
class of multiple stopping time problems. In particular, it is an ordered two
concatenated Markov stopping time problem. We obtain the optimal solution using
the tools from the multiple stopping time theory. The optimal solution has a
rather complex structure. For implementation purpose, a low complexity
algorithm is proposed, in which the observer adopts the cumulative sum test in
the scanning stage and adopts the sequential probability ratio test in the
refinement stage. The performance of this low complexity algorithm is analyzed
when the prior probability of $f_{1}$ occurring is small. Both analytical and
numerical simulation results show that this search strategy can significantly
reduce the searching time when $f_{1}$ is rare.

of the standard model. We demonstrate that a time-dependent effective potential
is quite possible in a protoneutron star (PNS) at certain stages of its
evolution. For the first time, we formulate a nonperturbative treatment of
neutrino processes in a matter with arbitrary time-dependent effective
potential. Using linearly growing effective potential, we study the typical
case of a slowly varying matter interaction potential. We calculate
differential mean numbers of $\nu \bar{\nu}$ pairs created from the vacuum by
this potential and find that they crucially depend on the magnitude of masses
of the lightest neutrino eigenstate. These distributions uniformly span up to
$\sim 10$ eV energies for muon and tau neutrinos created in PNS core due to the
compression just before the hydrodynamic bounce and up to $\sim 0.1$ eV
energies for all three active neutrino flavors created in the neutronization.
Considering different stages of the PNS evolution, we derive constraints on
neutrino masses, $m_{\nu}\lesssim (10^{-8}-10^{-7})$ eV corresponding to the
nonvanishing $\nu \bar{\nu}$ pairs flux produced by this mechanism. We show
that one can distinguish such coherent flux from chaotic fluxes of any other
origin. Part of these neutrinos, depending on the flavor and helicity, are
bounded in the PNS, while antineutrinos of any flavor escape the PNS. If the
created pairs are $\nu_{e}\bar{\nu}_{e}$, then a part of the corresponding
neutrinos also escape the PNS. The detection of $\nu $ and $\bar{\nu}$ with
such low energies is beyond current experimental techniques.

using a Skyrme model constructed with an effective Lagrangian which includes
the $\rho$ and $\omega$ vector mesons as hidden gauge bosons and is valid up to
$O(p^4)$ in chiral expansion including the homogeneous Wess-Zumino terms. With
the two input values of pion decay constant and the lowest lying vector meson
mass which can be fixed in free space, all the other low energy constants in
the effective Lagrangian are determined by their master formulas derived from
holographic QCD models, which allows us to study the baryonic matter properties
with no additional free parameters and thus without ambiguities. We find that
the $\omega$ field that figures in the homogeneous Wess-Zumino term plays a
crucial role in the skyrmion structure and its matter properties. The most
striking and intriguing observation is that the pion decay constant that
smoothly drops with increasing density in the Skyrmion phase stops decreasing
at $n_{1/2}^{}$ at which the skyrmions in medium fractionize into
half-skyrmions and remains nearly constant in the half-skyrmion phase. In
accordance with the large $N_c$ consideration, the baryon mass also stays
non-scaling in the half-skyrmion phase. This feature is supported by the
nuclear effective field theory with the parameters of the Lagrangian scaling
modified at the skyrmion--half-skyrmion phase transition. Our exploration also
uncovers the crucial role of the $\omega$ meson in multi-baryon systems as well
as in the structure of a single skyrmion.

These websites typically incentivize participation by awarding users badges
based on their contributions. While these badges typically have no explicit
value, they act as symbols of social status within a community. In this paper,
we consider the design of badge mechanisms for the objective of maximizing the
total contributions made to a website. Users exert costly effort to make
contributions and, in return, are awarded with badges. A badge is only valued
to the extent that it signals social status and thus badge valuations are
determined endogenously by the number of users who earn each badge. The goal of
this paper is to study the design of optimal and approximately badge mechanisms
under these status valuations. We characterize badge mechanisms by whether they
use a coarse partitioning scheme, i.e. awarding the same badge to many users,
or use a fine partitioning scheme, i.e. awarding a unique badge to most users.
We find that the optimal mechanism uses both fine partitioning and coarse
partitioning. When status valuations exhibit a decreasing marginal value
property, we prove that coarse partitioning is a necessary feature of any
approximately optimal mechanism. Conversely, when status valuations exhibit an
increasing marginal value property, we prove that fine partitioning is
necessary for approximate optimality.

steep spectra (alpha_{1.4}^{20} < -0.5) and 45% have flat or inverted spectra
(alpha_{1.4}^{20} >= -0.5).
  The steep-spectrum sources tend to have single power-law spectra between 1.4
and 18 GHz, while the spectral indices of the flat- or inverted-spectrum
sources tend to steepen with frequency. Among the 18 inverted-spectrum
(alpha_{1.4}^{20} >= 0.0) sources, 10 have clearly defined peaks in their
spectra with alpha_{1.4}^{5.5} > 0.15 and alpha_{9}^{18} < -0.15. On a 3-yr
timescale, at least 10 sources varied by more than 15% at 20 GHz, showing that
variability is still common at the low flux densities probed by the AT20G-deep

  We find a strong and puzzling shift in the typical spectral index of the
15-20 GHz source population when combining data from the AT20G, Ninth Cambridge

population when going from ~1 Jy to ~5 mJy, which is followed by a shift back
towards a flatter-spectrum population below ~5 mJy. The 5-GHz source-count
model by Jackson & Wall (1999), which only includes contributions from FRI and
FRII sources, and star-forming galaxies, does not reproduce the observed
flattening of the flat-spectrum counts below ~5 mJy. It is therefore possible
that another population of sources is contributing to this effect.

explored the challenges of making precision astronomical measurements using
deeply depleted (thick) CCDs. While thick CCDs provide definite advantages in
terms of increased quantum efficiency at NIR wavelengths, and reduced fringing
from atmospheric emission lines, these devices also exhibit undesirable
features that pose a challenge to precision determination of the positions,
fluxes, and shapes of astronomical objects, and features in astronomical
spectra. Many of the effects seen in these devices arise from lateral
electrical fields within the detector, that produce charge transport anomalies
that have been previously misinterpreted as quantum efficiency variations.
Performing simplistic flat-fielding introduces systematic errors in the image
processing pipeline. One measurement challenge is devising a calibration method
that can distinguish genuine quantum efficiency variations from charge
transport effects. Given the scientific benefits of improving both the
precision and accuracy of astronomical measurements, we need to identify,
characterize, and overcome these various detector artifacts. In retrospect,
many of the detector features first identified in thick CCDs also afflict
measurements made with more traditional CCD detectors, albeit often at a
reduced level. I provide a qualitative overview of the physical effects we
think are responsible for the observed device properties, and provide some
perspective for the work that lies ahead. Finally, I take this opportunity to
make a plea for establishing a clear and consistent vocabulary when describing
these various detector features, and make some suggestions for a standard
lexicon based on discussions at the workshop.

high confidence using as few label queries as possible, by selecting the

  Previous work in Bayesian active learning considers Generalized Binary

required by these sampling strategies. In this paper, we show that these
schemes are, in general, suboptimal. Instead we propose and analyze an
alternative strategy for sample collection. Our sampling strategy is motivated
by a connection between Bayesian active learning and active hypothesis testing,

Jensen-Shannon divergence at each step. We provide upper and lower bounds on
the performance of this sampling strategy, and show that these bounds are
better than previous bounds.

amount of time needed to factor a 1024-bit number on several candidate quantum
technologies that differ in their clock speed and reliability. We make several
interesting observations. First, topological quantum error correction requires
fewer resources when physical gate error rates are high, white concatenated
codes have smaller overhead for physical gate error rates below approximately
10E-7. Consequently, we show that different error-correcting codes should be
chosen for two of the studied physical quantum technologies - ion traps and
superconducting qubits. Second, we observe that the composition of the
elementary gate types occurring in a typical logical circuit, a fault-tolerant
circuit protected by the surface code, and a fault-tolerant circuit protected
by a concatenated code all differ. This also suggests that choosing the most
appropriate error correction technique depends on the ability of the future

nanostructures (NSs) and the structural, electronic, and optical properties in
terms of quantum confinement (QC). QC in NSs causes a blue shift of the gap
energy with decreasing NS dimension. Directly measuring the effect of QC is
complicated by additional parameters, such as stress, interface and defect
states. In addition, differences in NS preparation lead to differences in the
relevant parameter set. A relatively simple model of QC, using a
`particle-in-a-box'-type perturbation to the effective mass theory, was applied
to Si and Ge quantum wells, wires and dots across a variety of preparation
methods. The choice of the model was made in order to distinguish contributions
that are solely due to the effects of QC, where the only varied experimental
parameter was the crystallinity. It was found that the hole becomes
de-localized in the case of amorphous materials, which leads to stronger
confinement effects. The origin of this result was partly attributed to
differences in the effective mass between the amorphous and crystalline NS as
well as between the electron and hole. Corrections to our QC model take into
account a position dependent effective mass. This term includes an inverse
length scale dependent on the displacement from the origin. Thus, when the
deBroglie wavelength or the Bohr radius of the carriers is on the order of the
dimension of the NS the carriers `feel' the confinement potential altering
their effective mass. Furthermore, it was found that certain interface states
(Si-O-Si) act to pin the hole state, thus reducing the oscillator strength.

identified that above $D\approx$ 6.2 nm: $E_{G}\sim D^{-1}$ due to a changing
effective mass (EM), while below $D\approx$ 4.6 nm: $E_{G}\sim D^{-2}$ due to
electron/ hole confinement. We propose that as the QD size is initially
reduced, the EM is reduced, which increases the Bohr radius and interface
scattering until eventually pure quantum confinement effects dominate at small
$D$.

density when the topology of the Fermi surface is changed after the
introduction of holes. On the other hand, the anisotropy of the Drude weight
monotonically decreases reflecting the distortion of the Dirac Fermi surface
and eventually leads to the reverse of anisotropy of resistivity, being
consistent with experiment. The origin of the anisotropy is thus attributed to
the interplay of impurity scattering and anisotropic electronic states.

a soft error corrupt a bit in an IEEE-754 floating-point number. We show how
this finding relates to the fundamental linear algebra concepts of
normalization and matrix equilibration. We present a case study illustrating
that the probability of experiencing a large error in a dot product is
minimized when both vectors are normalized. Furthermore, when data is
normalized we show that the absolute error is less than one or very large,
which allows us to detect large errors. We demonstrate how this finding can be
used by instrumenting the GMRES iterative solver. We count all possible errors
that can be introduced through faults in arithmetic in the computationally
intensive orthogonalization phase, and show that when scaling is used the
absolute error can be bounded above by one.

amplitude approach. We extend a previous work to include all ground state octet
and decuplet final states with full topological amplitudes. Relations on rates
and CP asymmetries are obtained. The number of independent topological
amplitudes is significantly reduced in the large $m_B$ asymptotic limit. With
the long awaited $\overline B{}^0\to p\bar p$ data, we can finally extract
information on the topological amplitudes and predict rates of all other modes.
The predicted rates are in general with uncertainties of a factor of two by
including corrections to the asymptotic relations and from sub-leading
contributions. We point out some modes that will cascadely decay to all charged
final states and have large decay rates. For example, $\overline B
{}^0_s\to\Omega^-\overline{\Omega^-}$, $B^-\to p\overline{\Delta^{++}}$,
$B^-\to \Lambda\bar p$ and $\overline B{}^0_s\to \Lambda\overline{\Lambda}$
decays are interesting modes to search for. We find that the $\overline
B{}^0\to p\bar p$ mode is the most accessible one among octet-anti-octet final
states in the $\Delta S=0$ transition. It is not surprise that it is the first
one being found. With the detection of $\pi^0$ and/or $\gamma$ many other
unsuppressed modes can be searched for. The predicted $\overline B{}^0_s\to
p\bar p$ rate is several order smaller than the present experimental result.
The central value of the experimental result can be reproduced only with
unnaturally scaled up ""subleading contributions"", which will affect other modes
including the $\overline B{}^0\to p\bar p$ decay. We need more data to clarify
the situation. The analysis presented in this work can be systematically

cognitive radio (CR) networks sharing the geographically used or unused
spectrum. We consider a single cell network formed by the primary users (PU),
which are half-duplex two-hop relay channels and the secondary users (SU) are
single user additive white Gaussian noise channels. In addition, the
coexistence constraint which requires PUs' coding schemes and rates unchanged
with the emergence of SU, should be satisfied. The contribution of this paper
are twofold. First, we explicitly design the scheme to pair the SUs to the
existing PUs in a single cell network. Second, we jointly design the nonlinear
precoder, relay beamformer, and the transmitter and receiver beamformers to
minimize the sum mean square error of the SU system. In the first part, we
derive an approximate relation between the relay ratio, chordal distance and
strengths of the vector channels, and the transmit powers. Based on this
relation, we are able to solve the optimal pairing between SUs and PUs
efficiently. In the second part, considering the feasibility of implementation,
we exploit the Tomlinson-Harashima precoding instead of the dirty paper coding
to mitigate the interference at the SU receiver, which is known side
information at the SU transmitter. To complete the design, we first approximate
the optimization problem as a convex one. Then we propose an iterative
algorithm to solve it with CVX. This joint design exploits all the degrees of
design. To the best of our knowledge, both the two parts have never been
considered in the literature. Numerical results show that the proposed pairing
scheme outperforms the greedy and random pairing with low complexity. Numerical
results also show that even if all the channel matrices are full rank, under
which the simple zero forcing scheme is infeasible, the proposed scheme can
still work well.

show that the amplitude and direction of this long-range current can be

applied voltage can produce a nonequilibrium spin-dependent quasiparticle
distribution in the metal regions so that the Cooper pairs acquire an extra
momenta, which will lead to a spin-flip processes in the metal regions. This
processes can produce the parallel spin triplet pairs in the central

Josephson current will appear because of the transport of an even number of

the so-called Hubble flow functions to reach the desired accuracy. Starting
from any cosmological data set, the effective likelihood is obtained by
marginalisation over the standard cosmological parameters, here viewed as

basic machine-learning algorithms can be trained to accurately reproduce its

  note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1003.3139",,,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Conceptual dependencies (CDs) are particular kinds of key dependencies (KDs)
and inclusion dependencies (IDs) that precisely characterize relational
schemata modeled according to the main features of the Entity-Relationship (ER)
model. An instance for such a schema may be inconsistent (data violate the
dependencies) and incomplete (data constitute a piece of correct information,
but not necessarily all the relevant information). While undecidable under
general KDs and IDs, query answering under incomplete data is known to be
decidable for CDs. The known techniques are based on the chase -- a special
instance, organized in levels of depth, that is a representative of all the
instances that satisfy the dependencies and that include the initial instance.
Although the chase generally has infinite size, query answering can be
addressed by posing the query (or a rewriting thereof) on a finite, initial
part of the chase. Contrary to previous claims, we show that the maximum level
of such an initial part cannot be bounded by a constant that does not depend on
the size of the initial instance.

the reweighted $l_1$ minimization performs exceptionally well in recovering
sparse signal. In this paper, we develop exact recovery conditions and
algorithm for sparse signal via weighted $l_1$ minimization from the insight of
the classical NSP (null space property) and RIC (restricted isometry constant)
bound. We first introduce the concept of WNSP (weighted null space property)
and reveal that it is a necessary and sufficient condition for exact recovery.
We then prove that the RIC bound by weighted $l_1$ minimization is
$\delta_{ak}<\sqrt{\frac{a-1}{a-1+\gamma^2}}$, where $a>1$, $0<\gamma\leq1$ is
determined by an optimization problem over the null space. When $\gamma< 1$
this bound is greater than $\sqrt{\frac{a-1}{a}}$ from $l_1$ minimization. In
addition, we also establish the bound on $\delta_k$ and show that it can be
larger than the sharp one 1/3 via $l_1$ minimization and also greater than
0.4343 via weighted $l_1$ minimization under some mild cases. Finally, we
achieve a modified iterative reweighted $l_1$ minimization (MIRL1) algorithm
based on our selection principle of weight, and the numerical experiments
demonstrate that our algorithm behaves much better than $l_1$ minimization and
iterative reweighted $l_1$ minimization (IRL1) algorithm.

has been investigated via breakup on a carbon target of secondary beams of
$^{14,15}$B at 35 MeV/nucleon. The coincident detection of the beam velocity
$^{12}$Be fragments and neutrons permitted the invariant mass of the
$^{12}$Be+$n$ and $^{12}$Be+$n$+$n$ systems to be reconstructed. In the case of
the breakup of $^{15}$B, a very narrow structure at threshold was observed in
the $^{12}$Be+$n$ channel. Contrary to earlier stable beam fragmentation
studies which identified this as a strongly interacting $s$-wave virtual state
in $^{13}$Be, analysis here of the $^{12}$Be+$n$+$n$ events demonstrated that
this was an artifact resulting from the sequential-decay of the
$^{14}$Be(2$^+$) state. Single-proton removal from $^{14}$B was found to
populate a broad low-lying structure some 0.70 MeV above the neutron-decay
threshold in addition to a less prominent feature at around 2.4 MeV. Based on
the selectivity of the reaction and a comparison with (0-3)$\hbar\omega$

arise from closely spaced J$^\pi$=1/2$^+$ and 5/2$^+$ resonances
(E$_r$=0.40$\pm$0.03 and 0.85$^{+0.15}_{-0.11}$ MeV), whilst the broad
higher-lying feature is a second 5/2$^+$ level (E$_r$=2.35$\pm$0.14 MeV). Taken
in conjunction with earlier studies, it would appear that the lowest 1/2$^+$

analysis of the economic income data descending from different databases. To
explain our approach, we introduce the necessary theoretical background, the
extended Yakovenko et al. (EY) model. This model gives an analytical
description of the annual household incomes of all society classes in the
European Union (i.e., the low-, medium-, and high-income ones) by a single
unified formula based on unified formalism. We show that the EY model is very
useful for the analyses of various income datasets, in particular, in the case
of a smooth matching of two different datasets. The completed database which we
have constructed using this matching emphasises the significance of the
high-income society class in the analysis of all household incomes. For
instance, the Pareto exponent, which characterises this class, defines the Zipf
law having an exponent much lower than the one characterising the medium-income
society class. This result makes it possible to clearly distinguish between
medium- and high-income society classes. By using our approach, we found that
the high-income society class almost disappeared in 2009, which defines this
year as the most difficult for the EU. To our surprise, this is a contrast with
2008, considered the first year of a worldwide financial crisis, when the
status of the high-income society class was similar to that of 2010. This,
perhaps, emphasises that the crisis in the EU was postponed by about one year
in comparison with the United States.

health equity, eliminate disparities, and improve the health of all groups. In
health disparity indices (HDIs) such as the mean log deviation (MLD) and Theil
index (TI), disparities are relative to the population average, whereas in the
index of disparity (IDisp) the reference is the group with the least adverse
health outcome. Although the latter may be preferable, identification of a
reference group can be affected by statistical reliability. To address this
issue, we propose a new HDI, the R\'{e}nyi index (RI), which is
reference-invariant. When standardized, the RI extends the Atkinson index,
where a disparity aversion parameter can incorporate societal values associated
with health equity. In addition, both the MLD and TI are limiting cases of the
RI. Also, a symmetrized R\'{e}nyi index (SRI) can be constructed, resulting in
a symmetric measure in the two distributions whose relative entropy is being
evaluated. We discuss alternative symmetric and reference-invariant HDIs
derived from the generalized entropy (GE) class and the Bregman divergence, and
argue that the SRI is more robust than its GE-based counterpart to small
changes in the distribution of the adverse health outcome. We evaluate the
design-based standard errors and bootstrapped sampling distributions for the
SRI, and illustrate the proposed methodology using data from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) on the 2001-04 prevalence of
moderate or severe periodontitis among adults aged 45-74, which track Oral

experience the event of interest if it is observed for a sufficient long time.
However, one can explicitly assume that an unknown proportion of the population
under study will never experience the monitored event. The promotion time
model, which has a biological motivation, is one of the survival models taking
this feature into account. The promotion time model assumes that the failure
time of each subject is generated by the minimum of N latent event times which
are independent with a common distribution independent of N. We propose an
extension which allows the covariates to influence simultaneously the
probability of being cured and the latent distribution. We estimate the latent
distribution using a flexible Cox proportional hazard model where the logarithm
of the baseline hazard function is specified using Bayesian P-splines.
Introducing covariates in the latent distribution implies that the population
hazard function might not have a proportional hazard structure. However, the
use of the P-splines provides a smooth estimation of the population hazard
ratio over time. We propose a restricted use of the model when the follow up of
the study is not sufficiently long. A simulation study evaluating the accuracy
of our methodology is presented. The proposed model is illustrated on data from

an analysis, (2) model development and (3) software design. Moreover, a
unified, clear and understandable framework for model representation lowers the
barrier for beginners and non-specialists to grasp complex phylogenetic models,
including their assumptions and parameter/variable dependencies.
  Graphical modeling is a unifying framework that has gained in popularity in
the statistical literature in recent years. The core idea is to break complex
models into conditionally independent distributions. The strength lies in the
comprehensibility, flexibility, and adaptability of this formalism, and the
large body of computational work based on it. Graphical models are well-suited
to teach statistical models, to facilitate communication among phylogeneticists
and in the development of generic software for simulation and statistical
inference.
  Here, we provide an introduction to graphical models for phylogeneticists and
extend the standard graphical model representation to the realm of
phylogenetics. We introduce a new graphical model component, tree plates, to
capture the changing structure of the subgraph corresponding to a phylogenetic
tree. We describe a range of phylogenetic models using the graphical model
framework and introduce modules to simplify the representation of standard
components in large and complex models. Phylogenetic model graphs can be
readily used in simulation, maximum likelihood inference, and Bayesian
inference using, for example, Metropolis-Hastings or Gibbs sampling of the

3521 observed with the VLA as part of The HI Nearby Galaxy Survey. Clearly
evident in the HI data cube is the presence of an anomalous HI component that
is both diffuse and slow-rotating. The data cube is dynamically decomposed into
regular and anomalous HI components. A mass of M_HI=1.5 x 10^9 Msun is
estimated for the anomalous HI - 20 per cent of the total HI mass. Standard HI
data products and rotation curves are produced for each dynamical component. In
terms of circular rotation speed, the anomalous HI is found to lag the regular
HI by ~25 - 125 km/s. Three-dimensional models are generated and used to
determine the possible location of the anomalous HI. The results strongly
suggest it to be distributed in a thick disc with a scale-height of a few kpc
(~3.5 kpc). It is concluded that the anomalous HI in NGC 3521 constitutes a
slow-rotating halo gas component, consistent with similar findings for other
nearby galaxies. A study of the radial distribution of the anomalous HI shows
it to be spatially coincident with the inner regions of the stellar disc where
the star formation rate is highest. It is most likely a galactic fountain that
has deposited gas from the disc of the galaxy into the halo.

but due to the complexity of these experiments, there are currently no standard
methods for sample size estimation in metabolomics. Since pilot studies are
rarely done in metabolomics, currently existing sample size estimation
approaches which rely on pilot data can not be applied.
  Results: In this article, an analysis based approach called MetSizeR is
developed to estimate sample size for metabolomic experiments even when
experimental pilot data are not available. The key motivation for MetSizeR is
that it considers the type of analysis the researcher intends to use for data
analysis when estimating sample size. MetSizeR uses information about the data
analysis technique and prior expert knowledge of the metabolomic experiment to
simulate pilot data from a statistical model. Permutation based techniques are
then applied to the simulated pilot data to estimate the required sample size.
  Conclusions: The MetSizeR methodology, and a publicly available software
package which implements the approach, are illustrated through real metabolomic
applications. Sample size estimates, informed by the intended statistical
analysis technique, and the associated uncertainty are provided.

Many interaction rules are analyzed, including distinct cluster annihilations
and a modified version of the original pair contact process (PCP). Through
detailed time dependent numerical simulations we find that for our modified
models, the phase transitions are of first-order, hence contrasting with their
corresponding usual formulations in the literature, which are of second-order.
By calculating the order-parameter distributions, the obtained bimodal shapes
as well as the finite scale analysis reinforce coexisting phases, so a
discontinuous transition. These findings strongly suggest that above particle
creation requirements constitute a minimum and fundamental mechanism
determining the phase coexistence in short-range contact processes.

Methods. We combine optical laser interference and extended effective medium
approximations (EMAs) to measure the porosity of three astrophysically relevant
ice mixtures: H2O:CO2=10:1, 4:1, and 2:1. Infrared spectroscopy is used as a
benchmarking test of this new laboratory-based method. Results. By
independently monitoring the O-H dangling modes of the different water-rich ice
mixtures, we confirm the porosities predicted by the extended EMAs. We also
demonstrate that CO2 premixed with water in the gas phase does not
significantly affect the ice morphology during omni-directional deposition, as
long as the physical conditions favourable to segregation are not reached. We
propose a mechanism in which CO2 molecules diffuse on the surface of the
growing ice sample prior to being incorporated into the bulk and then fill the
pores partly or completely, depending on the relative abundance and the growth
temperature.

factorize a tensor into a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient and a reduced tensor. In
addition, the fermion signs have to be carefully tracked. Because of these
challenges, implementing DMRG efficiently for QC is not straightforward.
Efficient and freely available implementations are therefore highly desired. In
this work we present CheMPS2, our free open-source spin-adapted implementation
of DMRG for ab initio QC. Around CheMPS2, we have implemented the augmented
Hessian Newton-Raphson complete active space self-consistent field method, with
exact Hessian. The bond dissociation curves of the 12 lowest states of the
carbon dimer were obtained at the DMRG(28 orbitals, 12 electrons,
D$_{\mathsf{SU(2)}}$=2500)/cc-pVDZ level of theory. The contribution of $1s$
core correlation to the $X^1\Sigma_g^+$ bond dissociation curve of the carbon
dimer was estimated by comparing energies at the DMRG(36o, 12e,
D$_{\mathsf{SU(2)}}$=2500)/cc-pCVDZ and DMRG-SCF(34o, 8e,

and host galaxy using point spread function and Sersic models. The systematic
errors in the measured galaxy absolute magnitudes and colors are estimated to
be less than 0.5 mag and 0.1 mag, respectively, with simulated quasar images.
The effect of quasar light scattered by the interstellar medium is also
carefully addressed. The measured quasar-to-galaxy ratio in total flux
decreases toward longer wavelengths, from ~8 in the u band to ~1 in the i and z
bands. We find that the SDSS quasars are hosted exclusively by massive galaxies
(stellar mass Mstar > 10^{10} Msun), which is consistent with previous results
for less luminous narrow-line (obscured) active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The
quasar hosts are very blue and almost absent on the red sequence, showing stark
contrast to the color-magnitude distribution of normal galaxies. The fact that
more powerful AGNs reside in galaxies with higher star-formation efficiency may
indicate that negative AGN feedback, if it exists, is not concurrent with the
most luminous phase of AGNs. We also find positive correlation between the mass
of supermassive black holes (SMBHs; Mbh) and host stellar mass, but the Mbh -
Mstar relation is offset toward large Mbh or small Mstar compared to the local
relation. While this could indicate that SMBHs grow earlier than do their host
galaxies, such an argument is not conclusive, as the effect may be dominated by
observational biases.

infinitely degenerate family of quasiclassical phases (for $\kappa >

(probably) the ""doubled N\'{e}el"" (or N\'{e}el$^{\ast}$) state. By contrast,
none of this family survives quantum fluctuations to form a stable GS phase in

> \kappa_{c_{2}}$ the quasiclassical (N\'{e}el$^{\ast}$) ordering melts and a
nonclassical phase appears, which, on the basis of preliminary evidence,
appears unlikely to have crossed-dimer valence-bond crystalline (CDVBC)
ordering, as in the spin-1/2 case. Unlike in the spin-1/2 case, where the
N\'{e}el and CDVBC phases are separated by a phase with plaquette valence-bond

Analysis of counts by Gaussian regression models ignores the discreteness,

standard errors or possibily negative predictions of the expected number of
events. The Poisson regression is the standard model for count data with
underlying assumptions on the generating process which may be implausible in
many applications. Statisticians have long recognized the limitation of
imposing equidispersion under the Poisson regression model. A typical situation
is when the conditional variance exceeds the conditional mean, in which case
models allowing for overdispersion are routinely used. Less reported is the
case of underdispersion with fewer modelling alternatives and assessments
available in the literature. One of such alternatives, the Gamma-count model,
is adopted here in the analysis of an agronomic experiment designed to
investigate the effect of levels of defoliation on different phenological
states upon the number of cotton bolls. Results show improvements over the
Poisson model and the semiparametric quasi-Poisson model in capturing the
observed variability in the data. Estimating rather than assuming the
underlying variance process lead to important insights into the process.

kinetic models that follow closely from existing literature are reviewed and
two new first-principle models are presented and compared with results from
direct numerical simulation. One model investigates the effect of regions of
strong localized shear, which are generic to stellarator equilibria. These
""shear spikes"" are found to have a potentially significant stabilizing affect
on the mode; however, the effect is strongest at short wavelengths
perpendicular to the magnetic field, and it is found to be significant only for
the fastest growing modes in W7-X. A second model investigates the
long-wavelength limit for the case of negligible global magnetic shear. The
analytic calculation reveals that the effect of the curvature drive enters at
second order in the drift frequency, confirming conventional wisdom that the
ITG mode is slab-like at long wavelengths. Using flux tube simulations of a
zero-shear W7-X configuration, we observe a close relationship to an
axisymmetric configuration at a similar parameter point. It is concluded that
scale lengths of the equilibrium gradients constitute a good parameter space to
characterize the ITG mode. Thus, to optimize the magnetic geometry for ITG mode
stability, it may be fruitful to focus on local parameters, such as the
magnitude of bad curvature, connection length, and local shear at locations of
bad curvature (where the ITG mode amplitude peaks).

systems with mass numbers $A\approx (m_{\rm Planck}/m_n)^3$ or mass $M_{\rm
core}\approx M_{\odot}$, where $m_{\rm Planck}$ and $m_n$ are the Planck and
the nucleon mass. For $T \ll m_e c^2/k_B \approx 5.9\times 10^9$ K, a family of
equilibrium configurations can be obtained with analytic solutions of the
ultra-relativistic Thomas-Fermi equation at finite temperatures. Such
configurations fulfill global but not local charge neutrality and have strong
electric fields on the core surface. We find that the maximum electric field at
the core surface is enhanced at finite temperatures with respect to the
degenerate case.

investigated the properties of a streamer observed on October 20-21, 2010 by

comprising the Fe ix - Fe xi lines, the streamer was detected to a distance of
2Rsun. We assume that the EUV emission is dominated by collisional excitation
and resonant scattering of monochromatic radiation coming from the underlying
corona. Below 1.2Rsun, the plasma density and temperature were derived from the
Hinode/EIS data by a line-ratio method. Plasma conditions in the streamer and
in the background corona above 1.2Rsun from disk center were determined by
forward-modeling the emission that best fit the observational data in both EUV
and white light. It was found that plasma in the streamer above 1.2Rsun is
nearly isothermal, with a temperature T=1.43+-0.08 MK. The hydrostatic
scale-height temperature determined from the evaluated density distribution was
significantly higher (1.72+-0.08 MK), which suggests the existence of outward
plasma flow along the streamer. We conclude that, inside the streamer,
collisional excitation provided more than 90% of the observed EUV emission;
whereas, in the background corona, the contribution of resonance scattering
became comparable with that of collisions at R > 2Rsun.

distribution of matter in the universe, yet it is frequently overlooked due to
the fact that its signal to noise is smaller than that of lensing shear.
Because its systematic errors are quite different from those of shear,
magnification is nevertheless an important approach with which to study the
distribution of large scale structure. We present lensing mass profiles of
spectroscopic luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and galaxy clusters determined
through measurements of the weak lensing magnification of photometric LRGs in
their background. We measure the change in detected galaxy counts as well as
the increased average galaxy flux behind the lenses. In addition, we examine
the average change in source color due to extinction by dust in the lenses. By
simultaneously fitting these three probes we constrain the mass profiles and
dust-to-mass ratios of the lenses in six bins of lens richness. For each
richness bin we fit an NFW halo mass, brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) mass,
second halo term, and dust-to-mass ratio. The resulting mass-richness relation
is consistent with previous analyses of the catalogs, and limits on the
dust-to-mass ratio in the lenses are in agreement with expectations. We explore
the effects of including the (low signal-to-noise) flux magnification and
reddening measurements in the analysis compared to using only the counts
magnification data; the additional probes significantly improve the agreement
between our measured mass-richness relation and previous results.

between distance and Fuzzy (proximity or strength) graphs. Distinct transitive
closures in Fuzzy graphs lead to closures of their isomorphic distance graphs
with widely different structural properties. For instance, the All Pairs
Shortest Paths (APSP) problem, based on the Dijkstra algorithm, is equivalent
to a metric closure, which is only one of the possible ways to calculate
shortest paths. Understanding and mapping this isomorphism is necessary to
analyse models of complex networks based on weighted graphs. Any conclusions
derived from such models should take into account the distortions imposed on
graph topology when converting proximity/strength into distance graphs, to
subsequently compute path length and shortest path measures. We characterise
the isomorphism using the max-min and Dombi disjunction/conjunction pairs. This
allows us to: (1) study alternative distance closures, such as those based on
diffusion, metric, and ultra-metric distances; (2) identify the operators
closest to the metric closure of distance graphs (the APSP), but which are
logically consistent; and (3) propose a simple method to compute alternative
distance closures using existing algorithms for the APSP. In particular, we
show that a specific diffusion distance is promising for community detection in
complex networks, and is based on desirable axioms for logical inference or
approximate reasoning on networks; it also provides a simple algebraic means to
compute diffusion processes on networks. Based on these results, we argue that
choosing different distance closures can lead to different conclusions about
indirect associations on network data, as well as the structure of complex
networks, and are thus important to consider.

quantities. The boundary integral equations derived in this paper in the
imperfect interface setting show a weak singularity, in contrast to the perfect
interface case, where the kernel is of the Cauchy type. We further present
three alternative variants of the boundary integral equations which offer
computationally favourable alternatives for certain sets of parameters.

charging time is presented. The proposed scheme employs the intermediated
energy storage (IES) circuit which consists of a constant power driving circuit
and a super-capacitor. By utilizing the characteristic of high power density of
the super-capacitor, the receiver can receive and store the energy in short
duration and supply to the battery for long time. This enables the overlap of
charging duration between all receivers. As a result, the overall charging time
can be reduced.

  text overlap with arXiv:1309.6484",,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The control of a network of signalized intersections is considered. Previous
works proposed a feedback control belonging to the family of the so-called
back-pressure controls that ensures provably maximum stability given
pre-specified routing probabilities. However, this optimal back-pressure
controller (BP*) requires routing rates and a measure of the number of vehicles
queuing at a node for each possible routing decision. It is an idealistic
assumption for our application since vehicles (going straight, turning
left/right) are all gathered in the same lane apart from the proximity of the
intersection and cameras can only give estimations of the aggregated queue
length. In this paper, we present a back-pressure traffic signal controller
(BP) that does not require routing rates, it requires only aggregated queue
lengths estimation (without direction information) and loop detectors at the
stop line for each possible direction. A theoretical result on the Lyapunov
drift in heavy load conditions under BP control is provided and tends to
indicate that BP should have good stability properties. Simulations confirm
this and show that BP stabilizes the queuing network in a significant part of
the capacity region.

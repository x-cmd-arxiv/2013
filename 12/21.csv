screening distance of a quark-antiquark pair, its free energy, and the running
coupling. These observables show a certain insensitivity as to which model and

project at a large university. We studied an attempt at introducing materials
and instructional methods informed by physics education research (PER-informed
materials) into a department where most instruction has been traditional and a
significant number of faculty are hesitant, ambivalent or even resistant about
the introduction of such reforms. The changes were made in the laboratories and
recitation sections of the introductory classes, both calculus-based and
algebra-based, introducing PER-informed materials and training the teaching
assistants in student-centered instructional methods. In addition to the
results found in the large lecture classes, we present the results of a small
PER-informed, inquiry-based, laboratory-based class that has been taught as a
special section of the algebra-based course for about 10 years. The assessment
reported in this paper was done using available PER-developed assessment
instruments. The results of other assessment instruments used in the project,
such as free-response pre- and post-tests, are reported in subsequent papers.
The results in this paper inform researchers in PER of the use of PER-informed
materials and instructional methods in a department not unified in the
introduction and implementation of these materials and the results of the
implementation as assessed by PER-based conceptual inventories. We found that
our conceptual inventory scores were lower than many results reported elsewhere
in the literature. However, we did see a statistically significant increase in
the conceptual inventory scores with the implementation of PER-informed
laboratories and the use of student-centered pedagogy in the labs and
recitations. The increase was much greater, if the lecture instructor also used
PER-informed materials.

this paper we however show empirically that CD has a lower stochastic gradient

approach to study transient dynamics in time-dependent quantum transport
through molecular junctions. A key feature of the approach is that it provides
a closed integral expression for the time-dependence of the density matrix of
the molecular junction after switch-on of a bias or gate potential which can be
evaluated without the necessity of propagating individual single-particle
orbitals. This allows for the study of time-dependent transport in large
molecular systems coupled to wide band leads. As an application of the
formalism we study the transient dynamics of zigzag and armchair graphene
nanoribbons of different symmetries. We find that the transient times can
exceed several hundreds of femtoseconds while displaying a long time
oscillatory motion related to multiple reflections of the density wave in the
nanoribbons at the ribbon--lead interface. This temporal profile has a shape
that scales with the length of the ribbons and is modulated by fast
oscillations described by intra-ribbon and ribbon--lead transitions. Especially
in the armchair nanoribbons there exists a sequence of quasi-stationary states
related to reflections at the edge state located at the ribbon--lead interface.
In the case of zigzag nanoribbons there is a predominant oscillation frequency
associated with virtual transitions between the edge states and the Fermi
levels of the electrode. We further study the local bond currents in the
nanoribbons and find that the parity of the edges strongly affects the path of
the electrons in the nanoribbons. We finally study the behavior of the
transients for various added gate potentials.

due to Bragg reflection form within the volume plasmonic band. When a cavity

detected via gravitational waves is a central one for future observations with
the ground-based network of gravitational-wave laser interferometers, such as
Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. Different techniques for sky localisation
have been independently developed. They can be divided in two broad categories:
fully coherent Bayesian techniques, which are high-latency and aimed at
in-depth studies of all the parameters of a source, including sky position, and
""triangulation-based"" techniques, which exploit the data products from the
search stage of the analysis to provide an almost real-time approximation of
the posterior probability density function of the sky location of a detection
candidate. These techniques have previously been applied to data collected
during the last science runs of gravitational-wave detectors operating in the
so-called initial configuration.
  Here, we develop and analyse methods for assessing the self-consistency of
parameter estimation methods and carrying out fair comparisons between
different algorithms, addressing issues of efficiency and optimality. These
methods are general, and can be applied to parameter estimation problems other
than sky localisation. We apply these methods to two existing sky localisation
techniques representing the two above-mentioned categories, using a set of
simulated inspiral-only signals from compact binary systems with total mass
$\le 20\,M_\odot$ and non-spinning components. We compare the relative
advantages and costs of the two techniques and show that sky location
uncertainties are on average a factor $\approx 20$ smaller for fully coherent
techniques than for the specific variant of the ""triangulation-based"" technique

have proposed High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes and High Occupancy Tolling
(HOT) lanes to promote car pooling. However, enforcement of the rules of these
lanes is currently performed by roadside enforcement officers using visual
observation. Manual roadside enforcement is known to be inefficient, costly,
potentially dangerous, and ultimately ineffective. Violation rates up to
50%-80% have been reported, while manual enforcement rates of less than 10% are
typical. Therefore, there is a need for automated vehicle occupancy detection
to support HOV/HOT lane enforcement. A key component of determining vehicle
occupancy is to determine whether or not the vehicle's front passenger seat is
occupied. In this paper, we examine two methods of determining vehicle front
seat occupancy using a near infrared (NIR) camera system pointed at the
vehicle's front windshield. The first method examines a state-of-the-art
deformable part model (DPM) based face detection system that is robust to
facial pose. The second method examines state-of- the-art local aggregation
based image classification using bag-of-visual-words (BOW) and Fisher vectors
(FV). A dataset of 3000 images was collected on a public roadway and is used to
perform the comparison. From these experiments it is clear that the image
classification approach is superior for this problem.

analyzing and understanding the architecture of an RNN, however, we find three
points of an RNN which may be made deeper; (1) input-to-hidden function, (2)
hidden-to-hidden transition and (3) hidden-to-output function. Based on this
observation, we propose two novel architectures of a deep RNN which are
orthogonal to an earlier attempt of stacking multiple recurrent layers to build
a deep RNN (Schmidhuber, 1992; El Hihi and Bengio, 1996). We provide an
alternative interpretation of these deep RNNs using a novel framework based on
neural operators. The proposed deep RNNs are empirically evaluated on the tasks
of polyphonic music prediction and language modeling. The experimental result
supports our claim that the proposed deep RNNs benefit from the depth and
outperform the conventional, shallow RNNs.

with the gravitation of these components we conduct thought experiments on
gravity, analogous to the real experiments that our forebears conducted on
electricity. By analogy to the forces due to electric currents we investigate
the gravitational forces due to the flows of momentum, angular momentum, and
energy along a cylinder. Under tension the gravity of the cylinder decreases
but the 'closure' of the 3-space around it increases. When the cylinder carries
a torque the flow of angular momentum along it leads to a novel helical
interpretation of Levi-Civita's external metric and a novel relativistic
effect. Energy currents give gravomagnetic effects in which parallel currents
repel and antiparallel currents attract, though such effects must be added to
those of static gravity. The gravity of beams of light give striking
illustrations of these effects and a re-derivation of light bending via the

(CT) which is at an ultra-low-dose for developing countries, especially in
rural areas. Methods: The proposed scheme is inspired by the recently developed
compressive sensing and interior tomography techniques, where the data
acquisition system targets a region of interest (ROI) to acquire limited and
truncated data. The source and detector are translated in opposite directions
for either ROI reconstruction with one or more localized linear scans or global
reconstruction by combining multiple ROI reconstructions. In other words, the
popular slip ring is replaced by a translation based setup, and the
instrumentation cost is reduced by a relaxation of the imaging speed
requirement. Results: The various translational scanning modes are
theoretically analyzed, and the scanning parameters are optimized. The
numerical simulation results from different numbers of linear scans confirm the
feasibility of the proposed scheme, and suggest two preferred low-end systems
for horizontal and vertical patient positions respectively. Conclusion:
Ultra-low-cost x-ray CT is feasible with our proposed combination of linear
scanning, compressive sensing, and interior tomography. The proposed
architecture can be tailored into permanent, movable, or reconfigurable systems
as desirable. Advanced image registration and spectral imaging features can be
included as well.

quantification in subsurface flows associated with radioactive waste disposal
studies. We consider single phase flow problems in random porous media

introduced by a finite element discretisation of these problems. In contrast to
several recent works on the analysis of standard nodal finite element
discretisations, we consider here mass-conservative lowest order Raviart-Thomas
mixed finite elements. This is very important since local mass conservation is
highly desirable in realistic groundwater flow problems. Due to the limited
spatial regularity and the lack of uniform ellipticity and boundedness of the
operator the analysis is non-trivial in the presence of lognormal random
fields. We establish finite element error bounds for Darcy velocity and
pressure, as well as for a more accurate recovered pressure approximation. We
then apply the error bounds to prove convergence of the multilevel Monte Carlo
algorithm for estimating statistics of these quantities. Moreover, we prove
convergence for a class of bounded, linear functionals of the Darcy velocity.
An important special case is the approximation of the effective permeability in
a 2D flow cell. We perform numerical experiments to confirm the convergence
results.

the nonlinear sigma model of quantum field theory. There recently has been
interest in the second order approximation of this flow, called the RG-2 flow,

existence and uniqueness results in all dimensions if the sectional curvatures
$K_{ij}$ satisfy certain inequalities; the calculation of fixed points for $n =

Lambert W function; a classification of the solutions that evolve only by

Extensions to several variables and to certain sets of Lebesgue measure zero,
massive in a much weaker sense, are available.
  Still, given a subset $Z\subset [-1,1]^n\subset {\mathbb R}^n$ it is not easy
to determine whether it is ${\mathcal P}_d({\mathbb R}^n)$-norming (here
${\mathcal P}_d({\mathbb R}^n)$ is the space of real polynomials of degree at
most $d$ on ${\mathbb R}^n$), i.e. satisfies a Remez-type inequality:
$\sup_{[-1,1]^n}|P|\le C\sup_{Z}|P|$ for all $P\in {\mathcal P}_d({\mathbb

hypersurface of degree $d$ in ${\mathbb R}^n$, there are many apparently
unrelated reasons for $Z \subset [-1,1]^n$ to have this property.)

continuous functions on $[-1,1]^n$, remaining in most of the examples in the

non-trivial examples. Next, we extend the Turan-Nazarov inequality for
exponential polynomials to several variables, and on this base prove a new
fewnomial Remez-type inequality. Finally, we study the family of optimal

However, a key limitation of the above attack is that it is intrusive,
requiring user cooperation, and is thus easily detectable and can be reported
to other users. In this paper, we identify and analyze a more serious threat
for users of BCI devices. We propose a it subliminal attack in which the victim
is attacked at the levels below his cognitive perception. Our attack involves
exposing the victim to visual stimuli for a duration of 13.3 milliseconds -- a
duration usually not sufficient for conscious perception. The attacker analyzes
subliminal brain activity in response to these short visual stimuli to infer
private information about the user. If carried out carefully, for example by
hiding the visual stimuli within screen content that the user expects to see,
the attack may remain undetected. As a consequence, the attacker can scale it
to many victims and expose them to the attack for a long time. We
experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of our subliminal attack via a
proof-of-concept study carried out with 27 subjects. We conducted experiments
on users wearing Electroencephalography-based BCI devices, and used portrait
pictures of people as visual stimuli which were embedded within the background
of an innocuous video for a time duration not exceeding 13.3 milliseconds. Our

hypothesized by noting that the time of appearance of the streamers is
substantially larger than the viscoelastic relaxation time scale of the
biofilms, and this appearance is explained by the inability of a viscous liquid
to withstand an external shear. Further, by identifying the post formation
dynamics of the streamers as that of a viscous liquid jet in a surrounding flow

relativistic Boltzmann equation for the parton distribution function tuned at a
fixed shear viscosity to entropy density ratio $\eta/s$. Our main goal is to
put emphasis on the role of a saturation scale in the initial gluon spectrum,
which makes the initial distribution far from a thermalized one. We find that
the presence of the saturation scale reduces the efficiency in building-up the
elliptic flow, even if the thermalization process is quite fast $\tau_{therm}
\approx 0.8 \,\rm fm/c$ and the pressure isotropization even faster
$\tau_{isotr} \approx 0.3 \,\rm fm/c$. The impact of the non-equilibrium
implied by the saturation scale manifests for non-central collisions and can
modify the estimate of the viscosity respect to the assumption of full
thermalization in $p_T$-space. We find that the estimate of $\eta/s$ is
modified from $\eta/s \approx 2/4\pi$ to $\eta/s \approx 1/4\pi$ at RHIC and
from $\eta/s \approx 3/4\pi$ to $\eta/s \approx 2/4\pi$ at LHC. We complete our
investigation by a study of the thermalization and isotropization times of the
fireball for different initial conditions and values of $\eta/s$ showing how
the latter affects both isotropization and thermalization. Lastly, we have seen
that the range of values explored by the phase-space distribution function $f$

to extract cohesive structures in network representations of brain connectivity
using multi-resolution techniques. We employ a combination of soft
thresholding, windowed thresholding, and resolution in community detection,
that enable us to identify and isolate structures associated with different
weights. One such mesoscale structure is bipartivity, which quantifies the
extent to which the brain is divided into two partitions with high connectivity
between partitions and low connectivity within partitions. A second,
complementary mesoscale structure is modularity, which quantifies the extent to
which the brain is divided into multiple communities with strong connectivity
within each community and weak connectivity between communities. Our methods
lead to multi-resolution curves of these network diagnostics over a range of
spatial, geometric, and structural scales. For statistical comparison, we
contrast our results with those obtained for several benchmark null models. Our
work demonstrates that multi-resolution diagnostic curves capture complex
organizational profiles in weighted graphs. We apply these methods to the

processing, such as the retina, V1, V2, etc. Understanding the functional roles
of these visual processing layers would help to integrate the
psychophysiological and neurophysiological models into a consistent theory of
human vision, and would also provide insights to computer vision research. One
classical theory of the early visual pathway hypothesizes that it serves to
capture the statistical structure of the visual inputs by efficiently coding
the visual information in its outputs. Until recently, most computational
models following this theory have focused upon explaining the receptive field
properties of one or two visual layers. Recent work in deep networks has
eliminated this concern, however, there is till the retinal layer to consider.
Here we improve on a previously-described hierarchical model Recursive ICA
(RICA) [1] which starts with PCA, followed by a layer of sparse coding or ICA,
followed by a component-wise nonlinearity derived from considerations of the
variable distributions expected by ICA. This process is then repeated. In this
work, we improve on this model by using a new version of sparse PCA (sPCA),
which results in biologically-plausible receptive fields for both the sPCA and
ICA/sparse coding. When applied to natural image patches, our model learns
visual features exhibiting the receptive field properties of retinal ganglion
cells/lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) cells, V1 simple cells, V1 complex
cells, and V2 cells. Our work provides predictions for experimental

apply it to synthetic distorted text from reCAPTCHA. reCAPTCHA is one of the

a well-established experimental fact, its origin remains controversial. Nematic
order breaks the discrete lattice rotational symmetry by making the $x$ and $y$
directions in the Fe plane non-equivalent. This can happen because of (i) a
tetragonal to orthorhombic structural transition, (ii) a spontaneous breaking
of an orbital symmetry, or (iii) a spontaneous development of an Ising-type
spin-nematic order - a magnetic state that breaks rotational symmetry but
preserves time-reversal symmetry. The Landau theory of phase transitions
dictates that the development of one of these orders should immediately induce
the other two, making the origin of nematicity a physics realization of a
""chicken and egg problem"". The three scenarios are, however, quite different
from a microscopic perspective. While in the structural scenario lattice
vibrations (phonons) play the dominant role, in the other two scenarios
electronic correlations are responsible for the nematic order. In this review,
we argue that experimental and theoretical evidence strongly points to the
electronic rather than phononic mechanism, placing the nematic order in the
class of correlation-driven electronic instabilities, like superconductivity
and density-wave transitions. We discuss different microscopic models for
nematicity in the iron pnictides, and link nematicity to other ordered states
of the global phase diagram of these materials -- magnetism and
superconductivity. In the magnetic model nematic order pre-empts stripe-type

the geometry representation, in contrast with depth coding, which directly
compresses with losses the original geometry signal. We present the principles

facilitate the learning of a detector for a target class. As we show in our
experiments, this transfer is not only beneficial for detectors based on
basic-level category representations, but also enables the robust learning of
detectors that represent classes at finer levels of granularity, where training
data is typically even scarcer and more unbalanced. As a result, we report
largely improved performance in simultaneous 2D object localization and
viewpoint estimation on a recent dataset of challenging street scenes.

have more complicated satisfaction patterns in the lattice of Herbrand
interpretations than traditional, simple atoms. In this paper we refer to any
of these constructs as generalized atoms. Several semantics with differing
characteristics have been proposed for these extensions, rendering the big
picture somewhat blurry. In this paper, we analyze the class of programs that
have convex generalized atoms (originally proposed by Liu and Truszczynski in
[10]) in rule bodies and show that for this class many of the proposed
semantics coincide. This is an interesting result, since recently it has been
shown that this class is the precise complexity boundary for the FLP semantics.
We investigate whether similar results also hold for other semantics, and
discuss the implications of our findings.

to the growing body of work contrasting the representational power of deep and
shallow network architectures. In particular, we offer a framework for
comparing deep and shallow models that belong to the family of piecewise linear
functions based on computational geometry. We look at a deep rectifier
multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with linear outputs units and compare it with a
single layer version of the model. In the asymptotic regime, when the number of
inputs stays constant, if the shallow model has $kn$ hidden units and $n_0$
inputs, then the number of linear regions is $O(k^{n_0}n^{n_0})$. For a $k$
layer model with $n$ hidden units on each layer it is $\Omega(\left\lfloor
{n}/{n_0}\right\rfloor^{k-1}n^{n_0})$. The number
$\left\lfloor{n}/{n_0}\right\rfloor^{k-1}$ grows faster than $k^{n_0}$ when $n$
tends to infinity or when $k$ tends to infinity and $n \geq 2n_0$.
Additionally, even when $k$ is small, if we restrict $n$ to be $2n_0$, we can
show that a deep model has considerably more linear regions that a shallow one.
We consider this as a first step towards understanding the complexity of these
models and specifically towards providing suitable mathematical tools for
future analysis.

motion resonances. Once in resonance, the planets' eccentricities grow to an
equilibrium value that depends on the ratio of migration time scale to the
eccentricity damping timescale, $K=\tau_a/\tau_e$, with higher values of
equilibrium eccentricity for lower values of $K$. For low equilibrium
eccentricities, $e_{eq}\propto K^{-1/2}$. The stability of a planet pair
depends on eccentricity so the system can become unstable before it reaches its
equilibrium eccentricity. Using a resonant overlap criterion that takes into
account the role of first and second order resonances and depends on
eccentricity, we find a function $K_{min}(\mu_p, j)$ that defines the lowest
value for $K$, as a function of the ratio of total planet mass to stellar mass
($\mu_p$) and the period ratio of the resonance defined as $P_1/P_2=j/(j+k)$,
that allows two convergently migrating planets to remain stable in resonance at
their equilibrium eccentricities. We scaled the functions $K_{min}$ for each
resonance of the same order into a single function $K_c$. The function $K_{c}$
for planet pairs in first order resonances is linear with increasing planet
mass and quadratic for pairs in second order resonances with a coefficient
depending on the relative migration rate and strongly on the planet to planet
mass ratio. The linear relation continues until the mass approaches a critical
mass defined by the 2/7 resonance overlap instability law and $K_c \to \infty$.
We compared our analytic boundary with an observed sample of resonant two
planet systems. All but one of the first order resonant planet pair systems
found by radial velocity measurements are well inside the stability region
estimated by this model. We calculated $K_c$ for Kepler systems without
well-constrained eccentricities and found only weak constraints on $K$.

decoding of the inner code with inner decoding failure generating erasure
symbols for the outer Raptor code. Raptor codes allow low-complexity decoding
of very long codewords while providing capacity- approaching performance for
erasure channels. For the off-line page recovery scheme, one whole NAND block
forms a Raptor codeword with each inner codeword typically made up of several
Raptor symbols. An efficient look-up-table strategy is devised for Raptor
encoding and decoding which avoids using large buffers in the controller
despite the substantial size of the Raptor code employed. The potential
performance benefit of the proposed scheme is evaluated in terms of the
probability of block recovery conditioned on the presence of uncorrectable
pages. In the suggested page-error-correction strategy, on the other hand, a
hard-decision-iterating product code is used as the inner code. The specific
product code employed in this work is based on row-column concatenation with
multiple intersecting bits allowing the use of longer component codes. In this
setting the collection of bits captured within each intersection of the
row-column codes acts as the Raptor symbol(s), and the intersections of failed

boost relative to the existing error correcting system based on long

Since the weighted average derivatives do not rely on parametric specifications

$\delta T \approx 100 \mu K$. The comparison of these with previously known
results on search string network shows that strings can only be semilocal in an
amount of $1 \div 5$, with the upper restriction on individual strings tension
(linear density) of $G\mu/c^2 \le 7.36 \cdot 10^{-7}$. The texture model is
also legal. There are no strings with $G\mu/c^2 > 7.36 \cdot 10^{-7}$. However,
comparison with the data for the search of non-Gaussian signals shows that the
presence of several (up to 3) of Nambu-Goto strings is also possible. For
$G\mu/c^2 \le 4.83 \cdot 10^{-7}$ the MHF method is ineffective because of
unverifiable spurious string candidates. Thus the existence of strings with
tensions $G\mu/c^2 \le 4.83 \cdot 10^{-7}$ is not prohibited but it is beyond
the Planck data possibilities.

us to locate a large class of stable theories that violate the null energy

subsets, various models considered so far. Finally, under the assumption that
the true underlying cosmological model is the $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter

recognition (e.g Krizhevsky et al., 2012). However, deep networks are still
outmatched by the power and versatility of the brain, perhaps in part due to
the richer neuronal computations available to cortical circuits. The challenge
is to identify which neuronal mechanisms are relevant, and to find suitable
abstractions to model them. Here, we show how aspects of spike timing, long
hypothesized to play a crucial role in cortical information processing, could
be incorporated into deep networks to build richer, versatile representations.
  We introduce a neural network formulation based on complex-valued neuronal
units that is not only biologically meaningful but also amenable to a variety
of deep learning frameworks. Here, units are attributed both a firing rate and
a phase, the latter indicating properties of spike timing. We show how this
formulation qualitatively captures several aspects thought to be related to
neuronal synchrony, including gating of information processing and dynamic
binding of distributed object representations. Focusing on the latter, we
demonstrate the potential of the approach in several simple experiments. Thus,
neuronal synchrony could be a flexible mechanism that fulfills multiple
functional roles in deep networks.

theoretical understanding of the dynamics of learning in deep neural networks
remains quite sparse. We attempt to bridge the gap between the theory and
practice of deep learning by systematically analyzing learning dynamics for the
restricted case of deep linear neural networks. Despite the linearity of their
input-output map, such networks have nonlinear gradient descent dynamics on
weights that change with the addition of each new hidden layer. We show that
deep linear networks exhibit nonlinear learning phenomena similar to those seen
in simulations of nonlinear networks, including long plateaus followed by rapid
transitions to lower error solutions, and faster convergence from greedy
unsupervised pretraining initial conditions than from random initial
conditions. We provide an analytical description of these phenomena by finding
new exact solutions to the nonlinear dynamics of deep learning. Our theoretical
analysis also reveals the surprising finding that as the depth of a network
approaches infinity, learning speed can nevertheless remain finite: for a
special class of initial conditions on the weights, very deep networks incur
only a finite, depth independent, delay in learning speed relative to shallow
networks. We show that, under certain conditions on the training data,
unsupervised pretraining can find this special class of initial conditions,
while scaled random Gaussian initializations cannot. We further exhibit a new
class of random orthogonal initial conditions on weights that, like
unsupervised pre-training, enjoys depth independent learning times. We further
show that these initial conditions also lead to faithful propagation of
gradients even in deep nonlinear networks, as long as they operate in a special
regime known as the edge of chaos.

new three-dimensional (3D) general relativistic (GR) radiation (R)

GRRMHD simulation of super-Eddington accretion (about $20$ times Eddington)
onto a rapidly rotating BH (dimensionless spin $j=0.9375$) shows sustained
non-axisymmemtric disk turbulence, a persistent electromagnetic jet driven by
the Blandford-Znajek effect, and a total radiative output consistently near the
Eddington rate. The total accretion efficiency is of order $20\%$, the
large-scale electromagnetic jet efficiency is of order $10\%$, and the total
radiative efficiency that reaches large distances remains low at only order
$1\%$. However, the radiation jet and the electromagnetic jet both emerge from
a geometrically beamed polar region, with super-Eddington isotropic equivalent
luminosities. Such simulations with HARMRAD can enlighten the role of BH spin
vs.\ disks in launching jets, help determine the origin of spectral and
temporal states in x-ray binaries, help understand how tidal disruption events
(TDEs) work, provide an accurate horizon-scale flow structure for M87 and other
active galactic nuclei (AGN), and isolate whether AGN feedback is driven by
radiation or by an electromagnetic, thermal, or kinetic wind/jet. For example,
the low radiative efficiency and weak BH spin-down rate from our simulation
suggest that BH growth over cosmological times to billions of solar masses by
redshifts of $z\sim 6-8$ is achievable even with rapidly rotating BHs and ten

Alfv\'enic MHD turbulence in the relativistic limit can be described by
interactions of counter-traveling wave packets. In this paper we numerically
study strong imbalanced MHD turbulence in such environments. Here, imbalanced
turbulence means the waves traveling in one direction (dominant waves) have
higher amplitudes than the opposite-traveling waves (sub-dominant waves). We
find that (1) spectrum of the dominant waves is steeper than that of
sub-dominant waves, (2) the anisotropy of the dominant waves is weaker than
that of sub-dominant waves, and (3) the dependence of the ratio of magnetic
energy densities of dominant and sub-dominant waves on the ratio of energy
injection rates is steeper than quadratic (i.e., \$b_+^2/b_-^2 \propto
(\epsilon_+/\epsilon_-)^n \$ with n>2). These results are consistent with those
obtained for imbalanced non-relativistic Alfv\'enic turbulence. This

on different scales. If there are multiple energy-injection scales, the process
of energy cascade and turbulence dynamo will be different compared with the
case of single energy-injection scale. In this work, we perform
three-dimensional incompressible/compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)

ranges, 2\$\leq k \leq \sqrt{12}\$ (large-scale) and 15 \$\lesssim k \lesssim

changing the amplitude of forcing in the range. We present the time evolution

layers of galaxies in nearby and/or low-mass galaxy clusters. We here present
results from our search for extreme cases of gas-galaxy interactions in much

Brightest Cluster Galaxy. Based on the spatial distribution and orientation of

telescope ever built. This makes it particularly suitable for sensitive
polarimetric observations, as polarimetry is a photon-starved technique.
However, the telescope mirrors may severely limit the polarimetric accuracy of
instruments on the Nasmyth platforms by creating instrumental polarisation
and/or modifying the polarisation signal of the object. In this paper we
characterise the polarisation effects of the two currently considered designs
for the E-ELT Nasmyth ports as well as the effect of ageing of the mirrors. By
means of the Mueller matrix formalism, we compute the response matrices of each
mirror arrangement for a range of zenith angles and wavelengths. We then
present two techniques to correct for these effects that require the addition
of a modulating device at the polarisation-free intermediate focus that acts
either as a switch or as a part of a two-stage modulator. We find that the
values of instrumental polarisation, Stokes transmission reduction and cross-
talk vary significantly with wavelength, and with pointing, for the lateral
Nasmyth case, often exceeding the accuracy requirements for proposed
polarimetric instruments. Realistic ageing effects of the mirrors after perfect
calibration of these effects may cause polarimetric errors beyond the
requirements. We show that the modulation approach with a polarimetric element
located in the intermediate focus reduces the instrumental polarisation effects
down to tolerable values, or even removes them altogether. The E-ELT will be
suitable for sensitive and accurate polarimetry, provided frequent calibrations
are carried out, or a dedicated polarimetric element is installed at the
intermediate focus.

of these logics adhere to a Tarskian informal semantics, in which
interpretations represent objective states-of-affairs. In other words, these
logics lack the epistemic component of ASP, in which interpretations represent
the beliefs or knowledge of a rational agent. Consequently, neither CP-logic
nor FO(ID) have the need for two kinds of negations: there is only one
negation, and its meaning is that of objective falsehood. Nevertheless, the
formal semantics of this objective negation is mathematically more similar to
ASP's negation-as-failure than to its classical negation. The reason is that
both CP-logic and FO(ID) have a constructive semantics in which all atoms start
out as false, and may only become true as the result of a rule application.
This paper investigates the possibility of adding the well-known ASP feature of
allowing negation in the head of rules to CP-logic. Because CP-logic only has
one kind of negation, it is of necessity this ''negation-as-failure like''
negation that will be allowed in the head. We investigate the intuitive meaning

incorporates joint prediction into its technique for producing features for a
word. We develop efficient variational methods for learning Factorial Hidden
Markov Models from large texts, and use variational distributions to produce
features for each word that are sensitive to the entire input sequence, not
just to a local context window. Experiments on part-of-speech tagging and
chunking indicate that the features are competitive with or better than
existing state-of-the-art representation learning methods.

(nontwisted) periodic boundary condition for link-variables in the temporal
direction. By considering ${\rm Tr} (\hat{U}_4\hat{\not D}^{N_t-1})$, we
analytically derive a gauge-invariant relation between the Polyakov loop
$\langle L_P \rangle$ and the Dirac eigenvalues $\lambda_n$ in QCD, i.e.,
$\langle L_P \rangle \propto \sum_n \lambda_n^{N_t -1} \langle n|\hat U_4|n
\rangle$, which is a Dirac spectral representation of the Polyakov loop in
terms of Dirac eigenmodes $|n\rangle$. Owing to the factor $\lambda_n^{N_t -1}$
in the Dirac spectral sum, this relation generally indicates fairly small
contribution of low-lying Dirac modes to the Polyakov loop, while the low-lying
Dirac modes are essential for chiral symmetry breaking. Also in lattice QCD
calculations in both confined and deconfined phases, we numerically confirm the
analytical relation, non-zero finiteness of $\langle n|\hat U_4|n \rangle$ for
each Dirac mode, and negligibly small contribution from low-lying Dirac modes
to the Polyakov loop, i.e., the Polyakov loop is almost unchanged even by
removing low-lying Dirac-mode contribution from the QCD vacuum generated by
lattice QCD simulations. We thus conclude that low-lying Dirac modes are not
essential modes for confinement, which indicates no direct one-to-one

factor-mediated looping, a context for which the role of sequence remains
poorly understood. Using a suite of synthetic constructs repressed by the Lac

in vitro, we make precise statistical mechanical predictions as to how DNA
sequence influences loop formation and test these predictions using in vivo
transcription and in vitro single-molecule assays. Surprisingly,
sequence-dependent flexibility does not affect in vivo gene regulation. By
theoretically and experimentally quantifying the relative contributions of
sequence and the DNA-bending protein HU to DNA mechanical properties, we reveal
that bending by HU dominates DNA mechanics and masks intrinsic
sequence-dependent flexibility. Such a quantitative understanding of how

earthquakes or floods, as well as to physical attacks, such as an
Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) attack. Such real-world events happen at specific
geographical locations and disrupt specific parts of the network. Therefore,
the geographical layout of the network determines the impact of such events on
the network's physical topology in terms of capacity, connectivity, and flow.
  Recent works focused on assessing the vulnerability of a deterministic
network to such events. In this work, we focus on assessing the vulnerability
of (geographical) random networks to such disasters. We consider stochastic
graph models in which nodes and links are probabilistically distributed on a
plane, and model the disaster event as a circular cut that destroys any node or
link within or intersecting the circle.
  We develop algorithms for assessing the damage of both targeted and
non-targeted (random) attacks and determining which attack locations have the
expected most disruptive impact on the network. Then, we provide experimental
results for assessing the impact of circular disasters to communications
networks in the USA, where the network's geographical layout was modeled
probabilistically, relying on demographic information only. Our results
demonstrates the applicability of our algorithms to real-world scenarios.
  Our algorithms allows to examine how valuable is public information about the
network's geographical area (e.g., demography, topography, economy) to an
attacker's destruction assessment capabilities in the case the network's
physical topology is hidden or examine the affect of hiding the actual physical
location of the fibers on the attack strategy. Thereby, our schemes can be used
as a tool for policy makers and engineers to design more robust networks and
identifying locations which require additional protection efforts.

misclassify an image by applying a certain imperceptible perturbation, which is
found by maximizing the network's prediction error. In addition, the specific

problem to find the maximal number of nodes that the tester can guarantee to
visit, irrespective of the responses of the SUT. We show that the decision
problem of whether the guarantee is less than a given number is NP-complete.

on previous efforts by resolving HII region complexes into multiple sources and
by removing duplicate entries. There are ~2500 candidate HII regions in the

before our now 10-year old discovery [Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 015505 (2004)] of
configurations of seven mutually touching infinitely long round cylinders (then
coined 7-knots). Because of the current interest in string-like objects and
entanglement which occur in many fields of Physics it is useful to find a
simple way to treat ensembles of straight infinite cylinders. Here we propose a
treatment with a chirality matrix. By comparing 7-knot with variable radii with
the one where all cylinders are of equal radii (here 7*-knot, which for the
first time appeared in [phys. stat. solidi, b 246, 2098 (2009)]), we show that
the reduction of 7-knot with a set of non-equal cylinder radii to 7*-knot of
equal radii is possible only for one topologically unique configuration, all
other 7-knots being of different topology. We found novel configurations for
mutually touching infinitely long round cylinders when their numbers are eight
and ultimately nine (here coined 8-knots and 9-knots). Unlike the case of
7-knot, where one angular parameter (for a given set of fixed radii) may change
by sweeping a scissor angle between two chosen cylinders, in case of 8- and
9-knots their degrees of freedom are completely exhausted by mutual touching so
that their configurations are ""frozen"" for each given set of radii. For 8-knot
the radii of any six cylinders may be changeable (for example, all taken equal)
while two remaining are uniquely determined by the others. We show that 9-knot
makes the ultimate configuration where only three cylinders can have changeable
radii and the remaining six are determined by the three. Possible
generalizations and connection with Physics are mentioned.

The model consists of an $\ell_1$-fidelity term and a TV with overlapping group
sparsity (OGS) regularization term. Moreover, we impose a box constraint to the
proposed model for getting more accurate solutions. An efficient and effective
algorithm is proposed to solve the model under the framework of the alternating

arising in transcription, translation, transport, and binding. However, which
component of a pathway triggers such a transition is generally not known. By
linking single-cell experiments on the lactose-uptake pathway in E. coli to
molecular simulations, we devise a general method to pinpoint the particular
fluctuation driving phenotype switching and apply this method to the transition
between the uninduced and induced states of the lac genes. We find that the
transition to the induced state is not caused only by the single event of
lac-repressor unbinding, but depends crucially on the time period over which
the repressor remains unbound from the lac-operon. We confirm this notion in
strains with a high expression level of the repressor (leading to shorter
periods over which the lac-operon remains unbound), which show a reduced
switching rate. Our techniques apply to multi-stable gene regulatory systems in
general and allow to identify the molecular mechanisms behind stochastic
transitions in gene regulatory circuits.

two extremes. We find that different tasks and relationships between tasks

suggests the choice of activation function should always be cross-validated.

star forming regions is now a well established phenomenon. Amongst the nine
star forming regions, G37.55+0.20 is the only case at present where apart from
the presence of a periodic class II methanol maser, correlated flaring of
another masing species, formaldehyde in this case, has been detected. We
perform numerical calculations to investigate under which conditions the 4.8
GHz transition of ortho-formaldehyde is inverted in order to address the
question of the correlated flaring of the 6.7 GHz methanol and 4.8 GHz
formaldehyde masers in G37.55+0.20. We developed a numerical code to study the
population inversion of o-formaldehyde. Equilibrium solutions for the level
populations are found by integrating the rate equations using Heun's method. It
is found that collisional excitation with H$_2$ as well as radiative excitation
by the free-free radio continuum radiation from a nearby ultra- or
hyper-compact HII region can invert the 4.8 GHz transition. It is also found
that radiative excitation by the dust infrared radiation field does not lead to
an inversion of the 4.8 GHz transition. The 14.5 GHz and 28.9 GHz transitions
are inverted only in the presence of the free-free continuum radiation field of
a very compact HII region. Due to the different pumping mechanisms of the
formaldehyde and methanol masers it is unlikely that the near simultaneous
flaring of the methanol and formaldehyde masers in G37.55+0.20 is due to
changes in the pumping of the masers.

associated with photons to carry information from one point to another in
space. As a result, a complete physical model of these channels must
necessarily take quantum effects into account in order to determine their
ultimate performances. Specifically, Gaussian photonic (or bosonic) quantum
channels have been extensively studied over the past decades given their
importance for practical purposes. In spite of this, a longstanding conjecture
on the optimality of Gaussian encodings has yet prevented finding their
communication capacity. Here, this conjecture is solved by proving that the
vacuum state achieves the minimum output entropy of a generic Gaussian bosonic
channel. This establishes the ultimate achievable bit rate under an energy
constraint, as well as the long awaited proof that the single-letter classical
capacity of these channels is additive. Beyond capacities, it also has broad

experimentally realizable and can be suitably manipulated to generate
nonclassical optical states when applied on single- and two-mode coherent,
thermal, and squeezed input states. At low intensities, these nonclassical
states can interact with a secondary mode via a linear optical device to
generate two-mode discrete entangled states, which can serve as a resource in
quantum information protocols. The advantage of these operations are tested by
applying the generated entangled states as quantum channels in CV quantum
teleportation, under the Braunstein and Kimble protocol. We observe that, under
these operations, while the average fidelity of CV teleportation is enhanced
for the nonclassical channel formed using input squeezed states, it remains at
the classical threshold for input coherent and thermal states. This is due to
the fact that though these operations can introduce discrete entanglement in
all input states, it enhances the Einstein-Podolosky-Rosen (EPR) correlations
only in the nonclassical squeezed state inputs, leading to an advantage in CV
teleportation. This shows that nonclassical optical states generated using the
above operations on classical coherent and thermal state inputs are not
resourceful for CV teleportation. This investigation could prove useful in
efficient implementation of noisy non-Gaussian channels, formed by linear

the planar and large N limits are distinct. The action of the one loop and the
two loop dilatation operator reduces to a set of decoupled oscillators and
factorizes into an action on the Z fields and an action on the Y fields. Direct
computation has shown that the action on the Y fields is the same at one and
two loops. In this article, using the su(2) symmetry algebra as well as
structural features of field theory, we give compelling evidence that the
factor in the dilatation operator that acts on the Ys is given by the one loop

filaments in the star formation process and connect remarkably well with nearly
a decade's worth of numerical simulations and theory that have consistently
shown that the ISM should be highly filamentary on all scales and star
formation is intimately related to self-gravitating filaments. In this review,
we trace how the apparent complexity of cloud structure and star formation is
governed by relatively simple universal processes - from filamentary clumps to
galactic scales. We emphasize two crucial and complementary aspects: (i) the
key observational results obtained with Herschel over the past three years,
along with relevant new results obtained from the ground on the kinematics of
interstellar structures, and (ii) the key existing theoretical models and the
many numerical simulations of interstellar cloud structure and star formation.
We then synthesize a comprehensive physical picture that arises from the

Cancer cells are assumed to be structured as a population by two real variables

initiate the study of matrix identities as hard instances for strong proof
systems. A matrix identity of $d \times d$ matrices over a field $\mathbb{F}$,
is a non-commutative polynomial $f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ over $\mathbb{F}$ such that
$f$ vanishes on every $d \times d$ matrix assignment to its variables.
  We focus on arithmetic proofs, which are proofs of polynomial identities
operating with arithmetic circuits and whose axioms are the polynomial-ring
axioms (these proofs serve as an algebraic analogue of the Extended Frege
propositional proof system; and over $GF(2)$ they constitute formally a
sub-system of Extended Frege [HT12]). We introduce a decreasing in strength
hierarchy of proof systems within arithmetic proofs, in which the $d$th level
is a sound and complete proof system for proving $d \times d$ matrix identities
(over a given field). For each level $d>2$ in the hierarchy, we establish a
proof-size lower bound in terms of the number of variables in the matrix
identity proved: we show the existence of a family of matrix identities $f_n$
with $n$ variables, such that any proof of $f_n=0$ requires $\Omega(n^{2d})$
number of lines. The lower bound argument uses fundamental results from the
theory of algebras with polynomial identities together with a generalization of
the arguments in [Hru11].
  We then set out to study matrix identities as hard instances for (full)
arithmetic proofs. We present two conjectures, one about non-commutative
arithmetic circuit complexity and the other about proof complexity, under which
up to exponential-size lower bounds on arithmetic proofs (in terms of the
arithmetic circuit size of the identities proved) hold. Finally, we discuss the
applicability of our approach to strong propositional proof systems such as
Extended Frege.

guarantees both fixed value of spin and Frenkel condition on spin-tensor.
Taking into account the Frenkel condition, we obtain, inevitably, relativistic
corrections to the algebra of position variables: their classical brackets
became noncommutative, with the ""parameter of non-commutativity"" proportional
to the spin-tensor. This leads to a number of interesting consequences in
quantum theory. We construct the relativistic quantum mechanics in canonical
formalism (in physical-time parametrization) and in covariant formalism (in
arbitrary parametrization). We show how state-vectors and operators of
covariant formulation can be used to compute mean values of physical operators
of position and spin. This proves relativistic covariance of canonical
formalism. Various candidates for position and spin operators of an electron
acquire clear meaning and interpretation in the Lagrangian model of Frenkel
electron. We also establish the relation between Frenkel electron and
positive-energy sector of Dirac equation, this allowed us to turn to the
long-standing problem on spin and position operators of Dirac theory. Contrary
to widely assumed opinion, our results argue in favor of Pryce's (d)-type
operators. This implies that effects of non-commutativity could be presented at
the Compton wave length, in contrast to conventional expectations at the Planck
length. At last, we present the manifestly covariant form of spin and position

circulating in human blood, the molecule also exists in dimeric and hexameric
forms that are used as storage. The Insulin monomer contains two distinct
surfaces, namely the dimer forming surface (DFS) and the hexamer forming
surface (HFS) that are specifically designed to facilitate the formation of the
dimer and the hexamer, respectively. In order to characterize the structural
and dynamical behaviour of interfacial water molecules near these two surfaces
(DFS and HFS), we performed atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of Insulin
with explicit water. Dynamical characterization reveals that the structural
relaxation of the hydrogen bonds formed between the residues of DFS and the
interfacial water molecules is faster than those formed between water and that
of the HFS. Furthermore, the residence times of water molecules in the protein
hydration layer for both the DFS and HFS are found to be significantly higher
than those for some of the other proteins studied so far, such as HP-36 and
lysozyme. The surface topography and the arrangement of amino acid residues
work together to organize the water molecules in the hydration layer in order
to provide them with a preferred orientation. HFS having a large polar solvent
accessible surface area and a convex extensive nonpolar region, drives the
surrounding water molecules to acquire predominantly a clathrate-like
structure. In contrast, near the DFS, the surrounding water molecules acquire
an inverted orientation owing to the flat curvature of hydrophobic surface and
interrupted hydrophilic residual alignment. We have followed escape trajectory
of several such quasi-bound water molecules from both the surfaces and
constructed free energy surfaces of these water molecules.These free energy
surfaces reveal the differences between the two hydration layers.

with singularity. A singularity often indicates that geometry of motion may
change at the singular point of configuration space. We face conceptual problem
describing even mechanics of ideal models since the configuration space is not
a smooth manifold, thus, the fully developed means of Hamiltonian Mechanics
cannot be applied. In this report we present a way of conquering the
aforementioned conceptual problem by considering a certain algebra instead of
the configuration space. In this approach configuration space is the real
spectrum of the algebra. The structure of this algebra is completely determined
by the geometry of the singularity. For a broad class of singularities the
desired algebra can be described directly since it is the pullback of two
already known algebras. Availability of the algebra enables to use Differential
Operator Theory. The elementary examples of mechanical systems to which this
algorithm is applicable are flat linkages. In the frames of the presented
approach we build a Poisson structure on a manifold with a one-dimensional
singularity. The same result can be obtained to some other kinds of
singularities. For instance,at the end the we give some specific results for
the case of configuration space consisting of two curves on the plane with
arbitrary order of contact at the intersection point.

$2$-sphere is cast in the framework of the Racah problem for the Hopf algebra
$sl_{-1}(2)$. The related Dunkl-Laplace operator is shown to correspond to a
quadratic expression in the total Casimir operator of the tensor product of
three irreducible $sl_{-1}(2)$-modules. The operators commuting with the Dunkl
Laplacian are seen to coincide with the intermediate Casimir operators and to
realize a central extension of the Bannai-Ito (BI) algebra. Functions on $S^2$
spanning irreducible modules of the BI algebra are constructed and given
explicitly in terms of Jacobi polynomials. The BI polynomials occur as
expansion coefficients between two such bases composed of functions separated
in different coordinate systems.

(HARL), Gulmarg optimized for detecting 2.45 MeV neutron bursts produced during
the atmospheric lightning discharges is also concurrently used for studying
background neutron component present in the atmosphere. These background
neutrons are produced due to the interaction of primary cosmic rays with the
atmospheric constituents. In order to study and extract the information about
the yield of the neutron production during transient atmospheric lightning
discharges, the system is continuously operated to monitor and record the
cosmic ray produced background secondary neutrons in the atmosphere. The data
analysis of the background neutrons recorded by Lead-Free Gulmarg Neutron
Monitor (LFGNM) has convincingly established that the modulation effects due to
solar activity phenomena compare very well with those monitored by the
worldwide IGY or NM64 type neutron monitors which have optimum energy response
relatively towards the higher energy regime of the cosmic rays. The data has
revealed various types of modulation phenomena like diurnal variation, Forbush
decrease etc. during its entire operational period. However, a new kind of a
periodic/seasonal variation pattern is also revealed in the data from September
2007 to September 2012, which is seen to be significantly consistent with the
data recorded by Emilio Segre observatory, Israel (ESOI) Neutron Monitor.
Interestingly, both these neutron monitors have comparable latitude and
altitude. However, the same type of consistency is not observed in the data
recorded by the other conventional neutron monitors operating across the globe.

To appear in Physica D",,"10.1016/j.physd.2013.11.018",,"nlin.PS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is well known that aspects of the formation of localised states in a
one-dimensional Swift--Hohenberg equation can be described by
Ginzburg--Landau-type envelope equations. This paper extends these multiple
scales analyses to cases where an additional nonlinear integral term, in the
form of a convolution, is present. The presence of a kernel function introduces
a new lengthscale into the problem, and this results in additional complexity
in both the derivation of envelope equations and in the bifurcation structure.
  When the kernel is short-range, weakly nonlinear analysis results in envelope
equations of standard type but whose coefficients are modified in complicated
ways by the nonlinear nonlocal term. Nevertheless, these computations can be
formulated quite generally in terms of properties of the Fourier transform of
the kernel function. When the lengthscale associated with the kernel is longer,
our method leads naturally to the derivation of two different, novel, envelope
equations that describe aspects of the dynamics in these new regimes. The first
of these contains additional bifurcations, and unexpected loops in the
bifurcation diagram. The second of these captures the stretched-out nature of
the homoclinic snaking curves that arises due to the nonlocal term.

propose a simple method of unsupervised feature construction based on pairwise

filters to produce new neighborhood features. Next, we connect neighborhood
features that correlate, and construct edge features by subtracting the
correlated neighborhood features of each other. To validate the usefulness of
the constructed features, we ran AdaBoost.MH on four multi-class classification
problems. Our most significant result is a test error of 0.94% on MNIST with an
algorithm which is essentially free of any image-specific priors. On CIFAR-10
our method is suboptimal compared to today's best deep learning techniques,
nevertheless, we show that the proposed method outperforms not only boosting on
the raw pixels, but also boosting on Haar filters.

  Data Locality Potential","Transaction on Architecture and Code Optimization (2014)",,,,"cs.OH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Emerging computer architectures will feature drastically decreased flops/byte
(ratio of peak processing rate to memory bandwidth) as highlighted by recent
studies on Exascale architectural trends. Further, flops are getting cheaper
while the energy cost of data movement is increasingly dominant. The
understanding and characterization of data locality properties of computations
is critical in order to guide efforts to enhance data locality. Reuse distance
analysis of memory address traces is a valuable tool to perform data locality
characterization of programs. A single reuse distance analysis can be used to
estimate the number of cache misses in a fully associative LRU cache of any
size, thereby providing estimates on the minimum bandwidth requirements at
different levels of the memory hierarchy to avoid being bandwidth bound.
However, such an analysis only holds for the particular execution order that
produced the trace. It cannot estimate potential improvement in data locality
through dependence preserving transformations that change the execution
schedule of the operations in the computation. In this article, we develop a
novel dynamic analysis approach to characterize the inherent locality
properties of a computation and thereby assess the potential for data locality
enhancement via dependence preserving transformations. The execution trace of a
code is analyzed to extract a computational directed acyclic graph (CDAG) of
the data dependences. The CDAG is then partitioned into convex subsets, and the
convex partitioning is used to reorder the operations in the execution trace to
enhance data locality. The approach enables us to go beyond reuse distance
analysis of a single specific order of execution of the operations of a
computation in characterization of its data locality properties. It can serve a
valuable role in identifying promising code regions for manual transformation,
as well as assessing the effectiveness of compiler transformations for data
locality enhancement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach using a
number of benchmarks, including case studies where the potential shown by the
analysis is exploited to achieve lower data movement costs and better
performance.

first hop and MISO in second hop. The three models used here give the
flexibility of using STBC (Space Time Block Coding) and combining scheme on any

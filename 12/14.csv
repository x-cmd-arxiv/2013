topological insulators in the presence of a ferromagnetic exchange field. We
demonstrate that for layered materials like Bi$_2$Se$_3$ the surface states on
the top surface behave qualitatively different than the surface states at the
side surfaces. We show that the group velocity of the surface states can be
tuned by the direction and strength of the exchange field. If the exchange
field becomes larger than the bulk gap of the material, a phase transition into
a topologically nontrivial semimetallic state occurs. In particular, the
material becomes a Weyl semimetal, if the exchange field possesses a non-zero
component perpendicular to the layers. Associated with the Weyl semimetallic
state we show that Fermi arcs appear at the surface. Under certain
circumstances either one-dimensional or even two-dimensional surface flat bands
can appear. We show that the appearence of these flat bands is related to
chiral symmetries of the system and can be understood in terms of topological
winding numbers. In contrast to previous systems that have been suggested to
possess surface flat bands, the present system has a much larger energy scale,
allowing the observation of surface flat bands at room temperature. The flat
bands are tunable in the sense that they can be turned on or off by rotation of
the ferromagnetic exchange field. Our findings are supported by both numerical
results on a finite system as well as approximate analytical results.

great detail the very embedded protostellar objects and the structure of the
cloud. PACS data reveal a previously unknown Class 0 object (IC1396A-PACS-1)
located behind the ionization front. IC1396A-PACS-1 is not detectable with
Spitzer, but shows marginal X-ray emission. The data also allowed to study
three of the Class I intermediate-mass objects within the cloud. We derived
approximate cloud temperatures to study the effect and potential interactions
between the protostars and the cloud. The Class 0 object is associated with the
densest and colder part of IC1396A. Heating in the cloud is dominated by the
winds and radiation of the O6.5 star HD 206267 and, to a lesser extent, by the
effects of the Herbig Ae star V 390 Cep. The surroundings of the Class I and
Class II objects embedded in the cloud also appear warmer than the sourceless
areas, although most of the low-mass objects cannot be individually extracted
due to distance and beam dilution. The observations suggest that at least two
episodes of star formation have occurred in IC1396A. One would have originated
the known, ~1 Myr-old Class I and II objects in the cloud, and a new wave of
star formation would have produced the Class 0 source at the tip of the
brigth-rimmed cloud. From its location and properties, IC1396A-PACS-1 is
consistent with triggering via radiative driven implosion (RDI) induced by HD
206267. The mechanisms behind the formation of the more evolved population of
Class I/II/III objects in the cloud are uncertain. Heating of most of the
remaining cloud by Class I/Class II objects and by HD 206267 itself may
preclude further star formation in the region.

we show that while for symmetric channels this ordering turns out to be
equivalent to the stochastic degradation ordering already known to order the
information sets of polar codes, a strictly weaker partial order is obtained
when at least one of the channels is asymmetric. In between, we also discuss
two tools which can be useful for verifying this ordering: a criterion known as
the cut criterion and channel symmetrization. Finally, we discuss potential
applications of the results to polar coding over non-stationary channels.

a statistical approach that allows us to combine the information provided by
helioseimic and solar neutrino data in an effective way. We include in our
analysis the helioseismic determinations of the surface helium abundance and of
the depth of the convective envelope, the measurements of the $^7{\rm Be}$ and
$^8{\rm B}$ neutrino fluxes, the sound speed profile inferred from helioseismic
frequencies. We provide all the ingredients to describe how these quantities
depend on the solar surface composition and to evaluate the (correlated)
uncertainties in solar model predictions. We include errors sources that are
not traditionally considered such as those from inversion of helioseismic data.
We, then, apply the proposed approach to infer the chemical composition of the
Sun. We show that the opacity profile of the Sun is well constrained by the
solar observational properties. In the context of a two parameter analysis in
which elements are grouped as volatiles (i.e. C, N, O and Ne) and refractories
(i.e Mg, Si, S, Fe), the optimal composition is found by increasing the the
abundance of volatiles by $\left( 45\pm 4\right)\%$ and that of refractories by
$\left( 19\pm 3\right)\%$ with respect to the values provided by AGSS09. This
corresponds to the abundances $\varepsilon_{\rm O}=8.85\pm 0.01$ and
$\varepsilon_{\rm Fe}=7.52\pm0.01$. As an additional result of our analysis, we
show that the observational data prefer values for the input parameters of the
standard solar models (radiative opacities, gravitational settling rate, the
astrophysical factors $S_{34}$ and $S_{17}$) that differ at the $\sim 1\sigma$

which is incorporated using a purely repulsive $\delta$-function to model the
strong screening effect due to the presence of the superconductor, are
determined within a Hartree-Fock approximation of the effective Bogoliubov-De
Gennes Hamiltonian that describes the low-energy physics of the wire. Through a
numerical diagonalization procedure we obtain interaction corrections to the
single particle eigenstates and calculate the extended topological phase
diagram in terms of the chemical potential and the Zeeman energy. We find that,
for a fixed Zeeman energy, the interaction shifts the phase boundaries to a
higher chemical potential, whereas for a fixed chemical potential this shift
can occur either to lower or to higher Zeeman energies. This effects can be
interpreted as a renormalization of the g-factor due to the interaction. The
minimum Zeeman energy needed to realize Majorana fermions decreases with
increasing the strength of the Coulomb repulsion. Furthermore, we find that in

which $m$ indivisible items have to be sold to $n$ potential buyers. Each buyer
$i$ is interested in getting exactly $d_i$ items, and each item $j$ gives a
benefit $v_{ij}$ to buyer $i$. We distinguish between unrelated and related

while, in the latter, each item $j$ has a quality $q_j$, each buyer $i$ has a
value $v_i$ and the benefit $v_{ij}$ is defined as the product $v_i q_j$. The
problem asks to determine a price for each item and an allocation of bundles of
items to buyers with the aim of maximizing the total revenue, that is, the sum
of the prices of all the sold items. The allocation must be envy-free, that is,
each buyer must be happy with her assigned bundle and cannot improve her
utility. We first prove that, for related valuations, the problem cannot be
approximated to a factor $O(m^{1-\epsilon})$, for any $\epsilon>0$, unless {\sf
P} = {\sf NP} and that such result is asymptotically tight. In fact we provide
a simple $m$-approximation algorithm even for unrelated valuations. We then
focus on an interesting subclass of ""proper"" instances, that do not contain
buyers a priori known not being able to receive any item. For such instances,
we design an interesting $2$-approximation algorithm and show that no
$(2-\epsilon)$-approximation is possible for any $0<\epsilon\leq 1$, unless
{\sf P} $=$ {\sf NP}. We observe that it is possible to efficiently check if an
instance is proper, and if discarding useless buyers is allowed, an instance
can be made proper in polynomial time, without worsening the value of its

to reproduce important stylized facts of financial time series as the
persistence of volatility. In particular, we analyzed high frequency data from
the Italian stock market from the first of January 2007 until end of December

Particularly we use an indexed semi-Markov model that has been shown to be able

used to forecast, one step ahead, wind speed. In order to check the validity of
the model we show, as indicator of goodness, the root mean square error and

to a rigorous analytical treatment. We show that the lower cut off $b_{\min}$
is a function of symmetry and shape of the shielding cloud, it is not
universal. In the subthermal case shielding is spherical and $b_{\min}$ is to
be identified with the de Broglie wavelength; at superthermal drift the
shielding cloud exhibits cylindrical (axial) symmetry and $b_{\min}$ is the
classical parameter of perpendicular deflection. In both situations the cut
offs are determined by the electron-ion encounters at large collision
parameters. This is in net contrast to the governing standard meaning that
attributes $b_{\min}$ to the Coulomb singularity at vanishing collision
parameters $b$ and, consequently, assigns it universal validity. The origin of
the contradictions in the traditional picture is analyzed.

the immersion in digital games. Among the several AI approaches, player
modeling is becoming an important one. The main idea is to understand and model
the player characteristics and behaviors in order to develop a better AI. In
this work, we discuss several aspects of this new field. We proposed a taxonomy
to organize the area, discussing several facets of this topic, ranging from
implementation decisions up to what a model attempts to describe. We then
classify, in our taxonomy, some of the most important works in this field. We
also presented a generic approach to deal with player modeling using ML, and we
instantiated this approach to model players' preferences in the game
Civilization IV. The instantiation of this approach has several steps. We first
discuss a generic representation, regardless of what is being modeled, and
evaluate it performing experiments with the strategy game Civilization IV.
Continuing the instantiation of the proposed approach we evaluated the
applicability of using game score information to distinguish different
preferences. We presented a characterization of virtual agents in the game,
comparing their behavior with their stated preferences. Once we have
characterized these agents, we were able to observe that different preferences
generate different behaviors, measured by several game indicators. We then
tackled the preference modeling problem as a binary classification task, with a
supervised learning approach. We compared four different methods, based on
different paradigms (SVM, AdaBoost, NaiveBayes and JRip), evaluating them on a
set of matches played by different virtual agents. We conclude our work using
the learned models to infer human players' preferences. Using some of the
evaluated classifiers we obtained accuracies over 60% for most of the inferred
preferences.

particular, we allow data publishers to extend differential privacy using a
policy, which specifies (a) secrets, or information that must be kept secret,
and (b) constraints that may be known about the data. While the secret
specification allows increased utility by lessening protection for certain
individual properties, the constraint specification provides added protection
against an adversary who knows correlations in the data (arising from
constraints). We formalize policies and present novel algorithms that can
handle general specifications of sensitive information and certain count

significantly lesser noise than their differentially private counterparts. We

at about 3 kpc from the Sun and $\sim$7 kpc from the Galactic centre. Its
position makes this cluster particularly interesting in the framework of the
chemical properties of the Galactic disc because very few old OCs reside in the
inner part of the disc. For this reason it has been selected as a cluster
target of the Gaia-ESO Survey, and spectra of many stars in the main sequence
and red clump phases are now available. Moreover, although it has been studied
by several authors in the past, no consensus on the evolutionary status of Tr
20 has been reached. The heavy contamination of field stars (the line of sight
of Tr 20 crosses the Carina spiral arm) complicates a correct interpretation.
Another interesting aspect of the cluster is that it shows a broadened
main-sequence turn-off and a prominent and extended red-clump, characteristics
that are not easily explained by classical evolutionary models. Exploiting both
spectroscopic information from the Gaia-ESO Survey (and the ESO archive) and
literature photometry, we obtain a detailed and accurate analysis of the
properties of the cluster. We make use of the first accurate metallicity
measurement ever obtained from several spectra of red clump stars, and of
cluster membership determination using radial velocities. According to the
evolutionary models adopted, we find that Tr 20 has an age in the range
1.35-1.66 Gyr, an average reddening $E(B-V)$ in the range 0.31-0.35 mag, and a
distance modulus $(m-M)_0$ between 12.64 and 12.72 mag. The spectroscopic
metallicity is [Fe/H]=+0.17 dex. We discuss the structural properties of the
object and constrain possible hypotheses for its broadened upper main sequence
by estimating the effect of differential reddening and its extended red clump.

SNRs are clearly detected in the X-ray possibly except for G348.5$-$0.0. Our
study reveals that the four detected SNRs all feature center-filled X-ray
morphologies and that the observed emission from these sources is thermal in
all cases. We argue that these SNRs should be classified as mixed-morphology
SNRs (MM SNRs): our study strengthens the correlation between MM SNRs and SNRs
interacting with molecular clouds and suggests that the origin of
mixed-morphology SNRs may be due to the interactions between these SNRs and
adjacent clouds. Our ASCA analysis of G311.5$-$0.3 reveals for the first time
X-ray emission from this SNR: the X-ray emission is center-filled within the
radio and infrared shells and thermal in nature ($kT$ $\sim$ 0.98 keV), thus
motivating its classification as an MM SNR. We find considerable spectral
variations in the properties associated with the plasmas of the other
X-ray-detected SNRs, such as a possible overabundance of magnesium in the
plasma of Kes 17. Finally, we also estimate such properties as electron density
$n$$_e$, radiative age $t$$_{rad}$ and swept-up mass $M$$_X$ for each of the

in the host galaxy does not give a good fit, leaving residuals showing concave
curvature in 8400-8900 A with an amplitude of about 0.6% of the flux. Such a
curvature in the short wavelength range cannot be explained either by
extinction at the host with standard extinction curves, intrinsic curvature of
afterglow spectra, or by the known systematic uncertainties in the observed
spectrum. The red damping wing by intervening HI gas outside the host can
reduce the residual by about 3 sigma statistical significance. We find that a
damped Ly alpha system is not favored as the origin of this intervening HI
absorption, from the observed Ly beta and metal absorption features. Therefore
absorption by diffuse IGM remains as a plausible explanation. A fit by a simple
uniform IGM model requires HI neutral fraction of f_HI ~ 0.1-0.5 depending on
the distance to the GRB host, implying high f_HI IGM associated with the
observed dark Gunn-Peterson (GP) troughs. This gives a new evidence that the
reionization is not yet complete at z ~ 6.

Saving the state of the InfiniBand network as part of distributed checkpointing
has been a long-standing challenge for researchers. Because of a lack of a
solution, typical MPI implementations have included custom checkpoint-restart
services that ""tear down"" the network, checkpoint each node as if the node were
a standalone computer, and then re-connect the network again. We present the
first example of transparent, system-initiated checkpoint-restart that directly
supports InfiniBand. The new approach is independent of any particular Linux
kernel, thus simplifying the current practice of using a kernel-based module,
such as BLCR. This direct approach results in checkpoints that are found to be
faster than with the use of a checkpoint-restart service. The generality of
this approach is shown not only by checkpointing an MPI computation, but also a
native UPC computation (Berkeley Unified Parallel C), which does not use MPI.
Scalability is shown by checkpointing 2,048 MPI processes across 128 nodes
(with 16 cores per node). In addition, a cost-effective debugging approach is
also enabled, in which a checkpoint image from an InfiniBand-based production
cluster is copied to a local Ethernet-based cluster, where it can be restarted
and an interactive debugger can be attached to it. This work is based on a
plugin that extends the DMTCP (Distributed MultiThreaded CheckPointing)
checkpoint-restart package.

based on the large planet diversity observed so far. To date, only few tens of
planets have been discovered orbiting stars ascending the Red Giant Branch.
Although several theories have been proposed, the question of how planets die
remains open due to the small number statistics. In this work we study the
giant star Kepler-91 (KOI-2133) in order to determine the nature of a
transiting companion. This system was detected by the Kepler Space Telescope.
However, its planetary confirmation is needed. We confirm the planetary nature
of the object transiting the star Kepler-91 by deriving a mass of $
M_p=0.88^{+0.17}_{-0.33} ~M_{\rm Jup}$ and a planetary radius of
$R_p=1.384^{+0.011}_{-0.054} ~R_{\rm Jup}$. Asteroseismic analysis produces a
stellar radius of $R_{\star}=6.30\pm 0.16 ~R_{\odot}$ and a mass of
$M_{\star}=1.31\pm 0.10 ~ M_{\odot} $. We find that its eccentric orbit
($e=0.066^{+0.013}_{-0.017}$) is just $1.32^{+0.07}_{-0.22} ~ R_{\star}$ away
from the stellar atmosphere at the pericenter. Kepler-91b could be the previous
stage of the planet engulfment, recently detected for BD+48 740. Our
estimations show that Kepler-91b will be swallowed by its host star in less
than 55 Myr. Among the confirmed planets around giant stars, this is the
planetary-mass body closest to its host star. At pericenter passage, the star
subtends an angle of $48^{\circ}$, covering around 10% of the sky as seen from
the planet. The planetary atmosphere seems to be inflated probably due to the
high stellar irradiation.

of strong absorbers near the close galaxy pair suggests that the cool gas

~8 days. The rotation period distribution has a morphology similar to the
coeval Pleiades cluster, suggesting the universal nature of stellar rotation
distributions. Employing two different gyrochronology methods, we find an age
of 146+13-14 Myr for the cluster. Using the same techniques, we infer an age of
134+9-10 Myr for the Pleiades measured from existing literature rotation
periods. These rotation-derived ages agree with independently determined
cluster ages based on the lithium depletion boundary technique. Additionally,
we evaluate different gyrochronology models, and quantify levels of agreement
between the models and the Blanco 1/Pleiades rotation period distributions,
including incorporating the rotation distributions of clusters at ages up to

rotation evolution of stars hotter than the Sun; however, we find cooler stars
rotating faster than predicted by a Skumanich-law, suggesting a mass dependence
in the efficiency of stellar angular momentum loss rate. Finally, we compare
the Blanco 1 and Pleiades rotation period distributions to available non-linear
angular momentum evolution models. We find they require a significant mass

stochastic, multi-scale magnetic field models that are consistent with
observations of Faraday rotation measures from Coma. By comparing to ROSAT

between speed and accuracy. It is based on linear compression of the collection
of kernels into a small number of coefficients in an optimal eigenbasis. The
final result can then be decompressed in constant time for each desired

band X-ray luminosity is primarily increasing with stellar mass, and at similar
mass and spectral type is higher at larger redshifts. When comparing at the
same stellar mass, we find that the X-ray luminosity is slightly higher for
younger galaxies (i.e., weaker 4000\AA breaks), but the scatter in this
relation is large. We compare the observed X-ray luminosities to those expected
from low and high mass X-ray binaries (XRBs). For blue galaxies, XRBs can
almost fully account for the observed emission, while for older galaxies with
larger 4000\AA breaks, active galactic nuclei (AGN) or hot gas dominate the
measured X-ray flux. After correcting for XRBs, the X-ray luminosity is still
slightly higher in younger galaxies, although this correlation is not

exoplanet-exomoon system, MOA-2011-BLG-262, with a primary lens mass of M_host
~ 4 Jupiter masses hosting a sub-Earth mass moon. The data are well fit by this
exomoon model, but an alternate star+planet model fits the data almost as well.
Nevertheless, these results indicate the potential of microlensing to detect
exomoons, albeit ones that are different from the giant planet moons in our
solar system. The argument for an exomoon hinges on the system being relatively
close to the Sun. The data constrain the product M pi_rel, where M is the lens
system mass and pi_rel is the lens-source relative parallax. If the lens system
is nearby (large pi_rel), then M is small (a few Jupiter masses) and the
companion is a sub-Earth-mass exomoon. The best-fit solution has a large
lens-source relative proper motion, mu_rel = 19.6 +- 1.6 mas/yr, which would
rule out a distant lens system unless the source star has an unusually high
proper motion. However, data from the OGLE collaboration nearly rule out a high
source proper motion, so the exoplanet+exomoon model is the favored
interpretation for the best fit model. However, the alternate solution has a
lower proper motion, which is compatible with a distant (so stellar) host. A
Bayesian analysis does not favor the exoplanet+exomoon interpretation, so
Occam's razor favors a lens system in the bulge with host and companion masses
of M_host = 0.12 (+0.19 -0.06) M_solar and m_comp = 18 (+28 -100 M_earth, at a
projected separation of a_perp ~ 0.84 AU. The existence of this degeneracy is
an unlucky accident, so current microlensing experiments are in principle
sensitive to exomoons. In some circumstances, it will be possible to
definitively establish the low mass of such lens systems through the
microlensing parallax effect. Future experiments will be sensitive to less
extreme exomoons.

about 10% of the needed fuel to sustain star formation in these galaxies. Most
of these observations have been conducted using interferometers and may have
missed lower column density, diffuse, HI gas that may trace the missing 90% of
gas. Such gas may represent the so-called ""cold flows"" predicted by current
theories of galaxy formation to have never been heated above the virial
temperature of the dark matter halo. As a first attempt to identify such cold
flows around nearby galaxies and complete the census of HI down to N(HI)~10^18
cm^-2, I used the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to map the
circumgalactic (r < 100-200 kpc) HI environment around NGC 2997 and NGC 6946.
The resulting GBT observations cover a four square degree area around each
galaxy with a 5-sigma detection limit of N(HI)~10^18 cm^-2 over a 20 km/s
linewidth. This project complements absorption line studies, which are
well-suited to the regime of lower N(HI). Around NGC 2997, the GBT HI data
reveal an extended HI disk and all of its surrounding gas-rich satellite
galaxies, but no filamentary features. Furthermore, the HI mass as measured
with the GBT is only 7% higher than past interferometric measurements. After
correcting for resolution differences, the HI extent of the galaxy is 23%
larger at the N(HI)~1.2x10^18 cm^-2 level as measured by the GBT. On the other
hand, the HI observations of NGC 6946 reveal a filamentary feature apparently
connecting NGC 6946 with its nearest companions. This HI filament has
N(HI)~10^18 cm^-2 and a FWHM of 55+-5 km/s and was invisible in past
interferometer observations. The properties of this filament are broadly
consistent with being a cold flow or debris from a past tidal interaction
between NGC 6946 and its satellites.

successful in producing planets with masses and orbits similar to those of
Venus and Earth. However, these models have generally failed to produce
Mars-sized objects around 1.5 AU. The body that is usually formed around Mars'
semimajor axis is, in general, much more massive than Mars. Only when Jupiter
and Saturn are assumed to have initially very eccentric orbits (e $\sim$ 0.1),
which seems fairly unlikely for the solar system, or alternately, if the
protoplanetary disk is truncated at 1.0 AU, simulations have been able to
produce Mars-like bodies in the correct location. In this paper, we examine an
alternative scenario for the formation of Mars in which a local depletion in
the density of the protosolar nebula results in a non-uniform formation of
planetary embryos and ultimately the formation of Mars-sized planets around 1.5
AU. We have carried out extensive numerical simulations of the formation of
terrestrial planets in such a disk for different scales of the local density
depletion, and for different orbital configurations of the giant planets. Our
simulations point to the possibility of the formation of Mars-sized bodies
around 1.5 AU, specifically when the scale of the disk local mass-depletion is
moderately high (50-75%) and Jupiter and Saturn are initially in their current
orbits. In these systems, Mars-analogs are formed from the protoplanetary
materials that originate in the regions of disk interior or exterior to the
local mass-depletion. Results also indicate that Earth-sized planets can form
around 1 AU with a substantial amount of water accreted via primitive
water-rich planetesimals and planetary embryos. We present the results of our
study and discuss their implications for the formation of terrestrial planets

a decelerating one? Can this transition be realized by some viable theoretical

of phenomenological models of a transient acceleration, based on a dynamical
dark energy with a very general form of equation of state
$p_{de}=\alpha\rho_{de}-\beta\rho_{de}^m$. It mimics the cosmological constant
$\rho_{de}\rightarrow$ const for small scale factor $a$, and behaves as a
barotropic gas with $\rho_{de}\rightarrow a^{-3(\alpha+1)}$ with $\alpha\ge 0$
for large $a$. The cosmic evolution of four models in the class has been
examined in details, and all yields a smooth transient acceleration. Depending
on the specific model, the future universe may be dominated either by the dark
energy or by the matter. In two models, the dynamical dark energy can be
explicitly realized by a scalar field with an analytical potential $V(\phi)$.
Moreover, the statistical analysis shows that the models can be as robust as
$\Lambda$CDM in confronting the observational data of SN Ia, CMB, and BAO. As
improvements over the previous studies, our models overcome the over-abundance
problem of dark energy during early eras, and satisfy the constraints on the
dark energy from WMAP observations of CMB.

inconsistencies between the background field method in lattice QCD and

problem necessitates inclusion of operators related by equations of motion. In
the presence of time-dependent electromagnetic fields, for example, such
operators modify Green's functions, thereby complicating the isolation of
hadronic parameters which enter on-shell scattering amplitudes. The
particularly simple case of a scalar hadron coupled to uniform electromagnetic
fields is investigated in detail. At the level of the relativistic effective
theory, operators related by equations of motion are demonstrated to be
innocuous. The same result does not hold in the non-relativistic effective
theory, and inconsistencies in matching are resolved by carefully treating
operators related by equations of motion. As uniform external fields
potentially allow for surface terms, the problem is additionally analyzed on a
torus where such terms are absent. Finite-size corrections are derived for
charged scalar correlation functions in uniform electric fields as a useful
byproduct.

popular approach for handling outliers and mislabeled instances is to remove
any instance that is misclassified by a learning algorithm. However, an
examination of which learning algorithms to use for filtering as well as their
effects on multiple learning algorithms over a large set of data sets has not
been done. Previous work has generally been limited due to the large
computational requirements to run such an experiment, and, thus, the
examination has generally been limited to learning algorithms that are
computationally inexpensive and using a small number of data sets. In this
paper, we examine 9 learning algorithms as filtering algorithms as well as
examining the effects of filtering in the 9 chosen learning algorithms on a set
of 54 data sets. In addition to using each learning algorithm individually as a
filter, we also use the set of learning algorithms as an ensemble filter and
use an adaptive algorithm that selects a subset of the learning algorithms for
filtering for a specific task and learning algorithm. We find that for most
cases, using an ensemble of learning algorithms for filtering produces the
greatest increase in classification accuracy. We also compare filtering with a
majority voting ensemble. The voting ensemble significantly outperforms
filtering unless there are high amounts of noise present in the data set.
Additionally, we find that a majority voting ensemble is robust to noise as
filtering with a voting ensemble does not increase the classification accuracy
of the voting ensemble.

  CitiBike NYC data",,,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bike sharing systems are a very popular means to provide bikes to citizens in
a simple and cheap way. The idea is to install bike stations at various points
in the city, from which a registered user can easily loan a bike by removing it
from a specialized rack. After the ride, the user may return the bike at any
station (if there is a free rack). Services of this kind are mainly public or
semi-public, often aimed at increasing the attractiveness of non-motorized
means of transportation, and are usually free, or almost free, of charge for
the users. Depending on their location, bike stations have specific patterns
regarding when they are empty or full. For instance, in cities where most jobs
are located near the city centre, the commuters cause certain peaks in the
morning: the central bike stations are filled, while the stations in the
outskirts are emptied. Furthermore, stations located on top of a hill are more
likely to be empty, since users are less keen on cycling uphill to return the
bike, and often leave their bike at a more reachable station. These issues
result in substantial user dissatisfaction which may eventually cause the users
to abandon the service. This is why nowadays most bike sharing system providers
take measures to rebalance them. Over the last few years, balancing bike
sharing systems (BBSS) has become increasingly studied in optimization. As
such, generating meaningful instance to serve as a benchmark for the proposed
approaches is an important task. In this technical report we describe the
procedure we used to generate BBSS problem instances from data of the CitiBike
NYC bike sharing system.

exploiting the slowness (phase and group) and time location estimates based on

present a Cramer Rao Bound (CRB) analysis for slowness estimation in the (f-k)

estimates have more variance than the phase slowness estimates and time
location estimates. In order to improve the group slowness estimates we exploit
the time compactness property of the modes to effectively represent the data as
a linear superposition of time compact space time propagators parameterized by
the phase and group slowness. A linear least squares estimation algorithm in
the space time domain is then used to obtain improved group slowness estimates.
The performance of the method is demonstrated on real borehole acoustic data

primary transit and secondary eclipse measurements, indicate the presence of
the most abundant carbon and oxygen molecular species (H2O, CH4, CO, and CO2)
in a few exoplanets. However, efforts to constrain the molecular abundances to
within several orders of magnitude are thwarted by the broad range of
degenerate solutions that fit the data. Here we explore, with radiative
transfer models and analytical approximations, the nature of the degenerate
solution sets resulting from the sparse measurements of ""hot Jupiter""
exoplanets. As demonstrated with simple analytical expressions, primary transit
measurements probe roughly 4 atmospheric scale heights at each wavelength band.
Derived mixing ratios from these data are highly sensitive to errors in the
radius in planet (at a reference pressure), which are approximately a few
percent. For example, an uncertainty of 1% in the radius of a 1000 K and
H2-based exoplanet with Jupiter's radius and mass, causes an uncertainty of a
factor of ~100-10000 in the derived gas mixing ratios. The degree of
sensitivity depends on how the line strength increases with the optical depth
(i.e. the curve of growth) and the atmospheric scale height. Temperature
degeneracies in the solutions of the primary transit data, which manifest their
effects through scale height and absorption coefficients, are smaller. We argue
that these challenges can be partially surmounted by a combination of selected
wavelength sampling of optical and IR measurements and, when possible, the
joint analysis of transit and secondary eclipse data of exoplanets.

500 processor cores and several hundred terabytes of persistent storage are

Virtual Observatory Alliance's VOSpace protocol, and is accessible both
interactively, and to all processing jobs. The user interacts with CANFAR by
utilizing virtual machines, which appear to them as equivalent to a desktop.
Each machine is replicated as desired to perform large-scale parallel
processing. Such an arrangement enables the user to immediately install and run
the same astronomy code that they already utilize, in the same way as on a
desktop. In addition, unlike many cloud systems, batch job scheduling is
handled for the user on multiple virtual machines by the Condor job queueing
system. Skytree is installed and run just as any other software on the system,
and thus acts as a library of command line data mining functions that can be
integrated into one's wider analysis. Thus we have created a generic
environment for large-scale analysis by data mining, in the same way that
CANFAR itself has done for storage and processing. Because Skytree scales to
large data in linear runtime, this allows the full sophistication of the huge
fields of data mining and machine learning to be applied to the hundreds of
millions of objects that make up current large datasets. We demonstrate the

to the receiver but cannot be easily compensated is studied. Examples of such
situations include point-to-point communication over inter-symbol interference
(ISI) channels and asynchronous wireless networks. In these scenarios, although
the receiver may know all the delays, it is often not be an easy task for the
receiver to compensate the delays as the signals are mixed together. A novel
framework called interleave/deinterleave transform (IDT) is proposed to deal
with this problem. It is shown that the IDT allows one to design the delays so
that quasi-cyclic (QC) codes with a proper shifting constraint can be used
accordingly. When used in conjunction with QC codes, IDT provides significantly
better performance than existing schemes relying solely on cyclic codes. Two
instances of asynchronous physical-layer network coding, namely the
integer-forcing equalization for ISI channels and asynchronous
compute-and-forward, are then studied. For integer-forcing equalization, the
proposed scheme provides improved performance over using cyclic codes. For
asynchronous compute-and-forward, the proposed scheme shows that there is no
loss in the achievable information due to delays which are integer multiples of
the symbol duration. Further, the proposed approach shows that delays
introduced by the channel can sometimes be exploited to obtain higher
information rates than those obtainable in the synchronous case. The proposed
IDT can be thought of as a generalization of the interleaving/deinterleaving
idea proposed by Wang et al. which allows the use of QC codes thereby
substantially increasing the design space.

flip is a direct consequence of chiral $U(3)$ symmetry breaking and electroweak
symmetry breaking. The identical feature is also shared by the mass generation
of SM fermions. In this review, we use MSSM as an example to illustrate an
explicit connection between bottom Yukawa coupling and rare decay process of
$b\to s\gamma$. We take a symmetry approach to study the common symmetry
breaking in supersymmetric correction to bottom quark mass generation and $b\to
s\gamma$. We show that Large Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking effect and
$R$-symmetry breaking effect required by $b\to s\gamma$ inevitably lead to
significant reduction of bottom Yukawa ${y}_{b}$. To compromise the reduction
in $b\bar{b}$, a new decay is also needed to keep the Higgs total width as the
SM value.

database systems that can store and support queries over encrypted data. A
common architecture for such systems is to use a trusted component such as a
cryptographic co-processor for query processing that is used to securely
decrypt data and perform computations in plaintext. The trusted component has
limited memory, so most of the (input and intermediate) data is kept encrypted
in an untrusted storage and moved to the trusted component on ``demand.''
  In this setting, even with strong encryption, the data access pattern from
untrusted storage has the potential to reveal sensitive information; indeed,
all existing systems that use a trusted component for query processing over
encrypted data have this vulnerability. In this paper, we undertake the first
formal study of secure query processing, where an adversary having full
knowledge of the query (text) and observing the query execution learns nothing
about the underlying database other than the result size of the query on the
database. We introduce a simpler notion, oblivious query processing, and show
formally that a query admits secure query processing iff it admits oblivious
query processing. We present oblivious query processing algorithms for a rich
class of database queries involving selections, joins, grouping and
aggregation. For queries not handled by our algorithms, we provide some initial
evidence that designing oblivious (and therefore secure) algorithms would be
hard via reductions from two simple, well-studied problems that are generally
believed to be hard. Our study of oblivious query processing also reveals
interesting connections to database join theory.

Riesz potential of a Trkalian field is proportional to the field. Hence, the
spherical mean of the X-ray (also Divergent beam) transform of a Trkalian field

pivotal point is the simplification of an intricate quantity: Hilbert transform
of the derivative of Radon transform for a Trkalian field in the Moses basis.

material rods are inserted in the epoxy. The samples are held in one side and
subjected to compressive load on the other side. All the samples swell at load
sides. Image analysis on the carbon-based rods figures out the internal
response, which seems to be isotropy in lateral direction. The results are
compared to simulation results. The simulation is conducted using Abaqus FEA
software. Similar condition is obtained when a brittle thin material is stuck
to the top of simulation model.

separation between two concerns: (1) the interaction between executing

discharge automatically a finite collection of verification conditions (VCs),

are compared to isochrones. We derive further information on the age based on
Li depletion, rotation, and coronal and chromospheric activity. A set of
canonical members is identified to infer mean properties. Membership criteria
are derived from the mean properties and used to discard non-members. The
candidates selected from the literature belong to 35 stellar systems, 42.9% of
which are multiple. Four multiple systems are confirmed in this work by common
proper motion. An orbital solution is presented for the binary system HH Leo B

members are identified. The distribution of EWLi of canonical Her-Lyr members
is spread widely and is similar to that of the Pleiades and the UMa group.
Gyrochronology gives an age of 257+-46 Myr which is in between the ages of the
Pleiades and the Ursa Major group. The measures of chromospheric and coronal
activity support the young age. Four membership criteria are presented based on
kinematics, EWLi, chromospheric activity, and gyro. age. In total, 11 stars are
identified as certain members including co-moving objects plus additional 23

the magnetospheric plasma between the main rings and Enceladus exhibited a time
dependence that we attributed to a seasonally variable source of oxygen from
the main rings (Elrod et al., 2012). Such a temporal variation was subsequently
seen in the energetic ion composition (Christon et al., 2013). Here we include
the most recent measurements by the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) in our
analysis (Elrod et al., 2012) and modeling (Tseng et al., 2013a) of the
temporal and radial dependence of the thermal plasma in the region between the
main rings and the orbit of Enceladus. Data taken in 2012, well past equinox
for which the northern side of the main rings were illuminated, appear
consistent with a seasonal variation. Although the thermal plasma in this
region comes from two sources, the extended ring atmosphere and the Enceladus
torus that have very different radial and temporal trends, the heavy ion
density is found to exhibit a steep radial dependence that is similar for all
years examined. Using our chemical model, we show that this dependence requires
a radial dependence for Enceladus torus than differs from recent models or,
more likely, enhanced heavy ion quenching with decreasing distance from the
edge of the main rings. We examine the possible physical processes and suggest
that the precipitation of the inward diffusing high energy background radiation
onto the edge of the main rings could play an important role.

  255-275","10.1007/s11854-017-0008-5",,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We show that for a parabolic R^d-action on a compact quotient of PSL(2,R)^d,
the cohomologies in degrees 1 through d-1 trivialize, and we give the
obstructions to solving the degree-d coboundary equation, along with bounds on
Sobolev norms of primitives. In previous papers we have established these
results for certain Anosov systems. The present work extends the methods of
those papers to systems that are not Anosov. The main new idea is in Section 4,
where we define special elements of representation spaces that allow us to
modify the arguments from the previous papers. In Section 7 we discuss how one
may generalize this strategy to R^d-systems coming from a product of Lie
groups, like in the systems we have here.

investigated theoretically. In comparison with time-dependent Hartree-Fock and
exact two electron simulation, we show that the ionization rate is
overestimated in SAE approximation. A modified single-active-electron model is
formulated by taking into account of the dynamical core polarization. Applying
the new approach to Ca atoms, it is found that the polarization of the core can
be considered instantaneous and the large polarizability of the cation
suppresses the ionization by 50% while the photoelectron cut-off energy
increases slightly. The existed tunneling ionization formulation can be
corrected analytically by considering core polarization.

in the KcsA potassium ion channel. This model is fully consistent with the fact
that two conduction pathways are involved in the translocation of ions thorough
the filter, and we show that the presence of a second path may actually bring
advantages for the filter as a result of quantum interference. To highlight
interferences and resonances in the model, we consider the selectivity filter
to be driven by a controlled time-dependent external field which changes the
free energy scenario and consequently the conduction of the ions. In
particular, we demonstrate that the two-pathway conduction mechanism is more
advantageous for the filter when dephasing in the transient configurations is
lower than in the main configurations. As a matter of fact, K$^+$ ions in the
main configurations are highly coordinated by oxygen atoms of the filter
backbone and this increases noise. Moreover, we also show that, for a wide
range of dephasing rates and driving frequencies, the two-pathway conduction
used by the filter leads indeed to higher ionic currents when compared with the
single path model.

cluster, which is relatively close, the brightest in the X-ray sky and a
relaxed object with a cool core. A number of exposures of central regions and
offset pointing with the X-ray Imaging Spectrometer cover a region within radii
of 20'-30'. The central data are used to evaluate the instrumental energy-scale
calibration with accuracy confirmed to within around 300 km/s, by the spatial
and temporal variation of the instruments. These deep and well-calibrated data
are used to measure X-ray redshifts of the intracluster medium. A hint of gas
bulk motion, with radial velocity of about -(150-300) km/s, relative to the
main system was found at 2-4 arcmin (45-90kpc) west of the cluster center,
where an X-ray excess and a cold front were found previously. No other velocity
structure was discovered. Over spatial scales of 50-100kpc and within 200kpc
radii of the center, the gas-radial-velocity variation is below 300 km/s, while
over scales of 400 kpc within 600 kpc radii, the variation is below 600 km/s.
These X-ray redshift distributions are compared spatially with those of optical
member galaxies for the first time in galaxy clusters. Based on X-ray line
widths gas turbulent velocities within these regions are also constrained
within 1000-3000 km/s. These results of gas dynamics in the core and larger
scales in association with cluster merger activities are discussed and future
potential of high-energy resolution spectroscopy with ASTRO-H is considered.

widely used by many locating systems for its characteristics of low cost and
high accuracy. However, because it is hard to support code division multiple
access in narrowband signal, to track multiple targets, existing NBU-based
locating systems generally need to assign exclusive time slot to each target to
avoid the signal conflicts. Because the propagation speed of ultrasound is slow
in air, dividing exclusive time slots on a single channel causes the location
updating rate for each target rather low, leading to unsatisfied tracking
performances as the number of targets increases. In this paper, we investigated
a new multiple target locating method using NBU, called UltraChorus, which is
to locate multiple targets while allowing them sending NBU signals
simultaneously, i.e., in chorus mode. It can dramatically increase the location
updating rate. In particular, we investigated by both experiments and
theoretical analysis on the necessary and sufficient conditions for resolving
the conflicts of multiple NBU signals on a single channel, which is referred as
the conditions for chorus ranging and chorus locating. To tackle the difficulty
caused by the anonymity of the measured distances, we further developed
consistent position generation algorithm and probabilistic particle filter
algorithm}to label the distances by sources, to generate reasonable location
estimations, and to disambiguate the motion trajectories of the multiple
concurrent targets based on the anonymous distance measurements. Extensive
evaluations by both simulation and testbed were carried out, which verified the
effectiveness of our proposed theories and algorithms.

the era of virtual collaborations. Advancement on conceptual and technological

dream, now becoming a reality.
  Problem nature has also been changed over the time. Today, e-Collaborations
are applied to all the domains possible. Extensive data and computing resources
are in need and assistance from human experts is also becoming essential. This
puts a great responsibility on Information Technology (IT) researchers and
developers to provide generic platforms where user can easily communicate and
solve their problems. To realize this concept, distributed computing has
offered many paradigms, e.g. cluster, grid, cloud computing. Virtual
Organization (VO) is a logical orchestration of globally dispersed resources to
achieve common goals.
  Existing paradigms and technology are used to form Virtual Organization, but
lack of standards remained a critical issue for last two decades. Our research
endeavor focuses on developing a design blueprint for Virtual Organization
building process. The proposed standardization process is a two phase activity.
First phase provides requirement analysis and the second phase presents a
Reference Architecture for Virtual Organization (RAVO). This form of
standardization is chosen to accommodate both technological and paradigm shift.
We categorize our efforts in two parts. First part consists of a pattern to
identify the requirements and components of a Virtual Organization. Second part
details a generic framework based on the concept of Everything-as-a-Service.

of discrete transformations, one a Lorentz transformation, the other not. It is
these discrete transformations that allow for an isomorphism between the group

encryption-decryption algorithms. In this work performance of image
encryption-decryption algorithms is quantified and compared using the
computation time i.e. the time consumption of encryption-decryption process and
resemblance of input image to the restored image, quantified by MSE. This work
proposes an improvement in computation-time of image encryptiondecryption
algorithms by utilizing image compression properties of the 2-dimensional
Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT2). Initially, computation complexity of the
algorithms is evaluated and compared with that of existing algorithms. This
analysis claims the proposed algorithms to be nearly 8 times faster than the
existing algorithms. Further, simulations are performed using MATLAB7.7 to
quantify performance of existing algorithms and the proposed algorithms using
MSE and computation time. The results obtained in these simulations prove that
for the proposed algorithms MSE between restored and original images is lesser
than that of existing algorithms thereby maintaining the robustness of the
existing algorithms. These algorithms are found sensitive to a variation of
1x10-1 in the fractional orders used in encryption-decryption process.

an Ising model on an arbitrary planar graph can be represented as the Pfaffian
of a skew-symmetric matrix associated to the graph. This results both embodies
the free fermionic nature of any planar Ising model and eventually gives an
effective way of computing its partition functions in closed form. An extension
of this result to non planar models expresses the partition function as a sum
of Pfaffians which number is related to the genus of the oriented surface on
which the graph can be embedded. In graph theory, McLane's theorem (1937) gives
a characterization of planarity as a property of the cycle space of a graph,
and recently, Diestel et al. (2009) extended this approach to embeddings in
arbitrary surfaces. Here we show that McLane's approach naturally leads to
Kasteleyn's results: McLane characterization of planar graphs is just what is
needed to turn an Ising partition function into a Pfaffian. Using this
approach, we prove that the Ising partition function on an arbitrary non planar
graph can be written as \emph{the real part}of the Pfaffian of a single matrix
with coefficients taken in a multicomplex algebra $\C_{\tilde g}$, where
$\tilde g$ is the non-orientable genus, or crosscap number, of the embedding
surface. Known representations as sums of Pfaffians follow from this result. In
particular, Kasteleyn's result which involves $4^g$ matrices with real
coefficients, $g$ orientable genus, is also recovered through some algebraic
reduction.

nearest neighbor binding approach is adapted for calculations in a real system.
We obtain microscopic parameters, namely: i) the free energy of vacancy
formation and the vacancy-solute binding energy, ii) the involved jump
frequencies, and iii) the tracer correlation factor. The present approximation
describes much better the experimental data of self and solute atoms than
recent calculations using a first binding approach. Also, we confirm that a
vacancy drag mechanism is unlikely to occur in $FeCr$ diluted alloys. Our
results also show that the diffusion processes is mainly mediated by vacancies,
while diffusion by intertitial mechanism is several orders of magnitudes
slower.

  Sensor Networks",,,,,"cs.SY cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider an intrusion detection application for Wireless
Sensor Networks (WSNs). We study the problem of scheduling the sleep times of
the individual sensors to maximize the network lifetime while keeping the
tracking error to a minimum. We formulate this problem as a
partially-observable Markov decision process (POMDP) with continuous
state-action spaces, in a manner similar to (Fuemmeler and Veeravalli [2008]).
However, unlike their formulation, we consider infinite horizon discounted and
average cost objectives as performance criteria. For each criterion, we propose
a convergent on-policy Q-learning algorithm that operates on two timescales,
while employing function approximation to handle the curse of dimensionality
associated with the underlying POMDP. Our proposed algorithm incorporates a
policy gradient update using a one-simulation simultaneous perturbation
stochastic approximation (SPSA) estimate on the faster timescale, while the
Q-value parameter (arising from a linear function approximation for the
Q-values) is updated in an on-policy temporal difference (TD) algorithm-like
fashion on the slower timescale. The feature selection scheme employed in each
of our algorithms manages the energy and tracking components in a manner that
assists the search for the optimal sleep-scheduling policy. For the sake of
comparison, in both discounted and average settings, we also develop a function
approximation analogue of the Q-learning algorithm. This algorithm, unlike the
two-timescale variant, does not possess theoretical convergence guarantees.
Finally, we also adapt our algorithms to include a stochastic iterative
estimation scheme for the intruder's mobility model. Our simulation results on
a 2-dimensional network setting suggest that our algorithms result in better
tracking accuracy at the cost of only a few additional sensors, in comparison
to a recent prior work.

appear one-by-one, and we have to maintain a Steiner tree on the current set of
vertices. The cost of the tree is the total length of edges in the tree, and we
want this cost to be close to the cost of the optimal Steiner tree at all
points in time. If we are allowed to only add edges, a tight bound of
$\Theta(\log n)$ on the competitiveness is known. Recently it was shown that if
we can add one new edge and make one edge swap upon every vertex arrival, we
can maintain a constant-competitive tree online.
  But what if the set of vertices sees both additions and deletions? Again, we
would like to obtain a low-cost Steiner tree with as few edge changes as
possible. The original paper of Imase and Waxman had also considered this
model, and it gave a greedy algorithm that maintained a constant-competitive
tree online, and made at most $O(n^{3/2})$ edge changes for the first $n$
requests. In this paper give the following two results.
  Our first result is an online algorithm that maintains a Steiner tree only
under deletions: we start off with a set of vertices, and at each time one of
the vertices is removed from this set: our Steiner tree no longer has to span
this vertex. We give an algorithm that changes only a constant number of edges
upon each request, and maintains a constant-competitive tree at all times. Our
algorithm uses the primal-dual framework and a global charging argument to
carefully make these constant number of changes.
  We then study the natural greedy algorithm proposed by Imase and Waxman that
maintains a constant-competitive Steiner tree in the fully-dynamic model (where
each request either adds or deletes a vertex). Our second result shows that
this algorithm makes only a constant number of changes per request in an
amortized sense.

  Telescopes, 11-15 March 2013, Venice, Italy",,,,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Matter effects modify the mixing and the effective masses of neutrinos in a
way which depends on the neutrino mass hierarchy. Consequently, for normal and
inverted hierarchies the oscillations and flavor conversion results are
different. Sensitivity to the mass hierarchy appears whenever the matter
effects on the 1-3 mixing and mass splitting become substantial. This happens
in supernovae in wide energy range and in the matter of the Earth. The Earth
density profile is a multi-layer medium where the resonance and parametric
enhancements of oscillations occur. The enhancement is realized in neutrino
(antineutrino) channels for the normal (inverted) mass hierarchy. Multi-megaton
scale under ice (water) atmospheric neutrino detectors with low energy
threshold can establish mass hierarchy with $(3 - 10) \sigma$ confidence level
in few years. The main challenges of these experiments are discussed and
various ways to improve sensitivity are outlined. In particular, inelasticity
measurements will allow to increase significance of the hierarchy
identification by $20 - 50 \%$ .

a wave function has collapsed or not, in the following framework: A quantum
system with a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space is initially in state $\psi$; with
probability $0<p<1$, the state collapses relative to the orthonormal basis
$b_1,...,b_d$. That is, the final state $\psi'$ is random; it is $\psi$ with
probability $1-p$ and $b_k$ (up to a phase) with $p$ times Born's probability
$|\langle b_k|\psi \rangle|^2$. Now an experiment on the system in state
$\psi'$ is desired that provides information about whether or not a collapse
has occurred. Elsewhere, we identify and discuss the optimal experiment in case
that $\psi$ is either known or random with a known probability distribution.
Here we present results about the case that no a priori information about
$\psi$ is available, while we regard $p$ and $b_1,...,b_d$ as known. For
certain values of $p$, we show that the set of $\psi$s for which any experiment
E is more reliable than blind guessing is at most half the unit sphere; thus,
in this regime, any experiment is of questionable use, if any at all.
Remarkably, however, there are other values of $p$ and experiments E such that
the set of $\psi$s for which E is more reliable than blind guessing has measure
greater than half the sphere, though with a conjectured maximum of 64% of the
sphere.

environment. Whether and what aspects of such acquired traits may be
transmittable across generations remains unclear. Using prolonged olfactory
training and subsequent two-forced choice testing in Drosophila melanogaster,
it is observed that certain aspects of learned behavior were transmitted from
parents to offspring. Offspring of parents exposed to distinct odors during
both aversive and appetitive conditioning displayed a heightened sensitivity to
those same odors. The conditioned responses associated with those odors,
however, were not transmitted to the offspring as they displayed a constitutive
preference to the parent-exposed stimuli irrespective of whether they were
associated with aversive or appetitive training. Moreover, the degree to which
the offspring preferred the conditioned stimuli markedly varied from
odor-to-odor. These findings suggest that heightened sensitivities to certain
salient stimuli in the environment, but not their associated conditioned
behaviors, may be transmittable from parents to offspring. Such
trans-generational adaptations may influence animal traits over short

evolving, homogeneous magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence can lead to the
formation of enormous current sheets. These coherent structures are observed at
the peak of the energy dissipation rate and are the carriers of long-range
correlations despite all the non-linear interactions during the formation of
turbulence. Even though the largest scale separation has been achieved at this
point, these structures are coherent with a size that spans our computational
domain dominating the scaling of the energy spectrum, which follows a $E
\propto k^{-2}$ power law. As Reynolds number increases curling of the current
sheets, due to Kelvin-Helmhotlz type instabilities and reconnection, modifies
the scaling of the energy spectrum from $k^{-2}$ towards $k^{-5/3}$. This
transition occurs at the highest Reynolds numbers of direct numerical
simulations with resolutions up to $2048^3$ grid points. Finite Reynolds number
behaviour is observed due to the initial correlations without reaching a finite
asymptote for the energy dissipation rate and with an unexpected scaling
between the Taylor and the integral scale Reynolds numbers, i.e. $Re_\lambda
\propto Re^{2/3}$. Our results, therefore, demonstrate that even
state-of-the-art numerical simulations of the highest resolution can be
influenced by the choice of initial conditions and consequently they are
inadequate to deduce unequivocally the fate of universality in MHD turbulence.

form new tumors at distant anatomical locations. The treatment and prevention
of metastatic cancer remains an extremely challenging problem. This work
introduces a novel biologically motivated objective function to the radiation
optimization community that takes into account metastatic risk instead of the
status of the primary tumor. In this work, we consider the problem of
developing fractionated irradiation schedules that minimize production of
metastatic cancer cells while keeping normal tissue damage below an acceptable
level. A dynamic programming framework is utilized to determine the optimal
fractionation scheme. We evaluated our approach on a breast cancer case using
the heart and the lung as organs-at-risk (OAR). For small tumor $\alpha/\beta$
values, hypo-fractionated schedules were optimal, which is consistent with
standard models. However, for relatively larger $\alpha/\beta$ values, we found
the type of schedule depended on various parameters such as the time when
metastatic risk was evaluated, the $\alpha/\beta$ values of the OARs, and the
normal tissue sparing factors. Interestingly, in contrast to standard models,
hypo-fractionated and semi-hypo-fractionated schedules (large initial doses
with doses tapering off with time) were suggested even with large tumor
$\alpha$/$\beta$ values. Numerical results indicate potential for significant
reduction in metastatic risk.

challenging due to contamination of numerous emission lines. Traditional
fitting algorithms such as the least-square fitting and the Levenberg-Marquardt
algorithm (LMA) are fast but are sensitive to initial values of fitting
parameters. They cannot guarantee to find global optimum solutions when the
object functions have multiple minima. In this work, we attempt to fit a
typical quasar spectrum using the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution
Strategy (CMA-ES). The spectrum is generated by composing a number of real
quasar spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar catalog data
release 3 (DR3) so it has a higher signal-to-noise ratio. The CMA-ES algorithm
is an evolutionary algorithm that is designed to find the global rather than
the local minima. The algorithm we implemented achieves an improved fitting
result than the LMA and unlike the LMA, it is independent of initial parameter
values. We are looking forward to implementing this algorithm to real quasar
spectra in UV/optical band.

approximation revealed fundamental characteristics of the dynamo-generated
magnetic fields and the fluid flow. Because these results were obtained for an
incompressible fluid, their validity for gas planets and stars remains to be
assessed. A common approach is to take some density stratification into account
with the so-called anelastic approximation. The validity of previous results
obtained in the Boussinesq approximation is tested for anelastic models. We
point out and explain specific differences between both types of models, in
particular with respect to the field geometry and the field strength, but we
also compare scaling laws for the velocity amplitude, the magnetic dissipation
time, and the convective heat flux. Our investigation is based on a systematic
parameter study of spherical dynamo models in the anelastic approximation. We
make use of a recently developed numerical solver and provide results for the
test cases of the anelastic dynamo benchmark. The dichotomy of dipolar and
multipolar dynamos identified in Boussinesq simulations is also present in our
sample of anelastic models. Dipolar models require that the typical length
scale of convection is an order of magnitude larger than the Rossby radius.
However, the distinction between both classes of models is somewhat less
explicit than in previous studies. This is mainly due to two reasons: we found
a number of models with a considerable equatorial dipole contribution and an
intermediate overall dipole field strength. Furthermore, a large density
stratification may hamper the generation of dipole dominated magnetic fields.
Previously proposed scaling laws, such as those for the field strength, are
similarly applicable to anelastic models. It is not clear, however, if this

large-scale image filtering. The new algorithm, called Monte Carlo non-local
means (MCNLM), speeds up the classical NLM by computing a small subset of image
patch distances, which are randomly selected according to a designed sampling
pattern. We make two contributions. First, we analyze the performance of the
MCNLM algorithm and show that, for large images or large external image
databases, the random outcomes of MCNLM are tightly concentrated around the
deterministic full NLM result. In particular, our error probability bounds show
that, at any given sampling ratio, the probability for MCNLM to have a large
deviation from the original NLM solution decays exponentially as the size of
the image or database grows. Second, we derive explicit formulas for optimal
sampling patterns that minimize the error probability bound by exploiting
partial knowledge of the pairwise similarity weights. Numerical experiments
show that MCNLM is competitive with other state-of-the-art fast NLM algorithms
for single-image denoising. When applied to denoising images using an external
database containing ten billion patches, MCNLM returns a randomized solution
that is within 0.2 dB of the full NLM solution while reducing the runtime by
three orders of magnitude.

this manuscript we present a few methods aimed at recognizing contact and their
neighboring first layer residues. The methods are based on the simplified
analysis of normal modes via the Gaussian Network Model (GNM). The methods
adjust the number of modes used in analysis on the basis of the comparison of
predicted and expected number of targets (contact and first layer residues).
The number of modes used in weighted sum calculation is increased or decreased
if the number of predictions falls out of range for a given protein sequence
length. The methods are able to recognize more than 50% of targets on average.
At the same time they generate slightly more than 40% of false positives. They
are also fairly successful in recognizing near native decoys of the Vakser
decoy sets. The results depicted here show that kinetically active residues are
important in protein-protein interactions. The GNM analysis depicted also shows
that the two interacting chains usually exhibit opposite behavior. While the
binding surface of one of the partners is rigid and stable, the interfacial
area of the other partner is more flexible.

systems subject to different matching uncertainties for both the cases without
and with a leader of bounded unknown control input. Due to the existence of
nonidentical uncertainties, the multi-agent systems discussed in this paper are
essentially heterogeneous. For the case where the communication graph is
undirected and connected, a distributed continuous static consensus protocol
based on the relative state information is first designed, under which the
consensus error is uniformly ultimately bounded and exponentially converges to
a small adjustable residual set. A fully distributed adaptive consensus
protocol is then designed, which, contrary to the static protocol, relies on
neither the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix nor the upper bounds of the
uncertainties. For the case where there exists a leader whose control input is
unknown and bounded, distributed static and adaptive consensus protocols are
proposed to ensure the boundedness of the consensus error. It is also shown
that the proposed protocols can be redesigned so as to ensure the boundedness
of the consensus error in the presence of bounded external disturbances which
do not satisfy the matching condition. A sufficient condition for the existence
of the proposed protocols is that each agent is stabilizable.

degenerate, we find that the values for the solar, atmospheric, and reactor

neutrinos masses are degenerate, the model predicts a strong inverted hierarchy

sets of the Standard Model-like gauge group $G_1\times G_2$ are introduced,
where $G_i=SU(3)_i\times SU(2)_i\times U(1)_i$, which break diagonally to the
Standard Model gauge group at the energy scale $M \sim 10^7$ GeV. Gauge
couplings in $G_1$ are assumed much larger than that in $G_2$. Gauge mediated
supersymmetry breaking is adopted. The first two generations (third one) are
charged only under $G_1$ ($G_2$). The effective supersymmetry spectrum is
obtained. How to reproduce realistic Yukawa couplings is studied. Fine-tuning
for an 126 GeV Higgs is much reduced by the large $A$ term due to direct
Higgs-messenger interaction. Finally, $G_2$ is found to be a non-trivial
realization of the strong unification scenario in which case we can predict
$\alpha_s(M_Z)$ without real unification

0.98-1.05 ($\phi$-like) GeV/$c^{2}$. The spectrum in the $\omega$-like and
$\phi$-like regions can be well described by the hadronic cocktail simulation.
In the $\rho$-like region, however, the vacuum $\rho$ spectral function cannot
describe the shape of the dielectron excess. In this range, an enhancement of
1.77$\pm$0.11(stat.)$\pm$0.24(sys.)$\pm$0.33(cocktail) is determined with
respect to the hadronic cocktail simulation that excludes the $\rho$ meson. The
excess yield in the $\rho$-like region increases with the number of collision
participants faster than the $\omega$ and $\phi$ yields. Theoretical models
with broadened $\rho$ contributions through interactions with constituents in
the hot QCD medium provide a consistent description of the dilepton mass

particle physics at low energies. Its connection to the underlying string
theory can be implemented through higher dimensional supergravities which bear
special characteristics. Their reduction to four dimensions breaks
supersymmetry whose magnitude depends both on the compactifying manifold and
the mechanism that generates the breaking. In particular compactifications,
notably on a $S_1/Z_2$ orbifold, the breaking of supersymmetry occuring on a
hidden brane, residing at one end of $S_1/Z_2$, is communicated to the visible
brane which lies at the other end, via gravitational interactions propagating
in the bulk. This scenario has been exemplified in the framework of the $N=2$,
$D=5$ supergravity. In this note, motivated by the recent developments in the
field, related to the six-dimensional description of the supergravity theory,
we study the $N=2$, $D=5$ supergravity theory as originating from a $D=6$
supergravity which, in addition to the gravity, includes a number of tensor
multiplets. This reduces to $N=1$, $D=4$ supergravity in a two step manner,
first by Kaluza-Klein reduction followed by a $S_1/Z_2$ orbifold
compactification. The resulting theory has striking similarities with the one
that follows from the single standalone $N=2$, $D=5$ supergravity, with no
reference to the underlying higher dimensional $D=6$ supergravity, and a
structure that makes the supersymmetry breaking mechanisms studied in the past
easily incorporated in higher dimensional schemes.

coupling (SOC) of the Ir4+ ion plays an essential role in determining the
antiferromagnetism of the hexagonal spin-chain system Sr3MIrO6 (M = Ni, Co) by
tuning the crystal-field level sequence and altering the Ir-M inter-orbital
interactions. The SOC splits the e'_{g} doublet of the octahedral Ir4+ ion
(t_{2g}^5) in a trigonal crystal field, and the single t_{2g} hole resides on
the e'_{g} upper branch and gives rise to the antiferromagnetic superexchange.
In absence of the SOC, however, the single t_{2g} hole would occupy the a_{1g}
singlet instead, which would mediate an unreal ferromagnetic exchange due to a
direct a_{1g} hopping along the Ir-M chain. We also find that the Ni2+ and Co2+
ions are both in a high-spin state and moreover the Co2+ ion carries a huge
orbital moment. This work well accounts for the recent experiments and
magnifies again the significance of the SOC in iridates.

two qutrit system. Character methods for the local SU(3)xSU(3) transformation
group are used to establish the count of algebraically independent polynomial
invariants up to degree 5 in the components of the density operator. These are
identified up to quartic degree in the standard basis of Gell-Mann matrices,
with the help of the calculus of f and d coefficients. Next, investigating
local measurement operations, we study a SLOCC qutrit group, which plays the
role of a `relativistic' transformation group analogous to that of the Lorentz
group SL(2,C)_R ~ SO(3,1) for the qubit case. This is the group SL(3,C)_R,
presented as a group of real 9x9 matrices acting linearly on the 9-dimensional
space of projective coordinates for the qutrit density matrix. The counterpart,
for qutrits, of the invariant 4x4 Minkowski metric of the qubit case, proves to
be a certain 9x9x9 totally symmetric three-fold tensor generalizing the
Gell-Mann d coefficient. Using this structure, we provide a count of the
corresponding LSL polynomial invariants using group character methods. Finally,
we give an explicit construction of the lowest degree quantity (the cubic
invariant) and its expansion in terms of SU(3)xSU(3) invariants, and we
indicate how to construct higher degree analogues. These quantities are proven
to yield entanglement monotones. This work generalizes and partly extends the

subsystems relax towards the reduction of the global Gibbs state, not the local

certain non-degeneracy conditions on the spectrum are satisfied. Moreover, we
show that almost all pure states with support on a small energy window are

from a statement on equivalence of ensembles generalizing earlier results by
Lima, and give numerical and analytic finite-size bounds, relating the Ising

singular geometry is explained by linking the macroscopic and microscopic

required to address service requests from multiple customers. Aligning the

nontrivial because of a large number of parameters and operational variations
leading to a huge search space. A challenging problem here is to optimize the
staffing while maintaining the system in steady-state and compliant to
aggregate service level agreement (SLA) constraints. Further, because these
parameters change on a weekly basis, the optimization should not take longer
than a few hours. We formulate this problem as a constrained Markov cost
process parameterized by the (discrete) staffing levels. We propose novel
simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) based SASOC (Staff
Allocation using Stochastic Optimization with Constraints) algorithms for
solving the above problem. The algorithms include both first order as well as
second order methods and incorporate SPSA based gradient estimates in the
primal, with dual ascent for the Lagrange multipliers. Both the algorithms that
we propose are online, incremental and easy to implement. Further, they involve
a certain generalized smooth projection operator, which is essential to project
the continuous-valued worker parameter tuned by SASOC algorithms onto the
discrete set. We validated our algorithms on five real-life service systems and
compared them with a state-of-the-art optimization tool-kit OptQuest. Being 25
times faster than OptQuest, our algorithms are particularly suitable for
adaptive labor staffing. Also, we observe that our algorithms guarantee
convergence and find better solutions than OptQuest in many cases.

potential realization of the Kitaev spin lattice. The basic feature of this
spin model is that for each of the three metal-metal links emerging out of a
metal site, the Kitaev interaction connects only spin components perpendicular
to the plaquette defined by the magnetic ions and two bridging ligands. The
fact that reciprocally orthogonal spin components are coupled along the three
different links leads to strong frustration effects and nontrivial physics.
While the experiments indicate zigzag antiferromagnetic order in Na$_2$IrO$_3$,
the signs and relative strengths of the Kitaev and Heisenberg interactions are
still under debate. Herein we report results of ab initio many-body electronic
structure calculations and establish that the nearest-neighbor exchange is
strongly anisotropic with a dominant ferromagnetic Kitaev part, whereas the
Heisenberg contribution is significantly weaker and antiferromagnetic. The
calculations further reveal a strong sensitivity to tiny structural details
such as the bond angles. In addition to the large spin-orbit interactions, this
strong dependence on distortions of the Ir$_2$O$_2$ plaquettes singles out the
honeycomb 5$d^5$ oxides as a new playground for the realization of
unconventional magnetic ground states and excitations in extended systems.

mitotic agamospermy. The data indicate that for sugar beet meiotic agamospermy
is the more typical since 13 of 15 explored progenies were classified as those
produced by meiotic agamospermy and only 2 as produced by mitotic agamospermy.

up in the age of Internet and mobile technology and prefer bringing
technological application into their life. The Learning Resource Center, an
academic information center, takes the initiative in developing a collaborative
network with the participation of students for delivering information of
natural disasters and climate adaptation to the people who live in the
vulnerable areas of Thua Thien Hue province. The network is aimed at helping
local people mitigating vulnerabilities and adapting to the globally climate
change for a better life.

to the case in which an additional axion-like term is present, and we derive
the set of Maxwell's equations that preserves this symmetry. This new set of
equations allows for a gauge symmetry extending the ordinary symmetry in the
classical electrodynamics. We obtain explicit solutions for the new set of
equations in the absence of external sources, and we discuss the implications
of a new internal symmetry between the axion field and the electromagnetic
gauge potential.

physics because they contain exact symmetries and are often completely
integrable. We demonstrate the power of bosonization in elucidating the
structure of a multi-component fermion theory with chiral and internal
symmetries. Many remarkable features and quantum symmetries in such a system
are most readily uncovered in the bosonized form of the original fermion
theory.

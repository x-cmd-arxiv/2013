finding is confirmed by recent data from high energy particle physics. This
clearly demonstrates that our Universe is a plot initiated by an unknown

conclude that the belief in the existence of our Universe is an illusion, as

charge-neutral molecular excitations -- Frenkel excitons. Usually, in amorphous
organic materials, excitons are viewed as quasiparticles, localized on single
molecules, which diffuse randomly through the structure. However, the picture
of incoherent hopping is not applicable to some classes of molecular aggregates
-- assemblies of molecules that have strong near field interaction between
electronic excitations in the individual subunits. Molecular aggregates can be
found in nature, in photosynthetic complexes of plants and bacteria, and they
can also be produced artificially in various forms including quasi-one
dimensional chains, two-dimensional films, tubes, etc. In these structures
light is absorbed collectively by many molecules and the following dynamics of
molecular excitation possesses coherent properties. This energy transfer
mechanism, mediated by the coherent exciton dynamics, resembles the propagation
of electromagnetic waves through a structured medium on the nanometer scale.
The absorbed energy can be transferred resonantly over distances of hundreds of
nanometers before exciton relaxation occurs. Furthermore, the spatial and
energetic landscape of molecular aggregates can enable the funneling of the
exciton energy to a small number of molecules either within or outside the
aggregate. In this review we establish a bridge between the fields of photonics
and excitonics by describing the present understanding of exciton dynamics in
molecular aggregates.

temperature and body size, a phenomenon known as the temperature size rule
(TSR). Several competing hypotheses have been proposed to explain its
occurrence. According to one set of views, the TSR results from inevitable
biophysical effects of temperature on the rates of growth and differentiation,
whereas other views suggest the TSR is an adaptation that can be achieved by a
diversity of mechanisms in different taxa. Our data reveal that the fruit fly,
Drosophila melanogaster, obeys the TSR using a novel mechanism: reduction of
critical size at higher temperatures. In holometabolous insects, attainment of
critical size initiates the hormonal cascade that terminates growth, and hence,
Drosophila larvae appear to instigate the signal to stop growth at a smaller
size at higher temperatures. This is in contrast to findings from another
holometabolous insect, Manduca sexta, in which the TSR results from the effect
of temperature on the rate and duration of growth. This contrast suggests that
there is no single mechanism that accounts for the TSR. Instead, the TSR
appears to be an adaptation that is achieved at a proximate level through
different mechanisms in different taxa.

methods are needed to improve such applications. In this work, an embedded EEG
encoding system should be able to adjust its computational complexity, hence,
energy consumption according to the channel variations. To analyze the

We analyze the computational complexity for a typical discrete wavelet

the encoder effectively reconfigures the complexity control parameters to match

show that using the proposed framework, we can obtain higher reconstruction

combination of techniques from the recent literature as well as observations of
weak-line T Tauri stars (WTTS) to account for the differences in surface
gravity and chromospheric activity between the TTS and dwarfs, which are
typically used as photospheric templates for CTTS. Our improved veiling and
extinction estimates for our targets allow us to extract flux-calibrated
spectra of the excess in the near-infrared. We find that we are able to produce
an acceptable parametric fit to the near-infrared excesses using a combination
of up to three blackbodies. In half of our sample, two blackbodies at
temperatures of 8000 K and 1600 K suffice. These temperatures and the
corresponding solid angles are consistent with emission from the accretion
shock on the stellar surface and the inner dust sublimation rim of the disk,
respectively. In contrast, the other half requires three blackbodies at 8000,
1800, and 800 K, to describe the excess. We interpret the combined two cooler
blackbodies as the dust sublimation wall with either a contribution from the
disk surface beyond the wall or curvature of the wall itself, neither of which
should have single-temperature blackbody emission. In these fits, we find no
evidence of a contribution from optically thick gas inside the inner dust rim.

systems by which a secondary node forwards primary packets whenever the primary

relaying is parametrized by an interference power constraint level imposed on
the transmit power of the secondary user. For sensing-based spectrum sharing,
the probability of detection is also involved in packet relaying control. This
paper considers the choice of these two parameters so as to maximize the
secondary nodes' throughput under certain constraints. The analysis leads to a

from the generalized adsorption equation as an appropriate excess over bulk

emerging from the generalized adsorption equation is the interface excess
shear. This property is specific to coherent interfaces and represents the
thermodynamic variable conjugate to the shear stress applied parallel to the

  (National Conference on Artificial Intelligence)",,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A fundamental question in Computer Science is understanding when a specific
class of problems go from being computationally easy to hard. Because of its
generality and applications, the problem of Boolean Satisfiability (aka SAT) is
often used as a vehicle for investigating this question. A signal result from
these studies is that the hardness of SAT problems exhibits a dramatic
easy-to-hard phase transition with respect to the problem constrainedness. Past
studies have however focused mostly on SAT instances generated using uniform
random distributions, where all constraints are independently generated, and
the problem variables are all considered of equal importance. These assumptions
are unfortunately not satisfied by most real problems. Our project aims for a
deeper understanding of hardness of SAT problems that arise in practice. We
study two key questions: (i) How does easy-to-hard transition change with more
realistic distributions that capture neighborhood sensitivity and
rich-get-richer aspects of real problems and (ii) Can these changes be
explained in terms of the network properties (such as node centrality and
small-worldness) of the clausal networks of the SAT problems. Our results,
based on extensive empirical studies and network analyses, provide important
structural and computational insights into realistic SAT problems. Our
extensive empirical studies show that SAT instances from realistic
distributions do exhibit phase transition, but the transition occurs sooner (at
lower values of constrainedness) than the instances from uniform random
distribution. We show that this behavior can be explained in terms of their
clausal network properties such as eigenvector centrality and small-worldness
(measured indirectly in terms of the clustering coefficients and average node
distance).

factor of the jet at the central engine, $\Gamma_0$, is a few for existing
observations of $\theta_j$. The jet keeps the Lorentz factor low inside the
star by converging cylindrically via collimation shocks under the cocoon
pressure, and accelerates at jet breakout before the free expansion to a
hollow-cone structure. In this new picture the GRB duration is determined by
the sound crossing time of the cocoon, after which the opening angle widens,
reducing the apparent luminosity. Some bursts violating the maximum opening
angle $\theta_{j,\max}\sim 1/5 \sim 12^{\circ}$ imply the existence of a
baryon-rich sheath or a long-acting jet. We can explain the slopes in both
Amati and Yonetoku spectral relations using an off-centered photosphere model,

eigenvalues are large $|m_{1,2,3}| = 0.08-0.12$ eV with a very mild hierarchy

preference towards higher values of $\tan{\beta}$, the ratio of vacuum
expectation values (vev) of two Higgs doublets in MSSM in order to arrive at
the correct low energy output. Such a model predicting large neutrino mass

on 25 March 2011. SDO/AIA images clearly show the formation and ejection of a
plasma blob from the lower solar atmosphere at ~9 min prior to the onset of the
M1.0 flare. This onset of the M-class flare happened at the site of the blob
formation, while the blob was rising in a parabolic path with an average speed
of ~300 km/s. The blob also showed twisting and de-twisting motion in the lower
corona, and the blob speed varied from ~10-540 km/s. The faster and slower EUV
wavefronts were observed in front of the plasma blob during its impulsive
acceleration phase. The faster EUV wave propagated with a speed of ~785 to 1020
km/s, whereas the slower wavefront speed varied in between ~245 and 465 km/s.
The timing and speed of the faster wave match the shock speed estimated from
the drift rate of the associated type II radio burst. The faster wave
experiences a reflection by the nearby AR NOAA 11177. In addition, secondary
waves were observed (only in the 171 \AA channel), when the primary fast wave
and plasma blob impacted the funnel-shaped coronal loops. The HMI magnetograms
revealed the continuous emergence of new magnetic flux along with shear flows
at the site of the blob formation. It is inferred that the emergence of twisted
magnetic fields in the form of arch-filaments/""anemone-type"" loops is the
likely cause for the plasma blob formation and associated eruption along with
the triggering of M-class flare. Furthermore, the faster EUV wave formed ahead
of the blob shows the signature of fast-mode MHD wave, whereas the slower wave
seems to be generated by the field line compression by the plasma blob. The
secondary wave trains originated from the funnel-shaped loops are probably the
fast magnetoacoustic waves.

and $e$ an edge incident to $v$. Two incidences $(v,e)$ and $(w,f)$ are

coloring game [S.D. Andres, The incidence game chromatic number, Discrete Appl.
Math. 157 (2009), 1980-1987] is a variation of the ordinary coloring game where
the two players, Alice and Bob, alternately color the incidences of a graph,
using a given number of colors, in such a way that adjacent incidences get
distinct colors. If the whole graph is colored then Alice wins the game
otherwise Bob wins the game. The incidence game chromatic number $i_g(G)$ of a
graph $G$ is the minimum number of colors for which Alice has a winning
strategy when playing the incidence coloring game on $G$. Andres proved that
%$\lceil 3/2 \Delta(G)\rceil \le $i_g(G) \le 2\Delta(G) + 4k - 2$ for every
$k$-degenerate graph $G$. %The arboricity $a(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the minimum
number of forests into which its set of edges can be partitioned. %If $G$ is
$k$-degenerate, then $a(G) \le k \le 2a(G) - 1$. We show in this paper that
$i_g(G) \le \lfloor\frac{3\Delta(G) - a(G)}{2}\rfloor + 8a(G) - 2$ for every
graph $G$, where $a(G)$ stands for the arboricity of $G$, thus improving the
bound given by Andres since $a(G) \le k$ for every $k$-degenerate graph $G$.
Since there exists graphs with $i_g(G) \ge \lceil\frac{3\Delta(G)}{2}\rceil$,
the multiplicative constant of our bound is best possible.

variations with redshift in star-forming SDSS galaxies of different masses. We
find that the maximum value of the sSFR, sSFRmax, decreases when the stellar
mass, Ms, of a galaxy increases, and decreases with decreasing of redshift. The
sSFRmax can exceed the time-averaged sSFR by about an order of magnitude for
massive galaxies. The metallicity - redshift relations for subsamples of
galaxies with sSFR = sSFRmax and with sSFR = 0.1sSFRmax coincide for massive
(log(Ms/Mo) > 10.5, with stellar mass Ms in solar units) galaxies and differ
for low-mass galaxies. This suggests that there is no correlation between
oxygen abundance and sSFR in massive galaxies and that the oxygen abundance
correlates with the sSFR in low-mass galaxies. We find evidence in favour of
that the irregular galaxies show, on average, higher sSFR and lower oxygen
abundances than the spiral galaxies of similar masses and that the mass -
metallicity relation for spiral galaxies differs slightly from that for
irregular galaxies. The fact that our sample of low-mass galaxies is the
mixture of spiral and irregular galaxies can be responsible for the dependence
of the metallicity - redshift relation on the sSFR observed for the low-mass
SDSS galaxies. The mass - metallicity and luminosity - metallicity relations
obtained for irregular SDSS galaxies agree with corresponding relations for
nearby irregular galaxies with direct abundance determinations. We find that

  Elementary bifurcation theory is applied to the study of the transition and

quantum speedup and to submit a tentative resolution to it. In particular, I
argue that the physical explanation for quantum speedup is precisely the fact
that the phenomenon of quantum entanglement enables a quantum computer to fully
exploit the representational capacity of Hilbert space. This is impossible for
classical systems, joint states of which must always be representable as
product states.
  Chapter 2 begins with a discussion of the most popular of the candidate
physical explanations for quantum speedup: the many worlds explanation. I argue
that unlike the neo-Everettian interpretation of quantum mechanics it does not
have the conceptual resources required to overcome the `preferred basis
objection'. I further argue that the many worlds explanation, at best, can
serve as a good description of the physical process which takes place in
so-called network-based computation, but that it is incompatible with other
models of computation such as cluster state quantum computing. I next consider,
in Chapter 3, a common component of most other candidate explanations of
quantum speedup: quantum entanglement. I investigate whether entanglement can
be said to be a necessary component of any explanation for quantum speedup, and
I consider two major purported counter-examples to this claim. I argue that
neither of these, in fact, show that entanglement is unnecessary for speedup,
and that, on the contrary, we should conclude that it is. In Chapters 4 and 5 I
then ask whether entanglement can be said to be sufficient as well. In Chapter
4 I argue that despite a result that seems to indicate the contrary,
entanglement, considered as a resource, can be seen as sufficient to enable
quantum speedup. Finally, in Chapter 5 I argue that entanglement is sufficient
to explain quantum speedup as well.

categorification, specifically as it applies to the theory of quantum groups.
In this thesis, we would like to provide a new approach to this problem by
looking at Hall algebras. It is know, due to Ringel, that a Hall algebra is
isomorphic to a certain quantum group. It is our goal to describe a
categorification of Hall algebras as a way of doing so for their related
quantum groups. To do this, we will take the following steps. First, we
describe a new perspective on the structure theory of Hall algebras. This view
solves, in a unique way, the classic problem of the multiplication and
comultiplication not being compatible. Our solution is to switch to a different
underlying category $\Vect^K$ of vector spaces graded by a group $K$ called the
Grothendieck group. We equip this category with a nontrivial braiding which
depends on the $K$-grading. With this braiding and a given antipode, we find
that the Hall algebra does become a Hopf algebra object in $\Vect^K$. Second,
we will describe a categorification process, call `groupoidification', which
replaces vector spaces with groupoids and linear operators with `spans' of
groupoids. We will use this process to construct a braided monoidal bicategory
which categorifies $\Vect^K$ via the groupoidification program. Specifically,
graded vector spaces will be replaced with groupoids `over' a fixed groupoid
related to the Grothendieck group $K$. The braiding structure will come from an
interesting groupoid $\EXT(M,N)$ which will behave like the Euler
characteristic for the Grothendieck group $K$. We will finish with a
description of our plan to, in future work, apply the same concept to the
structure maps of the Hall algebra, which will eventually give us a Hopf
2-algebra object in our braided monoidal bicategory.

motion to abstract equations of motion in which the anti-symmetric product of
the quantal algebra plays a key role. We will express the defining identities
of the quantal algebra in terms of the abstract derivation. In this form the
first defining identity (the Jacobi identity) is analogous in form to the
Bianchi identity in general relativity which is one set of gravitational field
equations for the curvature tensor. The identity for the unit element is
equivalent to the important property that the metric is covariantly constant.
Similarly, the Jacobi identity is analogous in form to the homogeneous Maxwell
equations. The anti-symmetric product of the quantal algebra is reflected in

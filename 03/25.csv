manifolds of the form $X/\Gamma$ where $X$ is a contractible Riemannian
manifold and $\Gamma<\Isom(X)$ is a discrete subgroup, typically with infinite
co-volume. The existence depends on the $L^2$-Betti numbers of $\Gamma$, its
subgroups and of a uniform lattice of $\Isom(X)$. As an application, we show
the existence of a uniform positive lower bound on the Cheeger constant of any
manifold of the form $\H^4/\Gamma$ where $\H^4$ is real hyperbolic 4-space and
$\Gamma<\Isom(\H^4)$ is discrete and isomorphic to a subgroup of the
fundamental group of a complete finite-volume hyperbolic 3-manifold. Via
Patterson-Sullivan theory, this implies the existence of a uniform positive
upper bound on the Hausdorff dimension of the conical limit set of such a
$\Gamma$ when $\Gamma$ is geometrically finite. Another application shows the
existence of a uniform positive lower bound on the zero-th eigenvalue of the
Laplacian of $\H^n/\Gamma$ over all discrete free groups $\Gamma<\Isom(\H^n)$
whenever $n\ge 4$ is even (the bound depends on $n$). This extends results of
Phillips-Sarnak and Doyle who obtained such bounds for $n\ge 3$ when $\Gamma$
is a finitely generated Schottky group.

watermark in a computer aided assertion method such that it becomes
undetectable. Finally it stands as a hindrance over many operations without
harming the embedded host document. Unfortunately, many owners of the digital
materials such as images, text, audio and video are reluctant to the spreading
of their documents on the web or other networked environment, because the ease
of duplicating digital materials facilitates copyright violation. Digital media
distribution occurs through various channels. The cover data may or may not
hold any relation with the watermark information. In the last two decades, a
considerable amount of research has been done on the digital watermarking of
multimedia files such as audio, video, images and text. Different type of
watermarking algorithms has been proposed by the researchers to achieve high
level of security and authenticity. In our proposed method, a modified
reversible watermarking technique is introduced, which employs a blueprint
generation of original image based on odd-even embedding methodology to yield
large data hiding capacity, security as well as high watermarked quality. The

with $\alpha \in (0,2)$, $\alpha\not=1$ and possibly non-symmetric tails. To
give a meaning to the concept of solution, we develop a theory of stochastic
integration with respect to $Z$, by generalizing the method of Gin\'e and
Marcus (1983) to higher dimensions and non-symmetric tails. The idea is to
first solve the equation with ""truncated"" noise $\dot{Z}_{K}$ (obtained by
removing from $Z$ the jumps which exceed a fixed value $K$), yielding a
solution $u_{K}$, and then show that the solutions $u_L,L>K$ coincide on the
event $t \leq \tau_{K}$, for some stopping times $\tau_K \uparrow \infty$ a.s.
A similar idea was used in Peszat and Zabczyk (2007) in the setting of
Hilbert-space valued processes. A major step is to show that the stochastic
integral with respect to $Z_{K}$ satisfies a $p$-th moment inequality, for $p
\in (\alpha,1)$ if $\alpha<1$, and $p \in (\alpha,2)$ if $\alpha>1$. This
inequality plays the same role as the Burkholder-Davis-Gundy inequality in the

that improves the stability and accuracy of Page Rank while eliminating the
need for computing the stationary distribution of random walks. Instead of
relying on teleportation to ensure a well defined Markov chain, we develop a
reverse-time reinforcement learning framework that determines web page
authority based on the solution of a reverse Bellman equation. In particular,
for a given reward function and surfing policy we recover a well defined
authority score from a reverse-time perspective: looking back from a web page,
what is the total incoming discounted reward brought by the surfer from the
page's predecessors? This results in a novel form of reverse-time
dynamic-programming/reinforcement-learning problem that achieves several
advantages over Page Rank based methods: First, stochasticity, ergodicity, and
irreducibility of the underlying Markov chain is no longer required for
well-posedness. Second, the method is less sensitive to graph topology and more
stable in the presence of dangling pages. Third, not only does the reverse
Bellman iteration yield a more efficient power iteration, it allows for faster
updating in the presence of graph changes. Finally, our experiments demonstrate
improvements in ranking quality.

Hubble type classifications of cluster galaxies are found to correlate only
weakly with their concentration indices, whereas this correlation is strong for
non-cluster populations of disk galaxies. We identify a population of
early-type disk galaxies in the cluster population with both enhanced and
centrally-concentrated star formation compared to their field counterparts. The
enhanced cluster galaxies frequently show evidence of disturbance. A small but
non-negligible population of cluster galaxies with truncation of star formation

We consider the case when the field theory is a small deformation of a
conformal field theory (CFT), by the addition of a relevant operator O, and
calculate the primordial spectrum predicted in the corresponding holographic
inflation scenario. Using the Ward-Takahashi identity associated with Weyl
rescalings, we derive a simple relation between correlators of the curvature
perturbation and correlators of the deformation operator O at the boundary.
This is done without specifying the bulk theory of gravitation, so that the
result would also apply to cases where the bulk dynamics is strongly coupled.

bi-spectrum and tri-spectrum of the curvature perturbation.

following practical question: Should the time difference quotients of the
snapshots be used to generate the proper orthogonal decomposition basis
functions? The answer to this question is important, since some published
numerical studies use the time difference quotients, whereas other numerical
studies do not. The criterion used in this paper to answer this question is the
rate of convergence of the error of the reduced order model with respect to the
number of proper orthogonal decomposition basis functions. Two cases are
considered: the no_DQ case, in which the snapshot difference quotients are not
used, and the DQ case, in which the snapshot difference quotients are used. The
error estimates suggest that the convergence rates in the $C^0(L^2)$-norm and
in the $C^0(H^1)$-norm are optimal for the DQ case, but suboptimal for the
no_DQ case. The convergence rates in the $L^2(H^1)$-norm are optimal for both
the DQ case and the no_DQ case. Numerical tests are conducted on the heat
equation and on the Burgers equation. The numerical results support the
conclusions drawn from the theoretical error estimates. Overall, the
theoretical and numerical results strongly suggest that, in order to achieve
optimal pointwise in time rates of convergence with respect to the number of
proper orthogonal decomposition basis functions, one should use the snapshot
difference quotients.

to a large variety of systems in condensed matter physics. For this class of

proposed a very efficient numerical method, called O($N$) Green-Function-Based
Monte Carlo (GFMC) method, where a kernel polynomial expansion technique is
used to avoid the full numerical diagonalization of the fermion Hamiltonian
matrix of size $N$, which usually costs O($N^3$) computational complexity.
Motivated by this background, in this paper we apply the GFMC method to the
double exchange model in three spatial dimensions. We mainly focus on the
implementation of GFMC method using both MPI on a CPU-based cluster and
Nvidia's Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) programming techniques on a
GPU-based (Graphics Processing Unit based) cluster. The time complexity of the
algorithm and the parallel implementation details on the clusters are
discussed. We also show the performance scaling for increasing Hamiltonian
matrix size and increasing number of nodes, respectively. The performance
evaluation indicates that for a $32^3$ Hamiltonian a single GPU shows higher
performance equivalent to more than 30 CPU cores parallelized using MPI.

expansion. Although it is often assumed that such isocurvature perturbations

principle serves as a consistency prediction of this large class of

technical side, we utilize a gravita- tional Ward identity in a novel manner to
demonstrate the gauge invariance of the computation. Furthermore, the detailed
computation is interpreted in terms of a soft-{\zeta} theorem and a
gravitational Ward identity. Finally, we also identify explicitly all the

correlations in the formation of the charge gap and a lack of understanding of
the effects of doping on the low energy electronic structure have hindered
experimental progress in realizing many of the predicted states[4-8] including
possible high-Tc superconductivity[7,9]. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy
we map out the spatially resolved density of states in the n=2 RP member,
Sr3Ir2O7 (Ir327). We show that the Ir327 parent compound, argued to exist only
as a weakly correlated band insulator in fact possesses a substantial ~130meV
charge excitation gap driven by an interplay between structure, SO coupling and
correlations. A critical component in distinguishing the intrinsic electronic
character within the inhomogeneous textured electronic structure is our
identification of the signature of missing apical oxygen defects, which play a
critical role in many of the layered oxides. Our measurements combined with
insights from calculations reveal how apical oxygen vacancies transfer spectral
weight from higher energies to the gap energies thereby revealing a path toward

recombination-radiation spectra in X-ray emission. We assume that the CSM of
1.5 $M_{odot}$ exists at 0.07--3 pc away from the supernova in the interstellar
medium (ISM) of density 0.016 cm$^{-3}$. When the blast wave breaks out of the
CSM into the ISM, its velocity rapidly increases and hence particle
acceleration is enhanced. The maximum energy of protons reaches $sim$ 1300 TeV
just after the break-out with $sim$ 0.5% of the explosion energy. We consider
the non-thermal emission from the blast-shocked ISM shell after the break-out.
Synchrotron radio flux at 1 GHz is tens Jy, comparable to the observed from
mixed-morphology SNRs. Because of low density, the gamma-ray luminosity is
dominated by inverse-Compton scattering, which is higher than the $pi^0$-decay
luminosity by an order of magnitude. The total gamma-ray luminosity including
bremsstrahlung is of the order of $10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$ lower than the typical
value $10^{35}$--$10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$ observed from mixed-morphology SNRs.
However, if, e.g., $sim$10% of accelerated protons interact with some matter of

geometries with hyperscaling violation exponent $\theta$, which is a natural
generalization of fermions in Lifshitz spacetime. We prove that the retarded
Green functions in this background satisfy the ARPES (angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy) sum rules by introducing a dynamical source on a UV
brane for zero density fermionic systems. The big difference from the Lifshitz
case is that the mass of probe fermions decoupled from the UV theory and thus
has no longer been restricted by unitarity bound. We also study finite density
fermions at finite temperature, with dynamical exponent $z=2$. We find that the
dispersion relation is linear but the logarithm of the spectral function is not
linearly related to the logarithm of $k_\bot =k-k_F$, independent of charge $q$
and $\theta$. Furthermore, we show that with the increasing of charge, new
branches of Fermi surfaces emerge and tend to gathering together to form a
shell-like structure when the charge reaches some critical value beyond which a
wide band pattern appears in the momentum-charge plane. However, all sharp
peaks will be smoothed out when $\theta$ increases, no matter how much large
the charge is.

thought to be the result of dynamical instabilities and gravitational
scattering among planets. Previously, it has been assumed that the orbits in
giant planet systems become gravitationally unstable after the gas nebula
dispersal. It was not well understood, however, how these unstable conditions
were established in the first place.
  In this work we numerically simulate the evolution of systems of three
planets as the planets sequentially grow to Jupiter's mass, and dynamically
interact among themselves and with the gas disk. We use the hydro-dynamical
code FARGO that we modified by implementing the $N$-body integrator SyMBA. The
new code can handle close encounters and collisions between planets. To test
their stability, the planetary systems were followed with SyMBA for up to
$10^8$ yr after the gas disk dispersal.
  We find that dynamics of the growing planets is complex, because migration
and resonances raise their orbital eccentricities, and cause dynamical
instabilities when gas is still around. If the dynamical instabilities occur
early, planets can be removed by collisions and ejections, and the system
rearranges into a new, more stable configuration. In this case, the planetary
systems emerging from the gas disks are expected to be stable, and would need
to be destabilized by other means (low-mass planets, planetesimal disks, etc.).
Alternatively, for the giant planet system to be intrinsically unstable upon
the gas disk dispersal, a special timing would be required with the growth of
(at least some of) the giant planets having to occur near the end of the gas
disk lifetime.

object detection. Nonetheless, there are many challenging problems arising in
training cascade detectors. One common issue is that the node classifier is
trained with a symmetric classifier. Having a low misclassification error rate
does not guarantee an optimal node learning goal in cascade classifiers, i.e.,
an extremely high detection rate with a moderate false positive rate. In this
work, we present a new approach to train an effective node classifier in a
cascade detector. The algorithm is based on two key observations: 1) Redundant
weak classifiers can be safely discarded; 2) The final detector should satisfy
the asymmetric learning objective of the cascade architecture. To achieve this,
we separate the classifier training into two steps: finding a pool of
discriminative weak classifiers/features and training the final classifier by
pruning weak classifiers which contribute little to the asymmetric learning
criterion (asymmetric classifier construction). Our model reduction approach
helps accelerate the learning time while achieving the pre-determined learning
objective. Experimental results on both face and car data sets verify the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. On the FDDB face data sets, our
approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance, which demonstrates the
advantage of our approach.

simultaneously from the nodes of the plane hexagonal lattice, which is
perpendicular to the external field, however the avalanches and streamers are
axially symmetric within a cylinder of radius R. It has been shown that under
certain conditions, the interaction between the streamers leads finally either
to the formation of two types of stationary ionization waves with corrugated

states of this type waves in the plane of parameter [Eo,R] has been presented

regions has been given. Characteristics of corrugated waves have been studied

maximum field strength at the front is large enough for the tunnel ionization
implementation. It has been shown that corrugated waves ionize semiconductor
more efficiently than flat ones, especially in relatively weak external fields.

different regimes of accretion that may result in a particular pulsar depending
on its luminosity - so-called sub- and super-critical regimes. We investigated
the behavior of the spectral parameters of the Be/X-ray binary system A

INTEGRAL and RXTE during the April 2010 outburst of the source. We analyzed the

polylogarithmic cuts of models of $\mathbf{V}^0$ are models of $\mathbf{VNC}^1$

strengthening of a result by Paris and Wilkie. We can then exploit our result
in Proof Complexity to observe that Frege proof systems can be sub
exponentially simulated by bounded depth Frege proof systems. This result has
recently been obtained by Filmus, Pitassi and Santhanam in a direct proof. As
an interesting observation we also obtain an average case separation of

conferencing facilitates virtual face-to-face communication with friends,
families and colleagues, via their mobile devices on the move. However, how to
provision high-quality, multi-party video conferencing experiences over mobile
devices is still an open challenge. The fundamental reason behind is the lack
of computation and communication capacities on the mobile devices, to scale to
large conferencing sessions. In this paper, we present vSkyConf, a
cloud-assisted mobile video conferencing system to fundamentally improve the
quality and scale of multi-party mobile video conferencing. By novelly
employing a surrogate virtual machine in the cloud for each mobile user, we
allow fully scalable communication among the conference participants via their
surrogates, rather than directly. The surrogates exchange conferencing streams
among each other, transcode the streams to the most appropriate bit rates, and
buffer the streams for the most efficient delivery to the mobile recipients. A
fully decentralized, optimal algorithm is designed to decide the best paths of
streams and the most suitable surrogates for video transcoding along the paths,
such that the limited bandwidth is fully utilized to deliver streams of the
highest possible quality to the mobile recipients. We also carefully tailor a
buffering mechanism on each surrogate to cooperate with optimal stream
distribution. We have implemented vSkyConf based on Amazon EC2 and verified the
excellent performance of our design, as compared to the widely adopted unicast
solutions.

ultrasound field (SURF) reverberation suppression transmit-pulse complexes.
Such propagation was previously studied in a homogeneous medium. Here instead
the propagation path includes a strongly aberrating body-wall modeled by a
sequence of delay-screens. The applied SURF transmit pulse complexes each
consist of a high-frequency imaging 3.5 MHz pulse combined with a low-frequency
0.5 MHz sound speed manipulation pulse. Furthermore, the feasibility of two
signal post-processing methods are investigated using the aberrated transmit
SURF beams. These methods are previously shown to adjust the depth of maximum
SURF reverberation suppression within a homogeneous medium. The request of the
study arises because imaging situations where reverberation suppression is
useful are also likely to produce pulse wave-front distortion (aberration).
Such distortions could potentially produce time-delays that cancel the
accumulated propagation time-delay needed for the SURF reverberation
suppression technique. Results show that both the generation of synthetic SURF
reverberation suppression imaging transmit-beams, and the following
post-processing adjustments, are attainable even when a body-wall introduces
time-delays which are larger than previously reported delays measured on human
body-wall specimens.

set-up convex constraint sets are distributed to the network processors who
have to compute the optimizer of a linear cost function subject to the
constraints. We propose a novel fully distributed algorithm, named
cutting-plane consensus, to solve the problem, based on an outer polyhedral
approximation of the constraint sets. Processors running the algorithm compute
and exchange linear approximations of their locally feasible sets.
Independently of the number of processors in the network, each processor stores
only a small number of linear constraints, making the algorithm scalable to
large networks. The cutting-plane consensus algorithm is presented and analyzed
for the general framework. Specifically, we prove that all processors running
the algorithm agree on an optimizer of the global problem, and that the
algorithm is tolerant to node and link failures as long as network connectivity
is preserved. Then, the cutting plane consensus algorithm is specified to three
different classes of distributed optimization problems, namely (i) inequality
constrained problems, (ii) robust optimization problems, and (iii) almost
separable optimization problems with separable objective functions and coupling
constraints. For each one of these problem classes we solve a concrete problem
that can be expressed in that framework and present computational results. That

and 208Pb nuclei. Thanks to the inclusion of the three-nucleon interaction and
despite the minimal optimization effort, a reasonable agreement with
experimental centroid energies of all three modes has been achieved. The role

Phi(x), from its stellar kinematics by adopting a fully non-parametric model
for the galaxy's unknown action-space distribution function, f(J). Having an
expression for the joint likelihood of Phi and f, the likelihood of Phi is
calculated by using a Dirichlet process mixture to represent the prior on f and
marginalising. We demonstrate that modelling machinery constructed using this
framework is successful at recovering the potentials of some simple systems
from perfect discrete kinematical data, a situation handled effortlessly by
traditional moment-based methods, such as the virial theorem, but in which
other, more modern, methods are less than satisfactory. We show how to
generalise the machinery to account for realistic observational errors and
selection functions. A practical implementation is likely to raise some
interesting algorithmic and computational challenges.

the brightest two foreground galaxies (unresolved at the natural seeing of
$0.8$ arcsec), placing the pair at $z=1.327$. We can rule out emission lines
contributing all of the observed broadband flux in $H_{160}$ band at
$70\sigma$, allowing us to exclude the $z\sim8$ candidate as a low redshift
interloper with broadband photometry dominated by strong emission lines. The
foreground galaxy pair lies at the peak of the luminosity, redshift and
separation distributions for deflectors of strongly lensed $z\sim8$ objects,
and we make a marginal detection of a demagnified secondary image in the
deepest ($J_{125}$) filter. We show that the configuration can be accurately
modelled by a singular isothermal ellipsoidal deflector and a S\'{e}rsic source
magnified by a factor of $\mu=4.3\pm0.2$. The reconstructed source in the
best-fitting model is consistent with luminosities and morphologies of $z\sim8$

current through the sample. The first regime is cooling of the ceramic to 77 K

and the second regime is cooling in the Earth's magnetic field with a
subsequent turning on and off of the excitation field. At an excitation field
up to 2000 A/m in these regimes two different types of macroscopic current
vortex structures, which generate the frozen field, are formed. The local
critical field of excitation when the vortex structure is formed in the second
regime exceeds the uniform perpendicular critical field of the slab by a factor
of 10 and equals 1700 A/m. On the other hand, the vortex structure of the first
type can be formed by practically any weak excitation field, including fields
smaller than the critical field of the vortex structure of the second type. In
a representation of the ceramic as a Josephson medium, physical models of the

that the strong correlation between amplitude and inclination can be used for

investigate the overall effect of the other orientation parameters, namely the
sky position and the polarisation angle. We find that after the inclination,
the ecliptic latitude of the source has the strongest effect in determining the
GW parameter uncertainties. We ascertain that the strong correlation we found
previously, only depends on the inclination of the source and not on the other
orientation parameters. We find that knowing the sky position of the source
from electromagnetic data can reduce the GW parameter uncertainty up to a
factor of $\sim 2$, depending on the inclination and the ecliptic latitude of
the system. Knowing the sky position and inclination can reduce the uncertainty
in amplitude by a factor larger than 40. We also find that unphysical errors in
the inclinations, which we found when using the Fisher matrix, can affect the
corresponding uncertainties in the amplitudes, which need to be corrected.

the astrophysics of high-energy cosmic ray electrons and positrons. The
anomalies, observed in the data of recent experiments (possible bump in the

discussed through the systematic use of simple analytical solutions of the
transport equations for cosmic ray electrons. Three main ways of explaining the
origin of the anomalies are considered: the conservative way supposing the
positrons to be pure secondary particles; the nearby sources like pulsars
origin; and the dark matter origin. This review discusses, also, the inability
to select the pulsars model or the dark matter model to explain the electron
anomalies on the basis of the electron spectra with the usual large energy
binning ($\gtrsim15%$). It is argued that the signature of nearby pulsars
origin of the anomalies against the dark matter origin could be the fine
structure of the cosmic ray electron spectrum predicted in the Malyshev et al.
paper (2009) and which was observed in the data from the high-resolution ATIC
experiment (2009-2011). To date, the high-resolution ATIC data was the only
experimental result of this type published in the literature. Therefore, they
should be tested by other experiments as soon as possible. Generally, there is,
also, rather controversial situations between the data of the majority of

studies have claimed an association between this variation and the motion of
the Sun around the Galaxy, invoking the modulation of cosmic rays, gamma rays
and comet impact frequency as a cause of this biodiversity variation. However,
some of these studies exhibit methodological problems, or were based on coarse
assumptions (such as a strict periodicity of the solar orbit). Here we
investigate this link in more detail, using a model of the Galaxy to
reconstruct the solar orbit and thus a predictive model of the temporal
variation of the extinction rate due to astronomical mechanisms. We compare
these predictions as well as those of various reference models with
paleontological data. Our approach involves Bayesian model comparison, which
takes into account the uncertainties in the paleontological data as well as the
distribution of solar orbits consistent with the uncertainties in the
astronomical data. We find that various versions of the orbital model are not
favored beyond simpler reference models. In particular, the distribution of
mass extinction events can be explained just as well by a uniform random
distribution as by any other model tested. Although our negative results on the
orbital model are robust to changes in the Galaxy model, the Sun's coordinates
and the errors in the data, we also find that it would be very difficult to
positively identify the orbital model even if it were the true one. (In
contrast, we do find evidence against simpler periodic models.) Thus while we
cannot rule out there being some connection between solar motion and
biodiversity variations on the Earth, we conclude that it is difficult to give
convincing positive conclusions of such a connection using current data.

(QKE) for studying dissipative dynamics in a general quantum network coupled
with an arbitrary thermal bath. The dynamics of system population is described
by a time-convoluted kinetic equation, where the time-nonlocal rate kernel is
systematically expanded on the order of off-diagonal elements of the system
Hamiltonian. In the second order, the rate kernel recovers the expression of
the noninteracting-blip approximation (NIBA) method. The higher-order
corrections in the rate kernel account for the effects of the multi-site
quantum coherence and the bath relaxation. In a quantum harmonic bath, the rate
kernels of different orders are analytically derived. As demonstrated by four
examples, the higher-order QKE can reliably predict quantum dissipative
dynamics, comparing well with the hierarchic equation approach. More
importantly, the higher-order rate kernels can distinguish and quantify
distinct nontrivial quantum coherent effects, such as long-range energy
transfer from quantum tunneling and quantum interference arising from the phase

tunnel junctions and phonon emission and detection occurs via quasiparticle
excitation and decay transitions that occur in the superconducting films. We
elaborate on the design geometry and constraints of the spectrometer, the
fabrication techniques, and the low-noise instrumentation that are essential
for successful application of this technique for nanoscale phonon studies. We
discuss the spectral distribution of phonons emitted by an STJ emitter and the
efficiency of their detection by an STJ detector. We demonstrate that the
phonons propagate ballistically through a silicon microstructure, and that
submicron spatial resolution is realizable in a design such as ours. Spectrally

devices such as filters deviate from their desired design behavior due to
component variations. Existing reconstruction algorithms are sensitive to such
deviations, which fall into the more general category of measurement matrix
perturbations. This paper proposes a model-based technique that aims to
calibrate filter model mismatches to facilitate improved signal reconstruction

enabling least-squares estimation of the impulse response error. The error
estimate and the known system model are used to calibrate the measurement

method even for highly deviating low-pass filter responses. The proposed method
performance is also compared to a state of the art method based on discrete

  system",,,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  ?In this work, we study the orbital stability of stationary solutions to the
relativistic Vlasov-Manev system. This system is a kinetic model describing the
evolution of a stellar system subject to its own gravity with some relativistic
corrections. For this system, the orbital stability was proved for isotropic
models constructed as minimizers of the Hamiltonian under a subcritical
condition. We obtain here this stability for all isotropic models by a
non-variationnal approach. We use here a new method developed in [23] for the
classical Vlasov-Poisson system. We derive the stability from the monotonicity
of the Hamiltonian under suitable generalized symmetric rearrangements and from
a Antonov type coer- civity property. We overcome here two new difficulties :
the first one is the a priori non-continuity of the potentials, from which a
greater control of the re- arrangements is necessary. The second difficulty is
related to the homogeneity breaking which does not give the boundedness of the
kinetic energy. Indeed, in this paper, we does not suppose any subcritical
condition satisfied by the steady states.

meta-heuristic for solving continuous optimization problems. However, when
running the PSO algorithm, one encounters the phenomenon of so-called
stagnation, that means in our context, the whole swarm starts to converge to a
solution that is not (even a local) optimum. The goal of this work is to point
out possible reasons why the swarm stagnates at these non-optimal points. To
achieve our results, we use the newly defined potential of a swarm. The total
potential has a portion for every dimension of the search space, and it drops
when the swarm approaches the point of convergence. As it turns out
experimentally, the swarm is very likely to come sometimes into ""unbalanced""
states, i. e., almost all potential belongs to one axis. Therefore, the swarm
becomes blind for improvements still possible in any other direction. Finally,
we show how in the light of the potential and these observations, a slightly
adapted PSO rebalances the potential and therefore increases the quality of the
solution.

interpretation, bridging the gap between numerical simulations and

application of MHD seismology. In this work we aim at determining the
characteristics of the fast MHD sausage mode in the corona on the modulation of
observable quantities such as line intensity and spectral line broadening.
Effects of line-of-sight angle, and spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions
are considered. We take a cylindrical tube simulating a loop in a low-{\beta}
coronal environment with an optically thin background, and let it oscillate
with the fast sausage mode. A parametric study is performed. Among other
results, we show that regardless of the ionisation state of the plasma, the
variation of spectral line broadening can be significant, even for low
intensity modulation. The nature of this broadening is not thermal but is
mostly turbulent. This places spectrometers in clear advantage over imaging
instruments for the detection of the sausage mode. The modulation of all
quantities is considerably affected by the line-of-sight angle, and especially
by the spatial and temporal resolution when these are on the order of the
mode's wavelength and period. This places high constraints on instrumentation.

With a boundary value problem involving such conditions we associate the

companions. Since neutron star + He star binaries may experience
common-envelope evolution, they have some advantage to account for the
formation of short orbital-period IMBPs. In this work, we explore the
probability of IMBPs formed by this evolutionary channel. Using Eggleton's
stellar evolution code, considering that the dead pulsars were spun up by the
accreting material and angular momentum from the He star companions, we have
calculated the evolution of a large number of neutron star + He star binaries.
Our simulated results indicate that, the NS + He star evolutionary channel can
produce IMBPs with a WD of $\sim0.5 - 1.1 M_{\odot}$ and an orbital period of
$0.03 - 20$ d, in which pulsars have a spin-period of $1.4 - 200$ ms. Comparing
the calculated results with the observational parameters (spin period and
orbital period) of 9 compact IMBPs, the NS + He star evolutionary channel can
account for the formation of 4 sources. Therefore, NS + He star binaries offer
an alternative evolutionary channel to compact IMBPs.

discrepancies among all the works present in literature. This is surprising
because they are both derived from the analysis of dark-matter halos forming in
LCDM simulations with similar set-ups. With the help of analytic models and
numerical simulations we investigate the origin of this discrepancy focusing on
the procedures used to derive the concentrations (circular velocity ratios
versus density profile fitting) and on the selection criteria used to bin the
halos (binning in maximum circular velocity versus binning in mass). We find
that both steps of the analysis have a large impact on the resulting c-M
relation. In particular, we show that the two c-M relations can be entirely
reconciled, if we account for these methodological differences. Our analysis
demonstrates that the concentration estimates are sensitive to the largely
different radial scales probed by a particular measurement method. This implies
that concentrations derived with different techniques (both in observations and
in simulations) must be compared over the same radial range.

observed by EGRET and Fermi and find that for six sources the average flux
varied by more than an order of magnitude. For two of these sources (PKS
0208-512 and PKS 0528+134), there were extensive observations (at various
observing periods) by EGRET. Hence these dramatic variations are not due to a
single short time-scale flare, but reflect long term changes in the average
flux. Over the last twenty years, these two sources were also the target of
several X-ray observatories (e.g. ROSAT, ASCA, RXTE, BeppoSAX, Chandra, Suzaku,
XMM-Newton and Swift). While the ratios of the average gamma-ray fluxes between
EGRET and Fermi observations are 22.9 +/- 1.9 and 12.6 +/- 1.5, their estimated
2-10 keV X-ray flux do not show such dramatic variations. The X-ray emission
from such flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) are believed to be due to
synchrotron self Compton, while gamma-rays originate from inverse
Comptonization of external soft photons from an accretion disk and/or broad
line region. We argue that in this scenario, the only explanation for the
uncorrelated variability is that there was an order of magnitude decrease in
the external soft photons, while the jet parameters remained more or less
constant. This result indicates that perhaps the accretion and jet processes
are not tightly coupled in these sources.

manifolds in an appropriate 0-Gevrey class, with trapped sets consisting of
only finitely many components. We prove that the high-frequency resolvent is
either bounded by $C_\epsilon |\lambda|^\epsilon$ for any $\epsilon>0$, or
blows up faster than any polynomial (at least along a subsequence). A stronger
result holds if the manifold is analytic. The method of proof is to exploit the
warped product structure to separate variables, obtaining a one-dimensional
semiclassical Schr\""odinger operator. We then classify the microlocal resolvent
behaviour associated to every possible type of critical value of the potential,
and translate this into the associated resolvent estimates. Weakly stable
trapping admits highly concentrated quasimodes and fast growth of the
resolvent. Conversely, using a delicate inhomogeneous blowup procedure loosely
based on the classical positive commutator argument, we show that any weakly
unstable trapping forces at least some spreading of quasimodes.
  As a first application, we conclude that either there is a resonance free
region of size $| \Im \lambda | \leq C_\epsilon | \Re \lambda |^{-1-\epsilon}$
for any $\epsilon>0$, or there is a sequence of resonances converging to the
real axis faster than any polynomial. Again, a stronger result holds if the
manifold is analytic. As a second application, we prove a spreading result for
weak quasimodes in partially rectangular billiards.

evidence for a common pattern underlying diverse behavioral phenomena: words
follow Zipf's law of brevity (the tendency of more frequently used words to be
shorter), and conformity to this general pattern has been seen in the behavior
of a number of other animals. It has been argued that the presence of this law

strong direct connection has been demonstrated between the law and compression,
the information theoretic principle of minimizing the expected length of a

length of a word cannot increase as its frequency increases. Furthermore, we
show that the mean code length or duration is significantly small in human

agreement with the law of brevity has been found. We argue that compression is
a general principle of animal behavior, that reflects selection for efficiency

repolarize them when moving. At a low spin relaxation rate and at low bias
currents vortices carrying magnetic polarization clouds become polaron-like and
their velocities are determined by the effective drag coefficient which is
significantly bigger than the Bardeen-Stephen (BS) one. As current increases,
vortices release polarization clouds and the velocity as well as the voltage in
the I-V characteristics jump to values corresponding to the BS drag coefficient
at a critical current $J_c$. The nonuniform components of the magnetic field
and magnetization drop as velocity increases resulting in weaker polarization
and {\it discontinuous} dynamic dissociation depinning transition.
Experimentally the jump shows up as a depinning transition and the
corresponding current at the jump is the depinning current. As current
decreases, on the way back, vortices are retrapped by polarization clouds at
the current $J_r<J_c$. As a result, polaronic effect suppresses dissipation and
enhances critical current. Borocarbides (RE)Ni$_2$B$_2$C with a short
penetration length and highly polarizable rare earth spins seem to be optimal
systems for a detailed study of vortex polaron formation by measuring I-V
characteristics. We propose also to use superconductor-magnet multilayer
structure to study polaronic mechanism of pinning with the goal to achieve high
critical currents. The magnetic layers should have large magnetic
susceptibility to enhance the coupling between vortices and magnetization in
magnetic layers while the relaxation of the magnetization should be slow. For
Nb and proper magnet multilayer structure, we estimate the critical current
density $J_c\sim 10^{9}\ \rm{A/m^2}$ at magnetic field $B\approx 1$ T.

couplings mixes neutrinos in an individual brane, while Dirac-type couplings
mixes neutrinos across the brares. We first focus our attention in a single
brane. The mass matrix, determined by the Majorana mass, leads to mass
eigenstates and further to mixing angles identical to the mixing angles
proposed by the tri-bimaximal mixing. When we include the Dirac-type coupling,
connecting the two branes, we obtain a definite prediction for the transition
to a sterile neutrino (right-handed neutrino). With m_L (m_R) the Majorana mass

12 program stars turned out to show remarkably small star-to-star dispersions
(<~0.1-0.2dex) without any significant dependence upon the pulsation period:
near-solar Fe ([Fe/H] ~0.0), moderately underabundant C ([C/H] -0.3),
appreciably overabundant N ([N/H] ~+0.4-0.5), and mildly supersolar Na ([Na/H]
+0.2). We conclude the following implications from these observational facts:
(1) These CNO abundance trends can be interpreted mainly as due to the
canonical dredge-up of CN-cycled material, while any significant non-canonical
deep mixing of ON-cycled gas is ruled out (though only a slight mixing may
still be possible). (2) The mild but definite overabundance of Na suggests that
the NeNa-cycle product is also dredged up. (3) The extent of mixing-induced
peculiarities in the envelope of Cepheid variables is essentially independent
on the absolute magnitude; i.e., also on the stellar mass.

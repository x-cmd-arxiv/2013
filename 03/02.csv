signal at the LHC that should be measured under the spin-two and different
spin-zero hypotheses. The spin-two prediction exceeds by an order of magnitude
the upper limits established by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations, which are
consistent with the minimal $0^+$ prediction, thereby providing {\it secunda
facie} evidence against spin-two Higgs impostors. Similar analyses of energy
dependences provide evidence against $0^-$ impostors, non-minimal scalar boson
couplings, including the best LHC limits on dimension-six operators. Comparing
the LHC vector boson fusion cross sections at 7 and 8 TeV in the centre of mass
provides additional but weaker evidence in favour of the identification of the

Key Distribution (QKD). In this paper, we study security of an ITS
authentication scheme proposed by Wegman & Carter, in the case of partially
known authentication key. This scheme uses a new authentication key in each
authentication attempt, to select a hash function from an Almost Strongly
Universal$_2$ hash function family. The partial knowledge of the attacker is
measured as the trace distance between the authentication key distribution and
the uniform distribution; this is the usual measure in QKD. We provide direct
proofs of security of the scheme, when using partially known key, first in the
information-theoretic setting and then in terms of witness indistinguishability
as used in the Universal Composability (UC) framework. We find that if the
authentication procedure has a failure probability $\epsilon$ and the
authentication key has an $\epsilon'$ trace distance to the uniform, then under
ITS, the adversary's success probability conditioned on an authentic
message-tag pair is only bounded by $\epsilon+|\mT|\epsilon'$, where $|\mT|$ is
the size of the set of tags. Furthermore, the trace distance between the
authentication key distribution and the uniform increases to $|\mT|\epsilon'$
after having seen an authentic message-tag pair. Despite this, we are able to
prove directly that the authenticated channel is indistinguishable from an
(ideal) authentic channel (the desired functionality), except with probability
less than $\epsilon+\epsilon'$. This proves that the scheme is
($\epsilon+\epsilon'$)-UC-secure, without using the composability theorem.

equations are used, so that the results apply not only to Einstein's gravity

III_i, D(a), D(b), D(c) and D(d). The corresponding conditions are surprisingly
clear and expressed in an invariant geometric form. Some of them are always
satisfied in four dimensions. To illustrate our classification scheme, we apply

a bounded sample space, a coupled nonlinear diffusion process is required: the
Wiener-processes in the equivalent system of stochastic differential equations
are multiplicative with coefficients dependent on all the stochastic variables.
Individual samples of a discrete ensemble, obtained from the stochastic
process, satisfy a unit-sum constraint at all times. The process may be used to
represent realizations of a fluctuating ensemble of N variables subject to a
conservation principle. Similar to the multivariate Wright-Fisher process,
whose invariant is also Dirichlet, the univariate case yields a process whose
invariant is the beta distribution. As a test of the results, Monte-Carlo
simulations are used to evolve numerical ensembles toward the invariant
Dirichlet distribution.

size from 1.8 to 4.2 times the radius of Earth. Five of these planets orbit in
a tightly-packed configuration with periods between 10 and 47 days. We perform
a dynamical analysis of the system based upon transit timing variations
observed in more than three years of \ik photometric data. Stellar parameters
are derived using a combination of spectral classification and constraints on
the star's density derived from transit profiles together with planetary
eccentricity vectors provided by our dynamical study. Combining masses of the
planets relative to the star from our dynamical study and radii of the planets
relative to the star from transit depths together with deduced stellar
properties yields measurements of the radii of all six planets, masses of the
five inner planets, and an upper bound to the mass of the outermost planet,
whose orbital period is 118 days. We find mass-radius combinations for all six
planets that imply that substantial fractions of their volumes are occupied by
constituents that are less dense than rock. The Kepler-11 system contains the
lowest mass exoplanets for which both mass and radius have been measured.

dealt with, where each of the $n$ user nodes $X_1,$ $X_2,...,X_n$ wishes to
communicate its messages to all the other $(n-1)$ nodes with the help of the
relay node R. The given scheme, based on the denoise-and-forward scheme
proposed for two-way relaying by Popovski et al. in \cite{PoY1}, employs two
phases: Multiple Access (MA) phase and Broadcast (BC) phase with each phase
utilizing one channel use and hence totally two channel uses. Physical layer
network-coding using the denoise-and-forward scheme was done for the two-way
relaying scenario in\cite{KPT}, for three-way relaying scenario in \cite{SVR},
and for four-way relaying scenario in \cite{ShR}. This paper employs
denoise-and-forward scheme for physical layer network coding of the $n$-way
relaying scenario illustrating with the help of the case $n = 5$ not dealt with
so far. It is observed that adaptively changing the network coding map used at
the relay according to the channel conditions reduces the impact of multiple
access interference which occurs at the relay during the MA phase. These
network coding maps are chosen so that they satisfy a requirement called
\textit{exclusive law}. We show that when the $n$ users transmit points from
the same $M$-PSK $(M=2^{\lambda})$ constellation, every such network coding map
that satisfies the exclusive law can be represented by a $n$-fold Latin
Hyper-Cube of side $M$. The singular fade subspaces resulting from the scheme
are described and enumerated for general values of $n$ and $M$ and are
classified based on their removability in the given scenario. A network code
map to be used by the relay for the BC phase aiming at reducing the effect of
interference at the MA stage is obtained.

phase transition using the two-loop Phi-derivable approximation of the
effective potential and compare our results to those obtained in the literature
within the Hartree-Fock approximation. In particular, we find that in the
chiral limit the transition is of the second order, whereas it was found to be
of the first order in the Hartree-Fock case. These features are manifest at the
level of the thermodynamical observables. We also compute the thermal sigma and
pion masses from the curvature of the effective potential. In the chiral limit,
this guarantees that the Goldstone's theorem is obeyed in the broken phase. A
realistic parametrization of the model in the N=4 case, based on the vacuum
values of the curvature masses, shows that a sigma mass of around 450 MeV can
be obtained. The equations are renormalized after extending our previous
results for the N=1 case by means of the general procedure described in [J.
Berges et al., Annals Phys. 320, 344-398 (2005)]. When restricted to the
Hartree-Fock approximation, our approach reveals that certain problems raised
in the literature concerning the renormalization are completely lifted.
Finally, we introduce a new type of Phi-derivable approximation in which the
gap equation is not solved at the same level of accuracy as the accuracy at
which the potential is computed. We discuss the consistency and applicability
of these types of ""hybrid"" approximations and illustrate them in the two-loop
case by showing that the corresponding effective potential is renormalizable
and that the transition remains of the second order.

metallic regime by the divergence of the local Bethe-Salpeter equation in the
charge channel. At low temperatures this occurs in the region where incoherent
high-energy features emerge in the spectral function, while at high
temperatures it is traceable up to the atomic-limit.

that each sub-family form a partition of the $n$-element set, where $n$ is

the first purely combinatorial construction of locally decodable codes. Locally
decodable codes are error-correcting codes that allow the recovery of any

provide valuable information about the still uncertain properties of cold
matter at supranuclear densities. One promising approach to making such
measurements involves analysis of the X-ray flux oscillations often seen during
thermonuclear (type 1) X-ray bursts. These oscillations are almost certainly
produced by emission from hotter regions on the stellar surface modulated by
the rotation of the star. One consequence of the rotation is that the
oscillation should appear earlier at higher photon energies than at lower
energies. Ford (1999) found compelling evidence for such a hard lead in the
tail oscillations of one type 1 burst from Aql X-1. We have therefore analyzed
individually the oscillations observed in the tails of the four type 1 bursts
from 4U 1636-536 that, when averaged, provided the strongest evidence for a
soft lead in the analysis by Muno et al. (2003). We have also analyzed the
oscillation observed during the superburst from this star. We find that the
data from these five bursts, treated both individually and jointly, are fully
consistent with a rotating hot spot model. Unfortunately, the uncertainties in
these data are too large to provide interesting constraints on the mass and

four-dimensional gauged supergravities, generated by so-called non-geometric
fluxes, have been argued to find a higher-dimensional origin in these

present here recent results clarifying the relation between these two settings.
Thanks to a field redefinition, we reformulate the NSNS Lagrangian in such a
way that the non-geometric fluxes appear in ten dimensions. In addition, if an
NSNS field configuration is non-geometric, its reformulation in terms of the
new fields can restore a standard geometry. A dimensional reduction is then
possible, and leads to the non-geometric terms in the four-dimensional

understanding of the role of the non-geometric fluxes, and rewrite the

the relevance of the field redefinition and the non-geometric fluxes when

Here we outline the information required to determine the sample completeness,

is the issue of transit signal recovery. We investigate the extent to which the
Kepler pipeline preserves individual transit signals by injecting simulated
transits into the pixel-level data, processing the modified pixels through the
pipeline, and comparing the measured transit signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to
that expected without perturbation by the pipeline. We inject simulated transit
signals across the full focal plane for a set of observations of length 89
days. On average, we find that the SNR of the injected signal is recovered at
MS = 0.9973(+/-0.0012)xBS-0.0151(+/-0.0049), where MS is the measured SNR and
BS is the baseline, or expected, SNR. The 1{\sigma} width of the distribution
around this correlation is +/-2.64%. We discuss the pipeline processes that
cause the measured SNR to deviate significantly from the baseline SNR; these
are primarily the handling of data adjacent to spacecraft re-pointings and the
removal of harmonics prior to the measurement of the SNR. Finally we outline

After the first few picoseconds the grating decays primarily due to ambipolar
diffusion. While at low density we observe a regime in which the ambipolar
diffusion is electron-dominated and increases rapidly with n, at high n it
appears to saturate at 34 cm2/s. We present a simple calculation that
reproduces the main results of our measurements as well as of previously
published measurements that had shown diffusion to be a flat or decreasing
function of n. By accounting for effect of density on charge susceptibility we
show that, in p-type semiconductors, the regime we observe of increasing
ambipolar diffusion is unique to heavy doping and low temperature, where both
the holes and electrons are degenerate; in this regime the electronic and
ambipolar diffusion are nearly equal. The saturation is identified as a
crossover to ambipolar diffusion dominated by the majority carriers, the holes.

system, or when a flat disc is made unstable by external forces. The evolution
of the shape and mass distribution of a warped disc is driven not only by
external influences but also by an internal torque, which transports angular
momentum through the disc. This torque depends on internal flows driven by the
oscillating pressure gradient associated with the warp, and on physical
processes operating on smaller scales, which may include instability and
turbulence. We introduce a local model for the detailed study of warped discs.
Starting from the shearing sheet of Goldreich & Lynden-Bell, we impose the
oscillating geometry of the orbital plane by means of a coordinate
transformation. This warped shearing sheet (or box) is suitable for analytical
and computational treatments of fluid dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, etc., and
it can be used to compute the internal torque that drives the large-scale
evolution of the disc. The simplest hydrodynamic states in the local model are
horizontally uniform laminar flows that oscillate at the orbital frequency.
These correspond to the nonlinear solutions for warped discs found in previous
work by Ogilvie, and we present an alternative derivation and generalization of
that theory. In a companion paper we show that these laminar flows are often
linearly unstable, especially if the disc is nearly Keplerian and of low
viscosity. The local model can be used in future work to determine the
nonlinear outcome of the hydrodynamic instability of warped discs, and its
interaction with others such as the magnetorotational instability.

generated, which cause the warp to evolve rapidly, in some cases at a rate that
is inversely proportional to the viscosity. However, these flows are often
subject to a linear hydrodynamic instability, which may produce small-scale
turbulence and modify the large-scale dynamics of the disc. We use a warped
shearing sheet to compute the oscillatory laminar flows in a warped disc and to
analyse their linear stability by the Floquet method. We find widespread
hydrodynamic instability deriving from the parametric resonance of inertial

second-order field equations following from a covariant Lagrangian in four

different theories are entirely accounted for by differences in the body's
effective mass and charges in those different theories. Previously the process
of computing the mass and charges for a particular body was left implicit, to
be determined in each particular theory as the need arises. I now obtain
explicit expressions for the mass and charges of a body as surface integrals of
the fields it generates, where the integrand is constructed from the symplectic

motion of a small body to be written down in a few lines, in a manner universal
across bodies and theories. For simplicity I restrict to scalar and vector
fields (in addition to the metric), but there is no obstacle to treating
higher-rank tensor fields. I explicitly apply the prescription to work out
specific equations for various body types in Einstein gravity, generalized
Brans-Dicke theory (in both Jordan and Einstein frames), Einstein-Maxwell

synchronization in shared-memory programs. Requiring program- mers to signal
threads explicitly results in many concurrency bugs due to missed
notifications, or notifications on wrong condition variables. In this paper, we
describe an implementation of an au- tomatic signaling monitor in Java called
AutoSynch that eliminates such concurrency bugs by removing the burden of
signaling from the programmer. We show that the belief that automatic signaling
monitors are prohibitively expensive is wrong. For most problems, programs
based on AutoSynch are almost as fast as those based on explicit signaling. For
some, AutoSynch is even faster than explicit signaling because it never uses
signalAll, whereas the programmers end up using signalAll with the explicit
signal mechanism. AutoSynch achieves efficiency in synchronization based on
three novel ideas. We introduce an operation called globalization that enables
the predicate evaluation in every thread, thereby reducing context switches
during the execution of the program. Secondly, AutoSynch avoids signalAll by
using a property called relay invari- ance that guarantees that whenever
possible there is always at least one thread whose condition is true which has
been signaled. Finally, AutoSynch uses a technique called predicate tagging to
efficiently determine a thread that should be signaled. To evaluate the effi-
ciency of AutoSynch, we have implemented many different well- known
synchronization problems such as the producers/consumers problem, the
readers/writers problems, and the dining philosophers problem. The results show
that AutoSynch is almost as efficient as the explicit-signal monitor and even
more efficient for some cases.

the giant impact that forms the Pluto-Charon binary. After the impact, Pluto
and Charon accrete some of the debris and eject the rest from the binary orbit.
During the ejection, high velocity collisions among debris particles produce a
collisional cascade, leading to the ejection of some debris from the system and
enabling the remaining debris particles to find stable orbits around the
binary. Our numerical simulations of coagulation and migration show that
collisional evolution within a ring or a disk of debris leads to a few small
satellites orbiting Pluto-Charon. These simulations are the first to
demonstrate migration-induced mergers within a particle disk. The final
satellite masses correlate with the initial disk mass. More massive disks tend
to produce fewer satellites. For the current properties of the satellites, our
results strongly favor initial debris masses of 3-10 x 10^{19} g and current
satellite albedos of roughly 0.4-1. We also predict an ensemble of smaller

scales, in high-resolution simulations with explicitly resolved GMCs and
stellar feedback. We compare: (1) a self-gravity criterion (based on the local
virial parameter and the assumption that self-gravitating gas collapses to high
density in a free-fall time), (2) a fixed density threshold, (3) a
molecular-gas law, (4) a temperature threshold, (5) a Jeans-instability
requirement, (6) a criteria that cooling times be shorter than dynamical times,
and (7) a convergent-flow criterion. We consider these both MW-like and
high-density (starburst) galaxies. With feedback present, all models produce
identical integrated star formation rates (SFRs), in agreement with the
Kennicutt relation. Without feedback all produce orders-of-magnitude excessive
SFRs. This is totally dependent on feedback and independent of the SF law.
However, the spatial and density distribution of SF depend strongly on the SF
criteria. Because cooling rates are generally fast and gas is turbulent,
criteria (4)-(7) are 'weak' and spread SF uniformly over the disk (above
densities n~0.01-0.1 cm^-3). A molecular criterion (3) localizes to higher
densities, but still a wide range; for Z Z_solar, it is similar to a density
threshold at n~1 cm^-3 (well below mean densities in the MW center or
starbursts). Fixed density thresholds (2) can always select the highest
densities, but must be adjusted for simulation resolution and galaxy
properties; the same threshold that works in a MW-like simulation will select
nearly all gas in a starburst. Binding criteria (1) tend to adaptively select
the largest over-densities, independent of galaxy model or resolution, and
automatically predict clustered SF. We argue that this SF model is most
physically-motivated and presents significant numerical advantages in
large-dynamic range simulations.

traditional cluster number counts and observable-mass relation analyses,
significantly improving their constraining power by breaking existing
calibration degeneracies. We use the maxBCG galaxy clusters catalogue to
constrain cosmological parameters and cross-calibrate the mass-observable
relation, using cluster abundances in richness bins and weak-lensing mass
estimates. We then add the redshift-space power spectrum of the sample,
including an effective modelling of the weakly non-linear contribution and
allowing for an arbitrary photometric redshift smoothing. The inclusion of the

$\sigma_8$ and the matter density $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}$. Finally, we apply this

observations of star-forming galaxies in Compact Groups. In this first paper
dedicated to the project, we present the analysis of the spiral galaxy NGC838,
a member of the Hickson Compact Group 16, and of its galactic wind. Our
observations reveal that the wind forms an asymmetric, bipolar, rotating
structure, powered by a nuclear starburst. Emission line ratio diagnostics
indicate that photoionization is the dominant excitation mechanism at the base
of the wind. Mixing from slow shocks (up to 20%) increases further out along
the outflow axis. The asymmetry of the wind is most likely caused by one of the
two lobes of the wind bubble bursting out of its HI envelope, as indicated by
line ratios and radial velocity maps. The characteristics of this galactic wind
suggest that it is caught early (a few Myr) in the wind evolution sequence. The
wind is also quite different to the galactic wind in the partner galaxy NGC839
which contains a symmetric, shock-excited wind. Assuming that both galaxies
have similar interaction histories, the two different winds must be a
consequence of the intrinsic properties of NGC838 and NGC839 and their
starbursts.

demonstrate reliable redshift recoveries using linear clustering assumptions
well into the non-linear regime for redshift distributions of narrow redshift
width. Including information from intermediate physical scales balances the
increased information available from clustering and the residual bias incurred
from relaxing of linear constraints. We discuss how breaking a broad sample

effects of atmospheric and deep-interior heating at the same power levels and
derive the power required to achieve a given radius increase when night-side
cooling is incorporated. We find that models that include consistent day/night
cooling are more similar to isotropically irradiated models when there is more
heat redistributed from the dayside to the nightside. In addition, we consider
the efficacy of ohmic heating in the atmosphere and/or convective interior in
inflating hot Jupiters. Among our conclusions are that (i) the most highly

published data on the kinematics and morphology of dwarf galaxies, motivated by
the theoretical work of Hui et al. (2009) and Jain and Vanderplas (2011). In a
wide class of gravity theories a scalar field couples to matter and provides an
attractive fifth force. Due to their different self-gravity, stars and gas may
respond differently to the scalar force leading to several observable
deviations from standard gravity. HI gas, red giant stars and main sequence
stars can be displaced relative to each other, and the stellar disk can display
warps or asymmetric rotation curves aligned with external potential gradients.
To distinguish the effects of modified gravity from standard astrophysical
phenomena, we use a control sample of galaxies that are expected to be screened
from the fifth force. In all cases we find no significant deviation from the
null hypothesis of general relativity. The limits obtained from dwarf galaxies
are not yet competitive with the limits from cepheids obtained in our first
paper, but can be improved to probe regions of parameter space that are
inaccessible using other tests. We discuss how our methodology can be applied

This paper considers the cases when transmission takes place over additive
white Gaussian noise (AWGN)channels and Rayleigh fast-fading channels. The
technique of upper bounding the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) decoding performance
of LDPC codes using an area theorem is extended for BICM schemes. The upper
bound is computed for both the optimal MAP demapper and the suboptimal
max-log-MAP (MLM) demapper. It is observed that this bound approaches the noise
threshold of BICM channels for regular LDPC codes with large degrees. The rest
of the paper extends these techniques to SC-LDPC codes and the phenomenon of
threshold saturation is demonstrated numerically. Based on numerical evidence,
we conjecture that the belief-propagation (BP) decoding threshold of SC-LDPC
codes approaches the MAP decoding threshold of the underlying LDPC ensemble on
BICM channels. Numerical results also show that SC-LDPC codes approach the BICM
capacity over different channels and modulation schemes.

Sep/Oct 2012. The first epoch shows the same general spectral characteristics
as the later epochs (smooth continuum, narrow H and HeI emission lines), but
the IR continuum shape is substantially redder than the later epochs. The epoch
1 continuum can be approximated by reddening the peak-luminosity (epoch 3)
spectrum by E(B-V)=1.0 mag, but the blue color seen in visual-wavelength
spectra at the same time indicates that strong wavelength-dependent extinction
by circumstellar dust is not the correct explanation. Instead, we favor the
hypothesis that the redder color before the brightening arises from excess
emission from hot $\sim$2000 K circumstellar dust. The minimum radius (120 AU)
deduced from the dust temperature and observed luminosity of the transient,
combined with the observed expansion speed in the precursor outbursts of SN
2009ip, is consistent with an ejection at least 1.1 yr earlier. The mass of hot
dust indicated by the IR excess is 4x10$^{-7}$ Msun, although this is only a
lower limit since the near-IR data do not constrain the mass of cooler dust.
Thus, the observed pre-SN outbursts of this object were able to efficiently
form dust into which the SN ejecta and radiation now propagate. This is
consistent with the notion that the same pre-SN eruptions that generally give
rise to SNe IIn also give rise to the dust needed for their commonly observed
IR echoes. We also discuss some aspects of the IR line profiles, including HeI
10830.

space is developed using interference patterns between two oscillated spectra
at different baselines. This method is used to investigate the potential
sensitivity of the Double Chooz experiment, which has a single Near Detector at
distances of 351 m and 465 m from two reactors of identical design. We conclude
that Double Chooz could investigate sterile neutrino in the $\Delta m^{2}$
range of 0.002 to 0.5 eV$^2$ over 5 years of near detector running.

opinion holders adopt a proselytic strategy, converting their neighbors through
personal interactions, and relax to the orthodox opinion according to its
representation in the population. We give a full description of the phase
diagram of this asymmetric model, using the standard pair approximation
equations and assessing their performance by comparison with stochastic

the symmetric case, the asymmetric model also features an active phase. We
study the stochastic properties of the corresponding metastable state in
finite-size networks, discussing the applicability of the analytic
approximations developed for the coevolutionary voter model. We find that, in

the system's parameters and independent of initial conditions for sufficiently

significantly reducing convergence times and by changing their scaling with

the best performing member of the clubs it is a member of. Clubs membership is
dynamic, where the worst performing particles socialize more by joining more
clubs to learn from other particles and the best performing particles are made
to socialize less by leaving clubs to reduce their strong influence on other
members. Particles return gradually to default membership level when they stop
showing extreme performance. Inertia weights of swarm members are made random
within a predefined range. This proposed dynamic neighborhood algorithm is
compared with other two algorithms having static neighborhood topologies on a

weakly bound nuclei is necessary to guide the development of new theoretical
approaches that combine nuclear structure with reaction dynamics.
  Purpose: The resonant structure of 8B is studied in this work.
  Method: Excitation functions for elastic and inelastic 7Be+p scattering were
measured using a 7Be rare isotope beam. Excitation energies ranging between 1.6
and 3.4 MeV were investigated. An R-matrix analysis of the excitation functions
was performed.
  Results: New low-lying resonances at 1.9, 2.5, and 3.3 MeV in 8B are reported
with spin-parity assignment 0+, 2+, and 1+, respectively. Comparison to the
Time Dependent Continuum Shell (TDCSM) model and ab initio no-core shell
model/resonating-group method (NCSM/RGM) calculations is performed. This work
is a more detailed analysis of the data first published as a Rapid
Communication. [J.P. Mitchell, et al, Phys. Rev. C 82, 011601(R) (2010)]
  Conclusions: Identification of the 0+, 2+, 1+ states that were predicted by
some models at relatively low energy but never observed experimentally is an
important step toward understanding the structure of 8B. Their identification
was aided by having both elastic and inelastic scattering data. Direct
comparison of the cross sections and phase shifts predicted by the TDCSM and ab

unavoidable noise pervading the data, such as the presence of homonymous
individuals in social networks. In the current paper, we investigate the
problem of name disambiguation in collaborative networks, a task that plays a
fundamental role on a myriad of scientific contexts. In special, we use an
unsupervised technique which relies on a particle competition mechanism in a
networked environment to detect the clusters. It has been shown that, in this
kind of environment, the learning process can be improved because the network
representation of data can capture topological features of the input data set.
Specifically, in the proposed disambiguating model, a set of particles is
randomly spawned into the nodes constituting the network. As time progresses,
the particles employ a movement strategy composed of a probabilistic convex
mixture of random and preferential walking policies. In the former, the walking
rule exclusively depends on the topology of the network and is responsible for
the exploratory behavior of the particles. In the latter, the walking rule
depends both on the topology and the domination levels that the particles
impose on the neighboring nodes. This type of behavior compels the particles to
perform a defensive strategy, because it will force them to revisit nodes that
are already dominated by them, rather than exploring rival territories.
Computer simulations conducted on the networks extracted from the arXiv
repository of preprint papers and also from other databases reveal the
effectiveness of the model, which turned out to be more accurate than
traditional clustering methods.

address this deficiency by consolidating Mount Wilson Observatory polar faculae

with facular data counted automatically from MDI intensitygrams, and
calibrating it against polar field measurements taken by the Wilcox Solar

measurements to study the role of the polar magnetic flux in the evolution of
the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF). We find that there is a strong
correlation between HMF and polar flux at solar minimum and that, taken
together, polar flux and sunspot area are better at explaining the evolution of

The approach is based on three types of statistical measurements, i.e. obtained
from first-order statistics of word properties in a text, from the topology of
complex networks representing text, and from intermittency concepts where text
is treated as a time series. Comparative experiments were performed with the
New Testament in 15 different languages and with distinct books in English and

the language and on the story being told in the book. The metrics found to be

assortativity, degree and selectivity of words. As an illustration, we analyze

that it is mostly compatible with natural languages and incompatible with

sunspots observed on the Sun's surface vary periodically, going through
successive maxima and minima. Following sunspot cycle 23, the Sun went into a
prolonged minimum characterized by a very weak polar magnetic field and an
unusually large number of days without sunspots. Sunspots are strongly
magnetized regions and are generated by a dynamo mechanism which recreates the
solar polar field mediated via plasma flows. Here we report results from
kinematic dynamo simulations which demonstrate that a fast meridional flow in
the early half of a cycle, followed by a slower flow in the latter half,
reproduces both the characteristics of the minimum of sunspot cycle 23 - a
large number of spotless days and a relatively weak polar field. Our model
predicts that, in general, very deep minima are associated with weak polar
fields. Sunspots govern the solar radiative energy and radio flux, and in
conjunction with the polar field, modulate the solar wind, heliospheric open

causal link between solar internal dynamics and the atypical values of these

clusters, as the concept of similarity may depend on the purpose of the task.
For instance, in topic extraction similar texts mean those within the same
semantic field, whereas in author recognition stylistic features should be
considered. In this study, we introduce ways to classify texts employing
concepts of complex networks, which may be able to capture syntactic, semantic
and even pragmatic features. The interplay between the various metrics of the
complex networks is analyzed with three applications, namely identification of
machine translation (MT) systems, evaluation of quality of machine translated
texts and authorship recognition. We shall show that topological features of
the networks representing texts can enhance the ability to identify MT systems
in particular cases. For evaluating the quality of MT texts, on the other hand,
high correlation was obtained with methods capable of capturing the semantics.
This was expected because the golden standards used are themselves based on
word co-occurrence. Notwithstanding, the Katz similarity, which involves
semantic and structure in the comparison of texts, achieved the highest
correlation with the NIST measurement, indicating that in some cases the
combination of both approaches can improve the ability to quantify quality in
MT. In authorship recognition, again the topological features were relevant in
some contexts, though for the books and authors analyzed good results were
obtained with semantic features as well. Because hybrid approaches encompassing
semantic and topological features have not been extensively used, we believe

general on the symmetric key cryptographic technique. We review two widely used

critical current density Jc, which is strongly reduced with applied magnetic
field, and attribute this to suppression of the superconductivity in the
\pi-band. The temperature dependence of the creep rate S(T) at low magnetic

high pinning energies at low field that are strongly suppressed by high field,

of matrices having one of these structures to inverting the matrices with the
structures of the three other types. Surprising power of this approach has been
demonstrated in a number of works, which culminated in ingeneous numerically
stable algorithms that approximated the solution of a nonsingular Toeplitz
linear system in nearly linear (versus previuosly cubic) arithmetic time. We
first revisit this powerful method, covering it comprehensively, and then
specialize it to yield a similar acceleration of the known algorithms for
computations with matrices having structures of Vandermonde or Cauchy types. In
particular we arrive at numerically stable approximate multipoint polynomial

  The workshop is devoted to model-based testing of both software and hardware.
Model-based testing uses models describing the required behavior of the system
under consideration to guide such efforts as test selection and test results
evaluation. Testing validates the real system behavior against models and
checks that the implementation conforms to them, but is capable also to find
errors in the models themselves.
  The first MBT workshop was held in 2004, in Barcelona. At that time MBT
already had become a hot topic, but the MBT workshop was the first event
devoted mostly to this domain. Since that time the area has generated enormous
scientific interest, and today there are several specialized workshops and more
broad conferences on software and hardware design and quality assurance
covering model based testing. MBT has become one of the most powerful system
analysis tools, one of the latest cutting-edge topics related is applying MBT
in security analysis and testing. MBT workshop tries to keep up with current

energy from the desired signal, noise, and interference. In particular, we
consider a power splitting receiver which dynamically splits the received power
into two power streams for information decoding and energy harvesting. We
design power allocation algorithms maximizing the spectral efficiency
(bit/s/Hz) of data transmission. In particular, the algorithm design is
formulated as a nonconvex optimization problem which takes into account the
constraint on the minimum power delivered to the receiver. The problem is
solved by using convex optimization techniques and a one-dimensional search.
The optimal power allocation algorithm serves as a system benchmark scheme due
to its high complexity. To strike a balance between system performance and
computational complexity, we also propose two suboptimal algorithms which
require a low computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the
excellent performance of the proposed suboptimal algorithms.

Scenarios of dark energy are distinguished by the cut-off of cosmic age,
conformal time, and event horizon. The best-fit value of matter density for the
three scenarios almost steadily located at $\Omega_{m0}=0.26$ by the joint
constraint. For the agegraphic models, they can be recovered to the standard
cosmological model when the constant $c$ which presents the fraction of dark
energy approaches to infinity. Absence of upper limit of $c$ by the joint

also reconstruct the current equation of state of dark energy at different
scenarios, respectively. Employing the model criteria
$\chi^2_{\textrm{min}}/dof$, we find that conformal time model is the worst,

constraints, we find that SEC is fulfilled at redshift $0.2 \lesssim z \lesssim

turbulence in 1941, the description of mechanism leading to the energy cascade

non-differentiability of the velocity field in the limit of vanishing

related to a finite-time singularity (blowup) of incompressible Euler
equations. However, the existence of such blowup is still an open problem too.
In this paper, we show that the blowup indeed represents the driving mechanism
of inertial range for a simplified (shell) model of turbulence. Here, blowups
generate coherent structures (instantons), which travel through the inertial
range in finite time and are described by universal self-similar statistics.
The anomaly (deviation of scaling exponents of velocity moments from the
Kolmogorov theory) is related analytically to the process of instanton creation
using the large deviation principle. The results are confirmed by numerical
simulations.

studied using density functional theory with the non-local correlation
functional vdW-DF. By comparing these systems we can systematically investigate
their adsorption nature and differences between the two functional versions
vdW-DF1 and vdW-DF2. The bigger size of the C60 molecule makes it bind stronger
to the surface than benzene, yet the interface between the molecules and the
sheets are similar in nature. The binding separation is more sensitive to the
exchange variant used in vdW-DF than to the correlation version. This result is
related to the exchange and correlation components of the potential energy
curve (PEC). We show that a moderate dipole forms for C60 on graphene, unlike
for the other adsorption systems. We find that the corrugation is very
sensitive to the variant or version of vdW-DF used, in particular the exchange.
Further, we show that this sensitivity arise indirectly through the shift in
binding separation caused by changing vdW-DF variant. Based on our results, we
suggest a concerted theory-experiment approach to assess the exchange and
correlation contributions to physisorption. Using DFT calculations, the
corrugation can be linked to the optimal separation, allowing us to extract the
exchange-correlation part of the adsorption energy. Molecules with same
interfaces to the surface, but different geometries, can in turn cast light on
the role of van der Waals forces.

change of the surface stiffness or of the surface energy modifies the migration

$\Lambda$ be the path algebra $K(\Gamma, \rho)$ and let $\mathscr{D}(\Lambda)$
be the dual extension of $\Lambda$. In this paper, we prove that each Lie
derivation of $\mathscr{D}(\Lambda)$ is of the standard form.

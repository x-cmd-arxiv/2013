number of stars observed in the Cygnus-Lyra region opening a new window for
asteroseismology. In order to accomplish one of the preconditions for the
asteroseismic modelling of the stars, we aim to derive fundamental parameters
and individual abundances for a sample of 18 Gamma Dor (GD)/Delta Sct (DSct)
and 8 SPB/beta Cep candidate stars in the Kepler satellite field of view. We
use the spectral synthesis method to model newly obtained, high-resolution
spectra of 26 stars in order to derive their fundamental parameters and
individual abundances. The stars are then placed into the log(Teff)-log(g)
diagram and the obtained spectroscopic classification is compared to the
existing photometric one. For hot stars, the KIC temperatures appear to be
systematically underestimated, in agreement with previous findings. We also
find that the temperatures derived from our spectra agree reasonably well with
those derived from the SED fitting. According to their position in the
log(Teff)-log(g) diagram, two stars are expected GD stars, four stars are
expected DSct stars, and four stars are possibly DSct stars at the blue edge of
the instability strip. Two stars are confirmed SPB variables, and one star
falls into the SPB instability region but its parameters might be biased by
binarity. Two of the four stars that fall into the DSct instability region show
GD-type oscillation in their light curves implying that GD-like oscillations
are much more common among the DSct stars than is theoretically expected.
Moreover, one of the stars located at the hot border of the DSct instability
strip is classified as DSct-GD hybrid pulsator from its light curve analysis.
Given that these findings are fully consistent with recent investigations, we
conclude that a revision of the GD and DSct instability strips is essential.

to determine the underlying reaction amplitudes unambiguously.
Pseudoscalar-meson photoproduction from the nucleon is characterized by four
such amplitudes and complete sets involve single- and double-polarization
observables.
  [Purpose] Identify complete sets of observables, and study how measurements
with finite error bars impact their potential to determine the reaction
amplitudes unambiguously.
  [Method] The authors provide arguments to employ the transversity
representation in order to determine the amplitudes in pseudoscalar-meson
photoproduction. It is studied whether the amplitudes in the transversity basis
for the $\gamma p \to K^+\Lambda$ reaction can be estimated without ambiguity.
To this end, data from the GRAAL collaboration and mock data from a realistic
model are analyzed.
  [Results] It is illustrated that the moduli of normalized transversity
amplitudes can be determined from precise single-polarization data. Starting
from mock data with achievable experimental resolution, it is quite likely to
obtain imaginary solutions for the relative phases of the amplitudes. Also the
real solutions face a discrete phase ambiguity which makes it impossible to
obtain a statistically significant solution for the relative phases at
realistic experimental conditions.
  [Conclusions] Single polarization observables are effective in determining
the moduli of the amplitudes in a transversity basis. Determining the relative
phases of the amplitudes from double-polarization observables is far less
evident. The availability of a complete set of observables does not allow one
to unambiguously determine the reaction amplitudes with statistical
significance.

contributes to the multi-scale study of the model iron-chromium alloy and their
free surfaces by numerical simulations. This study begins with ab initio
calculations of properties related to the mixture of atoms of iron and
chromium. We highlight complex dependency of the magnetic moments of the
chromium atoms on their local chemical environment. Surface properties are also
proving sensitive to magnetism. This is the case of impurity segregation of
chromium in iron and of their interactions near the surface. In a second step,
we construct a simple energy model for high numerical efficiency. It is based
on pair interactions on a rigid lattice to which are given local chemical
environment and temperature dependencies. With this model, we reproduce the ab
initio results at zero temperature and experimental results at high
temperature. We also deduce the solubility limits at all intermediate
temperatures with mean field approximations that we compare to Monte Carlo
simulations. The last step of our work is to introduce free surfaces in our
model. We then study the effect of ab initio calculated bulk and surface
properties on surface segregation. Finally, we calculate segregation isotherms.
We therefore propose an evolution model of surface composition of iron-chromium
alloys as a function of bulk composition.

electrostatic disorder, and the existence of additional subbands and only rely
on the topology of the nanowire and the existence of a superconducting gap.
Finally, we show that the coherence length in the nontrivial phase is much

  formulation towards high order","41 pages",,,,"math.NA physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Generalized Riemann Problems (GRP) for nonlinear hyperbolic systems of
balance laws in one space dimension are now well-known and can be formulated as
follows: Given initial-data which are smooth on two sides of a discontinuity,
determine the time evolution of the solution near the discontinuity. While the
classical Riemann problem serves as a primary building block in the
construction of many numerical schemes (most notably the Godunov scheme), the
analytic study of GRP will lead to an array of GRP schemes, which extend the
Godunov scheme. Currently there are extensive studies on the second-order GRP
scheme, which proves to be robust and is capable of resolving complex
multidimensional fluid dynamic problems [M. Ben-Artzi and J. Falcovitz,
""Generalized Riemann Problems in Computational Fluid Dynamics"", Cambridge
University Press, 2003]. A more general formulation of the second-order GRP
solver is still confined with a class of weakly coupled systems [Numer. Math.
(2007) 106:369-425]. This paper provides a unified approach for solving the GRP
in the general context of hyperbolic balance laws, without weakly coupled
constraint, towards high order accuracy. The derivation of the second-order GRP
solver is more concise compared to those in previous works and the third-order
quadratic GRP is resolved for the first time. The latter is shown to be
necessary through numerical experiments with strong discontinuities. Our method
relies heavily on the new treatment of the rarefaction wave by deriving the
L(Q)-equations, an ODE system capturing the ""evolution"" of the characteristic
derivatives in x-t space for generalized Riemann invariants. The case of a
sonic point is incorporated into a general treatment. The accuracy of the
derived GRP solvers are justified and numerical examples are presented for the
performance of the resulting scheme.

al. The HOD parameterization is based on low-luminosity AGN in cosmological
simulations. At the median redshift of z~1.2, we derive a median mass of
(1.02+0.21/-0.23)x10^{13} Msun/h for halos hosting central AGN and an upper
limit of ~10% on the AGN satellite fraction. Our modeling results indicate (at
the 2.5-sigma level) that X-ray AGN reside in more massive halos compared to
more bolometrically luminous, optically-selected quasars at similar redshift.
The modeling also yields constraints on the duty cycle of the X-ray AGN, and we
find that at z~1.2 the average duration of the X-ray AGN phase is two orders of
magnitude longer than that of the quasar phase. Our inferred mean occupation
function of X-ray AGN is similar to recent empirical measurements with a group
catalog and suggests that AGN halo occupancy increases with increasing halo
mass. We project the XMM-COSMOS 2PCF measurements to forecast the required
survey parameters needed in future AGN clustering studies to enable higher
precision HOD constraints and determinations of key physical parameters like
the satellite fraction and duty cycle. We find that N^{2}/A~5x10^{6} deg^{-2}
(with N the number of AGN in a survey area of A deg^{2}) is sufficient to
constrain the HOD parameters at the 10% level, which is easily achievable by
upcoming and proposed X-ray surveys.

wide range in amplitudes indicates rotationally modulated variability due to
magnetic phenomena and/or inhomogeneous cloud cover. Weak H-alpha emission
indicates some magnetic activity, but it is difficult to explain the observed
amplitudes by magnetic phenomena unless they are combined with cloud
inhomogeneities (which might have a magnetic cause). However, inhomogenous
cloudcover alone can explain all our observations, and our data align with
theory in requiring that the regions with the thickest clouds also have the
lowest effective temperature. Combined with published v sin(i) results, our
rotation period yields a 95% confidence lower limit of 0.111 solar radii on the

universality in their low temperature acoustic properties. This universality is
attributed to the attenuation of phonons by tunneling two-level systems (TLSs),
facilitated by the interaction of the TLSs with the phonon field. TLS-phonon
interaction also mediates effective TLS-TLS interactions, which dictates the
existence of a glassy phase and its low energy properties. Here we consider
KBr:CN, the archetypal disordered lattice showing universality. We calculate
numerically, using conjugate gradients method, the effective TLS-TLS
interactions for inversion symmetric (CN flips) and asymmetric (CN rotations)
TLSs, in the absence and presence of disorder, in two and three dimensions. The
observed dependence of the magnitude and spatial power law of the interaction
on TLS symmetry, and its change with disorder, characterizes TLS-TLS
interactions in disordered lattices in both extreme and moderate dilutions. Our
results are in good agreement with the two-TLS model, recently introduced to
explain long-standing questions regarding the quantitative universality of
phonon attenuation and the energy scale of $\approx 1-3$ K below which
universality is observed.

Galam Unifying Frame (GUF), set to investigate the dynamics of two-state
variable systems within the frame of opinion dynamics. When combined with
Metropolis dynamics, an unexpected intermediate ""dis/order"" phase is found with
the coexistence of two attractors associated respectively to an ordered and a
disordered phases. The basin of attraction of initial conditions for the
disordered phase attractor starts from zero size at a first critical
temperature $T_{c1}$ to embody the total landscape of initial conditions at a
second critical temperature $T_{c2}$ with $T_{c1}\approx 1.59$ and
$T_{c2}\approx 2.11$ in $J/k_B$ units. It appears that $T_{c2}$ is close to the
Onsager result $T_{c}\approx 2.27$. The transition, which is first-order like,
exhibits a vertical jump to the disorder phase at $T_{c2}$, reminiscent of the
rather abrupt vanishing of the corresponding Onsager second order transition.
However, using Glauber dynamics combined with GUF does not yield the
intermediate phase and instead the expected single transition at $T_{c}\approx
3.09$. Accordingly, although the ""dis/order"" phase produced by the GUF -
Metropolis combination is not physical, it is an intriguing result to be
understood. In particular the fact that Glauber and Metropolis dynamics yield
so different results using GUF needs an explanation. The possibility of
extending GUF to larger clusters is discussed.

debate. Proximity to an antiferromagnetic phase suggests that pairing is
mediated by spin fluctuations, but orbital fluctuations have also been invoked.
The former typically favour a pairing state of extended s-wave symmetry with a
gap that changes sign between electron and hole Fermi surfaces (s+-), while the
latter yield a standard s-wave state without sign change (s++). Here we show
that applying pressure to KFe2As2 induces a change of pairing state. The
critical temperature Tc decreases with pressure initially, and then suddenly
increases, above a critical pressure Pc. The constancy of the Hall coefficient
through Pc rules out a change in the Fermi surface. There is compelling
evidence that the pairing state below Pc is d-wave, from bulk measurements at
ambient pressure. Above Pc, the high sensitivity to disorder argues for a
particular kind of s+- state. The change from d-wave to s-wave is likely to
proceed via an unusual s + id state that breaks time-reversal symmetry. The
proximity of two distinct pairing states found here experimentally is natural
given the near degeneracy of d-wave and s+- states found theoretically. These
findings make a compelling case for spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity
in this key iron-arsenide material.

of nodes in networks. It has now been employed for more than a decade to
analyze very different types of networks in many scientific fields such as
Biology and social sciences. Because of conditional dependency, there is no
analytical expression for the posterior distribution over the latent variables,
given the data and model parameters. Therefore, approximation strategies, based
on variational techniques or sampling, have been proposed for clustering.
Moreover, two SBM model selection criteria exist for the estimation of the
number K of clusters in networks but, again, both of them rely on some
approximations. In this paper, we show how an analytical expression can be
derived for the integrated complete data log likelihood. We then propose an
inference algorithm to maximize this exact quantity. This strategy enables the
clustering of nodes as well as the estimation of the number clusters to be
performed at the same time and no model selection criterion has to be computed
for various values of K. The algorithm we propose has a better computational
cost than existing inference techniques for SBM and can be employed to analyze
large networks with ten thousand nodes. Using toy and true data sets, we
compare our work with other approaches.

the configurations have increasing order and crystallize as the temperature

introduce several realistic impurity models with non-local modifications of

destroyed by introducing small residual resistivity $\rho_0^{cr} = 5z^{-1} ~
10z^{-1} [\mu\Omega cm]$ ($z^{-1} = m^*/m$ being the mass-enhancement factor),
consistently with the previous theoretical study for the on-site impurity model

non-local impurity models with realistic parameters. We also discuss the effect
of the impurity-induced non-local orbital order on the superconducting state.

the phase transition is smoother than in the homogeneous case, whatever the
critical exponent of the homogeneous model is: disorder is therefore always
relevant. We illustrate these results with the example of an environment based
on the sign of a Gaussian correlated sequence, in which we show that the phase
transition is of infinite order in presence of strong disorder. Our results

Zeeman couplings, the associated two-dimensional problem for the odd parity
topological superconducting state maps onto {\em two} copies of generalized

fermions. In contrast, there are no zero energy states for the topologically
trivial $s$-wave superconductor in the presence of any chiral symmetry breaking
perturbation in the particle-hole channel, such as regular Dirac mass. We show
that the number of one-dimensional dispersive modes along the vortex line is

composite stellar populations with a burst model, allowing both components to
be reddened by dust, in order to match the data in five different redshift

within five redshift bins, thus defining our new SED template set for
photometric redshift estimates. The results we get with the new template set

unbiased, with a scatter of \sigma(\Delta z)=0.027 (including outliers), and a
fraction of catastrophic outliers (|z_phot-z_spec|/(1+z_spec)>0.15) of 0.12%.

a rotating platform which allows modulating the signal of interest and
retrieving it without bias after post-processing. Using this principle, a

13CO, C18O, and N2H+ line observations obtained with the IRAM 30m telescope.
Correlating our velocity dispersion measurements with the filament column
densities derived from Herschel data, we show that interstellar filaments can
be divided into two regimes: thermally subcritical filaments, which have
transonic velocity dispersions (c_s ~< \sigma_tot < 2 c_s) independent of
column density, and are gravitationally unbound; and thermally supercritical
filaments, which have higher velocity dispersions scaling roughly as the square
root of column density (\sigma_tot ~ \Sigma^0.5), and are self-gravitating. The
higher velocity dispersions of supercritical filaments may not directly arise
from supersonic interstellar turbulence but may be driven by gravitational
contraction/accretion. Based on our observational results, we propose an
evolutionary scenario whereby supercritical filaments undergo gravitational
contraction and increase in mass per unit length through accretion of
background material while remaining in rough virial balance. We further suggest
that this accretion process allows supercritical filaments to keep their
approximately constant inner widths (~ 0.1 pc) while contracting.

the stellar interiors, for understanding the chemical evolution of the Galaxy
and the Big Bang nucleosynthesis. The study of Li in stars of open clusters
(hereafter OC) allows a detailed comparison with stellar evolutionary models
and permits us to trace its galactic evolution. The OC NGC 2243 is particularly
interesting because of its low metallicity ([Fe/H]=$-0.54 \pm0.10$ dex). We
measure the iron and lithium abundance in stars of the metal-poor OC NGC 2243.
The first aim is to determine whether the Li dip extends to such low
metallicities, the second is to compare the results of our Li analysis in this
OC with those present in 47 Tuc, a globular cluster of similar metallicity. We
performed a detailed analysis of high-resolution spectra obtained with the
multi-object facility FLAMES at the ESO VLT 8.2m telescope. Lithium abundance
was derived through line equivalent widths and the OSMARCS atmosphere models.
We determine a Li dip center of 1.06 $M_\odot$, which is much smaller than that
observed in solar metallicity and metal-rich clusters. This finding confirms
and strengthens the conclusion that the mass of the stars in the Li dip
strongly depends on stellar metallicity. The mean Li abundance of the cluster
is $\log n{\rm (Li)}=2.70$ dex, which is substantially higher than that
observed in 47 Tuc. We estimated an iron abundance of [Fe/H]=$-0.54 \pm0.10$
dex for NGC 2243, which is similar (within the errors) to previous findings.
The [$ \alpha$/Fe] content ranges from $0.00\pm0.14$ for Ca to $0.20\pm0.22$
for Ti, which is low when compared to thick disk stars and to Pop II stars, but
compatible with thin disk objects. We found a mean radial velocity of 61.9
$\pm$ 0.8 \kms for the cluster.

further elastic deformation is negligible owing to the limited increase in the

noise induced switching between small and large amplitude oscillations that
persists for large system sizes (N), and deep into the non oscillatory part of

passage times between the two oscillating states. From our scaling function, we
show that the first passage times have a well defined form in the large N

careful treatment of the noise will lead to a set of non-trivial deterministic

in the sense that the optimal jamming strategy is to effectively force both
transmitter and receiver to default to linear mappings, i.e., the jammer
ensures, whenever possible, that the transmitter and receiver cannot benefit
from non-linear strategies. This result is shown to subsume the known result
for Gaussian source and channel. We analyze conditions and general settings
where such unbeatable strategy can indeed be achieved by the jammer. Moreover,
we provide the procedure to approximate optimal jamming in the remaining

redshift dependent escape fractions of ionizing radiation on the ability of
forthcoming experiments to constrain galaxy formation via the redshifted 21cm
power spectrum. We use a model for reionization which combines the hierarchical
galaxy formation model GALFORM implemented within the Millennium-II dark matter
simulation, with a semi-numerical scheme to describe the resulting ionization
structure. Using this model we show that the structure and distribution of
ionised regions at fixed neutral fraction, and hence the slope and amplitude of
the 21 cm power spectrum, is dependent on the variation of ionising photon
escape fraction with galaxy mass and redshift. However, we find that the
influence of the unknown escape fraction and its evolution is smaller than the
dominant astrophysical effect provided by SNe feedback strength in high
redshift galaxies. The unknown escape fraction of ionizing radiation from
galaxies is therefore unlikely to prevent measurement of the properties of high
redshift star formation using observations of the 21cm power spectrum.

framework for studying these networks, and the time-varying landscape

  We have developed an algorithm that can exhaustively enumerate the
microstates of a molecular network of small copy numbers under the finite
buffer condition that the net gain in newly synthesized molecules is smaller

exact mean or steady state landscape probability distribution over microstates.
We show how the full landscape probability for the gene networks of the

  Our algorithm works for networks of small copy numbers buffered with a finite
copy number of net molecules that can be synthesized, regardless of the
reaction stoichiometry, and is optimal in both storage and time complexity. The
buffer size is limited by the available memory or disk storage. Our algorithm
is applicable to a class of biological networks when the copy numbers of

formalism allows for the standard jet shape analysis while simultaneously
providing sensitivity to soft radiation at wide angles from the jet. We use a
factorization framework for cross-sections differential in $\tau_1$ and the
transverse momentum (P_{J_T}) and rapidity (y) of the jet, in the region

We utilize data from long-term, simultaneous GeV-TeV observations by the Fermi
Large Area Telescope and the ARGO-YBJ experiment extending over 850 days. For
an assumed value of B, we evaluate the daily GeV pair-echo flux expected from
the TeV data, select the dates where this exceeds the Fermi 2-\sigma
sensitivity, compute the probability that this flux is excluded by the Fermi
data for each date, and then combine the probabilities using the inverse normal
method. Consequently, we exclude B < 10^{-20.5} G for a field coherence length
of 1 kpc at 4- \sigma level, as long as plasma instabilities are unimportant
for cooling of the pair beam. This is much more significant than the 2-\sigma
bounds we obtained previously from observations of Mrk 501, by virtue of more
extensive data from the ARGO-YBJ, as well as improved statistical analysis.
Compared with most other studies of IGMF bounds, the evidence we present here

simple sphere-tip compression system, the local radial mechanical properties of
DNA are systematically studied by changing the tip size. The compression
simulation results for the 16 nm diameter sphere tip are well consistent with
the experimental results. With the diameter of the tip decreasing, the radial
compressive elastic properties under external loads become sensitive to the tip
size and the local DNA conformation. There appears a suddenly force break in
the compression-force curve when the sphere size is less than or equal to 12 nm
diameter. The analysis of the hydrogen bonds and base stacking interaction
shows there is a local unwinding process occurs. During the local unwinding
process, first the hydrogen bonds between complement base pairs are broken.
With the compression aggregating, the local backbones in the compression center
are unwound from the double helix conformation to a kind of parallel
conformation. This local unwinding behavior deducing by external loads is

- f(w)| \le \epsilon$. But in general, we will not know whether $f$ is
Lipschitz, much less know its Lipschitz constant. Assume optimistically that
$f$ is Lipschitz-continuous with the smallest constant consistent with the $n$
data. We find the maximum (over such regular $f$) of $|\hat{f}(w) - f(w)|$ for
the best possible emulator $\hat{f}$; we call this the ""mini-minimax
uncertainty"" at $w$. In reality, $f$ might not be Lipschitz or---if it is---it
might not attain its Lipschitz constant on the data. Hence, the mini-minimax
uncertainty at $w$ could be much smaller than $|\hat{f}(w) - f(w)|$. But if the
mini-minimax uncertainty is large, then---even if $f$ satisfies the optimistic
regularity assumption---$|\hat{f}(w) - f(w)|$ could be large, no matter how
cleverly we choose $\hat{f}$. For the Community Atmosphere Model, the maximum
(over $w$) of the mini-minimax uncertainty based on a set of 1154~observations
of $f$ is no smaller than it would be for a single observation of $f$ at the
centroid of the 21-dimensional parameter space. We also find lower confidence
bounds for quantiles of the mini-minimax uncertainty and its mean over the
domain of $f$. For the Community Atmosphere Model, these lower confidence
bounds are an appreciable fraction of the maximum.

reversible free energy surfaces of several different atomistic models are

we show that there is one stable or metastable liquid phase, and there is an
ice-like crystal phase. The time scales for crystallization in these systems
far exceed those of structural relaxation in the supercooled metastable liquid.
We show how this wide separation in time scales produces an illusion of a
low-temperature liquid-liquid transition. The phenomenon suggesting
metastability of two distinct liquid phases is actually coarsening of the
ordered ice-like phase, which we elucidate using both analytical theory and
computer simulation. For the latter, we describe robust methods for computing
reversible free energy surfaces, and we consider effects of electrostatic
boundary conditions. We show that sensible alterations of models and boundary
conditions produce no qualitative changes in low-temperature phase behaviors of
these systems, only marginal changes in equations of state. On the other hand,
we show that altering sampling time scales can produce large and qualitative
nonequilibrium effects. Recent reports of evidence of a liquid-liquid critical

meshless methods that has been used very successfully to solve several types of
boundary value problems since the late nineties. In this paper, using a
generalized moving least squares (GMLS) approximation, a new direct MLPG
technique, called DMLPG, is presented. Following the principle of meshless
methods to express everything ""entirely in terms of nodes"", the generalized MLS
recovers test functionals directly from values at nodes, without any detour via
shape functions. This leads to a cheaper and even more accurate scheme. In
particular, the complete absence of shape functions allows numerical
integrations in the weak forms of the problem to be done over low{degree
polynomials instead of complicated shape functions. Hence, the standard MLS
shape function subroutines are not called at all. Numerical examples illustrate
the superiority of the new technique over the classical MLPG. On the
theoretical side, this paper discusses stability and convergence for the new
discretizations that replace those of the standard MLPG. However, it does not
treat stability, convergence, or error estimation for the MLPG as a whole. This
should be taken from the literature on MLPG.

system concerns the observed population ratio between the Oort Cloud (OC) and
the Scattered Disc (SD): observations suggest that this ratio lies between 100
and 1000 but simulations that produce these two reservoirs simultaneously
consistently yield a value of the order of 10. Here we stress that the
populations in the OC and SD are inferred from the observed fluxes of new Long
Period Comets (LPCs) and Jupiter-family comets (JFCs), brighter than some
reference total magnitude. However, the population ratio estimated in the
simulations of formation of the SD and OC refers to objects bigger than a given
size. There are multiple indications that LPCs are intrinsically brighter than
JFCs, i.e. an LPC is smaller than a JFC with the same total absolute magnitude.
When taking this into account we revise the SD/JFC population ratio from our
simulations relative to Duncan and Levison (1997), and then deduce from the
observations that the size-limited population ratio between the OC and the SD
is 44 (-34)(+54). From simulations we obtain 12 +- 1 but the agreement cannot
be rejected by the null hypothesis.

source of such bursts is compact binary mergers in globular clusters. This link
between globular clusters and GRBs offers the possibility to find time
intervals in the past with higher probabilities of a nearby burst, by tracing
globular cluster orbits back in time. Here we show that the expected flux from
such bursts is not flat over the past 550 Myr but rather exhibits three broad
peaks, at 70, 180 and 340 Myr ago. The main source for nearby GRBs for all
three time intervals is the globular cluster 47 Tuc, a consequence of its large
mass and high stellar encounter rate, as well as the fact that it is one of the
globular clusters which comes quite close to the Sun. Mass extinction events
indeed coincide with all three time intervals found in this study, although a
chance coincidence is quite likely. Nevertheless, the identified time intervals
can be used as a guide to search for specific signatures of GRBs in the
geological record around these times.

sciences in the observe-predict-control-design knowledge ladder. Compared to
the engineering or physics problems, dynamical models in quantitative biology
typically dependent on a relatively large number of parameters. Therefore, the
relationship between model parameters and dynamics is often prohibitively
difficult to determine. We developed a method to depict the input-output
relationship for multi-parametric stochastic and deterministic models via
information-theoretic quantification of similarity between model parameters and
modules. Identification of most information-theoretically orthogonal biological
components, provided mathematical language to precisely communicate and
visualise compensation like phenomena such as biological robustness, sloppiness
and statistical non-identifiability. A comprehensive analysis of the
multi-parameter NF-$\kappa$B signalling pathway demonstrates that the
information-theoretic similarity reflects a topological structure of the
network. Examination of the currently available experimental data on this
system reveals the number of identifiable parameters and suggests informative
experimental protocols.

physical-layer abstraction tools for predicting the link performance. We will
show that, in both cases, it is possible to increase the average spectral

addition to the well-known anomaly associated to reentrant melting, the

for estimation of the regression function over a H\""older ball with smoothness
index $\beta$ is $n^{-\beta/(2\beta+1)}$ if $1\leq p<\infty$ and $(n/\log
n)^{-\beta/(2\beta+1)}$ if $p=\infty.$ There are many known procedures that
either attain this rate for $p=\infty$ but are suboptimal by a $\log n$ factor
in the case $p<\infty$ or the other way around. In this article, we construct
an estimator that simultaneously achieves the optimal rates under $L^p$-risk
for all $1\leq p\leq \infty$ without prior knowledge of $\beta.$ In contrast to
classical wavelet thresholding methods that kill small empirical wavelet
coefficients and keep large ones, it is essential for simultaneous adaptation
that on each resolution level, the largest empirical wavelet coefficients are
truncated. This leads to a completely different point of view on wavelet
thresholding. The crucial part in the construction of the estimator is the size
of the truncation level which is linked to the unknown smoothness index.
Although estimation of the smoothness index is known to be a difficult task,
there is a data-driven choice of the truncation level that is sufficiently
precise for our purpose.

Plebanski-Demianski (PD) solution of Einstein-Maxwell theory with a negative
cosmological constant admits Killing spinors. We consider in detail two
different scaling limits of the PD metric. The first of these limits removes
the acceleration parameter, and leads to the Carter-Plebanski solution. In this
case, the integrability conditions for Killing spinors were obtained by
Alonso-Alberca, Meessen and Ortin in hep-th/0003071, and we show that these are
not only necessary, but also sufficient for the existence of Killing spinors.
This fills also a gap in hep-th/9808097, where the integrability conditions for
supersymmetry of the Kerr-Newman-AdS black hole were worked out, but the
Killing spinor was not constructed explicitely. The second scaling limit
eliminates the rotation parameter, and leads to the cosmological C-metric,
which describes accelerated black holes in AdS. Also in this case, the
supersymmetry conditions are obtained, and it is shown that they follow from
the ones of the general PD solution by scaling the parameters appropriately. In
all cases, we determine the three-dimensional base space that appears in the
classification scheme of hep-th/0307022, and prove that for the
1/2-supersymmetric Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS spacetime, this base is unique. A
Wick-rotation of our results leads to gravitational instantons that generalize
the ones constructed recently by Martelli, Passias and Sparks in arXiv:12124618
to U(1)xU(1) symmetry. These instantons are shown to admit an integrable almost
complex structure. Finally, our work may open the possibility to systematically
construct generalizations of the PD metric that include scalar fields with a
potential in matter-coupled gauged supergravity.

further strengthened, a cosmology beyond the standard model may prove
necessary.

high dimensional problems. However, when applied to the sparse modeling method
Lasso, CV leads to models that are unstable in high-dimensions, and
consequently not suited for reliable interpretation. In this paper, we propose
a model-free criterion ESCV based on a new estimation stability (ES) metric and
CV. Our proposed ESCV finds a locally ES-optimal model smaller than the CV
choice so that the it fits the data and also enjoys estimation stability

similar easily parallelizable computational cost. In particular, we compare the
two approaches with respect to several performance measures when applied to the
Lasso on both simulated and real data sets. For dependent predictors common in
practice, our main finding is that, ESCV cuts down false positive rates often
by a large margin, while sacrificing little of true positive rates. ESCV
usually outperforms CV in terms of parameter estimation while giving similar
performance as CV in terms of prediction. For the two real data sets from
neuroscience and cell biology, the models found by ESCV are less than half of

plausible than those by CV as well. We also discuss some regularization

identified as a soft gamma-ray source with the IBIS instrument of the INTEGRAL
satellite, coincident with a quasar at high redshift (z=3.12). Aims. We studied
the radio structure of IGR J12319-0749 to strengthen its blazar identification
by detecting a compact radio jet on the milli-arcsecond (mas) angular scale,
and to measure its astrometric position accurate to mas level. Methods. We used

Results. IGR J12319-0749 (J1231-0747) is a compact radio source, practically
unresolved on interferometric baselines up to ~136 million wavelengths. The
estimated brightness temperature (at least ~2 x 10^12 K) indicates that the
radio emission of its jet is Doppler-boosted. The accurate position of the
compact radio source is consistent with the positions measured at higher

  Performance",,,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  ROC is usually used to analyze the performance of classifiers in data mining.
ROC convex hull (ROCCH) is the least convex major-ant (LCM) of the empirical
ROC curve, and covers potential optima for the given set of classifiers.
Generally, ROC performance maximization could be considered to maximize the
ROCCH, which also means to maximize the true positive rate (tpr) and minimize
the false positive rate (fpr) for each classifier in the ROC space. However,
tpr and fpr are conflicting with each other in the ROCCH optimization process.
Though ROCCH maximization problem seems like a multi-objective optimization
problem (MOP), the special characters make it different from traditional MOP.
In this work, we will discuss the difference between them and propose convex
hull-based multi-objective genetic programming (CH-MOGP) to solve ROCCH
maximization problems. Convex hull-based sort is an indicator based selection
scheme that aims to maximize the area under convex hull, which serves as a
unary indicator for the performance of a set of points. A selection procedure
is described that can be efficiently implemented and follows similar design
principles than classical hyper-volume based optimization algorithms. It is
hypothesized that by using a tailored indicator-based selection scheme CH-MOGP
gets more efficient for ROC convex hull approximation than algorithms which
compute all Pareto optimal points. To test our hypothesis we compare the new
CH-MOGP to MOGP with classical selection schemes, including NSGA-II, MOEA/D)
and SMS-EMOA. Meanwhile, CH-MOGP is also compared with traditional machine
learning algorithms such as C4.5, Naive Bayes and Prie. Experimental results
based on 22 well-known UCI data sets show that CH-MOGP outperforms
significantly traditional EMOAs.

sought-after goal with important applications ranging from free-space
communication to nano-surgery. The underlying challenge is to control the
optical wavefront with a large number of degrees-of-freedom (DOF) at timescales
shorter than the medium dynamics. Recently, many advancements have been
reported following the demonstration of focusing through turbid samples by
wavefront-shaping, using spatial light modulators (SLMs) having >1000 DOF.
Unfortunately, SLM-based wavefront-shaping requires feedback from a
detector/camera and is limited to slowly-varying samples. Here, we demonstrate
a novel approach for wavefront-shaping using all-optical feedback. We show that
the complex wavefront required to focus through highly scattering samples,
including thin biological tissues, can be generated at sub-microsecond
timescales by the process of field self-organization inside a multimode laser
cavity, without requiring electronic feedback or SLMs. This wavefront-shaping
mechanism is more than five orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art,
reaching the timescales required in many applications.

which an unknown physical body is probed with electric currents applied on the

measured boundary voltage data. The reconstruction task is a nonlinear and
ill-posed inverse problem, whose solution calls for special regularized
algorithms, such as D-bar methods which are based on complex geometrical optics

lungs of unconscious intensive care patients or locating the focus of an

impractical, restricting the boundary area available for EIT measurements. An
extension of the D-bar method to the case when data is collected only on a

based on solving a boundary integral equation for the traces of the CGOs using
localized basis functions (Haar wavelets). The numerical evidence suggests that
the D-bar method can be applied to partial-boundary data in dimension two and
that the traces of the partial data CGOs approximate the full data CGO
solutions on the available portion of the boundary, for the necessary small $k$

domain knowledge, but also solving the exploration-exploitation dilemma in a
natural way. As Bayesian RL is intractable except for special cases, previous
work has proposed several approximation methods. However, these methods are
usually too sensitive to parameter values, and finding an acceptable parameter
setting is practically impossible in many applications. In this paper, we
propose a new algorithm that greedily approximates Bayesian RL to achieve
robustness in parameter space. We show that for a desired learning behavior,
our proposed algorithm has a polynomial sample complexity that is lower than
those of existing algorithms. We also demonstrate that the proposed algorithm
naturally outperforms other existing algorithms when the prior distributions
are not significantly misleading. On the other hand, the proposed algorithm
cannot handle greatly misspecified priors as well as the other algorithms can.
This is a natural consequence of the fact that the proposed algorithm is
greedier than the other algorithms. Accordingly, we discuss a way to select an
appropriate algorithm for different tasks based on the algorithms' greediness.
We also introduce a new way of simplifying Bayesian planning, based on which
future work would be able to derive new algorithms.

snippet that potentially supports a candidate entity, and aggregating scores
from different snippets into an entity score. Proximity scoring has been
studied in IR outside the scope of entity search. However, aggregation has been
hardwired except in a few cases where probabilistic language models are used.
We instead explore simple, robust, discriminative ranking algorithms, with
informative snippet features and broad families of aggregation functions. Our
first contribution is a study of proximity-cognizant snippet features. In
contrast with prior work which uses hardwired ""proximity kernels"" that
implement a fixed decay with distance, we present a ""universal"" feature
encoding which jointly expresses the perplexity (informativeness) of a query
term match and the proximity of the match to the entity mention. Our second
contribution is a study of aggregation functions. Rather than train the ranking
algorithm on snippets and then aggregate scores, we directly train on entities
such that the ranking algorithm takes into account the aggregation function
being used. Our third contribution is an extensive Web-scale evaluation of the
above algorithms on two data sets having quite different properties and
behavior. The first one is the W3C dataset used in TREC-scale enterprise

  The answer to this question implies that, within full categorical models of

categorical property known as self-similarity. We investigate the category
theory behind this, with explicit reference to typed systems, and their
monoidal closed structure. We then demonstrate close connections between such
self-similar structures and dagger Frobenius algebras. In particular, we
demonstrate that the categorical structures implied by the polymorphically
typed connectives give rise to a (lax unitless) form of the special forms of
Frobenius algebras known as classical structures, used heavily in abstract
categorical approaches to quantum mechanics.

shown that it is possible to write efficient and scalable tile algorithms for
performing a Cholesky factorization, a (pseudo) LU factorization, and a QR
factorization. The goal of this thesis is to study tiled algorithms in a
multi/many-core setting and to provide new algorithms which exploit the current
architecture to improve performance relative to current state-of-the-art
libraries while maintaining the stability and robustness of these libraries.

applied only to local Rindler horizons. But at least some parts of that
construction can usefully be extended to give meaningful results for arbitrary
bifurcate null surfaces. As presaged in Jacobson's original article, this more
general construction sharply brings into focus the questions: Is entropy
objectively ""real""? Or is entropy in some sense subjective and
observer-dependent?
  These innocent questions open a Pandora's box of often inconclusive debate. A
consensus opinion, though certainly not universally held, seems to be that
Clausius entropy (thermodynamic entropy, defined via a Clausius relation dS =
dQ/T) should be objectively real, but that the ontological status of
statistical entropy (Shannon or von Neumann entropy) is much more ambiguous,
and much more likely to be observer-dependent. This question is particularly
pressing when it comes to understanding Bekenstein entropy (black hole
entropy). To perhaps further add to the confusion, we shall argue that even the
Clausius entropy can often be observer-dependent. In the current article we
shall conclusively demonstrate that one can meaningfully assign a notion of
Clausius entropy to arbitrary bifurcate null surfaces --- effectively defining
a ""virtual Clausius entropy"" for arbitrary ""virtual (local) causal horizons"".
  As an application, we see that we can implement a version of the generalized
second law (GSL) for this virtual Clausius entropy. This version of GSL can be
related to certain (nonstandard) integral variants of the null energy condition
(NEC). Because the concepts involved are rather subtle, we take some effort in
being careful and explicit in developing our framework. In future work we will
apply this construction to generalize Jacobson's derivation of the Einstein
equations.

operate large clouds, usually based on systems such as Hadoop that support the

impacts. This paper investigates energy efficiency of two-tier femtocell
networks through combining game theory and stochastic learning. With the
Stackelberg game formulation, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework
is applied for studying the joint expected utility maximization of macrocells
and femtocells subject to the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio
requirements. In the learning procedure, the macrocells act as leaders and the
femtocells are followers. At each time step, the leaders commit to dynamic
strategies based on the best responses of the followers, while the followers
compete against each other with no further information but the leaders'
transmission parameters. In this paper, we propose two reinforcement learning
based intelligent algorithms to schedule each cell's stochastic power levels.
Numerical experiments are presented to validate the investigations. The results
show that the two learning algorithms substantially improve the energy

uncertainty. This article studies the structural properties of a probabilistic
model in an influence diagram. In particular, structural controllability
theorems and structural observability theorems are developed and algorithms are
formulated. Controllability and observability are fundamental concepts in
dynamic systems (Luenberger 1979). Controllability corresponds to the ability
to control a system while observability analyzes the inferability of its
variables. Both properties can be determined by the ranks of the system
matrices. Structural controllability and observability, on the other hand,
analyze the property of a system with its structure only, without the specific
knowledge of the values of its elements (tin 1974, Shields and Pearson 1976).
The structural analysis explores the connection between the structure of a
model and the functional dependence among its elements. It is useful in
comprehending problem and formulating solution by challenging the underlying

knowledge-based systems that flexibly and adaptively support their human users

analysis, a problem-solving approach is presented which can overcome many of
the limitations of traditional expert-systems. This approach implements an
explicit model of the human user's problem-solving capabilities as an integral
element in the overall problem solving architecture. This integrated model,
represented as an influence diagram, is the basis for achieving adaptive task
sharing behavior between the associate system and the human user. This
associate system model has been applied toward ongoing research on a Mars Rover
Manager's Associate (MRMA). MRMA's role would be to manage a small fleet of
robotic rovers on the Martian surface. The paper describes results for a

model-based temporal diagnosis. Since in most real world cases knowledge about
the temporal evolution of the system to be diagnosed is uncertain, we consider
the case when probabilistic temporal knowledge is available for each component
of the system and we choose to model it by means of Markov chains. In fact, we
aim at exploiting the statistical assumptions underlying reliability theory in

exploit Markov chain theory in order to discard, in the diagnostic process,
very unlikely diagnoses.

constraint satisfaction problems (CSP). A CSP is typically defined as the
problem of finding any consistent labeling for a fixed set of variables
satisfying all given constraints between these variables. However, for many
real tasks such as job-shop scheduling, time-table scheduling, design?, all
these constraints have not the same significance and have not to be necessarily
satisfied. A first distinction can be made between hard constraints, which
every solution should satisfy and soft constraints, whose satisfaction has not
to be certain. In this paper, we formalize the notion of possibilistic
constraint satisfaction problems that allows the modeling of uncertainly
satisfied constraints. We use a possibility distribution over labelings to
represent respective possibilities of each labeling. Necessity-valued
constraints allow a simple expression of the respective certainty degrees of
each constraint. The main advantage of our approach is its integration in the
CSP technical framework. Most classical techniques, such as Backtracking (BT),
arcconsistency enforcing (AC) or Forward Checking have been extended to handle
possibilistics CSP and are effectively implemented. The utility of our approach
is demonstrated on a simple design problem.

often unconvincing. The present paper explores another rationale for
probability models. ?Qualitative probability,' which is known to provide
stringent constraints on belief representation schemes, is derived from five
simple assumptions about relationships among beliefs. While counterparts of
familiar rationality concepts such as transitivity, dominance, and consistency

When the underlying graph is not triangulated, one has to first triangulated it

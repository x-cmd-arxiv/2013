An optimum hole-doping value was obtained with reasonable thermopower and
thermoelectric figure of merit being calculated. Here, a large increase in the
thermoelectric performance through lattice strain and the corresponding atomic
relaxations is predicted. This increase would be experimentally attainable via
growth in thin films of the material on top of different substrates. A small
tensile strain would produce large thermoelectric figures of merit at high
temperatures, $zT$ $\sim$ 1 in the range of oxygen excess $\delta$ $\sim$ 0.05

linear polarization, as well as changes in Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA)
images at 7mm with ~0.15 milliarcsecond resolution. The association of the
events at different wavebands is confirmed at high statistical significance by
probability arguments and Monte-Carlo simulations. A series of sharp peaks in
optical linear polarization, as well as a pronounced maximum in the 7mm
polarization of a superluminal jet knot, indicate rapid fluctuations in the
degree of ordering of the magnetic field. These results lead us to conclude
that the outburst occurred in the jet both in the quasi-stationary core and in
the superluminal knot, both at >12 parsecs downstream of the supermassive black
hole. We interpret the outburst as a consequence of the propagation of a
disturbance, elongated along the line of sight by light-travel time delays,
that passes through a standing recollimation shock in the core and propagates
down the jet to create the superluminal knot. The multi-wavelength light curves
vary together on long time-scales (months/years), but the correspondence is
poorer on shorter time-scales. This, as well as the variability of the
polarization and the dual location of the outburst, agrees with the
expectations of a multi-zone emission model in which turbulence plays a major
role in modulating the synchrotron and inverse Compton fluxes.

hospitals and residents. Each agent wishes to be matched to an agent in the
other set and has a strict preference over these potential matches. A matching
is stable if there are no blocking pairs, i.e., no pair of agents that prefer
each other to their assigned matches. Such a situation is undesirable as it
could lead to a deviation in which the blocking pair form a private arrangement
outside the matching. This however assumes that the blocking pair have social
ties or communication channels to facilitate the deviation. Relaxing the
stability definition to take account of the potential lack of social ties
between agents can yield larger stable matchings.
  In this paper, we define the Hospitals/Residents problem under Social
Stability (HRSS) which takes into account social ties between agents by
introducing a social network graph to the HR problem. Edges in the social
network graph correspond to resident-hospital pairs in the HR instance that
know one another. Pairs that do not have corresponding edges in the social
network graph can belong to a matching M but they can never block M. Relative
to a relaxed stability definition for HRSS, called social stability, we show
that socially stable matchings can have different sizes and the problem of
finding a maximum socially stable matching is NP-hard, though approximable
within 3/2. Furthermore we give polynomial time algorithms for three special
cases of the problem.

Here we describe the mapping observations in the NH3(1,1) and (2,2) inversion
lines of the first 49 sources performed with the Effelsberg 100-m telescope.
Results. The NH3(1,1) and (2,2) emission lines are detected in 12 and 7
sources, respectively. Among the newly discovered NH3 sources, our sample
includes the following well-known clouds: the starless core L694-2, the Serpens
cloud Cluster B, the Serpens dark cloud L572, the filamentary dark cloud L673,
the isolated protostellar source B335, and the complex star-forming region
Serpens South. Angular sizes between 40"" and 80"" (~0.04-0.08 pc) are observed
for compact starless cores but as large as 9' (~0.5 pc) for filamentary dark
clouds. The measured kinetic temperatures of the clouds lie between 9K and 18K.
From NH3 excitation temperatures of 3-8K we determine H2 densities with typical
values of ~(0.4-4) 10^4 cm^-3. The masses of the mapped cores range between
~0.05 and ~0.5M_solar. The relative ammonia abundance, X= [NH3]/[H2], varies
from 10^-7 to 5 10^-7 with the mean <X> = (2.7+/-0.6) 10^-7 (estimated from
spatially resolved cores assuming the filling factor eta = 1). In two clouds,
we observe kinematically split NH3 profiles separated by ~1 km/s. The splitting
is most likely due to bipolar molecular outflows for one of which we determine
an acceleration of <~ 0.03 km/s/yr. A starless core with significant rotational
energy is found to have a higher kinetic temperature than the other ones which
is probably caused by magnetic energy dissipation.

the disorder are long-ranged, i.e. power-law decaying. To some extent the
power-law exponents play the role of spatial dimension in a short-range model,
which allows us to probe the theoretically predicted existence of a nontrivial
critical value separating a region where dimensional reduction holds from one
where it is broken, while still considering the physical dimension d=3. By
extending our recently developed approach based on a nonperturbative functional
renormalization group combined with a supersymmetric formalism, we find that
such a critical value indeed exists, provided one chooses a specific relation
between the decay exponents of the interactions and of the disorder
correlations. This transition from dimensional reduction to its breakdown
should therefore be observable in simulations and numerical analyses, if not

amino acids. Hence, the search of recurrent spatial motifs is formulated as a
process of frequent subgraph discovery where each subgraph represents a spatial
motif. In this scope, several efficient approaches for frequent subgraph
discovery have been proposed in the literature. However, the set of discovered
frequent subgraphs is too large to be efficiently analyzed and explored in any
further process. In this paper, we propose a novel pattern selection approach
that shrinks the large number of discovered frequent subgraphs by selecting the
representative ones. Existing pattern selection approaches do not exploit the
domain knowledge. Yet, in our approach we incorporate the evolutionary

mass profiles of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. It is typically measured
using the ratio of the radial-to-tangential velocity dispersions at a given
distance from the halo centre. However, this measure is insufficient to
describe the dynamics of realistic haloes, which are typically quite elongated.
Studying the velocity distribution in massive DM haloes in cosmological
simulations, we find that in the inner parts of the haloes the local velocity
ellipsoids are strongly aligned with the major axis of the halo, the alignment
being stronger for more relaxed haloes. In the outer regions of the haloes, the
alignment becomes gradually weaker and the orientation is more random. These
two distinct regions of different degree of the alignment coincide with two
characteristic regimes of the DM density profile: shallower and steeper than
\rho r^{-2}. This alignment of the local velocity ellipsoids requires
reinterpretation of features found in measurements based on the spherically
averaged ratio of the radial-to-tangential velocity dispersions. In particular,
we show that the velocity distribution in the central halo regions is highly
anisotropic. For cluster-size haloes with mass 10^{14}-10^{15} h^-1 Msun, the
velocity anisotropy along the major axis is nearly independent of radius and is
equal to \beta=1-\sigma^2_{perp}/\sigma^2_{radial}=0.4, which is significantly
larger than the previously estimated spherically averaged velocity anisotropy.
The alignment of density and velocity anisotropies, and the radial trends may
also have some implications for the mass modelling based on kinematical data of
such objects as galaxy clusters or dwarf spheroidals, where the orbital
anisotropy is a key element in an unbiased mass inference.

quasi-monochromatic electromagnetic pulse through a slab with Lorentz
dielectric response in the epsilon-near-zero regime, where the real part of the
permittivity vanishes at the pulse carrier frequency. We show that the pulse is
able to excite a set of virtual polariton modes supported by the slab, the
excitation undergoing a generally slow damping due to absorption and radiation
leakage. Our numerical and analytical approaches indicate that in its transient
dynamics the electromagnetic field displays the very same enhancement of the
field component perpendicular to the slab, as in the monochromatic regime. The
transient trapping is inherently accompanied by a significantly reduced group
velocity ensuing from the small dielectric permittivity, thus providing a novel
platform for achieving control and manipulation of slow light.

means of classical density functional theory applied to a lattice model. Within
the present model the pure, i.e., salt-free solvent, for which all interactions
are of the nearest-neighbor type only, exhibits a second-order wetting
transition for all strengths of the substrate-particle and the
particle-particle interactions for which the wetting transition temperature is
nonzero. The influences of the substrate charge density and of the ionic
strength on the wetting transition temperature and on the order of the wetting
transition are studied. If the substrate is neutral, the addition of salt to
the solvent changes neither the order nor the transition temperature of the
wetting transition of the system. If the surface charge is nonzero, upon adding
salt this continuous wetting transition changes to first-order within the wide
range of substrate surface charge densities and ionic strengths studied here.
As the substrate surface charge density is increased, at fixed ionic strength,
the wetting transition temperature decreases and the prewetting line associated
with the first-order wetting transition becomes longer. This decrease of the
wetting transition temperature upon increasing the surface charge density
becomes more pronounced by decreasing the ionic strength.

formula $\varphi$ which measures how the free variables are spread in
$\varphi$. We show that for conjunctive queries that admit nice decomposition
properties (such as being of bounded treewidth or generalized hypertree width)
bounded quantified star size exactly characterizes the classes of queries for
which counting the number of solutions is tractable. This also allows us to
fully characterize the conjunctive queries for which counting the solutions is
tractable in the case of bounded arity. To illustrate the applicability of our
results, we also show that computing the quantified star size of a formula is
possible in time $n^{O(k)}$ for queries of generalized hypertree width $k$.
Furthermore, quantified star size is even fixed parameter tractable
parameterized by some other width measures, while it is $\W{1}$-hard for
generalized hypertree width and thus unlikely to be fixed parameter tractable.
We finally show how to compute an approximation of quantified star size in
polynomial time where the approximation ratio depends on the width of the

wind bubble induces a bow shock-shaped inner shell which at least superficially
resembles Betelgeuse's bow shock, and has a similar mass. Surrounding this is

computing and cognition, with information compression as a unifying theme. This
article discusses how it may be applied to the understanding of natural vision
and the development of computer vision. The theory, which is described quite
fully elsewhere, is described here in outline but with enough detail to ensure
that the rest of the article makes sense.
  Low level perceptual features such as edges or corners may be identified by
the extraction of redundancy in uniform areas in a manner that is comparable
with the run-length encoding technique for information compression.
  The concept of multiple alignment in the SP theory may be applied to the
recognition of objects, and to scene analysis, with a hierarchy of parts and
sub-parts, and at multiple levels of abstraction.
  The theory has potential for the unsupervised learning of visual objects and
classes of objects, and suggests how coherent concepts may be derived from
fragments.
  As in natural vision, both recognition and learning in the SP system is
robust in the face of errors of omission, commission and substitution.
  The theory suggests how, via vision, we may piece together a knowledge of the
three-dimensional structure of objects and of our environment, it provides an
account of how we may see things that are not objectively present in an image,
and how we recognise something despite variations in the size of its retinal
image. And it has things to say about the phenomena of lightness constancy and
colour constancy, the role of context in recognition, and ambiguities in visual
perception.
  A strength of the SP theory is that it provides for the integration of vision
with other sensory modalities and with other aspects of intelligence.

to be equal, i.e. when the thermodynamic system is two dimensional, there is a
complete agreement between the divergences of the generalized susceptibilities
and the singularities of the equilibrium manifold, whereas when the two angular
momenta are fully independent, that is, when the thermodynamic system is three
dimensional, additional singularities in the curvature appear. However, we
prove that such singularities are due to the changing from a stable phase to an
unstable one.

background (CMB) observation to constrain the total neutrino mass $\mnu$ in a
flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We adopt self-calibration for the mass-observable
scaling relation, and evaluate constraints for the South Pole Telescope normal
and with polarization (SPT, SPTPol), Planck, and Atacama Cosmology Telescope
Polarization (ACTPol) surveys. We find that a sample of $\approx1000$ clusters
obtained from the Planck cluster survey plus extra information from CMB lensing
extraction could tighten the current upper bound on the sum of neutrino masses
to $\sigma_{\mnu}=0.17$ eV at 68% C.L. Our analysis shows that cluster number
counts and power spectrum provide complementary constraints and as a result
they help reducing the error bars on $\mnu$ by a factor of 4-8 when both probes
are combined. We also show that the main strength of cluster measurements in
constraining $\mnu$ is when good control of cluster systematics is available.
When applying a weak prior on the mass-observable relations, which can be at
reach in the upcoming cluster surveys, we obtain $\sigma_{\mnu}=0.48$ eV using
cluster only probes and, more interestingly, $\sigma_{\mnu}=0.08$ eV using
cluster + CMB which corresponds to a $S/N\approx4$ detection for $\mnu\ge0.3$

the description of critical geometrical problems (percolation, self avoiding

(transition between plateaus in the integer and spin quantum Hall effects).
Much progress in their understanding has been obtained by studying algebraic
features of their lattice regularizations. For reasons which are not entirely
understood, the non semi-simple associative algebras underlying these lattice
models - such as the Temperley-Lieb algebra or the blob algebra - indeed
exhibit, in finite size, properties that are in full correspondence with those
of their continuum limits. This applies to the structure of indecomposable
modules, but also to fusion rules, and provides an `experimental' way of
measuring couplings, such as the `number b' quantifying the logarithmic
coupling of the stress energy tensor with its partner. Most results obtained so
far have concerned boundary LCFTs, and the associated indecomposability in the
chiral sector. While the bulk case is considerably more involved (mixing in
general left and right moving sectors), progress has also been made in this
direction recently, uncovering fascinating structures. This article provides a
short general review of our work in this area.

were previously absent from the uncharged structure. Remarkably, the addition

phenomena are highly sensitive to carbon edges. Specifically, armchair
nanotriangles display sharp plasmons that are associated with intense
near-field enhancement, as well as absorption cross-sections exceeding the
geometrical area occupied by the graphene. In contrast, zigzag triangles do not
support these plasmons. Our conclusions rely on realistic quantum-mechanical
calculations, which are in ostensible disagreement with classical
electromagnetic simulations, thus revealing the quantum nature of the plasmons.

optical response is dominated by a characteristic bonding dipolar dimer mode

variability are very well-correlated in most cases in the Fermi blazars and the
lack of correlation in this case is anomalous. By analyzing the gamma-ray, OIR,

the location of the outburst in the jet during interval 2 was closer to the

markets, based on the assumption that the dynamics of many agents can be
averaged over in time and space. A popular idea that is based on this seemingly
intuitive notion is to dampen electric power fluctuations from fluctuating
sources (as e.g. wind or solar) via a market mechanism, namely by variable
power prices that adapt demand to supply. The standard model of an average
economic agent predicts that fluctuations are reduced by such an adaptive
pricing mechanism.
  However, the underlying assumption that the actions of all agents average out
on the time axis is not always true in a market of many agents. We numerically
study an econophysics agent model of an adaptive power market that does not
assume averaging a priori. We find that when agents are exposed to source noise
via correlated price fluctuations (as adaptive pricing schemes suggest), the
market may amplify those fluctuations. In particular, small price changes may
translate to large load fluctuations through catastrophic consumer
synchronization. As a result, an adaptive power market may cause the opposite
effect than intended: Power fluctuations are not dampened but amplified
instead.

fluid reaches a temperature of ~ 1 keV and cools efficiently through optically
thin, thermal bremsstrahlung emission. The radiation from the shocked wind

is complicated by the inability of simplified multi-colour disc models to
distinguish between changes in the inner disc radius and alterations to the
emergent spectrum, parameterised by the phenomenological colour correction
factor, f_col. We analyse Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observations of the low
mass Galactic black hole X-ray binary, GX 339-4, taken over seven epochs when
the source was experiencing a state transition. The accretion disc component is
isolated using a pipeline resulting in robust detections for disc luminosities,
0.001 < L_disc / L_Edd < 0.5. Assuming that the inner disc remains situated at
the innermost stable circular orbit over the course of a state transition, we
measure the relative degree of change in f_col required to explain the spectral
evolution of the disc component. A variable f_col that increases by a factor of
~ 2.0 - 3.5 as the source transitions from the high/soft state to the low/hard
state can adequately explain the observed disc spectral evolution. For the
observations dominated by a disc component, the familiar scaling between the
disc luminosity and effective temperature, L_disc ~ T_eff^4, is observed;
however, significant deviations from this relation appear when GX 339-4 is in
the hard intermediate and low/hard states. Allowing for an evolving f_col
between spectral states, the L_disc-T_eff^4 law is recovered over the full
range of disc luminosities, although this depends heavily on the physically
conceivable range of f_col. We demonstrate that physically reasonable changes

literature to simulations of isolated mergers. We probe three different
redshifts, and several halo concentrations, mass ratios, orbital circularities
and orbital energies of the satellite. We find that prescriptions available in
the literature significantly under-predict long timescales for mergers at high
redshift. We argue that these results have not been highlighted previously
either because the evolution of halo concentration of satellite galaxies has
been neglected (in previous isolated merger simulations), or because long
merger times and mergers with high initial orbital circularities are
under-represented (for prescriptions based on cosmological simulations).
Motivated by the evolution of halo concentration at fixed mass, an explicit
dependence on redshift added as t_merger,modified(z) = (1+z)^0.44 t_merger to
the prescription based on isolated mergers gives a significant improvement in
the predicted merger times up to ~20 t_dyn in the redshift range 0<z<2. When
this modified prescription is used to compute galaxy stellar mass functions, we
find that it leads up to a 25 per cent increase in the number of low mass
galaxies surviving at z=0, and a 10 per cent increase for more massive
galaxies. This worsen the known over-prediction in the number of low mass
galaxies by hierarchical models of galaxy formation.

star-formation process, but is still poorly characterized observationally.
Aims. We have studied the 10 pc-long L1495/B213 complex in Taurus to
investigate how dense cores have condensed out of the lower-density cloud
material. Results. From the N$_2$H$^+$ emission, we identify 19 dense cores,
some starless and some protostellar. They are not distributed uniformly, but
tend to cluster with relative separations on the order of 0.25 pc. From the
C$^{18}$O emission, we identify multiple velocity components in the gas. We
have characterized them by fitting gaussians to the spectra, and by studying
the distribution of the fits in position-position-velocity space. In this
space, the C$^{18}$O components appear as velocity-coherent structures, and we
have identified them automatically using a dedicated algorithm (FIVe: Friends
In Velocity). Using this algorithm, we have identified 35 filamentary
components with typical lengths of 0.5 pc, sonic internal velocity dispersions,
and mass-per-unit-length close to the stability threshold of isothermal
cylinders at 10 K. Core formation seems to have occurred inside the filamentary
components via fragmentation, with a small number of fertile components with
larger mass-per-unit-length being responsible for most cores in the cloud. At
large scales, the filamentary components appear grouped into families, which we
refer to as bundles. Conclusions. Core formation in L1495/B213 has proceeded by
hierarchical fragmentation. The cloud fragmented first into several pc-scale
regions. Each of these regions later fragmented into velocity-coherent
filaments of about 0.5 pc in length. Finally, a small number of these filaments
fragmented quasi-statically and produced the individual dense cores we see
today.

using the Fisher matrix approach for the CMB bispectrum. In doing so, we
include the effect of the CMB transfer functions and experimental noise
properties by employing the recently developed \textsf{SONG} code. The relation
is also shown in the language of effective theory so that it can be applied to
general single-field models. Using the bispectrum Fisher matrix and the central
values for equilateral and orthogonal non-Gaussianities found by the Planck
temperature survey, we provide forecasts on the theoretical parameters of the
DBI galileon model. We consider the upcoming Planck polarisation data and the
proposed post-Planck experiments COrE and PRISM. We find that Planck
polarisation measurements may provide a hint for a non-canonical sound speed at
the 68% confidence level. COrE and PRISM will not only confirm a non-canonical
sound speed but also exclude the conventional DBI inflation model at more than
the 95% and 99% confidence level respectively, assuming that the central values

even the location of the gamma-ray emission region is still not clearly

algebra and enumerative combinatorics, and play a crucial role in Batyrev's and
Borisov's computation of Hodge numbers of mirror-symmetric generic Calabi-Yau
complete intersections. In this paper, we report on what is known about smooth
Gorenstein polytopes, i.e., Gorenstein polytopes whose normal fan is
unimodular. We classify d-dimensional smooth Gorenstein polytopes with index
larger than (d+3)/3. Moreover, we use a modification of Oebro's algorithm to
achieve classification results for smooth Gorenstein polytopes in low
dimensions. The first application of these results is a database of all toric
Fano d-folds whose anticanonical divisor is divisible by an integer r larger
than d-8. As a second application we verify that there are only finitely many
families of Calabi-Yau complete intersections of fixed dimension that are
associated to a smooth Gorenstein polytope via the Batyrev-Borisov
construction.

these patterns. An emphasis is placed on a previously proposed low-intensity,
all-optical switching scheme designed to exploit these instability-driven
patterns. Simulations and detailed analyses of simplified and more physically
transparent models are used. Two aspects are studied in detail. First we study
the dependencies of the stability behaviors of various patterns, as well as
transition time scales, on parameters relevant to the switching action(the
degree of built-in azimuthal anisotropy in the system and the switching beam
intensity). It is found that if the parameters are varied, the pattern system
undergoes abrupt transitions at threshold parameter values which are
accompanied by multiple-stability and hysteresis behaviors. Moreover, during a
real-time switching action, the transient dynamics of the system may depend
significantly on the proximity of unstable patterns. The second aspect is a
classification and detailed analysis of the polariton scattering processes
contributing to the pattern dynamics, giving us an understanding of the
selection and control of patterns as results of these processes' intricate
interplay. The crucial role played by the relative phases of the polariton
field in determining the gains or losses of polariton densities in various
momentum modes is highlighted, and interpretation of the actions of the various
processes in terms of concepts commonly used in classical pattern-forming
systems is given.

process (such as L_{bol}, black hole mass MBH, and Eddington ratio L/LEdd) and
the properties of narrow emission lines (as represented by [O III] 5007), using
large data sets derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Spectroscopic Survey (SDSS)
and the Wide Infrared Sky Survey (WISE). Firstly we find that the luminosity of
the [O III] wing component (Lwing) correlates more tightly with the continuum
luminosity (L5100) than the luminosity of the line core component (Lcore) does,
which is in line with our previous conclusion that the wing component,
generally blueshifted, originates from the polar outflows in the inner
narrow-line region (NLR). We then find that the MIR CF shows the strongest
correlation with Lwing/L_{bol} rather than with Lcore/L_{bol} or the above
fundamental AGN parameters, and the correlation becomes stronger as the
infrared wavelength increases. We also confirm the anti-correlations of
CF_{MIR} with L_{bol} and MBH, and the lack of dependence of CF_{MIR} on the
Eddington ratio. These results suggest that a large fraction of the warm dust
producing MIR emission in AGNs is likely embedded in polar outflows in the NLR

the number of surviving stars in galaxies, the chemical composition of the
interstellar medium, and the distribution of light in galaxies. A key unsolved
question is whether the IMF is universal in time and space. Here we use
state-of-the-art results of stellar evolution to show that the IMF of our
Galaxy made a transition from an IMF dominated by massive stars to the
present-day IMF at an early phase of the Galaxy formation. Updated results from
stellar evolution in a wide range of metallicities have been implemented in a
binary population synthesis code, and compared with the observations of
carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in our Galaxy. We find that applying
the present-day IMF to Galactic halo stars causes serious contradictions with
four observable quantities connected with the evolution of AGB stars.
Furthermore, a comparison between our calculations and the observations of CEMP
stars may help us to constrain the transition metallicity for the IMF which we
tentatively set at [Fe/H] = -2. A novelty of the current study is the inclusion
of mass loss suppression in intermediate-mass AGB stars at low-metallicity.
This significantly reduces the overproduction of nitrogen-enhanced stars that
was a major problem in using the high-mass star dominated IMF in previous
studies. Our results also demonstrate that the use of the present day IMF for
all time in chemical evolution models results in the overproduction of Type I.5
supernovae. More data on stellar abundances will help to understand how the IMF
has changed and what caused such a transition.

determined from muonic hydrogen and the proton radius determined from atomic
hydrogen level transitions and ep elastic scattering. No generally accepted
resolution to the Puzzle has been found. Possible solutions generally fall into
one of three categories: the two radii are different due to novel
beyond-standard-model physics, the two radii are different due to novel aspects
of nucleon structure, and the two radii are the same, but there are
underestimated uncertainties or other issues in the ep experiments.
  The MUon proton Scattering Experiment (MUSE) at the Paul Scherrer Institut is
a simultaneous measurement of \mu^+ p and e^+ p elastic scattering, as well as
\mu^- p and e^- p elastic scattering, which will allow a determination of the
consistency of the \mu p and the ep interactions. The differences between + and
- charge scattering are sensitive to two-photon exchange effects, higher-order
corrections to the scattering process. The slopes of the cross sections as Q^2
-> 0 determine the proton ""radius"". We plan to measure relative cross sections
at a typical level of a few tenths of a percent, which should allow the proton
radius to be determined at the level of ~0.01 fm, similar to previous ep
measurements. The measurements will test several possible explanations of the
proton radius puzzle, including some models of beyond-standard-model physics,
some models of novel hadronic physics, and some issues in the radius extraction
from scattering data.

rebrightening being observed at optical wavelength at about 3000 s after the
burst. One possible explanation is that the rebrightening is resulted from
energy injection. Here, we present a detailed numerical study of the energy
injection process and interpret the X-ray and optical afterglow light curves of
GRB 081029. In our model, we have assumed two periods of energy injection, each
with a constant injection power. One injection starts at $2.8\times10^{3}$ s
and lasts for about 2500 s, with a power of $7.0\times10^{47}$ ${\rm erg}$
${\rm s^{-1}}$. This energy injection is mainly engaged to account for the
rapid rebrightening at about 3000 s. The other injection starts at
$8.0\times10^{3}$ s and lasts for about 5000 s. The injection power is
$3.5\times10^{47}$ ${\rm erg}$ ${\rm s^{-1}}$. This energy injection can help
to explain the slight rebrightening at about 10000 s. It is shown that the
observed optical afterglow, especially the marked rebrightening at about 3000
s, can be well reproduced. In X-ray band, the predicted amplitude of the
rebrightening is much shallower, which is also consistent with the observed
X-ray afterglow light curve. It is argued that the two periods of energy
injection can be produced by the falling of clumpy materials onto the central
compact object of the burster, which leads to an enhancement of accretion and
gives birth to a strong outflow temporarily.

understanding of the replica method are proposed. The Bethe approximation is an
efficient approximation for graphical models, which gives an asymptotically
accurate estimate of the partition function for many graphical models. The
Bethe approximation explains the well-known message passing algorithm, belief
propagation, which is exact for tree graphical models. It is also known that
the cluster variational method gives the generalized Bethe approximation,
called the Kikuchi approximation, yielding the generalized belief propagation.
In the thesis, a new series of generalization of the Bethe approximation is
proposed, which is named the asymptotic Bethe approximation. The asymptotic
Bethe approximation is derived from the characterization of the Bethe free
energy using graph covers, which was recently obtained by Vontobel. The
asymptotic Bethe approximation can be expressed in terms of the edge zeta
function by using Watanabe and Fukumizu's result about the Hessian of the Bethe
entropy. The asymptotic Bethe approximation is confirmed to be better than the
conventional Bethe approximation on some conditions. For this purpose, Chertkov
and Chernyak's loop calculus formula is employed, which shows that the error of
the Bethe approximation can be expressed as a sum of weights corresponding to
generalized loops, and generalized for non-binary finite alphabets by using
concepts of information geometry.

favors the fixation of G/C alleles over A/T alleles. In mammals, gBGC is
hypothesized to contribute to variation in GC content, rapidly evolving
sequences, and the fixation of deleterious mutations, but its prevalence and
general functional consequences remain poorly understood. gBGC is difficult to
incorporate into models of molecular evolution and so far has primarily been
studied using summary statistics from genomic comparisons. Here, we introduce a
new probabilistic model that captures the joint effects of natural selection
and gBGC on nucleotide substitution patterns, while allowing for correlations
along the genome in these effects. We implemented our model in a computer
program, called phastBias, that can accurately detect gBGC tracts ~1 kilobase
or longer in simulated sequence alignments. When applied to real primate genome
sequences, phastBias predicts gBGC tracts that cover roughly 0.3% of the human
and chimpanzee genomes and account for 1.2% of human-chimpanzee nucleotide
differences. These tracts fall in clusters, particularly in subtelomeric
regions; they are enriched for recombination hotspots and fast-evolving
sequences; and they display an ongoing fixation preference for G and C alleles.
We also find some evidence that they contribute to the fixation of deleterious
alleles, including an enrichment for disease-associated polymorphisms. These
tracts provide a unique window into historical recombination processes along
the human and chimpanzee lineages; they supply additional evidence of long-term
conservation of megabase-scale recombination rates accompanied by rapid
turnover of hotspots. Together, these findings shed new light on the
evolutionary, functional, and disease implications of gBGC. The phastBias

attention in the past few years. In particular, using GPUs for general purpose

signifi- cantly relegated the role of CPUs in computation. As CPUs evolve and
also offer matching computational resources, it is important to also include
CPUs in the computation. We call this the hybrid computing model. Indeed, most
computer systems of the present age offer a degree of heterogeneity and
therefore such a model is quite natural.
  We reevaluate the claim of a recent paper by Lee et al.(ISCA 2010). We argue
that the right question arising out of Lee et al. (ISCA 2010) should be how to
use a CPU+GPU platform efficiently, instead of whether one should use a CPU or
a GPU exclusively. To this end, we experiment with a set of 13 diverse
workloads ranging from databases, image processing, sparse matrix kernels, and
graphs. We experiment with two different hybrid platforms: one consisting of a
6-core Intel i7-980X CPU and an NVidia Tesla T10 GPU, and another consisting of
an Intel E7400 dual core CPU with an NVidia GT520 GPU. On both these platforms,
we show that hybrid solutions offer good advantage over CPU or GPU alone
solutions. On both these platforms, we also show that our solutions are 90%

achievable rates in bits/s/Hz and the spatial throughput of bipolar Poisson
wireless networks in bits/s/Hz/m$^2$. We assume that all transmitters have a
cognitive ability to know the distance to their receiver's closest interferers
so they can individually tune their coding rates to avoid outage events for
each spatial realization. Considering that the closest interferer approximates
the aggregate interference of all transmitters treated as noise, we derive
closed-form expressions for the probability density function of the achievable
rates under two decoding rules: treating interference as noise, and jointly
detecting the strongest interfering signals treating the others as noise. Based
on these rules and the bipolar model, we approximate the expected maximum
spatial throughput, showing the best performance of the latter decoding rule.
These results are also compared to the reference scenario where the
transmitters do not have cognitive ability, coding their messages at
predetermined rates that are chosen to optimize the expected spatial throughput
-- regardless of particular realizations -- which yields outages. We prove
that, when the same decoding rule and network density are considered, the
cognitive spatial throughput always outperforms the other option.

activity in the e-commerce, such as music, book, and movie rating, are
comprehensively investigated by using detrended fluctuation analysis technique
and multiscale entropy method. Firstly, the interevent time series of rating
behaviors of these three type medias show the similar scaling property with
exponents ranging from 0.53 to 0.58, which implies that the collective
behaviors of rating media follow a process embodying self-similarity and
long-range correlation. Meanwhile, by dividing the users into three groups
based their activities (i.e., rating per unit time), we find that the scaling
exponents of interevent time series in three groups are different. Hence, these
results suggest the stronger long-range correlations exist in these collective
behaviors. Furthermore, their information complexities vary from three groups.
To explain the differences of the collective behaviors restricted to three
groups, we study the dynamic behavior of human activity at individual level,
and find that the dynamic behaviors of a few users have extremely small scaling
exponents associating with long-range anticorrelations. By comparing with the
interevent time distributions of four representative users, we can find that
the bimodal distributions may bring the extraordinary scaling behaviors. These

under conditions of high temperature and pressure are crucial to understand the
interior of of large gaseous planets and other astrophysical bodies. At ultra
high pressures solid hydrogen has been predicted to transform into a quantum
fluid, because of its high zero point motion. Here we report first principles
two phase coexistence and Z method determinations of the melting line of solid
hydrogen in a pressure range spanning from 30 to 600 GPa. Our results suggest
that the melting line of solid hydrogen, as derived from classical molecular
dynamics simulations, reaches a minimum of 367 K at about 430 GPa, at higher
pressures the melting line of the atomics Cs IV phase regain a positive slope.
In view of the possible importance of quantum effects in hydrogen at such low
temperatures, we also determined the melting temperature of the atomic CsIV
phase at pressures of 400, 500, 600 GPa, employing Feynman path integral
simulations. These result in a downward shift of the classical melting line by
about 100 K, and hint at a possible secondary maximum in the melting line in
the region between 500 and 600 GPa, testifying to the importance of quantum
effects in this system. Combined, our results imply that the stability field of
the zero temperature quantum liquid phase, if it exists at all, would only
occur at higher pressures than previously thought.

well as Support Vector Machines for quaternary classification. The method
exploits the notion of widely linear estimation to model the input-out relation
for complex-valued data and considers two cases: a) the complex data are split
into their real and imaginary parts and a typical real kernel is employed to
map the complex data to a complexified feature space and b) a pure complex
kernel is used to directly map the data to the induced complex feature space.
The recently developed Wirtinger's calculus on complex reproducing kernel
Hilbert spaces (RKHS) is employed in order to compute the Lagrangian and derive
the dual optimization problem. As one of our major results, we prove that any
complex SVM/SVR task is equivalent with solving two real SVM/SVR tasks
exploiting a specific real kernel which is generated by the chosen complex
kernel. In particular, the case of pure complex kernels leads to the generation
of new kernels, which have not been considered before. In the classification
case, the proposed framework inherently splits the complex space into four
parts. This leads naturally in solving the four class-task (quaternary
classification), instead of the typical two classes of the real SVM. In turn,
this rationale can be used in a multiclass problem as a split-class scenario
based on four classes, as opposed to the one-versus-all method; this can lead
to significant computational savings. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed framework for regression and classification tasks that involve
complex data.

  Enhancement in 200 GeV Au+Au Collisions at RHIC (thesis)",,,,,"nucl-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In case of an UA(1) symmetry restoration in a hot and dense hadronic matter,
the mass of the produced hadrons and mesons can significantly change, and their
production cross-section can also be modified.
  In this M.Sc. Thesis I search for the signature of an eta' enhancement in the
PHENIX dilepton spectrum in 200 GeV Au+Au collisions, which has a significant
enhancement in the low-mass region, e.g. in the (0.1-1.0) GeV invariant
electron-positron mass range. This is also the region of the eta' meson's
Dalitz-decay (eta'->ee gamma), so the eta' enhancement might be responsible for
at least a part of the excess. Other mesons' (other) properties can also be
changed in the hot, dense medium, but in this thesis I focus on the mass
modification of the eta' meson. To explore the role of eta', I used EXODUS
simulations to generate different dilepton spectra, corresponding to different
eta' properties. The conclusion here was that the excess can not be described
with just the eta' mass modification, but the agreement with data has been
improved significantly.
  Another idea which might brings us closer to understand the excess is to
examine the radial flow of the mesons, which was not included in the original
PHENIX analysis. Radial flow is important in the low-pT range, where it
describes the particles' spectra well: just in the region where the dilepton
spectrum has the most contributions from. Thus examining the effect of the
radial flow seems to be inevitable, as it might be responsible for certain
parts of the excess.
  The results summarized here are work in progress, obtained with the framework
of the PHENIX Collaboration at RHIC.

introduce Lambda-Actor, a prototypical functional language with
pattern-matching algebraic data types, augmented with process creation and
asynchronous message-passing primitives. We formalise an abstract model of
Lambda-Actor programs called Actor Communicating System (ACS) which has a
natural interpretation as a vector addition system, for which some verification
problems are decidable. We give a parametric abstract interpretation framework
for Lambda-Actor and use it to build a polytime computable, flow-based,
abstract semantics of Lambda-Actor programs, which we then use to bootstrap the
ACS construction, thus deriving a more accurate abstract model of the input
program. We have constructed Soter, a tool implementation of the verification
method, thereby obtaining the first fully-automatic, infinite-state model
checker for a core fragment of Erlang. We find that in practice our abstraction
technique is accurate enough to verify an interesting range of safety
properties. Though the ACS coverability problem is Expspace-complete, Soter can
analyse these verification problems surprisingly efficiently.

were founded when Spain became a democratic nation in the late 1970s and with

mechanism behind the observations. A comprehensive set of simulations are

effect of rotation on the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium, R/L_n, beta_e,
Z_eff, and the fast particle content. The effect of toroidal flow shear itself
is not predicted by the simulations to lead to a significant reduction in ion
heat flux, due both to an insufficient magnitude of flow shear and significant
parallel velocity gradient destabilisation. It is however found that non-linear
electromagnetic effects due to both thermal and fast-particle pressure
gradients, even at low beta_e, can significantly reduce the profile stiffness.
A total of five discharges are examined, at both inner and outer radii. For all
cases studied, the simulated and experimental ion heat flux values agree within
reasonable variations of input parameters around the experimental

explained within the framework of a shock wave propagating along a helical path
in the blazar's jet.

cryptography because it is a perfect secrecy system. For example, if an English
text (presented in binary system) $X_1 X_2 ... $ is enciphered according to the
formula $Z_i = (X_i + Y_i) \mod 2 $, where $Y_1 Y_2 ...$ is a key sequence
generated by the Bernoulli source with equal probabilities of 0 and 1, anyone
who knows $Z_1 Z_2 ... $ has no information about $X_1 X_2 ... $ without the
knowledge of the key $Y_1 Y_2 ...$. (The best strategy is to guess $X_1 X_2 ...
$ not paying attention to $Z_1 Z_2 ... $.)
  But what should one say about secrecy of an analogous method where the key
sequence $Y_1 Y_2 ...$ is generated by the Bernoulli source with a small bias,
say, $P(0) = 0.49, $ $ P(1) = 0.51$? To the best of our knowledge, there are no
theoretical estimates for the secrecy of such a system, as well as for the
general case where $X_1 X_2 ... $ (the plaintext) and key sequence are
described by stationary ergodic processes. We consider the running-key ciphers
where the plaintext and the key are generated by stationary ergodic sources and
show how to estimate the secrecy of such systems. In particular, it is shown
that, in a certain sense, the Vernam cipher is robust to small deviations from
randomness.

from the theoretical control of QED final-state bremsstrahlung. At present, it
is estimated at the 0.3% level for the shape of the phi-star distribution. In
this paper we discuss the possible effects of the second-order QED matrix
element for that quantity. For that purpose, results from simulations based on
the Yennie--Frautchi--Suura (YFS) exponentiation and featuring the second-order
matrix elements are used and compared with the case when the matrix element is
restricted to the first order. From this study we conclude that in order to
reach the precision below 0.3% for the phi-star distribution at the LHC,
inclusion of the second-order QED matrix element in a respective Monte Carlo
event generator is necessary.

combine the characteristics of individual graph layers using tools from

be viewed as a low dimensional representation of the original data which
preserves the most important information from diverse relationships between

superior or competitive performances compared to baseline and state-of-the-art

the analysis proposed in

fitted the quantity $\tilde{M}(H)=M+(dM/dH)H$ with a crossover function to
indentify $H^{*}$. The $T^{*}(H)$ line follows an almost linear $H$-dependence
at sufficiently high fields outside the AFM phase, but it deviates from
linearity at $T \le T_{\mathrm{N}}(0)$ and in

polarized spin-states that can be controlled with a perpendicular electric
field. Here we use first-principles calculations to show that field-gated
silicene possesses two gapped Dirac cones exhibiting nearly 100%

fact, we propose a design for a silicene-based spin-filter that should enable
the spin-polarization of an output current to be switched electrically, without
switching external magnetic fields. Our quantum transport calculations indicate
that the proposed designs will be highly efficient (nearly 100% spin

is specifically chosen for its predominately northward directed magnetic field,
so that the influence from the momentum flux onto Earth can be isolated. We
focus our study on understanding how a small Earth-directed segment propagates.
Mass images are created from the white-light cameras onboard STEREO which are
also converted into mass height-time maps (mass J-maps). The mass tracks on
these J-maps correspond to the sheath region between the CME and its associated
shock front as detected by in situ measurements at L1. A time-series of mass
measurements from the STEREO COR-2A instrument are made along the Earth
propagation direction. Qualitatively, this mass time-series shows a remarkable
resemblance to the L1 in situ density series. The in situ measurements are used
as inputs into a 3D magnetospheric space weather simulation from CCMC. These
simulations display a sudden compression of the magnetosphere from the large
momentum flux at the leading edge of the CME and predictions are made for the
time-derivative of the magnetic field (dB/dt) on the ground. The predicted
dB/dt were then compared with observations from specific equatorially-located
ground stations and show notable similarity. This study of the momentum of a
CME from the Sun down to its influence on magnetic ground stations on Earth is
presented as preliminary proof of concept, such that future attempts may try to
use remote sensing to create density and velocity time-series as inputs to
magnetospheric simulations.

limits of wireless systems where the co-channel interference is the main
limiting factor is described and hence contextualized in the perspective of
complex systems. Specifically some possible internal and external pressures
that the network elements may suffer are identified as, for example, queue
stability, maximum packet loss rate and transmit power constraint. Besides,
other important external factors such as mobility and incoming traffic are also
pointed out. As a study case, a decentralized point-to-point interference
network is described and several claims about the optimal design setting for
different network states and under two mobility conditions, namely quasi-static
and highly mobile, are stated based on results found in the literature. Using
these claims as a background, the design of a robust adaptive algorithm that
each network element should run is investigated.

field theories with $N_{max}=4$ supersymmetries in four dimensions, if only
such symmetries are fundamental to nature, yield the possible 'extension of

framework of local MS-SUSY, we address the inertial effects. We argue that a
space-time deformation of MS is the origin of inertia effects that can be
observed by us. We go beyond the hypothesis of locality. This allows to improve
the relevant geometrical structures referred to the noninertial frame in
Minkowski space for an arbitrary velocities and characteristic acceleration
lengths. This framework furnishes justification for the introduction of the
'weak' principle of equivalence, i.e., the 'universality of free fall'. The
implications of the inertia effects in the more general post-Riemannian

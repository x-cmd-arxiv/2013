and naturally include autocatalytic processes. The formalism is not widely
known but has great unexplored potential for applications to systems
interacting with environments. Beginning with links of contextuality to
non-Kolmogorovity we introduce the general formalism of soliton rate equations
and work out explicit examples of subsystems interacting with environments. Of
particular interest is the case of a soliton autocatalytic rate equation
coupled to a linear conservative environment, a formal way of expressing
seasonal changes. Depending on strength of the system-environment coupling we
observe phenomena analogous to hibernation or even complete blocking of decay
of a population.

implemented. Furthermore, the issue of energy consumption of the used wireless
sensor node is addressed by modifying the intelligence of the used sensor.
After that, the design and components of the prototype used for the energy

  Gene","61 pages, 13 figures. Undergraduate honors thesis submitted to the
  University of Chicago Honors Program in Biology",,,,"q-bio.PE q-bio.CB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dominant negative mutations in the insulin gene are the second most common
cause of permanent neonatal diabetes. However, variation in severity and
penetrance of neonatal diabetes, as in other complex genetic diseases, cannot
be accounted for by known disease mutations. In a novel approach to this
problem, we have utilized the genetic tools available in Drosophila to model
the effects of the C96Y mutation, a cysteine to tyrosine mutation in the
insulin protein that can cause permanent neonatal diabetes in humans. This
mutation, which disrupts a disulfide bridge in the proinsulin molecule, has
been shown to lead to partial protein unfolding and aggregation in the
endoplasmic reticulum. It is thought to induce beta cell death in humans and
mice through endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis. We employed the
UAS/GAL4 system to create a stable fly laboratory stock expressing human
insulin with the C96Y mutation (INSC96Y) in the Drosophila eye. We crossed
these transgenic INSC96Y flies to 36 isogenic lines derived from a wild
population. The F1 flies displayed a disrupted eye development phenotype, with
both reduced eye size and irregularity in ommatidia, which varied between lines
and with sex. By backcrossing F1 offspring to their wild parents, we were able
to analyze the effects of naturally occurring genetic variation on the INSC96Y
phenotype in flies both heterozygous and homozygous for wild third chromosomes.
We observed significant differences between lines in terms of eye size, eye
shape, the presence or absence of lesions, and degree of ommatidial structure
present, indicating that an approach that takes into account quantitative
variation in the genetic background can yield valuable insights into the
phenotypic severity and penetrance of a complex genetic disease.

models disregard the role of the male individuals as the passive carriers of
the strategy genes. In the previous two papers in this cycle, a new model
combining the strategic analysis with more rigorous genetics was presented. The
new model shows that sex ratio self-regulation is a multistage complex process

elements of this process is the dynamic equilibrium between male and female
gene carriers associated with convergence of the dynamics to the manifold
termed the male subpopulation equilibrium (MSE). This paper attempts to explain
this phenomenon and analyze its properties. We show that the MSE phenomenon
affects every stage of sex ratio self-regulation (Lemmas 1-4). The MSE plays a
crucial role in synchronizing two levels of selection in the double-level
selection process. We show that the MSE condition can be generalized as an
interesting synergistic property allowing for the estimation of the primary sex
ratio of the entire population according to the state of some arbitrarily
chosen subpopulation (Lemma 5). We also show that the classical Dusing Fisher
Shaw Mohler fitness measure is a biased approximation of the new approach, but
that it produces compatible strategic predictions (Lemma 6).

non-linear regimes of structure formation. In these models the energy density
of dark energy is non-negligible at high redshifts and the fluctuations in the
dark energy component can have the same order of magnitude of dark matter
fluctuations. Since two basic approximations usually taken in the standard
scenario of quintessence models, that both dark energy density during the
matter dominated period and dark energy fluctuations on small scales are
negligible, are not valid in such models, we first study approximate analytical
solutions for dark matter and dark energy perturbations in the linear regime.
This study is helpful to find consistent initial conditions for the system of
equations and to analytically understand the effects of Early Dark Energy and
its fluctuations, which are also verified numerically. In the linear regime we
compute the matter growth and variation of the gravitational potential
associated with the Integrated Sachs-Wolf effect, showing that these
observables present important modifications due to Early Dark Energy
fluctuations, though making them more similar to $\Lambda$CDM model. We also
make use of the Spherical Collapse model to study the influence of Early Dark
Energy fluctuations in the nonlinear regime of structure formation, especially
on $\delta_c$ parameter, and their contribution to the halo mass, which we show
can be of the order of 10%. We finally compute how the number density of halos
is modified in comparison to $\Lambda$CDM model and address the problem of how
to correct the mass function in order to take into account the contribution of
clustered dark energy. We conclude that the inhomogeneous Early Dark Energy
models are more similar to $\Lambda$CDM model than its homogeneous
counterparts.

coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmissions in distributed antenna systems
(DAS). Traditional duality based optimization techniques cannot be directly
applied to this problem, because the non-strict concavity of the CoMP
transmission's achievable rate with respect to the transmission power induces
that the local power allocation subproblems have non-unique optimum solutions.
We propose a distributed power allocation algorithm to resolve this non-strict
concavity difficulty. This algorithm only requires local information exchange
among neighboring base stations serving the same user, and is thus scalable as
the network size grows. The step-size parameters of this algorithm are
determined by only local user access relationship (i.e., the number of users
served by each antenna), but do not rely on channel coefficients. Therefore,
the convergence speed of this algorithm is quite robust to different channel
fading coefficients. We rigorously prove that this algorithm converges to an
optimum solution of the power allocation problem. Simulation results are

belonging to those classes, such that the errors of approximation are of the

incorporating $\ell^p (0 < p \leq 2)$ regression into the NLM framework. This
general optimization framework, called Non-Local Patch Regression (NLPR),
contains NLM as a special case. Denoising results on synthetic and natural
images show that NLPR consistently performs better than NLM beyond a moderate
noise level, and significantly so when $p$ is close to zero. An iteratively
reweighted least-squares (IRLS) algorithm was proposed for solving the
regression problem in NLPR, where the NLM output was used to initialize the
iterations. Based on exhaustive numerical experiments, we observe that the IRLS
algorithm is globally convergent (for arbitrary initialization) in the convex
regime $1 \leq p \leq 2$, and locally convergent (fails very rarely using NLM
initialization) in the non-convex regime $0 < p < 1$. In this letter, we adapt
the ""majorize-minimize"" framework introduced in [Voss1980] to explain these

The aim of
this paper is to characterise the shape of the triangle, defined by two of its

consider a simple class of models for this process, involving a combination of
a random strain of the fluid and Brownian motion of the particles. Following D.
G. Kendall, we map the space of triangles to a sphere, whose equator
corresponds to degenerate triangles with colinear vertices, with equilaterals
at the poles. We map our model to a diffusion process on the surface of the
sphere and find an exact solution for the shape distribution. Whereas the
action of the random strain tends to make the shape of the triangles infinitely
elongated, in the presence of a Brownian diffusion of the vertices, the model
has an equilibrium distribution of shapes. We determine here exactly this shape
distribution in the simple case where the increments of the strain are
diffusive.

characteristic signatures of dynamical longevity (Scholl et al, 2005) while
their average orbits resemble that of the largest known Martian Trojan, 5261
Eureka. The group forms a cluster within the region where the most stable
Trojans should reside. Based on a combinatorial analysis and a comparison with
the Jovian Trojan population, we argue that both this feature and the apparent
paucity of km-sized Martian Trojans (Trilling et al, 2006) as compared to
expectations from earlier work (Tabachnik and Evans, 1999) is not due to
observational bias but instead a natural end result of the collisional
comminution (Jutzi et al, 2010) or, alternatively, the rotational fission
(Pravec et al, 2010) of a progenitor L5 Trojan of Mars. Under the collisional
scenario in particular, the new Martian Trojans are dynamically young, in
agreement with our age estimate of this ""cluster"" of < 2 Gyr based on the
earlier work of Scholl et al. This work highlights the Trojan regions of the
Terrestrial planets as natural laboratories to study processes important for
small body evolution in the solar system and provides the first direct evidence

possible to clone large numbers of heavy-chain light-chain pairs from
individual B cells and thereby identify whole sets of clonally related
antibodies. These collections could provide the information necessary to
reconstruct their own history--the sequence of changes introduced into the
lineage during the development of the clone--and to study affinity maturation
in detail. But the success of such a program depends entirely on accurately
inferring the founding ancestor and the other unobserved intermediates.
  I have developed an Empirical Bayes method that allows one to compute the
posterior distribution over ancestors, thereby giving a thorough accounting of
the uncertainty inherent in the reconstruction. I demonstrate the application

the inference, and discuss the sources of uncertainty.

process has the form of a causal set (causet) and the ""completed"" universe is
given by a path through a discretely growing chain of causets. We then quantize
the CSGP by forming a Hilbert space $H$ on the set of paths. The quantum
dynamics is governed by a sequence of positive operators $\rho_n$ on $H$ that
satisfy normalization and consistency conditions. The pair $(H,\brac{\rho_n})$
is called a quantum sequential growth process (QSGP). We next discuss a
concrete realization of a QSGP in terms of a natural quantum action. This gives

subequation of degenerate elliptic type on a manifold X. We study the question:
Which closed subsets E in X have the property that every F-subharmonic function
(subsolution) on X-E, which is locally bounded across E, extends to an
F-subharmonic function on X. We also study the related question for F-harmonic
functions (solutions) which are continuous across E. Main results assert that
if there exists a convex cone subequation M such that F+M is contained in F,
then any closed set E which is M-polar has these properties. To be M-polar
means that E = {f = -\infty} where f is M-subharmonic on X and smooth outside
of E. Many examples and generalizations are given. These include removable
singularity results for all branches of the complex and quaternionic
Monge-Ampere equations, and a general removable singularity result for the
harmonics of geometrically defined subequations.
  For pure second-order subequations in R^n with monotonicity cone M, the Riesz
characteristic p = p(M) is introduced, and extension theorems are proved for
any closed singular set E of locally finite Hausdorff (p-2)-measure (or, more
generally, of (p-2)-capacity zero). This applies for example to branches of the
equation s_k(D^2 u) = 0 (kth elementary function) where p(M) = n/k.
  For convex cone subequations themselves, several removable singularity
theorems are proved, independent of the results above.

law have shown a reconnection rate insensitive to the nature of the non-ideal
mechanism occuring at the X line, as soon as the Hall effect is operating.
Consequently, the dissipation mechanism occurring in the vicinity of the
reconnection site in collisionless systems is usually thought not to have a
dynamical role beyond the violation of the frozen-in condition. The
interpretation of recent studies have however led to the opposite conclusion
that the electron scale dissipative processes play an important dynamical role
in preventing an elongation of the electron layer from throttling the
reconnection rate. This work re-visits this topic with a new approach. Instead
of focusing on the extensively studied symmetric configuration, we aim to
investigate whether the macroscopic properties of collisionless reconnection
are affected by the dissipation physics in asymmetric configurations, for which
the effect of the Hall physics is substantially modified. because it includes
all the physical scales a priori important for collisionless reconnection (Hall
and ion kinetic physics) and also because it allows one to change the nature of
the non-ideal electron scale physics, we use a 2D hybrid model. The effects of
numerical, resistive and hyper-resistive dissipation are studied. In a first
part we perform simulations of symmetric reconnection with different non-ideal
electron physics. we show that the model captures the already known properties
of collisionless reconnection. In a second part, we focus on an asymmetric
configuration where the magnetic field strength and the density are both
asymmetric. Our results show that contrary to symmetric reconnection, the
asymmetric model evolution strongly depends on the nature of the mechanism
which breaks the field line connectivity

stable equilibrium points coincides with the set of minima of U, so that the
corresponding shapes of the curves obtained may be regarded as normal forms of
Euler elasticae. In this way, we find the solution of the Euler problem (set in

diffusion and growth in $\R^N$, and $u$ exists initially in a ball
$\{r<h(0)\}$, but invades into the environment with spreading front
$\{r=h(t)\}$, with $h(t)$ evolving according to the free boundary condition
$h'(t)=-\mu u_r(t, h(t))$, where $\mu>0$ is a given constant and $u(t,h(t))=0$.
Thus the population range of $u$ is the expanding ball $\{r<h(t)\}$, while that

have been carried out to examine the efficiency and wavelength dependence of
interstellar polarization. A total area of about 5.7 deg$^2$ is covered in the
$J$, $H$, and $K_S$ bands. We examined the polarization efficiency, defined as
the ratio of degree of polarization to color excess. The interstellar medium
between the Galactic center and us shows the polarization efficiency lower than
that in the Galactic disk by a factor of three. Moreover we investigated the
spatial variation of the polarization efficiency by comparing it with those of
color excess, degree of polarization, and position angle. The spatial
variations of color excess and degree of polarization depend on the Galactic
latitude, while the polarization efficiency varies independently of the
Galactic structure. Position angles are nearly parallel to the Galactic plane,
indicating the longitudinal magnetic field configuration between the Galactic
center and us. The polarization efficiency anticorrelates with dispersions of
position angles. The low polarization efficiency and its spatial variation can
be explained by the differences of the magnetic field directions along the
line-of-sight. From the lower polarization efficiency, we suggest a higher
strength of a random component relative to a uniform component of the magnetic
field between the Galactic center and us. We also derived the ratios of degree
of polarization $p_H/p_J$ = 0.581 $\pm$ 0.004 and $p_{K_S}/p_H$ = 0.620 $\pm$
0.002. The power law indices of the wavelength dependence of polarization are
$\beta_{JH}$ = 2.08 $\pm$ 0.02 and $\beta_{HK_S}$ = 1.76 $\pm$ 0.01. Therefore
the wavelength dependence of interstellar polarization exhibits flattening
toward longer wavelengths in the range of 1.25$-$2.14 $\micron$. The flattening
would be caused by aligned large-size dust grains.

  Varying Coefficient Models",,,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The varying-coefficient model is an important nonparametric statistical model
that allows us to examine how the effects of covariates vary with exposure
variables. When the number of covariates is big, the issue of variable
selection arrives. In this paper, we propose and investigate marginal
nonparametric screening methods to screen variables in ultra-high dimensional
sparse varying-coefficient models. The proposed nonparametric independence
screening (NIS) selects variables by ranking a measure of the nonparametric
marginal contributions of each covariate given the exposure variable. The sure
independent screening property is established under some mild technical
conditions when the dimensionality is of nonpolynomial order, and the
dimensionality reduction of NIS is quantified. To enhance practical utility and
the finite sample performance, two data-driven iterative NIS methods are
proposed for selecting thresholding parameters and variables: conditional
permutation and greedy methods, resulting in Conditional-INIS and Greedy-INIS.
The effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed methods are further
illustrated by simulation studies and real data applications.

severely constrained by vacuum stability. In order to relax the vacuum
meta-stability condition, we focus on the parameter region where the mass
difference between the two staus is large. This region has not been considered

the vacuum meta-stability condition sufficiently even if the lighter stau mass

enhancement of the Higgs to diphoton decay rate becomes small in spite of a
relaxation of the vacuum meta-stability condition. Because of this feature, an
O(70)% enhancement of the Higgs to diphoton decay rate is difficult to achieve
in the light stau scenario in the MSSM.

dependent light curves of the X-ray and soft gamma-ray radiations of the
spin-down powered pulsar PSR B1509-58.In the outer gap model, most pairs inside
the gap are created around the null charge surface and the gap's electric field
separates the two charges to move in opposite directions. Consequently, the
region from the null charge surface to the light cylinder is dominated by the
outflow of particles and that from the null charge surface to the star is
dominated by the inflow of particles. The inflow and outflow of particles move
along the magnetic field lines and emit curvature photons, and the incoming
curvature photons are converted to pairs by the strong magnetic field of the
star. These pairs emit synchrotron photons. We suggest that the X-rays and soft
gamma-rays of PSR B1509-58 result from the synchrotron radiation of these
pairs, and the viewing angle of PSR B1509-58 only receives the inflow
radiation. The magnetic pair creation requires a large pitch angle, which makes
the pulse profile of the synchrotron radiation distinct from that of the
curvature radiation. We carefully trace the pulse profiles of the synchrotron
radiation with different pitch angles. We find that the differences between the
light curves of different energy bands are due to the different pitch angles of
the secondary pairs, and the second peak appearing at E>10MeV comes from the
region near the star, where the stronger magnetic field allows the pair
creation to happen with a smaller pitch angle.

values to the corresponding saliency structures (called Joint Saliency
Structures, JSSs) but zero or low joint saliency values to the outliers (or
mismatches) that are introduced by missing correspondence or local large
deformations between the reference and moving images to be registered. JSM
guides the local structure matching in nonrigid registration by emphasizing
these JSSs' sparse deformation vectors in adaptive kernel regression of
hierarchical sparse deformation vectors for iterative dense deformation
reconstruction. By designing an effective superpixel-based local structure
scale estimator to compute the reference structure's structure scale, we
further propose to determine the scale (the width) of kernels in the adaptive
kernel regression through combining the structure scales to JSM-based scales of
mismatch between the local saliency structures. Therefore, we can adaptively
select the sample size of sparse deformation vectors to reconstruct the dense
deformation vectors for accurately matching the every local structures in the
two images. The experimental results demonstrate better accuracy of our method
in aligning two images with missing correspondence and local large deformation
than the state-of-the-art methods.

OMC) before and after the maximum of the optical light as well as the
interpretation in terms of the existing models of $\gamma$--ray emission from
such kind of supernovae are reported. All INTEGRAL high-energy have only been
able to provide upper limits to the expected emission due to the decay of
$^{56}$Ni. These bounds allow to reject explosions involving a massive white
dwarf in the sub--Chandrasekhar scenario. On the other hand, the optical light
curve obtained with the OMC camera suggests that the event was produced by a
delayed detonation of a CO white dwarf that produced $\sim 0.5$ M$\odot$ of
$^{56}$Ni. In this particular case, INTEGRAL would have only been able to
detect the early $\gamma$--ray emission if the supernova had occurred at a
distance of 2 -3 Mpc, although the brightest event could be visible up to
distances larger by a factor two.

studies, thermal fluctuations of the torsional angle between the phenyl rings
and variations in the position of the molecular level alignment with respect to
the electrode Fermi energy were both taken into account. Full thermopower
histograms were obtained, and their dependence on the magnitude of the
fluctuations was studied. We found that at large molecular orbital variations
the thermopower becomes strongly dependent on the torsion angle and can even
change sign. This results in a marked effect of fluctuations on the thermopower
distribution, yielding an average thermopower at high temperatures that differs
(smaller or larger) from the fluctuation-free value, depending on the strength
of fluctuations. We therefore conclude that fluctuations should be taken into

level-Fermi level offset, and in predictions of the thermopower of molecular

feasible in some isotropic materials (e.g. fused silica and photosensitive

misalignment between neighboring sub-gratings was pre-fabricated. In terms of
extension of interaction length in THG, our multi-layer sub-grating is formally
equivalent to the multi-layer periodically poled crystal (e.g. lithium niobate)

error probability and the undetected error probability are usually bounded by
or given from the weight distributions of the codes. Most researches are about
the determination of the weight distributions of cyclic codes with few
nonzeros, by using quadratic form and exponential sum but limited to low
moments. In this paper, we focus on the application of higher moments of the
exponential sum to determine the weight distributions of a class of ternary
cyclic codes with three nonzeros, combining with not only quadratic form but
also MacWilliams' identities. Another application of this paper is to emphasize
the computer algebra system Magma for the investigation of the higher moments.
In the end, the result is verified by one example using Matlab.

We analyze the relation between the time lags and temporal variabilities. We
find that the hard time lags accompany with the horizontal branch oscillations
(HBOs) and the soft time lags dominate the noise in the low frequency range
0.1-10 Hz on HB. In the Cyg-like phase, the time lags decrease on the middle
normal branch (NB) from HB/NB vertex to NB/FB vertex, whereas the time lags are
roughly invariant in the Sco-like source. We discuss that the Compton
upscattering by the corona introduces the soft lag in low frequency noise. We
interpret that the variation of the Comptonization component from the disk
emission lead to the HBOs' time lags evolution along the Z tracks. We also
report the rms amplitude spectrum and phase lag spectrum for the NBO. The
$\sim$ $160^{\circ}$ phase lag is found. We present that the rms amplitude of
both the Cyg-like and the Sco-like NBO linearly increase with the photon energy
in low energy bands, and it will drop in the highest energy band.

the abelian Higgs model vortex. It is shown that a such a system displays much
richer phenomenology than its static Schwarzschild or Reissner--Nordstrom
cousins, for example, the rotation generates a near horizon electric field. In
the case of an extremal rotating black hole, two phases of the Higgs hair are
possible: Large black holes exhibit standard hair, with the vortex piercing the
event horizon. Small black holes on the other hand, exhibit a flux-expelled
solution, with the gauge and scalar field remaining identically in their false
vacuum state on the event horizon. This solution however is extremely sensitive
to confirm numerically, and we conjecture that it is unstable due to a
supperradiant mechanism similar to the Kerr-adS instability. Finally, we
compute the gravitational back reaction of the vortex, which turns out to be
far more nuanced than a simple conical deficit. While the string produces a
conical effect, it is conical with respect to a local co-rotating frame, not
with respect to the static frame at infinity. As a consequence, we find that
the ergosphere is shifted, and geodesics around the black hole are perturbed.

is paid to the model of the so-called quarter stack with perfectly matched
layers (the same unperturbed by disorder impedances, $Z_a=Z_b$, and optical
path lengths, $n_ad_a=|n_b| d_b$, with $d_a$, $d_b$ being the thicknesses of
basic layers). As was recently numerically discovered, in such structures with
weak fluctuations of refractive indices (compositional disorder) the
localization length $L_{loc}$ is enormously large in comparison with the
conventional localization occurring in the structures with positive refraction
indices only. In this paper we develop a new approach which allows us to derive
the expression for $L_{loc}$ for weak disorder and any wave frequency $\omega$.
In the limit $\omega \rightarrow 0$ one gets a quite specific dependence,
$L^{-1}_{loc}\propto\sigma^4\omega^8$ which is obtained within the fourth order
of perturbation theory. We also analyze the interplay between two types of
disorder, when in addition to the fluctuations of $n_a$, $n_b$ the thicknesses
$d_a$, $d_b$ slightly fluctuate as well (positional disorder). We show how the
conventional localization recovers with an addition of positional disorder.

concept of inflation it explains the universe after the time of decoupling.
However there are still a few concerns; after much effort there is no detection
of dark matter and there are significant problems in the theoretical
description of dark energy. We will consider a variant of the cosmological
spherical shell model, within FRW formalism and will compare it with the
standard \Lambda CDM model. We will show that our new topological model
satisfies cosmological principles and is consistent with all observable data,
but that it may require new interpretation for some data. Considered will be
constraints imposed on the model, as for instance the range for the size and
allowed thickness of the shell, by the supernovae luminosity distance and CMB
data. In this model propagation of the light is confined along the shell, which
has as a consequence that observed CMB originated from one point or a limited
space region. It allows to interpret the uniformity of the CMB without
inflation scenario. In addition this removes any constraints on the uniformity
of the universe at the early stage and opens a possibility that the universe

the inhomogeneities that originated in the Big Bang.

  Optimization",,"International Journal of Advanced Research in Artificial

designed to expedite optimization problems that have computationally-expensive
multimodal objective functions. By never discarding individuals from the
population, the CMN GA makes use of the information from every objective
function evaluation as it explores the design space. A fitness-related
population density control over the design space reduces unnecessary objective
function evaluations. The algorithm's novel arrangement of genetic operations
provides fast and robust convergence to multiple local optima. Benchmark tests
alongside three other multi-niching algorithms show that the CMN GA has a
greater convergence ability and provides an order-of-magnitude reduction in the
number of objective function evaluations required to achieve a given level of
convergence.

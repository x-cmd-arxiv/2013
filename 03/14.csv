to test general relativity (GR) on the largest accessible scales.
Parameterizing modified gravity models facilitates the systematic testing of
the predictions of GR, and gives a framework for detecting possible deviations
from it. Several different parameterizations have already been suggested, some
linked to classifications of theories, and others more empirically motivated.
Here we describe a particular new approach which casts modifications to gravity
through two free functions of time and scale, which are directly linked to the
field equations, but also easy to confront with observational data. We compare
our approach with other existing methods of parameterizing modied gravity,
specifically the parameterized post-Friedmann approach and the older method
using the parameter set $\{\mu,\gamma\}$. We explain the connection between our
parameters and the physics that is most important for generating cosmic
microwave background anisotropies. Some qualitative features of this new
parameterization, and therefore modifications to the gravitational equations of
motion, are illustrated in a toy model, where the two functions are simply
assumed to be constant parameters.

LRISb spectra of 35 giants in the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy. The iron
abundances are derived by a spectrum synthesis modeling of the wavelength
region from 4850 to 5375 A, while calcium and carbon abundances are obtained by
fitting the Ca II H and K lines and the CH G band respectively. A range in
metallicity of -2.9 <= [Fe/H]} <= -1.6 is found within the giants sampled, with
a good correlation between [Fe/H] and [Ca/H]. The great majority of stars in
the sample would be classified as having weak absorption in the lambda 3883 CN
band, with only a small scatter in band strengths at a given luminosity on the
red giant branch. In this sense the behavior of CN among the Draco giants is
consistent with the predominantly weak CN bands found among red giants in
globular clusters of metallicity [Fe/H] < -1.8. Over half of the giants in the
Draco sample have [Fe/H] > -2.25, and among these there is a trend for the
[C/Fe] abundance to decrease with increasing luminosity on the red giant
branch. This is a phenomenon that is also seen among both field and globular
cluster giants of the Galactic halo, where it has been interpreted as a
consequence of deep mixing of material between the base of the convective
envelope and the outer limits of the hydrogen-burning shell. However, among the
six Draco giants observed that turn out to have metallicities -2.65 < [Fe/H] <
-2.25 there is no such trend seen in the carbon abundance. This may be due to
small sample statistics or primordial inhomogeneities in carbon abundance among
the most metal-poor Draco stars. We identify a potential carbon-rich extremely
metal-poor star in our sample. This candidate will require follow up
observations for confirmation.

45-dimensional vector spaces of states that account for the first order term in
the massive sector of the elliptic genus of K3 in every Z2-orbifold CFT on K3.
These generic states are uniquely characterized by the fact that the action of
every geometric symmetry group of a Z2-orbifold CFT yields a well-defined
faithful representation on them. Moreover, each such representation is obtained
by restriction of the 45-dimensional irreducible representation of the Mathieu
group M24 constructed by Margolin. Thus we provide a piece of evidence for
Mathieu Moonshine explicitly from SCFTs on K3.
  The 45-dimensional irreducible representation of M24 exhibits a twist, which
we prove can be undone in the case of Z2-orbifold CFTs on K3 for all geometric
symmetry groups. This twist however cannot be undone for the combined symmetry

set of pairwise non-adjacent vertices. The independence polynomial of $G$ is
the polynomial $I(G,x)=\sum_{k=0}^{n} s(G,k) x^{k}$, where $s(G,k)$ is the
number of independent sets of $G$ of size $k$ and $s(G,0)=1$. Clearly all real
roots of $I(G,x)$ are negative. Let $\xi(G)$ be the largest real root of
$I(G,x)$. Let $H$ be a simple graph. By $G \succeq H$ we mean that $I(H,x)\geq
I(G,x)$ for every $x$ in the interval $[\xi(G),0]$. We note that $G\succeq H$
implies that $\xi(G)\geq \xi(H)$. Also we let $G\succ H$ if and only if
$G\succeq H$ and $I(G,x)\neq I(H,x)$. We prove that for every tree $T$ of order
$n$, $S_n\succeq T\succeq P_n$, where $S_n$ and $P_n$ are the star and the path
of order n, respectively. By $T=T(n_1,\ldots,n_k)$ we mean a tree $T$ which has
a vertex $v$ of degree $k$ such that $T\setminus v=P_{n_1-1}+\cdots+P_{n_k-1}$,
that is $T\setminus v$ is the disjoint union of the paths
$P_{n_1-1},\ldots,P_{n_k-1}$. Let $X=(x_1,\ldots,x_k)$ and
$Y=(y_1,\ldots,y_k)$, where $x_1\geq \cdots\geq x_k$ and $y_1\geq\cdots\geq
y_k$ are real. By $X\succ Y$, we mean $x_1=y_1,\ldots,x_{t-1}=y_{t-1}$ and
$x_t>y_t$ for some $t\in\{1,\ldots,k\}$. We let $X\succ_{d}Y$, if $X\neq Y$ and
for every $j$, $1\leq j\leq k$, $\sum_{i=1}^{j}x_i\geq \sum_{i=1}^{j}y_i$.
Among all trees with fixed number of vertices, we show that if
$(m_1,\ldots,m_k)\succ_{d}(n_1,\ldots,n_k)$, then $T(n_1,\ldots,n_k)\succ
T(m_1,\ldots,m_k)$. We conjecture that $T(n_1,\ldots,n_k)\succ

and treatments for both medical and non-medical users. Standard web search is
by far the most common interface for such information. It is therefore of
interest to find out how well web search engines work for diagnostic queries
and what factors contribute to successes and failures. Among diseases, rare (or
orphan) diseases represent an especially challenging and thus interesting class
to diagnose as each is rare, diverse in symptoms and usually has scattered
resources associated with it. Methods: We use an evaluation approach for web
search engines for rare disease diagnosis which includes 56 real life
diagnostic cases, state-of-the-art evaluation measures, and curated information
resources. In addition, we introduce FindZebra, a specialized (vertical) rare
disease search engine. FindZebra is powered by open source search technology
and uses curated freely available online medical information. Results:
FindZebra outperforms Google Search in both default setup and customised to the
resources used by FindZebra. We extend FindZebra with specialized
functionalities exploiting medical ontological information and UMLS medical
concepts to demonstrate different ways of displaying the retrieved results to
medical experts. Conclusions: Our results indicate that a specialized search
engine can improve the diagnostic quality without compromising the ease of use
of the currently widely popular web search engines. The proposed evaluation
approach can be valuable for future development and benchmarking. The FindZebra

thermohaline mixing is possible in low-mass red giants only if the horizontal
turbulence is very weak. In rotating stars the Rayleigh-Taylor and the shear

rotation laws of the form 1/r^(alpha) are predicted to be unstable for alpha >

naturally in systems where the coupling between the scattering channels is due

probabilistic component analysis techniques to a mere selection of the latent
neighbourhood, thus providing an elegant and principled framework for creating
novel component analysis models as well as constructing probabilistic
equivalents of deterministic component analysis methods. Under our framework,
we unify many very popular and well-studied component analysis algorithms, such
as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA),
Locality Preserving Projections (LPP) and Slow Feature Analysis (SFA), some of
which have no probabilistic equivalents in literature thus far. We firstly
define the Markov Random Fields (MRFs) which encapsulate the latent
connectivity of the aforementioned component analysis techniques; subsequently,
we show that the projection directions produced by all PCA, LDA, LPP and SFA
are also produced by the Maximum Likelihood (ML) solution of a single joint
probability density function, composed by selecting one of the defined MRF
priors while utilising a simple observation model. Furthermore, we propose
novel Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithms, exploiting the proposed joint
PDF, while we generalize the proposed methodologies to arbitrary connectivities
via parameterizable MRF products. Theoretical analysis and experiments on both

waves, and it requires only one parameter -- the diffusion constant. For waves,
however, diffusion is an approximation that disregards the possibility of
interference. Anderson localization, which manifests itself through a vanishing
diffusion coefficient in an infinite system, originates from constructive
interference of waves traveling in loop trajectories -- pairs of time-reversed
paths returning to the same point. In an open system of finite size, the return
probability through such paths is reduced, particularly near the boundary where
waves may escape. Based on this argument, the self-consistent theory of
localization and the supersymmetric field theory predict that the diffusion
coefficient varies spatially inside the system. A direct experimental
observation of this effect is a challenge because it requires monitoring wave
transport inside the system. Here, we fabricate two-dimensional photonic random
media and probe position-dependent diffusion inside the sample from the third
dimension. By varying the geometry of the system or the dissipation which also
limits the size of loop trajectories, we are able to control the
renormalization of the diffusion coefficient. This work shows the possibility
of manipulating diffusion via the interplay of localization and dissipation.

infections, information, or other quantities may spread. Although the standard
approach has been to aggregate all links into a static structure, some studies
suggest that the time order in which the links are established may alter the
dynamics of spreading. In this paper, we study the impact of the time ordering
in the limits of flow on various empirical temporal networks. By using a random
walk dynamics, we estimate the flow on links and convert the original
undirected network (temporal and static) into a directed flow network. We then
introduce the concept of flow motifs and quantify the divergence in the
representativity of motifs when using the temporal and static frameworks. We
find that the regularity of contacts and persistence of vertices (common in
email communication and face-to-face interactions) result on little differences
in the limits of flow for both frameworks. On the other hand, in the case of
communication within a dating site (and of a sexual network), the flow between
vertices changes significantly in the temporal framework such that the static
approximation poorly represents the structure of contacts. We have also
observed that cliques with 3 and 4 vertices con- taining only low-flow links
are more represented than the same cliques with all high-flow links. The
representativity of these low-flow cliques is higher in the temporal framework.
Our results suggest that the flow between vertices connected in cliques depend
on the topological context in which they are placed and in the time sequence in
which the links are established. The structure of the clique alone does not
completely characterize the potential of flow between the vertices.

time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). The pump-probe measurements
are numerically simulated by solving the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equation with
the pump and probe fields included as external fields. As expected, the excited
silicon shows features of a particle-hole plasma in its response. We compare
the calculated response with a thermal model and with a simple Drude model. The
thermal model requires only a static DFT calculation to prepare electronically
excited matter and agrees rather well with the TDDFT for the same particle-hole
density. The Drude model with two fitted parameters (electron effective mass
and collision time) also shows fair agreement at the lower excitation energies;
the fitted effective masses are consistent with carrier-band dispersions. The
extracted Drude lifetimes range from 6 fs at weak pumping fields to much lower
values at high fields. However, we find that the Drude model does not give a
good fit to the imaginary dielectric function at the highest fields. Comparing
the thermal model with the Drude, we find that the extracted lifetimes are in
the same range, 1-13 fs depending on the temperature. These short Drude
lifetimes show that strong damping is possible in the TDDFT, despite the
absence of electron scattering. One significant difference between the TDDFT
response and the other models is that the response to the probe pulse depends
on the polarization of the pump pulse. We also find that the imaginary part of
the dielectric function can be negative, particularly for the parallel
polarization of pump and probe fields.

robust in the sense that a small error in a remainder may cause a large error
in the reconstruction solution. A robust CRT was recently proposed for a
special case when the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all the moduli is more
than 1 and the remaining integers factorized by the gcd of all the moduli are
co-prime. In this special case, a closed-form reconstruction from erroneous
remainders was proposed and a necessary and sufficient condition on the
remainder errors was obtained. It basically says that the reconstruction error
is upper bounded by the remainder error level $\tau$ if $\tau$ is smaller than
a quarter of the gcd of all the moduli. In this paper, we consider the robust
reconstruction problem for a general set of moduli. We first present a
necessary and sufficient condition for the remainder errors for a robust
reconstruction from erroneous remainders with a general set of muduli and also
a corresponding robust reconstruction method. This can be thought of as a
single stage robust CRT. We then propose a two-stage robust CRT by grouping the
moduli into several groups as follows. First, the single stage robust CRT is
applied to each group. Then, with these robust reconstructions from all the
groups, the single stage robust CRT is applied again across the groups. This is
then easily generalized to multi-stage robust CRT. Interestingly, with this
two-stage robust CRT, the robust reconstruction holds even when the remainder
error level $\tau$ is above the quarter of the gcd of all the moduli. In this
paper, we also propose an algorithm on how to group a set of moduli for a
better reconstruction robustness of the two-stage robust CRT in some special

maps parametrized by a cell complex. We develop cellular (co)sheaves as a new
tool for topological data analysis, network coding and sensor networks. A
foundation for multi-dimensional level-set persistent homology is laid via
constructible cosheaves, which are equivalent to representations of
MacPherson's entrance path category. By proving a van Kampen theorem, we give a
direct proof of this equivalence. A cosheaf version of the i'th derived
pushforward of the constant sheaf along a definable map is constructed directly
as a representation of this category. We go on to clarify the relationship of
cellular sheaves to cosheaves by providing a formula that defines a derived
equivalence, which in turn recovers Verdier duality. Compactly-supported sheaf
cohomology is expressed as the coend with the image of the constant sheaf
through this equivalence. The equivalence is further used to establish
relations between sheaf cohomology and a herein newly introduced theory of
cellular sheaf homology. Inspired to provide fast algorithms for persistence,
we prove that the derived category of cellular sheaves over a 1D cell complex
is equivalent to a category of graded sheaves. Finally, we introduce the
interleaving distance as an extended pseudo-metric on the category of sheaves.
We prove that global sections partition the space of sheaves into connected
components. We conclude with an investigation into the geometry of the space of
constructible sheaves over the real line, which we relate to the bottleneck

several classifiers over a large set of unlabeled test data, is it possible to
a) reliably rank them; and b) construct a meta-classifier more accurate than
most classifiers in the ensemble? Here we present a novel spectral approach to

classifiers, we show that the off-diagonal entries of their covariance matrix
correspond to a rank-one matrix. Moreover, the classifiers can be ranked using
the leading eigenvector of this covariance matrix, as its entries are
proportional to their balanced accuracies. Second, via a linear approximation
to the maximum likelihood estimator, we derive the Spectral Meta-Learner (SML),
a novel ensemble classifier whose weights are equal to this eigenvector
entries. On both simulated and real data, SML typically achieves a higher
accuracy than most classifiers in the ensemble and can provide a better
starting point than majority voting, for estimating the maximum likelihood
solution. Furthermore, SML is robust to the presence of small malicious groups
of classifiers designed to veer the ensemble prediction away from the (unknown)

of a perfect fluid, which will be true with good accuracy in almost all the
situations of interest, and that the magnetic field configuration there is
force-free, which is likely to be a good approximation. We then apply this
relation to the stars which have direct LIGO/Virgo bounds on their m = 2

resulting force fields have no reason to be smooth and differentiable. The
release of the differentiability hypothesis has important mathematical
consequences, like scale dependence and the use of a higher algebra. The law of
mechanics transfers directly these properties to the velocity of fluid
particles whose trajectories in velocity space become fractal and
non-deterministic. The principle of relativity is used to find the form of the
equation governing velocity in scale space. The solution of this equation
contains a fractal and a non-fractal term. The fractal part is shown to be
equivalent to the Lagrangian version of the Kolmogorov law of fully-developed
and isotropic turbulence. It is therefore associated with turbulence, whereas
the non-fractal deterministic term is associated with a laminar behavior. These
terms are found to be balanced when the typical velocity reaches a level at
which the Reynolds number is equal to one, in agreement with the empirical
observations. The rate of energy dissipated by turbulence in a flow passing an
obstacle that was only known from experiments can be derived theoretically from
the equation's solution. Finally, a quantum-like equation in velocity space is
proposed in order to find the probability of having a given velocity at a given
location. It may eventually explain the presence of large scale coherent
structures in geophysical turbulent flows, like jet-streams.

converges to the values found for the isolated $\{Fe_4\}$ SMM. We compare these

the diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) with a
large viewing angle with respect to the line-of-sight (l.o.s.) has demonstrated
that this faint but numerous population is also expected to contribute
significantly to the total IGRB intensity. A more exotic contribution to the
IGRB invokes the pair annihilation of dark matter (DM) weakly interacting
massive particles (WIMPs) into $\gamma$-rays. In this work, we evaluate the
room left for galactic DM at high latitudes ($>10^\circ$) by including photons
from both prompt emission and inverse Compton scattering, emphasizing the
impact of the newly discovered contribution from misaligned AGN (MAGN) for such
an analysis. Summing up all significant galactic and extragalactic components
of the IGRB, we find that an improved understanding of the associated
astrophysical uncertainties is still mandatory to put stringent bounds on
thermally produced DM. On the other hand, we also demonstrate that the IGRB has
the potential to be one of the most competitive {\it future} ways to test the
DM WIMP hypothesis, once the present uncertainties are even slightly reduced.
In fact, if MAGN contribute even at 90% of the maximal level consistent with
our current understanding, thermally produced WIMPs would be severely
constrained as DM candidates for masses up to several TeV.

perturbatively. We systematically outline the corresponding perturbative
expansion, which can be thought of as an expansion in the ratio of fluid

Ir2O4 and Na4Ir3O8 respectively. The Kitaev spin liquid exact solution does not
generalize to these lattices. However, a different exactly soluble point of the
honeycomb lattice KH model, obtained by a four-sublattice transformation to a
ferromagnet, generalizes to all these lattices. A Klein four-group =Z2xZ2
structure is associated with this mapping (hence Klein duality). A finite
lattice admits the duality if a simple geometrical condition is met. This
duality predicts fluctuation free ordered states on these different 2D and 3D
lattices, which are analogs of the honeycomb lattice KH stripy order. This
result is used in conjunction with a semiclassical Luttinger-Tisza
approximation to obtain phase diagrams for KH models on the different lattices.
We also discuss a Majorana fermion based mean field theory at the Kitaev point,
which is exact on the honeycomb lattice, for the KH models on the different

mysterious. Its discoverers proposed that these ""sunquakes"" are the signature
of a shock driven by ""thick-target heating"" of the flaring chromosphere.
H-{\alpha} observations show evidence for such a shock. However, simulations of
shocks driven by impulsive chromospheric heating show withering radiative
losses as the shock proceeds downward. The compression of the shocked gas heats
and increases its density, making it more radiative. So, radiative losses
increase radically with the strength of the shock. This has introduced doubt
that sufficient energy from such a shock can penetrate into the solar interior
to match that indicated by the helioseismic signatures. We point out that
simulations of acoustic transients driven by impulsive heating have no account
for magnetic fields characteristic of transient-seismic-source environments.
These must have a major impact on the seismic flux conducted into the solar
interior. A strong horizontal magnetic field, for example, greatly increases
the compressional modulus of the chromospheric medium. This greatly reduces
compression of the gas, hence the radiative losses as the transient passes
through it. This could explain the strong affinity of seismic sources to
regions of strong, highly inclined penumbral magnetic fields. The role of
inclined magnetic fields, then, is fundamental to our understanding of the role
of impulsive heating in transient seismic emission.

with WMAP-7, results in $\gamma = 0.547 \pm 0.088$, consistent with the
prediction of General Relativity ($\gamma_{\rm GR} \approx 0.55$).
  The last chapter of this thesis studies the stellar-mass dependence of galaxy
clustering in the 6dF Galaxy Survey. Using the Halo Occupation Distribution
(HOD) model, this analysis investigates the trend of dark matter halo mass and
satellite fraction with stellar mass by measuring the projected correlation
function, $w_p(r_p)$. The findings of this analysis are, that the typical halo
mass ($M_1$) as well as the satellite power law index ($\alpha$) increase with
stellar mass. The 6dFGS results are compared to two different semi-analytic
models derived from the Millennium Simulation, as well as weak lensing
measurements.

extensions of Kitaev's spinless model of a 1D p-wave superconductor: those
involving (i) longer range hopping and superconductivity and (ii) inhomogeneous
potentials. We commence with a pedagogical review of the spinless model and, as
a means of characterizing topological phases exhibited by the systems studied
here, we introduce bulk topological invariants as well as those derived from an
explicit consideration of boundary modes. In time-reversal invariant systems,
we find that the longer range hopping leads to topological phases characterized
by multiple Majorana modes. In particular, we investigate a spin model, which
respects a duality and maps to a fermionic model with multiple Majorana modes;
we highlight the connection between these topological phases and the broken
symmetry phases in the original spin model. In the presence of time-reversal
symmetry breaking terms, we show that the topological phase diagram is
characterized by an extended gapless regime. For the case of inhomogeneous
potentials, we explore phase diagrams of periodic, quasiperiodic, and
disordered systems. We present a detailed mapping between normal state
localization properties of such systems and the topological phases of the
corresponding superconducting systems. This powerful tool allows us to leverage
the analyses of Hofstadter's butterfly and the vast literature on Anderson
localization to the question of Majorana modes in superconducting quasiperiodic
and disordered systems, respectively. We briefly touch upon the synergistic
effects that can be expected in cases where long-range hopping and disorder are
both present.

ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) were being developed for decades, the
interest in the radio detection diminished after the initial experiments in the
1960s. As a result, the fluorescence and the surface array techniques are more
mature today, providing more reliable measurements of the primary cosmic
particle energy, chemical composition and the inelastic cross-section. The
advantages of the radio technique are 100 percent duty cycle and lower
deployment and operational costs. Thus, the radio technique can greatly
complement the fluorescence and the ground array detection and can also work
independently. With the ANITA balloon detector observing UHECRs and the success
of LOPES, CODALEMA and other surface radio detectors, the radio technique
received a significant boost in recent years. Reliable Monte Carlo (MC)
simulations are needed in order to obtain the energy and other parameters of
the primary cosmic ray particle from the radio observations. Several MC
techniques, like ZHairesS and the Endpoint Formalism, were proposed in recent
years. While they seem to reproduce some of the observed data quite well, there
is a divergence between the different approaches under certain conditions. In
this work we derive these approaches from Maxwells equations and prove their
identity under certain conditions as well as discuss their applicability to the
UHECR air showers and to a proposed experiment at SLAC.

reduct. Many methods for the judgement of attribute characters are based on the
relationship between the objects and attributes. In this paper, a new type of
judgement theorems which are absolutely based on the relationship among
attributes is proposed for the judgement of attribute characters. The method is
through comparing the two new attribute sets $E(a)$ and $N(a)$ with respect to
the designated attribute $a$ which is proposed in this paper. We conclude that
which type of the attribute $a$ belongs to is determined by the relationship
between $E(a)$ and $N(a)$ in essence. Secondly, more concise and clear results
are given about the judgment of the attribute characters through analyzing the
properties of refinement and precise-refinement between $E(a)$ and $N(a)$ in
topology. In addition, the relationship among attributes are discussed which is
useful for constructing a reduct in the last section of this paper. In the

magnetic reconnection is a fundamental question for solar flares. We report
analysis of an M7.7 flare on 2012 July 19 observed by SDO/AIA and RHESSI.
Bi-directional outflows in forms of plasmoid ejections and contracting
cusp-shaped loops originate between an erupting flux rope and underlying flare
loops at speeds of typically 200-300 km/s up to 1050 km/s. These outflows are
associated with spatially separated double coronal X-ray sources with centroid
separation decreasing with energy. The highest temperature is located near the
nonthermal X-ray loop-top source well below the original heights of contracting
cusps near the inferred reconnection site. These observations suggest that the
primary loci of particle acceleration and plasma heating are in the
reconnection outflow regions, rather than the reconnection site itself. In
addition, there is an initial ascent of the X-ray and EUV loop-top source prior
to its recently recognized descent, which we ascribe to the interplay among
multiple processes including the upward development of reconnection and the
downward contractions of reconnected loops. The impulsive phase onset is
delayed by 10 minutes from the start of the descent, but coincides with the
rapid speed increases of the upward plasmoids, the individual loop shrinkages,
and the overall loop-top descent, suggestive of an intimate relation of the
energy release rate and reconnection outflow speed.

alternating vowel-consonant (VCVC) words; words with at least one repeated

three-dimensional, leading to metallicity both in NiB (PtB) and the intervening
LaN layers. Our ab initio phonon calculations show that almost all phonon modes
contribute to the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) mechanism, reflecting that
both layers are involved in the superconductivity. For LaNiBN, we obtain an EPC
strength of \lambda = 0.52 and a logarithmically averaged characteristic phonon
frequency of \omega_{log} = 376 K, leading to T_c = 3.9 K. Compared with the Ni
B_{1g} mode in LaNiBN, the Pt B_{1g} mode in LaPtBN is reduced by ~70%, leading
to a slightly enhanced \lambda = 0.56 and an ~20 % reduced \omega_{log}. The
estimated T_c is 5.4 K for LaPtBN, in good agreement with the experiment. We do
not find any indication of magnetic instability for either LaNiBN or LaPtBN,
which implies that both systems are EPC mediated superconductors. Further, we
have found an interesting trend of monotonic increase of T_c with respect to
the boron height in the NiB (PtB) layer of both borocarbide and boronitride
superconductors, which suggests a possible way to enhance T_c in these systems.

there exists an infinite $H$ with $|f([H]^r)| \leq d$. The second and third are
the Free Set Theorem and the Thin Set Theorem, which were introduced by Harvey
Friedman. And the last is the Rainbow Ramsey Theorem. We show that, most
theorems from these families are quite weak, i.e., they are strictly weaker
than $\operatorname{ACA}_0$ over $\operatorname{RCA}_0$. Interestingly, these
families turn out to be closely related. We establish the so-called strong cone
avoidance property of most instances of the Achromatic Ramsey Theorem by an
induction of exponents, then apply this and a similar induction to obtain the
strong cone avoidance property of the Free Set Theorem. From the strong cone
avoidance property of the Achromatic Ramsey Theorem and the Free Set Theorem,
we derive the strong cone property of the Thin Set Theorem and the Rainbow
Ramsey Theorem. It follws easily that a theorem with the strong cone avoidance
property does not imply $\operatorname{ACA}_0$ over $\operatorname{RCA}_0$.

SDSS images, and using the Gini coefficient and M_20. We derive oxygen and
nitrogen abundances using the T_e method. We find that a substantial fraction
of BCGs with disturbed morphologies, indicative of merger remnants, show
relatively high N/O and low O/H abundance ratios. The majority of the disturbed
BCGs exhibit higher N/O values at a given O/H value compared to the
morphologically undisturbed galaxies, implying more efficient nitrogen
enrichment in disturbed BCGs. We detect Wolf-Rayet (WR) features in only a
handful of the disturbed BCGs, which appears to contradict the idea that WR
stars are responsible for high nitrogen abundance. Combining these results with
Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) GR6 ultraviolet (UV) data, we find that the
majority of the disturbed BCGs show systematically lower values of the H alpha
to near-UV star formation rate ratio. The equivalent width of the H beta
emission line is also systematically lower in the disturbed BCGs. Based on
these results, we infer that disturbed BCGs have undergone star formation over
relatively longer time scales, resulting in a more continuous enrichment of
nitrogen. We suggest that this correlation between morphology and chemical
abundances in BCGs is due to a difference in their recent star formation
histories.

Jupiter-like planets in Jupiter-like orbits. For long-term radial-velocity
monitoring, it is useful to estimate the observational effort required to
reliably detect such objects, particularly in light of severe competition for
limited telescope time. We perform detailed simulations of observational
campaigns, maximizing the realism of the sampling of a set of simulated
observations. We then compute the detection limits for each campaign to
quantify the effect of increasing the number of observational epochs and
varying their time coverage. We show that once there is sufficient time
baseline to detect a given orbital period, it becomes less effective to add
further time coverage -- rather, the detectability of a planet scales roughly
as the square root of the number of observations, independently of the number
of orbital cycles included in the data string. We also show that no noise floor
is reached, with a continuing improvement in detectability at the maximum
number of observations N=500 tested here.

  Rotational spectral line signatures of CO, HCO+, CS, HCN and HNC from a
490-1240 GHz survey with Herschel/HIFI, complemented by ground-based JCMT and
IRAM 30m spectra, cover transitions with E(up)/k between 5 and ~300 K (750K for
12C16O, using selected frequency settings up to 1850 GHz). The resolved
spectral line profiles are used to separate and study various kinematic
components.
  The line profiles show two emission components, the widest and bluest of
which is attributed to an approaching outflow and the other to the envelope. We
find evidence for progressively more redshifted and wider line profiles from
the envelope gas with increasing energy level, qualitatively explained by
residual outflow contribution picked up in the systematically decreasing beam
size. Integrated line intensities for each species decrease as E(up)/k
increases from <50 to 700K. We constrain the following: n(H2)~10^5-10^6 cm^-3
and T~60-200K for the outflow gas; T=9-17K and N(H2)~3x10^21 cm^-2 for a known
foreground absorption cloud; N(H2)<10^19 cm^-2 for a second foreground
component.
  Our spherical envelope radiative transfer model systematically underproduces
observed line emission at E(up)/k > 150 K for all species. This indicates that
warm gas should be added to the model and that the model's geometry should
provide low optical depth pathways for line emission from this warm gas to
escape, for example in the form of UV heated outflow cavity walls viewed at a
favorable inclination angle. Physical and chemical conditions derived for the
outflow gas are similar to those in the protostellar envelope, possibly
indicating that the modest velocity (<10 km/s) outflow component consists of
recently swept-up gas.

preserved when the perturbation decays more rapidly than a critical rate. At
the critical rate, the convergence to equilibrium is slightly slower than the
unperturbed equation, and when the perturbation decays more slowly than the
critical rate, the convergence to equilibrium is strictly slower than that seen
in the unperturbed equation. In the last case, under strengthened assumptions,
a new convergence rate is recorded which depends on the convergence rate of the
perturbation. The latter result relies on the function being regularly varying
at the equilibrium with index greater than unity; therefore, for this class of
regularly varying problems, a classification of the convergence rates is
obtained.

these models have four particle vertices, e.g. qqXX, leading to the pair

an increasing rate of specific star formation. The Hubble sequence also follows
a banana-shaped correlation between 24 and 70 micron luminosities, both
normalized with the K-band luminosity. We show that this correlation is
significantly tightened if galaxies with central AGN emission are removed, but
the cosmic scatter of elliptical galaxies in both 24 and 70 micron luminosities
remains significant along the correlation. We find that the 24 micron variation
among ellipticals correlates with stellar metallicity, reflecting emission from
hot dust in winds from asymptotic giant branch stars of varying metallicity.
Infrared surface brightness variations in elliptical galaxies indicate that the
K - 24 color profile is U-shaped for reasons that are unclear. In some
elliptical galaxies cold interstellar dust emitting at 70 and 160 microns may
arise from recent gas-rich mergers. However, we argue that most of the large
range of 70 micron luminosity in elliptical galaxies is due to dust transported
from galactic cores by feedback events in (currently IR-quiet) active galactic
nuclei. Cooler dusty gas naturally accumulates in the cores of elliptical
galaxies due to dust-cooled local stellar mass loss and may accrete onto the
central black hole, releasing energy. AGN-heated gas can transport dust in
cores 5-10 kpc out into the hot gas atmospheres where it radiates extended 70
micron emission but is eventually destroyed by sputtering. This, and some
modest star formation, defines a cycle of dust creation and destruction.
Elliptical galaxies evidently undergo large transient excursions in the banana
plot in times comparable to the sputtering time or AGN duty cycle, 10 Myrs.
Normally regarded as passive, elliptical galaxies are the most active galaxies

grow to form aggregates. As these aggregates grow by coagulation, their filling
factor \phi decreases down to \phi << 1. However, comets, the remnants of these
early planetesimals, have \phi ~ 0.1. Thus, static compression of porous dust
aggregates is important in planetesimal formation. However, the static
compression strength has been investigated only for relatively high density
aggregates (\phi > 0.1). Aims: We investigate and find the compression strength
of highly porous aggregates (\phi << 1). Methods: We perform three dimensional
N-body simulations of aggregate compression with a particle-particle
interaction model. We introduce a new method of static compression: the
periodic boundary condition is adopted and the boundaries move with low speed
to get closer. The dust aggregate is compressed uniformly and isotropically by
themselves over the periodic boundaries. Results: We empirically derive a
formula of the compression strength of highly porous aggregates (\phi << 1). We
check the validity of the compression strength formula for wide ranges of
numerical parameters, such as the size of initial aggregates, the boundary
speed, the normal damping force, and material. We also compare our results to
the previous studies of static compression in the relatively high density
region (\phi > 0.1) and confirm that our results consistently connect to those
in the high density region. The compression strength formula is also derived
analytically.

benefits of detecting vacuum excited SPPs, as opposed to DCE photons, are that
parametric enhancement does not require a sealed cavity in the axial direction

techniques. For the case of constant permeability, $\mu$, TM branch SPPs and

M_\nu's are exactly predicted in terms of the experimentally determined

explanation for one such feature, observed in experiments by Casner and
Delville [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 90}, 144503 (2003)], namely the sudden
formation of ""shoulder""-like shapes in a laser-induced deformation of the
liquid-liquid interface at high laser power. Two candidate explanations are the
following: firstly, that the shape can be explained by balancing forces of
buoyancy, laser pull and surface tension only, and that the observed change of
deformation shape is the sudden jump from one solution of the strongly
nonlinear governing differential equation to another. Secondly, it might be
that the nontrivial shape observed could be the result of temperature gradients
due to local absorptive heating of the liquid. We report that a systematic
search for solutions of the governing equation in the first case yields no
trace of solutions containing such features. By contrast, an investigation of
the second option shows that the narrow shape of the tip of the deformation can
be explained by a slight {\it heating} of the liquids. The local heating
amounts to a few kelvins, with the parameters given, although there are
uncertainties here. Our investigations suggest that local temperature
variations are the crucial element behind the instability and the shoulder-like
deformation.

data-sets, the power of arc statistics as a cosmological tool has been only
minimally exploited so far. On the other hand, the last years were
characterized by significant advancements in the field, and several cluster
surveys that are ongoing or planned for the near future seem to have the
potential to make arc statistics a competitive cosmological probe.
Additionally, recent observations of anomalously large Einstein radii and
concentrations in galaxy clusters have reinvigorated the debate on the arc
statistics problem. In this paper, we review the work done so far on arc
statistics, focussing on what is the lesson we learned and what is likely to
improve in the next years.

subdwarfs (sdB) have been carried out for more than a decade now. These
analyses rely on stellar models whose reliability for the required task needs
to be evaluated critically. Aims. We present new models of the so-called third
generation (3G) dedicated to the asteroseismology of sdB stars. These
parameterized models are complete static structures suitable for analyzing both
p- and g-mode pulsators, contrary to the former second generation (2G) models
that were limited to p-modes. While the reliability of the 2G models has been
successfully verified in the past, this important test still has to be
conducted on the 3G structures. Methods. The close eclipsing binary PG 1336-018
provides a unique opportunity to test the reliability of sdB models. We
compared the structural parameters of the sdB component in PG 1336-018 obtained
from asteroseismology based on the 3G models, with those derived independently
from the modeling of the reflection/irradiation effect and the eclipses
observed in the light curve. Results. The stellar parameters inferred from
asteroseismology using the 3G models are found to be remarkably consistent with
both the preferred orbital solution obtained from the binary light curve
modeling and the updated spectroscopic estimates for the surface gravity of the
star. We also show that the uncertainties on the input physics included in
stellar models have no noticeable impact, at the current level of accuracy, on
the structural parameters derived by asteroseismology. Conclusions. The stellar
models presently used to carry out quantitative seismic analyses of sdB stars
are reliable for the task. The stellar parameters inferred by this technique,
at least for those that could be tested (M*, R*, and log g), appear to be both
very precise and accurate, as no significant systematic effect has been found.

is known about the kinetics of this classic system. Filling this gap in our
understanding has new urgency because DNA nanotechnology often depends
critically on binding rates. Here we use a coarse-grained model to explore the
hybridization kinetics of DNA oligomers, finding that strand association
proceeds through a complex set of intermediate states. Successful binding
events start with the formation of a few metastable base-pairing interactions,
followed by zippering of the remaining bonds. However, despite reasonably
strong interstrand interactions, initial contacts frequently fail to lead to
zippering because the typical configurations in which they form differ from
typical states of similar enthalpy in the double-stranded equilibrium ensemble.
Therefore, if the association process is analyzed on the base-pair (secondary
structure) level, it shows non-Markovian behavior. Initial contacts must be
stabilized by two or three base pairs before full zippering is likely,
resulting in negative effective activation enthalpies. Non-Arrhenius behavior
is observed as the number of base pairs in the effective transition state
increases with temperature. In addition, we find that alternative pathways
involving misbonds can increase association rates. For repetitive sequences,
misaligned duplexes frequently rearrange to form fully paired duplexes by two
distinct processes which we label `pseudoknot' and `inchworm' internal
displacement. We show how the above processes can explain why experimentally
observed association rates of GC-rich oligomers are higher than rates of
AT-rich equivalents. More generally, we argue that association rates can be
modulated by sequence choice.

effects introduced by our reliance on X-ray and SZ selected reference cluster

Compared to other SDSS photometric cluster catalogs, redMaPPer has the highest

some algorithms do achieve comparable performance to redMaPPer in subsets of
the above categories and/or in limited redshift ranges. The redMaPPer richness
is clearly the one that best correlates with X-ray temperature and gas mass.

features of these abundances remain unexplained and challenge the understanding
of core-collapse supernovae explosions and nucleosynthesis. We show, for the
first time, that most of the measured C-rich grain abundances can be accounted
for in the C-rich material from explosive He burning in core-collapse
supernovae with high shock velocities and consequent high temperatures. The
inefficiency of the $^{12}$C($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{16}$O reaction relative to
the rest of the $\alpha$-capture chain at $T > 3.5\times10^8 \mathrm{K}$ causes
the deepest He-shell material to be carbon rich and silicon rich, and depleted
in oxygen. The isotopic ratio predictions in part of this material, defined
here as the C/Si zone, are in agreement with the grain data. The
high-temperature explosive conditions that our models reach at the bottom of
the He shell, can also be representative of the nucleosynthesis in hypernovae
or in the high-temperature tail of a distribution of conditions in asymmetric
supernovae. Finally, our predictions are consistent with the observation of
large $^{44}$Ca/$^{40}$Ca observed in the grains. This is due to the production
of $^{44}$Ti together with $^{40}$Ca in the C/Si zone, and/or to the strong

absence of the normally conspicuous core emission of the Mg2 h&k resonance

which would be unprecedented for a solar-like star of the imputed age of
WASP-12; or (2) extrinsic absorption, from the intervening interstellar medium
(ISM) or from material within the WASP-12 system itself, presumably ablated
from the extreme hot Jupiter WASP-12b. HIRES archival spectra of the Ca2 H&K
lines of WASP-12 show broad depressions in the line cores, deeper than those of
other inactive and similarly distant stars and similar to WASP-12's Mg2 h&k
line profiles. We took high resolution ESPADONS and FIES spectra of three
early-type stars within 20' of WASP-12 and at similar distances, which show the
ISM column is insufficient to produce the broad Ca2 depression observed in
WASP-12. The EBHIS H1 column density map supports and strengthens this
conclusion. Extrinsic absorption by material local to the WASP-12 system is
therefore the most likely cause of the line core anomalies. Gas escaping from
the heavily irradiated planet could form a stable and thick circumstellar
disk/cloud. The anomalously low stellar activity index (logR'HK) of WASP-12 is
evidently a direct consequence of the extra core absorption, so similar HK
index deficiencies might signal the presence of translucent circumstellar gas
around other stars hosting evaporating planets.

the fiber collision in the galaxy survey influences the one-halo term and the
higher multipole spectra, because the number of satellite galaxies in the halo

electrostatic forces on the actuation dynamics of micro-electromechanical
systems (MEMS). In contrast with the expectations, roughness can influence MEMS
dynamics even at distances between bodies significantly larger than the
root-mean-square roughness. This effect is associated with statistically rare
high asperities that can be locally close to the point of contact. It is found
that, even though surface roughness appears to have a detrimental effect on the
availability of stable equilibria, it ensures that those equilibria can be
reached more easily than in the case of flat surfaces. Hence our findings play
a principal role for the stability of microdevices such as vibration sensors,
switches, and other related MEM architectures operating at distances below 100

  statistical challenges",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background. With the increasing interest in post-GWAS research which
represents a transition from genome-wide association discovery to analysis of
functional mechanisms, attention has been lately focused on the potential of
including various biological material in epidemiological studies. In
particular, exploration of the carcinogenic process through transcriptional
analysis at the epidemiological level opens up new horizons in functional
analysis and causal inference, and requires a new design together with adequate
analysis procedures.
  Results. In this article, we present the post-genome design implemented in
the NOWAC cohort as an example of a prospective nested case-control study built
for transcriptomics use, and discuss analytical strategies to explore the
changes occurring in transcriptomics during the carcinogenic process in
association with questionnaire information. We emphasize the inadequacy of
survival analysis models usually considered in GWAS for post-genome design, and
propose instead to parameterize the gene trajectories during the carcinogenic
process.
  Conclusions. This novel approach, in which transcriptomics are considered as
potential intermediate biomarkers of cancer and exposures, offers a flexible
framework which can include various biological assumptions.

formation where the gravitational potential of the black hole dominates. In

become gravitationally unstable near Sgr A*. Alternatively, collisions between

particle accelerator and the resultant gamma-ray emission. By considering the
condition for the accelerator to be self-sustained, we derive how the
trans-magnetic-field thickness of the accelerator evolves with the pulsar age.
It is found that the thickness is small but increases steadily if the
neutron-star envelope is contaminated by sufficient light elements. For such a
light element envelope, the gamma-ray luminosity of the accelerator is kept
approximately constant as a function of age in the initial ten thousand years,
forming the lower bound of the observed distribution of the gamma-ray
luminosity of rotation-powered pulsars. If the envelope consists of only heavy
elements, on the other hand, the thickness is greater but increases less
rapidly than what a light element envelope has. For such a heavy element
envelope, the gamma-ray luminosity decreases relatively rapidly, forming the
upper bound of the observed distribution. The gamma-ray luminosity of a general
pulsar resides between these two extreme cases, reflecting the envelope
composition and the magnetic inclination angle with respect to the rotation
axis.

replacing the nonlinear element of an ordinary MLC circuit, namely the Chua's
diode, with a three segment piecewise linear active flux controlled memristor.
The bistability nature of the memristor introduces two discontinuty boundaries
or switching manifolds in the circuit topology. As a result, the circuit
becomes a piecewise smooth system of second order. Grazing bifurcations, which
are essentially a form of discontinuity induced non-smooth bifurcations, occur
at these boundaries and govern the dynamics of the circuit. While the
interaction of the memristor aided self oscillations of the circuit and the
external sinusoidal forcing result in the phenomenon of beats occurring in the
circuit, grazing bifurcations endow them with chaotic and hyper chaotic nature.
In addition the circuit admits a codimension-5 bifurcation and transient hyper
chaos. Grazing bifurcations as well as other behaviors have been analyzed
numerically using time series plots, phase portraits, bifurcation diagram,
power spectra and Lyapunov spectrum, as well as the recent 0-1 K test for
chaos, obtained after constructing a proper Zero Time Discontinuity Map (ZDM)

study coronal loops at small scales, emerging in the quiet Sun. With HMI
line-of-sight magnetograms, we derive the integrated and unsigned photospheric
magnetic flux at the loop footpoints in the photosphere. These loops are bright
in the EUV channels of AIA. Using the six AIA EUV filters, we construct the
differential emission measure (DEM) in the temperature range $5.7 - 6.5$ in log
$T$ (K) for several hours of observations. The observed DEMs have a peak
distribution around log $T \approx$ 6.3, falling rapidly at higher
temperatures. For log $T <$ 6.3, DEMs are comparable to their peak values
within an order of magnitude. The emission weighted temperature is calculated,
and its time variations are compared with those of magnetic flux. We present
two possibilities for explaining the observed DEMs and temperatures variations.
(a) Assuming the observed loops are comprised of hundred thin strands with
certain radius and length, we tested three time-dependent heating models and
compared the resulting DEMs and temperatures with the observed quantities. This
modeling used Enthalpy-based Thermal Evolution of Loops (EBTEL), a
zero-dimensional (0D) hydrodynamic code. The comparisons suggest that a medium
frequency heating model with a population of different heating amplitudes can
roughly reproduce the observations. (b) We also consider a loop model with
steady heating and non-uniform cross-section of the loop along its length, and
find that this model can also reproduce the observed DEMs, provided the loop
expansion factor $\gamma \sim$ 5 - 10. More observational constraints are
required to better understand the nature of coronal heating in the short
emerging loops on the quiet Sun.

using archival data. We generate multi-band long term light curves of these
sources, build their spectral energy distribution (SED) and model them using an
one zone leptonic model. They resemble more to the SEDs of the flat spectrum
radio quasar (FSRQ) class of AGN. We then compare the SEDs of these two sources
with two other Fermi detected AGN along the traditional blazar sequence, namely
the BL Lac Mrk 421 (z = 0.03) and the FSRQ 3C 454.3 (z = 0.86). The SEDs of
both PKS 1502+036 and PKS 2004-447 are found to be intermediate to the SEDs of
Mrk 421 and 3C 454.3. In the gamma-ray spectral index v/s gamma-ray luminosity
plane, both these NLSy1 galaxies occupy a distinct position, wherein, they have
luminosity between Mrk 421 and 3C 454.3, however steep gamma-ray spectra
similar to 3C 454.3. Their Compton dominance as well as their X-ray spectral
slope also lie between Mrk 421 and 3C 454.3. We argue that the physical
properties of both PKS 1502+036 and PKS 2004$-$447 are in general similar to
blazars and intermediate between FSRQs and BL Lac objects and these sources
thus could fit into the traditional blazar sequence.

""projection postulate"" is that under continuous measurement, the state of a
system traces out a ""quantum trajectory"" in time that depends upon its
measurement record, and that in certain situations, the quantum state of a
system stochastically collapses at a finite rate toward a random eigenstate. On
the other hand, quantum theory also predicts that environmental coupling
produces the opposite effect of spreading the wave function into a mixed state.
Studying the effect of these two competing processes, as the ratio of their
strengths is varied, on the distribution of a quantum state is of fundamental
interest in any setting, but especially so in the mechanical realm. A key
issue, however, is that a fundamental study of such physics can not entail an a
priori assumption of the projection postulate itself, and Bayesian inference
may therefore not be employed to observe the quantum state. In this theoretical
work we propose a feasible way to perform such a fundamental test with a
mechanical wave function in the energy eigenbasis. The scheme is based on an
optomechanical setup wherein optical fields provide a direct probe of the
energy variance of the mechanical wave function. Such an energy variance probe
is unprecedented in any type of system. Numerical simulations that incorporate
the projection postulate predict a monotonic decrease in the time-averaged
energy variance as the ratio of continuous measurement strength to dissipation
is increased. The measurement strength in the proposed scheme is tunable in
situ, and the behavior predicted by the simulations therefore implies that the
scheme amounts to a way to verifiably control in situ the time-averaged
variance of a mechanical wave function over the course of a single quantum
trajectory.

the control region, driven by the flow of an ODE, covers all the domain. The
proof is based upon the interpretation of the system as, roughly, the coupling
of a heat equation with an ordinary differential equation (ODE). The presence
of the ODE for which there is no propagation along the space variable makes the
controllability of the system impossible when the control is confined into a
subset in space that does not move. %Accordingly, we consider the control on a
moving support that, along the time interval, covers the whole domain. The null
controllability of the system with a moving control is established in using the
observability of the adjoint system and some Carleman estimates for a coupled
system of a parabolic equation and an ODE with the same singular weight,
adapted to the geometry of the moving support of the control. This extends to
the multi-dimensional case the results by P. Martin et al. on the
one-dimensional case, employing 1-d Fourier analysis techniques.

Abstract abridged for arXiv",,"10.1093/mnras/stt813",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present observations of the interacting transient SN 2009ip, from the
start of the outburst in October 2012 until the end of the 2012 observing
season. The transient reached a peak of $M_V$=-17.7 mag before fading rapidly,
with a total integrated luminosity of 1.9$\times10^{49}$ erg over the period of
August-December 2012. The optical and near infrared spectra are dominated by
narrow emission lines, signaling a dense circumstellar environment, together
with multiple components of broad emission and absorption in H and He at
velocities between 0.5-1.2$\times10^4$ km s$^{-1}$\. We see no evidence for
nucleosynthesized material in SN 2009ip, even in late-time pseudo-nebular
spectra. We set a limit of $<$0.02 M$_{\odot}$\ on the mass of any synthesized
$^{56}$Ni from the late time lightcurve. A simple model for the narrow Balmer
lines is presented, and used to derive number densities for the circumstellar
medium of between $\sim 10^{9}-10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$. Our near-infrared data does
not show any excess at longer wavelengths. Our last data, taken in December
2012, shows that SN 2009ip has spectroscopically evolved to something quite
similar to its appearance in late 2009, albeit with higher velocities. It is
possible that neither of the eruptive and high luminosity events of SN 2009ip
were induced by a core-collapse. We show that the peak and total integrated
luminosity can be due to the efficient conversion of kinetic energy from
colliding ejecta, and that around 0.05-0.1 M$_{\odot}$\ of material moving at
0.5-1$\times10^4$ km s$^{-1}$\ could comfortably produce the observed
luminosity. The ejection of multiple shells, lack of evidence for
nucleosynthesied elements and broad nebular lines, are all consistent with the
pulsational-pair instability scenario. In this case the progenitor star may
still exist, and will be observed after the current outburst fades.

optimal stopping problems for L\'evy processes. Instead of the usual method of
guess-and-verify based on martingale properties of the value function, we
suggest a more direct method by showing that the general theory of optimal
stopping for strong Markov processes together with some elementary observations
imply that the stopping set must be of a certain form for the optimal stopping
problems we consider. The independence of increments and the strong Markov
property of L\'evy processes then allow us to use straightforward optimisation
over a real-valued parameter to determine this stopping set. We illustrate this
approach by applying it to the McKean optimal stopping problem (American put),
the Novikov--Shiryaev optimal stopping problem and the Shepp--Shiryaev optimal
stopping problem (Russian option).

proposed hybrid design aim was to ensure that the two algorithms complement
each other by exploring and exploiting the problem search space. Preliminary
results justify that an adept hybridization of evolutionary algorithms with a
suitable local search method, could yield a robust and efficient means of
solving wide range of global optimization problems. Finally, a discussion of

amplitude (resonance) or phase shift to subthreshold oscillatory currents, but
the effect of biophysical parameters on these properties is not well
understood. We propose a general framework to analyze the role of different
ionic currents and their interactions in shaping the properties of impedance
amplitude and phase in linearized biophysical models and demonstrate this
approach in a two-dimensional linear model with two effective conductances gL
and g1. We compute the key attributes of impedance and phase (resonance
frequency and amplitude, zero-phase frequency, selectivity, etc.) in the gL-g1
parameter space. Using these attribute diagrams we identify two basic
mechanisms for the generation of resonance: an increase in the resonance
amplitude as g1 increases while the overall impedance is decreased, and an
increase in the maximal impedance, without any change in the input resistance,
as the ionic current time constant increases. We use the attribute diagrams to
analyze resonance and phase of the linearizations of two biophysical models
that include resonant (Ih or slow potassium) and amplifying currents
(persistent sodium). In the absence of amplifying currents, the two models
behave similarly as the conductances of the resonant currents is increased
whereas, with the amplifying current present, the two models have qualitatively
opposite responses. This work provides a general method for decoding the effect
of biophysical parameters on linear membrane resonance and phase by tracking
trajectories, parametrized by the relevant biophysical parameter, in
pre-constructed attribute diagrams.

Fermi energy. In the absence of disorder, the conductance shows sharp dips
(antiresonances) as a function of magnetic flux. We discuss different types of
disorder and find that the short-range disorder broadens antiresonances, while
the long-range one leads to arising of additional resonant dips. We demonstrate
that the resonant dips have essentially non-Lorentzian shape. The results are
generalized to account for the spin-orbit interaction which leads to splitting
of the disorder-broadened resonant dips, and consequently to coexisting of two
types of oscillations (both having the form of sharp dips): Aharonov-Bohm
oscillations with magnetic flux and Aharonov-Casher oscillations with the
strength of the spin-orbit coupling. We also discuss the effect of the Zeeman
coupling.

presented to improve curve offsetting quality for the break and

that the proposed approach can enhance the efficiency and quality for ruled

which sends any non-empty compact connected hv-convex planar set $K$ to the
associated generalized conic function $f_K$. The function $f_K$ measures the
average taxicab distance of the points in the plane from the focal set $K$ by
integration. The main area of the applications is the geometric tomography
because $f_K$ involves the coordinate X-rays' information as second order
partial derivatives \cite{NV3}. We prove that the Hausdorff-convergence implies
the convergence of the conic functions with respect to both the supremum-norm
and the $L_1$-norm provided that we restrict the domain to the collection of
non-empty compact connected hv-convex planar sets contained in a fixed box
(reference set) with parallel sides to the coordinate axes. We also have that
$\Phi^{-1}$ is upper semi-continuous as a set-valued mapping. The upper
semi-continuity establishes an approximating process in the sense that if $f_L$
is close to $f_K$ then $L$ must be close to an element $K'$ such that
$f_{K}=f_{K'}$. Therefore $K$ and $K'$ have the same coordinate X-rays almost
everywhere. Lower semi-continuity is usually related to the existence of
continuous selections. If a set-valued mapping is both upper and lower
semi-continuous at a point of its domain it is called continuous. The last
section of the paper is devoted to the case of non-empty compact convex planar
sets. We show that the class of convex bodies that are determined by their
coordinate X-rays coincides with the family of convex bodies $K$ for which
$f_K$ is a point of lower semi-continuity for $\Phi^{-1}$.

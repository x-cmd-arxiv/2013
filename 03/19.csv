emerge in strongly interacting bosonic systems and are classified in terms of
the cohomology of their symmetry groups. Here we provide a physical picture
that leads to an intuitive understanding and wavefunctions for several SPT
phases in d=1,2,3 dimensions. We consider symmetries which include a Z_2
subgroup, that allows us to define domain walls. While the usual disordered
phase is obtained by proliferating domain walls, we show that SPT phases are
realized when these proliferated domain walls are `decorated', i.e. are
themselves SPT phases in one lower dimension. For example a d=2 SPT phase with
Z_2 and time reversal symmetry is realized when the domain walls that
proliferate are themselves in a d=1 Haldane/AKLT state. Similarly, d=3 SPT
phases with Z_2 * Z_2 symmetry emerges when domain walls in a d=2 SPT with Z_2
symmetry are proliferated. The resulting ground states are shown to be
equivalent to that obtained from group cohomology and field theoretical
techniques. The result of gauging the Z_2 symmetry in these phases is also
discussed. An extension of this construction where time reversal plays the role
of Z_2 symmetry allows for a discussion of several d=3 SPT phases. This
construction also leads to a new perspective on some well known d=1 SPT phases,
from which exactly soluble parent Hamiltonians may be derived.

construct a template of the projected density distribution up to $z\simeq 0.7$
by using the Luminous Galaxies (LGs) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR8. We
use a photo-z catalogue trained with more than a hundred thousand galaxies from
BOSS in the SDSS DR8 imaging area. We consider two different LG samples whose
selection matches that of SDSS-III/BOSS: the LOWZ sample ($z\in [0.15,0.5]$)
and the CMASS sample ($z\in[0.4,0.7]$). When building the LG density maps we
use the information from star density, survey footprint, seeing conditions, sky
emission, dust extinction and airmass to explore the impact of these artifacts
on the two LG samples. In agreement with previous studies, we find that the
CMASS sample is particularly sensitive to Galactic stars, which dominate the
contribution to the auto-angular power spectrum below $\ell=7$. Other potential
systematics affect mostly the low multipole range ($\ell\in[2,7]$), but leave
fluctuations on smaller scales practically unchanged. The resulting power
spectra in the multipole range $\ell\in[2,100]$ for the LOWZ, CMASS and
LOWZ+CMASS samples are compatible with linear $\Lambda$CDM expectations and
constant bias values of $b=1.98 \pm 0.11$, $2.08\pm0.14$ and $1.88\pm 0.11$,
respectively, with no traces of non-Gaussianity: $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm local}=59\pm
75$ at 95% confidence level for the full LOWZ+CMASS sample in the range
$\ell\in[4,100]$. After cross-correlating WMAP-9yr data with the LOWZ+CMASS LG
density field, the ISW signal is detected at the level of 1.62--1.69$\,\sigma$.
While this result is in close agreement with predictions from Monte Carlo
simulations in the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model, it cannot rule out by itself
an Einstein-de Sitter scenario, and has a moderately low signal compared to
previous studies conducted on subsets of this LG sample.

the radio spectrum, we incorporate a multiphase interstellar medium in the
starburst region of M82. Our model interstellar medium is highly fragmented
with compact dense molecular clouds and dense photoionized gas, both embedded
in a hot, low density medium in overall pressure equilibrium. The spectra
predicted by this one-zone model are compared to the observed radio and
\gamma-ray spectra of M82. Chi-squared tests are used with radio and \gamma-ray
observations and a range of model predictions to find the best-fit parameters.
The best-fit model yields constraints on key parameters in the starburst zone

Among these sources, we classified for the first time three active galactic
nuclei (AGN) candidates. We derived X-ray luminosity functions of the X-ray
sources in M83 in the 2-10 keV energy range, within and outside the D_25
ellipse, correcting the total X-ray luminosity function for incompleteness and
subtracting the AGN contribution. The X-ray luminosity function inside the D_25
ellipse is consistent with that previously observed by Chandra. The
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test shows that the X-ray luminosity function of the outer
disc and the AGN luminosity distribution are uncorrelated with a probability of
about 99.3%. We also found that the X-ray sources detected outside the D_25

measurements of a sample of eleven of these galaxies at redshifts z<0.05. We
detect H I emission in six of the E+A galaxies. In combination with earlier
studies, the total number of E+A galaxies with measured cold gas components is
now eleven. Roughly half of the E+As studied so far have detectable HI. The gas
fractions of these galaxies, measured with respect to their stellar mass, are
between 1 and 10 percent and are at the high end of the gas fractions measured
in gas-bearing early type galaxies and typically lower than seen in late-type
galaxies with comparable stellar masses. This finding is consistent with the
idea that E+As are currently evolving from the blue cloud to the red sequence.
However, the question of why the star formation has ceased in these galaxies
while a significant gas reservoir is still present can only be answered by
higher spatial resolution observations of the cold gas.

with extrapolation of spectra from lower energies. Risaliti et al. have
recently attempted to model the hard X-ray excess in the type 1.8 AGN NGC 1365,
concluding that the hard excess most likely arises from Compton-scattered
reflection of X-rays from an inner accretion disk close to the black hole.
Their analysis disfavored a model in which the hard excess arises from a high
column density of circumnuclear gas partially covering a primary X-ray source,
despite such components being required in the NGC 1365 data below 10 keV. Using
a Monte Carlo radiative transfer approach, we demonstrate that this conclusion
is invalidated by (i) use of slab absorption models, which have unrealistic
transmission spectra for partial covering gas, (ii) neglect of the effect of
Compton scattering on transmitted spectra and (iii) inadequate modeling of the
spectrum of scattered X-rays. The scattered spectrum is geometry dependent and,
for high global covering factors, may dominate above 10 keV. We further show
that, in models of circumnuclear gas, the suppression of the observed hard
X-ray flux by reprocessing may be no larger than required by the `light
bending' model invoked for inner disk reflection, and the expected emission
line strengths lie within the observed range. We conclude that the
time-invariant `red wing' in AGN X-ray spectra is probably caused by continuum
transmitted through and scattered from circumnuclear gas, not by highly
redshifted line emission, and that measurement of black hole spin is not
possible.

  of Multivariate Tail Dependence in Currency Carry Trades",,,,,"q-fin.ST q-fin.PM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The currency carry trade is the investment strategy that involves selling low
interest rate currencies in order to purchase higher interest rate currencies,
thus profiting from the interest rate differentials. This is a well known
financial puzzle to explain, since assuming foreign exchange risk is
uninhibited and the markets have rational risk-neutral investors, then one
would not expect profits from such strategies. That is uncovered interest rate
parity (UIP), the parity condition in which exposure to foreign exchange risk,
with unanticipated changes in exchange rates, should result in an outcome that
changes in the exchange rate should offset the potential to profit from such
interest rate differentials. The two primary assumptions required for interest
rate parity are related to capital mobility and perfect substitutability of
domestic and foreign assets. Given foreign exchange market equilibrium, the
interest rate parity condition implies that the expected return on domestic
assets will equal the exchange rate-adjusted expected return on foreign
currency assets.
  However, it has been shown empirically, that investors can actually earn
arbitrage profits by borrowing in a country with a lower interest rate,
exchanging for foreign currency, and investing in a foreign country with a
higher interest rate, whilst allowing for any losses (or gains) from exchanging
back to their domestic currency at maturity. Therefore trading strategies that
aim to exploit the interest rate differentials can be profitable on average.
The intention of this paper is therefore to reinterpret the currency carry
trade puzzle in light of heavy tailed marginal models coupled with multivariate
tail dependence features in the analysis of the risk-reward for the currency
portfolios with high interest rate differentials and low interest rate
differentials.

All combinations of datasets point to physics beyond the minimal

different from unity or additional relativistic degrees of freedom at
recombination (e.g., additional light neutrinos). Beyond that, the extended

the extended-ACT (eACT) dataset is perfectly consistent with the predictions of

the spectral index. Both eACT and eSPT favor additional light degrees of

nonzero neutrino masses at more than 95% confidence.

find that the photon power-law index Gamma of the Comptonization component is
almost unchangeable (Gamma~2) while the electron temperature kT_e changes from
2.9 to 21 keV during these spectral events. We also establish that for these

the intensity of Alfv\'en waves at gyro-resonant wavenumbers. The Alfv\'en
waves are traced simultaneously with the particles, so that the wave field is
propagated outwards from the Sun using WKB propagation supplemented with a
phenomenological wavenumber diffusion term and a growth rate computed from the
net flux of the accelerated particles. We consider initial wave amplitudes
small enough to allow rapid escape of particles from the shock to the ambient

acceleration of particles are generated by the accelerated particles
themselves. In this work, we study the effects of non-constant shock velocity

considered the primary source of large solar energetic particle events.
  Aims: The solar wind, which feeds shock-accelerated particles, includes
numerous ion populations, which offer much insight into acceleration processes.
We present first simulations of shock-accelerated minor ions, in order to
explore trapping dynamics and acceleration timescales in detail.
  Methods: We have simulated diffusive shock acceleration of minor ions (3He2+,
4He2+, 16O6+ and 56Fe14+) and protons using a Monte Carlo method, where
self-generated Alfv\'enic turbulence allows for repeated shock crossings and
acceleration to high energies.
  Results: We present the effect of minor ions on wave generation, especially
at low wavenumbers, and show that it is significant. We find that maximum ion
energy is determined by the competing effects of particle escape due to
focusing in an expanding flux tube and trapping due to the amplified
turbulence. We show the dependence of cut-off energy on the particle charge to
mass ratio to be approximately (Q/A)^1.5.
  Conclusions: We suggest that understanding the acceleration of minor ions at
coronal shocks requires simulations which allow us to explore trapping dynamics

trapping boundary. We conclude that steady-state models do not adequately
describe the acceleration of heavy ions in coronal shocks.

variations along its length. We quantify the locations, sizes and statistical
significance of the density structure, i.e. gaps, using a set of scaled
filters. The shapes of the filters are based on the gaps that develop in
simulations of dark matter sub-halos crossing a star stream. The high Galactic
latitude 8.4 kpc long segment of GD-1 that we examine has 8+/-3 gaps of 99%
significance or greater, with the error estimated on the basis of tests of the
gap-filtering technique. The cumulative distribution of gaps more than 3 times
the width of the stream is in good agreement with predictions for dark matter
sub-halo encounters with cold star streams. The number of gaps narrower than 3
times the width of the GD-1 stream falls well below the cold stream prediction
which is taken into account for the gap creation rate integrated over all
sizes. Simple warm stream simulations scaled to GD-1 show that the falloff in
gaps is expected for sub-halos below a mass of 10^6 M_sun. The GD-1 gaps
requires 100 sub-halos >10^6 M_sun within 30 kpc, the apocenter of GD-1 orbit.
These results are consistent with LCDM sub-halo predictions but further
improvements in stream signal-to-noise and gap modeling will be welcome.

stellar initial mass function (IMF) established? Such intermediate- and
high-mass stars may be born from relatively massive pre-stellar gas cores,
which are more massive than the thermal Jeans mass. The Turbulent Core
Accretion model invokes such cores as being in approximate virial equilibrium
and in approximate pressure equilibrium with their surrounding clump medium.
Their internal pressure is provided by a combination of turbulence and magnetic
fields. Alternatively, the Competitive Accretion model requires strongly
sub-virial initial conditions that then lead to extensive fragmentation to the
thermal Jeans scale, with intermediate- and high-mass stars later forming by
competitive Bondi-Hoyle accretion. To test these models, we have identified
four prime examples of massive (~100Msun) clumps from mid-infrared extinction
mapping of infrared dark clouds (IRDCs). Fontani et al. found high deuteration
fractions of N2H+ in these objects, which are consistent with them being
starless. Here we present ALMA observations of these four clumps that probe the
N2D+(3-2) line at 2.3"" resolution. We find six N2D+ cores and determine their
dynamical state. Their observed velocity dispersions and sizes are broadly
consistent with the predictions of the Turbulent Core model of
self-gravitating, magnetized (with Alfven Mach number m_A~1) and virialized
cores that are bounded by the high pressures of their surrounding clumps.
However, in the most massive cores, with masses up to ~60Msun, our results
suggest that moderately enhanced magnetic fields (so that m_A~0.3) may be
needed for the structures to be in virial and pressure equilibrium.
Magnetically regulated core formation may thus be important in controlling the
formation of massive cores, inhibiting their fragmentation, and thus helping to
establish the stellar IMF.

D4-brane. Interestingly, the near horizon D4-brane is shown to describe an
asymptotic Anti de Sitter (AdS) in a semi-classical regime. Using Weyl

we re-arrange the mixed dS patches to describe a Schwazschild-like dS (SdS) and
a topological-like dS (TdS) black holes. We analyze SdS vacuum for Hawking
radiations to arrive at Nariai geometry, where a discrete torsion forms a
condensate. We perform thermal analysis to identify Nariai vacuum with a TdS.
Investigation reveals an AdS patch within a thermal dS brane, which may provide
a clue to unfold dS/CFT. In addition, the role of dark energy, sourced by a
discrete torsion, in the dS vacua is investigated using Painleve geometries. It
is argued that a D-instanton pair is created by a discrete torsion, with a Big
Bang/Crunch, at the past horizon in a pure dS. Nucleation, of brane/anti-brane
pair(s), is qualitatively analyzed to construct an effective space-time on a
D4-brane and its anti brane. Analysis re-assures the significant role played by

Submitted to Journal of Discrete Algorithms (JDA)",,,,"cs.DS cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Convexity is a notion that has been defined for subsets of $\RR^n$ and for
subsets of general graphs. A convex cut of a graph $G=(V, E)$ is a
$2$-partition $V_1 \dot{\cup} V_2=V$ such that both $V_1$ and $V_2$ are convex,
\ie shortest paths between vertices in $V_i$ never leave $V_i$, $i \in \{1,
2\}$. Finding convex cuts is $\mathcal{NP}$-hard for general graphs. To
characterize convex cuts, we employ the Djokovic relation, a reflexive and
symmetric relation on the edges of a graph that is based on shortest paths
between the edges' end vertices.
  It is known for a long time that, if $G$ is bipartite and the Djokovic
relation is transitive on $G$, \ie $G$ is a partial cube, then the cut-sets of
$G$'s convex cuts are precisely the equivalence classes of the Djokovic
relation. In particular, any edge of $G$ is contained in the cut-set of exactly
one convex cut. We first characterize a class of plane graphs that we call {\em
well-arranged}. These graphs are not necessarily partial cubes, but any edge of
a well-arranged graph is contained in the cut-set(s) of at least one convex
cut. We also present an algorithm that uses the Djokovic relation for computing
all convex cuts of a (not necessarily plane) bipartite graph in $\bigO(|E|^3)$
time. Specifically, a cut-set is the cut-set of a convex cut if and only if the
Djokovic relation holds for any pair of edges in the cut-set.
  We then characterize the cut-sets of the convex cuts of a general graph $H$
using two binary relations on edges: (i) the Djokovic relation on the edges of
a subdivision of $H$, where any edge of $H$ is subdivided into exactly two
edges and (ii) a relation on the edges of $H$ itself that is not the Djokovic
relation. Finally, we use this characterization to present the first algorithm
for finding all convex cuts of a plane graph in polynomial time.

(MISO) broadcast channel (BC), recent work by Tandon et al. considered the case
where - in the presence of error-free delayed channel state information at the
transmitter (delayed CSIT) - the current CSIT for the channel of user 1 and of
user 2, alternate between the two extreme states of perfect current CSIT and of
no current CSIT.
  Motivated by the problem of having limited-capacity feedback links which may
not allow for perfect CSIT, as well as by the need to utilize any available
partial CSIT, we here deviate from this `all-or-nothing' approach and proceed -
again in the presence of error-free delayed CSIT - to consider the general
setting where current CSIT now alternates between any two qualities.
Specifically for $I_1$ and $I_2$ denoting the high-SNR asymptotic
rates-of-decay of the mean-square error of the CSIT estimates for the channel
of user~1 and of user~2 respectively, we consider the case where $I_1,I_2
\in\{\gamma,\alpha\}$ for any two positive current-CSIT quality exponents
$\gamma,\alpha$. In a fast-fading setting where we consider communication over
any number of coherence periods, and where each CSIT state $I_1I_2$ is present
for a fraction $\lambda_{I_1I_2}$ of this total duration, we focus on the
symmetric case of $\lambda_{\alpha\gamma}=\lambda_{\gamma\alpha}$, and derive
the optimal degrees-of-freedom (DoF) region. The result, which is supported by
novel communication protocols, naturally incorporates the aforementioned
`Perfect current' vs. `No current' setting by limiting $I_1,I_2\in\{0,1\}$.
  Finally, motivated by recent interest in frequency correlated channels with
unmatched CSIT, we also analyze the setting where there is no delayed CSIT.

theory -- mutual information -- to examine models of condensed matter systems.
More precisely, it studies models which are made up out of ferromagnetically
interacting spins. Quantum information theory often focuses on the ground state

temperature.
  Using mutual information, which can be seen as a generalization of
entanglement entropy to the finite-temperature case, we can study the different

find that the local pattern wavelength and orientation are typically coherent,

Endogenous pattern dynamics, when simulated for spatially homogeneous
topographic and vegetation conditions, predict pattern properties that are much
less variable than the orientation and wavelength observed in natural systems.
Our local pattern analysis, combined with ancillary datasets describing soil

soil depth, pattern coherence, vegetation cover and pattern wavelength. It
also, surprisingly, suggests that downslope accumulation of water may play a
role in changing vegetation pattern properties.

trajectories in subpopulations. Can highly-cited citation patterns be
distinguished in an early phase as ""fast-breaking"" papers? Can ""late bloomers""
or ""sleeping beauties"" be identified? Most interesting, we find differences
between ""sticky knowledge claims"" that continue to be cited more than ten years
after publication, and ""transient knowledge claims"" that show a decay pattern
after reaching a peak within a few years. Only papers following the trajectory
of a ""sticky knowledge claim"" can be expected to have a sustained impact. These
findings raise questions about indicators of ""excellence"" that use aggregated
citation rates after two or three years (e.g., impact factors). Because
aggregated citation curves can also be composites of the two patterns,
5th-order polynomials (with four bending points) are needed to capture citation
curves precisely. For the journals under study, the most frequently cited
groups were furthermore much smaller than ten percent. Although GBTM has proved
a useful method for investigating differences among citation trajectories, the

regression, we conclude that predictor variables such as journal names, number
of authors, etc., do not affect the stickiness of knowledge claims in terms of
citations, but only the levels of aggregated citations (that are
field-specific).

inherent slackness in the delay of one of the receivers. At every point in this

critical value and thus it suffices to obtain code constructions for certain
critical delays. We partially characterize the capacity in the low-delay

star formation rates (sSFR) which can be approximated by the superposition of
two log-normal distributions. The 1st of these encompasses the main sequence
(MS) of SFGs, the 2nd one a rarer population of starbursts (SB). We show that
the sSFR-distribution of SBs can be regarded as the result of a physical
process (plausibly merging) taking the mathematical form of a log-normal
boosting kernel and enhancing star formation activity. We explore the utility
of splitting the star-forming population into MS and SB galaxies - an approach
we term ""2-Star Formation Mode"" (2-SFM) framework - for understanding their
molecular gas properties. Variations of star formation efficiency (SFE) and gas
fractions among SFGs take a simple, redshift-independent form, once these
quantities are normalized to the value of an average MS galaxy. The change in
SFE for galaxies undergoing a starburst event scales supra-linearly with the
SFR-increase, as expected for mergers. This implies a continuous distribution
of galaxies in the Schmidt-Kennicutt plane that separates more clearly into
loci for SBs and normal galaxies than observed in SFR vs. M* space. SBs with
the largest deviations (>10-fold) from the MS, like many local ULIRGs, are not
average SBs, but even rarer events with progenitors having larger gas fractions
than typical MS galaxies. We statistically infer that the gas fractions of
typical SBs decrease by a factor of 2 to 3 with respect to their direct MS
progenitors, as expected to occur in short-term SFR-boosts during which
internal gas reservoirs are drained more quickly than gas is accreted from the
cosmic web. We predict variations of the CO-to-H2 conversion factor in the
SFR-M* plane and provide evidence that the higher sSFR of distant galaxies is a
direct consequence of larger gas fraction in these systems.

Y. We have modeled three giant elliptical galaxies with gradients alpha = d(log
Y)/d(log r) from -0.2 to +0.1. Color and line strength gradients suggest mildly
negative alpha in these galaxies. Introducing a negative (positive) gradient in
Y increases (decreases) the enclosed stellar mass near the center of the galaxy
and leads to systematically smaller (larger) MBH measurements. For models with
alpha = -0.2, the best-fit values of MBH are 28%, 27%, and 17% lower than the
constant-Y case, in NGC 3842, NGC 6086, and NGC 7768, respectively. For alpha =

statistical errors from individual modeling trials. At larger radii, negative
(positive) gradients in Y cause the total stellar mass to decrease (increase)

while the position loop uses only a proportional term and implements a command
shaper based on the Gauss error function. Calibration factors and software

the stellar and molecular gas kinematics from 1 kpc down to 50 pc with the aim
of identifying the dynamical processes dictating black hole accretion rates.
This first paper compares the global characteristics of a sample of ten
galaxies. We find several differences within a radius of 500 pc that are
correlated with Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) activity. The Seyferts have: (1)
a more centrally concentrated nuclear stellar surface brightness with lower
stellar luminosities beyond a radius of 100 pc, (2) a lower stellar velocity
dispersion within a radius of 200 pc, (3) elevated H2 luminosity out to a
radius of at least 250 pc, and (4) more centrally concentrated H2 surface
brightness profiles. These observed differences can be interpreted as evidence
for Seyfert galaxies having a dynamically cold (in comparison to the bulge)
nuclear structure composed of a significant gas reservoir and a relatively
young stellar population. This structure is undetected (and possibly does not
exist) in quiescent galaxies. The presence of such a nuclear structure in
Seyfert galaxies provides evidence for inflow of the surrounding interstellar
medium since the nuclear stellar population requires a supply of gas from which
to form. The fueling of a Seyfert AGN is thus associated with the formation of
a dynamically cold component of gas and stars on scales of hundreds of parsecs.

processes. Here we report on the spectroscopic identification of close physical
pairs of galaxies at redshifts 2 <z < 4 and discuss the impact of major mergers
in shaping galaxies at these early cosmological times. We aim to identify and
characterize close physical pairs of galaxies destined to merge and use their
properties to infer the contribution of merging processes to the early mass
assembly of galaxies. We search for galaxy pairs with a transverse separation
r_p < 25 h^{-1} kpc and a velocity difference Delta v < 500 km s^{-1} using the
VIMOS VLT Deep Survey (VVDS) and early data from the VIMOS Ultra Deep Survey
(VUDS) that comprise a sample of 1111 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts
measurements at redshifts 1.8 < z < 4 in the COSMOS, ECDFS, and VVDS-02h
fields. We analyse their spectra and associated visible and near-infrared
photometry to assess the main properties of merging galaxies that have an
average stellar mass M_{star}=2.3 x 10^{10} M_{sun} at these redshifts. Using
the 12 physical pairs found in our sample we obtain a first estimate of the
merger fraction at these rdshifts, fmerg ~(15-20)%. The pair separations
indicate that these pairs will merge within 1 Gyr, on average, with each
producing a more massive galaxy by the time the cosmic star formation peaks at
z~1-2. From the average mass ratio between galaxies in the pairs, the stellar
mass of the resulting galaxy after merging will be ~60% larger than the most
massive galaxy in the pair before merging. We conclude that major merging of
galaxy pairs is on-going at 2<z<4 and significantly contributing to the major
assembly phase of galaxies at this early epoch.

theory where they determine the accessibility of evolutionary paths, to
medicine where they contribute to complex genetic diseases. Until very
recently, studies on epistatic interactions have been based on a handful of
mutations, providing at best anecdotal evidence about the frequency and the
typical strength of genetic interactions. In this study we analyze the publicly
available Data Repository of Yeast Genetic INteractions (DRYGIN), which
contains the growth rates of over five million double gene knockout mutants. We
discuss a geometric definition of epistasis which reveals a simple and
surprisingly weak scaling law for the characteristic strength of genetic
interactions as a function of the effects of the mutations being combined. We
then utilize this scaling to quantify the roughness of naturally occurring
fitness landscapes. Finally, we show how the observed roughness differs from
what is predicted by Fisher's geometric model of epistasis and discuss its
consequences on the evolutionary dynamics. Although epistatic interactions
between specific genes remain largely unpredictable, the statistical properties
of an ensemble of interactions can display conspicuous regularities and be
described by simple mathematical laws. By exploiting the amount of data
produced by modern high-throughput techniques it is now possible to thoroughly
test the predictions of theoretical models of genetic interactions and to build
informed computational models of evolution on realistic fitness landscapes.

mesons above 1 GeV, we find that the data favor the scenario in which the
scalars $a_0(1450)$ and $K_0^*(1430)$ are the lowest lying $q\bar q$ bound
states. This in turn implies a preferred four-quark nature for light scalars
below 1 GeV. Assuming $K_0^*(1430)$ being a lowest lying $q\bar s$ state, we
show that the data of $B\to K_0^*(1430)\eta^{(')}$ and $B\to
K_0^*(1430)(\rho,\omega,\phi)$ can be accommodated in QCDF without introducing
power corrections induced from penguin annihilation, while the predicted
$B^-\to \ov K_0^{*0}(1430)\pi^-$ and $\ov B^0\to K_0^{*-}(1430)\pi^+$ are too
small compared to experiment. In principle, the data of $K_0^*(1430)\pi$ modes
can be explained if penguin-annihilation induced power corrections are taken
into account. However, this will destroy the agreement between theory and
experiment for $B\to K_0^*(1430)(\eta^{(')},\rho,\omega,\phi)$. Contrary to the
pseudoscalar meson sector where $B\to K\eta'$ has the largest rate in 2-body
decays of the $B$ meson, we show that $Br(B\to K_0^*\eta')<\B(B\to K_0^*\eta)$.
The decay $\ov B^0\to a_0(980)^+K^-$ is found to have a rate much smaller than
that of $\ov B^0\to a_0(980)^+\pi^-$ in QCDF, while it is the other way around
in pQCD. Experimental measurements of these two modes will help discriminate
between these two different approaches. Assuming 2-quark bound states for
$f_0(980)$ and $f_0(500)$, the observed large rates of $f_0(980)K$ and
$f_0(980)K^*$ modes can be explained in QCDF with the $f_0(980)\!-\!f_0(500)$

heavier states that couple to dark matter and are also charged under the
electroweak interactions. The recent hints of a gamma-ray line in the Fermi

We categorize such states according to their charges and decay modes, and we

that can be discovered in targeted searches at the upgraded LHC run, while also
enumerating models excluded by current data. Generally, models with
SU(2)-singlet states or models where the charged states decay predominantly to
tau leptons and/or gauge bosons are still viable. We propose searches to
constrain such models and, in particular, find superior performance over
existing proposals for multi-tau analyses. Finally, we note several scenarios,
especially those dominated by tau final states, that cannot be probed even with
300/fb at LHC14, motivating the further refinement of tau lepton searches to
improve sensitivity to such final states.

K_{s}-band imaging which covers a unique combination of a wide area (1.62
deg^2), to a significant depth (K_{s,tot} = 23.4). The SMFs of the combined
population are in good agreement with previous measurements and show that the
stellar mass density of the universe was only 50%, 10% and 1% of its current
value at z ~ 0.75, 2.0, and 3.5, respectively. The quiescent population drives
most of the overall growth, with the stellar mass density of these galaxies
increasing by 2.71^{+0.93}_{-0.22} dex since z = 3.5. At z > 2.5, star-forming
galaxies dominate the total SMF at all stellar masses, although a nonzero
population of quiescent galaxies persists to z = 4. Comparisons of the
K_{s}-selected star-forming galaxy SMFs to UV-selected SMFs at 2.5 < z < 4 show
reasonable agreement and suggests UV-selected samples are representative of the
majority of the stellar mass density at z > 3.5. We estimate the average mass
growth of individual galaxies by selecting galaxies at fixed cumulative number
density. The average galaxy with Log(M_{*}/M_{sun}) = 11.5 at z = 0.3 has grown
in mass by only 0.2 dex (0.3 dex) since z = 2.0(3.5), whereas those with
Log(M_{*}/M_{sun}) = 10.5 have grown by > 1.0 dex since z = 2. At z < 2, the
time derivatives of the mass growth are always larger for lower-mass galaxies,
which demonstrates that the mass growth in galaxies since that redshift is
mass-dependent and primarily bottom-up. Lastly, we examine potential sources of
systematic uncertainties on the SMFs and find that those from photo-z
templates, SPS modeling, and the definition of quiescent galaxies dominate the
total error budget in the SMFs.

this article we discuss properties of the SM-like Higgs production and decay
rates induced by the possible presence of light staus and light stops. Light
staus can affect the decay rate of the Higgs into di-photons and, in the case
of sizable left-right mixing, induce an enhancement in this production channel
up to $\sim$ 50% of the Standard Model rate. Light stops may induce sizable
modifications of the Higgs gluon fusion production rate and correlated
modifications to the Higgs diphoton decay. Departures from SM values of the
bottom-quark and tau-lepton couplings to the Higgs can be obtained due to Higgs
mixing effects triggered by light third generation scalar superpartners. We
describe the phenomenological implications of light staus on searches for light
stops and non-standard Higgs bosons. Finally, we discuss the current status of

hypothesized as due to spin fluctuations, has not been determined. It is the
momentum space (k-space) structure of the superconducting energy gap delta(k)
that encodes specifics of this pairing mechanism. However, because the energy
scales are so low, it has not been possible to directly measure delta(k) for
any heavy-fermion superconductor. Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference (QPI)
imaging, a proven technique for measuring the energy gaps of high-Tc
superconductors, has recently been proposed as a new method to measure delta(k)
in heavy-fermion superconductors, specifically CeCoIn5. By implementing this
method, we immediately detect a superconducting energy gap whose nodes are
oriented along k||(+-1, +-1)pi/a0 directions. Moreover, we determine the
complete k-space structure of the delta(k) of a heavy-fermion superconductor.
For CeCoIn5, this novel information includes: the complex band structure and
Fermi surface of the hybridized heavy bands, the fact that highest magnitude
delta(k) opens on a high-k band so that gap nodes occur at quite unanticipated
k-space locations, and that the Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference patterns
are most consistent with dx2-y2 gap symmetry. The availability of such
quantitative heavy band- and gap-structure data will be critical in identifying
the microscopic mechanism of heavy fermion superconductivity in this material,
and perhaps in general.

allows one to obtain an analytic expression for the number of bonds per water
molecule as a function of both its distance to a hydrophobic particle and
hydrophobe radius. This approach can be used in the density functional theory
(DFT) and computer simulations to examine particle size effects on the
hydration of particles and on their solvent-mediated interaction. For example,
it allows one to explicitly identify a water hydrogen bond contribution to the
external potential whereto a water molecule is subjected near a hydrophobe. The
DFT implementation of the model predicts the hydration free energy per unit
area of a spherical hydrophobe to be sharply sensitive to the hydropobe radius
for small radii and weakly sensitive thereto for large ones; this corroborates
the vision of the hydration of small and large length-scale particles as
occurring via different mechanisms. On the other hand, the model predicts that
the hydration of even apolar particles of small enough radii may become
thermodynamically favorable owing to the interplay of the energies of pairwise
(dispersion) water-water and water-hydrophobe interactions. This sheds light on
previous counterintuitive observations (both theoretical and simulational) that
two inert gas molecules would prefer to form a solvent-separated pair rather
than a contact one.

constructed by a Bayesian superposition of the optimal policies weighted by
their posterior probability that is updated by Bayesian inference and causal
calculus. Here we discuss three important features of this approach. First, we
discuss in how far such Thompson sampling can be regarded as a natural
consequence of the Bayesian modeling of policy uncertainty. Second, we show how
Thompson sampling can be used to study interactions between multiple adaptive
agents, thus, opening up an avenue of game-theoretic analysis. Third, we show
how Thompson sampling can be applied to infer causal relationships when
interacting with an environment in a sequential fashion. In summary, our
results suggest that Thompson sampling might not merely be a useful heuristic,
but a principled method to address problems of adaptive sequential
decision-making and causal inference.

attentions in sparse learning. Recent theoretical investigations have
demonstrated their superiority over the convex counterparts in several sparse
learning settings. However, solving the non-convex optimization problems
associated with non-convex penalties remains a big challenge. A commonly used
approach is the Multi-Stage (MS) convex relaxation (or DC programming), which
relaxes the original non-convex problem to a sequence of convex problems. This
approach is usually not very practical for large-scale problems because its
computational cost is a multiple of solving a single convex problem. In this
paper, we propose a General Iterative Shrinkage and Thresholding (GIST)
algorithm to solve the nonconvex optimization problem for a large class of
non-convex penalties. The GIST algorithm iteratively solves a proximal operator
problem, which in turn has a closed-form solution for many commonly used
penalties. At each outer iteration of the algorithm, we use a line search
initialized by the Barzilai-Borwein (BB) rule that allows finding an
appropriate step size quickly. The paper also presents a detailed convergence
analysis of the GIST algorithm. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is
demonstrated by extensive experiments on large-scale data sets.

algebraic variety) to a target finite-dimensional Lie algebra (in the case of
the current paper, we assume the latter is a simple Lie algebra) that are
equivariant with respect to the action of a finite group. In the first part of
this paper, we define global Weyl modules for equivariant map algebras
satisfying a mild assumption. We then identify a commutative algebra A that
acts naturally on the global Weyl modules, which leads to a Weyl functor from
the category of A-modules to the category of modules for the equivariant map
algebra in question. These definitions extend the ones previously given for
generalized current algebras (i.e. untwisted map algebras) and twisted loop
algebras.
  In the second part of the paper, we restrict our attention to equivariant map
algebras where the group involved is abelian, acts on the target Lie algebra by
diagram automorphisms, and freely on (the set of rational points of) the
scheme. Under these additional assumptions, we prove that A is finitely
generated and the global Weyl module is a finitely generated A-module. We also
define local Weyl modules via the Weyl functor and prove that these coincide
with the local Weyl modules defined directly in a previous paper. Finally, we
show that A is the algebra of coinvariants of the analogous algebra in the
untwisted case.

by the United States government. The network will be based on long term
evolution (LTE) standards and use recently designated spectrum in the 700 MHz
band. The public safety network has different objectives and traffic patterns
than commercial wireless networks. In particular, the public safety network
puts more emphasis on coverage, reliability and latency in the worst case
scenario. Moreover, the routine public safety traffic is relatively light,
whereas when a major incident occurs, the traffic demand at the incident scene
can be significantly heavier than that in a commercial network. Hence it is
prohibitively costly to build the public safety network using conventional
cellular network architecture consisting of an infrastructure of stationary
base transceiver stations. A novel architecture is proposed in this paper for
the public safety broadband network. The architecture deploys stationary base
stations sparsely to serve light routine traffic and dispatches mobile base
stations to incident scenes along with public safety personnel to support heavy
traffic. The analysis shows that the proposed architecture can potentially
offer more than 75% reduction in terms of the total number of base stations
needed.

implies the polynomial time solvability of many natural counting problems on

digraph width measures, we observe that any digraph of directed path-width d

digraphs on n vertices admitting a z-topological order for z = 2, but whose

path-width can have both arbitrarily large undirected tree-width and
arbitrarily large clique width, our result provides for the first time a

and constant clique width to the realm of digraph width measures that are
closed under taking subgraphs and whose constant levels incorporate families of

at (i) small distance scales and (ii) recent epochs, implying that the FLRW
approximation is most likely to fail at these scales. We use the virialisation
fraction to quantify (i) and (ii), which approximately coincide with each other
on the observational past light cone. For increasing time, the virialisation
fraction increases above 10% at about the same redshift (sim 1-3) at which
Omega_Lambda grows above 10% (approx 1.8). Thus, instead of non-zero
Omega_Lambda, we propose an approximate, general-relativistic correction to the
matter-dominated (Omega_m =1, Omega_Lambda=0), homogeneous metric (Einstein de

the LambdaCDM distance modulus. This rough approximation assumes ""old physics""

shading problem unique to monolithic TFPV, arising from thin long rectangular

shaded cell experiences higher heat dissipation due to a redistribution of
voltages and currents in this two dimensional geometry. We also analyze the
effect of shadow size and orientation by considering several possible shading
scenarios. We find that thin edge shadows can cause potentially catastrophic
reverse bias damage, depending on their orientation. Finally, we show that
external bypass diodes cannot protect the individual cells from shadow-induced
reverse stress, but can improve the string output for larger shadows.

special cases, we obtain new (or recover well-known) formulae for the
Baum-Fulton-MacPherson Todd (or MacPherson-Chern) classes of toric varieties,
as well as for the Thom-Milnor L-classes of simplicial projective toric

characteristic classes of toric varieties. First, we take advantage of the
torus-orbit decomposition and the motivic properties of the motivic Chern and
resp. homology Hirzebruch classes to express the latter in terms of dualizing
sheaves and resp. the (dual) Todd classes of closures of orbits. This method
even applies to torus-invariant subspaces of a given toric variety. The
obtained formula is then applied to weighted lattice point counting in lattice
polytopes and their subcomplexes, yielding generalized Pick-type formulae.
Secondly, in the case of simplicial toric varieties, we compute our
characteristic classes by using the Lefschetz-Riemann-Roch theorem of
Edidin-Graham in the context of the geometric quotient description of such
varieties. In this setting, we define mock Hirzebruch classes of simplicial
toric varieties and investigate the difference between the (actual) homology
Hirzebruch class and the mock Hirzebruch class. We show that this difference is
localized on the singular locus, and we obtain a formula for it in which the
contribution of each singular cone is identified explicitly. Finally, the two
methods of computing characteristic classes are combined for proving several
characteristic class formulae originally obtained by Cappell and Shaneson in
the early 1990s.

power spectrum. To resolve the ambiguity in this inverse problem, one might
invoke prior knowledge about the signal, but phase retrieval algorithms in this
vein have found limited success. One alternative is to create redundancy in the
measurement process by illuminating the signal multiple times, distorting the
signal each time with a different mask. Despite several recent advances in
phase retrieval, the community has yet to construct an ensemble of masks which
uniquely determines all signals and admits an efficient reconstruction
algorithm. In this paper, we leverage the recently proposed polarization method
to construct such an ensemble. We also present numerical simulations to
illustrate the stability of the polarization method in this setting. In
comparison to a state-of-the-art phase retrieval algorithm known as PhaseLift,
we find that polarization is much faster with comparable stability.

continue the theme begun in [Phys. Rev. B 88, 184430 (2013)], of exploring how
spin-nematic order reveals itself in the spectrum of spin excitations. Building
on an earlier analysis of inelastic neutron scattering [Phys. Rev. B 91, 174402

and its fluctuations.Turning to the specific case of spin-1/2 frustrated
ferromagnets, we show that the signal from competing spin-wave excitations can
be suppressed through a judicious choice of nuclear site and field direction.

In a previous study we showed that low-frequency heating can account for 0% to
77% of active region core emission measures. We now turn our attention to
heating by a finite succession of impulsive events for which the timescale
between events on a single magnetic strand is shorter than the cooling
timescale. We refer to this scenario as a ""nanoflare train"" and explore a
parameter space of heating and coronal loop properties with a hydrodynamic
model. Our conclusions are: (1) nanoflare trains are consistent with 86% to
100% of observed active region cores when uncertainties in the atomic data are
properly accounted for; (2) steeper slopes are found for larger values of the
ratio of the train duration $\Delta_H$ to the post-train cooling and draining
timescale $\Delta_C$, where $\Delta_H$ depends on the number of heating events,
the event duration and the time interval between successive events ($\tau_C$);
(3) $\tau_C$ may be diagnosed from the width of the hot component of the
emission measure provided that the temperature bins are much smaller than 0.1
dex; (4) the slope of the emission measure alone is not sufficient to provide
information about any timescale associated with heating - the length and
density of the heated structure must be measured for $\Delta_H$ to be uniquely
extracted from the ratio $\Delta_H/\Delta_C$.

an equilibrium of a stochastic Nash game. Standard SA schemes employ
diminishing steplength sequences that are square summable but not summable.
Such requirements provide a little or no guidance for how to leverage
Lipschitzian and monotonicity properties of the problem and naive choices
generally do not preform uniformly well on a breadth of problems. While a
centralized adaptive stepsize SA scheme is proposed in [1] for the optimization
framework, such a scheme provides no freedom for the agents in choosing their
own stepsizes. Thus, a direct application of centralized stepsize schemes is
impractical in solving Nash games. Furthermore, extensions to game-theoretic
regimes where players may independently choose steplength sequences are limited
to recent work by Koshal et al. [2]. Motivated by these shortcomings, we
present a distributed algorithm in which each player updates his steplength
based on the previous steplength and some problem parameters. The steplength
rules are derived from minimizing an upper bound of the errors associated with
players' decisions. It is shown that these rules generate sequences that
converge almost surely to an equilibrium of the stochastic Nash game.
Importantly, variants of this rule are suggested where players independently
select steplength sequences while abiding by an overall coordination
requirement. Preliminary numerical results are seen to be promising.

correlation functions to obtain constraints, at the effective redshift $z=0.57$
of the sample, on the Hubble expansion rate $H(z)$, the angular-diameter
distance $D_A(z)$, the normalized growth rate $f(z)\sigma_8(z)$, the physical
matter density $\Omega_m h^2$, and the biased amplitude of matter fluctuation
b\sigma_8(z). We obtain {$H(0.57)$, $D_A(0.57)$, $f(0.57)\sigma_8(0.57)$,

priors from other data sets (i.e., CMB) are adopted and no dark energy models
are assumed, our results from BOSS CMASS galaxy clustering alone may be
combined with other data sets, i.e. CMB, SNe, lensing or other galaxy

show that the major power on constraining dark energy from the anisotropic
galaxy clustering signal, as compared to the angular-averaged one (monopole),
arises from including the normalized growth rate $f(z)\sigma_8(z)$. In the case
of the wCDM cosmological model our single-probe CMASS constraints, combined
with CMB (WMAP9+SPT), yield a value for the dark energy equation of state
parameter of $w=-0.90\pm0.11$. Therefore, it is important to include
$f(z)\sigma_8(z)$ while investigating the nature of dark energy with current
and upcoming large-scale galaxy surveys.

oscillations in neutron star crusts in a manner that is dependent on the
parameter $L$ characterizing the poorly known density dependence of the
symmetry energy. The identification of the lowest quasiperiodic oscillation
(QPO) among the observed QPOs from giant flares in soft-gamma repeaters as the
$/ell=2$ fundamental torsional oscillations enables us to constrain the
parameter $L$ as $L/ge 47.4$ MeV, which is the most conservative restriction on
$L$ obtained in the present work that assumes that the mass and radius of the
flaring neutron stars range 1.4-1.8 $M_{/odot}$ and 10-14 km. Next, we identify
one by one a set of the low-lying frequencies observed in giant flares as the
fundamental torsional oscillations. The values of $L$ that can reproduce all
the observed frequencies in terms of the torsional oscillations coupled with a
part of dripped neutrons via entrainment effects are then constrained as 101.1
MeV $/le L /le$ 131.0 MeV. Alternatively, if only the second lowest frequency
observed in SGR 1806$-$20 has a different origin, one obtains relatively low
$L$ values ranging 58.0 MeV $/le L /le$ 85.3 MeV, which seem more consistent
with other empirical constraints despite large uncertainties.

transport in a disordered molecular system containing spatial and energetic
disorders using the dipolar glass model. Model parameters of the material were
chosen to fit a typical polar organic photoconductor polycarbonate doped with
30% of aromatic hydrazone, whose transport properties are well documented in
literature. Simulated carrier mobility demonstrates a usual Poole-Frenkel field
dependence and its slope is very close to the experimental value without using
any adjustable parameter. At room temperature transients are universal with
respect to the electric field and transport layer thickness. At the same time,
carrier mobility does not depend on the layer thickness and transients develop
a well-defined plateau where the current does not depend on time, thus
demonstrating a non-dispersive transport regime. Tails of the transients decay
as power law with the exponent close to -2. This particular feature indicates
that transients are close to the boundary between dispersive and non-dispersive
transport regimes. Shapes of the simulated transients are in very good
agreement with the experimental ones. In summary, we provide a first
verification of a self-consistency of the dipolar glass transport model, where
major transport parameters, extracted from the experimental transport data, are
then used in the transport simulation, and the resulting mobility field
dependence and transients are in very good agreement with the initial

silicate mantle crystallizing from a magma ocean, or an ice shell surrounding a
deep water ocean) a convecting crystalline layer is in contact with a layer of
its melt. Allowing for melting/freezing at one or both of the boundaries of the
solid layer is likely to affect the pattern of convection in the layer. We
study here the onset of thermal convection in a viscous spherical shell with
dynamically induced melting/freezing at either or both of its boundaries. It is
shown that the behavior of each interface depends on the value of a dimensional
number P, which is the ratio of a melting/freezing timescale over a viscous
relaxation timescale. A small value of P corresponds to permeable boundary
conditions, while a large value of P corresponds to impermeable boundary
conditions. The linear stability analysis predicts a significant effect of
semi-permeable boundaries when the number P characterizing either of the
boundary is small enough: allowing for melting/freezing at either of the
boundary results in the emergence of larger scale convective modes. The effect
is particularly drastic when the outer boundary is permeable, since the degree
1 mode remains the most unstable even in the case of thin spherical shells. In
the case of a spherical shell with permeable inner and outer boundaries, the
most unstable mode consists in a global translation of the solid shell, with no
deformation. In the limit of a full sphere with permeable outer boundary, this
corresponds to the ""convective translation"" mode recently proposed for Earth's
inner core. As an example of possible application, we discuss the case of
thermal convection in Enceladus' ice shell assuming the presence of a global
subsurface ocean, and found that melting/freezing could have an important
effect on the pattern of convection in the ice shell.

positive cosmological constant have recently attracted considerable attention.
In this paper our first goal is to compare the evolution of the first and
second order perturbations by determining their asymptotic behaviour at late
times in ever-expanding models. We show that in the presence of spatial
curvature K or a positive cosmological constant, the density perturbation
approaches a finite limit both to first and second order, but the rate of
approach depends on the model, being power law in the scale factor if the
cosmological constant is positive but logarithmic if it is zero and and K<0.
Scalar perturbations in general contain a growing and a decaying mode. We find,
somewhat surprisingly, that if the cosmological constant is positive the
decaying mode does not die away, i.e. it contributes on an equal footing as the
growing mode to the asymptotic expression for the density perturbation. On the
other hand, the future asymptotic regime of the Einstein-de Sitter universe
(for which the cosmological constant and the spatial curvature are both zero)
is completely different, as exemplified by the density perturbation which
diverges; moreover, the second order perturbation diverges faster than the
first order perturbation, which suggests that the Einstein-de Sitter universe
is unstable to perturbations, and that the perturbation series do not converge
towards the future. We conclude that the presence of spatial curvature or a
cosmological constant stabilizes the perturbations. Our second goal is to
derive an explicit expression for the second order density perturbation that
can be used to study the effects of including a cosmological constant and
spatial curvature.

satisfies $1<q<\frac{n}{n-2}$ in case $n\geq 3$ and $1<q<\infty$ in case $n=1$

existence of fully nontrivial nonnegative solutions which converge to a
solution of some optimal partition problem as $b\to -\infty$. In case $n=1$ we
prove that minimal energy solutions exist provided the coupling parameter $b$
has small absolute value whereas fully nontrivial solutions do not exist if
$1<q\leq 2$ and $b$ has large absolute value.

test the accuracy of a cosmological N-body code in the non linear regime as it
is approximately equivalent to that of a truly isolated cloud of particles,
with same density profile and velocity distribution, in a non expanding
background. This is the case as long as the system size is smaller than the
simulation box side, so that its interaction with the infinite copies can be
neglected. In such a situation, the over-density rapidly undergoes to a global
collapse forming a quasi stationary state in virial equilibrium. However, by
evolving the system with a cosmological code (GADGET) for a sufficiently long
time, a clear deviation from such quasi-equilibrium configuration is observed.
This occurs in a time t_{LI} that depends on the values of the simulation
numerical parameters such as the softening length and thetime-stepping
accuracy, i.e. it is a numerical artifact related to the limited spatial and
temporal resolutions. The analysis of the Layzer-Irvine cosmic energy equation,
confirms that this deviation corresponds to an unphysical dynamical regime. By
varying the numerical parameters of the simulation and the physical parameters
of the system we show that the unphysical behaviour originates from badly
integrated close scatterings of high velocity particles. We find that, while
the structure may remain virialized in the unphysical regime, its density and
velocity profiles are modified with respect to the quasi-equilibrium
configurations, converging however to well defined shapes, the former
characterised by a Navarro Frenk White-type behaviour.

linear temporal logic (LTL) and two-variable first-order logic (FO2). LTL is
more expressive but FO2 can be more succinct, and hence it is not clear which
should be easier to verify. We take a comprehensive look at the issue, giving a
comparison of verification problems for FO2, LTL, and various sublogics thereof
across a wide range of models. In particular, we look at unary temporal logic
(UTL), a subset of LTL that is expressively equivalent to FO2; we also consider
the stutter-free fragment of FO2, obtained by omitting the successor relation,
and the expressively equivalent fragment of UTL, obtained by omitting the next
and previous connectives. We give three logic-to-automata translations which
can be used to give upper bounds for FO2 and UTL and various sublogics. We
apply these to get new bounds for both non-deterministic systems (hierarchical
and recursive state machines, games) and for probabilistic systems (Markov
chains, recursive Markov chains, and Markov decision processes). We couple
these with matching lower-bound arguments. Next, we look at combining FO2
verification techniques with those for LTL. We present here a language that
subsumes both FO2 and LTL, and inherits the model checking properties of both
languages. Our results give both a unified approach to understanding the

block-structured meshes that has been developed at the University of
Erlangen-Nuremberg since the early 1990s. It can be used to solve the laminar
or turbulent incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Up to now its scalability
was strongly limited by a rather rigid communication infrastructure, which led
to a dominance of MPI time already at small process counts.
  This paper describes several optimizations to increase the performance,
scalability, and flexibility of FASTEST-3D. First, a node-level performance
analysis is carried out in order to pinpoint the main bottlenecks and identify
sweet spots for energy-efficient execution. In addition, a single-precision
version of the solver for the linear equation system arising from the
discretization of the governing equations is devised, which significantly
increases the single-core performance. Then the communication mechanisms in
FASTEST-3D are analyzed and a new communication strategy based on non-blocking
calls is implemented. Performance results with the revised version show
significantly increased single-node performance and considerably improved
communication patterns along with much better parallel scalability. In this
context we discuss the concept of ""acceptable parallel efficiency"" and how it
influences the real gain of the optimizations. Scaling measurements are carried
out on a modern petascale system. The obtained improvements are of major
importance for the use of FASTEST-3D on current high-performance computer
clusters and will help to perform simulations with much higher spatial and
temporal resolution to tackle turbulent flow in technical applications.

and not increasing, with increasing cosmological constant. The minimum
temperature for which metastable states exist is decreasing with increasing
cosmological constant, while above some positive value of the cosmological

merge when the cosmological density equals one half the mean density of the

cluster survey will constrain the total neutrino mass and effective number of
neutrino species. We base our analysis on the Monte Carlo Markov Chains
technique by combining information from cluster number counts and cluster power
spectrum. We find that combining cluster data with CMB measurements from Planck
improves by more than an order of magnitude the constraint on neutrino masses
compared to each probe used independently. For the LCDM+m_nu model the 2 sigma
upper limit on total neutrino mass shifts from M_nu < 0.35 eV using cluster
data alone to M_nu < 0.031 eV when combined with CMB data. When a non-standard
model with N_eff number of neutrino species is considered, we estimate
N_eff<3.14 (95% CL), while the bounds on neutrino mass are relaxed to M_nu <
0.040 eV. This accuracy would be sufficient for a 2 sigma detection of neutrino
mass even in the minimal normal hierarchy scenario. We also consider scenarios
with a constant dark energy equation of state and a non-vanishing curvature.
When these models are considered the error on M_nu is only slightly affected,
while there is a larger impact of the order of ~ 15 % and ~ 20% respectively on
the 2 sigma error bar of N_eff with respect to the standard case. We also treat
the LCDM+m_nu+N_eff case with free nuisance parameters, which parameterize the
uncertainties on the cluster mass determination. In this case, the upper bounds
on M_nu are relaxed by a factor larger than two, M_nu < 0.083 eV (95% CL),
hence compromising the possibility of detecting the total neutrino mass with
good significance. We thus confirm the potential that a large optical/near-IR
cluster survey, like that to be carried out by Euclid, could have in
constraining neutrino properties [abridged].

significance larger than 3 sigma. As all but three have centroid frequencies

FWHM are 67.3 +/- 2.0 Hz and 4.4 +/- 2.4 Hz respectively. Their fractional rms
varies between 0.4% and 2% (total band detections) and between 0.5% and 3%

by a bright accretion disk component. However, the rms spectrum of the HFQPO is
very hard and does not show a flattening up to 40 keV, where the fractional rms

structures (quartets). These are real superpositions of products of two pairs
of particles in time-reversed states. Quartets are determined variationally
through an iterative sequence of diagonalizations of the Hamiltonian in
restricted model spaces and are, in principle, all distinct from one another.
The ground state is represented as a product of quartets to which, depending on
the number of particles (supposed to be even, in any case), an extra collective
pair is added. The extra pair is also determined variationally. In case of
pairing in a spherically symmetric mean field, both the quartets and the extra
pair (if any) are characterized by a total angular momentum J=0. Realistic
applications of the quartet formalism are carried out for the Sn isotopes with
the valence neutrons in the 50-82 neutron shell. Exact ground state correlation
energies, occupation numbers and pair transfer matrix elements are reproduced
to a very high degree of precision. The formalism also lends itself to a
straightforward and accurate description of the lowest seniority 0 and 2

analysis with theoretical models of hot Jupiters. We observed a complete
transit of WASP-23b in seven bands simultaneously, using the GROND instrument
on the MPG/ESO 2.2m telescope at La Silla Observatory and telescope
defocussing. The optical data were taken in the Sloan g',r',i' and z' bands.
The resulting light curves are of high quality, with a root-mean-square scatter
of the residual as low as 330ppm in the z'-band, with a cadence of 90s.
Near-infrared data were obtained in the JHK bands. We performed MCMC analysis

having a mass around 125 GeV and also indicated that there is an enhancement in
the Higgs to diphoton decay rate as compared to that in the standard model. We
have studied implications of these discoveries in the bilinear R-parity
violating supersymmetric model, whose main motivation is to explain the
non-zero masses for neutrinos. The R-parity violating parameters in this model
are $\epsilon$ and $b_\epsilon$, and these parameters determine the scale of
neutrino masses. If the enhancement in the Higgs to diphoton decay rate is
true, then we have found $\epsilon\gapprox 0.01$ GeV and $b_\epsilon\sim$ 1
GeV$^2$ in order to be compatible with the neutrino oscillation data. Also, in
the above mentioned analysis, we can determine the soft masses of sleptons
($m_L$) and CP-odd Higgs boson mass ($m_A$). We have estimated that
$m_L\gapprox$ 300 GeV and $m_A\gapprox$ 700 GeV. We have also commented on the
allowed values of $\epsilon$ and $b_\epsilon$, in case there is no enhancement
in the Higgs to diphoton decay rate. Finally, we present a model to explain the
smallness of $\epsilon$ and $b_\epsilon$.

mid-infrared classes, ranging from AGN (class-4) and star forming nuclei
(class-3), transition class-2 (with PAHs) and class-1 (no-PAHs) to passively
evolving nuclei (class-0). A demographic study of mid-infrared spectra shows
that Es are significantly more passive than S0s: 46^{+11}_{-10}% of Es and
20^{+11}_{-7}% of S0s have a spectrum of class-0. Emission lines are revealed

that mid-infrared spectral classes are connected to phases of

The model takes into account wave and internal adiabatic heating mechanisms, as
well as radiative and adiabatic cooling. The importance of external sources of
energy is discussed. We also studied the role of the spatial distribution of
dark matter in the acceleration of the wind and on the mass loss rates. The
basic model parameters that regulate the wind mass loss rate and terminal
velocity are the gravitational potential profile, the equilibrium temperature
of the gas and the amplitude of the turbulent motions of the gas. We found that
dwarf galaxies are likely to present quasi-stationary winds with mass loss
rates larger than $10^{-3}$M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ even in the absence of
turbulent motions (which is possibly related to the SNe feedback), if the
interstellar gas is heated to $T > 10^4 - 10^5$K. We also found that the wind
mass loss rate is enhanced for cusped dark matter distributions, such as the
NFW-profile, due to the increased pressure gradients at the center of the
galaxy. The solutions presented here may serve as benchmarks for numerical
simulations, and as inputs for single zone chemical evolution models of dwarf
galaxies.

atmospheric composition close to that of today's Pluto and a broad range of
surface pressures, we find that Ar, Kr and Xe can be efficiently trapped in
clathrates if they formed at the surface, in a way similar to what has been
proposed for Titan. The formation on Pluto of clathrates rich in noble gases
could then induce a strong decrease in their atmospheric abundances relative to
their initial values. A clathrate thickness of order of a few centimeters
globally averaged on the planet is enough to trap all Ar, Kr and Xe if these
noble gases were in protosolar proportions in Pluto's early atmosphere. Because
atmospheric escape over an extended period of time (millions of years) should
lead to a noble gas abundance that either remains constant or increases with
time, we find that a potential depletion of Ar, Kr and Xe in the atmosphere
would best be explained by their trapping in clathrates. A key observational
test is the measurement of Ar since the Alice UV spectrometer aboard the New

times smaller than in the case considered here.

it is within the uncertainties that the planet may host a weak thermal
inversion. The data are equally well fit by atmospheric models with or without

does not change enough over the time-scales of months or years to change the
interpretation of the Knutson et al. (2010) activity-inversion relation,
provided that the measured activity level is averaged over several nights.

samples interior has to be transferred to the sample surface by certain waves,

be detected and the interior structure is reconstructed from the measured
signals. The amount of information about the interior of the sample, which can
be gained from the detected waves on the sample surface, is essentially
influenced by the propagation from its excitation to the surface. Scattering,
dissipation, or diffusion causes entropy production and a loss of information
for the propagating waves, and therefore results in a loss of resolution for
imaging the interior structure. There have been made several attempts to
compensate these diffusive or dissipative effects to get a higher resolution
for the reconstructed images of the samples interior. In this work it is shown
that thermodynamical fluctuations limit this compensation and therefore also
the spatial resolution for non-destructive imaging at a certain depth is
limited. We describe one example for diffusion and another one for dissipation
and the loss of information is modeled by stochastic processes. For both

formation when planetesimals accumulate to form planetary embryos. We use the
hydrodynamical code FARGO to study the evolution of the disk and of a test
population of planetesimals embedded in it. With this hybrid
hydrodynamical--N--body code we can properly account for the gas drag force on
the planetesimals and for the gravitational force of the disk on them. The
numerical simulations show that the gravity of the eccentric disk on the
planetesimal swarm excites their eccentricities to values much larger than
those induced by the binary perturbations only within 10 AU from the stars.
Moreover, the disk gravity prevents a full alignment of the planetesimal
pericenters. Both these effects lead to large impact velocities, beyond the
critical value for erosion. Planetesimals accumulation in circumbinary disks
appears to be prevented close to the stellar pair by the gravitational
perturbations of the circumbinary disk. The observed planets possibly formed in
the outer regions of the disk and then migrated inside by tidal interaction
with the disk.

stabilize itself against drifts in component properties and to continually
adjust itself to changing conditions. This self-configuration operates by
training with the desired pairs of orthogonal input and output functions, using
sets of detectors and local feedback loops to set individual optical elements
within the device, with no global feedback or multiparameter optimization
required. Simple mappings, such as spatial mode conversions and polarization
control, can be implemented using standard planar integrated optics. In the
spirit of a universal machine, we show that other linear operations, including
frequency and time mappings, as well as non-reciprocal operation, are possible
in principle, even if very challenging in practice, thus proving there is at
least one constructive design for any conceivable linear optical component;
such a universal device can also be self-configuring. This approach is general
for linear waves, and could be applied to microwaves, acoustics and quantum
mechanical superpositions.

reverse breakdown of partially shaded cells, (b) improve the overall power
output under partial shading, and (c) in case of spiral design, improve the

laminates may not be available for testing. In such cases, full-field
displacement measurements offer the potential of identifying several material
properties simultaneously. For that, it is desirable to create complex
displacement fields that are strongly influenced by all the elastic constants.
In this work, we explore the potential of using a laminated plate with an
open-hole under traction loading to achieve that and identify all four ply
elastic constants (E 1, E 2, 12, G 12) at once. However, the accuracy of the
identified properties may not be as good as properties measured from individual
tests due to the complexity of the experiment, the relative insensitivity of
the measured quantities to some of the properties and the various possible
sources of uncertainty. It is thus important to quantify the uncertainty (or
confidence) with which these properties are identified. Here, Bayesian
identification is used for this purpose, because it can readily model all the
uncertainties in the analysis and measurements, and because it provides the
full coupled probability distribution of the identified material properties. In
addition, it offers the potential to combine properties identified based on
substantially different experiments. The full-field measurement is obtained by
moir\'e interferometry. For computational efficiency the Bayesian approach was
applied to a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) of the displacement fields.
The analysis showed that the four orthotropic elastic constants are determined
with quite different confidence levels as well as with significant correlation.
Comparison with manufacturing specifications showed substantial difference in
one constant, and this conclusion agreed with earlier measurement of that
constant by a traditional four-point bending test. It is possible that the POD
approach did not take full advantage of the copious data provided by the full
field measurements, and for that reason that data is provided for others to use
(as on line material attached to the article).

rotation rate and Alfv\'en frequency of the field are of the same order, almost
independent of the magnetic Prandtl number Pm. For the very steep rotation law
\Omega\propto R^{-2} (the Rayleigh limit) and for small Pm the threshold values
of rotation and field for this Azimuthal MagnetoRotational Instability (AMRI)
scale with the ordinary Reynolds number and the Hartmann number, resp. A
laboratory experiment with liquid metals like sodium or gallium in a
Taylor-Couette container has been designed on the basis of this finding. For
fluids with more flat rotation laws the Reynolds number and the Hartmann number
are no longer typical quantities for the instability. For the weakly nonlinear
system the numerical values of the kinetic energy and the magnetic energy are
derived for magnetic Prandtl numbers \leq 1. We find that the magnetic energy
grows monotonically with the magnetic Reynolds number Rm, while the kinetic
energy grows with Rm/\sqrt{Pm}. The resulting turbulent Schmidt number, as the
ratio of the `eddy' viscosity and the diffusion coefficient of a passive scalar

unity. Hence, in a stellar core with fossil fields and steep rotation law the
transport of angular momentum by AMRI is always accompanied by an intense
mixing of the plasma, until the rotation becomes rigid.

application of the Kalman filter (KF) for dynamic positioning purpose. The use
of gradient-based optimization methods in the AF computational schemes yields
to a set of the filter sensitivity equations and a set of matrix Riccati-type

the conventional KF, which is known to be numerically unstable, and its

and simple computational technique replaces the standard methodology based on
direct differentiation of the conventional KF equations (with their inherent
numerical instability) by advanced square-root filters (and its derivatives as
well). As a result, it improves the robustness of the computations against
roundoff errors and leads to accurate variants of the gradient-based AFs.
Additionally, such methods are ideal for simultaneous state estimation and
parameter identification since all values are computed in parallel. The

spatial behavior of collisional and radiative transfer effects in He^+. The HeI
lines are analysed based on data obtained with FLAMES and GMOS. Collisional
effects are negligible for transitions in the singlet cascade while relatively
important for those in the triplet cascade. In particular, they can contribute
up to 20% of the flux in the HeIl7065 line. Radiative transfer effects are
important over an extended and circular area of 30pc in diameter centered at
the Super Star Clusters. HeI abundance, y^+, has been mapped using extinction
corrected fluxes of six HeI lines, realistic assumptions for T_e, n_e, and the
stellar absorption equivalent width as well as the most recent emissivities. We
found a mean of 10^3 y^+ ~80.3 over the mapped area. The relation between the
excitation and the total helium abundance, y_tot, is consistent with no
abundance gradient. Uncertainties in the derivation of He abundances are
dominated by the adopted assumptions. We illustrated the difficulty of
detecting a putative He enrichment due to the presence of Wolf-Rayet stars in
the main GHIIR. Data are marginally consistent with an excess in the N/He ratio
in the N enriched area of the order of both, the atmospheric N/He ratios in WR
stars and the uncertainties estimated for the N/He ratios.

packing. It has long been appreciated that higher densities are achieved by
using collections of particles with a variety of sizes. The variety of sizes is
often quantified by the polydispersity of the particle size distribution: the
standard deviation of the radius divided by the mean radius. Several prior
studies quantified the increase of the packing density as a function of
polydispersity. Of course, a particle size distribution is also characterized
by its skewness, kurtosis, and higher moments, but the influence of these
parameters has not been carefully quantified before. In this work, we
numerically generate many packings with different particle radii distributions,
varying polydispersity and skewness independently of one another. We find two
significant results. First, the skewness can have a significant effect on the
packing density and in some cases can have a larger effect than polydispersity.
Second, the packing fraction is relatively insensitive to the value of the
kurtosis. We present a simple empirical formula for the value of the random
close packing density as a function of polydispersity and skewness.

Mode Coupling Theory (MCT) calculations, for the Square Shoulder (SS) model, a
purely repulsive potential where the hard-core is complemented by a finite
shoulder. For the one-component version of this model, MCT predicted [Sperl
{\it et al.} Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 104}, 145701 (2010)] the presence of
diffusion anomalies both upon cooling and upon compression and the occurrence
of glass-glass transitions. In the simulations, we focus on a non-crystallising
binary mixture, which, at the investigated shoulder width, shows a
non-monotonic behaviour of the diffusion upon cooling but not upon isothermal
compression. In addition, we find the presence of a disconnected glass-glass
line in the phase diagram, ending in two higher-order singularities. These
points generate a logarithmic dependence of the density correlators as well as
a subdiffusive behaviour of the mean squared displacement, although with the
interference of the nearby liquid-glass transition. We also perform novel MCT
calculations using as input the partial structure factors obtained within MD,
confirming the simulation results. The presence of two hard sphere glasses,
differing only in their hard core length, is revealed, showing that the simple
competition between the two is sufficient for creating a rather complex
dynamical behaviour.

integer greater than four can be written as the sum of two prime numbers. Since
then, no one has been able to prove the conjecture. The only best known result
so far is that every sufficiently large even integer N can be written as the
sum of a prime number and the product of at most two prime numbers.
Additionally, the conjecture has been verified to be true for all even integers
up to 4.10^18. In this paper, we prove that the conjecture is true for all even
integers greater than 362.

theory; in this paper we study the 'logical' implications of taking this claim
at face value, constructing a propositional lattice for the space of coevents
applicable to a given histories theory and comparing it to the more traditional
propositional lattice of events. In particular we focus on multiplicative
coevents, and find that the precise nature of their anhomomorphism leads to a
particularly simple relationship between the two propositional lattices.
Finally, we notice that our constructions contain elements intuitively similar
to topos nations of truth values and use this to suggest a means of applying
Isham's topos theoretic constructions to multiplicative coevents.

  hydrophobic hydration","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1303.4429",,"10.1063/1.4828459",,"cond-mat.soft physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The thermodynamics of hydration changes gradually from entropic for small
solutes to enthalpic for large ones. The small-to-large crossover lengthscale
of hydrophobic hydration depends on the thermodynamic conditions of the solvent
such as temperature, pressure, presence of additives, etc... We attempt to shed
some light on the temperature dependence of the crossover lengthscale by using
a probabilistic approach to water hydrogen bonding that allows one to obtain an
analytic expression for the number of bonds per water molecule as a function of
both its distance to a solute and solute radius. Incorporating that approach
into the density functional theory, one can examine the solute size effects on
its hydration over the entire small-to-large lengthscale range at different
temperatures. Knowing the dependence of the hydration free energy on
temperature and solute size, one can obtain its enthalpic and entropic
contributions as functions of temperature and solute size. These function can
provide interesting insight into the temperature dependence of the crossover
lengthscale of hydrophobic hydration. The model was applied to the hydration of
spherical particles of various radii in water in the temperature range from
T=293.15 K to T=333.15 K. The model predictions for the temperature dependence
of the hydration free energy of small hydrophobes are consistent with the
experimental and simulational data. Three alternative definitions for the
small-to-large crossover length-scale of hydrophobic hydration are proposed,
and their temperature dependence is obtained. Depending on the definition and
temperature, the small-to-large crossover in the hydration mechanism is
predicted to occur for hydrophobes of radii from one to several nanometers.
Independent of its definition, the crossover length-scale is predicted to
decrease with increasing temperature.

noncommutative Schwarzschild-deSitter black hole. In this setup, there exists a
similarity between the small and large scales. There are two finite cut-off in
very short and long distances wherein the force and energy graph stop abruptly
at those scales. We find that the existence of a deSitter core around the
origin, induced by noncommutativity, in addition to a standard deSitter
background at large scale may lead to a violation of the equivalence principle.
Finally in order to directly observe the finite cut-off at short-scale gravity,
caused by noncommutativity quantum fluctuations, we derive an effective
gravitational constant.

Snyder which describes a collapsar, that is an idealized star of

material has a final state resembling a football, that is a significant part of
it is concentrated in a thin surface shell. An interior pressure is exerted by
the strong gravitational field, equivalent to a negative mass. However, the OS
solution has been misunderstood, the shell's position being incorrectly
identified with the ""event horizon"" in black-hole theory. While half the
material is concentrated in a shell occupying a small fraction of the radius,
some material is spread throughout the interior, unlike the concentration in a
black hole's singularity. We deal with the singularity in density at the shell
surface, by including Fermi pressure of degenerate electrons for a shell
density comparable to a solar mass-sized white dwarf. Because the high-density
region is concentrated in a shell, instead of at the centre as in a black hole,
our conclusion is that repulsive gravity enables the existence of supermassive
white dwarfs.

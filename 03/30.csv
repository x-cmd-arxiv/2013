logic ontology in three steps: first, they materialise certain consequences of
the ontology and the data; second, they evaluate the query over the data; and
third, they filter the result of the second phase to eliminate unsound answers.
Such approaches were developed for various members of the DL-Lite and the EL
families of languages, but none of them can handle ontologies containing
nominals. In our work, we bridge this gap and present a combined query
answering approach for ELHO---a logic that contains all features of the OWL 2
EL standard apart from transitive roles and complex role inclusions. This
extension is nontrivial because nominals require equality reasoning, which
introduces complexity into the first and the third step. Our empirical
evaluation suggests that our technique is suitable for practical application,
and so it provides a practical basis for conjunctive query answering in a large
fragment of OWL 2 EL.

model the radial stellar migration in the Galactic disk with an analytical

influence of radial stellar migration on the chemical evolution of the Milky
Way, especially for the abundance gradients. We found that the radial stellar
migration in the Galactic disk can make the profile of the G-dwarf metallicity
distribution of the solar neighborhood taller and narrower, thus it becomes
another solution to the ""G-dwarf problem"". It can also scatter the
age-metallicity relation. However, after the migration, the abundance
distributions along the Galactic radius don't change much, namely the abundance
gradients would not be flattened by the radial stellar migration, which is
different from the predictions of many theoretical works. But it can flatten
the radial gradients of the mean chemical abundance of stars, and older stars
possess flatter abundance gradients than younger stars. The most significant
effect of the radial stellar migration on the chemical abundance is that at a
position it scatters the abundance of stars there from a relatively
concentrated value to a range.

  conf",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  The exploitation of interference in a constructive manner has recently been
proposed for the downlink of multiuser, multi-antenna transmitters. This novel
linear precoding technique, herein referred to as constructive interference
zero forcing (CIZF) precoding, has exhibited substantial gains over
conventional approaches; the concept is to cancel, on a symbol-by-symbol basis,
only the interfering users that do not add to the intended signal power. In
this paper, the power allocation problem towards maximizing the performance of
a CIZF system with respect to some metric (throughput or fairness) is
investigated. What is more, it is shown that the performance of the novel
precoding scheme can be further boosted by choosing some of the constructive
multiuser interference terms in the precoder design. Finally, motivated by the
significant effect of user selection on conventional, zero forcing (ZF)
precoding, the problem of user selection for the novel precoding method is
tackled. A new iterative, low complexity algorithm for user selection in CIZF
is developed. Simulation results are provided to display the gains of the
algorithm compared to known user selection approaches.

the plasma of the solar wind. This causes instabilities, which lead to wave
growth at specific resonant wave numbers, especially within shock regions.
These amplified wave modes influence the turbulent scattering process
significantly. In this paper, results of particle transport and scattering in
turbulent plasmas with excited wave modes are presented. The method used is a
hybrid simulation code, which treats the heliospheric turbulence by an
incompressible magnetohydrodynamic approach separately from a kinetic particle
description. Furthermore, a semi-analytical model using quasilinear theory
(QLT) is compared to the numerical results. This paper aims at a more
fundamental understanding and interpretation of the pitch-angle scattering
coefficients. Our calculations show a good agreement of particle simulations
and the QLT for broad-band turbulent spectra; for higher turbulence levels and
particle beam driven plasmas, the QLT approximation gets worse. Especially the
resonance gap at $\mu=0$ poses a well-known problem for QLT for steep
turbulence spectra, whereas test-particle computations show no problems for the
particles to scatter across this region. The reason is that the sharp resonant
wave--particle interactions in QLT are an oversimplification of the broader
resonances in test-particle calculations, which result from nonlinear effects
not included in the QLT. We emphasise the importance of these results for both
numerical simulations and analytical particle transport approaches, especially
the validity of the QLT.

nested, and for sufficiently large repulsive and a range of on-site repulsive
interaction. In addition, when nesting is further suppressed and in presence of
a nearest-neighbor attraction, a triplet time-reversal breaking (p_x +
ip_y)-wave pairing instability emerges, competing with the d_{x2+y2} pairing
state that is known to dominate at fillings just slightly away from half. At

the (p_x +ip_y)-wave superconducting phase dominates in the whole regime of

The optimal force detection sensitivity at zero frequency (DC) is calculated
and we show that one can beat the standard quantum limit by driving the cavity
close to instability. The best sensitivity achievable is limited by mechanical
thermal noise and by optical losses. We also find that the bandwidth where
optimal sensitivity is maintained is proportional to the cavity damping in the

theories is examined including other experiments constraints along with the

considered together. It is shown that under the assumed naturalness criteria
the overall fine tuning is improved for larger values of the scalar mass with
the inclusion of the proton stability constraint. Thus the naturalness criteria
including proton stability along with electroweak symmetry breaking constraints
tend to favor the weak scale of SUSY in the several TeV region. Implications
for the discovery of supersymmetry in view of the high Higgs mass are briefly
discussed.

understood part of the fission process, though the most important for the
formation of the observables. To investigate the potential energy landscape at
the largest possible deformations, i.e. at the scission point (line,
hypersurface), the Strutinsky's optimal shape approach is applied.
  For the accurate description of the mass-asymmetric nuclear shape at the
scission point, it turned out necessary to construct an interpolation between
the two sets of constraints for the elongation and mass asymmetry which are
applied successfully at small deformations (quadrupole and octupole moments)
and for separated fragments (the distance between the centers of mass and the
difference of fragments masses). In addition, a constraint on the neck radius
was added, what makes it possible to introduce the so called super-short and
super-long shapes at the scission point and to consider the contributions to
the observable data from different fission modes. The calculated results for
the mass distribution of the fission fragment and the Coulomb repulsion energy
""immediately after scission"" are in a reasonable agreement with experimental

absorption equivalent width W_r(2796)=4.2\AA\ at z=0.5624. This absorber was
originally found at projected separation \rho=246 kpc of a luminous red galaxy
(LRG) at z=0.5604. Magellan IMACs spectroscopy has revealed two galaxies at
\rho < 60 kpc (z=0.5623 and z=0.5621) and a third one at \rho=209 kpc
(z=0.5623) near the redshift of the absorber.These findings indicate that the
absorbing gas resides in a group environment. Combining SDSS broadband
photometry with additional B-, K_s-band images and optical spectroscopy, we
perform a stellar population synthesis analysis of the group members to
characterize their star formation histories, on-going star formation rates
(SFR), and stellar masses. We find that the two group members at \rho < 60 kpc
are best characterized by old stellar populations (>1 Gyr) and little on-going
star formation activity (SFR<2.9 \msun/yr), while the third object at \rho=209
kpc exhibit [OII]- and continuum-derived SFR consistent with SFR>3.0 \msun/yr.
Including the two ultra-strong MgII absorbers analyzed by Nestor et al. (2011),
this is the third ultra-strong MgII absorber for which a detailed study of the
galactic environment is available. All three aborbers are found in galaxy
groups. We examine different physical mechanisms giving rise to the absorbing
gas including starburst driven-outflows, cold filaments, extended rotating
disks, and stripped gas. We argue that the large equivalent width observed in
these absorbers is more likely due to the gas dynamics of the intragroup medium

that the same coupling between the chameleon field and matter employed by the
screening mechanism also has catastrophic consequences for the chameleon during
the Universe's first minutes. The chameleon couples to the trace of the
stress-energy tensor, which is temporarily non-zero in a radiation-dominated
universe whenever a particle species becomes non-relativistic. These ""kicks""
impart a significant velocity to the chameleon field, causing its effective
mass to vary non-adiabatically and resulting in the copious production of
quantum fluctuations. Dissipative effects strongly modify the background
evolution of the chameleon field, invalidating all previous classical
treatments of chameleon cosmology. Moreover, the resulting fluctuations have
extremely high characteristic energies, which casts serious doubt on the
validity of the effective theory. Our results demonstrate that quantum particle
production can profoundly affect scalar-tensor gravity, a possibility not
previously considered. Working in this new context, we also develop the theory

performance. Zero-copy operations, as the name implies, avoid copying buffers
for sending and receiving data. Instead, hardware devices directly read and
write to application specified areas of memory. Since these networks can send
and receive at nearly the same speed as the memory bus inside machines,
zero-copy operations are necessary to achieve peak performance for many
applications.
  Unfortunately, programming with zero-copy APIs is a *giant pain*. Users must
carefully avoid using buffers that may be accessed by a device. Typically this
either results in spaghetti code (where every access to a buffer is checked
before usage), or blocking operations (which pretty much defeat the whole point

for these algebras. In the third part of this paper (Section 5) we consider
some varieties of many-sorted algebras. We prove that automorphic equivalence
coincide with geometric equivalence in the variety of the all actions of
semigroups over sets and in the variety of the all automatons. We also consider
the variety of the all representations of groups and the all representations of
Lie algebras. For both these varieties we give an examples of the
representations which are automorphically equivalent but not geometrically
equivalent.

leading to a tractable probabilistic generative model that can be used to model
simple-cell receptive-field profiles, or generate basis functions for sparse
coding applications. Learning is found to be most pronounced in three
Gabor-function parameters representing the size and spatial frequency of the
two-dimensional Gabor function, and characterized by a non-uniform probability
distribution with heavy tails. All three parameters are found to be strongly
correlated: resulting in a basis of multiscale Gabor functions with similar
aspect ratios, and size-dependent spatial frequencies. A key finding is that
the distribution of receptive-field sizes is scale-invariant over a wide range
of values, so there is no characteristic receptive-field size selected by
natural image statistics. The Gabor-function aspect ratio is found to be
approximately conserved by the learning rules and is therefore not
well-determined by natural image statistics. This allows for three distinct
solutions: a basis of Gabor functions with sharp orientation resolution at the
expense of spatial-frequency resolution; a basis of Gabor functions with sharp
spatial-frequency resolution at the expense of orientation resolution; or a
basis with unit aspect ratio. Arbitrary mixtures of all three cases are also
possible. Two parameters controlling the shape of the marginal distributions in
a probabilistic generative model fully account for all three solutions. The
best-performing probabilistic generative model for sparse coding applications
is found to be a Gaussian copula with Pareto marginal probability density
functions.

and a linear form in N real variables over (N-1)- dimensional sphere is one of
the simplest, yet paradigmatic problems in Optimization Theory known as the
""trust region subproblem"" or ""constraint least square problem"". When both terms
in the cost function are random this amounts to studying the ground state
energy of the simplest spherical spin glass in a random magnetic field. We
first identify and study two distinct large-N scaling regimes in which the
linear term (magnetic field) leads to a gradual topology trivialization, i.e.
reduction in the total number N_{tot} of critical (stationary) points in the
cost function landscape. In the first regime N_{tot} remains of the order $N$
and the cost function (energy) has generically two almost degenerate minima
with the Tracy-Widom (TW) statistics. In the second regime the number of
critical points is of the order of unity with a finite probability for a single
minimum. In that case the mean total number of extrema (minima and maxima) of
the cost function is given by the Laplace transform of the TW density, and the
distribution of the global minimum energy is expected to take a universal
scaling form generalizing the TW law. Though the full form of that distribution
is not yet known to us, one of its far tails can be inferred from the large
deviation theory for the global minimum. In the rest of the paper we show how
to use the replica method to obtain the probability density of the minimum
energy in the large-deviation approximation by finding both the rate function
and the leading pre-exponential factor.

Unfortunately, Wang's original simulation algorithm suffers from an exponential

efficiently simulates Turing machines in polynomial time. Thus, Hasenjaeger's
machine is both small and fast. In another application of our result, we show

variable $X$, the problem of estimating its expected value $\mu$ is addressed.
The standard approach is to use the sample mean as an estimator $\bar x$. In
importance sampling, a suitable variable $L$ is introduced such that the random
variable $X/L$ has an estimator with a smaller variance than that of $\bar x$.
As a result, a smaller sample size can lead to the same estimation accuracy.
  In the simulation of reinsurance financial terms for catastrophe loss,
choosing a general variable $L$ is difficult: Even before the application of
financial terms, the loss distribution is often not modelled by a closed-form
distribution. After that, a wide range of financial terms can be applied that
makes the final distribution unpredictable. However, it is evident that the
heavy tail of the resulting net loss distribution makes the use of importance
sampling desirable. We propose an importance sampling technique using a power
function transformation on the cumulative distribution function. The benefit of
this technique is that no prior knowledge of the loss distribution is required.
It is a new technique that has not been documented in the literature. The
transformation depends on the choice of the exponent $k$. For a specific
example we investigate desirable values of $k$.

theoretical analyses. A rather sharp increase in the values of isobaric
specific heat with lowering temperature and the weak temperature dependence of
isochoric specific heat in the same range are reproduced in simulations. We
calculated the spatiotemporal correlation among temperature fluctuations and
examined the frequency dependent specific heat. The latter shows a rapid growth
in the low frequency regime as temperature is cooled below 270 K. In order to
understand the microscopic basis of this increase, we have performed a shell
wise decomposition of contributions of distant molecules to the temperature
fluctuations in a central molecule. This decomposition reveals the emergence,
at low temperatures, of temporally slow, spatially long ranged large
temperature fluctuations. The temperature fluctuation time correlation function
(TFCF) can be fitted to a William-Watts stretched exponential form with the
stretching parameter close to 0.6 at low temperatures, indicating highly
non-exponential relaxation. Temperature dependence of the relaxation time of
the correlation function can be fitted to Vogel-Fulcher-Tamermann expression
which provides a quantitative measure of the fragility of the liquid.
Interestingly, we find that the rapid growth in the relaxation time of TFCF
with lowering temperature undergoes a sharp crossover from a markedly fragile

present a combinatorial proof of the inversion formula on $R$-polynomials due
to Kazhdan and Lusztig. This problem was raised by Brenti. Based on Dyer's
combinatorial interpretation of the $R$-polynomials in terms of increasing
Bruhat paths, we reformulate the inversion formula in terms of $V$-paths. By a
$V$-path from $u$ to $v$ with bottom $w$ we mean a pair $(\Delta_1,\Delta_2)$
of Bruhat paths such that $\Delta_1$ is a decreasing path from $u$ to $w$ and
$\Delta_2$ is an increasing path from $w$ to $v$. We find a reflection
principle on $V$-paths, which leads to a combinatorial proof of the inversion
formula. Moreover, we give two applications of the reflection principle. First,
we restrict this involution to $V$-paths from $u$ to $v$ with maximal length.
This provides a direct interpretation for the equi-distribution property that
any nontrivial interval $[u,v]$ has as many elements of even length as elements
of odd length. This property was obtained by Verma in his derivation of the
M\""obius function of the Bruhat order. Second, using the reflection principle
for the symmetric group, we obtain a refinement of the inversion formula by
restricting the summation to permutations ending with a given element.

characterized by an appropriate signature of future reproduction success. In
the supercritical case a natural choice is to look for the lineages that
survive forever. In the critical case it was earlier suggested to distinguish
the particles with the total number of descendants exceeding a certain
threshold. These two definitions lead to asymptotic representations of the
skeletons as either pure birth process (in the slightly supercritical case) or
critical birth-death processes (in the critical case conditioned on the total
number of particles exceeding a high threshold value). The limit skeletons
reveal typical survival scenarios for the underlying branching processes.
  In this paper we consider near-critical Bienaym\'{e}-Galton-Watson processes
and define their skeletons using marking of particles. If marking is rare, such
skeletons are approximated by birth and death processes which can be
subcritical, critical or supercritical. We obtain the limit skeleton for a
sequential mutation model and compute the density distribution function for the

the structures appearing in the electronic self-energy are connected to the
existence of packets of correlated electron/phonon states. These states appear
in the spectral functions even at $T=0\,K$, revealing the key role played by
the zero point motion effect. We give a physical interpretation of these states
by disclosing their internal composition by mapping the Many Body problem to

to that prediction, in a recent experimental work T\""onshoff and Bettinger [

low-lying excited states of long acenes, with an emphasis on the
singlet-triplet gap, starting from naphthalene, all the way up to decacene.
Methodology adopted in our work is based upon Pariser-Parr-Pople model (PPP)
Hamiltonian, along with large-scale multi-reference singles-doubles

though the singlet-triplet gap decreases with the increasing conjugation
length, nevertheless, it remains finite till decacene, thus providing no
evidence of the predicted singlet-triplet crossover. We also analyze the nature
of many-particle wavefunction of the correlated singlet ground state and find
that the longer acenes exhibit tendency towards a open-shell singlet ground
state. Moreover, when we compare the experimental absorption spectra of
octacene and nonacene with their calculated singlet and triplet absorption
spectra, we observe excellent agreement for the singlet case. Hence, the
optical absorption results also confirm the singlet nature of the ground state
for longer acenes.

Analysis Workshops (CDAWs) held in 2010 (20 - 23 September in Dan Diego,
California, USA) and 2011 (September 5-9 in Alcala, Spain). The primary purpose
of the CDAWs was to address the question: Do all CMEs have flux rope structure?

with nanometer precision is demonstrated. Unlike conventional dual-wavelength
metrology which employs heterodyne detection, the method developed in this work
utilizes direct detection of interference fringes of two He-Ne lasers as well
as a less precise stepper motor open-loop position control system to perform
its measurement. Although the method may be applicable to a variety of
circumstances, the specific application where this metrology is essential is in
an astrometric optical long baseline stellar interferometer dedicated to
precise measurement of stellar positions. In our example application of this
metrology to a narrow-angle astrometric interferometer, measurement of
nanometer precision could be achieved without frequency-stabilized lasers
although the use of such lasers would extend the range of optical path length
the metrology can accurately measure. Implementation of the method requires
very little additional optics or electronics, thus minimizing cost and effort
of implementation. Furthermore, the optical path traversed by the metrology
lasers is identical with that of the starlight or science beams, even down to
using the same photodetectors, thereby minimizing the non-common-path between
metrology and science channels.

and the charge states observed within CMEs arriving at Earth. The model
involving magnetic loop expansion to explain CMEs without flux ropes is not
viable because it contradicts CME kinematics and flare properties near the Sun.
The flux rope is fast, it drives a shock, so the global picture of CMEs becomes
complete if one includes the shock sheath to the CSHKP model.

synaptic plasticity rule that acts beyond conventional pair-based STDP (PSTDP).
Here, the TSTDP is capable of reproducing the outcomes from a variety of
biological experiments, while the PSTDP rule fails to reproduce them.
Additionally, it has been shown that the behaviour inherent to the spike
rate-based Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro (BCM) synaptic plasticity rule can also
emerge from the TSTDP rule. This paper proposes an analog implementation of the
TSTDP rule. The proposed VLSI circuit has been designed using the AMS 0.35 um
CMOS process and has been simulated using design kits for Synopsys and Cadence
tools. Simulation results demonstrate how well the proposed circuit can alter
synaptic weights according to the timing difference amongst a set of different
patterns of spikes. Furthermore, the circuit is shown to give rise to a
BCM-like learning rule, which is a rate-based rule. To mimic implementation
environment, a 1000 run Monte Carlo (MC) analysis was conducted on the proposed
circuit. The presented MC simulation analysis and the simulation result from
fine-tuned circuits show that, it is possible to mitigate the effect of process
variations in the proof of concept circuit, however, a practical variation
aware design technique is required to promise a high circuit performance in a
large scale neural network. We believe that the proposed design can play a
significant role in future VLSI implementations of both spike timing and rate
based neuromorphic learning systems.

conspicuous SN Ib-like He I lines and other absorption features at velocities
reaching 2 x 10^4 km/s in its early spectra, and a broad light curve that
peaked at M_B = -18.1 mag. Models of these data indicate a large explosion
kinetic energy of 10^{52} erg and 56Ni mass ejection of 0.3 Msolar on par with
SN 1998bw. SN 2012au's spectra almost one year after explosion show a blend of
persistent Fe II P-Cyg absorptions and nebular emissions originating from two
distinct velocity regions. These late-time emissions include strong [Fe II],
[Ca II], [O I], Mg I], and Na I lines at velocities > 4500 km/s, as well as O I
and Mg I lines at noticeably smaller velocities of 2000 km/s. Many of the
late-time properties of SN 2012au are similar to the slow-evolving hypernovae
SN 1997dq and SN 1997ef, and the superluminous SN 2007bi. Our observations
suggest that a single explosion mechanism may unify all of these events that
span -21 < M_B < -17 mag. The aspherical and possibly jetted explosion was most
likely initiated by the core collapse of a massive progenitor star and created
substantial high-density, low-velocity Ni-rich material.

revealed by a phase-field theory that includes surface energy, chemical
reactions and coherency strain. In contrast to binary fluids, which form
arbitrary contact angles at surfaces, complete ""wetting"" by one phase is
favored at binary solid surfaces. Nucleation occurs when surface wetting
becomes unstable, as the chemical energy gain (scaling with area) overcomes the
elastic energy penalty (scaling with volume). The nucleation barrier thus
decreases with the area-to-volume ratio and vanishes below a critical size, and
nanoparticles tend to transform in order of increasing size, leaving the
smallest particles homogeneous (in the phase of lowest surface energy). The
model is used to simulate phase separation in realistic nanoparticle geometries
for \ce{Li_XFePO4}, a popular cathode material for Li-ion batteries, and
collapses disparate experimental data for the nucleation barrier, with no
adjustable parameters. Beyond energy storage, the theory generally shows how to
tailor the elastic and surface properties of a solid nanostructure to achieve
desired phase behavior.

species is of fundamental importance to the study of evolution. In the fields
of population and evolutionary genetics, measures of genetic differentiation
are commonly used to gather this information. One potential caveat is that
these measures assume gene flow to be symmetric. However, asymmetric gene flow
is common in nature, especially in systems driven by physical processes such as
wind or water currents. Since information about levels of asymmetric gene flow
among populations is essential for the correct interpretation of the
distribution of contemporary genetic diversity within species, this should not
be overlooked. To obtain information on asymmetric migration patterns from
genetic data, complex models based on maximum likelihood or Bayesian approaches
generally need to be employed, often at great computational cost. Here, a new
simpler and more efficient approach for understanding gene flow patterns is
presented. This approach allows the estimation of directional components of
genetic divergence between pairs of populations at low computational effort,
using any of the classical or modern measures of genetic differentiation. These
directional measures of genetic differentiation can further be used to
calculate directional relative migration and to detect asymmetries in gene flow
patterns. This can be done in a user-friendly web application called
divMigrate-online introduced in this paper. Using simulated data sets with
known gene flow regimes, we demonstrate that the method is capable of resolving
complex migration patterns under a range of study designs.

dynamics of molecules in an artificial chemistry where large molecules can be

contains a large number of spontaneous reactions of which a small subset could
be catalyzed by molecules produced in the chemistry with varying catalytic
strengths. We show ACSs, if present in the catalytic network, can focus the
resources of the system into a sparse set of molecules. ACSs can produce a
bistability in the population dynamics and, in particular, steady states
wherein the ACS molecules dominate the population, i.e., have higher
concentrations compared to the rest of molecules in the chemistry (background).
In this thesis we attempt to address two main questions: First, under what
circumstances do molecules belonging to the ACSs dominate over the background,
and second, starting from an initial condition that does not contain good
catalysts, can a sparse set of large molecules (containing several tens or a
few hundred monomers) that are good catalysts arise and be maintained in the
system at concentrations significantly above the background? We show that if an
ACS catalyzed by large molecules contains within it (or partially overlaps
with) a smaller ACS catalyzed by smaller molecules (referred to as a `nested
ACS' structure), the catalytic strength required for the large ACS to dominate
comes down significantly. We show that when the network contains a cascade of
nested ACSs with the catalytic strengths of molecules increasing gradually with
their size, a sparse subset of molecules including some very large molecules
can come to dominate the system.

rotation than in any other degree of freedom are known as ""super rotors"". It
has been speculated that super rotors may exhibit a number of unique
properties. Theoretical studies showed that ultrafast molecular rotation may
change the character of molecular scattering from solid surfaces, alter
molecular trajectories in external fields, make super rotors stable against
collisions, and lead to the formation of gas vortices. New ways of molecular
cooling and selective chemical bond breaking by ultrafast spinning have been
suggested. Bringing a large number of molecules to fast, directional and
synchronous rotation is rather challenging. An efficient method of accelerating
molecular rotation with an ""optical centrifuge"" has been proposed and
successfully implemented, yet only indirect evidence of super rotors has been
reported to date. Here we demonstrate the first direct observation of molecular
super rotors and study their spectroscopic, dynamical and magneto-optical
properties. Using the centrifuge technique, we control the degree of rotational
excitation and detect molecular rotation with high spectral and temporal
resolution. Frequency-resolved detection enables us to map out the energy of
extreme rotation levels, two orders of magnitude above the room temperature
limit, and quantify the onset of the centrifugal distortion. Femtosecond time
resolution reveals highly coherent rotational dynamics with lower de-coherence
rates at higher values of the molecular angular momentum, and the increase of
the molecular moment of inertia due to the rotation-induced chemical bond
stretching. In the presence of an external magnetic field, ultrafast molecular
rotation is found to result in an optical birefringence of the molecular
ensemble.

determine the lifetime broadening of excitonic peaks and the indirect

layer of electrically-conducting fluid produces a significant alpha-effect,
which is one of the key ingredients in any mean-field dynamo model. Provided
that this alpha-effect operates more efficiently than (turbulent) magnetic
diffusion, such a system should be capable of sustaining a large-scale dynamo.
However, in the Boussinesq model that was considered by Cattaneo&Hughes (2006)
the dynamo produced small-scale, intermittent magnetic fields with no
significant large-scale component. In this paper, we consider the compressible
analogue of the rotating convective layer that was considered by
Cattaneo&Hughes (2006). Varying the horizontal scale of the computational
domain, we investigate the dependence of the dynamo upon the rotation rate. Our
simulations indicate that these turbulent compressible flows can drive a
small-scale dynamo but, even when the layer is rotating very rapidly (with a
mid-layer Taylor number of Ta=10^8), we find no evidence for the generation of
a significant large-scale component of the magnetic field on a dynamical
timescale. Like Cattaneo&Hughes(2006), we measure a negligible (time-averaged)
alpha-effect when a uniform horizontal magnetic field is imposed across the
computational domain. Although the total horizontal magnetic flux is a
conserved quantity in these simulations, the (depth-dependent)
horizontally-averaged magnetic field always exhibits strong fluctuations. If
these fluctuations are artificially suppressed within the code, we measure a
significant mean electromotive force that is comparable to that found in
related calculations in which the alpha-effect is measured using the test-field
method, even though we observe no large-scale dynamo action.

Peierls transition from symmetric cumulene to broken-symmetry polyyne structure
is enhanced as the material is stretched. Interpretation within a simple and
instructive analytical model suggests that this behavior is valid for arbitrary
1D metals. Further, numerical calculations of the anharmonic quantum
vibrational structure of carbyne show that zero-point atomic vibrations alone
eliminate the Peierls distortion in a mechanically free chain, preserving the
cumulene symmetry. The emergence and increase of Peierls dimerization under
tension then implies a qualitative transition between the two forms, which our
computations place around 3% strain. Thus, zero-point vibrations and mechanical
strain jointly produce a change in symmetry resulting in the transition from
metallic to insulating state. In any practical realization, it is important
that the effect is also chemically modulated by the choice of terminating
groups. Our findings are promising for applications such as electromechanical
switching and band gap tuning via strain, and besides carbyne itself, they
directly extend to numerous other systems that show Peierls distortion.

cm^{-3}). Although the planetary radius is about 10% smaller than that reported
by Demory et al., this difference does not alter their conclusion that the
planet possesses a hydrogen-rich envelope whose mass is approximately 10% of
the planetary total mass. On the other hand, we find that the planet-to-star
radius ratio (R_p/R_s) in the J band (0.07577^{+0.00072}_{-0.00075}) is smaller
than that in the I_c (0.0802 \pm 0.0013) and 4.5-micron

atmospheric opacity varies with wavelength due to absorption and/or scattering
by atmospheric molecules. Although the significance of the observed R_p/R_s
variations is low, if confirmed, this fact would suggest that GJ3470b does not
have a thick cloud layer in the atmosphere. This property would offer a wealth

introduced recently and studied in the low load regime, where the number $P$ of
simultaneously retrievable patterns scales with the number $N$ of nodes as
$P\sim \log N$. In addition to their relevance in artificial intelligence,
these models are increasingly important in immunology, where stored patterns
represent strategies to fight pathogens and nodes represent lymphocyte clones.
They allow us to understand the crucial ability of the immune system to respond
simultaneously to multiple distinct antigen invasions. Here we develop further
the statistical mechanical analysis of such systems, by studying the medium
load regime, $P \sim N^{\delta}$ with $\delta \in (0,1]$. We derive three main
results. First, we reveal the nontrivial architecture of these networks: they
exhibit a high degree of modularity and clustering, which is linked to their
retrieval abilities. Second, by solving the model we demonstrate for $\delta<1$
the existence of large regions in the phase diagram where the network can
retrieve all stored patterns simultaneously. Finally, in the high load regime
$\delta=1$ we find that the system behaves as a spin glass, suggesting that
finite-connectivity frameworks are required to achieve effective retrieval.

the low scale of the inverse seesaw mechanism. Among the observables
considered, we find that the most constraining one is the muon to electron
conversion rate which is already restricting the otherwise allowed parameter

non-decoupling behaviour, which has previously been noticed in lepton flavour

Interference mitigation techniques relying on multiple antennas and

Typical strategies in OFDMA networks include coordinated scheduling,
beamforming and power control. In this paper, we propose a novel and practical
type of coordination for OFDMA downlink networks relying on multiple antennas
at the transmitter and the receiver. The transmission ranks, i.e.\ the number
of transmitted streams, and the user scheduling in all cells are jointly
optimized in order to maximize a network utility function accounting for
fairness among users. A distributed coordinated scheduler motivated by an
interference pricing mechanism and relying on a master-slave architecture is
introduced. The proposed scheme is operated based on the user report of a
recommended rank for the interfering cells accounting for the receiver
interference suppression capability. It incurs a very low feedback and backhaul
overhead and enables efficient link adaptation. It is moreover robust to
channel measurement errors and applicable to both open-loop and closed-loop
MIMO operations. A 20% cell edge performance gain over uncoordinated LTE-A

despite differences in expected false detection rates, fill-factor loss and
relatively sparse observing cadence compared to a hypothetical Pan-STARRS4
telescope and survey. MOPS remains >99.5% efficient at detecting objects on a
single night but drops to 80% efficiency at producing orbits for objects
detected on multiple nights. This loss is primarily due to configurable MOPS
processing limits that are not yet tuned for the Pan-STARRS1 mission.
  The core MOPS software package is the product of more than 15 person-years of
software development and incorporates countless additional years of effort in
third-party software to perform lower-level functions such as spatial searching
or orbit determination. We describe the high-level design of MOPS and essential
subcomponents, the suitability of MOPS for other survey programs, and suggest a
road map for future MOPS development.

matrix factorization (NMF). The proposed algorithm can be used for denoising or
single-channel source separation (SCSS) applications. The NMF solution is
guided to follow the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimates under Gaussian
mixture prior models (GMM) for the source signal. In SCSS applications, the
spectra of the observed mixed signal are decomposed as a weighted linear
combination of trained basis vectors for each source using NMF. In this work,
the NMF decomposition weight matrices are treated as a distorted image by a
distortion operator, which is learned directly from the observed signals. The
MMSE estimate of the weights matrix under GMM prior and log-normal distribution
for the distortion is then found to improve the NMF decomposition results. The
MMSE estimate is embedded within the optimization objective to form a novel
regularized NMF cost function. The corresponding update rules for the new
objectives are derived in this paper. Experimental results show that, the
proposed regularized NMF algorithm improves the source separation performance
compared with using NMF without prior or with other prior models.

clusters (GGC) where data exist. However, observations alone cannot reveal the
relative importance of various formation channels or the typical formation
times for this well studied population of anomalous stars. Using a
state-of-the-art H\'enon-type Monte Carlo code that includes all relevant
physical processes, we create 128 models with properties typical of the
observed GGCs. These models include realistic numbers of single and binary
stars, use observationally motivated initial conditions, and span large ranges
in central density, concentration, binary fraction, and mass. Their properties
can be directly compared with those of observed GGCs. We can easily identify
the BSSs in our models and determine their formation channels and birth times.
We find that for central densities above ~10^3 Msun/pc^3 the dominant formation
channel is stellar collisions while for lower density clusters, mass transfer
in binaries provides a significant contribution (up to ~ 60% in our models).
The majority of these collisions are binary-mediated, occurring during 3-body
and 4-body interactions. As a result a strong correlation between the specific
frequency of BSSs and the binary fraction in a cluster can be seen in our
models. We find that the number of BSSs in the core shows only a weak
correlation with the collision rate estimator \Gamma traditionally used by
observers, in agreement with the latest Hubble Space Telescope (ACS) data.
Using an idealized ""full mixing"" prescription for collision products, our
models indicate that the BSSs observed today may have formed several Gyrs ago.
However, denser clusters tend to have younger (~1 Gyr) BSSs.

us to shift the energy level of specific atomic orbital, therefore is helpful

result in structural instabilities of Sn and Pb monochalcogenides.

recently introduced in [Commun. Math. Phys., DOI 10.1007/s00220-012-1645-2]
(see also arXiv:1202.3903) taking the initial state as an absorbing one. We
extend this notion of monitored recurrence to absorbing subspaces of arbitrary
finite dimension.
  The generating function approach leads to a connection with the well-known
theory of operator-valued Schur functions. This is the cornerstone of a
spectral characterization of subspace recurrence that generalizes some of the
main results in the above mentioned paper. The spectral decomposition of the
unitary step operator driving the evolution yields a spectral measure, which we
project onto the subspace to obtain a new spectral measure that is purely
singular iff the subspace is recurrent, and consists of a pure point spectrum
with a finite number of masses precisely when all states in the subspace have a
finite expected return time.
  This notion of subspace recurrence also links the concept of expected return
time to an Aharonov-Anandan phase that, in contrast to the case of state
recurrence, can be non-integer. Even more surprising is the fact that averaging
such geometrical phases over the absorbing subspace yields an integer with a
topological meaning, so that the averaged expected return time is always a
rational number. Moreover, state recurrence can occasionally give higher return
probabilities than subspace recurrence, a fact that reveals once more the
counterintuitive behavior of quantum systems.
  All these phenomena are illustrated with explicit examples, including as a
natural application the analysis of site recurrence for coined walks.

problems in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). They are based on algebraic
objects, such as Cech complex and Rips complex. Cech complex gives accurate
information about coverage quality but requires a precise knowledge of the

implement in practical deployments. Rips complex provides an approximation of
Cech complex. It is easier to build and does not require any knowledge of nodes
location. This simplicity is at the expense of accuracy. Rips complex can not
always detect all coverage holes. It is then necessary to evaluate its
accuracy. This work proposes to use the proportion of the area of undiscovered
coverage holes as performance criteria. Investigations show that it depends on
the ratio between communication and sensing radii of a sensor. Closed-form
expressions for lower and upper bounds of the accuracy are also derived. For
those coverage holes which can be discovered by Rips complex, a homology-based

consistent with the proposed analytical lower bound, with a maximum difference
of 0.5%. Upper bound performance depends on the ratio of communication and

labelled by the symmetry (xy, xz, or yz) of the Ti d-orbitals from which they
mainly derive. The xy-derived band nearest the interface contains the major

slightly occupied xy-derived bands are also found. Depending on the magnitude

long-distance tail of the interface charge. The response to applied ac electric
fields polarized parallel and perpendicular to the interface is calculated and
the results are presented in terms of ellipsometry angles. Two features are
found: a dip in the spectrum near the LO feature of the STO phonon and a peak
at the higher energy. We show that the form and magnitude of the dip is related

the peak arises from the plasmon excitation of the xz and yz electrons. The

eigenvalue estimates, which may be expensive and cumbersome to come by. Here we
show how such eigenvalue estimates can be extracted from the recursive
expansion by a simple and robust procedure at a negligible computational cost.
Our method is illustrated with density functional tight-binding
Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations, where the computational effort
is dominated by the density matrix construction. In our analysis we identify
two different phases of the recursive polynomial expansion, the conditioning

improvement of the conditioning phase, which typically gives a significant
reduction of the computational cost.

$d=p_1^{b_1}\cdots p_k^{b_k} $ is called a divisor of order $r$ of
$n=p_1^{a_1}\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ if $d \mid n$ and $b_j\in\{r, a_j\}$ for
$j=1,\ldots,k$. One can consider respective divisor function $\tau^{(r)}$ and
sum-of-divisors function $\sigma^{(r)}$.
  In the present paper we investigate the asymptotic behaviour of $\sum_{n\le
x} \tau^{(r)}(n)$ and $\sum_{n\le x} \sigma^{(r)}(n)$. We also provide
conditional estimates under Riemann hypothesis.

new way of modelling evolutionary game models with an emphasis on ecological
realism, concerned with how ecological factors determine payoffs in
evolutionary games. The current paper is focused on the impact of selectively
neutral factors (i.e. those that are the same for all strategies), such as
background fitness and a neutral density dependence on game dynamics. In the
previous paper background mortality was modelled by post-reproductive mortality
describing aggregated mortality between game interactions. In this paper a
novel approach to the modelling of background fitness, based on different
occurrence rates (intensities) of game interactions and background events is
presented. It is shown that the new method is more realistic and natural for
dynamic models than the method used in the previous paper. The previous method
in effect produces biased trajectories, but it is compatible with the new
approach at the restpoints. Also in this paper a rigorous stability analysis of
the restpoints of the dynamics is presented. It is shown that the stability or
instability of the restpoints, can be explained by a mechanism of
eco-evolutionary feedback. The results obtained are illustrated by a Hawk-Dove
game example.

between molecular symmetry and the symmetry of the spin Hamiltonian that
dictates QTM selection rules. Higher order interactions that can modify the
usual selection rules are shown to be very sensitive to the exchange strength.
In the strong coupling limit, the spin Hamiltonian possess rigorous $D_{2h}$
symmetry (or $C_{\infty}$ in high-symmetry cases). In the case of weaker
exchange, additional symmetries may emerge through mixing of excited spin
states into the ground state. Group theoretic arguments are introduced to
support these ideas, as are extensive results of magnetization hysteresis and

factor {\Gamma} = 10, 30, and 100. The instability generates turbulence whose
scale exhibits strong dependence on Lorentz factor, as only modes with angular
size smaller than 1/{\Gamma} can grow. We develop a simple diagnostic to
measure the kinetic energy in turbulent fluctuations, and calculate a ratio of
turbulent kinetic energy to thermal energy of .03 in the region affected by the
instability. Although our numerical calculation does not include magnetic
fields, we argue that small scale turbulent dynamo amplifies magnetic fields to
nearly this same fraction, giving a ratio of magnetic to thermal energy of ~
.01, to within a factor of two. The instability completely disrupts the contact
discontinuity between the ejecta and the swept up circumburst medium. The
reverse shock is stable, but is impacted by the Rayleigh-Taylor instability,
which strengthens the reverse shock and pushes it away from the forward shock.
The forward shock front is unaffected by the instability, but Rayleigh-Taylor
fingers can penetrate of order 10% of the way into the energetic region behind
the shock during the two-shock phase of the explosion. We calculate afterglow
emission from the explosion and find the reverse shock emission peaks at a
later time due to its reduced Lorentz factor and modified density and pressure
at the shock front. These calculations are performed using a novel numerical
technique that includes a moving computational grid. The moving grid is
essential as it maintains contact discontinuities to high precision and can
easily evolve flows with extremely large Lorentz factors.

and planetary interiors. To follow the slow evolution of subsonic motions,
various sound-proof models attempt to remove fast acoustic waves whilst
retaining stratified convection and buoyancy dynamics. In astrophysics,
anelastic models typically receive the most attention in the class of
sound-filtered stratified models. Generally, anelastic models remain valid in
nearly adiabatically stratified regions like stellar convection zones, but may
break down in strongly sub-adiabatic, stably stratified layers common in
stellar radiative zones. However, studying stellar rotation, circulation, and
dynamos requires understanding the complex coupling between convection and
radiative zones, and this requires robust equations valid in both regimes. Here
we extend the analysis of equation sets begun in Brown Vasil & Zweibel 2012,
which studied anelastic models, to two types of pseudo-incompressible models.
This class of models has received attention in atmospheric applications, and
more recently in studies of white-dwarf supernovae progenitors. We demonstrate
that one model conserves energy but the other does not. We use Lagrangian
variational methods to extend the energy conserving model to a general equation
of state, and dub the resulting equation set the Generalized
Pseudo-Incompressible (GPI) model. We show that the GPI equations suitably
capture low frequency phenomena in both convection and radiative zones in stars
and other stratified systems, and we provide recommendations for converting
low-Mach number codes to this equation set.

larger than those of Halpha by factors ranging from 1 to 3.6, with an average

of the Lya light is pushed to large radii by resonance scattering. Defining the
""Relative Petrosian Extension"" of Lya compared to Halpha, \xi_ext = RP20_Lya /
RP20_Ha, we find \xi_ext to be uncorrelated with total Lya luminosity. However
\xi_ext is strongly correlated with quantities that scale with dust content, in
the sense that a low dust abundance is a necessary requirement (although not
the only one) in order to spread Lya photons throughout the interstellar medium

modified gravity on the matter power spectrum and mass function, and found a
rich and interesting phenomenology where the difference with the LCDM paradigm
cannot be reproduced by a linear analysis even on scales as large as

gravity depends only on the background matter density. Our results show that
the chameleon screening mechanism is significantly more efficient than other
mechanisms such as the dilaton and symmetron, especially in high-density
regions and at early times, and can serve as a guidance to determine the parts
of the chameleon parameter space which are cosmologically interesting and thus
merit further studies in the future.

canonical Eddington limit for hydrogen gas. Previous results from the Swift/BAT
9-month catalogue suggested that in the overwhelming majority of local AGN, the
dusty absorbing gas is below this Effective Eddington limit, implying that
radiation pressure is insufficient to blow away the absorbing clouds. We
present an analysis of three objects from that sample which were found to be
close to the Effective Eddington limit (NGC454, 2MASX J03565655-4041453 and XSS
J05054-2348), using newly obtained XMM-Newton data. We use the X-ray data to
better constrain the absorbing column density, and supplement them with XMM
optical monitor (OM) data, infrared Spitzer and Herschel data where available
to construct a broad-band spectral energy distribution to estimate refined
bolometric luminosities and Eddington ratios for these three objects. The new
XMM-Newton observations show all three objects moving away from the region
expected for short-lived absorption in the N_H-\lambda_{Edd} plane into the
`long-lived absorption' region. We find our conclusions robust to different
methods for estimating the bolometric luminosity and Eddington ratio.
Interestingly, 2MASX J03565655-4041453 and XSS J05054-2348 now exhibit complex
X-ray spectra, at variance with previous analyses of their Swift/XRT data. We
find evidence for absorption variability in NGC 454 and 2MASX
J03565655-4041453, perhaps implying that although the radiation pressure from
the central engine is insufficient to cause clearly detectable outflows, it may
cause absorption variations over longer timescales. However, more robust black
hole mass estimates would improve the accuracy of the Eddington ratio estimates
for these objects.

cm^-3) exposed to the extra-galactic background (EGB) and initially in thermal
equilibrium (T \sim 10^4-10^4.5 K). Once the proximate AGN field turns on,
additional photo-ionisation rapidly ionises the HI and metals. The enhanced AGN
radiation field turns off after a typical AGN lifetime (tau_AGN=1-20 Myr) and
the field returns to the EGB intensity, but the metals remain out of ionisation
equilibrium for timescales that can significantly exceed tau_AGN. We define
this phase as the AGN proximity zone ""fossil"" phase and show that high
ionisation stages (e.g. OVI, NeVIII, MgX) are in general enhanced, while the
abundances of low ions are reduced. In contrast, HI re-equilibrates rapidly
(<<tau_AGN) owing to its low neutral fraction at diffuse densities. We
demonstrate that metal column densities of intervening gas observed in
absorption in quasar sight lines are significantly affected by delayed
recombination for a wide range of densities, metallicities, and AGN strengths,
lifetimes, and duty cycles. We model the exceptionally strong z=0.9 NeVIII
absorbers observed by Tripp et al. (2011) as arising in a possible fossil zone
or near a recently turned-on AGN and we demonstrate that at low redshift even
moderate strength AGN could significantly enhance the high-ion metal columns in
the circumgalactic media of galaxies observed without active AGN. Fossil
proximity zones may be very important during the quasar era, z \sim 2-5. AGN
proximity zone fossils allow a whole new class of non-equilibrium solutions
that may be applicable to a large fraction of observed metal absorbers and
which could potentially change the inferred physical conditions and masses of

data from Subaru Suprime-Cam. We utilize the multi-band data and secure
redshifts to derive their rest-frame UV properties. These galaxies have steep
UV continuum slopes roughly between beta ~ -1.5 and -3.5, with an average value
of beta ~ -2.3, slightly steeper than the slopes of LBGs in previous studies.
The slope shows little dependence on UV continuum luminosity except for a few
of the brightest galaxies. We find a statistically significant excess of
galaxies with slopes around beta ~ -3, suggesting the existence of very young
stellar populations with extremely low metallicity and dust content. Our
galaxies have moderately strong rest-frame Lyman-alpha equivalent width (EW) in
a range of ~10 to ~200 \AA. The star-formation rates are also moderate, from a
few to a few tens solar masses per year. The LAEs and LBGs in this sample share
many common properties, implying that LAEs represent a subset of LBGs with
strong Lyman-alpha emission. Finally, the comparison of the UV luminosity
functions between LAEs and LBGs suggests that there exists a substantial
population of faint galaxies with weak Lyman-alpha emission (EW < 20 \AA) that
could be the dominant contribution to the total ionizing flux at z >= 6.

consists of 51 Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) at z ~ 5.7, 6.5, and 7.0, and 16
Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at 5.9 < z < 6.5. These galaxies exhibit a wide
range of rest-frame UV continuum morphology in the HST images, from compact
features to multiple component systems. The fraction of merging/interacting
galaxies reaches 40% ~ 50% at the brightest end of M_1500 <= -20.5 mag. The
intrinsic half-light radii r_{hl,in}, after correction for PSF broadening, are
roughly between r_{hl,in} ~ 0.05"" (0.3 kpc) and 0.3"" (1.7 kpc) at M_1500 <=
-19.5 mag. The median r_{hl,in} value is 0.16"" (~0.9 kpc). This is consistent
with the sizes of bright LAEs and LBGs at z >= 6 in previous studies. In
addition, more luminous galaxies tend to have larger sizes, exhibiting a weak
size-luminosity relation r_{hl,in} \propto L^{0.14} at M_1500 <= -19.5 mag. The
slope of 0.14 is significantly flatter than those in fainter LBG samples. We
discuss the morphology of z >= 6 galaxies with nonparametric methods, including
the CAS system and the Gini and M_20 parameters, and demonstrate their validity

LAEs at z ~ 5.7 and 6.5, by stacking a number of narrow-band images. We do not
find evidence of extended halos predicted by cosmological simulations. Such
Lyman-alpha halos, if they exist, could be weaker than predicted. Finally, we
investigate any positional misalignment between UV continuum and Lyman-alpha
emission in LAEs. While the two positions are generally consistent, several
merging galaxies show significant positional differences. This is likely caused
by a disturbed ISM distribution due to merging activity.

multi-object spectrographs (MOS), providing comprehensive follow-up to both
ground-based and space-borne imaging. With the advent of deeper imaging surveys
from, e.g., the HST and VISTA, there are a plethora of spectroscopic targets
which are already beyond the sensitivity limits of current facilities. This
wealth of targets will grow even more rapidly in the coming years, e.g., after
the completion of ALMA, the launch of the JWST and Euclid, and the advent of
the LSST. Thus, one of the key requirements underlying plans for the next
generation of ground-based telescopes, the Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs),
is for even greater sensitivity for optical and infrared spectroscopy. Here we
revisit the scientific motivation for a MOS capability on the European ELT,
combining updated elements of science cases advanced from the Phase A
instrument studies with new science cases which draw on the latest results and
discoveries. These science cases address key questions related to galaxy
evolution over cosmic time, from studies of resolved stellar populations in
nearby galaxies out to observations of the most distant galaxies, and are used
to identify the top-level requirements on an 'E-ELT/MOS'. We argue that several
of the most compelling ELT science cases demand MOS observations, in highly
competitive areas of modern astronomy. Recent technical studies have
demonstrated that important issues related to e.g. sky subtraction and
multi-object AO can be solved, making fast- track development of a MOS
instrument feasible. To ensure that ESO retains world leadership in exploring
the most distant objects in the Universe, galaxy evolution and stellar
populations, we are convinced that a MOS should have high priority in the
instrumentation plan for the E-ELT.

asymmetry (A), clumpiness (S), Gini coefficient (G) and second order momentum

on a combination of all these indexes, that improves the identification of
interacting systems. We also present a new software - PyCASSo (Python CAS

correcting for the completeness and reliability of the method, we find that the
fraction of interacting galaxies among the active population, 20(+7/-5) per

Choosing a mass-matched control sample leads to equivalent results, although

unipolar behavior as the boron concentration is increased, and by tuning the

adjusted. Correspondingly, the onset of a mobility gap in the device is
observed. Although the computed asymmetries are not sufficient to warrant

samples of brain tissue than tensile tests in order to estimate mechanical
properties of the brain tissue because they allow for homogeneous deformations.
The reliability of these tests depends significantly on the amount of friction
generated at the specimen/platen interface. Thus, there is a crucial need to
find an approximate value of the friction coefficient in order to predict a
possible overestimation of stresses during unconfined compression tests. In
this study, a combined experimental-computational approach was adopted to
estimate the dynamic friction coefficient mu of porcine brain matter against
metal platens in compressive tests. Cylindrical samples of porcine brain tissue
were tested up to 30% strain at variable strain rates, both under bonded and
lubricated conditions in the same controlled environment. It was established
that mu was equal to 0.09 +/- 0.03, 0.18 +/- 0.04, 0.18 +/- 0.04 and 0.20 +/-
0.02 at strain rates of 1, 30, 60 and 90/s, respectively. Additional tests were
also performed to analyze brain tissue under lubricated and bonded conditions,
with and without initial contact of the top platen with the brain tissue, with
different specimen aspect ratios and with different lubricants (Phosphate
Buffer Saline (PBS), Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and Silicon). The test
conditions (lubricant used, biological tissue, loading velocity) adopted in
this study were similar to the studies conducted by other research groups. This
study will help to understand the amount of friction generated during
unconfined compression of brain tissue for strain rates of up to 90/s.

physics and cosmology the effective number of neutrinos is Neff=3 (more
precisely, 3.046). In extensions of the standard model allowing for the
presence of DeltaNnu equivalent neutrinos (or dark radiation), Neff is
generally >3. The canonical results are reconsidered here, revealing that a
measurement of Neff>3 can be consistent with DeltaNnu=0 (dark radiation without
dark radiation). Conversely, a measurement consistent with Neff=3 is not
inconsistent with the presence of dark radiation (DeltaNnu>0). In particular,
if there is a light WIMP that annihilates to photons after the SM neutrinos
have decoupled, the photons are heated beyond their usual heating from e+-
annihilation, reducing the late time ratio of neutrino and photon temperatures
(and number densities), leading to Neff<3. This opens the window for one or
more equivalent neutrinos, including sterile neutrinos, to be consistent with
Neff=3. By reducing the neutrino number density at present, this allows for
more massive neutrinos, relaxing the current constraints on the sum of the
neutrino masses. In contrast, if the light WIMP only couples to the SM
neutrinos and not to the photons, its late time annihilation heats the
neutrinos but not the photons, resulting in Neff>3 even in the absence of
equivalent neutrinos or dark radiation. A measurement of Neff>3 is thus no
guarantee of the presence of equivalent neutrinos or dark radiation. In the
presence of light WIMPs and/or equivalent neutrinos there are degeneracies
among the light WIMP mass and its nature (fermion or boson, as well as its
couplings to neutrinos or photons), the number and nature (fermion or boson) of
the equivalent neutrinos, and their decoupling temperature (the strength of
their interactions with the SM particles). There's more to a measurement of
Neff than meets the eye.

neutron radius of 48Ca. We review radio and X-ray observations of neutron star
masses and radii. These constrain the equation of state (pressure versus
density) of neutron rich matter. We present a new energy functional that is
simultaneously fit to both nuclear and neutron star properties. In this
approach, neutron star masses and radii constrain the energy of neutron matter.
This avoids having to rely on model dependent microscopic calculations of
neutron matter. The functional is then used to predict the location of the drip
lines and the properties of very neutron rich heavy nuclei.

  normal-form single-wave model",,,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech math-ph math.MP nlin.PS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Pattern formation in biological, chemical and physical problems has received
considerable attention, with much attention paid to dissipative systems. For
example, the Ginzburg--Landau equation is a normal form that describes pattern
formation due to the appearance of a single mode of instability in a wide
variety of dissipative problems. In a similar vein, a certain ""single-wave
model"" arises in many physical contexts that share common pattern forming
behavior. These systems have Hamiltonian structure, and the single-wave model
is a kind of Hamiltonian mean-field theory describing the patterns that form in
phase space. The single-wave model was originally derived in the context of
nonlinear plasma theory, where it describes the behavior near threshold and
subsequent nonlinear evolution of unstable plasma waves. However, the
single-wave model also arises in fluid mechanics, specifically shear-flow and
vortex dynamics, galactic dynamics, the XY and Potts models of condensed matter
physics, and other Hamiltonian theories characterized by mean field
interaction. We demonstrate, by a suitable asymptotic analysis, how the
single-wave model emerges from a large class of nonlinear advection-transport
theories. An essential ingredient for the reduction is that the Hamiltonian
system has a continuous spectrum in the linear stability problem, arising not
from an infinite spatial domain but from singular resonances along curves in
phase space whereat wavespeeds match material speeds (wave-particle resonances
in the plasma problem, or critical levels in fluid problems). The dynamics of
the continuous spectrum is manifest as the phenomenon of Landau damping when
the system is ... Such dynamical phenomena have been rediscovered in different
contexts, which is unsurprising in view of the normal-form character of the
single-wave model.

aspects of coordination in complex, component-based robotic systems.
Coordination is a system level aspect concerned with commanding, configuring
and monitoring functional computations such that the system as a whole behaves
as desired. To that end a variety of models such as Petri-nets or Finite State
Machines may be utilized. These models specify actions to be executed, such as
invoking operations or configuring components to achieve a certain goal.
  This traditional approach has several disadvantages related to loss of
reusability of coordination models due to coupling with platform-specific
functionality, non-deterministic temporal behavior and limited robustness as a
result of executing platform operations within the context of the coordinator.
  To avoid these shortcomings, we propose to split this ""rich"" coordinator into
a Pure Coordinator and a Configurator. Although the coordinator remains in
charge of commanding and reacting, the execution of actions is deferred to the
Configurator. This pattern, called ""Coordinator-Configurator"", is implemented
as a novel Configurator domain specific language that can be used together with
any model of coordination. We illustrate the approach by refactoring an
existing application that realizes a safe haptic coupling of two youBot mobile
manipulators.

approximately nuclei with proton number $Z$ in the range $88 \leq Z \leq 94$

effects of streaming magnetized plasmas and the vacuum polarization effect can
shift the radiation spectra of stars. The modification of redshifts of spectra
can reach the same magnitude as the gravitational redshift in particular cases.
Moreover, the redshifts induced by the media are anisotropic and associated
with wave modes. For the O-mode, the modification of redshifts is dependent on
the frequency of the radiation. For lower-frequency radiation, the modification
is dominated by the plasma effect, while for higher-frequency radiations, by
the vacuum polarization effect. For the X-mode, the modification is
non-dispersive and dominated by the vacuum polarization effect. The vacuum

trivariate monomial ideals from minimal free resolutions. We use recent work of
L. Avramov, where he classifies the behavior of Bass numbers of embedding
codepth 3 commutative local rings. His classification relies on a corresponding
classification of their respective Koszul algebras, which is comprised of 5
categories. Using Avramov's classification of the Koszul algebra, along with
their respective Bass series we will learn how to identify the Koszul algebra
structure by inspecting the minimal free resolution of the quotient ring. We
give a complete classification of the Koszul algebra for generic monomial
ideals and offer several examples. In addition we will describe a class of
ideals with a specific Koszul algebra structure which was previously unknown.

  is already known, as pointed out to us by Josh Grochow",,,,"cs.CC cs.SC math.AG math.RA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mulmuley recently gave an explicit version of Noether's Normalization lemma
for ring of invariants of matrices under simultaneous conjugation, under the
conjecture that there are deterministic black-box algorithms for polynomial
identity testing (PIT). He argued that this gives evidence that constructing
such algorithms for PIT is beyond current techniques. In this work, we show
this is not the case. That is, we improve Mulmuley's reduction and
correspondingly weaken the conjecture regarding PIT needed to give explicit
Noether Normalization. We then observe that the weaker conjecture has recently
been nearly settled by the authors, who gave quasipolynomial size hitting sets
for the class of read-once oblivious algebraic branching programs (ROABPs).
This gives the desired explicit Noether Normalization unconditionally, up to
quasipolynomial factors.
  As a consequence of our proof we give a deterministic parallel
polynomial-time algorithm for deciding if two matrix tuples have intersecting
orbit closures, under simultaneous conjugation.
  We also study the strength of conjectures that Mulmuley requires to obtain
similar results as ours. We prove that his conjectures are stronger, in the
sense that the computational model he needs PIT algorithms for is equivalent to
the well-known algebraic branching program (ABP) model, which is provably
stronger than the ROABP model.
  Finally, we consider the depth-3 diagonal circuit model as defined by Saxena,
as PIT algorithms for this model also have implications in Mulmuley's work.
Previous work have given quasipolynomial size hitting sets for this model. In
this work, we give a much simpler construction of such hitting sets, using
techniques of Shpilka and Volkovich.

spatial averaging developed by Hardy, and independently by Murdoch and Bedeaux.
The constitutive equations for the stress are given as a sum of several
operator terms acting on the mesoscale average density and velocity. Each term
is a ""convolution sandwich"" containing the deconvolution operator, a
composition or a product operator, and the convolution (averaging) operator.
Deconvolution is constructed using filtered regularization methods from the
theory of ill-posed problems. The purpose of regularization is to ensure
numerical stability. The particular technique used for numerical experiments is
truncated singular value decomposition (SVD). The accuracy of the constitutive
equations depends on several parameters: the choice of the averaging window
function, the value of the mesoscale resolution parameter, scale separation,
the level of truncation of singular values, and the level of spectral filtering
of the averages. We conduct numerical experiments to determine the effect of
each parameter on the accuracy and efficiency of the method. Partial error

evolutionary factors pertaining to the reduced symmetry observed in these

shaping their structural organization. Interpreting the returnability index as
an equilibrium constant for a reaction network in equilibrium with a
hypothetical reference system, enables us to quantify the extent to which a
metabolic network is in disequilibrium. Further, by introducing a new directed
centrality measure via an extension of the subgraph centrality metric to
directed networks, we are able to characterise individual metabolites by their
participation within metabolic pathways. To demonstrate these ideas, we study
116 metabolic networks of bacteria. In particular, we find that the equilibrium
constant for the metabolic networks decreases significantly in-line with
variability in bacterial habitats, supporting the view that environmental

Using multi-band photometric data taken with the UH88 telescope, we determined
the integrated (two dimensional) radial light profiles of member galaxies in
each cluster using two independent approaches, i.e., the background subtraction
and the color-magnitude filtering. The ICM mass profile of each cluster in our
sample, also integrated in two dimensions, was derived from a
spatially-resolved spectral analysis using XMM-Newton and Chandra data. Then,
the radially-integrated light profile of each cluster was divided by its ICM
mass profile, to obtain a profile of ""galaxy light vs. ICM mass ratio"". The
ratio profiles over the central 0.65 R500 regions were found to steepen from
the higher- to lower- redshift subsamples, meaning that the galaxies become
more concentrated in the ICM sphere towards lower redshifts. The evolution is
also seen in galaxy number vs. ICM mass ratio profiles. A range of systematic
uncertainties in the galaxy light measurements, as well as many
radius-/redshift- dependent biases to the galaxy vs. ICM profiles have been
assessed, but none of them is significant against the observed evolution.
Besides, the galaxy light vs. total mass ratio profiles also exhibit gradual
concentration towards lower redshift. We interpret in the context that the
galaxies, the ICM, and the dark matter components followed a similar spatial
distribution in the early phase (z>0.5), while the galaxies have fallen towards
the center relative to the others at a later phase.

resonance of interaction leads to translation of the Floquet level-crossing

exoplanet detection and characterization (such as SPHERE on the European Very
Large Telescope, GPI on Gemini North, or future instruments on Extremely Large
Telescopes) is limited by uncorrected quasi-static aberrations. These
aberrations create long-lived speckles in the scientific image plane, which can
easily be mistaken for planets. Common adaptive optics systems require
dedicated components to perform wave-front analysis. The ultimate wave-front
measurement performance is thus limited by the unavoidable differential
aberrations between the wavefront sensor and the scientific camera. To reach
the level of detectivity required by high-contrast imaging, these differential
aberrations must be estimated and compensated for. In this paper, we
characterize and experimentally validate a wave-front sensing method that
relies on focal-plane data. Our method, called COFFEE (for COronagraphic
Focal-plane wave-Front Estimation for Exoplanet detection), is based on a
Bayesian approach, and it consists in an extension of phase diversity to
high-contrast imaging. It estimates the differential aberrations using only two
focal-plane coronagraphic images recorded from the scientific camera itself. In
this paper, we first present a thorough characterization of COFFEE's
performance by means of numerical simulations. This characterization is then
compared with an experimental validation of COFFEE using an in-house adaptive
optics bench and an apodized Roddier & Roddier phase mask coronagraph. An
excellent match between experimental results and the theoretical study is
found. Lastly, we present a preliminary validation of COFFEE's ability to
compensate for the aberrations upstream of a coronagraph.

suggests that some Mars Trojans may be remnants of the original planetesimal
population that formed in the terrestrial planets region. Here we revisit the
long-term dynamical evolution of the previously known Mars Trojans and show
that 2011 SC191, 2011 SL25 and 2011 UN63 are also trailing (L5) Mars Trojans.
They appear to be as stable as Eureka and may have been Trojans over the age of
the Solar system. The fact that five Trojans move in similar orbits and one of
them is a binary may point to the disruption of a larger body early in the
history of the Solar system. Such a catastrophic event may also explain the
apparently strong asymmetry in terms of number of objects (one versus seven)
between the L4 and L5 regions. Future spectroscopic observations should be able
to reject or confirm a putative common chemical signature that may lend further
support to collisional scenario.

manifold will be completely characterized by the long term density $\rho$ and
the long term current density $J$. As such, control problems may be
reformulated as variational problems over $\rho$ and $J$. We discuss several
optimization problems: the problem in which both $\rho$ and $J$ are varied
freely, the problem in which $\rho$ is fixed and the one in which $J$ is fixed.
These problems lead to different kinds of operator problems: linear PDEs in the
first two cases and a nonlinear PDE in the latter case. These results are
obtained through through variational principle using infinite dimensional
Lagrange multipliers. In the case where the initial dynamics are reversible we
obtain the result that the optimally controlled diffusion is also
symmetrizable. The particular case of constraining the dynamics to be
reversible of the optimally controlled process leads to a linear eigenvalue

derive and calculate the spectral density to the G$_0$W-RPA level which allows
us to identify the dispersive behaviour of the diamond geometry, and thus
electron-plasmon scattering, for variation in electron-electron coupling
strength and magnitude of applied strain. We find that the application of
strain changes the geometry (in momentum) of the electron-plasmon scattering
and that renormalizations beyond simple geometrical scalings further enhance
this effect. These results suggest that the properties of the plasmaron ring
can be tuned through the application of uniaxial strain, effectively producing
a larger fine structure constant without the need to change the sample

and evolution. However, the overshoot mixing is a long standing problem. The
uncertainty of the overshoot mixing is one of the most uncertain factors in
stellar physics. As it is well known, the convective and overshoot mixing is
determined by the radial chemical component flux. In this paper, a local model
of the radial chemical component flux is established based on the hydrodynamic
equations and some model assumptions. The model is tested in stellar models.
The main conclusions are as follows. (i) The local model shows that the
convective and overshoot mixing could be regarded as a diffusion process, and
the diffusion coefficient for different chemical element is the same. However,
if the non-local terms, i.e., the turbulent convective transport of radial
chemical component flux, are taken into account, the diffusion coefficient for
each chemical element should be in general different. (ii) The diffusion
coefficient of convective / overshoot mixing shows different behaviors in
convection zone and in overshoot region because the characteristic length scale
of the mixing is large in the convection zone and small in the overshoot
region. The overshoot mixing should be regarded as a weak mixing process. (iii)
The result of the diffusion coefficient of mixing is tested in stellar models.
It is found that a single choice of our central mixing parameter leads to
consistent results for a solar convective envelope model as well as for core
convection models of stars with mass from 2M to 10M.

adversarial setting is in contrast to traditional ones where the adversary
controls a subset of links. In particular, we study, in the main, the class of
routing-only schemes (as opposed to those allowing coding inside the network).
Routing-only schemes usually have low implementation complexity, yet a
characterization of the rates achievable by such schemes was open prior to this
work. We first propose an LP based solution for secure communication against
eavesdropping, and show that it is information-theoretically rate-optimal among
all routing-only schemes. The idea behind our design is to balance information
flow in the network so that no subset of nodes observe ""too much"" information.
Interestingly, we show that the rates achieved by our routing-only scheme are
always at least as good as, and sometimes better, than those achieved by
""na\""ive"" network coding schemes (i.e. the rate-optimal scheme designed for the
traditional scenario where the adversary controls links in a network rather
than nodes.) We also demonstrate non-trivial network coding schemes that
achieve rates at least as high as (and again sometimes better than) those
achieved by our routing schemes, but leave open the question of characterizing
the optimal rate-region of the problem under all possible coding schemes. We
then extend these routing-only schemes to the adversarial node-jamming
scenarios and show similar results. During the journey of our investigation, we
also develop a new technique that has the potential to derive non-trivial

mode number of n=3 to connected double null plasmas in the MAST tokamak
produces up to a factor of 9 increase in Edge Localized Mode (ELM) frequency
and reduction in plasma energy loss associated with type-I ELMs. A threshold
current for ELM mitigation is observed above which the ELM frequency increases
approximately linearly with current in the coils. The effect of the RMPs is
found to be scenario dependent. In one scenario the mitigation is only due to a
large density pump out event and if the density is recovered by gas puffing a
return to type I ELMs is observed. In another scenario sustained ELM mitigation
can be achieved irrespective of the amount of fuelling. Despite a large scan of
parameters complete ELM suppression has not been achieved. The results have
been compared to modelling performed using either the vacuum approximation or
including the plasma response. The requirement for a resonant condition, that
is an optimum alignment of the perturbation with the plasma, has been confirmed
by performing a scan in the pitch angle of the applied field.

method and to investigate the oscillation spectra when the validity does not
hold. We use a non-perturbative approach implemented in the ACOR code (Ouazzani
et al. 2012) that accounts for the effect of rotation on pulsations, and solves
the pulsation eigenproblem directly for dipolar oscillation modes. We find that
the limit of the perturbation to first order can be expressed in terms of the
rotational splitting compared to the frequency separation between consecutive
dipolar modes. Above this limit, non-perturbative computations are necessary
but only one term in the spectral expansion of modes is sufficient as long as
the core rotation rate remains significantly smaller than the pulsation
frequencies. Each family of modes with different azimuthal symmetry, m, has to
be considered separately. In particular, in case of rapid core rotation, the
density of the spectrum differs significantly from one m-family of modes to
another, so that the differences between the period spacings associated with
each m-family can constitute a promising guideline toward a proper seismic
diagnostic for rotation.

we constrain the parameter space of the two-Higgs doublet models where a softly
broken $Z_2$ symmetry is employed to avoid flavor-changing neutral currents at
tree level. There are four types of Yukawa interactions under the $Z_2$ charge
assignments of the standard model fermions. We find that the model with type-II
Yukawa interactions can better explain the experimental data among all. In this
scenario, the couplings of the light CP-even Higgs boson $h$ with weak gauge
bosons are almost standard model-like or only slightly different in a small
range of $\tan\beta$. In particular, we scrutinize a well-constrained region
previously ignored by other analyses and study the phenomenology of the extra

derived from three-dimensional (3D) ideal hydrodynamic simulation results
obtained using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code SPHC. The 3D results
were compared to equivalent one-dimensional (1D) simulation results. It is
found that peak thermal pressure scales linearly with the number of jets and
initial jet density and Mach number, quadratically with initial jet radius and

chamber wall radius. The stagnation time scales approximately as the initial
jet length divided by the initial jet velocity. Differences between the 3D and

Specially, we show that unconventional Fano resonances, recently discovered for
homogeneous spheres with large dielectric permittivities, can also occur for
metallic spheres coated with single dielectric layers. These resonances arise
from the interference between two electromagnetic modes with the same multipole
moment inside the shell and not from interactions between various plasmon modes
of different layers of the particle. In contrast to the case of homogeneous
spheres, unconventional Fano resonances in coated spheres exist even in the
Rayleigh limit. These resonances can induce an off-resonance field enhancement,
which is approximately one order of magnitude larger than the one achieved with
conventional Fano resonances. We find that unconventional and conventional Fano
resonances can occur at the same input frequency provided the dispersive core
has a negative refraction index. This leads to an optimal field enhancement
inside the particle, a result that could be useful for potential applications
in plasmonics.

is of great interest in ecological and epidemiological studies of association

clustering not accounted for by the available covariates, likelihood based
inference becomes computationally cumbersome due to the complicated nature of
the likelihood function and the associated score function. It is therefore of
interest to consider alternative more easily computable estimating functions.
We derive the optimal estimating function in a class of first-order estimating
functions. The optimal estimating function depends on the solution of a certain
Fredholm integral equation which in practice is solved numerically. The
approximate solution is equivalent to a quasi-likelihood for binary spatial
data and we therefore use the term quasi-likelihood for our optimal estimating

our quasi-likelihood method for spatial point processes is both statistically

studied for more than five decades. However, there are a number of important
issues which remain unresolved. The energy repartition amongst particle
populations in quasiperpendicular shocks is a multi-scale process related to
the spatial and temporal structure of the electromagnetic fields within the
shock layer. The most important processes take place in the close vicinity of
the major magnetic transition or ramp region. The distribution of
electromagnetic fields in this region determines the characteristics of ion
reflection and thus defines the conditions for ion heating and energy
dissipation for supercritical shocks and also the region where an important
part of electron heating takes place. All of these processes are crucially
dependent upon the characteristic spatial scales of the ramp and foot region
provided that the shock is stationary. The earliest studies of collisionless
shocks identified nonlinearity, dissipation, and dispersion as the processes
that arrest the steepening of the shock transition. Their relative role
determines the scales of electric and magnetic fields, and so control the
characteristics of processes such as of ion reflection, electron heating and
particle acceleration. The purpose of this review is to address a subset of
unresolved problems in collisionless shock physics from experimental point of
view making use multi-point observations onboard Cluster satellites. The
problems we address are determination of scales of fields and of a scale of
electron heating, identification of energy source of precursor wave train, an
estimate of the role of anomalous resistivity in energy dissipation process by
means of measuring short scale wave fields, and direct observation of
reformation process during one single shock front crossing.

approach for filling gaps in gridded environmental data. DGC is based on an
objective function that measures the distance between the directionally
segregated normalized squared gradient and curvature energies of the sample and
entire domain data. DGC employs data-conditioned simulations, which sample the
local minima configuration space of the objective function instead of the full
conditional probability density function. Anisotropy and non-stationarity can
be captured by the local constraints and the direction-dependent global
constraints. DGC is computationally efficient and requires minimal user input,
making it suitable for automated processing of large (e.g., remotely sensed)
spatial data sets. Various effects are investigated on synthetic data. The
gap-filling performance of DGC is assessed in comparison with established
classification and interpolation methods using synthetic and real satellite
data, including a skewed distribution of daily column ozone values. It is shown
that DGC is competitive in terms of cross validation performance.

database, we have found a population of very cold HI clouds. So far, the role
of these clouds in the interstellar medium (ISM) has remained unclear. Aims. In
this paper, we attempt to confirm the existence of the narrow-line HI emission
(NHIE) clouds by using the data from the Parkes Galactic all-sky survey (GASS)
and try to find their place among other coldest constituents of the ISM.
Methods. We repeat the search of NHIE with the GASS data and derive or compile
some preliminary estimates for the distribution, temperatures, distances,
linear sizes, column and number densities, masses, and the composition of NHIE
clouds, and compare these data with corresponding estimates for HI
self-absorption (HISA) features, the Planck cold clumps (CC), and infrared dark
clouds (IRDC). Results. We demonstrate that from LAB and GASS we can separate
comparable NHIE complexes, and the properties of the obtained NHIE clouds are
very similar to those of HISA features, but both of these types of clouds are
somewhat warmer and more extended and have lower densities than the cores in
the Planck CC and IRDC. Conclusions. We conclude that NHIE may be the same type
of clouds as HISA, but in different observing conditions, in the same way as
the Planck CC and IRDC are most likely similar ISM structures in different
observing conditions and probably in slightly different evolutionary stages.
Both NHIE and HISA may be an intermediate phase between the diffuse cold
neutral medium and star-forming molecular clumps represented by the Planck CC
and IRDC.

shapes the initial mass function (IMF). While observations of open clusters
propose a universal picture for the IMF from the substellar domain up to a few
solar masses, the young association eta Chamaeleontis presents an apparent lack
of low mass objects (m<0.1 Msun). Another unusual feature of this cluster is
the absence of wide binaries with a separation > 50 AU. We aim to test whether
dynamical evolution alone can reproduce the peculiar properties of the
association assuming a universal IMF. We use a pure N-body code to simulate the
dynamical evolution of the cluster for 10 Myr, and compare the results with
observations. A wide range of values for the initial parameters are tested in
order to identify the initial state that would most likely lead to
observations. In this context we also investigate the influence of the initial
binary population on the dynamics and the possibility of having a discontinuous
single IMF near the transition to the brown dwarf regime. We consider as an
extreme case an IMF with no low mass systems (m<0.1 Msun). The initial
configurations cover a wide range of initial density, from 10^2 to 10^8
stars/pc^3, in virialized, hot and cold dynamical state. We do not find any
initial state that would evolve from a universal single IMF to fit the
observations. Only when starting with a truncated IMF without any very low mass
systems and no wide binaries, can we reproduce the cluster core properties with
a success rate of 10% at best. Pure dynamical evolution alone cannot explain
the observed properties of eta Cha from universal initial conditions. The lack
of brown dwarfs and very low mass stars, and the peculiar binary properties
(low binary fraction and lack of wide binaries), are probably the result of the
star formation process in this association. (abridged)

continuous uncoded signals at sampling rates exceeding the Landau rate were
reported in recent works. This work examines sparse sampling of coded signals
at sub-Landau sampling rates. It is shown that with coded signals the Landau
condition may be relaxed and the sampling rate required for signal
reconstruction and for support detection can be lower than the effective
bandwidth. Equivalently, the number of measurements in the corresponding sparse
sensing problem can be smaller than the support size. Tight bounds on
information rates and on signal and support detection performance are derived
for the Gaussian sparsely sampled channel and for the frequency-sparse channel
using the context of state dependent channels. Support detection results are
verified by a simulation. When the system is high-dimensional the required SNR
is shown to be finite but high and rising with decreasing sampling rate, in
some practical applications it can be lowered by reducing the a-priory
uncertainty about the support e.g. by concentrating the frequency support into
a finite number of subbands.

cause mechanism of radiation from surface plasmon quanta. Both Casimir force
analysis and the measured data of radiations indicate us the system develops
quantized states by electric flux induced by ferromagnetic resonance. Quantum
analysis is used to understand the discrete radiations spectra for our
experimental measurement. The discrete radiations are reproduced by using time
dependent Schr\""odinger representation. As a result, we find the Josephson

However,
many real-world networks, such as the social network Twitter and the WWW

The epidemic threshold for the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic
has been proved to be 1/lambda_{1} in directed networks by N-intertwined
Mean-field Approximation, where lambda_{1}, also called as spectral radius, is
the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix. Here, we propose two algorithms
to generate directed networks with a given degree distribution, where the
directionality can be controlled. The effect of directionality on the spectral
radius lambda_{1}, principal eigenvector x_{1}, spectral gap
lambda_{1}-|lambda_{2}|) and algebraic connectivity |mu_{N-1}| is studied.
Important findings are that the spectral radius lambda_{1} decreases with the
directionality, and the spectral gap and the algebraic connectivity increase
with the directionality. The extent of the decrease of the spectral radius
depends on both the degree distribution and the degree-degree correlation
rho_{D}. Hence, the epidemic threshold of directed networks is larger than that
of undirected networks, and a random walk converges to its steady-state faster
in directed networks than in undirected networks with degree distribution.

literature for Multi-terminal Binary Decision Diagrams (MTBDDs) regarding the
well-definedness of the MTBDD abstraction operation. The statements try to
relate an operation * on a set of terminal values M to the property that the
abstraction over this operation does depend on the order of the abstracted
variables. This paper gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the
independence of the abstraction operation of the order of the abstracted
variables in the case of an underlying monoid and it treats the more general
setting of a magma.

whose action contains additional chirally invariant four fermion interactions.
Our lattice theory uses a reduced staggered fermion formalism to generate two
Dirac flavors in the continuum limit. In the current study we have tried to
reduce lattice spacing and taste breaking effects by using an improved fermion
action incorporating stout smeared links. As in our earlier study we observe
two regimes; for weak gauge coupling the chiral condensate behaves as an order
parameter differentiating a phase at small four fermi coupling where the
condensate vanishes from a phase at strong four fermi coupling in which chiral
symmetry is spontaneously broken. This picture changes qualitatively when the
gauge coupling is strong enough to cause confinement; in this case we observe a
first order phase transition for some critical value of the four fermi coupling
associated with a strong enhancement of the chiral condensate. We observe that
this critical four fermi coupling varies monotonically with bare gauge coupling
- decreasing, as expected, as the gauge coupling is increased. We have checked
that these results remain stable under differing levels of smearing. They
appear to rule out the appearance of new fixed points associated with chirally
invariant four fermion interactions in confining non abelian gauge theories.

relativistic generalization of a backreaction model based on volume-averaging
the Relativistic Zeldovich Approximation. In this model we investigate the
effect of kinematical backreaction on the evolution of cosmological parameters
as they are defined in an averaged inhomogeneous cosmology, and we show that
the backreaction model interpolates between orthogonal symmetry properties by
covering subcases of the plane-symmetric solution, the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi
solution and the Szekeres solution. We so obtain a powerful model that lays the
foundations for quantitatively addressing curvature inhomogeneities as they
would be interpreted as Dark Energy or Dark Matter in a quasi-Newtonian
cosmology. The present model, having a limited architecture due to an assumed
FLRW background, is nevertheless capable of replacing 1/4 of the needed amount
for Dark Energy on domains of 200 Mpc in diameter for typical (one-sigma)
fluctuations in a CDM initial power spectrum. However, the model is far from
explaining Dark Energy on larger scales (spatially), where a 6% effect on 400
Mpc domains is identified that can be traced back to an on average negative
intrinsic curvature today. One drawback of the quantitative results presented
is the fact that the epoch when backreaction is effective on large scales and
leads to volume acceleration lies in the future. We discuss this issue in
relation to the initial spectrum, the Dark Matter problem, the coincidence
problem, and the fact that large-scale Dark Energy is an effect on the past
light cone (not spatial), and we pinpoint key elements of future research.

equations written for complex matter fields are widely used to describe systems
as different as Bose-Einstein condensates of ultra cold atomic gases, thermal
convection, nematic liquid crystals, lasers and other nonlinear systems.
Exciton-polariton condensates recently realised in semiconductor microcavities
are pattern forming systems that lie somewhere between equilibrium
Bose-Einstein condensates and lasers. Because of the imperfect confinement of
the photon component, exciton-polaritons have a finite lifetime, and have to be
continuously re-populated. As photon confinement improves, the system more
closely approximates an equilibrium system. In this chapter we review a number
of universal equations which describe various regimes of the dynamics of
exciton-polariton condensates: the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which models
weakly interacting equilibrium condensates, the complex Ginsburg-Landau
equation---the universal equation that describes the behaviour of systems in
the vicinity of a symmetry--breaking instability, and the complex
Swift-Hohenberg equation that in comparison with the complex Ginsburg-Landau
equation contains additional nonlocal terms responsible for spacial mode
selection. All these equations can be derived asymptotically from a generic
laser model given by Maxwell-Bloch equations. Such an universal framework
allows the unified treatment of various systems and continuously cross from one
system to another. We discuss the relevance of these equations, and their
consequences for pattern formation.

current-vortex layer forms self-consistently in response to foot point driving
around the spine lines of the null. The layer first becomes unstable at an
intermediate distance from the null point, with the instability being
characterized by a rippling of the fan surface and a filamentation of the
current density and vorticity in the shear layer. Owing to the 3D geometry of
the shear layer, a branching of the current filaments and vortices is observed.
The instability results in a mixing of plasma between the two topologically

conformal supergravity where SU(1,1) acts off shell, using the fact that N=4
Poincare supergravity has a superconformal formulation. We explicitly construct
the corresponding local and nonlocal anomalous terms in the one-loop effective

without additional matter multiplets) using color/kinematics duality and the
double-copy construction we find that a particular U(1) symmetry which was
present in the tree-level amplitudes is broken at the quantum level. This
breaking manifests itself in the appearance of new one-loop N=4 supergravity
amplitudes that have non-vanishing soft-scalar limits (these amplitudes are
absent in N>4 supergravities). We discuss the relation between these

works by starting with a maximal interaction that includes all variables, and
then gradually removing variables if they fail to appear in randomly chosen

procedure is of order $p^\kappa$ for a value of $\kappa$ that can reach values
as low as 1 for very sparse data; in many more general settings, it will still
beat the exponent $s$ obtained when using a brute force search constrained to
order $s$ interactions. In addition, by using some new ideas based on min-wise

Disorder (BD) and other neuropsychiatric disease traits. Recent efforts have
been aimed at understanding the genetic basis of disease susceptibility, with
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) unveiling some promising associations.
Nevertheless, the genetic etiology of BD remains elusive with a substantial
proportion of the heritability - which has been estimated to be 80% based on
twin and family studies - unaccounted for by the specific genetic variants
identified by large-scale GWAS. Furthermore, functional understanding of
associated loci generally lags discovery. Studies we report here provide
considerable support to the claim that substantially more remains to be gained
from GWAS on the genetic mechanisms underlying BD susceptibility, and that a
large proportion of the variation in disease risk may be uncovered through
integrative functional genomic approaches. We combine recent analytic advances
in heritability estimation and polygenic modeling and leverage recent
technological advances in the generation of -omics data to evaluate the nature
and scale of the contribution of functional classes of genetic variation to a
relatively intractable disorder. We identified cis eQTLs in cerebellum and
parietal cortex that capture more than half of the total heritability
attributable to SNPs interrogated through GWAS and showed that eQTL-based
heritability estimation is highly tissue-dependent. Our findings show that a
much greater resolution may be attained than has been reported thus far on the
number of common loci that capture a substantial proportion of the heritability
to disease risk and that the functional nature of contributory loci may be
clarified en masse.

low-frequency radio telescopes will provide a powerful probe of astronomical
magnetic fields. However, achieving the full potential of these measurements
requires accurate removal of the time-variable ionospheric Faraday rotation
contribution. We present ionFR, a code that calculates the amount of
ionospheric Faraday rotation for a specific epoch, geographic location, and
line-of-sight. ionFR uses a number of publicly available, GPS-derived total
electron content maps and the most recent release of the International
Geomagnetic Reference Field. We describe applications of this code for the
calibration of radio polarimetric observations, and demonstrate the high
accuracy of its modeled ionospheric Faraday rotations using LOFAR pulsar
observations. These show that we can accurately determine some of the
highest-precision pulsar rotation measures ever achieved. Precision rotation
measures can be used to monitor rotation measure variations - either intrinsic
or due to the changing line-of-sight through the interstellar medium. This
calibration is particularly important for nearby sources, where the ionosphere
can contribute a significant fraction of the observed rotation measure. We also
discuss planned improvements to ionFR, as well as the importance of ionospheric
Faraday rotation calibration for the emerging generation of low-frequency radio
telescopes, such as the SKA and its pathfinders.

traps. The LOT generates folding trajectories under force in terms of
time-dependent changes in the distance between the beads. How to construct the
full intrinsic folding landscape (without the handles and the beads) from the
measured time series is a major unsolved problem. By using rigorous theoretical
methods---which account for fluctuations of the DNA handles, rotation of the
optical beads, variations in applied tension due to finite trap stiffness, as
well as environmental noise and the limited bandwidth of the apparatus---we
provide a tractable method to derive intrinsic free energy profiles. We
validate the method by showing that the exactly calculable intrinsic free
energy profile for a Generalized Rouse Model, which mimics the two-state
behavior in nucleic acid hairpins, can be accurately extracted from simulated
time series in a LOT setup regardless of the stiffness of the handles. We next
apply the approach to trajectories from coarse grained LOT molecular
simulations of a coiled-coil protein based on the GCN4 leucine zipper, and
obtain a free energy landscape that is in quantitative agreement with
simulations performed without the beads and handles. Finally, we extract the
intrinsic free energy landscape from experimental LOT measurements for the
leucine zipper, which is independent of the trap parameters.

phase transition between the nematic (N) and isotropic (I) phases in lyotropic
chromonic liquid crystals (LCLCs). The LCLCs are formed by self-assembled
molecular aggregates of various lengths and show a broad biphasic region. The
defects emerge as a result of two mechanisms. 1) Surface anisotropy mechanism
that endows each N nucleus (tactoid) with topological defects thanks to
preferential (tangential) orientation of the director at the closed I-N
interface, and 2) Kibble mechanism with defects forming when differently
oriented N tactoids merge with each other. Different scenarios of phase
transition involve positive (N-in-I) and negative (I-in-N) tactoids with
non-trivial topology of the director field and also multiply connected
tactoids-in-tactoids configurations. The closed I-N interface limiting a
tactoid shows a certain number of cusps; the lips of the interface on the
opposite sides of the cusp make an angle different from pi. The N side of each
cusp contains a point defect-boojum. The number of cusps shows how many times
the director becomes perpendicular to the I-N interface when one
circumnavigates the closed boundary of the tactoid. We derive conservation laws
that connect the number of cusps c to the topological strength m of defects in
the N part of the simply-connected and multiply-connected tactoids. We
demonstrate how the elastic anisotropy of the N phase results in non-circular
shape of the disclination cores. A generalized Wulff construction is used to
derive the shape of I and N tactoids as the function of I-N interfacial tension
anisotropy in the frozen director field of various topological charges m. The
complex shapes and structures of tactoids and topological defects demonstrate
an important role of surface anisotropy in morphogenesis of phase transitions

neutrino-driven convection in three-dimensional (3D) supernova-core
environments is still highly controversial. Studying a 27 Msun progenitor, we
demonstrate, for the first time, that violent SASI activity can develop in 3D
simulations with detailed neutrino transport despite the presence of
convection. This result was obtained with the Prometheus-Vertex code with the
same sophisticated neutrino treatment so far used only in 1D and 2D models.
While buoyant plumes initially determine the nonradial mass motions in the
postshock layer, bipolar shock sloshing with growing amplitude sets in during a
phase of shock retraction and turns into a violent spiral mode whose growth is
only quenched when the infall of the Si/SiO interface leads to strong shock
expansion in response to a dramatic decrease of the mass accretion rate. In the
phase of large-amplitude SASI sloshing and spiral motions, the postshock layer
exhibits nonradial deformation dominated by the lowest-order spherical
harmonics (l=1, m=0,-1,+1) in distinct contrast to the higher multipole
structures associated with neutrino-driven convection. We find that the SASI
amplitudes, shock asymmetry, and nonradial kinetic energy in 3D can exceed
those of the corresponding 2D case during extended periods of the evolution. We
also perform parametrized 3D simulations of a 25 Msun progenitor, using a
simplified, gray neutrino transport scheme, an axis-free Yin-Yang grid, and
different amplitudes of random seed perturbations. They confirm the importance
of the SASI for another progenitor, its independence of the choice of spherical
grid, and its preferred growth for fast accretion flows connected to small
shock radii and compact proto-neutron stars as previously found in 2D setups.

cold thermal dark matter of O(MeV). Our limit applies if the dark matter
remains in thermal equilibrium by coupling to electrons and photons or through
interactions with neutrinos, and applies regardless of whether the dark matter
annihilation cross-section is s-wave or p-wave. To illustrate our bounds we
apply them to a model of a supersymmetric neutralino annihilating to neutrinos,

lower bound on the neutralino dark matter mass of 3.5 MeV.

binaries with sub-parsec separations produce periodically recurring luminous
outbursts that interrupt periods of relative quiescence. This hypothesis is
motivated by two characteristics found generically in simulations of binaries
embedded in prograde accretion discs: (i) the formation of a central,
low-density cavity around the binary, and (ii) the leakage of gas into this
cavity, occurring once per orbit via discrete streams on nearly radial
trajectories. The first feature would reduce the emergent optical/UV flux of
the system relative to active galactic nuclei powered by single SMBHs, while
the second can trigger quasiperiodic fluctuations in luminosity. I argue that
the quasiperiodic accretion signature may be much more dramatic than previously
thought, because the infalling gas streams can strongly shock-heat via
self-collision and tidal compression, thereby enhancing viscous accretion. Any
optically thick gas that is circularized about either SMBH can accrete before
the next pair of streams is deposited, fueling transient, luminous flares that
recur every orbit. Due to the diminished flux in between accretion episodes,
such cavity-accretion flares could plausibly be mistaken for the tidal
disruptions of stars in quiescent nuclei. The flares could be distinguished
from tidal disruption events if their quasiperiodic recurrence is observed, or
if they are produced by very massive SMBHs that cannot disrupt solar-type
stars. They may be discovered serendipitously in surveys such as LSST or
eROSITA. I present a heuristic toy model as a proof of concept for the
production of cavity-accretion flares, and generate mock light curves and
specta. I also apply the model to the active galaxy OJ 287, whose production of
quasiperiodic pairs of optical flares has long fueled speculation that it hosts
a SMBH binary.

simulations of star formation by Dale et al. (2012, 2013) and evolve them for a
further 10Myr. We compare the dynamical evolution of star clusters that formed
under the influence of mass-loss driven by photoionization feedback, to the
evolution of clusters that formed without feedback. We remove any remaining gas
and follow the evolution of structure in the clusters (measured by the
Q-parameter), half-mass radius, central density, surface density and the
fraction of bound stars. There is little discernible difference in the
evolution of clusters that formed with feedback compared to those that formed
without. The only clear trend is that all clusters which form without feedback
in the hydrodynamical simulations lose any initial structure over 10Myr,
whereas some of the clusters which form with feedback retain structure for the
duration of the subsequent N-body simulation. This is due to lower initial
densities (and hence longer relaxation times) in the clusters from Dale et al.
(2012, 2013) which formed with feedback, which prevents dynamical mixing from
erasing substructure. However, several other conditions (such as supervirial
initial velocities) also preserve substructure, so at a given epoch one would
require knowledge of the initial density and virial state of the cluster in
order to determine whether star formation in a cluster has been strongly
influenced by feedback.

tool to study this elusive warm-hot phase. We have developed an analytic model
for the properties of NeVIII absorbers that allows for an inhomogeneous metal
distribution. Our model agrees with the predictions of a simulation from the
OWLS project indicating that the average line-of-sight metal-filling fraction
within the absorbing gas is low (c_L~0.1). Most of the NeVIII in our model is
produced in low-density, collisionally ionized gas (log n=-6 to -4 cm^-3, log
T=5-6). Strong NeVIII absorbers (log N(NeVIII)>14), like those recently
detected by HST/COS, are found to arise in higher density gas (log n>-4, log

The baryon content of the surrounding gas (which has similar densities and
temperatures as the NeVIII cloudlets) is a factor 1/c_L higher. We conclude
that NeVIII absorbers are robust probes of shock-heated diffuse gas, but that
spectra with signal-to-noise ratios S/N>100 would be required to detect the

changes along with the known transition of radio source populations below one
milliJansky. Optical identifications of the sources show that the variable
radio emission is associated with the central regions of an active galactic

of various source-finding algorithms, we use the best to carry out a transient
search. No transients were found. This implies that the areal density of
transients with peak flux density greater than 0.21 mJy is less than 0.37
deg^-2 (at a confidence level of 95%). This result is approximately an order of
magnitude below the transient rate measured at 5 GHz by Bower et al. (2007) but
it is consistent with more recent upper limits from Frail et al. (2012). Our

dark matter haloes (10^12--10^14 M_sol) from the Millennium II Lambda-CDM
N-body simulation. Here we present our method and basic results focusing on the
outer regions of galaxies, consisting of stars accreted in mergers. These
simulations cover scales from the stellar haloes of Milky Way-like galaxies to
the 'cD envelopes' of groups and clusters, and resolve low surface brightness
substructure such as tidal streams. We find that the surface density of
accreted stellar mass around the central galaxies of dark matter haloes is well
described by a Sersic profile, the radial scale and amplitude of which vary
systematically with halo mass (M_200). The total stellar mass surface density
profile breaks at the radius where accreted stars start to dominate over stars
formed in the galaxy itself. This break disappears with increasing M_200
because accreted stars contribute more of the total mass of galaxies, and is
less distinct when the same galaxies are averaged in bins of stellar mass,
because of scatter in the relation between M_star and M_200. To test our model
we have derived average stellar mass surface density profiles for massive
galaxies at z~0.08 by stacking SDSS images. Our model agrees well with these
stacked profiles and with other data from the literature, and makes predictions
that can be more rigorously tested by future surveys that extend the analysis
of the outer structure of galaxies to fainter isophotes. We conclude that it is
likely that the outer structure of the spheroidal components of galaxies is
largely determined by collisionless merging during their hierarchical assembly

using the far-ultraviolet and 24um emission, corrected for the old stellar
population in M31. We find a global value for the SFR of 0.25+/-0.05Msun/yr and
compare this with the SFR found using the total far-infrared (FIR) luminosity.
There is general agreement in regions where young stars dominate the dust
heating. Atomic hydrogen (HI) and molecular gas (traced by carbon monoxide, CO)
or the dust mass is used to trace the total gas in the ISM. We show that the
global surface densities of SFR and gas mass place M31 amongst a set of low-SFR
galaxies in the plot of Kennicutt (1998b). The relationship between SFR and gas
surface density is tested in six radial annuli across M31, assuming a power law
relationship with index, N. The star formation law using total gas traced by HI
and CO gives a global index of N=2.03+/-0.04, with a significant variation with
radius; the highest values are observed in the 10kpc ring. We suggest that this
slope is due to HI turning molecular at ~10Msun/pc2. When looking at H2
regions, we measure a higher mean SFR suggesting a better spatial correlation
between H2 and SF. We find N~0.6 with consistent results throughout the disk -
this is at the low end of values found in previous work and argues against a

bimodal. Assuming linear color-to-metallicity conversions, bimodality is viewed
as the presence of merely two GC subsystems with distinct metallicities, which
serves as a critical backbone of various galaxy formation theories. Recent
studies, however, revealed that the color-metallicity relations (CMRs) often
used to derive GC metallicities (e.g., CMRs of g-z, V-I and C-T1) are in fact
inflected. Such inflection can create bimodal color distributions if the
underlying GC metallicity spread is simply broad as expected from the
hierarchical merging paradigm of galaxy formation. In order to test the
nonlinear-CMR scenario for GC color bimodality, the u-band photometry is
proposed because the u-related CMRs (e.g., CMRs of u-g and u-z) are
theoretically predicted to be least inflected and most distinctive among
commonly used optical CMRs. Here, we present Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/WFC3
F336W (u-band) photometry of the GC system in M84, a giant elliptical in the
Virgo galaxy cluster. Combining the u data with the existing HST ACS/WFC g and
z data, we find that the u-z and u-g color distributions are different from the
g-z distribution in a very systematic manner and remarkably consistent with our
model predictions based on the nonlinear-CMR hypothesis. The results lend
further confidence to validity of the nonlinear-CMR scenario as an explanation
for GC color bimodality. There are some GC systems showing bimodal
spectroscopic metallicity, and in such systems the inflected CMRs often create
stronger bimodality in the color domain.

central 500 pc) of the Milky Way is lower by a factor of >10 than expected for
the substantial amount of dense gas it contains, which challenges current star
formation theories. In this paper, we quantify which physical mechanisms could
be responsible. On scales larger than the disc scale height, the low SFR is
found to be consistent with episodic star formation due to secular
instabilities or possibly variations of the gas inflow along the Galactic bar.
The CMZ is marginally Toomre-stable when including gas and stars, but highly
Toomre-stable when only accounting for the gas, indicating a low condensation
rate of self-gravitating clouds. On small scales, we find that the SFR in the
CMZ may be caused by an elevated critical density for star formation due to the
high turbulent pressure. The existence of a universal density threshold for
star formation is ruled out. The HI-H$_2$ phase transition of hydrogen, the
tidal field, a possible underproduction of massive stars due to a bottom-heavy
initial mass function, magnetic fields, and cosmic ray or radiation pressure
feedback also cannot individually explain the low SFR. We propose a
self-consistent cycle of star formation in the CMZ, in which the effects of
several different processes combine to inhibit star formation. The
rate-limiting factor is the slow evolution of the gas towards collapse - once
star formation is initiated it proceeds at a normal rate. The ubiquity of star
formation inhibitors suggests that a lowered central SFR should be a common
phenomenon in other galaxies. We discuss the implications for galactic-scale
star formation and supermassive black hole growth, and relate our results to
the star formation conditions in other extreme environments.

necessitates sky-target nodding across 27 WIRCam fields. Two sky-target nodding
strategies were tested, and we find that strictly minimizing sky sampling
latency does not maximize sky subtraction accuracy, which is at best 2% of the
sky level. The mean surface brightness difference between blocks in our mosaic
can be reduced from 1% to 0.1% of the sky brightness by introducing scalar sky
offsets to each image. The true surface brightness of M31 can be known to
within a statistical zeropoint of 0.15% of the sky level (0.2 mag arcsec sq.
uncertainty at R=15 kpc). Surface brightness stability across individual WIRCam
frames is limited by both WIRCam flat field evolution and residual sky
background shapes. To overcome flat field variability of order 1% over 30
minutes, we find that WIRCam data should be calibrated with real-time sky
flats. Due either to atmospheric or instrumental variations, the individual
WIRCam frames have typical residual shapes with amplitudes of 0.2% of the sky
after real-time flat fielding and median sky subtraction. We present our WIRCam
reduction pipeline and performance analysis here as a template for future

unprecedented precision witnessed a clear bimodality in absorption-line index
distributions of old GCs. Such division of extragalactic GCs, so far asserted
mainly by photometric color bimodality, has been viewed as the presence of
merely two distinct metallicity subgroups within individual galaxies and forms
a critical backbone of various galaxy formation theories. Given that
spectroscopy is a more detailed probe into stellar population than photometry,
the discovery of index bimodality may point to the very existence of dual GC
populations. However, here we show that the observed spectroscopic dichotomy of
M31 GCs emerges due to the nonlinear nature of metallicity-to-index conversion
and thus one does not necessarily have to invoke two separate GC subsystems. We
take this as a close analogy to the recent view that metallicity-color
nonlinearity is primarily responsible for observed GC color bimodality. We also
demonstrate that the metallicity-sensitive magnesium line displays
non-negligible metallicity-index nonlinearity and Balmer lines show rather
strong nonlinearity. This gives rise to bimodal index distributions, which are
routinely interpreted as bimodal metallicity distributions, not considering
metallicity-index nonlinearity. Our findings give a new insight into the
constitution of M31's GC system, which could change much of the current thought
on the formation of GC systems and their host galaxies.

the equation of state as well as the mass ratio, neutron star mass, and aligned

find that although the inspiral tidal signal is small, coherently combining
this signal with the merger-ringdown matter effect improves the measurability
of Lambda by a factor of ~3 over using just the merger-ringdown matter effect
alone. However, incorporating correlations between all the waveform parameters
then decreases the measurability of Lambda by a factor of ~3. The uncertainty

oscillations of coronal loops in the context of MHD coronal seismology to
establish the dependence of the sausage mode period and cut-off wavenumber on
the plasma-beta of the loop-filling plasma. A parametric study of the ratios
for different harmonics of the mode is also carried out.
  Methods: Full magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations were performed using
Lare2d, simulating hot, dense loops in a magnetic slab environment. The
symmetric Epstein profile and a simple step-function profile were both used to
model the density structure of the simulated loops. Analytical expressions for
the cut-off wavenumber and the harmonic ratio between the second longitudinal
harmonic and the fundamental were also examined.
  Results: It was established that the period of the global sausage mode is
only very weakly dependent on the value of the plasma-beta inside a coronal
loop, which justifies the application of this model to hot flaring loops. The
cut-off wavenumber kc for the global mode was found to be dependent on both
internal and external values of the plasma-beta, again only weakly. By far the
most important factor in this case was the value of the density contrast ratio
between the loop and the surroundings. Finally, the deviation of the harmonic
ratio P1/2P2 from the ideal non-dispersive case was shown to be considerable at
low k, again strongly dependent on plasma density. Quantifying the behaviour of
the cut-off wavenumber and the harmonic ratio has significant applications to
the field of coronal seismology.

Contemporaneous photometry in the optical and near-IR reveals a weaker

X-ray dips (very strong in the 15-50 keV band, weaker at lower energies) that
are separated by an interval equal to the X-ray period. This likely indicates
two physically separated emitting regions for the hard X-ray and lower energy

most likely a long-term precession, where the disc edge structure and X-ray
irradiation is responsible for the hard X-ray dips and modulation, although we
discuss other possible explanations, including Lense-Thirring precession in the

subject of debate. Recently, Nakariakov & Zimovets (2011) proposed a new model
suggesting that, in two-ribbon flares, such pulsations could be explained by
propagating slow waves. These waves may travel obliquely to the magnetic field,
reflect in the chromosphere and constructively interfere at a spatially
separate site in the corona, leading to quasi-periodic reconnection events
progressing along the flaring arcade. Such a slow wave regime would have
certain observational characteristics. We search for evidence of this
phenomenon during a selection of two-ribbon flares observed by RHESSI, SOHO and
TRACE; the flares of 2002 November 9, 2005 January 19 and 2005 August 22. We
were not able to observe a clear correlation between hard X-ray footpoint
separations and pulse timings during these events. Also, the motion of hard
X-ray footpoints is shown to be continuous within the observational error,
whereas a discontinuous motion might be anticipated in the slow wave model.
Finally, we find that for a preferential slow wave propagation angle of 25-28
degrees that is expected for the fastest waves, the velocities of the hard
X-ray footpoints lead to estimated pulse periods and ribbon lengths
significantly larger than the measured values. Hence, for the three events
studied, we conclude that the observational characteristics cannot be easily
explained via the Nakariakov & Zimovets (2011) propagating slow wave model when

stellar and accretion parameters using the Infrared Telescope Facility's SpeX.
We combine these new observations with our previous results on transitional
disks in Taurus, Chamaeleon I, Ophiuchus and Perseus, and with archival X-ray
observations. This produces a sample of 105 transitional disks of ""cluster"" age
3 Myr or less, by far the largest hitherto assembled. We use this sample to
search for trends between the radial structure in the disks and many other
system properties, in order to place constraints on the possible origins of
transitional disks. We see a clear progression of host star accretion rate and
the different disk morphologies. We confirm that transitional disks with
complete central clearings have median accretion rates an order of magnitude
smaller than radially continuous disks of the same population. Pre-transitional
disks --- those objects with gaps that separate inner and outer disks --- have
median accretion rates intermediate between the two. Our results from the
search for statistically significant trends, especially related to $\dot{M}$,
strongly support that in both cases the gaps are far more likely to be due to
the gravitational influence of Jovian planets or brown dwarfs orbiting within
the gaps, than to any of the photoevaporative, turbulent or grain-growth
processes that can lead to disk dissipation. We also find that the fraction of
Class II YSOs which are transitional disks is large, 0.1-0.2, especially in the

a compliant plastic interlayer. Due to their slenderness and heterogeneity,
they exhibit a complex mechanical response that is difficult to capture by
single-layer models even in the elastic range. The purpose of this paper is to
introduce an efficient and reliable finite element approach to the simulation
of the immediate response of laminated glass beams. It proceeds from a refined
plate theory due to Mau (1973), as we treat each layer independently and
enforce the compatibility by the Lagrange multipliers. At the layer level, we
adopt the finite-strain shear deformable formulation of Reissner (1972) and the
numerical framework by Ibrahimbegovi\'{c} and Frey (1993). The resulting system
is solved by the Newton method with consistent linearization. By comparing the
model predictions against available experimental data, analytical methods and
two-dimensional finite element simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed
formulation is reliable and provides accuracy comparable to the detailed
two-dimensional finite element analyzes. As such, it offers a convenient basis
to incorporate more refined constitutive description of the interlayer.

controlled by a noise term lead to a noise-driven, continuous order-disorder
phase transition. In this work, we extend the SVM by introducing a parameter
$\alpha$ that allows particles to be individualistic instead of gregarious,
i.e. to choose a direction of motion independently of their neighbors. By
focusing on the small-noise regime, we show that a relatively small probability
of individualistic motion (around 10%) is sufficient to drive the system from a
Vicsek-like ordered phase to a disordered phase. Despite the fact that the
$\alpha-$extended Model preserves the O(n) symmetry, the interaction range, as
well as the dimensionality of the underlying SVM, this novel phase transition
is found to be discontinuous (first-order), an intriguing manifestation of the
richness of the nonequilibrium flocking/swarming phenomenon.

algorithm are the crucial components of unstructured peer-to-peer (P2P)
networks as they directly affect the efficiency of search on such networks.
Scale-free (powerlaw) overlay network topologies are among structures that
offer high performance for these networks. A key problem for these topologies
is the existence of hubs, nodes with high connectivity. Yet, the peers in a
typical unstructured P2P network may not be willing or able to cope with such
high connectivity and its associated load. Therefore, some hard cutoffs are
often imposed on the number of edges that each peer can have, restricting
feasible overlays to limited or truncated scale-free networks. In this paper,
we analyze the growth of such limited scale-free networks and propose two
different algorithms for constructing perfect scale-free overlay network
topologies at each instance of such growth. Our algorithms allow the user to
define the desired scalefree exponent (gamma). They also induce low
communication overhead when network grows from one size to another. Using
extensive simulations, we demonstrate that these algorithms indeed generate
perfect scale free networks (at each step of network growth) that provide
better search efficiency in various search algorithms than the networks
generated by the existing solutions.

combination of NVSS data and K-band UKIDSS-LAS data, over 0.01<z<0.8. The FIR
properties of the sample are investigated as a function of L_1.4 GHz, z,
projected radio-source size and radio spectral index. In order to search for
stellar-mass dependent relations, we split the parent sample into those sources
which are below and above 1.5 L_{K}^{*}. Correcting for stellar mass and
redshift, we find no relation between the L250 and L_1.4GHz of radio AGN. This
implies that a galaxy's nominal radio luminosity has little or no bearing on
the SFR and/or dust mass content of the host system. The L250 of both the radio
detected and non radio-detected galaxies (defined as those sources not detected
at 1.4GHz but detected in the SDSS with r'<22) rises with increasing z. For
mass and colour matched samples, sub-1.5 L_{K}^{*} and super-1.5 L_{K}^{*}
radio-detected galaxies have 0.89\pm0.18 and 0.49\pm0.12 times the L250 of
their non radio-detected counterparts. We explain these results in terms of the
hotter, denser and richer halo environments massive radio-galaxies maintain and
are embedded in. These results indicate that all massive radio galaxies (>1.5
L_{K}^{*}) may have systematically lower FIR luminosities (~25%) than their
colour-matched non radio-detected counterparts. Compact radio sources (<30kpc)
are associated with higher L250s and dust temperatures than their more extended
(>30kpc) counterparts. The higher dust temperature suggests that this may be
attributed to enhanced SFRs, but whether this is directly or indirectly due to
radio activity (e.g. jet induced or merger-driven SF) is as yet unknown.

interferometer design has been widely adopted for current and future imaging
FTS instruments; we compare this design with two other common interferometer
formats. Examples of three instruments based on the Mach-Zehnder design are
presented. The techniques for retrieving astrophysical parameters from the

XMM-Newton and Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE), of the neutron star low-mass
X-ray binary 4U 1636-53. The observations cover several states of the source,
and therefore a large range of inferred mass accretion rate. These six
observations show a broad emission line in the spectrum at around 6.5 keV,
likely due to iron. We fitted this line with a set of phenomenological models
of a relativistically broadened line, plus a model that accounts for
relativistically smeared and ionised reflection from the accretion disc. The
latter model includes the incident emission from both the neutron-star surface
or boundary layer and the corona that is responsible for the high-energy
emission in these systems. From the fits with the reflection model we found
that in four out of the six observations the main contribution to the reflected
spectrum comes from the neutron-star surface or boundary layer, whereas in the
other two observations the main contribution to the reflected spectrum comes
from the corona. We found that the relative contribution of these two
components is not correlated to the state of the source. From the
phenomenological models we found that the iron line profile is better described
by a symmetric, albeit broad, profile. The width of the line cannot be
explained only by Compton broadening, and we therefore explored the case of
relativistic broadening. We further found that the direct emission from the
disc, boundary layer, and corona generally evolved in a manner consistent with
the standard accretion disc model, with the disc and boundary layer becoming
hotter and the disc moving inwards as the source changed from the hard in to
the soft state. The iron line, however, did not appear to follow the same
trend.

discussed in a subsequent article arXiv:1401.5149 that while finite-state

implemented by the BKL investigation and by the CB-LKSKS (Chernoff- Barrow-

according to different symmetry-quotienting mechanisms used to analyze the
dynamics according to the symmetries of the billiard domain and to the features
of the geodesics on the UPHP. In the inhomogenous case, new structures have
been uncovered, such that, in this framework, the billiard table (named 'small
billiard') consists of 1/6 of the previous one. The connections between the
symmetry-quotienting mechanisms are further investigated on the UPHP. The
relation between the complete billiard and the small billiard are also further
explained according to the role of Weyl reflections. The quantum properties of
the system are sketched as well, and the physical interpretation of the
wavefunction is further developped. In particular, a physical interpretation
for the symmetry-quotienting maps is proposed, according to the Fourier

measures of serial extremal dependence in a strictly stationary time series as
well as their estimation. 2. We discuss recent concepts of heavy-tailed time
series, including regular variation and max-stable processes. Serial extremal
dependence is typically characterized by clusters of exceedances of high
thresholds in the series. We start by discussing the notion of extremal index
of a univariate sequence, i.e. the reciprocal of the expected cluster size,
which has attracted major attention in the extremal value literature. Then we
continue by introducing the extremogram which is an asymptotic auto-correlation
function for sequences of extremal events in a time series. In this context, we
discuss regular variation of a time series. This notion has been useful for
describing serial extremal dependence and heavy tails in a strictly stationary
sequence. We briefly discuss the tail process coined by Basrak and Segers to
describe the dependence structure of regularly varying sequences in a
probabilistic way. Max-stable processes with Frechet marginals are an important
class of reg- ularly varying sequences. Recently, this class has attracted
attention for modeling and statistical purposes. We apply the extremogram to
max-stable processes. Finally, we discuss estimation of the extremogram both in

structure of an insulator results in metallic surface states with Dirac-like
dispersion. Here we report the discovery of Dirac-like surface states in the
perovskite superconductor [Tl$_4$]TlTe$_3$ (Tl5Te3) and its non-superconducting
tin-doped derivative, [Tl4](Tl$_{0.4}$Sn$_{0.6}$)Te$_3$, as observed by
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Density functional theory
(DFT) calculations predict a single spin-orbit driven band parity inversion at
the $Z$ point above the Fermi level of Tl5Te3, suggesting the surface states
are protected by Z$_2$ topology. Calculations on [Tl$_4$]SnTe$_3$ show no
parity inversions, implying that a topological transition from non-trivial to
trivial must occur upon doping with tin, i.e.,
[Tl$_4$](Tl$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$)Te$_3$. Thus [Tl$_4$]{\it M}Te$_3$ perovskites are
a possible new, non-trigonal class of Z$_2$ topological compounds.
Additionally, as Tl5Te3 is a stoichiometric bulk superconductor, these
perovskites are ideal materials in which to study the interplay between surface
states and bulk superconductivity.

transport is ballistic for weak interactions, while being diffusive in the
strongly-interacting regime, as evidenced by the heat-current scaling with the
system size. When bulk dephasing takes place in the system, diffusive transport
is induced in the weakly-interacting regime, with the heat current
monotonically decreasing with the dephasing rate. In contrast, in the
strongly-interacting regime, the heat current can be significantly enhanced by
dephasing for systems of small size.

major challenges in real-world video-based face recognition. A significant
design decision for any such system is whether to process and use all possible

probabilistic Multi-Region Histograms to characterise performance trade-offs
in: (i) selecting a subset of faces compared to using all faces, and (ii)
combining information from all faces via clustering. Three face selection
metrics are evaluated for choosing a subset: face detection confidence, random
subset, and sequential selection. Experiments on the recently introduced MOBIO
dataset indicate that the usage of all faces through clustering always
outperformed selecting only a subset of faces. The experiments also show that
the face selection metric based on face detection confidence generally provides
better recognition performance than random or sequential sampling. Moreover,
the optimal number of faces varies drastically across selection metric and
subsets of MOBIO. Given the trade-offs between computational effort,
recognition accuracy and robustness, it is recommended that face feature
clustering would be most advantageous in batch processing (particularly for
video-based watchlists), whereas face selection methods should be limited to
applications with significant computational restrictions.

periodicities in interaction time series are sufficient to correctly classify
95% of ties, even for casual users. These results clarify the nature of

tackle this problem. However, less emphasis has been placed on controlling the
noise inherent to the experimental approach. To address this problem, we
investigate here a procedure that controls for such experimental variance and
combine it with an assessment of probe performance. Two custom arrays were used
to evaluate the procedure: one based on 25mer probes from an Affymetrix design
and the other based on 60mer probes from an Agilent design. To assess
experimental variance, all probes were replicated ten times. To assess probe
performance, the probes were calibrated using a dilution series of target
molecules and the signal response was fitted to an absorption model. We found
that significant variance of the signal could be controlled by averaging across
probes and removing probes that are nonresponsive. Thus, a more reliable signal
could be obtained using our procedure than conventional approaches. We suggest
that once an array is properly calibrated, absolute quantification of signals
becomes straight forward, alleviating the need for normalization and reference
hybridizations.

electrophysiological behavior of the cell membrane, fluid compartments, Ca2+
release and uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and cytosolic Ca2+ buffering,
particularly by calmodulin. With this subsystem model, we can study the
mechanics of the production of intracellular Ca2+ transient in response to
membrane voltage clamp pulses. The chemomechanical model includes models of:
(a) the chemical kinetics of myosin phosphorylation, and the formation of
phosphorylated myosin cross-bridges with actin, as well as, attached latch-type
cross-bridges; and (b) a model of force generation and mechanical coupling to
the contractile filaments and their attachments to protein structures and the
skeletal framework of the cell. The two subsystem models are tested
independently and compared with data. Likewise, the complete (combined) cell
model responses to voltage pulse stimulation under isometric and isotonic

whether they require the imposition of ad hoc symmetries, (ii) the number of
new multiplets they introduce, and (iii) the number of arbitrary parameters
that appear. Adopting the view that the imposition of arbitrary new symmetries
is the least appealing approach, the simplest models have two new multiplets
and a minimal number of new parameters. With this in mind, we search for the
simplest models of radiative neutrino mass. We are lead to two new models,
containing a real scalar triplet and a charged scalar doublet (respectively),
in addition to the charged singlet scalar considered by Zee [h^+\sim(1,1,2)].
The new models are essentially simplified versions of the Zee model and appear
to be \emph{the simplest} models of radiative neutrino mass. However, these
models are only of pedagogical interest; despite successfully generating
nonzero masses, present-day data is sufficient to rule them out. The lessons
learned from these models also enable one to exclude a more general class of
radiative models. Moving beyond the minimal cases, we find a new model of
two-loop masses that employs the charged doublet \Phi\sim(1,2,3) and the
doubly-charged scalar k^{++}\sim(1,1,4).

and computational social science. The recent growth of Massively Multi-player
Online Games (MMOGs) has provided unprecedented access to large-scale data
which enables us to study such complex human behavior in a more systematic
manner. In this paper, we consider three different networks in the EverQuest2
game: chat, trade, and trust. The chat network has the highest level of
reciprocation (33%) because there are essentially no barriers to it. The trade
network has a lower rate of reciprocation (27%) because it has the obvious
barrier of requiring more goods or money for exchange; morever, there is no
clear benefit to returning a trade link except in terms of social connections.
The trust network has the lowest reciprocation (14%) because this equates to
sharing certain within-game assets such as weapons, and so there is a high
barrier for such connections because they require faith in the players that are
granted such high access. In general, we observe that reciprocation rate is
inversely related to the barrier level in these networks. We also note that
reciprocation has connections across the heterogeneous networks. Our
experiments indicate that players make use of the medium-barrier reciprocations
to strengthen a relationship. We hypothesize that lower-barrier interactions
are an important component to predicting higher-barrier ones. We verify our
hypothesis using predictive models for trust reciprocations using features from
trade interactions. Using the number of trades (both before and after the
initial trust link) boosts our ability to predict if the trust will be
reciprocated up to 11% with respect to the AUC.

propose a lepton-hadron hybrid model to explain simultaneously the GeV-TeV
$\gamma$-ray emission. Both electrons and hadronic cosmic rays were accelerated
during the past activity of the GC. Then these particles would diffuse outwards
and interact with the interstellar gas and background radiation field. The
collisions between hadronic cosmic rays with gas is responsible to the TeV
$\gamma$-ray emission detected by HESS. With fast cooling in the strong
radiation field, the electrons would cool down and radiate GeV photons through
inverse Compton scattering off the soft background photons. This scenario
provides a natural explanation of the observed GeV-TeV spectral shape of
$\gamma$-rays.

(LIRGs) inside the virial radii of two intermediate redshift clusters,
CL1416+4446 (z=0.397) and CL0926+1242 (z=0.489). We detect three galaxies at
high significance (5 to 10 sigma), and provide robust estimates of their CO
luminosities, L'CO. In order to put our results into a general context, we
revisit the relation between cold and hot gas and stellar mass in nearby field
and cluster galaxies. We find evidence that at fixed LIR (or fixed stellar
mass), the frequency of high L'CO galaxies is lower in clusters than in the
field, suggesting environmental depletion of the reservoir of cold gas. The
level of star formation activity in a galaxy is primarily linked to the amount
of cold gas, rather than to the galaxy mass or the lookback time. In clusters,
just as in the field, the conversion between gas and stars seems universal. The
relation between LIR and L'CO for distant cluster galaxies extends the relation
of nearby galaxies to higher IR luminosities. Nevertheless, the intermediate
redshift galaxies fall well within the dispersion of the trend defined by local
systems. Considering that L'CO is generally derived from the CO(1-0) line and
sensitive to the vast majority of the molecular gas in the cold interstellar
medium of galaxies, but less to the part which will actually be used to form
stars, we suggest that molecular gas can be stripped before the star formation
rate is affected. Combining the sample of Geach et al. (2009, 2011) and ours,
we find evidence for a decrease in CO towards the cluster centers. This is the
first hint of an environmental impact on cold gas at intermediate redshift.

production remains elusive. We measure distributions of the microscopic entropy
production in a single-electron box consisting of two islands with a tunnel
junction. The islands are coupled to separate heat baths at different

equality between work and free energy is not applicable in this case, the
entropy production becomes the relevant parameter. We verify experimentally

describe the forced motion of the pendulums, also other modes must be
considered, namely swinging and bouncing oscillations of the two suspended
masses, that resonate at higher frequencies (Hz). Although the system has
obviously 6+6 Degrees of Freedom, we find that 8 are sufficient for an accurate

the response to generic external disturbances and actuating forces or torques.

which in real-time imaging corresponds to post-processing of the beamformed
receive radio-frequency signals. Hence the transmit pulse complexes are the
same as for the previously published SURF reverberation-suppression imaging
method. The adjustment technique is tested on simulated data from propagation
of SURF pulse complexes consisting of a 3.5 MHz HF imaging pulse added to a 0.5
low-frequency sound-speed manipulation pulse. Imaging transmit beams are
constructed with and without adjustment. The post-processing involves
filtering, e.g., by a time-shift, in order to equalize the two SURF HF pulses
at a chosen depth. This depth is typically chosen to coincide with the depth
where the first scattering or reflection occurs for the reverberation noise one
intends to suppress. The beams realized with post-processing show energy
decrease at the chosen depth, especially for shallow depths where in a medical
imaging situation often a body-wall is located. This indicates that the
post-processing may further enhance the reverberation-suppression abilities of
SURF imaging. Moreover, it is shown that the methods might be utilized to
reduce the accumulated near-field energy of the SURF transmit-beam relative to
its imaging region energy. The adjustments presented may therefore potentially
be utilized to attain a slightly better general suppression of multiple
scattering and multiple reflection noise compared to for non-adjusted SURF
reverberation-suppression imaging.

been originally observed by Abramsky. In this paper we pursue a particle view

($\mu$), dispersion in $\mu$ and full error matrix, from which we fit the data
with several tri-axial parametric models. We use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) method to explore the parameter space and find that the best-fit model
is the $E_3$ model, with the distance to the GC is 8.13 kpc, the ratio of
semi-major and semi-minor bar axis scale lengths in the Galactic plane
$x_{0},y_{0}$, and vertical bar scale length $z_0$, is $x_0:y_0:z_0 \approx
1.00:0.43:0.40$ (close to being prolate). The scale length of the stellar
density profile along the bar's major axis is $\sim$ 0.67 kpc and has an angle
of $29.4^\circ$, slightly larger than the value obtained from a similar study
based on OGLE-II data. The number of estimated RC stars within the field of
view is $2.78 \times 10^6$, which is systematically lower than the observed
value. We subtract the smooth parametric model from the observed counts and
find that the residuals are consistent with the presence of an X-shaped
structure in the Galactic centre, the excess to the estimated mass content is
$\sim 5.8%$. We estimate the total mass of the bar is $\sim 1.8 \times 10^{10}

structures such as zonal jets and coherent vortices. One of the simplest models
of planetary turbulence is obtained by considering a barotropic flow on a
beta-plane channel with turbulence sustained by random stirring. Non-linear
integrations of this model show that as the energy input rate of the forcing is
increased, the homogeneity of the flow is broken with the emergence of
non-zonal, coherent, westward propagating structures and at larger energy input
rates by the emergence of zonal jets. We study the emergence of non-zonal
coherent structures using a non-equilibrium statistical theory, Stochastic
Structural Stability Theory (S3T, previously referred to as SSST). S3T directly
models a second order approximation to the statistical mean turbulent state and
allows identification of statistical turbulent equilibria and study of their
stability. Using S3T, the bifurcation properties of the homogeneous state in
barotropic beta-plane turbulence are determined. Analytic expressions for the
zonal and non-zonal large scale coherent flows that emerge as a result of
structural instability are obtained. Through numerical integrations of the S3T
dynamical system, it is found that the unstable structures equilibrate at
finite amplitude. Numerical simulations of the nonlinear equations confirm the
characteristics (scale, amplitude and phase speed) of the structures predicted

Low-temperature (LT) scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) can resolve both, the
local atomic structure and the superimposed charge density modulation. It is
shown that the established model for NbSe3 with two incommensurate (IC) modes,
q1 = (0,0.241,0) and q2 = (0.5,0.260,0.5), locked in at T1=144K and T2=59K and
separately confined to two of the three available types of bi-capped trigonal
prismatic (BCTP) columns, must be modified. The alternative explanation is
based on the existence of modulated layered nano-domains and is in good accord
with the available LT STM results. These confirm i.a. the presence of both IC
modes above the lower CDW transition temperature. Two BCTP columns, belonging
to a symmetry-related pair, are as a rule alternatively modulated by the two
modes. Such pairs of columns are ordered into unstable layered nano-domains,
whose q1 and q2 sub-layers are easily interchanged. The mutually
interchangeable sections of the two unstable IC modes keep a temperature
dependent long-range ordering. Both modes can formally be replaced by a single
highly inharmonic long-period commensurate CDW.

their host stars from literature and study the demographics of the brown dwarf

dwarf period-mass distribution diagram ($ 35<m\sin i<55 M_{\rm Jup}$ and

Observation biases are highly unlikely to cause this gap due to its short
period and medium mass, of which brown dwarfs can be easily detected by
previous RV surveys. Brown dwarfs above and below this gap have significantly
different eccentricity distribution, which not only confirms that this gap is
real, but also implies that they may have different origins. Our further
statistical study indicates that brown dwarfs below this gap may primarily form
in the protoplanetary disk through disk gravitational instability, while brown
dwarfs above this gap may dominantly form like a stellar binary through
molecular cloud fragmentation. Our discoveries have offered important insights

applications, including resource recommendation and link prediction. Here, we
construct and characterise social and place-focused graphs by using
longitudinal information about declared social relationships and about users'
visits to physical places collected from a popular online location-based social

constructed from the same data set, they have quite different structural
properties. We find that the social and location-focused graphs have different
global and meso-scale structure, and in particular that social and
place-focused communities have negligible overlap. Consequently, group
inference based on community detection performed on the social graph alone
fails to isolate place-focused groups, even though these do exist in the
network. By studying the evolution of tie structure within communities, we show
that the time period over which location data are aggregated has a substantial
impact on the stability of place-focused communities, and that information
about place-based groups may be more useful for user-centric applications than
that obtained from the analysis of social communities alone.

composed of linear multipole solvent molecules and embedding polarizable ions
modeled as Drude oscillators. Unlike previous dipolar Poisson-Boltzmann
formulations treating the solvent molecules as point dipoles, our model is able
to qualitatively reproduce the non-local dielectric response behavior of polar
liquids observed in Molecular Dynamics simulations and Atomic Force Microscope
experiments for water solvent at charged interfaces. The present theory
explains the formation of the associated interfacial hydration layers in terms
of a cooperative dipolar response mechanism driven by the reaction of the
solvent molecules to their own polarization field. We also incorporate into the
theory the relative multipole/dipole moments of water molecules obtained from
quantum mechanical calculations, and show that the multipolar contributions to
the dielectric permittivity are largely dominated by the dipolar one. We find
that this stems from the mutual cancellation of the first two interfacial
hydration layers of opposite net charge for multipolar liquids. Within the same
non-local dielectric response theory, we show that the induced ion
polarizability reverses the interfacial ion density trends predicted by the
Poisson-Boltzmann theory, resulting in a surface affinity of coions and
exclusion of counterions. The results indicate that the consideration of the
discrete charge composition of solvent molecules and ions is the key step
towards a microscopic understanding of non-local electrostatic effects in polar

has been known to be closely related to the stability of periodic traveling
waves. However, it is only recently that this relationship has been elucidated,
and that fully nonlinear results have been obtained. These only concern
dissipative systems though: reaction-diffusion systems were first considered by
Doelman, Sandstede, Scheel, and Schneider [Mem. Amer. Math. Soc. 2009], and
viscous systems of conservation laws have been addressed by Johnson, Noble,
Rodrigues, and Zumbrun [preprint 2012]. Here, only nondissipative models are
considered, and a most basic question is investigated, namely the expected link
between the hyperbolicity of modulated equations and the spectral stability of
periodic traveling waves to sideband perturbations. This is done first in an
abstract Hamiltonian framework, which encompasses a number of dispersive
models, in particular the well-known (generalized) Korteweg--de Vries equation,
and the less known Euler--Korteweg system, in both Eulerian coordinates and
Lagrangian coordinates. The latter is itself an abstract framework for several
models arising in water waves theory, superfluidity, and quantum hydrodynamics.
As regards its application to compressible capillary fluids, attention is paid
here to untangle the interplay between traveling waves/modulation equations in
Eulerian coordinates and those in Lagrangian coordinates. In the most general
setting, it is proved that the hyperbolicity of modulated equations is indeed
necessary for the spectral stability of periodic traveling waves. This extends
earlier results by Serre [Comm. Partial Differential Equations 2005], Oh and
Zumbrun [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 2003], and Johnson, Zumbrun and Bronski
[Phys. D 2010]. In addition, reduced necessary conditions are obtained in the
small amplitude limit. Then numerical investigations are carried out for the
modulated equations of the Euler--Korteweg system with two types of 'pressure'
laws, namely the quadratic law of shallow water equations, and the nonmonotone
van der Waals pressure law. Both the evolutionarity and the hyperbolicity of
the modulated equations are tested, and regions of modulational instability are
thus exhibited.

known that they emerge also as quasiparticles in several condensed matter
systems supporting topological order. We present a general method for deriving
the topological effective actions of (3+1) massless Dirac fermions living on
general backgrounds and coupled with vector and axial-vector gauge fields. The
first step of our strategy is standard (in the Hermitian case) and consists in
connecting the determinants of Dirac operators with the corresponding
analytical indices through the zeta-function regularization. Then, we introduce
a suitable splitting of the heat kernel that naturally selects the purely
topological part of the determinant (i.e. the topological effective action).
This topological effective action is expressed in terms of gauge fields using
the Atiyah-Singer index theorem which computes the analytical index in
topological terms. The main new result of this paper is to provide a consistent
extension of this method to the non Hermitian case where a well-defined
determinant does not exist. Quantum systems supporting relativistic fermions
can thus be topologically classified on the basis of their response to the
presence of (external or emergent) gauge fields through the corresponding
topological effective field theories.

the study of sparse structures. First, we consider limits of structures with
bounded diameter connected components and we prove that in this case the
convergence can be ""almost"" studied component-wise. We also propose the

Eventually, we consider the specific case of limits of colored rooted trees

kinematics of neutral pion production and decay are re-examined in light of two
physics questions: does isobaric production follow a scaling behavior? and what
is the minimum proton kinetic energy needed to make a gamma-ray of a certain
energy formed through intermediate pi0 production? The emissivity spectrum will
allow the interstellar cosmic-ray spectrum to be determined reliably, providing
a reference for origin and propagation studies as well as input to solar
modulation models. A method for such an analysis and illustrative results are
presented.

stress-time curves obtained from compressive constant strain-rate tests on two
metallic glass samples with different ductility levels in an effort to extract
hidden information in the seemingly irregular serrations. Two distinct types of
dynamics are detected in these two alloy samples. The stress-strain curve
corresponding to the less ductile $Zr_{65}Cu_{15}Ni_{10}Al_{10}$ alloy is shown
to exhibit finite correlation dimension and a positive Lyapunov exponent,
suggesting that the underlying dynamics is chaotic. In contrast, for the more
ductile $Cu_{47.5}Zr_{47.5}Al_{5}$ alloy, the distributions of stress drop
magnitudes and their time durations obey a power law scaling reminiscent of a
self-organized critical state. The exponents also satisfy the scaling relation
compatible with self-organized criticality. Possible physical mechanisms
contributing to the two distinct dynamic regimes are discussed by drawing on
the analogy with the serrated yielding of crystalline samples. The analysis,
together with some physical reasoning, suggests that plasticity in the less
ductile sample can be attributed to stick-slip of single shear band, while that
of the more ductile sample could be attributed to the simultaneous nucleation
of large number of shear bands and their mutual interactions.

  A fractional factorial design is used to systematically explore the large

determining the effects of optimisations and optimisation combinations.
Hardware power measurements on each platform are taken to ensure all

  We show that fractional factorial design can find more optimal combinations

run-time and energy consumption, and identify scenarios where they are and are
not correlated.
  A further conclusion of this study is the structure of the benchmark has a
larger effect than the hardware architecture on whether the optimisation will
be effective, and that no single optimisation is universally beneficial for
execution time or energy consumption.

off a probe photon propagating through a polarized short-pulsed electromagnetic
(e.g.\ laser) wave field, is analyzed. We show that the production probability
is determined by the interplay of two dynamical effects. The first one is
related to the shape and duration of the pulse and the second one is the
non-linear dynamics of the interaction of $e^\pm$ with the strong
electromagnetic field. The first effect manifests itself most clearly in the
weak-field regime, where the small field intensity is compensated by the rapid
variation of the electromagnetic field in a limited space-time region, which
intensifies the few-photon events and can enhance the production probability by
orders of magnitude compared to an infinitely long pulse. Therefore, short
pulses may be considered as a powerful amplifier. The non-linear dynamics in
the multi-photon Breit-Wheeler regime plays a decisive role at large field
intensities, where effects of the pulse shape and duration are less important.
In the transition regime, both effects must be taken into account
simultaneously. We provide suitable expressions for the $e^+e^-$ production
probability for kinematic regions which can be used in transport codes.

formation of planets. The growth of dust grains in these disks is the first

the spectral energy distribution (SED) of these objects.
  Aims: We develop a model for the dust phase of the edge-on oriented
circumstellar disk of the Butterfly Star which allows one to fit observed
multi-wavelength images and the SED simultaneously.
  Methods: Our model is based on spatially resolved high angular resolution
observations at 1.3 mm, 894 micron, 2.07 micron, 1.87 micron, 1.60 micron, and
1.13 micron and an extensively covered SED ranging from 12 micron to 2.7 mm,
including a detailed spectrum obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope in the
range from 12 micron to 38 micron. A parameter study based on a grid search
method involving the detailed analysis of every parameter was performed to
constrain the disk parameters and find the best-fit model for the independent
observations. The individual observations were modeled simultaneously, using
our continuum radiative transfer code.
  Results: We derived a model that is capable of reproducing all of the
observations of the disk at the same time. We find quantitative evidence for
grain growth up to ~100 micron-sized particles, vertical settling of larger
dust grains toward the disk midplane, and radial segregation of the latter
toward the central star. Within our best-fit model the large grains have a
distribution with a scale height of 3.7 AU at 100 AU and a radial extent of 175
AU compared to a hydrostatic scale height of 6.9 AU at 100 AU and an outer disk
radius of 300 AU. Our results are consistent with current theoretical models
for the evolution of circumstellar disks and the early stages of planet
formation.

X-ray emission, which translates into a systematic overestimate of 6 (12)% in
the measurement of M_gas at R_200 for our relaxed (perturbed) cluster sample.
At the same time, the increase of C_R with radius introduces also a ~2%
systematic underestimate in the measurement of the hydrostatic-equilibrium mass
(M_he), which adds to the previous one generating a systematic ~8.5%
overestimate in f_gas in our relaxed sample. Since the residual clumpiness of
the ICM is not directly observable, we study its correlation with the azimuthal
scatter in the X-ray surface brightness of the halo and in the y-parameter
profiles. We find that their correlation is highly significant (r_S = 0.6-0.7),
allowing to define the azimuthal scatter measured in the X-ray surface
brightness profile and in the y-parameter as robust proxies of C_R. After
providing a function that connects the two quantities, we obtain that
correcting the observed gas density profiles using the azimuthal scatter
eliminates the bias in the measurement of M_gas for relaxed objects, which
becomes (0+/-2)% up to 2R_200, and reduces it by a factor of 3 for perturbed
ones. This method allows also to eliminate the systematics on the measurements
of M_he and f_gas, although a significant halo to halo scatter remains.

functional theory (DFT), we have developed a simplified new DFT scheme that
only describes the electrostatic interaction of an external charged system with

assumption that the electron densities of the two fragments (charged system and
metal surface) are non-overlapping and neglecting non-local exchange
correlation effects such as the van der Waals interactions between the two
fragments. In addition, the response of the metal surface to the electrostatic
potential from the charged system is treated to linear order, whereas the
charged system is treated fully within DFT. In particular, we consider the
classical perfect conductor (PC) model for the metal response, although our
formalism is not limited to this approximation. The successful computational
implementation of this new methodology and the PC model is exemplified by the
case of a Na$^{+}$ cation outside a metal surface.

(GUVs) which contained small vesicles within their interior. Quenching these
vesicles from their fluid phase (T>Tm) through the phase transition in the gel
state (T<Tm) drives the inner vesicles to be expelled from the larger mother
vesicle via the accompanying decrease in vesicle area by ~25% which forces a
pore to open in the mother vesicle. We demonstrate that the proceeding time
evolution of the resulting efflux follows the relaxation of the membrane area
and describe the entire relaxation process using an Onsager-like nonequilibrium
thermodynamics ansatz. As a consequence of the volume efflux internal vesicles
are expelled from the mother vesicle. Although complete sealing of the pore may
occur during the expulsion, the global relaxation dynamics is conserved.
Finally, comparison of these results to morphological relaxation phenomena
found in earlier studies reveals a universal relaxation behaviour in GUVs. When
quenched from the fluid to gel phase the typical time scale of relaxation shows
little variation and ranges between 4-5 seconds.

attributed to the formation of coexisting domains or changes in the vesicle

localized mechanical perturbations, initiated by driving giant unilamellar

formation of rapidly growing, multiply localized, non-equilibrium buds, when
the transition takes place at short timescales (<{\tau}). We show that these
buds arise from small fluid-like perturbations and grow as spherical caps in
the third dimension, since in plane spreading is obstructed by the continuous
rigid gel-like matrix. Accounting for both three and two dimensional viscosity,
we demonstrate that dissipation decreases the size scale of the system and
therefore favours the formation of multiple buds as long as the perturbation
takes place above a certain critical rate. This rate depends on membrane and
media viscosity and is qualitatively and quantitatively correctly predicted by
our theoretical description.

altitude, and may progress to life-threatening pulmonary and cerebral oedema in
a minority of cases. International consensus defines AMS as a constellation of
subjective, non-specific symptoms. Specifically, headache, sleep disturbance,
fatigue and dizziness are given equal diagnostic weighting. Different
pathophysiological mechanisms are now thought to underlie headache and sleep
disturbance during acute exposure to high altitude. Hence, these symptoms may
not belong together as a single syndrome. Using a novel visual analogue scale
(VAS), we sought to undertake a systematic exploration of the symptomatology of
AMS using an unbiased, data-driven approach originally designed for analysis of
gene expression. Symptom scores were collected from 293 subjects during 1110
subject-days at altitudes between 3650m and 5200m on Apex expeditions to
Bolivia and Kilimanjaro. Three distinct patterns of symptoms were consistently
identified. Although fatigue is a ubiquitous finding, sleep disturbance and
headache are each commonly reported without the other. The commonest pattern of
symptoms was sleep disturbance and fatigue, with little or no headache. In
subjects reporting severe headache, 40% did not report sleep disturbance. Sleep
disturbance correlates poorly with other symptoms of AMS (Pearson r = 0.31 vs
headache). These results challenge the accepted paradigm that AMS is a single
disease process and describe at least two distinct syndromes following acute
ascent to high altitude. This approach to analysing symptom patterns has
potential utility in other clinical syndromes.

equation and of the Vlasov-Boltzmann equation, together with a fragmentation
kernel. We first show at the formal level that if the droplets are very small
after the breakup, then the solutions of this system converge towards the
solution of a simplified system in which the small droplets produced by the
breakup are treated as part of the fluid. Then, existence of global weak
solutions for this last system is shown to hold, thanks to the use of the
DiPerna-Lions theory for singular transport equations.

available. They maximize a given efficiency measure (such as D-optimality) and
provide an optimum design. Nevertheless, they do not guarantee a \emph{global}
optimal design. Indeed, they start from an initial random design and find a
local optimal design. If the initial design is changed the optimum found will,
in general, be different. A natural question arises. Should we stop at the
design found or should we run the algorithm again in search of a better design?
This paper uses very recent methods and software for discovery probability to
support the decision to continue or stop the sampling. A software tool written
in SAS has been developed.

We show that A-simplicity of B is a necessary condition for simplicity of A for
a large class of ring extensions when B is a direct summand of A. To obtain
sufficient conditions for simplicity of A, we introduce the concept of a degree
map for A/B. By this we mean a map d from A to the set of non-negative integers
satisfying the following two conditions (d1) if a \in A, then d(a)=0 if and

each non-zero ideal I of A and each non-zero a \in I there is a non-zero a' \in

the centralizer C of B in A is an A-simple ring, every intersection of C with
an ideal of A is A-invariant, ACA=A and there is a degree map for A/B, then A
is simple. We apply these results to various types of graded and filtered

scattering wavefunctions. The complex coupling coefficients $\omega$ between
system and environment arise from the principal value integral and the
residuum. At high level density where the resonance states overlap, the
dynamics of the system is determined by exceptional points. At these points,
the eigenvalues of two states are equal and the corresponding eigenfunctions
are linearly dependent. It is shown in the present paper that Im$(\omega)$ and
Re$(\omega)$ influence the system properties differently in the surrounding of
exceptional points. Controlling the system by a parameter, the eigenvalues
avoid crossing in energy near an exceptional point under the influence of
Re$(\omega)$ in a similar manner as it is well known from discrete states.
Im$(\omega)$ however leads to width bifurcation and finally (when the system is
coupled to one channel, i.e. to a common continuum of scattering
wavefunctions), to a splitting of the system into two parts with different
characteristic time scales. Physically, the system is stabilized by this
splitting since the lifetimes of most ($N-1$) states are longer than before
while that of only one state is shorter. In the cross section the short-lived
state appears as a background term in high-resolution experiments. The
wavefunctions of the long-lived states are mixed in those of the original ones
in a comparably large parameter range. Numerical results for the eigenvalues
and eigenfunctions are shown for $N=2, ~4$ and 10 states coupled mostly to 1
channel.

curve, providing unprecedented detail with high cadence data during t=1.5-49
days post-discovery, was divided into four phases based on the idealised nova
optical light curve; the initial rise, the pre-maximum halt (or the 'plateau'),
the final rise, and the early decline. Variation in the SMEI light curve
reveals a strongly detected period of 1.44\pm0.04 days before the visual
maximum. The spectra from the LT and SMARTS telescopes were investigated during
t=0.8-80.7 and 155.1-249.9 days. The nova was observed very early in its rise
and a distinct high velocity ejection phase was evident. A marked drop and then
gradual increase in derived ejection velocities were present. Here we propose
two different stages of mass loss, a short-lived phase occurring immediately
after outburst followed by a more steadily evolving and higher mass loss phase.
The overall spectral development follows that typical of a Classical Nova and
comparison to the photometric behaviour reveals consistencies with the simple
evolving pseudo-photosphere model of the nova outburst. The optical spectra are
also compared to X-ray and radio light curves. Weak [Fe X] 6375A emission was
marginally detected before the rise in X-ray emission. The middle of the
plateau in the X-ray light curve is coincident with the appearance of high
ionization species detected in optical spectra and the peak of the high
frequency radio flux.

which differs photometrically and spectroscopically from its last outburst in
the 1970s. Valuable information on the physics of LBV eruptions can be gained
by analyzing the spectral evolution during this eruption and by comparing R71's
present appearance to its previous outburst and its quiescent state. Here we
present the first spectra of an ongoing monitoring program with VLT/X-shooter
and compare them to archival VLT/UVES and MPG/ESO-2.2m/FEROS spectra from
2002-2011. The discussed data include pre-eruption spectra in 2002 and 2005, a
spectrum of the transitionary phase between quiescent and eruptive state in
2007, and spectra of the eruption in 2011-2012. The 2011-2012 spectra are
dominated by strong neutral and singly ionized metal absorption lines likely
formed in a large ""pseudo-photosphere."" We find an unusually low apparent
temperature of R71 of only ~6650 K; the star resembles a late F supergiant.
R71's visual lightcurve had a maximum in 2012 with mV ~ 8.7 mag. Given the
uncertainty in the extinction towards R71, this corresponds to a bolometric
luminosity of -9.8 mag to -10.3 mag. R71's 2011-2012 spectra do not show H I
and Fe II P Cyg profiles, which were present during its last outburst in the
1970s and which are normally observed during LBV outbursts. The rise in R71's
visual magnitude and the low apparent temperature of its pseudo-photosphere
during the current eruption are unprecedented for this star. R71 most likely
increased its bolometric luminosity by 0.4-1.3 mag compared to its quiescent
state. The very low temperature of its pseudo-photosphere implies a very
high-mass loss rate, a factor of 1000 higher than during the quiescence state.
No fast-moving material indicative of an explosion is observed (abridged).

active region as a reference and compare the Ohmic-type heating in this model
to parametrizations for alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC)
heating models, in particular, we use Alfven wave and MHD turbulence heating.
We extract the quantities needed for these two parametrizations from the
reference model and investigate the spatial distribution of the heat input in
all three cases, globally and along individual field lines. To study
differences in the resulting coronal emission we employ 1D loop models with a
prescribed heat input based on the heating rate we extracted along a bundle of
field lines. On average, all heating implementations show a roughly drop of the
heating rate with height. This also holds for individual field lines. While all
mechanism show a concentration of the energy input towards the low parts of the
atmosphere, for individual field lines the concentration towards the footpoints
is much stronger for the DC mechanisms than for the Alfven wave AC case. In
contrast, the AC model gives a stronger concentration of the emission towards
the footpoints. This is because the more homogeneous distribution of the energy
input leads to higher coronal temperatures and a more extended transition
region. The significant difference in the concentration of the heat input
towards the foot points for the AC and DC mechanisms, and the pointed
difference in the spatial distribution of the coronal emission for these cases
shows that the two mechanisms should be discriminable by observations. Before
drawing final conclusions, these parametrizations should be implemented in new

epistasis). For the following cases, we characterize explicitly the possible
equilibrium configurations: weak, strong, highly asymmetric, and
super-symmetric migration, no or weak recombination, and independent or
strongly recombining loci. For independent loci (linkage equilibrium) and for
completely linked loci, we derive the possible bifurcation patterns as
functions of the total migration rate, assuming all other parameters are fixed
but arbitrary. For these and other cases, we determine analytically the maximum
migration rate below which a stable fully polymorphic equilibrium exists. In
this case, differentiation and local adaptation are maintained. Their degree is
quantified by a new multilocus version of $\Fst$ and by the migration load,
respectively. In addition, we investigate the invasion conditions of locally
beneficial mutants and show that linkage to a locus that is already in
migration-selection balance facilitates invasion. Hence, loci of much smaller
effect can invade than predicted by one-locus theory if linkage is sufficiently
tight. We study how this minimum amount of linkage admitting invasion depends
on the migration pattern. This suggests the emergence of clusters of locally
beneficial mutations, which may form `genomic islands of divergence'. Finally,
the influence of linkage and two-way migration on the effective migration rate
at a linked neutral locus is explored. Numerical work complements our
analytical results.

clouds of overdensities that emits/absorb radiation or interact gravitationally
with the photons, and with a finite range of sizes and distances for those
clouds. The standard cosmological interpretation of ""acoustic"" peaks is just a
particular case; peaks in the power spectrum might be generated in scenarios
within some alternative cosmological model that have nothing to do with
oscillations due to gravitational compression in a fluid.
  We also calculate the angular correlation function of the anisotropies from
the WMAP-7yr and ACT data, in an attempt to derive the minimum number of
parameters a polynomial function should have to fit it: a set of polynomial
functions with a total of six free parameters, apart from the amplitude, is
enough to reproduce the first two peaks. However, the standard model with six
tunable free parameters also reproduces higher order peaks, giving the standard
model a higher confidence. At present, while no simple function with six free
parameters is found to give a fit as good as the one given by the standard
cosmological model, we may consider the predictive power of the standard model
beyond an instrumentalist approach (such as the Ptolemaic astronomy model of
the orbits of the planets).

develop a flexible and computationally efficient approach using principal

coming from the very hot post-shock material are non-negligible in the shock's

the shock. Many simulations of radiative shocks, both in the contexts of
astrophysics and laboratory experiments, use a grey treatment of radiative
transfer coupled to the hydrodynamics. However, the opacities of the gas show
large variations as a function of frequency and this needs to be taken into
account if one wishes to reproduce the relevant physics. We have performed
radiation hydrodynamics simulations of radiative shocks in Ar using multigroup
(frequency dependent) radiative transfer with the HERACLES code. The opacities
were taken from the ODALISC database. We show the influence of the number of
frequency groups used on the dynamics and morphologies of subcritical and
supercritical radiative shocks in Ar gas, and in particular on the extent of
the radiative precursor. We find that simulations with even a low number of
groups show significant differences compared to single-group (grey)
simulations, and that in order to correctly model such shocks, a minimum number
of groups is required. Results appear to eventually converge as the number of
groups increases above 50. We were also able to resolve in our simulations of
supercritical shocks the adaptation zones which connect the cooling layer to
the final post-shock state and the precursor. Inside these adaptation zones, we
find that the radiative flux just ahead of the shock in one or several
high-opacity groups can heat the gas to a temperature higher than the
post-shock temperature. Through the use of Hugoniot curves, we have checked the
consistency of our radiation hydrodynamics scheme by showing that conservation

wave optics method (in comparison with ray tracing) to evaluate the performance
of the self-seeding scheme. Our wave optics analysis takes into account the
actual beam wavefront of the radiation from the coherent FEL source, third
order aberrations, and errors from each optical element. Wave optics is the
only method available, in combination with FEL simulations, for the design of a

the self-seeding scheme is distinguished by the much needed experimental

actively shaping the spatial profile of the optical pump. This unique degree of

In most individual objects we are able to fit the profiles of all the emission
lines with a kinematic model derived from the strong [OIII]4959,5007 lines,
using between 2 and 5 Gaussian components. From these fits we derive diagnostic
line ratios that are used to investigate the ionization mechanisms for the
different kinematic components. We show that, in general, the line ratios are
consistent with gas of super-solar abundance photoionized by a combination of
AGN and starburst activity, with an increasing contribution from the AGN with
increasing FWHM of the individual kinematic components, and the AGN
contribution dominating for the broadest components. However, shock ionization
cannot be ruled out in some cases. Our derived upper limits on the mass
outflows rates and kinetic powers of the emission line outflows show that they
can be as energetically significant as the neutral and molecular outflows in
ULIRGs-consistent with the requirements of the hydrodynamic simulations that
include AGN feedback. However, the uncertainties are large, and more accurate
estimates of the radii, densities and reddening of the outflows are required to
put these results on a firmer footing.

conditions are necessary to construct global models of stars, galaxies, etc.,
where a vacuum region surrounds a finite body in equilibrium, as well as to
describe shells of matter and braneworlds, and they are stricter than in
General Relativity in both cases. For the latter case, I obtain the field
equations for the energy-momentum tensor on the shell/brane, and they turn out
to be, remarkably, the same as in General Relativity. An exceptional case for
quadratic F(R), previously overlooked in the literature, is shown to arise
allowing for a discontinuous R, and leading to an energy-momentum content on
the shell with unexpected properties, such as non-vanishing components normal
to the shell and a new term resembling classical dipole distributions. For the
former case, they do not only require the agreement of the first and second
fundamental forms on both sides of the matching hypersurface, but also that the
scalar curvature R and its first derivative agree there too. I argue that, as a
consequence, matched solutions in General Relativity are not solutions of
F(R)-models generically. Several relevant examples are analyzed.

particular prediction, later became known as the a.c.-Josephson effect, said
that under a finite d.c. bias the tunnelling current contains an a.c.
supercurrent component, oscillating at microwave frequency. This prediction was
experimentally verified through observation of the junction current-voltage
characteristics modified by the interaction with the electromagnetic radiation,
and direct detection of the microwave radiation emitted from the junction
itself. It had also been established that the behaviour of the d.c.
current-voltage characteristic is determined by the high-frequency dynamics of
the Josephson junction, and can be used to study various systems such as atoms
in the electron-spin resonance, optical phonons in high-Tc superconductors, and
vibrating Nb molecules. Here we present an InAs nanowire Josephson junction

not possible or practical to place sensors on all sides of the target room or

may be able to place sensors in adjacent rooms, but not in front of the room,
where the subject would see them. In this paper, we show that using two
ultra-wideband (UWB) impulse radios, in addition to multiple RSS sensors,
improves the localization accuracy, particularly on the axis where no sensors
are placed (which we call the x-axis). We introduce three methods for combining
the RSS and UWB data. By using UWB radios together with RSS sensors, it is
still possible to localize a person through walls even when the devices are

regime is studied by means of Emulsion Stability Simulations (ESS). The effects
of Ostwald ripening, flocculation, coalescence, gravity, and hydration forc- es
are considered. According to these calculations flocculation and coalescence
are predominant during the first few seconds after the preparation of the
emulsion. This favors the generation of a right-skewed Drop Size Distribu- tion
(DSD). As the system evolves, the drops grow larger and more repulsive causing
a slow down of the flocculation process. In the case of dodecane (C12) and
hexadecane (C16) the referred phenomena, reinforce the ripening trend to
subvert the initial DSD variation, producing a meta-stable distribution which
is preserved during several minutes. After this time, Ostwald ripening
dominates: the skirt of the distribution changes progressively from
right-skewed to left-skewed. Consistent with these changes, the cube average
radius of the emulsion increases rapidly at first, but progressively diminishes
generating a concave-downward curve that stabilizes asymptotically. In the case
of dodecane and hexadecane the complete dissolution of the drops promoted by
ripening is prevented at all times due to coalescence. In the case of octane
(C8) a substantial amount of drops is lost by dissolution, forbidding the
attain- ment of a stable DSD. In all cases the molecular exchange only favors a
decrease of the average radius as a function of time. It is the elimination of
drops either by dissolution or coalescence which causes an increase of the
average radius of the emulsion.

state. These it excited states may be the consequence of interactions during
inflation, or may be a remnant of the era that preceded inflation. In this
paper we analyze the bispectrum, and show that in the regime of theoretical
control the resulting signal in the squeezed limit remains undetectably small
in all known models which continuously excite the state. We also show that the
signal remains undetectably small if the initial state is related to the
Bunch-Davies state by a Bogoliubov transformation and the energy density in the
state is small enough so that the usual slow-roll conditions are obeyed.
Bogoliubov states that lead to violations of the slow-roll conditions, as well
as more general excited states, require more careful treatment and will be
discussed in a separate publication.

dynamics (which is the standard model of frequency dependent selection) with
the model of an age-structured population. The new framework allows for the
modelling of populations consisting of competing strategies carried by
individuals who change across their life cycle. Firstly the discretization of
the McKendrick von Foerster model is derived. It is shown that the Euler--Lotka
equation is satisfied when the new model reaches a steady state (i.e. stable
frequencies between the age classes). This discretization consists of the unit
age classes and the timescale is chosen that only a fraction of individuals
play single game round. This implies linear dynamics within single time unit
when individuals not killed during game round are moved from one age class to
another. Since its local linear behaviour the system is equivalent to large
Bernadelli-Lewis-Leslie matrix. Then the methodology of multipopulation games
is used for the derivation of two, mutually equivalent systems of equations.
The first contains equations describing the evolution of the strategy
frequencies in the whole population completed by subsystems of equations
describing the evolution of the age structure for each strategy. The second
system contains equations describing the changes of the general population's
age structure, completed with subsystems of equations describing the selection
of the strategies within each age class. Then the obtained system of replicator
dynamics is presented in the form of the mixed ODE-PDE system. The obtained
results are illustrated by example of the sex ratio model which shows that when
different mortalities of both sexes are assumed, the sex ratio of 0.5 is
obtained but that Fisher's mechanism driven by the reproductive value of the
different sexes is not in equilibrium.

signal is a hindrance. In their pristine state, most CCD pixels are `cool';
they exhibit low, quasi uniform dark current, which can be estimated and
corrected for. In space, after having been hit by an energetic particle, pixels
can turn `hot'. They start delivering excessive, less predictable, dark
current. The hot pixels need therefore to be flagged so that subsequent
analysis may ignore them. The image data of the PICARD SODISM solar telescope
(Meftah et al. 2013) require dark signal correction and hot pixel
identification. Its frame transfer E2V 42-80 CCD operates at -7{\deg}C. Both
image and memory zones thus accumulate dark current during, respectively,
integration and readout time. These two components must be separated to
estimate the dark signal for any observation. This is the purpose of the Dark
Signal Model presented in this paper. The dark signal time series of every
pixel is processed by the Unbalanced Haar Technique (Fryzlewicz 2007) in order
to timestamp when its dark signal is expected to change. In-between those
instants, both components are assumed constant and a robust linear regression
vs. integration time provides first estimates and a quality coefficient. The
latter serves to assign definitive estimates. Our model is part of the SODISM
Level 1 data production scheme. To check its reliability, we verify on dark
frames that it leaves a negligible residual bias (5 e-), and generates a small
RMS error (25 e- rms). The cool pixel level is found to be 4 e-/pxl/s, in
agreement with the predicted value. The emergence rate of hot pixels is
investigated too. It legitimates a threshold criterion at 50 e-/pxl/s. The
growth rate is found to be 4% of the frame area per year. Aspects of the method
(adaptation of the Unbalanced Haar Technique, dedicated robust linear
regression) have a generic interest.

Whilst this is a fascinating development the resulting S-matrix is not
explicitly unitary. The problem has been known for a long time in the context
of S-matrices related to quantum groups. A braiding relation often called
""unitarity"" actually only corresponds to quantum field theory unitarity when
the S-matrix is Hermitian analytic and quantum group S-matrices manifestly
violate this. On the other hand, overall consistency of the S-matrix under the
bootstrap requires that the deformation parameter is a root of unity and
consequently one is forced to perform the ""vertex"" to IRF, or SOS,
transformation on the states to truncate the spectrum consistently. In the IRF
formulation unitarity is now manifest and the string S-matrix and the S-matrix

voltage in a QD system with a different number of quantum states in the dot
region in presence of Coulombic interaction between the quantum dot and two
leads. We extended the NEGF treatment developed for noninteracting leads onto
the case of four quantum states $m =\{\sigma,\lambda\}=\{\pm,\pm\}$ interacting
with leads. Our derivation is based on the equation-of-motion technique and
Langreth's theorem. For a Coulombic repulsion between the contacts and QD we
obtain an expression for the current through QD for the four quantum states. To
determine the parameters of the model Hamiltonian we used our previous
calculations [1] of the electronic properties of a symmetrical nanotube QD
(5,5)/(10,0)\_1/(5,5) in a tight binding model, where \_1 denotes the length of
the middle QD segment of a (10,0) zigzag nanotube. We calculated the density of
electronic states with spin up and down for the case of a single QD without
pseudospin states for an infinite Coulomb repulsion, in good agreement with the
calculations of Yuan Li, et al. [2]. Our calculation showed that the position
of the conductance peaks nearest to zero is not affected by the strength of the
QD-lead Coulombic interaction parameters. We also demonstrated that this
interaction shifts the density of states to higher energies. The interplay
between the Kondo effect and the bias is highly temperature-dependent and
becomes significant only at low temperatures. Lastly, we found that the
existence of four quantum states $m=\{\sigma,\lambda\}$ leads to abrupt changes
in the density of states. In this case the values of the current are
approximately ten times lower than for QD with only two quantum states $m
=\{\sigma\}=\{\pm\}$. However, in the case of a conventional bias the current
amplitudes in both cases are approximately the same.

or even likely possibility. This hypothesis leads to testable consequences,
perhaps portending the discovery of a rich hidden world neighboring our own. We
consider a scenario that readily satisfies current bounds that we call
Partially Interacting Dark Matter (PIDM). This scenario contains
self-interacting dark matter, but it is not the dominant component. Even if
PIDM contains only a fraction of the net dark matter density, comparable to the
baryonic fraction, the subdominant component's interactions can lead to
interesting and potentially observable consequences. Our primary focus will be
the special case of Double-Disk Dark Matter (DDDM), in which self-interactions
allow the dark matter to lose enough energy to lead to dynamics similar to
those in the baryonic sector. We explore a simple model in which DDDM can cool
efficiently and form a disk within galaxies, and we evaluate some of the
possible observational signatures. The most prominent signal of such a scenario
could be an enhanced indirect detection signature with a distinctive spatial
distribution. Even though subdominant, the enhanced density at the center of
the galaxy and possibly throughout the plane of the galaxy can lead to large
boost factors, and could even explain a signature as large as the 130 GeV Fermi
line. Such scenarios also predict additional dark radiation degrees of freedom
that could soon be detectable and would influence the interpretation of future
data, such as that from Planck and from the Gaia satellite. We consider this to

additional electroweak fields. It is well established that these new fields may
modify Higgs gamma-gamma and gamma-Z decays at one-loop. However, one
unexplored aspect of such scenarios is that by electroweak symmetry one should
also expect modifications to the Higgs Z-Z coupling at one-loop and, more
generally, modifications to Higgs production and decay channels beyond
tree-level. In this paper we investigate the full BSM modified electroweak
corrections to associated Higgs production at both the LHC and a future lepton
collider in two simple SM extensions. From both inclusive and differential NLO
associated production cross sections we find BSM-NLO corrections can be as
large as O(>10%) when compared to the SM expectation, consistent with other
precision electroweak measurements, even in scenarios where modifications to
the Higgs diphoton rate are not significant. At the LHC such corrections are
comparable to the involved QCD uncertainties. At a lepton collider the Higgs
associated production cross section can be measured to high accuracy (O(1%)
independent of uncertainties in total width and other couplings), and such a
deviation could be easily observed even if the new states remain beyond
kinematic reach. This should be compared to the expected accuracy for a
model-independent determination of the Higgs diphoton coupling at a lepton
collider, which is O(15%). This work demonstrates that precision measurements
of the Higgs associated production cross section constitute a powerful probe of
modified Higgs sectors and will be valuable for indirectly exploring BSM
scenarios.

mass, moment of inertia, and quadrupole moment to quadratic order in spin. In
principle, all of these quantities depend on the neutron star's internal
structure, and thus, on unknown nuclear physics at supra-nuclear energy
densities. We here find relations between the moment of inertia, the Love
numbers and the quadrupole moment (I-Love-Q relations) that do not depend
sensitively on the neutron star's internal structure. Three important
consequences derive from these I-Love-Q relations. On an observational
astrophysics front, the measurement of a single member of the I-Love-Q trio
would automatically provide information about the other two, even when the
latter may not be observationally accessible. On a gravitational wave front,
the I-Love-Q relations break the degeneracy between the quadrupole moment and
the neutron-star spins in binary inspiral waveforms, allowing second-generation
ground-based detectors to determine the (dimensionless) averaged spin to
$\mathcal{O}(10)%$, given a sufficiently large signal-to-noise ratio detection.
On a fundamental physics front, the I-Love-Q relations allow for tests of
General Relativity in the neutron-star strong-field that are both theory- and
internal structure-independent. As an example, by combining gravitational-wave

Variability is seen preferentially in the unsaturated P V and Si IV lines, but
also in saturated C III and O VI lines. The CSPNe with variable P Cygni
profiles have similar stellar properties (relatively low log(g) and T_eff) that
suggests they are less evolved CSPNe. Some of the CSPNe with variable P Cygni

number of 3.3-4.6. Here, we present results from a deep XMM-Newton observation
of the cluster. We observe two distinct cluster cores that have survived the
merger. The presence of three shocks at or near the locations of the radio
relics is confirmed by density and temperature discontinuities. However, the
observation poses several puzzles that challenge our understanding of radio
relics: (i) at the Toothbrush, the shock Mach number is not larger than 2, in
apparent conflict with the shock strength predicted from the radio spectrum;
(ii) at the Toothbrush, the shock front is, in part, spatially offset from the
radio emission; (iii) at the eastern relic, we detect a temperature jump
corresponding to a Mach number of approximately 2.5, but there is no associated
surface brightness discontinuity. We discuss possible explanations for these
findings.

The DFs take the form $f(E)$, are dynamically stable, and are generated within
triaxial potentials corresponding directly to subhaloes formed in cosmological
dark-matter-only simulations of Milky Way and galaxy cluster haloes.
Additionally, we consider the effect of different tracer number density
profiles (cuspy and cored) on the inferred slopes of mass profiles. For the
isotropic DFs considered here, we find that halo triaxiality tends to introduce
an anti-correlation between $R_e$ and $\sigma$ when estimated for a variety of
viewing angles. The net effect is a negligible contribution to the systematic
error associated with the slope of the mass profile, which continues to be
dominated by a bias toward greater overestimation of masses for
more-concentrated tracer populations. We demonstrate that simple mass estimates
for two distinct tracer populations can give reliable (and cosmologically
meaningful) lower limits for $\Gamma$, irrespective of the degree of
triaxiality or shape of the tracer number density profile.

then the structure of the action principle for gravity should encode this fact.
With this motivation we study several features of the Einstein-Hilbert action
and establish direct connections with horizon thermodynamics. We begin by
introducing the concept of holographically conjugate variables (HCVs) in terms
of which the surface term in the action has a specific relationship with the
bulk term. In addition to g_{ab} and its conjugate momentum \sqrt{-g} M^{cab},
this procedure allows us to (re)discover and motivate strongly the use of
f^{ab}=\sqrt{-g}g^{ab} and its conjugate momentum N^c_{ab}. The gravitational
action can then be interpreted as a momentum space action for these variables.
We also show that many expressions in classical gravity simplify considerably
in this approach. For example, the field equations can be written in a form
analogous to Hamilton's equations for a suitable Hamiltonian if we use these
variables. More importantly, the variation of the surface term, evaluated on
any null surface which acts a local Rindler horizon can be given a direct
thermodynamic interpretation. The term involving the variation of the dynamical
variable leads to T\delta S while the term involving the variation of the
conjugate momentum leads to S\delta T. We have found this correspondence only
for the choice of variables (g_{ab}, \sqrt{-g} M^{cab}) or (f^{ab}, N^c_{ab}).
We use this result to provide a direct thermodynamical interpretation of the
boundary condition in the action principle, when it is formulated in a
spacetime region bounded by the null surfaces. We analyse these features from
several different perspectives and provide a detailed description, which offers
insights about the nature of classical gravity and emergent paradigm.

H-beta emission. He D3 (5876 Angstrom) broadens, coupled with an increase in
flux. Two hours after the X-ray accretion event, the optical veiling increases
due to continuum emission from the hot splashdown region. The response of the
stellar coronal emission to the heated photosphere follows about 2.4 hours
later, giving direct evidence that the stellar corona is heated in part by
accretion. Then, the stellar wind becomes re-established. A model that
incorporates the dynamics of this sequential series of events includes: an
accretion shock, a cooling downflow in a supersonically turbulent region,
followed by photospheric and later, coronal heating. This model naturally
explains the presence of broad optical and ultraviolet lines, and affects the
mass accretion rates currently determined from emission line profiles. These
results, coupled with the large heated coronal region revealed from X-ray
diagnostics, suggest that current models are not adequate to explain the
accretion process in young stars.

composite objects that naturally leads to these axioms being satisfied. In any

how wide it is, and so on). We associate a generalized state with an object.
This can be used to calculate the value of those properties we are interested

Hall regime for GaAs and graphene that takes into account Landau level mixing
(for both GaAs and graphene) and subband mixing (for GaAs, due to the nonzero
width of the quantum well). This mixing has the important qualitative effect of
breaking particle-hole symmetry as well as renormalizing the strength of the
interparticle interactions. Both effects could have important consequences for
the prospect that the fractional quantum Hall effect at $\nu=5/2$ is described
by states that support non-Abelian excitations such as the Moore-Read Pfaffian
or anti-Pfaffian states. For GaAs, Landau level and subband mixing break
particle-hole symmetry in all Landau levels and subband mixing, due to finite
thickness, causes additional short-distance softening of the Coulomb
interaction, further renormalizing the Hamiltonian; additionally, the Landau
level and subband energy spacings are comparable so it is crucial to consider
both effects simultaneously. We find that in graphene, Landau level mixing only
breaks particle-hole symmetry outside of the lowest Landau level ($N\neq0$).
Landau level mixing is likely to be especially important in graphene since the
Landau level mixing parameter is independent of the external magnetic field and
is of order one. Our realistic Hamiltonians will serve as starting points for
future numerical studies.

by the inclusion of an intense radiation source. In some contexts, such the
breakout of a gamma-ray burst jet from a star, the outflow is heated to a high
temperature at a large optical depth. Eventually it becomes transparent and is
pushed to a higher Lorentz factor by a combination of the Lorentz force and
radiation pressure. We obtain its profile, both inside and outside the fast
magnetosonic critical point, when the poloidal magnetic field is radial and
monopolar. Most of the energy flux is carried by the radiation field and the
toroidal magnetic field that is wound up close to the rapidly rotating engine.
Although the entrained matter carries little energy, it couples the radiation
field to the magnetic field. Then the fast critical point is pushed inward from
infinity and, above a critical radiation intensity, the outflow is accelerated
mainly by radiation pressure. We identify a distinct observational signature of
this hybrid outflow: a hardening of the radiation spectrum above the peak of
the seed photon distribution, driven by bulk Compton scattering. The
non-thermal spectrum -- obtained by a Monte Carlo method -- is most extended
when the Lorentz force dominates the acceleration, and the seed photon beam is
wider than the Lorentz cone of the MHD fluid. This effect is a generic feature
of hot, magnetized outflows interacting with slower relativistic material. It
may explain why some GRB spectra appear to peak at photon energies above the
original Amati et al. scaling. A companion paper addresses the case of jet
breakout, where diverging magnetic flux surfaces yield strong MHD acceleration
over a wider range of Lorentz factor.

a compact, relativistic jet. The entrained matter accelerates outward as the
jet breaks out of a star or other confining medium. In some circumstances, such
as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), the magnetization of the jet is greatly reduced by
an advected radiation field while the jet is optically thick to scattering.
Where magnetic flux surfaces diverge rapidly, a strong outward Lorentz force
develops and radiation and matter begin to decouple. The increase in
magnetization is coupled to a rapid growth in Lorentz factor. We take two
approaches to this problem. The first examines the flow outside the fast
magnetosonic critical surface, and calculates the flow speed and the angular
distribution of the radiation field over a range of scattering depths. The
second considers the flow structure on both sides of the critical surface in
the optically thin regime, using a relaxation method. In both approaches, we
find how the terminal Lorentz factor, and radial profile of the outflow, depend
on the radiation intensity and optical depth at breakout. The effect of bulk
Compton scattering on the radiation spectrum is calculated by a Monte Carlo
method, while neglecting the effects of internal dissipation. The peak of the
scattered spectrum sits near the seed peak if radiation pressure dominates the
acceleration, but is pushed to a higher frequency if the Lorentz force
dominates, and especially if the seed photon cone is broadened by interaction
with a slower component of the outflow.

1600, 2993 and 3181 cm$^{-1}$ in Raman spectra, strongly indicating that
phenanthrene has transformed into amorphous hydrogenated carbon. Based on x-ray
diffraction, the structures of corresponding phases observed in Raman spectra
are identified with space group of $P_{\rm}2_{1}$ for phase I at 0-2.2 GPa,
$P_{\rm}$2/\emph{m} for phase II at 2.2-5.6 GPa and
$P_{\rm}$2/\emph{m}+\emph{Pmmm} for phase III at 5.6-11.4 GPa, and the
structure above 11.4 GPa is identified with space group of \emph{Pmmm}.
Although phenanthrene has amorphized above 20.0 GPa, the amorphous hydrogenated
carbon clusters still remain the crystalline characteristic based on x-ray
diffraction patterns. Our results suggest that the long-range periodicity and
the local disorder state coexist in phenanthrene at high pressures.

We compare the parameters generated from forward fitting a homogeneous source

original parameters used in the model and with parameters generated from
forward fitting a homogeneous source model to the original (unfolded) image

variation of parameters along the line of sight, which are ignored in the

played an important role in the reionization of the Universe. Local galaxies
exhibiting LyC leakage could shed light on the escape mechanisms, but so far
only two such cases have been identified. Here we want to investigate whether
the lack of local LyC emitters can be caused in part by biased selection
criteria (e.g. strong H-alpha emission), and we present a novel method of
selecting targets with high escape fractions. By applying these criteria, we
assemble a sample of observation targets to study their basic properties.
  We introduce a new strategy where potential LyC leakers are selected by their
blue colours and weak (instead of strong) emission lines. We take a closer look
at 8 LyC leaking candidates at z ~ 0.03, selected from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS), which we observe with ESO/NTT in broadband B and H-alpha. We
find that 7 of the 8 galaxies are involved in interaction with neighbours or
show signs of mergers. In 7 cases the young stellar population is clearly
displaced from the main body of the galaxies. Half of our targets show
absorption spectra with post-starburst signatures. The scale lengths in H-alpha
are typically 30% smaller than those of the stellar continua, indicating ram
pressure stripping. We tentatively identify a few conditions favourable for
leakage: 1) the combined effects of ram pressure stripping with supernova winds
from young stars formed in the front, 2) merger events that increase the star
formation rate and displace stars from gas, 3) starbursts in the centres of
post-starburst galaxies, and 4) a low dust content.

oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) time-series for the
time period 1900-2012 in order to investigate plausible manifestation of sharp
increases in temperature.
  It was found that the widely observed warming in the past century did not
occur smoothly but sharply. This fact is more pronounced at the latitude zone
30S - 60N during the years 1925/1926 and 1987/1988. We hypothesise that there
were two major climate regime shifts in 1925/1926 and 1987/1988 years. During
these shifts the mean value of temperature rises, over which natural
variability associated with ENSO, PDO and other factors occurs. During each
sharp increase mean SST in tropics/north middle latitudes increased by about
0.28/0.36 {\deg}C. Most of other temperature anomalies are explained by ENSO
and PDO. The existence of these shifts tends to be masked by natural
variability.
  This hypothesis has allowed us to develop very simple linear regression
models which explain the main features of temperature anomalies from 30oS to
60oN observed in the past century. Additionally, two remarkable outcomes
revealed from this analysis. The first one is that linear regression
coefficients can be calculated by employing a limited length of the temperature
time-series (e.g., from 1910 till 1940) and reproduce quite well the whole
time-series from 1900 up to now. The second one is that a good quality of
reproduction is achieved by using only two factors (ENSO/PDO and sharp changes
for tropics/northern middle altitudes).

continuum-fitting method. These black holes are located in two distinct classes
of X-ray binary systems, one that is persistently X-ray bright and another that
is transient. Both the persistent and transient black holes remain for long
periods in a state where their spectra are dominated by a thermal accretion
disk component. The spin of a black hole of known mass and distance can be
measured by fitting this thermal continuum spectrum to the thin-disk model of
Novikov and Thorne; the key fit parameter is the radius of the inner edge of
the black hole's accretion disk. Strong observational and theoretical evidence
links the inner-disk radius to the radius of the innermost stable circular
orbit, which is trivially related to the dimensionless spin parameter a_* of
the black hole (|a_*| < 1). The ten spins that have so far been measured by
this continuum-fitting method range widely from a_* \approx 0 to a_* > 0.95.
The robustness of the method is demonstrated by the dozens or hundreds of
independent and consistent measurements of spin that have been obtained for
several black holes, and through careful consideration of many sources of
systematic error. Among the results discussed is a dichotomy between the

exceedingly important. A fundamental problem in analyzing trajectory data is
that of identifying common patterns between pairs or among groups of
trajectories. In this paper, we consider the problem of identifying similar
portions between a pair of trajectories, each observed as a sequence of points
sampled from it.
  We present new measures of trajectory similarity --- both local and global
--- between a pair of trajectories to distinguish between similar and
dissimilar portions. Our model is robust under noise and outliers, it does not
make any assumptions on the sampling rates on either trajectory, and it works
even if they are partially observed. Additionally, the model also yields a
scalar similarity score which can be used to rank multiple pairs of
trajectories according to similarity, e.g. in clustering applications. We also
present efficient algorithms for computing the similarity under our measures;
the worst-case running time is quadratic in the number of sample points.
  Finally, we present an extensive experimental study evaluating the
effectiveness of our approach on real datasets, comparing with it with earlier
approaches, and illustrating many issues that arise in trajectory data. Our
experiments show that our approach is highly accurate in distinguishing similar
and dissimilar portions as compared to earlier methods even with sparse

Consequently some form of nonlinearity is required to gain any advantage beyond

components of the filament network to the spin alignment signal. We discuss a
unifying picture to describe the alignment of haloes in filaments and walls
consistent with previous results and our findings based on a two-phase angular
momentum acquisition, first via tidal torquening and later via anisotropic mass
accretion. The hierarchical identification and characterization of cosmic
structures was done with a new implementation of the Multiscale Morphology
Filter. The MMF-2 (introduced here) represents a significant improvement over
its predecessor in terms of robustness and by explicitly describing the
hierarchical relations between the elements of the Cosmic Web.

to construct a dual certificate. Unfortunately, dual certificates may not exist
under some formulations of semidefinite programs. In order to put problems into
a form where dual certificate arguments are possible, it is important to
develop conditions under which the certificates exist. In this paper, we
provide an example where dual certificates do not exist. We then present a

important message of this paper is that dual certificates may not exist for
semidefinite programs that involve orthogonal measurements with respect to
positive-semidefinite matrices. Such measurements can interact with the
positive-semidefinite constraint in a way that implies additional linear
measurements. If these additional measurements are not included in the problem

density is anti-correlated with the linear extent of the background radio
source. We investigate this interpretation, by dissecting the various
parameters from which the column density is derived, and find that the
relationship is driven primarily by the observed optical depth, which, for a
given absorber size, is anti-correlated with the linear size. Therefore, the
inferred anti-correlation is merely the consequence of geometry, in conjunction
with the assumption of a common spin temperature/covering factor ratio for each
member of the sample, an assumption for which there is scant observational
justification. While geometry can explain the observed correlation, many radio
sources comprise two radio lobes and so we model the projected area of a two
component emitter intercepted by a foreground absorber. From this, the observed
optical depth/linear size relationship is best reproduced through models which
approximate either of the two Fanaroff & Riley classifications, although the
observed scatter in the sample cannot be duplicated using a single deprojected
radio source size. Furthermore, the trend is best reproduced using an absorber
of diameter ~100 - 1000 pc, which is also the range of values of linear sizes
at which the 21-cm detection rate peaks. This may indicate that this is the
characteristic linear size of the absorbing gas structure.

domain. The aggregate-size distribution is accurately derived using the
null-method of box-counting on the occurrences of system components. The
importance of the aggregate-size spectrum relies on its ability to reveal
system form, function, and dynamics also as a function of other coupled
systems. Variations of the fractal dimension and of the aggregate-size
distribution are related to changes of systems that are meaningful to monitor
because potentially critical for these systems.

physicists usually add terms linear in dot{E}, the material time derivative of
the Lagrangian strain tensor E, to the elastic stress tensor sigma derived from
the expansion to the third- (sometimes fourth-) order of the strain energy
density e=e(trace(E), trace(E^2), trace(E^3)). Here, it is shown that this
practice, which has been widely used in the past three decades or so, is
physically wrong for at least two reasons, and that it should be corrected. One
reason is that the elastic stress tensor sigma is not symmetric while dot{E) is
symmetric, so that motions for which sigma + sigma^T <> 0 will give rise to
elastic stresses which have no viscous pendant. Another reason is that dot{E}
is frame-invariant, while sigma is not, so that an observer transformation
would alter the elastic part of the total stress differently than it would
alter the dissipative part, thereby violating the fundamental principle of
material frame-indifference. These problems can have serious consequences for
nonlinear shear wave propagation in soft solids, as seen here with an example
of a kink in almost incompressible soft solids.

standard $\Lambda$CDM model as the fiducial model, we constrain the jerk models
with the observational Hubble parameter data (OHD) and Type Ia Supernovae (SNe)

zero and the $\Lambda$CDM is well accommodated by the jerk reconstruction. We
also compare the powers of OHD and SNe in constraining the jerk models in
detail, and find that the newly released OHD measurement at $z=2.3$ can improve
the constraint significantly, even tighter than the SNe one. Furthermore, we
analyze the jerk models by calculating the Hubble parameter, equation of state,
the deceleration factor and $Om(z)$ diagnostic. Our results show that the
universe is indeed undergoing an accelerated expansion phase following the
matter-dominated one, which is consistent with the standard model by

considerable attention during the past few years. Most of the relevant
literature focuses on holistic descriptors in closed-set identification
applications. The underlying assumption in SR-based methods is that each class
in the gallery has sufficient samples and the query lies on the subspace
spanned by the gallery of the same class. Unfortunately, such assumption is
easily violated in the more challenging face verification scenario, where an
algorithm is required to determine if two faces (where one or both have not
been seen before) belong to the same person. In this paper, we first discuss
why previous attempts with SR might not be applicable to verification problems.
We then propose an alternative approach to face verification via SR.
Specifically, we propose to use explicit SR encoding on local image patches
rather than the entire face. The obtained sparse signals are pooled via
averaging to form multiple region descriptors, which are then concatenated to
form an overall face descriptor. Due to the deliberate loss spatial relations
within each region (caused by averaging), the resulting descriptor is robust to
misalignment & various image deformations. Within the proposed framework, we
evaluate several SR encoding techniques: l1-minimisation, Sparse Autoencoder
Neural Network (SANN), and an implicit probabilistic technique based on
Gaussian Mixture Models. Thorough experiments on AR, FERET, exYaleB, BANCA and
ChokePoint datasets show that the proposed local SR approach obtains
considerably better and more robust performance than several previous
state-of-the-art holistic SR methods, in both verification and closed-set
identification problems. The experiments also show that l1-minimisation based
encoding has a considerably higher computational than the other techniques, but
leads to higher recognition rates.

spectrum in the MeV to GeV range. In the TeV range, a photon index of 3.89 +-
0.37 (stat) +- 0.22 (sys) and a flux normalisation at 1 TeV, Phi(1 TeV) = (3.5
+- 1.1 (stat) +- 0.9 (sys)) x 10^{-13} cm^{-2} s^{-1} TeV^{-1}, were found. The
detection with H.E.S.S. triggered observations in the X-ray band with the Swift
and RXTE telescopes. Simultaneous UV and optical data from Swift UVOT and data
from the optical telescopes ATOM and ROTSE are also available. The spectrum and
light curve measured with H.E.S.S. are presented and compared to the
multi-wavelength data at lower energies. A rapid flare is seen in the Swift XRT
and RXTE data, together with a flux variation in the UV band, at a time scale
of the order of one day. A firm upper limit of z < 0.59 on the redshift of PKS
0447-439 is derived from the combined Fermi-LAT and H.E.S.S. data, given the
assumptions that there is no upturn in the intrinsic spectrum above the
Fermi-LAT energy range and that absorption on the Extragalactic Background
Light (EBL) is not weaker than the lower limit provided by current models. The
spectral energy distribution is well described by a simple one-zone Synchrotron
Self-Compton (SSC) scenario, if the redshift of the source is less than z <~
0.4.

to the well-known Damon-Eshbach surface mode, the sense of the rotation depends
not only on the direction of the field but also on the strength of the field;
its chiral direction is generally determined by the sum of the so-called Chern

$G_1$ and $G_2$ whether $G_1$ can be embedded such that its dual is isomorphic
to $G_2$. Our algorithmic main result is an NP-completeness proof for the
general case and a linear-time algorithm for biconnected graphs. To shed light
onto the combinatorial structure of the duals of a planar graph, we consider
the \emph{common dual relation} $\sim$, where $G_1 \sim G_2$ if and only if
they have a common dual. While $\sim$ is generally not transitive, we show that
the restriction to biconnected graphs is an equivalence relation. In this case,
being dual to each other carries over to the equivalence classes, i.e., two
graphs are dual to each other if and only if any two elements of their
respective equivalence classes are dual to each other.
  To achieve the efficient testing algorithm for \mpd on biconnected graphs, we
devise a succinct representation of the equivalence class of a biconnected
planar graph. It is similar to SPQR-trees and represents exactly the graphs
that are contained in the equivalence class. The testing algorithm then works
by testing in linear time whether two such representations are isomorphic. We
note that a special case of \mpd is testing whether a graph $G$ is self-dual.
Our algorithm handles the case where $G$ is biconnected and our NP-hardness
proof extends to testing self-duality of general planar graphs and also to
testing map self-duality, where a graph $G$ is map self-dual if it admits a
planar embedding $\mathcal G$ such that $G^\star$ is isomorphic to $G$, and
additionally the embedding induced by $\mathcal G$ on $G^\star$ is $\mathcal
G$.

minimum outage probability sense, for a given energy transfer constraint. A
close-to-optimal selection method that is easier to analyze than the optimal
one is also examined. Closed-form expressions for the capacity-energy and the
outage-energy tradeoffs of the developed schemes are provided and corroborated
by simulations. Interesting insights on the aforementioned tradeoffs are
obtained.

nova-like eclipsing star 2MASS J01074282+4845188. To obtain a light curve
solution we used model of a nova-like star whose emission sources are a white
dwarf surrounded by an accretion disk, a secondary star filling its Roche lobe,
a hot spot and a hot line. 2MASS J01074282+4845188 shows the deepest permanent
eclipse among the known nova-like stars. It is reproduced by covering the very
bright accretion disk by the secondary component. The luminosity of the disk is
much bigger than that of the rest light sources. The determined high
temperature of the disk is typical for that observed during the outbursts of
CVs. The primary of 2MASS J01074282+4845188 is one of the hottest white dwarfs
in CVs. The temperature of 5090 K of its secondary is also quite high and more
appropriate for a long-period SW Sex star. It might be explained by the intense
heating from the hot white dwarf and the hot accretion disk of the target. The
high mass accretion rate $\dot{M} = 8\times 10^{-9} M_{\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$, the
broad and single-peaked H$\alpha$ emission profile, and the presence of an
S-wave are sure signs for the SW Sex classification of 2MASS J01074282+4845188.
The obtained flat temperature distribution along the disk radius as well as the
deviation of the energy distribution from the black-body law are evidence of
the non-steady emission of the disk. The close values of the disk temperature
and the parameter $\alpha_{g}$ of 2MASS J01074282+4845188 and those of the
cataclysmic stars at eruptions might be considered as an additional argument
for the permanent active state of nova-like stars.

H$_2$O masers in the high-mass star-forming region of \objectname{W75N},
carried out with VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry (VERA) for three-epochs
in 2007 with an angular resolution of $\sim$ 1 mas. We detected H$_2$O maser
emission toward the radio jet in VLA 1 and the expanding shell-like structure
in VLA 2. We have made elliptical fits to the VLA 2 H$_2$O maser shell-like
structure observed in the different epochs (1999, 2005, and 2007), and found
that the shell is still expanding eight years after its discovery. From the
difference in the size of the semi-major axes of the fitted ellipses in the
epochs 1999 ($\simeq$ 71$\pm$1 mas), 2005 ($\simeq$ 97$\pm$3 mas), and 2007
($\simeq$ 111$\pm$1 mas), we estimate an average expanding velocity of $\sim$ 5
mas yr$^{-1}$, similar to the proper motions measured in the individual H$_2$O
maser features. A kinematic age of $\sim$ 20 yr is derived for this structure.
In addition, our VERA observations indicate an increase in the ellipticity of
the expanding shell around VLA 2 from epochs 1999 to 2007. In fact, the
elliptical fit of the VERA data shows a ratio between the minor and major axes
of $\sim$ 0.6, in contrast with a most circular shape for the shell detected in
1999 and 2005 (b/a $\sim$ 0.9). This suggests that we are probably observing
the formation of a jet-driven H$_2$O maser structure in VLA2, evolving from a
non-collimated pulsed-outflow event during the first stages of evolution of a
massive young stellar object (YSO). This may support predictions made earlier
by other authors on this issue, consistent with recent magnetohydrodynamical
simulations. We discuss possible implications of our results in the study of

the period of the fundamental mode to twice the one of its first overtone,
$P_1/2P_2$, plays an important role. We examine how field-aligned flows affect
the dispersion properties, and hence the period ratios, of standing modes
supported by magnetic slabs in the solar atmosphere. We numerically solve the
dispersion relations and devise a graphic means to construct standing modes.
For coronal slabs, we find that the flow effects are significant, for the fast
kink and sausage modes alike. For the kink ones, they may reduce $P_1/2P_2$ by
up to 23% compared with the static case, and the minimum allowed $P_1/2P_2$ can
fall below the lower limit analytically derived for static slabs. For the
sausage modes, while introducing the flow reduces $P_1/2P_2$ by typically
$\lesssim 5$ % relative to the static case, it significantly increases the
threshold aspect ratio only above which standing sausage modes can be
supported, meaning that their detectability is restricted to even wider slabs.
In the case of photospheric slabs, the flow effect is not as strong. However,
standing modes are distinct from the coronal case in that standing kink modes
show a $P_1/2P_2$ that deviates from unity even for a zero-width slab, while
standing sausage modes no longer suffer from a threshold aspect ratio. We
conclude that transverse structuring in plasma density and flow speed should be
considered in seismological applications of multiple periodicities to solar
atmospheric structures.

weighted voting game can increase her power by splitting into several players
and distributing her weight among these false identities. Analogously to this
splitting problem, the beneficial merging problem asks whether a coalition of
players can increase their power in a weighted voting game by merging their
weights. Aziz et al. [ABEP11] analyze the problem of whether merging or
splitting players in weighted voting games is beneficial in terms of the
Shapley-Shubik and the normalized Banzhaf index, and so do Rey and Rothe [RR10]
for the probabilistic Banzhaf index. All these results provide merely
NP-hardness lower bounds for these problems, leaving the question about their
exact complexity open. For the Shapley--Shubik and the probabilistic Banzhaf
index, we raise these lower bounds to hardness for PP, ""probabilistic
polynomial time"", and provide matching upper bounds for beneficial merging and,
whenever the number of false identities is fixed, also for beneficial

from our results that beneficial merging and splitting for these two power
indices cannot be solved in NP, unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses,

between 6 and 20nm. The degree of spin-polarization of the current flowing in
the plane of the film is measured through the current induced spin wave Doppler
shift. We find that it decreases as the film thickness decreases, from 0.72 at
20nm to 0.46 at 6nm. This decrease is attributed to a spin depolarization
induced by the film surfaces. A model is proposed which takes into account the
contributions of the different sources of electron scattering (alloy disorder,
phonons, thermal magnons, grain boundaries, film surfaces) to the measured
spin-dependent resistivities.

two-user MIMO interference channel, in which each receiver either decodes the
incoming information data (information decoding, ID) or harvests the RF energy

In the two-user interference channel, we have four different scenarios
according to the receiver mode -- ($ID_1$, $ID_2$), ($EH_1$, $EH_2$), ($EH_1$,
$ID_2$), and ($ID_1$, $EH_2$). While the maximum information bit rate is
unknown and finding the optimal transmission strategy is still open for
($ID_1$, $ID_2$), we have derived the optimal transmission strategy achieving
the maximum harvested energy for ($EH_1$, $EH_2$). For ($EH_1$, $ID_2$), and
($ID_1$, $EH_2$), we find a necessary condition of the optimal transmission
strategy and, accordingly, identify the achievable rate-energy (R-E) tradeoff
region for two transmission strategies that satisfy the necessary condition -
maximum energy beamforming (MEB) and minimum leakage beamforming (MLB).
Furthermore, a new transmission strategy satisfying the necessary condition -
signal-to-leakage-and-energy ratio (SLER) maximization beamforming - is
proposed and shown to exhibit a better R-E region than the MEB and the MLB
strategies. Finally, we propose a mode scheduling method to switch between
($EH_1$, $ID_2$) and ($ID_1$, $EH_2$) based on the SLER.

paradigm in medical research where new cases are solved relying on previously
solved similar cases. Usually, a database of solved cases is provided, and
every case is described through a set of attributes (inputs) and a label
(output). Extracting useful information from this database can help the CBR
system providing more reliable results on the yet to be solved cases.
Objective. For that purpose we suggest a general frame- work where a CBR
system, viz. K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) algorithm, is combined with various
information obtained from a Logistic Regression (LR) model. Methods. LR is
applied, on the case database, to assign weights to the attributes as well as
the solved cases. Thus, five possible decision making systems based on K-NN
and/or LR were identified: a standalone K-NN, a standalone LR and three soft
K-NN algorithms that rely on the weights based on the results of the LR. The
evaluation of the described approaches is performed in the field of renal
transplant access waiting list. Results and conclusion. The results show that
our suggested approach, where the K-NN algorithm relies on both weighted
attributes and cases, can efficiently deal with non relevant attributes,
whereas the four other approaches suffer from this kind of noisy setups. The
robustness of this approach suggests interesting perspectives for medical
problem solving tools using CBR methodology.

its properties to an anisotropy measure based on the mean diffusivity and the
asymptotic decay of the distribution. Both quantities are easy to determine

We aim at detecting signatures of an aspherical outflow, as well as to derive
the properties of it. Methods. We use the imaging polarimeter ExPo (the extreme
polarimeter), a visitor instrument at the William Herschel Telescope, to
accurately image the dust shell surrounding HD 161796 in various wavelength
filters. Imaging polarimetry allows us to separate the faint, polarized, light
from circumstellar material from the bright, unpolarized, light from the
central star. Results. The shell around HD 161796 is highly aspherical. A clear
signature of an equatorial density enhancement can be seen. This structure is
optically thick at short wavelengths and changes its appearance to optically
thin at longer wavelengths. In the classification of the two different
appearances of planetary nebulae from HST images it changes from being
classified as DUPLEX at short wavelengths to SOLE at longer wavelengths. This
strengthens the interpretation that these two appearances are manifestations of
the same physical structure. Furthermore, we find that the central star is
hotter than often assumed and the relatively high observed reddening is due to
circumstellar rather than interstellar extinction.

existence of hidden symmetries generated by a second rank conformal Killing

is conformally related to the original spacetime metric and admits a complete
separability structure, we construct the explicit expression for the conformal
Killing tensor. Next, we study the properties of the geodesic motion in the

thermal equilibrium acquires electric charge in an external magnetic field. To
this end the fermions should have an additional quantum number, isospin or
color, and should be subject to a second magnetic field, which distinguishes
the isospin/color, as well as to a corresponding isospin chemical potential.
The role of the latter can be also played by a nontrivial holonomy (Polyakov
loop) along the Euclidean time direction. The charge is accumulated since the
degeneracies of occupied lowest Landau levels for particles of positive isospin
and anti-particles of negative isospin are different. We discuss two physical
systems, where this phenomenon can be realized. One is monolayer graphene,
where the isospin is associated with two valleys in the Brillouin zone and the
strain-induced pseudo-magnetic field acts differently on charge carriers in
different valleys. Another is hot QCD, for which the relevant non-Abelian field
configurations with both nonzero chromo-magnetic field and a nontrivial
Polyakov loop can be realized as calorons - topological solutions of Yang-Mills
equations at finite temperature. The induced electric charge on the caloron
field configuration is studied numerically. We argue that due to the
fluctuations of holonomy external magnetic field should tend to suppress charge
fluctuations in the quark-gluon plasma and estimate the importance of this
effect for off-central heavy-ion collisions.

for explaining the angular velocity profile in the Sun and in solar-type
main-sequence and evolved stars, due to their role in the transport of angular
momentum. Our bringing concerns critical layers, a process poorly explored in
stellar physics, defined as the location where the local relative frequency of
a given wave to the rotational frequency of the fluid tends to zero (i.e that
corresponds to co-rotation resonances). IGW propagate through stably-stratified
radiative regions, where they extract or deposit angular momentum through two
processes: radiative and viscous dampings and critical layers. Our goal is to
obtain a complete picture of the effects of this latters. First, we expose a
mathematical resolution of the equation of propagation for IGWs in adiabatic
and non-adiabatic cases near critical layers. Then, the use of a dynamical
stellar evolution code, which treats the secular transport of angular momentum,
allows us to apply these results to the case of a solar-like star.The analysis
reveals two cases depending on the value of the Richardson number at critical
layers: a stable one, where IGWs are attenuated as they pass through a critical
level, and an unstable turbulent case where they can be reflected/transmitted
by the critical level with a coefficient larger than one. Such
over-reflection/transmission can have strong implications on our vision of
angular momentum transport in stellar interiors. This paper highlights the
existence of two regimes defining the interaction between an IGW and a critical
layer. An application exposes the effect of the first regime, showing a
strengthening of the damping of the wave. Moreover, this work opens new ways
concerning the coupling between IGWs and shear instabilities in stellar

nondeterministic one-way pushdown automata with additional oracle mechanisms,
which naturally induce various nondeterministic reducibilities among formal
languages. As a natural restriction of NP-reducibility, we introduce a notion
of many-one CFL reducibility and conduct a ground work to formulate a coherent
framework for further expositions. Two more powerful reducibilities--bounded
truth-table and Turing CFL-reducibilities--are also discussed in comparison.
The Turing CFL-reducibility, in particular, helps us introduce an exquisite
hierarchy, called the CFL hierarchy, built over the family CFL of context-free
languages. For each level of this hierarchy, its basic structural properties
are proven and three alternative characterizations are presented. The second
level is not included in NC(2) unless NP= NC(2). The first and second levels of
the hierarchy are different. The rest of the hierarchy (more strongly, the
Boolean hierarchy built over each level of the hierarchy) is also infinite
unless the polynomial hierarchy over NP collapses. This follows from a
characterization of the Boolean hierarchy over the k-th level of the polynomial
hierarchy in terms of the Boolean hierarchy over the k+1st level of the CFL
hierarchy using log-space many-one reductions. Similarly, the complexity class
Theta(k) is related to the closure of the k-th level of the CFL hierarchy under
log-space truth-table reductions. We also argue that the CFL hierarchy
coincides with a hierarchy over CFL built by application of many-one
CFL-reductions. We show that BPCFL--a bounded-error probabilistic version of
CFL--is not included in CFL even in the presence of advice. Employing a known
circuit lower bound and a switching lemma, we exhibit a relativized world where
BPCFL is not located within the second level of the CFL hierarchy.

display striking, enigmatic structures that cannot be readily explained by
examining the dynamics at the scale of single dunes, or by appealing to
patterns in external forcing. To explore the possibility that observed
structures emerge spontaneously as a collective result of many dunes
interacting with each other, we built a numerical model that treats barchans as
discrete entities that interact with one another according to simplified rules
derived from theoretical and numerical work and from field observations: (1)
Dunes exchange sand through the fluxes that leak from the downwind side of each
dune and are captured on their upstream sides; (2) when dunes become
sufficiently large, small dunes are born on their downwind sides (`calving');
and (3) when dunes collide directly enough, they merge. Results show that these
relatively simple interactions provide potential explanations for a range of
field-scale phenomena including isolated patches of dunes and heterogeneous
arrangements of similarly sized dunes in denser fields. The results also
suggest that (1) dune field characteristics depend on the sand flux fed into
the upwind boundary, although (2) moving downwind, the system approaches a
common attracting state in which the memory of the upwind conditions vanishes.
This work supports the hypothesis that calving exerts a first-order control on
field-scale phenomena; it prevents individual dunes from growing without bound,
as single-dune analyses suggest, and allows the formation of roughly realistic,
persistent dune field patterns.

and their existence can be related to the presence of different
three-dimensional arrangements. Stereoisomerism is of great importance in many
different fields since the molecular properties and biological effects of the
stereoisomers are often significantly different. Most drugs for example, are
often composed of a single stereoisomer of a compound, and while one of them
may have therapeutic effects on the body, another may be toxic. A challenging
task is the automatic detection of stereoisomers using line input
specifications such as SMILES or InChI since it requires information about
group theory (to distinguish stereoisomers using mathematical information about
its symmetry), topology and geometry of the molecule. There are several
software packages that include modules to handle stereochemistry, especially
the ones to name a chemical structure and/or view, edit and generate chemical
structure diagrams. However, there is a lack of software capable of
automatically analyzing a molecule represented as a graph and generate a
classification of the type of isomerism present in a given atom or bond.
Considering the importance of stereoisomerism when comparing chemical
structures, this report describes a computer program for analyzing and
processing steric information contained in a chemical structure represented as
a molecular graph and providing as output a binary classification of the isomer
type based on the recommended conventions. Due to the complexity of the
underlying issue, specification of stereochemical information is currently
limited to explicit stereochemistry and to the two most common types of
stereochemistry caused by asymmetry around carbon atoms: chiral atom and double
bond. A Webtool to automatically identify and classify stereochemistry is

(generalized Forster theory) proposed by Sumi [J.Phys.Chem.B,103,252(1999)] and

twofold. In the first place, by means of analytic continuation and a time
convolutionless quantum master equation approach, a theory of emission
lineshape of multichromophoric systems or molecular aggregates is proposed. In
the second place,a comprehensive framework that allows for a clear,compact and
effective study of the multichromophoric approach in the full general version

show: the effectiveness of time-convolutionless techniques in deriving

improvements in the determination of energy transfer rates in particular when
the systems under study are not the purely Forster regime. The presented scheme
allows for an effective implementation of the multichromophoric Forster
approach which may be of use for simulating energy transfer dynamics in large

polynomial differential systems which have a finite semi-elemental saddle-node
and an infinite saddle-node formed by the collision of two infinite singular
points. This family can be divided into three different subfamilies, all of
them with the finite saddle-node in the origin of the plane with the
eigenvectors on the axes and (A) with the infinite saddle-node in the
horizontal axis, (B) with the infinite saddle-node in the vertical axis and (C)
with the infinite saddle-node in the bisector of the first and third quadrants.
These three subfamilies modulo the action of the affine group and time
homotheties are three-dimensional and we give their bifurcation diagram with
respect to a normal form, in the three-dimensional real space of the parameters
of these forms. In this paper we provide the complete study of the geometry of
the first two families, (A) and (B). The bifurcation diagram for the subfamily
(A) yields 29 phase portraits for systems in QsnSN(A) counting phase portraits
with and without limit cycles, while the bifurcation diagram for the subfamily
(B) yields 16 phase portraits for systems in QsnSN(B) under the same
conditions. Case (C) will yield quite more cases and will have an independent
paper in short. Algebraic invariants are used to construct the bifurcation set.
The phase portraits are represented on the Poincar\'e disk. The bifurcation set
of QsnSN(A) is not only algebraic due to the presence of a surface found
numerically. All points in this surface correspond to connections of
separatrices.

new channels to operate trade for many businesses. Also electronic marketing
has become a proven channel of passing on the word to the customers. Legal and
ethical issues quickly become an area of concern. In this research
recommendations are made to harmonize IT and Internet Laws. A novel approach is
proposed to promote legal risk management culture in organizations. It begins
with revising current state of regulations surrounding eBusinesses and
electronic marketing. The proposed approach offers risk management by
considering risk mitigation strategy, educating people and use of information
technology. Monitoring compliance requirements are met by reviewing the latest
changes in regulations and rewarding the employees who ensures the successful
implementation of the strategy.

scenario. This network performance gets up while the clustering phenomenon has
been incorporated. The cluster formation using the vital parameters is
incredible on deciding the efficiency level of the clustered ad hoc networks.
The PSO-PAC mechanism forms clusters based on swarm intelligence by considering
energy as crucial parameter. This optimized cluster helps to suits the
applications where the energy parameter plays a key role. The clusters formed
by this mechanism may not ascertain the compactness of the clusters. Thus, this
paper proposes D-PAC as an index based validation mechanism to be handled on
clusters formed using PSO-PAC. The cluster formation and validation mechanism
have been implemented using OMNET++ simulator.

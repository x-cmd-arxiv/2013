generally contain light higgsinos with mass not too far from m_h ~125 GeV,
while other sparticles can be much heavier. In R-parity conserving models, the
lightest neutralino is then a higgsino-like WIMP (albeit with non-negligible
gaugino components), with thermal relic density well below measured values.
This leaves room for axions to function as co-dark matter particles. The local
WIMP abundance is then expected to be below standard estimates, and direct and
indirect detection rates must be accordingly rescaled. We calculate rescaled
direct and indirect higgsino-like WIMP detection rates in SUSY models that
fulfil the electroweak naturalness condition. In spite of the rescaling, we
find that ton-scale noble liquid detectors can probe the entire higgsino-like
WIMP parameter space, so that these experiments should either discover WIMPs or
exclude the concept of electroweak naturalness in R-parity conserving natural
SUSY models. Prospects for spin-dependent or indirect detection are more
limited due in part to the rescaling effect.

CO2 condensation in the middle atmosphere is inhibited and the characteristics

compute light curves and power spectra of a slender accretion torus subject to

to very different Fourier power spectra and therefore could be observationally
distinguished. Conclusions. This work is a first step in a longer-term study of

sequential measurements cannot achieve perfect compatibility between the
measurements and that therefore the notion of noncontextuality is not well
defined. We demonstrate by an explicit model that such compatibility violations
may yield a violation of noncontextuality inequalities, even if we assume that
the incompatibilities merely originate from context-independent noise. We show,
however, that this problem can be circumvented by combining the ideas behind
Leggett-Garg inequalities with those of the Kochen-Specker theorem.

physics during inflation by analyzing local features of the primordial
bispectrum. A heavy scalar field could leave large signatures in the primordial
spectra through the parametric resonance between its background oscillation and
the fluctuations. Since the duration of the heavy-mode oscillations is finite,
the effect of the resonance is localized in momentum space. In this paper, we
show that the bispectrum is amplified when such a resonance occurs, and that
the peak amplitude of the feature can be O(10^{1-2}), or as large as O(10^5)
depending on the type of interactions. In particular, the resonance can give
large contributions in finitely squeezed configurations, while the bispectrum
cannot be large in the exact squeezed limit. We also find that there is a
relation between the scales at which the features appear in the bispectrum and
the power spectrum, and that the feature in the bispectrum can be much larger
than that in the power spectrum. If correlated features are observed at
characteristic scales in the primordial spectra, it will indicate the presence
of heavy degrees of freedom. By analyzing these features, we may be able to
obtain some information on the physics behind inflation.

remnants often host planets; a complete explanation of these systems requires
an understanding of how planetary orbits evolve as their central stars lose
mass. Motivated by these dynamical systems, this paper generalizes in two
directions previous studies of orbital evolution in planetary systems with
stellar mass loss: [1] Many previous treatments focus on constant mass loss
rates and much of this work is carried out numerically. Here we study a class
of single planet systems where the stellar mass loss rate is time dependent.
The mass loss rate can be increasing or decreasing, but the stellar mass always
decreases monotonically. For this class of models, we develop analytic
approximations to specify the final orbital elements for planets that remain
bound after the epoch of mass loss, and find the conditions required for the
planets to become unbound. We also show that for some mass loss functions,
planets become unbound only in the asymptotic limit where the stellar mass
vanishes. [2] We consider the chaotic evolution for two planet systems with
stellar mass loss. Here we focus on a model consisting of analogs of Jupiter,
Saturn, and the Sun. By monitoring the divergence of initially similar
trajectories through time, we calculate the Lyapunov exponents of the system.
This analog solar system is chaotic in the absence of mass loss with Lyapunov
time in the range 5 - 10 Myr; we find that the Lyapunov time decreases with
increasing stellar mass loss rate, with a nearly linear relationship between
the two time scales. Taken together, the results of this paper help provide an
explanation for a wide range of dynamical evolution that occurs in solar
systems with stellar mass loss.

$\lambda$ is in the range $(10^{-5}-0.1)$, parameter $a$ in the range $(2.3

distinctive detection method using atomic X-rays and charged particles from the
exotic atom as well as the timing, stopping range and dE/dX energy deposit of
the incoming particle, which provides excellent antideuteron identification. In
anticipation of a future balloon experiment, an accelerator test was conducted
in 2004 and 2005 at KEK, Japan, in order to prove the concept and to precisely
measure the X-ray yields of antiprotonic exotic atoms formed with different
target materials [1]. The X-ray yields of the exotic atoms with Al and S
targets were obtained as ~ 75%, which are higher than were previously assumed
in [2]. A simple, but comprehensive cascade model has been developed not only
to evaluate the measurement results but also to predict the X-ray yields of the
exotic atoms formed with any materials in the GAPS instrument. The cascade
model is extendable to any kind of exotic atom (any negatively charged
cascading particles with any target materials), and it was compared and
validated with other experimental data and cascade models for muonic and
antiprotonic exotic atoms. The X-ray yields of the antideuteronic exotic atoms
are predicted with a simple cascade model and the sensitivity for the GAPS
antideuteron search was estimated for the proposed long duration balloon
program [3], which suggests that GAPS has a strong potential to detect
antideuterons as a dark matter signature. A GAPS prototype flight (pGAPS) was
launched successfully from the JAXA/ISAS balloon facility in Hokkaido, Japan in

planetesimals do not collide frequently enough for dynamical collisional to be
important (the collisionless limit), using a newly constructed conglomeration
code, and by carefully comparing numerical results with analytical scalings. In
the absence of collisional cooling, as large bodies grow by accreting small
bodies, the velocity dispersion of the small bodies ($u$) is increasingly
excited. Growth passes from the well-known run-away stage (when $u$ is higher
than the big bodies' hill velocity) to the newly discovered trans-hill stage
(when $u$ and big bodies both grow, but $u$ remains at the big bodies' hill
velocity). We find, concurring with the analytical understandings developed in
Lithwick (2014), as well as previous numerical studies, that a size spectrum
$dn/dR \propto R^{-4}$ results, and that the formation efficiency, defined as
mass fraction in bodies much larger than the initial size, is $\sim {\mathrm{ a
\,\, few}}\times R_\odot/a$, or $\sim 10^{-3}$ at the distance of the Kuiper
belt. We argue that this extreme inefficiency invalidates the conventional
conglomeration model for the formation of both our Kuiper belt and extra-solar
debris disks. New theories, possibly involving direct gravitational collapse,
or strong collisional cooling of small planetesimals, are required.

runaway, during which the biggest bodies grow faster than all the others. The
questions of how runaway ends and what comes next have not been answered
satisfactorily. Here we show that runaway is followed by a `trans-hill stage'
that commences once the bodies become trans-hill, i.e. once the Hill velocity
of the bodies that dominate viscous stirring matches the random speed of the
small bodies they accrete. Subsequently, the small bodies' speed grows in
lockstep with the big bodies' sizes, such that the bodies remain in the
trans-hill state. Trans-hill growth is crucial for determining the efficiency
of growing big bodies, as well as their growth timescale and size spectrum.
  We work out the properties of trans-hill growth analytically and confirm
these numerically. Trans-hill growth has two sub-stages. In the earlier one,
collisional cooling is irrelevant, in which case the efficiency of forming big
bodies remains very low (0.1% in the Kuiper belt) and their mass spectrum is
flat. This explains results from previous coagulation simulations for both the
Kuiper belt and the asteroid belt. The second sub-stage commences when small
bodies begin to collide with one another. Collisional cooling then controls the
evolution, in which case the efficiency of forming big bodies rises, and their
size spectrum becomes more top-heavy.
  Trans-hill growth terminates in one of two ways, depending on parameters.
First, mutual accretion of big bodies can become significant and conglomeration
proceeds until half the total mass is converted into big bodies. This mode of
growth may explain the size distributions of minor bodies in the Solar System,
and is explored in forthcoming work. Second, if big bodies become separated by
their Hill radius, oligarchy commences. This mode likely precedes the formation
of fully-fledged planets.

behavior in the distribution of importance among the nodes, as compared to the

published radio and visible light observations to put six independent

the bolometric luminosity of the outburst detected prior to the explosion.

effective mass-loss rate from the progenitor was between 10^-3 to 10^-2 solar
masses per year, over a few years prior to the explosion, with a velocity of
~1000 km/s. This mass-loss rate corresponds to a total circum stellar matter
mass of ~0.04 solar masses, within 6x10^15 cm of the SN. We note that the
mass-loss rate estimate based on the H alpha luminosity is higher by an order
of magnitude. This can be explained if the narrow line H alpha component is
generated at radii larger than the shock radius, or if the CSM has an
aspherical geometry. We discuss simple geometries which are consistent with our

at the level of field equations. The review starts with a brief account of the

of the tetrad fields as reference frames adapted to arbitrary observers in

obtained. It is shown that the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian field equations allow
to define the energy, momentum and angular momentum of the gravitational field,

machines, like myosin. We have demonstrated that unfolding of a fractal globule
can be described as a cascade of equilibrium phase transitions in a
hierarchical system. Unfolding manifests itself in a sequential loss of
stability of hierarchical levels with the temperature change.

contraction of planets close to their parent star, under the influence of
evaporation. The mass-loss rates are based on hydrodynamic models of
evaporation that include both X-ray and EUV irradiation. We find that only
low-mass planets with hydrogen envelopes are significantly affected by
evaporation, with evaporation being able to remove massive hydrogen envelopes
inward of 0.1 AU for Neptune-mass objects.
  We construct a theoretical population of planets with varying core masses,
envelope masses, orbital separations, and stellar spectral types, and compare
these against the sizes and densities measured for low-mass planets, both in
the Kepler mission and from radial velocity surveys. This exercise leads us to
conclude that evaporation is the driving force of evolution for close-in Kepler
planets. In fact, some 50% of the Kepler planet candidates may have been
significantly eroded. Evaporation explains two striking correlations observed
in these objects: a lack of large radius/low density planets close to the
stars, and a bimodal distribution in planet sizes with a deficit of planets
around 2R_E. Planets that have experienced high X-ray exposures are generally
smaller than this size, and those with lower X-ray exposures are typically
larger. A bimodal distribution is naturally explained by the evaporation model,
where, depending on their X-ray exposure, close-in planets can either hold on
to hydrogen envelopes 1% in mass, or be stripped entirely.
  To quantitatively reproduce the observed features, we argue that not only do
low-mass Kepler planets need to be made of rocky cores overlaid with hydrogen
envelopes, but few of them should have initial masses above 20 M_E, and the
majority of them should have core masses of a few Earth masses.

problems, which contain two levels of optimization tasks. In these problems,
the optimal solutions to the lower level problem become possible feasible

Despite the efforts, there hardly exists any effective methodology, which is

approach is capable of handling bilevel problems with different kinds of
complexities in relatively smaller number of function evaluations. Ideas from
classical optimization have been hybridized with evolutionary methods to
generate an efficient optimization algorithm for generic bilevel problems. The
efficacy of the algorithm has been shown on two sets of test problems. The
first set is a recently proposed SMD test set, which contains problems with
controllable complexities, and the second set contains standard test problems
collected from the literature. The proposed method has been evaluated against
two benchmarks, and the performance gain is observed to be significant.

communication but also to Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) technology that
supports supply chain management. The challenge of Multi-user Detection (MUD)
is that of demodulating mutually interfering signals, and the two biggest
impediments are the asynchronous character of random access and the lack of
channel state information. Given that at any time instant the number of active
users is typically small, the promise of Compressive Sensing (CS) is the
demodulation of sparse superpositions of signature waveforms from very few
measurements. This paper begins by unifying two front-end architectures
proposed for MUD by showing that both lead to the same discrete signal model.
Algorithms are presented for coherent and noncoherent detection that are based
on iterative matching pursuit. Noncoherent detection is all that is needed in
the application to RFID technology where it is only the identity of the active
users that is required. The coherent detector is also able to recover the
transmitted symbols. It is shown that compressive demodulation requires
$\mathcal{O}(K\log N(\tau+1))$ samples to recover $K$ active users whereas
standard MUD requires $N(\tau+1)$ samples to process $N$ total users with a
maximal delay $\tau$. Performance guarantees are derived for both coherent and
noncoherent detection that are identical in the way they scale with number of
active users. The power profile of the active users is shown to be less
important than the SNR of the weakest user. Gabor frames and Kerdock codes are
proposed as signature waveforms and numerical examples demonstrate the superior
performance of Kerdock codes - the same probability of error with less than
half the samples.

the disk atmosphere is dominated by Na, Zn, and O2 at lower temperatures (<

chemistry is consistent for any silicate melt composition, and we thus expect
abundant SiO, O2, and O to be a common feature of hot, impact-generated debris

oxygen fugacity (fO2) values (and hence H2O/H2 and CO2/CO ratios) several
orders of magnitude higher than those in a solar-composition gas. High fO2
values in the disk atmosphere are found for any silicate composition because
oxygen is the most abundant element in rock. We thus expect high oxygen

~10 Myr, with an average star formation rate (SFR) as high as ~1 M_sun/yr (or
~2 x 10^{-5} M_sun yr^{-1} pc^{-2}). On the other hand, the secondary body was
much less active at these epochs, in agreement with the absence of significant
nebular emission. The high current SFR can explain the very blue colors and the
high ionized gas content in IZw18, resembling primeval galaxies in the early

understand the role played by intermediate mass stars in the self-enrichment

galaxies from $ z = 0.60$ to the present. Fitting the luminosity function to a
standard Schechter form, we find a rapid evolution of $M_B^*$ consistent with
that found in other deep surveys; at the present epoch $M_B^*$ is evolving at
the rate of $0.38 Gyr^{-1}$, several times faster than the predictions of
simple models for the evolution of old, coeval galaxies. The evolution of the
distribution of specific star formation rates (SSFR) is also too rapid to
explain by such models. We demonstrate that starbursts cannot, even in
principle, explain the evolution of the SSFR distribution. However, the rapid
evolution of both $M_B^*$ and the SSFR distribution can be explained if some
fraction of galaxies have star formation rates characterized by both short rise
and fall times and by an epoch of peak star formation more recent than the
majority of galaxies. Although galaxies of every stellar mass up to
$1.4\times10^{11}\Msun$ show a range of epochs of peak star formation, the
fraction of ""younger"" galaxies falls from about 40% at a mass of
$4\times10^{10}\Msun$ to zero at a mass of $1.4\times10^{11}\Msun$. The
incidence of younger galaxies appears to be insensitive to the density of the

well as fitting, in ensemble, the cosmic star formation rate density from z=0
to z=8. This model predicts, with striking fidelity, the distribution of
specific star formation rates in mass-limited galaxy samples to z=1; this match
is not achieved by other models with a different functional form for the star
formation histories of individual galaxies, but with the same number of degrees
of freedom, suggesting that the log-normal form is well matched to the likely
actual histories of individual galaxies. We also impose the specific star
formation rate versus mass distributions at higher redshifts from Paper III as
constraints on the model, and show that, as previously suggested, some galaxies
in the field, particularly low mass galaxies, are quite young at intermediate
redshifts. As emphasized in Paper III, starbursts are insufficient

  Stochastic Processes","22 pages, 3 figures, accepted to Journal of Mathematical Physics",,"10.1063/1.4795351",,"math-ph astro-ph.CO math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hill's equations arise in a wide variety of physical problems, and are
specified by a natural frequency, a periodic forcing function, and a forcing
strength parameter. This classic problem is generalized here in two ways: [A]
to Random Hill's equations which allow the forcing strength q_k, the
oscillation frequency \lambda_k, and the period \tau_k of the forcing function
to vary from cycle to cycle, and [B] to Stochastic Hill's equations which
contain (at least) one additional term that is a stochastic process \xi. This
paper considers both random and stochastic Hill's equations with small
parameter variations, so that p_k=q_k-<q_k>, \ell_k=\lambda_k-<\lambda_k>, and
\xi are all O(\epsilon), where \epsilon<<1. We show that random Hill's
equations and stochastic Hill's equations have the same growth rates when the
parameter variations p_k and \ell_k obey certain constraints given in terms of
the moments of \xi. For random Hill's equations, the growth rates for the
solutions are given by the growth rates of a matrix transformation, under
matrix multiplication, where the matrix elements vary from cycle to cycle.
Unlike classic Hill's equations where the parameter space (the \lambda-q plane)
displays bands of stable solutions interlaced with bands of unstable solutions,
random Hill's equations are generically unstable. We find analytic
approximations for the growth rates of the instability; for the regime where
Hill's equation is classically stable, and the parameter variations are small,
the growth rate \gamma = O(\epsilon^2). Using the relationship between the
(\ell_k,p_k) and the \xi, this result for \gamma can be used to find growth
rates for stochastic Hill's equations.

small populations, but it is largely unknown how its effect depends on the life
histories of species. We modeled effects of demographic stochasticity on
extinction risk in a broad range of generalized life histories, using matrix
models and branching processes. Extinction risks of life histories varied
greatly in their sensitivity to demographic stochasticity. Comparing life
histories, extinction risk generally increased with increasing fecundity and
decreased with higher ages of maturation. Effects of adult survival depended on
age of maturation. At lower ages of maturation, extinction risk peaked at
intermediate levels of adult survival, but it increased along with adult
survival at higher ages of maturation. These differences were largely explained
by differences in sensitivities of population growth to perturbations of
life-history traits. Juvenile survival rate contributed most to total
demographic variance in the majority of life histories. Our general results
confirmed earlier findings, suggesting that empirical patterns can be explained
by a relatively simple model. Thus, basic life history information can be used
to assign life-history-specific sensitivity to demographic stochasticity. This
is of great value when assessing the vulnerability of small populations.

Here it is argued that the problem occurs only for one-dimensional infinite

limit is taken at the end. In one dimension the expansion is sensitive to
boundary conditions because of the severe infrared behavior, but this is not

filtering of the set of all possible double contingencies. It is certified to
identify all the dangerous contingencies, and has the complexity comparable to
the N-1 contingency screening. Tests performed on realistic model of Polish
power grid with about 3000 buses show that only two iterations of algorithm
allow one to certify the safety of 99.9% of all double contingencies, leaving
only 0.1% of the most dangerous ones for direct analysis.

  medium","33 pages",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a stochastic individual model for the spatial behavior of an
animal population of dispersive and competitive species, considering various
kinds of biological effects, such as heterogeneity of environmental conditions,
mutual attractive or repulsive interactions between individuals or competition
between them for resources. As a consequence of the study of the large
population limit, global existence of a nonnegative weak solution to a
multidimensional parabolic strongly coupled model of competing species is
proved. The main new feature of the corresponding integro-differential equation
is the nonlocal nonlinearity appearing in the diffusion terms, which may depend
on the spatial densities of all population types. Moreover, the diffusion
matrix is generally not strictly positive definite and the cross-diffusion
effect allows for linearly growing influences of the subpopulations' sizes. We
prove uniqueness of the finite measure-valued solution and give conditions
under which the solution takes values in a functional space. We then make the
competition kernels converge to a Dirac measure and obtain the existence of a
solution to a locally competitive version of the previous equation. The large
population limit is obtained by means of weak convergence tools for measure
valued processes. The techniques employed in the study of the liming equation
are novel, and are essentially based on the underlying stochastic flow related
to the dispersive part of the dynamics, together with the use of suitable dual
distances in the space of finite measures. This is an extended version of the

facilitate constructive designs of sensing matrices based on coding-theoretic
techniques; (c) enable one to solve the exact $\ell_0$-minimization problem in

sufficient conditions for when the relaxation matches the original problem; and

small grain production in galaxies. We examine the robustness or uncertainty in
the theoretical predictions of shattering. We identify $P_1$ (the critical
pressure above which the deformation destroys the original lattice structures)
as the most important quantity in determining the timescale of small grain
production, and confirm that the same $P_1/t$ ($t$ is the duration of
shattering) gives the same grain size distribution [$n(a)$, where $a$ is the
grain radius] after shattering within a factor of 3. The uncertainty in the
fraction of shocked material that is eventually ejected as fragments causes
uncertainties in $n(a)$ by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6 for silicate and
carbonaceous dust, respectively. The size distribution of shattered fragments
have minor effects as long as the power index of the fragment size distribution
is less than ~ 3.5, since the slope of grain size distribution $n(a)$
continuously change by shattering and becomes consistent with $n(a)\propto
a^{-3.5}$. The grain velocities as a function of grain radius can have an
imprint in the grain size distribution especially for carbonaceous dust. We
also show that the formulation of shattering can be simplified without losing
sufficient precision.

the sole source of spectrum information for White Space Devices (WSDs).
Geo-location databases protect TV band incumbents by keeping track of TV
transmitters and their protected service areas based on their location,
transmission parameters and sophisticated propagation models. In this article,
we argue that keeping track of both TV transmitters and TV receivers (i.e. TV
sets) can achieve significant improvement in the availability of white spaces.
We first identify wasted spectrum opportunities, both temporal and spatial, due
to the current approach of white spaces detection. We then propose DynaWhite, a
cloud-based architecture that orchestrates the detection and dissemination of
highly-dynamic, real-time, and fine-grained TV white space information.
DynaWhite introduces the next generation of geo-location databases by combining
traditional sensing techniques with a novel unconventional sensing approach
based on the detection of the passive TV receivers using standard cell phones.
We present a quantitative evaluation of the potential gains in white space
availability for large scale deployments of DynaWhite. We finally identify
challenges that need to be addressed in the research community in order to
exploit this potential for leveraging dynamic real-time fine-grained TV white
spaces.

the QCD quark condensate. Two competing mechanisms are identified, both relying
on the interaction between the magnetic field and the low quark modes. While
the coupling to valence quarks enhances the condensate, the interaction with
sea quarks suppresses it in the transition region. The latter `sea effect' acts
by ordering the Polyakov loop and, thereby, reduces the number of small Dirac
eigenmodes and the condensate. It is most effective around the transition
temperature, where the Polyakov loop effective potential is flat and a small
correction to it by the magnetic field can have a significant effect. Around
the critical temperature, the sea suppression overwhelms the valence
enhancement, resulting in a net suppression of the condensate, named inverse
magnetic catalysis. We support this physical picture by lattice simulations
including continuum extrapolated results on the Polyakov loop as a function of
temperature and magnetic field. We argue that taking into account the increase
in the Polyakov loop and its interaction with the low-lying modes is essential
to obtain the full physical picture, and should be incorporated in effective
models for the description of QCD in magnetic fields in the transition region.

violating the well-known Bell and CHSH inequalities or another simple

because of its equivalence to a novel noncontextual inequality by Klyachko et

need not hold any more in more general probabilistic theories (super quantum
probabilities). Wright, Popescu and Rohrlich identified states which are
included in such theories, but impossible in quantum mechanics, and they showed
this using its Hilbert space formalism. Recently, Fritz et al. and Cabello
detected that the impossibility of these states can be derived from very
general principles (local orthogonality and global exclusive disjunction,
respectively) without using Hilbert space techniques. In the paper, an
alternative derivation from rather different phyisical principles will be
presented. These are a reasonable calculus of conditional probability (i.e., a

of $l_1$ vector norm, the mixed $l_{2,1}$ matrix norm is often used to find
jointly sparse solutions. Moreover, an efficient iterative algorithm has been
designed to solve $l_{2,1}$-norm involved minimizations. Actually,
computational studies have showed that $l_p$-regularization ($0<p<1$) is
sparser than $l_1$-regularization, but the extension to matrix norm has been
seldom considered. This paper presents a definition of mixed $l_{2,p}$ $(p\in
(0, 1])$ matrix pseudo norm which is thought as both generalizations of $l_p$
vector norm to matrix and $l_{2,1}$-norm to nonconvex cases $(0<p<1)$.
Fortunately, an efficient unified algorithm is proposed to solve the induced
$l_{2,p}$-norm $(p\in (0, 1])$ optimization problems. The convergence can also
be uniformly demonstrated for all $p\in (0, 1]$. Typical $p\in (0,1]$ are
applied to select features in computational biology and the experimental

The domain $\big\{(C_\sigma,w_\sigma) \big\}_\sigma$ is signed since the net
number of its intersections with any $E_+$-orbit is 1, i. e. for any $x\in
\mathbb{R}^n_+$, $$ \sum_{\sigma\in S_{n-1}} \sum_{\varepsilon\in E_+}
w_\sigma\chi^{\phantom{1}}_{C_\sigma}(\varepsilon x) = 1. $$ Here
$\chi_{C_\sigma}$ is the characteristic function of $C_\sigma$, $w_\sigma=\pm1$
is a natural orientation of the $n$-dimensional $k$-rational cone
$C_\sigma\subset\mathbb{R}^n_+$, and the inner sum is actually finite. Signed
fundamental domains are as useful as Shintani's true ones for the purpose of
calculating abelian $L$-functions. They have the advantage of being easily
constructed from any set of fundamental units, whereas in practice there is no
algorithm producing Shintani's $k$-rational cones. Our proof uses algebraic
topology on the quotient manifold $\mathbb{R}^n_+/E_+$. The invariance of the
topological degree under homotopy allows us to control the deformation of a
crooked fundamental domain into nice straight cones. Crossings may occur during
the homotopy, leading to the need to subtract some cones.

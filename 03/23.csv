of neutrons in the outer crust of neutron stars are systematically investigated
with respect to their neutron pairing properties. This is done using Skyrme
density-functional and different pairing forces such as a density-dependent
contact interaction and a separable form of a finite-range Gogny interaction.
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov and BCS theories are compared. It is found that neutron
pairing is reduced towards the drip line while overcast by strong shell
effects. Furthermore resonances in the continuum can have an important effect
counterbalancing the tendency of reduction and leading to a persistence of
pairing at the drip line. It is also shown that in these systems the difference
between HFB and BCS approaches can be qualitatively large.

consequence, the detection of correlation functions between an arbitrary set of
lattice sites is possible. This enables not only the detection of two-site
correlation functions but also the evaluation of non-local correlations, which
originate from an extended region of the system and are used for the
characterization of quantum phases that do not possess (quasi-)long-range order

Most of the work dealing with this subject has focused on the reconstruction of
the signal's representation as the means for recovering the signal itself. This
approach forced the dictionary to be of low coherence and with no linear
dependencies between its columns. Recently, a series of contributions that
focus on signal recovery using the analysis model find that linear dependencies
in the analysis dictionary are in fact permitted and beneficial. In this paper
we show theoretically that the same holds also for signal recovery in the

searches for a state of hidden variables $x$ that maximizes $p(x,y \mid

introduce VT to PRISM, a logic-based probabilistic modeling system for
generative models. VT improves PRISM in three ways. First VT in PRISM converges
faster than EM in PRISM due to the VT's termination condition. Second,
parameters learned by VT often show good prediction performance compared to
those learned by EM. We conducted two parsing experiments with probabilistic
grammars while learning parameters by a variety of inference methods, i.e.\ VT,
EM, MAP and VB. The result is that VT achieved the best parsing accuracy among
them in both experiments. Also we conducted a similar experiment for
classification tasks where a hidden variable is not a prediction target unlike
probabilistic grammars. We found that in such a case VT does not necessarily
yield superior performance. Third since VT always deals with a single
probability of a single explanation, Viterbi explanation, the exclusiveness
condition that is imposed on PRISM programs is no more required if we learn
parameters by VT.
  Last but not least we can say that as VT in PRISM is general and applicable
to any PRISM program, it largely reduces the need for the user to develop a
specific VT algorithm for a specific model. Furthermore since VT in PRISM can
be used just by setting a PRISM flag appropriately, it makes VT easily
accessible to (probabilistic) logic programmers. To appear in Theory and

Therefore, GAEL can avoid the problems that are brought by traditional

kilometers through free-space optical (FSO) links and depending on the link
design, the electrical estimates of the FSO system can be directly used or
distributed to end-user through radio-frequency (RF) links over short ranges.
However, inhomogeneities on the FSO transmission path cause random fluctuations
in the received signal intensity and these effects induced by atmospheric
turbulence closely effect the system performance. Several distinct probability
distributions based on experimental measurements are used to characterize FSO
channels and using these probabilistic models, detection error probability
analysis of the proposed system for different link designs are carried out
under weak, moderate and strong turbulence conditions. The results of the
analysis show that depending on the atmospheric conditions, system performance
of the composite link can have high error floors due to the false estimates of
FSO link. The system performance can be improved by employing error control
coding techniques. One simple solution employing a convolutional encoder and
Viterbi decoder pair is also analyzed in this thesis. Another important system
parameter that is the average channel capacity of the FSO system is analyzed
under weak and moderate turbulence conditions. Theoretical derivations that are

what I will call the `Newtonian Paradigm' in all of physics, including Newton,
Einstein, and Schrodinger. As I will show shortly, Newton invented and
bequeathed to us `efficient cause entailing laws' for the entire becoming of
the universe. With Laplace this became the foundation of contemporary
reductionism in which all that can happen in the world is due to efficient
cause entailing laws. More this framework stands as our dominant way to do
science. The Newtonian Paradigm has done enormous work in science, and helped
lead to the Industrial Revolution, and even our entry into Modernity.
  In this paper I propose to challenge the adequacy of the Newtonian Paradigm
on two ground: 1) For the evolution of the biosphere beyond the watershed of
life, we can formulate no efficient cause entailing laws that allow us to
deduce the evolution of the biosphere. A fortiori, the same holds for the
evolution of the economy, legal systems, social systems, and culture. Because I
have discussed this before with my colleagues Longo and Montevil (1,2) and
elsewhere, (3,4), my discussion of this first point will be rather brief. 2)
What I shall choose to call, after Aristotle's four causes, noted below, Formal
Cause Laws derived from specific `ensemble theories' tell us about the world.
But Formal Cause Laws are not reducible to efficient cause entailing laws of
the Newtonian Paradigm and, critically, have already, unnoticed, crept into
biology concerning the origin of life, and economics concerning economic
growth. Formal cause laws appear to be a new way to do science, independent of
efficient cause entailing laws. Thus Formal Cause laws can be independent of
any specific material substrate. This may bear on the sufficiency of
Materialism in our account of the world.

especially when only a subset of the questions are answered. The key
observation that enables a well-posed solution is the fact that typical
educational domains of interest involve only a small number of key concepts.
Leveraging this observation, we develop both a bi-convex maximum-likelihood and
a Bayesian solution to the resulting SPARse Factor Analysis (SPARFA) problem.
We also incorporate user-defined tags on questions to facilitate the
interpretability of the estimated factors. Experiments with synthetic and

dynamical property emerging from their interaction with the Higgs field. We
show that this assumption implies peculiar deviations from the law of universal
gravitation in its distance and mass dependence, as well as from the
superposition principle. The experimental observation of the predicted
deviations from the law of universal gravitation seems out of reach. However,
we argue that a new class of experiments aimed at studying the influence of
surrounding masses on the gravitational force - similar to the ones performed
by Quirino Majorana almost a century ago - could be performed to test the
superposition principle and to give direct limits on the presence of
non-minimal couplings between the Higgs field and the spacetime curvature. From
the conceptual viewpoint, the violation of the superposition principle for
gravitational forces due to the Higgs field creates a conflict with the notion
that gravitational potentials, as assumed in Newtonian gravitation or in
post-Newtonian parameterizations of metric theories, are well-defined concepts
to describe gravity in their non-relativistic limit.

them have only recently been studied starting with the 1983 seminal work of
Fong and Radjavi and continuing with two recent articles by the authors of this
survey. This article surveys this study embodied in these three articles. A
subideal is a two-sided ideal of J (for specificity also called a J-ideal) for
J an arbitrary ideal of B(H). In this terminology we alternatively call J a
B(H)-ideal.
  This surveys these three articles in which we developed a complete
characterization of all J-ideals generated by sets of cardinality strictly less
than the cardinality of the continuum. So a central theme is the impact of
generating sets for subideals on their algebraic structure. This
characterization includes in particular finitely and countably generated
J-ideals. It was obtained by first generalizing to arbitrary principal J-ideals
the 1983 work of Fong-Radjavi who determined which principal K(H)-ideals are
also B(H)-ideals. A key property in our investigation turned out to be
J-softness of a B(H)-ideal I inside J, that is, IJ = I, a generalization of a
recent notion of K(H)-softness of B(H)-ideals introduced by Kaftal-Weiss and
earlier exploited for Banach spaces by Mityagin and Pietsch. This study of
subideals and the study of elementary operators with coefficient constraints
are closely related. Here we also introduce and study a notion of
subideal-traces where classical traces (unitarily invariant linear functionals)
need not make sense for subideals that are not B(H)-ideals.

systems. The next-generation of SCBSs is envisioned to be multi-mode, i.e.,
capable of transmitting simultaneously on both licensed and unlicensed bands.
This constitutes a cost-effective integration of both WiFi and cellular radio
access technologies (RATs) that can efficiently cope with peak wireless data
traffic and heterogeneous quality-of-service requirements. To leverage the
advantage of such multi-mode SCBSs, we discuss the novel proposed paradigm of
cross-system learning by means of which SCBSs self-organize and autonomously
steer their traffic flows across different RATs. Cross-system learning allows
the SCBSs to leverage the advantage of both the WiFi and cellular worlds. For
example, the SCBSs can offload delay-tolerant data traffic to WiFi, while
simultaneously learning the probability distribution function of their
transmission strategy over the licensed cellular band. This article will first
introduce the basic building blocks of cross-system learning and then provide
preliminary performance evaluation in a Long-Term Evolution (LTE) simulator
overlaid with WiFi hotspots. Remarkably, it is shown that the proposed

correspond to different incarnations of the RS model, in which the Higgs field
is either localized on the IR brane or is described in terms of a narrow bulk

effects of higher-dimensional operators contributing to the gg->h amplitude at

galaxy clusters and among some of the unassociated point sources of the 2 years
Fermi catalogue. Such a combination of signals could be generated by dark
matter annihilations in the main dark matter halo, its substructures and nearby
galaxy clusters. We discuss in this work the consistency between the number of
events observed at the line energies in the sky and the predictions using
results from the Via Lactea II numerical simulation and extrapolations below
its mass resolution, taking into account that the annihilation cross-section to
the lines can be estimated from the Galactic center signal. We find that some
extrapolations to small substructures can naturally account for the point
sources signal, although the hypothesis of background only cannot be rejected.
We also study the morphology of the gamma-ray sky at the 2 lines energies,
testing different Galactic diffuse background models to account for
interstellar medium uncertainties, and different assumptions on the DM diffuse
component profile. We find from template fits that within reasonable diffuse
background uncertainties the presence of a spherical halo component is
preferred with cuspier dark matter halo profiles being preferable even from the
full sky fit. We finally check the impact of a dark disk component, suggested
by cosmological simulations that include baryons and find that thin dark disks
can not be disfavored, thus possibly accounting for the preferentially closer
to the Galactic disk distribution of the point sources lines signal.

a number of distinct final states which necessitate different search strategies
in the collider experiments. In this paper we, on the other hand, propose a
general search strategy to look for third generation squarks in the final state
which contains a top quark in the sample along with two additional hard leptons
and substantial missing transverse momentum. We illustrate that a search
strategy using the dileptonic $M_{T2}$, the effective mass $m_{eff}$ and jet
substructure to reconstruct the hadronic top quark can be very effective to
reduce the SM backgrounds. With the proposed search strategy, we estimate that
the third generation squarks with masses up to about 800 GeV can be probed at
the 14 TeV LHC with a 100 $fb^{-1}$ data set. We also interpret our results in
two simplified scenarios where we consider the stop (sbottom) pair production
followed by their subsequent decay to a top quark and the second lightest
neutralino (lightest chargino). In this case also we find that stop (sbottom)
mass up to 1 TeV (0.9 TeV) can be discovered at the 14 TeV LHC with 100

in extreme nonlinear optics in the mid-infrared wavelength region. As the
wavelength of light \lambda=2\pi/k increases with respect to the transverse
size R of a leaky waveguide, the loss of light out of the waveguide upon
propagation, in general, increases. The now standard numerical approach for
studying such structures is based on expansion of the propagating field into
approximate leaky waveguide modes. We compare this approach to a new method
that resolves the electric field in real space and correctly captures the
energy loss through the waveguide wall. The comparison reveals that the
expansion-based approach overestimates losses that occur in nonlinearly
reshaped pulsed waveforms. For a modest increase in computational effort, the
new method offers a physically more accurate model to describe phenomena (e.g.,
extreme pulse-selfcompression) in waveguides with smaller values of kR.

gravitational wave (GW) signals. The ejection of r-process material from such
mergers may lead to a radioactively-powered electromagnetic counterpart which,
if discovered, would enhance the science return of a GW detection. As very
little is known about the optical properties of heavy r-process elements,
previous light curve models have adopted opacities similar to those of iron
group elements. Here we report that the presence of heavier elements,
particularly the lanthanides, increase the ejecta opacity by several orders of
magnitude. We include these higher opacities in time dependent,
multi-wavelength radiative transport calculations to predict the broadband
light curves of one-dimensional models over a range of parameters (ejecta
masses from 0.001 to 0.1 solar masses and velocities from 0.1 to 0.3c). We find
that the higher opacities lead to much longer duration light curves which can
last a week or more. The emission is shifted toward the infrared bands due to
strong optical line blanketing, and the colors at later times are
representative of a blackbody near the recombination temperature of the
lanthanides (T ~ 2500K). We further consider the case in which a second mass
outflow, composed of 56Ni, is ejected from a disk wind, and show that the net
result is a distinctive two component spectral energy distribution, with a
bright optical peak due to 56Ni and an infrared peak due to r-process ejecta.

is an important goal of future transient surveys, offering new perspectives on
the origin of r-process nuclei and the astrophysical sources of gravitational
waves. Predictions of the transient light curves and spectra, however, have
suffered from the uncertain optical properties of heavy ions. Here we consider
the opacity of expanding r-process material and argue that it is dominated by
line transitions from those ions with the most complex valence electron
structure, namely the lanthanides. For a few representative ions, we run atomic
structure models to calculate radiative data for tens of millions of lines. We
find that the resulting r-process opacities are orders of magnitude larger than
that of ordinary (e.g., iron-rich) supernova ejecta. Radiative transport
calculations using these new opacities indicate that the transient emission
should be dimmer and redder than previously thought. The spectra appear
pseudo-blackbody, with broad absorption features, and peak in the infrared (~1
micron). We discuss uncertainties in the opacities and attempt to quantify
their impact on the spectral predictions. The results have important

not necessarily positive or negative definite, applicable, in particular, to
the eigenvalue problem underlying the Camassa-Holm hierarchy. In fact, we will
treat a more general version where $A$ represents a positive definite
Schr\""odinger or Sturm-Liouville operator $T$ in $L^2(\bbR; dx)$ associated
with a differential expression of the form $\tau = - (d/dx) p(x) (d/dx) +
q(x)$, $x \in \bbR$, and $B$ represents an operator of multiplication by $r(x)$
in $L^2(\bbR; dx)$, which, in general, is not a weight, that is, it is not
nonnegative a.e.\ on $\bbR$. Our methods naturally permit us to treat certain
classes of distributions (resp., measures) for the coefficients $q$ and $r$ and
hence considerably extend the scope of this (generalized) eigenvalue problem,
without having to change the underlying Hilbert space $L^2(\bbR; dx)$. Our
approach relies on rewriting the eigenvalue problem $A \psi = \lambda B \psi$
in the form $A^{-1/2} B A^{-1/2} \chi = \lambda^{-1} \chi$, $\chi = A^{1/2}
\psi$, and a careful study of (appropriate realizations of) the operator
$A^{-1/2} B A^{-1/2}$ in $L^2(\bbR; dx)$.
  In the course of our treatment we employ a supersymmetric formalism which
permits us to factor the second-order operator $T$ into a product of two
first-order operators familiar from (and inspired by) Miura's transformation
linking the KdV and mKdV hierarchy of nonlinear evolution equations. We also
treat the case of periodic coefficients $q$ and $r$, where $q$ may be a
distribution and $r$ generates a measure and hence no smoothness is assumed for
$q$ and $r$.

oscillations of controls, such as an infinite number of switchings over a
compact interval of times. In this paper we focus on three typical occurences
of chattering: the Fuller phenomenon, referring to situations where an optimal
control switches an infinite number of times over a compact set; the Robbins
phenomenon, concerning optimal control problems with state constraints, meaning
that the optimal trajectory touches the boundary of the constraint set an
infinite number of times over a compact time interval; the Zeno phenomenon,
referring as well to an infinite number of switchings over a compact set, for
hybrid optimal control problems. From the practical point of view, when trying
to compute an optimal trajectory, for instance by means of a shooting method,
chattering may be a serious obstacle to convergence.
  In this paper we propose a general regularization procedure, by adding an
appropriate penalization of the total variation. This produces a quasi-optimal
control, and we prove that the family of quasi-optimal solutions converges to
the optimal solution of the initial problem as the penalization tends to zero.
Under additional assumptions, we also quantify the quasi-optimality property by
determining a speed of convergence of the costs.

moving through a planar dipole undulator, excited by a fixed planar polarized
plane wave Maxwell field in the X-Ray Free Electron Laser (FEL) regime. Our
starting point is the 6D Lorentz system, which allows planar motions, and we
examine this dynamical system as the wavelength of the traveling wave varies.
By scalings and transformations the 6D system is reduced, without
approximation, to a 2D system in a form for a rigorous asymptotic analysis
using the Method of Averaging (MoA), a long time perturbation theory. The two
dependent variables are a scaled energy deviation and a generalization of the
so-called ponderomotive phase. As the wavelength varies the system passes
through resonant and nonresonant (NR) zones and we develop NR and
near-to-resonant (NtoR) normal form approximations. For a special initial
condition and on resonance, the NtoR normal form reduces to the well-known FEL
pendulum system. We then state and prove NR and NtoR first-order averaging
theorems which give near optimal error bounds for the MoA approximations. The
proofs are novel in that they do not use a near identity transformation and
they use a system of differential inequalities. The NR case is an example of
quasiperiodic averaging where the small divisor problem enters in the simplest
possible way. To our knowledge the planar problem has not been analyzed with
the generality we aspire to here nor has the standard FEL pendulum system been
derived with associated error bounds as we do here.

show that the isotropy condition, together with three other conditions on the
Jacobi endomorphism, characterize sprays that are metrizable by Finsler
functions of scalar flag curvature. The proof of Theorem 3.1 provides an
algorithm to construct the Finsler function of scalar flag curvature, in the

the regularity of the sought after Finsler function, can be relaxed. By
relaxing this condition, we provide examples of sprays that are metrizable by
conic pseudo-Finsler functions as well as degenerate Finsler functions.
  Hilbert's fourth problem asks to determine the Finsler functions with

fourth problem is necessarily of constant or scalar flag curvature. Therefore,

sensor networks (WSNs) operations because of the limited and non-replenish able
energy supply. Data aggregation mechanism is one of the possible solutions to
prolong the life time of sensor nodes and on the other hand it also helps in
eliminating the data redundancy and improving the accuracy of information
gathering, is essential for WSNs. In this paper we propose a Clustering based
lifetime maximizing aggregation tree (CLMAT) in which we create aggregation
tree which aim to reduce energy consumption, minimizing the distance traversed
and minimizing the cost in terms of energy consumption. In CLMAT the node
having maximum available energy is used as parent node/ aggregator node. We
concluded with the best possible aggregation tree minimizing energy
utilization, minimizing cost and hence maximizing network lifetime.

Hamiltonian system and regular reduced Hamiltonian systems are given. At first,
an important lemma is proved, and it is a modification for the corresponding
result of Abraham and Marsden in [1], such that we can prove two types of
geometric Hamilton-Jacobi theorem for a Hamiltonian system on the cotangent
bundle of a configuration manifold, by using the symplectic structure and
dynamical vector field. Then these results are generalized to the regular
reducible Hamiltonian system with symmetry and momentum map, by using the
reduced symplectic structure and the reduced dynamical vector field. The
Hamilton-Jacobi theorems are proved and two types of Hamilton-Jacobi equations,
for the regular point reduced Hamiltonian system and the regular orbit reduced
Hamiltonian system, are obtained. As an application of the theoretical results,
the regular point reducible Hamiltonian system on a Lie group is considered,
and two types of Lie-Poisson Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the regular point
reduced system are given. In particular, the Type I and Type II of Lie-Poisson
Hamilton-Jacobi equations for the regular point reduced rigid body and heavy
top systems are shown, respectively.

The proposed observer is proven to be robust in the presence of perturbations

partially observable in the sense of observability rank condition. Due to its
switching behavior, a recent concept of $Z(T_N)$ observability is used to
analysis its hybrid observability, since its observability depends upon the
switching control signals. Under certain condition of the switching sequences,
the voltage across each capacitor becomes observable. Simulation results and
comparisons with Luenberger switched observer highlight the effectiveness and
robustness of the proposed observer with respect to output measurement noise

in the approximation of the stochastic kinetics of chemical reaction systems.
In this paper we derive a general moment expansion method for any type of
propensities and which allows expansion up to any number of moments. For some
chemical reaction systems, more than two moments are necessary to describe the
dynamic properties of the system, which the linear noise approximation (LNA) is
unable to provide. Moreover, also for systems for which the mean does not have
a strong dependence on higher order moments, moment approximation methods give
information about higher order moments of the underlying probability
distribution. We demonstrate the method using a dimerisation reaction,
Michaelis-Menten kinetics and a model of an oscillating p53 system. We show
that for the dimerisation reaction and Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics system
higher order moments have limited influence on the estimation of the mean,
while for the p53 system, the solution for the mean can require several moments
to converge to the average obtained from many stochastic simulations. We also
find that agreement between lower order moments does not guarantee that higher
moments will agree. Compared to stochastic simulations our approach is
numerically highly efficient at capturing the behaviour of stochastic systems
in terms of the average and higher moments, and we provide expressions for the
computational cost for different system sizes and orders of approximation. {We
show how the moment expansion method can be employed to efficiently {quantify
parameter sensitivity}.} Finally we investigate the effects of using too few
moments on parameter estimation, and provide guidance on how to estimate if the
distribution can be accurately approximated using only a few moments.

stars. This comparison gives insight into the analogies/differences in the
physics of the star-disk interaction and in the physical mechanisms driving
disk dissipation.
  Several optical and near-IR line luminosities used for low-mass objects are
also valid to estimate typical accretion rates for intermediate-mass stars
under similar empirical expressions. In contrast, the Halpha width at 10% of
peak intensity is used as an accretion tracer for T Tauris, but is not reliable
to estimate accretion rates for Herbig Ae/Bes. This can be explained as a
consequence of the different stellar rotation rates that characterize both
types of stars. In addition, there are similar trends when the accretion rate
is related to the near-IR colours and disk masses, suggesting that viscous
accretion disk models are able to explain these trends for both T Tauri and
Herbig Ae/Be stars. However, there are two major differences between cool and
hot PMS objects. First, the inner gas dissipation timescale, as estimated by
relating the accretion rates and the stellar ages, is slightly faster for
Herbig Ae/Be stars. This could have implications on the physical mechanism able
to form planets around objects more massive than the Sun. Second, the relative
position of Herbig Ae/Bes with disks showing signs of inner dust clearing in
the accretion rate--disk mass plane contrasts with that of transitional T Tauri
stars, when both samples are compared with ""classical"", non-evolved disks. This
latter difference could be pointing to a different physical mechanism driving
disk evolution, depending on the stellar regime.

Barab\'asi and Albert (1999) assumes a linear relationship between the number
of neighbors of a node in a network and the probability of attachment. Although
this assumption is widely made in Web Science and related fields, the
underlying linearity is rarely measured. To fill this gap, this paper performs
an empirical longitudinal (time-based) study on forty-seven diverse Web network
datasets from seven network categories and including directed, undirected and
bipartite networks. We show that contrary to the usual assumption, preferential
attachment is nonlinear in the networks under consideration. Furthermore, we
observe that the deviation from linearity is dependent on the type of network,
giving sublinear attachment in certain types of networks, and superlinear
attachment in others. Thus, we introduce the preferential attachment exponent
$\beta$ as a novel numerical network measure that can be used to discriminate
different types of networks. We propose explanations for the behavior of that
network measure, based on the mechanisms that underly the growth of the network

Si analogue of graphene. The conductance shows the distinct gate-voltage
dependences peculiar to the topological and non-topological phases, where the
topological phase transition is caused by external electric field. Namely, the
conductance is suppressed in the np regime when the both sides are topological,
while in the nn regime when one side is topological and the other side is
non-topological. Furthermore, we find that the conductance is almost quantized
to be 0, 1 and 2. Our findings will open a new way to nanoelectronics based on
silicene.

and examine several state-of-the-art parametrizations of GPDs. Future
directions in this active field are discussed.

  spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate","5 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cond-mat.quant-gas","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We show two kinds of inhomogeneous spin domain possessing N\'{e}el-like
domain walls in spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate, which are induced by the
positive and negative quadratic Zeeman effect (QZE) respectively. In both
cases, the spin density distribution is inhomogeneous and has zeros where the
magnetization vanishes. For positive and negative QZE, the spin patterns and
topological structures are remarkably different. Such phenomena are due to the
pointwise different axisymmetry-breaking caused by the pointwise different
population exchange between the sublevels, arising uniquely from the QZE. We
analyze in detail the inhomogeneous domain formation and related experimental
observations for the spin-1 $^{87}$Rb and $^{23}$Na condensate.

point-like structures by smeared objects. In the first part of the paper we
assume the power-law form $f(R)=aR^n$ and discuss several solutions
corresponding to different values of the exponent. The second part of the paper
assumes a particular form of the shape function that also yields a viable
solution. This investigation generalizes some of our previous work in $f(R)$
gravity, as well as in noncommutative geometry.

Chip (SoC) designs due to their inherent disadvantages such as non-scalability,
saturation and congestion. Currently very few tools are available for the
simulation and evaluation of on-chip architectures. This study proposes a
generic object oriented model for performance evaluation of on-chip
interconnect architectures and algorithms. The generic nature of the proposed
model can help the researchers in evaluation of any kind of on-chip switching
networks. The model was applied on 2D-Mesh and 2D-Diagonal-Mesh on-chip
switching networks for verification and selection of best out of both the
analyzed architectures. The results show the superiority of 2D-Diagonal-Mesh
over 2D-Mesh in terms of average packet delay.

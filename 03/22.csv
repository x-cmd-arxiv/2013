Method, DFPM. It is based on the idea of formulating a finite dimensional

possible to apply efficient symplectic integrators. Other attractive properties
of DFPM are that it has an exponential convergence rate, automatically includes
a sparse formulation and in many cases can solve nonlinear problems without any
special treatment. We study the convergence and convergence rate of DFPM. It is
shown that for the discretized symmetric eigenvalue problems the computational
complexity is given by $\mathcal{O}(N^{(d+1)/{d}})$, where \emph{d} is the
dimension of the problem and \emph{N} is the vector size. An illustrative

electron states at band edges (""valleys"") to have additional spin-like quantum

performed on such valley pseudospins, analogous to that routinely implemented
using true spin, in the quest for quantum technologies. Here we show for the
first time that SU(2) valley coherence can indeed be generated and detected.
Using monolayer semiconductor WSe2 devices, we first establish the circularly
polarized optical selection rules for addressing individual valley excitons and
trions. We then reveal coherence between valley excitons through the
observation of linearly polarized luminescence, whose orientation always
coincides with that of any linearly polarized excitation. Since excitons in a
single valley emit circularly polarized photons, linear polarization can only
be generated through recombination of an exciton in a coherent superposition of
the two valleys. In contrast, the corresponding photoluminescence from trions
is not linearly polarized, consistent with the expectation that the emitted
photon polarization is entangled with valley pseudospin. The ability to address
coherence, in addition to valley polarization, adds a critical dimension to the
quantum manipulation of valley index necessary for coherent valleytronics.

analytic potential on the line. Evolving such vessels we generate KdV vessels,
realizing solutions of the KdV equation. As a consequence, we prove the
following theorem:
  Suppose that q(x) is an analytic function on R. There exists a KdV vessel,
which exists on a subset O of the plane. For each real x there exists positive
T_x such that $\{x\}\times [-T_x,T_x]$ is in O. The potential q(x) is realized
by the vessel for t=0.
  Since we also show that if q(x,t) is a solution of the KdV equation on a
strip $R\times[0,T]$, then there exists a vessel, realizing it, the theory of
vessels becomes a universal tool to study this problem. Finally, we notice that
the idea of the proof applies to a similar existence of a solution for
evolutionary NLS and Boussinesq equations, since both of these equations
possess vessel constructions.

noted that, for reactions such as the production of a J/psi by light
quark-antiquark fusion, the colour-singlet contribution via an off-shell photon
is of the order of the expectation from the colour-octet contribution via an

  If V is a tropical hypersurface defined over the field of real Puiseux
series, it has a real part RV which is a polyhedral complex. We define the
total curvature of V (resp. RV) by using the total curvature of Amoebas and
passing to the limit.
  We also define the ""polyhedral total curvature"" of the real part RV of a
generic tropical hypersurface.
  The main results we prove about these notions are the following:
  - The fact that the total curvature and the polyhedral total curvature
coincide for real non-singular tropical hypersurfaces.
  - A universal inequality between the total curvatures of V and RV and another
between the logarithmic curvatures of the real and complex parts of a real
algebraic hypersurface.
  -The fact that this inequality is sharp in the non-singular case.

morphological peculiarities, suggesting that interactions within the group may
be caused by stripping of the magnetic field. This process could supply the
intergalactic space with magnetised material, a scenario considered as a
possible source of intergalactic magnetic fields (as seen eg. in the Taffy
pairs of galaxies). Additionally, the plumes are likely to be the tidal dwarf
galaxy candidates.
  Methods. We performed radio continuum mapping observations at 2.64 GHz using
the 100-m Effelsberg radio telescope. We obtained total power and polarised
intensity maps of the Triplet. These maps were analysed together with the
archive data, and the magnetic field strength (as well as the magnetic energy
density) was estimated.
  Results. Extended emission was not detected either in the total power or the
polarised intensity maps. We obtained upper limits of the magnetic field
strength and the energy density of the magnetic field in the Triplet. We
detected emission from the easternmost clump and determined the strength of its
magnetic field. In addition, we measured integrated fluxes of the member
galaxies at 2.64 GHz and estimated their total magnetic field strengths.
  Conclusions. We found that the tidal tail hosts a tidal dwarf galaxy
candidate that possesses a detectable magnetic field with a non-zero ordered
component. Extended radio continuum emission, if present, is weaker than the
reached confusion limit. The total magnetic field strength does not exceed 2.8
{\mu}G and the ordered component is lower than 1.6 {\mu}G.

power spectrum (PPS). However, in the absence of a preferred model for the
early universe, this raises a concern that current cosmological parameter
estimates are strongly prejudiced by the assumed power-law form of PPS. In this
paper, for the first time, we perform cosmological parameter estimation
allowing the free form of the primordial spectrum. This is in fact the most
general approach to estimate cosmological parameters without assuming any
particular form for the primordial spectrum. We use direct reconstruction of
the PPS for any point in the cosmological parameter space using recently
modified Richardson-Lucy algorithm however other alternative reconstruction
methods could be used for this purpose as well. We use WMAP 9 year data in our
analysis considering CMB lensing effect and we report, for the first time, that
the flat spatial universe with no cosmological constant is ruled out by more
than 4\sigma confidence limit without assuming any particular form of the
primordial spectrum. This would be probably the most robust indication for dark
energy using CMB data alone. Our results on the estimated cosmological
parameters show that higher values of baryonic and matter density and lower
value of Hubble parameter (in comparison to the estimated values by assuming
power-law PPS) is preferred by the data. However, the estimated cosmological
parameters by assuming free form of the PPS have overlap at 1\sigma confidence
level with the estimated values assuming power-law form of PPS.

confirm the occurrence of in-phase and inverse-phase synchronization phenomena

concept of localized sets computed directly from the experimental time-series

check of the currently favored cosmological model (flat LambdaCDM) and

measurements to assess consistency and determine whether extensions to the
model are justified. At current precision, there is no significant tension
between the locally measured Hubble constant and age of the Universe (with
errors of 3% and 5% respectively) and the corresponding parameters derived from
the CMB. However, if errors on the local measurements could be decreased by a
factor of two, one could decisively conclude if there is tension or not. We
also compare the local and CMB data assuming simple extensions of the flat,
$\Lambda$CDM model (including curvature, dark energy with a constant equation
of state parameter not equal to -1, non-zero neutrino masses and a non-standard
number of neutrino families) and find no need for these extra parameters; in
particular, we constrain the effective number of neutrino species to be Neff <

curvature and equation of state of dark energy nearly orthogonal to those of
the CMB. We argue that cosmology-independent measurements of local quantities

involve only external photons and the background electromagnetic field. We show
analytically that such processes occurring in a plane-wave field and involving
external real photons are all characterized by a surprisingly modest net
exchange of energy and momentum with the laser field, corresponding to a few
laser photons, even in the limit of ultra-relativistic laser intensities. We
obtain this result by a direct calculation of the transition matrix element of
an arbitrary refractive QED process and accounting exactly for the background
plane-wave field. A simple physical explanation of this modest net exchange of
laser photons is provided, based on the fact that the laser field couples with
the external photons only indirectly through virtual electron-positron pairs.
For stronger and stronger laser fields, the pairs cover a shorter and shorter
distance before they annihilate again, such that the laser can transfer to them
an energy corresponding to only a few photons. These results can be relevant
for future experiments aiming to test strong-field QED at present and

too deep in the solar atmosphere for the resulting photon to escape the solar
surface and be detected before Compton scattering obscures the line. At the
(detectable) axion masses below this, the flux of mode converted photons
predicted by axion models appears to be too low for detection to be feasible
with current instrumentation. Nonresonant mode conversion for axion masses
below 10^-4 eV is also plausible, but with still lower predicted fluxes, since
the axion coupling constant is related to it mass. Prospects for meaningful
constraints on massive axion parameters from X-ray observations of this
transition from the Sun do not appear to be promising. However parameters for
massless counterparts (e.g. the ""arion"") may still result from such
observations. It may mode convert in the outer layers of the solar atmosphere,
but is not restricted by this to have a small coupling constant.

level of graphene have revealed some striking differences between filling
factors in the ranges 0<|\nu|<1 and 1<|\nu|<2. We argue that these differences
can be largely understood as a consequence of the effects of terms in the
Hamiltonian which break SU(2) valley symmetry, which we find to be important
for |\nu|<1 but negligible for |\nu| >1. The effective absence of valley
anisotropy for |\nu|>1 means that states with odd numerator, e.g. |\nu|=5/3 or
7/5 can accommodate charged excitations in the form of large valley skyrmions,
which have a low energy cost, and may be easily induced by coupling to
impurities. The absence of observed quantum Hall states at these fractions is
likely due to the effects of valley skyrmions. For |\nu|<1, the anisotropy
terms favor phases in which electrons occupy states with opposite spins,
similar to the antiferromagnetic state previously hypothesized to be the ground
state at \nu=0. The anisotropy and Zeeman energies suppress large-area
skyrmions, so that quantized Hall states can be observable at a set of
fractions similar to those in GaAs two-dimensional electron systems. In a
perpendicular magnetic field B, the competition between the Coulomb energy,
which varies as B^{1/2}, and the Zeeman energy, which varies as B, can explain
the observation of apparent phase transitions as a function of B for fixed \nu,
as transitions between states with different degrees of spin polarization. In
addition to an analysis of various fractional states, and an examination of the
effects of disorder on valley skyrmions, we present new experimental data for
the energy gaps at integer fillings \nu=0 and \nu= -1, as a function of
magnetic field, and we examine the possibility that valley-skyrmions may
account for the smaller energy gaps observed at \nu= -1.

call it the zero-generic initial ideal of I with respect to the order and
denote it with gin_0(I), or with Gin_0(I) whenever the order is the
reverse-lexicographic order. When the characteristic of K is zero, a
zero-generic initial ideal is the usual generic initial ideal. We show that
Gin_0(I) is endowed with many interesting properties, some of which are easily
seen, e.g., it is a strongly stable monomial ideal in any characteristic, and
has the same Hilbert series as I; some other properties are less obvious: it
shares with I the same Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, projective dimension and
extremal Betti numbers. Quite surprisingly, gin_0(I) also satisfies Green's
Crystallization Principle, which is known to fail in positive characteristic.
Thus, zero-generic initial ideals can be used as formal analogues of generic
initial ideals computed in characteristic 0. We also prove the analogue for
local cohomology of Pardue's Conjecture for Betti numbers: we show that the

K. Stephenson defines a conformal pentagonal tiling. This is a tiling of the
plane with remarkable combinatorial and geometric properties. However, it
doesn't have finite local complexity in any usual sense, and therefore we
cannot study it with the usual tiling theory. The appeal of the tiling is that
all the tiles are conformally regular pentagons. But conformal maps are not
allowable under finite local complexity. On the other hand, the tiling can be
described completely by its combinatorial data, which rather automatically has
finite local complexity. In this paper we give a construction of the discrete
hull just from the combinatorial data. The main result of this paper is that
the discrete hull is a Cantor space.

the \emph{quenched} LDP (= conditional on a typical letter sequence) was

sequence satisfies a mixing condition called \emph{summable variation}. The

reference laws is i.i.d., several approximation arguments are needed to obtain
the extension.

the solutions to the BBGKY hierarchy satisfy the space-time bound conjectured

Klainerman-Machedon uniqueness theorem, and hence implies that the limit is
uniquely determined as a tensor product of solutions to the Gross-Pitaevski

electroweak fine-tuning for such a light neutralino scenario in view of the
null results from the searches for supersymmetry so far. Using a Markov Chain
Monte Carlo likelihood analysis of the full pMSSM parameter space, we find that
a neutralino DM with mass > 10 GeV can in principle still satisfy all the
existing constraints. Our light neutralino solutions can be broadly divided
into two regions: (i) The solutions in the 10 - 30 GeV neutralino mass range
are highly fine-tuned and require the existence of light selectrons (below 100
GeV) in order to satisfy the observed DM relic density. We note that these are
not yet conclusively ruled out by the existing LEP/LHC results, and a dedicated
analysis valid for a non-unified gaugino mass spectrum is required to exclude
this possibility. (ii) The solutions with low fine-tuning are mainly in the 30
- 46 GeV neutralino mass range. However, a major portion of it is already ruled
out by the latest XENON100 upper limits on its spin-independent direct
detection cross section, and the rest of the allowed points are within the
XENON1T projected limit. Thus, we show that the allowed MSSM parameter space
for a light neutralino DM below the LEP limit of 46 GeV, possible in
supersymmetric models without gaugino mass unification, could be completely
accessible in near future. This might be useful in view of the recent claims
for positive hints of a DM signal in some direct detection experiments.

radiative cooling of the low-entropy gas at the centers of galaxy clusters and
in mitigating the star formation of elliptical galaxies. New observations of
M87 enable us to put forward a comprehensive model for the physical heating
mechanism. Low-frequency radio observations by LOFAR revealed the absence of
fossil cosmic-ray (CR) electrons in the radio halo surrounding M87. This puzzle
can be resolved by accounting for the CR release from the radio cocoons and the
subsequent mixing of CRs with the dense ambient intracluster gas, which
thermalizes the electrons on a timescale similar to the radio halo age of 40
Myr. Hadronic interactions of similarly injected CR protons with the ambient
gas should produce an observable gamma-ray signal in accordance with the steady
emission of the low state of M87 detected by Fermi and H.E.S.S. Hence, we
normalize the CR population to the gamma-ray emission, which shows the same
spectral slope as the CR injection spectrum probed by LOFAR, thereby supporting
a common origin. We show that CRs, which stream at the Alfven velocity with
respect to the plasma rest frame, heat the surrounding thermal plasma at a rate
that balances that of radiative cooling on average at each radius. However, the
resulting global thermal equilibrium is locally unstable and allows for the
formation of the observed cooling multi-phase medium through thermal
instability. Provided that CR heating balances cooling during the emerging
""cooling flow,"" the collapse of the majority of the gas is halted around 1 keV
- in accordance with X-ray data. We show that both the existence of a
temperature floor and the similar radial scaling of the heating and cooling
rates are generic predictions of the CR heating model.

in association with two jets interfaced to parton showers using the POWHEG BOX.
We incorporate matrix elements from the parton-level Monte Carlo program MCFM
in the POWHEG BOX, allowing for a considerable improvement in speed compared to
previous implementations. We address certain problems that arise when processes
that are singular at the Born level are implemented in a shower framework using
either a generation cut or a Born suppression factor to yield weighted events.
In such a case, events with very large weights can be generated after the
shower through a number of mechanisms. Events with very small transverse
momentum at the Born level can develop large transverse momentum either after
the hardest emission, after the shower, or after the inclusion of multi-parton
interactions. We present a solution to this problem that can be easily
implemented in the POWHEG BOX. We also show that a full solution to this
problem can only be achieved if the generator maintains physical validity also
when the transverse momentum of the emitted partons becomes unresolved. One
such scheme is the recently-proposed MiNLO method for the choice of scale and
the exponentiation of Sudakov form factors in NLO computations. We present a
validation study of our generators, by comparing their output to available LHC
data.

induced streaming potential of a pressure-driven symmetric electrolyte in a
slit channel is investigated. Based on the non-isothermal Nernst-Planck
equations as well as the Poisson equation in the lubrication approximation,
expressions for the ion distribution in the electric double layer (EDL) are
derived. It is found that thermophoretic ion motion and a temperature-dependent
electrophoretic ion mobility increase the local EDL thickness with temperature,
whereas a temperature-dependent permittivity shrinks the EDL. Within the
Debye-H\""uckel approximation, the Navier-Stokes equation with the corresponding
electric body force terms is solved. Analytical expressions for the flow
profile and the induced (streaming) field under non-isothermal conditions are
derived. It is shown that for such a situation the induced electric field is
the linear superposition of at least seven individual contributions. For very
wide channels, only the thermoelectric field typically present in bulk
electrolytes when subjected to a temperature gradient (Soret equilibrium) as
well as the conventional pressure-induced streaming field are of importance.
Under extreme confinement, selective thermo-electro-migration driven by the
interplay between the temperature-dependent electrophoretic ion mobility and
the interaction of the ions with the surface wall charge causes a
thermoelectric field of non-advective origin. For wider channels and besides
the well-known thermoosmosis due to the temperature dependence of the
dielectric permittivity, it is demonstrated that a temperature gradient renders
the ion cloud in the EDL out of mechanical equilibrium. This leads to a
thermoosmotic flow, and the ion advection affiliated with it may induce a
thermoelectric field of similar order of magnitude as the one caused by more
conventional thermal effects.

that each component of the magnetic field causes a competing effect on the

of the magnetic field tends to make the chiral symmetry breaking stronger, the
effect of the parallel component of the field in these planar systems is to
weaken the chiral symmetry through the enhancement of the Zeeman energy term.
We show that this competing effect, when combined also with temperature and
chemical potential, can lead to a rich phase diagram, with the emergence of
multiple critical points and reentrant phase transitions. We also study how the
presence of these multiple critical points and reentrant phases can manifest in
the quantum Hall effect. Our results provide a possible way to probe

momentum of the inner and outer regions of the disk. We begin a systematic
simulational inquiry into the physics of warped disks with the simplest case:
the relaxation of an unforced warp under pure fluid dynamics, i.e. with no
internal stresses other than Reynolds stress. We focus on the nonlinear regime
in which the bend rate is large compared to the disk aspect ratio. When warps
are nonlinear, strong radial pressure gradients drive transonic radial motions
along the disk's top and bottom surfaces that efficiently mix angular momentum.
The resulting nonlinear decay rate of the warp increases with the warp rate and
the warp width, but, at least in the parameter regime studied here, is
independent of the sound speed. The characteristic magnitude of the associated
angular momentum fluxes likewise increases with both the local warp rate and
the radial range over which the warp extends; it also increases with increasing
sound speed, but more slowly than linearly. The angular momentum fluxes respond
to the warp rate after a delay that scales with the square-root of the time for
sound waves to cross the radial extent of the warp. These behaviors are at
variance with a number of the assumptions commonly used in analytic models to
describe linear warp dynamics.

  32 pages, 12 figures, 6 sections",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An efficient direct solver for volume integral equations with O(N) complexity
for a broad range of problems is presented. The solver relies on hierarchical
compression of the discretized integral operator, and exploits that
off-diagonal blocks of certain dense matrices have numerically low rank.
Technically, the solver is inspired by previously developed direct solvers for
integral equations based on ""recursive skeletonization"" and ""Hierarchically
Semi-Separable"" (HSS) matrices, but it improves on the asymptotic complexity of
existing solvers by incorporating an additional level of compression. The
resulting solver has optimal O(N) complexity for all stages of the computation,
as demonstrated by both theoretical analysis and numerical examples. The
computational examples further display good practical performance in terms of
both speed and memory usage. In particular, it is demonstrated that even
problems involving 10^{7} unknowns can be solved to precision 10^{-10} using a
simple Matlab implementation of the algorithm executed on a single core.

to perform non-LTE analyses of the spectra of hot massive stars, and include
sphericity and mass-loss. The two codes differ primarily in their approach
towards line blanketing, with CMFGEN treating all of the lines in the co-moving
frame and FASTWIND taking an approximate approach which speeds up execution
times considerably. Although both have been extensively used to model the
spectra of O-type stars, no studies have used the codes to independently model
the same spectra of the same stars and compare the derived physical properties.
We perform this task on ten O-type stars in the Magellanic Clouds. For the
late-type O supergiants, both CMFGEN and FASTWIND have trouble fitting some of
the He I lines, and we discuss causes and cures. We find that there is no
difference in the average effective temperatures found by the two codes for the
stars in our sample, although the dispersion is large, due primarily to the
various difficulties each code has with He I. The surface gravities determined
using FASTWIND are systematically lower by 0.12 dex compared to CMFGEN, a
result we attribute to the better treatment of electron scattering by CMFGEN.
This has implications for the interpretation of the origin of the so-called
mass discrepancy, as the masses derived by FASTWIND are on average lower than
inferred from stellar evolutionary models, while those found by CMFGEN are in
better agreement.

is negligible for radiatively inefficient discs. For the standard thin disc
model it is a slight but potentially important effect leading to the
equilibrium spin parameter value of about 0.998. For optically thin discs, the
fraction of disc radiation captured by the black hole is however about two
times larger. In some disc radiation models, inner parts of the accretion flow
are optically thin, advection-dominated flows, and the thin disc ends at some
transition radius R_{tr}. The thermal energy of the disc stored in trapped
radiation is released at this radius. Angular distribution of the radiation
released at this radial photosphere facilitates its capture by the black hole.
For accretion rates close to critical and disc truncation radius of (2..4)
GM/c^2, radiation capture is most efficient in spinning the black hole down
that may lead to a_{eq} ~ 0.996..0.997 or less depending on the mass accretion

of the k elements that are smallest according to a given hash function h. With
this sample we can estimate the relative size f=|Y|/|X| of any subset Y as
|S_k(X) intersect Y|/k. A standard application is the estimation of the Jaccard
similarity f=|A intersect B|/|A union B| between sets A and B. Given the
bottom-k samples from A and B, we construct the bottom-k sample of their union
as S_k(A union B)=S_k(S_k(A) union S_k(B)), and then the similarity is
estimated as |S_k(A union B) intersect S_k(A) intersect S_k(B)|/k.
  We show here that even if the hash function is only 2-independent, the
expected relative error is O(1/sqrt(fk)). For fk=Omega(1) this is within a
constant factor of the expected relative error with truly random hashing.
  For comparison, consider the classic approach of kxmin-wise where we use k
hash independent functions h_1,...,h_k, storing the smallest element with each
hash function. For kxmin-wise there is an at least constant bias with constant
independence, and it is not reduced with larger k. Recently Feigenblat et al.
showed that bottom-k circumvents the bias if the hash function is 8-independent
and k is sufficiently large. We get down to 2-independence for any k. Our
result is based on a simply union bound, transferring generic concentration
bounds for the hashing scheme to the bottom-k sample, e.g., getting stronger
probability error bounds with higher independence.
  For weighted sets, we consider priority sampling which adapts efficiently to
the concrete input weights, e.g., benefiting strongly from heavy-tailed input.
This time, the analysis is much more involved, but again we show that generic
concentration bounds can be applied.

the UV to 2.4 microns in the NIR. Optical spectra provide line profiles and
velocity measurements of HI, HeI, CaII and FeII that trace the composition and
kinematics of the SN. NIR spectra show that helium is present in the atmosphere
as early as 11 days after the explosion. A UV spectrum obtained with the STIS
reveals that the UV flux for SN 2011dh is low compared to other SN IIb. The HI
and HeI velocities in SN 2011dh are separated by about 4,000 km/s at all
phases. We estimate that the H-shell of SN 2011dh is about 8 times less massive
than the shell of SN 1993J and about 3 times more massive than the shell of SN
2008ax. Light curves (LC) for twelve passbands are presented. The maximum
bolometric luminosity of $1.8 \pm 0.2 \times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ occurred
about 22 days after the explosion. NIR emission provides more than 30% of the
total bolometric flux at the beginning of our observations and increases to
nearly 50% of the total by day 34. The UV produces 16% of the total flux on day
4, 5% on day 9 and 1% on day 34. We compare the bolometric light curves of SN
2011dh, SN 2008ax and SN 1993J. The LC are very different for the first twelve
days after the explosions but all three SN IIb display similar peak
luminosities, times of peak, decline rates and colors after maximum. This
suggests that the progenitors of these SN IIb may have had similar compositions
and masses but they exploded inside hydrogen shells that that have a wide range
of masses. The detailed observations presented here will help evaluate
theoretical models for this supernova and lead to a better understanding of SN
IIb.

B-type asteroids and extend on the previous work by studying their physical
properties derived from fitting an asteroid thermal model to their NASA's
Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) data. We also examine the Pallas
collisional family, a B-type family with a moderately high albedo in contrast
to the large majority of B-types. Methods: We apply a combination of the NEATM
and a model of the reflected sunlight to WISE asteroid data in order to derive
effective diameter (D), the so-called infrared beaming parameter (\eta), ratio
of infrared to visible albedo (R_p = p_{IR}/p_V) and visible geometric albedo
(p_V). Results: We obtained parameter values for $\ga$ 100 B-types asteroids
and plotted the value distributions of p_V, R_p and \eta (p_V = 0.07 +- 0.03$,
R_p = 1.0 +- 0.2, and \eta = 1.0 +- 0.1). By combining the IR and visible
albedos with 2.5-micron reflectances from the literature we obtained the ratio
of reflectances at 3.4 and 2.5 micron, from which we found statistically
significant indications that the presence of a 3-micron absorption band related
to water may be commonplace among the B-types. Finally, the Pallas collisional
family members studied ($\sim$ 50 objects) present moderately high values of
p_V (p_V = 0.14 +- 0.05), significantly higher than the average albedo of
B-types. In addition, this family presents the lowest and most homogeneously
distributed R_p-values of our whole sample, which shows that this group is
clearly different from the rest, likely because its members are pieces probably
originating from the same region of (2) Pallas, a particularly high-albedo
B-type asteroid.

Stream(VSS)/Virgo Overdensity(VOD) and compare them to a field centred on the
highest concentration of Sagittarius (Sgr) Tidal Stream stars in the leading
arm, Branch A of the bifurcation. A prominent population of MS stars is
detected in all three fields and can be traced as faint as g~24 mag. Using
theoretical isochrone fitting we derive an age of 9.1(+1.0;-1.1)Gyr, a median
abundance of [Fe/H]=-0.70 (+0.15; -0.20)dex and d_helio of 30.9+-3.0kpc for the
MS of the Sgr Stream Branch A. The dominant main sequence populations in the
two VSS/VOD fields (Lsun ~265 deg, Bsun ~13 deg) are located at a mean distance
of 23.3+-1.6kpc and have an age ~8.2Gyr and an abundance
[Fe/H]=-0.67(+0.16;-0.12)dex similar to the Sgr Stream stars. These parameters
are also in good agreement with the age of the main population in the
Sagittarius dwarf (8.0+-1.5Gyr). They also agree with the peak in the
metallicity distribution of 2-3Gyr old M-giants, [Fe/H] ~ -0.6dex, in the Sgr
leading arm north. We then compare the results from the VSS/VOD fields with the
Sgr Tidal Stream model by Law & Majewski based on a triaxial Galactic halo that
is calibrated with SDSS Sgr A-branch and 2MASS M-giant stars. We find that the
most prominent feature in the CMDs, the MS population at 23kpc, is not
explained by the model. Instead the model predicts in these directions a low
density filamentary structure of Sgr debris stars at ~9kpc and a slightly
higher concentration of Sgr stars spread from 42-53kpc. At best there is only
marginal evidence for the presence of these populations in our data. Our
findings then suggest that while there are probably some Sgr debris stars
present, the dominant stellar population in the VOD originates from a different
halo structure that has almost identical age and metallicity as some sections
of the Sgr tidal stream.

(M$_{BH}$) and the stellar mass of the host spheroid (M$_{sph,*}$) for a sample

2MASS K$_s$-band photometry from the ARCHANGEL photometry pipeline. Dividing
our sample into core-S\'ersic and S\'ersic galaxies, we find that they are
described by very different M$_{BH}$-M$_{sph,*}$ relations. For core-S\'ersic
galaxies - which are typically massive and luminous, with M$_{BH} \gtrsim
2x10^8 M_\odot$ - we find M$_{BH} \propto M_{sph,*}^{(0.97 \pm 0.14)}$,
consistent with other literature relations. However, for the S\'ersic galaxies

M$_BH \propto M_{sph,*}^{(2.22 \pm 0.58)}$, a dramatically steeper slope that
differs by more than 2 standard deviations. This relation confirms that, for
S\'ersic galaxies, M$_{BH}$ is not a constant fraction of M$_{sph,*}$. S\'ersic
galaxies can grow via the accretion of gas which fuels both star formation and
the central black hole, as well as through merging. Their black hole grows
significantly more rapidly than their host spheroid, prior to growth by dry
merging events that produce core-S\'ersic galaxies, where the black hole and
spheroid grow in lock step. We have additionally compared our S\'ersic
M$_{BH}$-M$_{sph,*}$ relation with the corresponding relation for nuclear star
clusters, confirming that the two classes of central massive object follow
significantly different scaling relations.

and identically distributed (i.i.d) compressive distributions to fundamentally
quantify the achievable reconstruction performance of compressed sensing for
certain encoder-decoder pairs at a given sampling ratio. Two lower bounds on
the achievable performance and the intrinsic convexity property is derived. A
zeroing procedure is then introduced to improve non convex SD functions. The SD
framework is then applied to analyse compressed imaging with a multi-resolution
statistical image model using both the generalized Gaussian distribution and
the two-state Gaussian mixture distribution. We subsequently focus on the
Gaussian encoder-Bayesian optimal approximate message passing (AMP) decoder
pair, whose theoretical SD function is provided by the rigorous analysis of the
AMP algorithm. Given the image statistics, analytic bandwise sample allocation
for bandwise independent model is derived as a reverse water-filling scheme.
Som and Schniter's turbo message passing approach is further deployed to
integrate the bandwise sampling with the exploitation of the hidden Markov tree
structure of wavelet coefficients. Natural image simulations confirm that with
oracle image statistics, the SD function associated with the optimized sample
allocation can accurately predict the possible compressed sensing gains.
Finally, a general sample allocation profile based on average image statistics
not only illustrates preferable performance but also makes the scheme
practical.

competing crystallization and glass transitions. For quench rates slower than
the critical nucleation rate $|\dot{T}|_{crit}$, systems exhibit a first-order
crystallization transition below a critical temperature $T=T_{cryst}$. Such
systems form close-packed crystallites of FCC and/or HCP order, separated by
domain walls, twin defects, and an amorphous interphase. The size of amorphous
regions grows continuously as the quench rate $|\dot{T}|$ increases, producing
nearly amorphous structure for $|\dot{T}|>|\dot{T}|_{crit}$. Our model exhibits
many features observed in recent studies of crystallization of athermal polymer
packings, but also critical differences arising from the softness of the pair
interactions and the thermal nature of the phase transition. The model is
considerably more computationally efficient than other recent crystallizable
coarse-grained polymer models; while it sacrifices some features of real
semicrystalline polymers (such as lamellar structure and chain
disentanglement), we anticipate that it will serve as a useful model for
studying generic features related to semicrystalline order in polymer solids.

emission (EW(H$\alpha)>5$\AA), both X-ray and optical spectral analysis are
performed on 67 (partially) obscured AGNs that are selected from the \it
XMM-Newton\rm\ 2XMMi/SDSS-DR7 catalog originally cross-matched by Pineau et al.
The sample allows us to study central AGN activity and host galaxy directly and
simultaneously in individual objects. Combining the spectral analysis in both
bands reveals that the older the stellar population of the host galaxy, the
harder the X-ray emission will be, which was missed in our previous study where
the \it ROSAT\rm\ hardness ratios are used. By excluding the contamination from
the host galaxies and from the jet beaming emission, the correlation indicates
that the Compton cooling in the accretion disk corona decreases with the mean
age of the stellar population. We argue that the correlation is related to the
correlation of $L/L_{\mathrm{Edd}}$ with the host stellar population. In
addition, the [\ion{O}{1}]/H$\alpha$ and [\ion{S}{2}]/H$\alpha$ narrow-line
ratios are identified to correlate with the spectral slope in hard X-ray, which
can be inferred from the currently proposed evolution of the X-ray emission
because of the confirmed tight correlations between the two line ratios and
stellar population age.

One has a conserved number of particles, the other does not. In the latter we
show that the sequence of fixed spins can be viewed as an additional boundary
in imaginary time. We then use conformal field theory (CFT) techniques to
derive all universal terms in its scaling, and provide checks in free fermionic
systems. These are based on numerical simulations or, when possible,
mathematical results on the asymptotic behavior of Toeplitz and Toeplitz+Hankel
determinants. A perturbed CFT analysis uncovers an interesting $\ell^{-1}\log

statistics. The XXZ case turns out to be more challenging, as scale invariance
is broken. We use a simple qualitative picture in which the ferromagnetic
sequence of spins freezes all degrees of freedom inside of a certain ""arctic""

the existence of universal logarithmic terms, generated by the massless field

the INTEGRAL/IBIS data. From 2005 to 2011, the spin period of the neutron star
in 4U 2206+54 varies from \sim 5558 s to 5588 s. The average spin-down rate in
the last 20 years is derived as \sim 5\times 10^{-7} s s^{-1}. 4U 2206+54 is a
variable source with luminosities of \sim 10^{35} - 10^{36} erg s^{-1} in the
range of 3 -- 100 keV. Its spectrum can be described by an absorbed power-law
model with exponential rolloff. The hydrogen column density and photon index
show the anti-correlations with hard X-ray luminosity: low column density and
small photon index at maximum of luminosity. This spectral variation pattern
suggests that 4U 2206+54 would be a highly obscured binary system. Furthermore,
the possible cyclotron line features are searched for in the spectra of
different luminosities. The possible cyclotron absorption feature around 30 keV
is not confirmed in our work. The physical origin and evolutional track of this
very slow pulsation neutron star are still unclear. We suggest that 4U 2206+54

longer spin period range and transit to the spin-up phase similar to 2S

imaging problems. Its use in real-time applications requires fast projection
onto the low-dimensional space. To this end, out-of-sample extensions are
applied by constructing an interpolation function that maps from the input
space to the low-dimensional manifold. Commonly used approaches such as the
Nystr\""{o}m extension and kernel ridge regression require using all training
points. We propose an interpolation function that only depends on a small
subset of the input training data. Consequently, in the testing phase each new
point only needs to be compared against a small number of input training data
in order to project the point onto the low-dimensional space. We interpret our
method as an out-of-sample extension that approximates kernel ridge regression.
Our method involves solving a simple convex optimization problem and has the
attractive property of guaranteeing an upper bound on the approximation error,
which is crucial for medical applications. Tuning this error bound controls the
sparsity of the resulting interpolation function. We illustrate our method in
two clinical applications that require fast mapping of input images onto a
low-dimensional space.

multicomponent wave functions which transform covariantly according to
Lorentz-group representations that contain at rest the spin of interest. The
symmetry group of space-time provides not one but an infinity of such
representations which are equivalent for free particles but yield different
electromagnetic couplings upon gauging; thus the challenge is to develop
criteria which allow us to select those of them which relate to physically
detectable particles. We here take the position that the unitarity of the
Compton scattering cross sections in the ultrarelativistic limit, when
predicted by a consistent method for a spin-$1$ description, could provide such
a criterion. We analyze the properties of massive fundamental spin-$1$ bosons
transforming as antisymmetric tensors of second rank, $(1,0)\oplus(0,1)$. For
this purpose, we employ the Poincar\'e covariant projector method, which
provides consistent, causal, and representation specific Lagrangians. This
formalism yields a twofold extension of the Proca Lagrangian for the
description of spin-$1$ bosons, first from an in-built $g=1$ value of the
gyromagnetic ratio to an unspecified $g\not=1$, and from, single-parity, to
parity-doublet degrees of freedom. We find different results for Compton
scattering in these theories and track the differences to the lack of
universality of the vector-antisymmetric-tensor equivalence theorem which is
specific only to Proca's framework, and valid for $g=1$, while it is violated
within the covariant projector formalism. Our main result is that a finite
Compton scattering differential cross section in the ultrarelativistic limit
requires us to consider the contributions of both parities in
$(1,0)\oplus(0,1)$. On that basis, we conclude that massive spin-$1$ bosons
transforming as antisymmetric tensors are physical parity doublets.

couplings is discussed. The scheme is based on synchronous measurements of
optical-magnetometer signals of several devices operating in magnetically
shielded environments in distant locations ($\gtrsim100$ km). Although
signatures of such exotic couplings may be present in the signal from a single
magnetometer, it would be challenging to distinguish them from noise. By
analyzing the correlation between signals from multiple, geographically
separated magnetometers, it is not only possible to identify the exotic
transient but also to investigate its nature. The ability of the network to
probe presently unconstrained physics beyond the Standard Model is examined by
considering the spin coupling to stable topological defects (e.g., domain
walls) of axion-like fields. In the spirit of this research, a brief ($\sim 2$
hours) demonstration experiment involving two magnetometers located in Krak\'ow
and Berkeley ($\sim 9000$ km separation) is presented and discussion of the
data-analysis approaches that may allow for the transient signal identification
is provided. The prospects of the network are outlined in the last part of the
paper.

to provide tools to characterise complex systems. In particular, we are
interested in quantifying information storage, information modification and
information transfer as characteristic elements of computation. Although these
quantities are defined for autonomous dynamical systems, information dynamics
can also help to get a ""wholistic"" understanding of input-driven systems such
as neural networks. In this case, we do not distinguish between the system
itself, and the effects the input has to the system. This may be desired in
some cases, but it will change the questions we are able to answer, and is
consequently an important consideration, for example, for biological systems
which perform non-trivial computations and also retain a short-term memory of
past inputs. Many other real world systems like cortical networks are also
heavily input-driven, and application of tools designed for autonomous dynamic
systems may not necessarily lead to intuitively interpretable results.
  The aim of our work is to extend the measurements used in the information
dynamics framework for input-driven systems. Using the proposed input-corrected
information storage we hope to better quantify system behaviour, which will be
important for heavily input-driven systems like artificial neural networks to
abstract from specific benchmarks, or for brain networks, where intervention is
difficult, individual components cannot be tested in isolation or with

distribution, and investigate what kind of dust processes determine the grain
size distribution at each stage of galaxy evolution. In addition to the dust
production by type II supernovae (SNeII) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
stars, we consider three processes in the ISM: (i) dust destruction by SN
shocks, (ii) metal accretion onto the surface of preexisting grains in the cold
neutral medium (CNM) (called grain growth), and (iii) grain-grain collisions
(shattering and coagulation) in the warm neutral medium (WNM) and CNM. We found
that the grain size distribution in galaxies is controlled by stellar sources
in the early stage of galaxy evolution, and that afterwards the main processes
that govern the size distribution changes to those in the ISM. Since shattering
produces a large abundance of small grains (consequently, the surface-to-volume
ratio of grains increases), it enhances the efficiency of grain growth,
contributing to the significant increase of the total dust mass. Grain growth
creates a large bump in the grain size distribution around a ~ 0.01 \mu m.
Coagulation occurs effectively after the number of small grains is enhanced by
shattering, and the grain size distribution is deformed to have a bump at a ~
0.03 - 0.05 \mu m at t ~ 10 Gyr. We conclude that the evolutions of the total
dust mass and the grain size distribution in galaxies are closely related to
each other, and the grain size distribution changes considerably through the
galaxy evolution because the dominant dust processes which regulate the grain
size distribution change.

in the lattice models of superfluids in the continuous approximation. The
continuous approximation restores translational invariance absent in the
original lattice model, but the theory is not Galilean invariant. As a result,
calculation of the two transverse forces on the vortex, Magnus force and
Lorentz force, requires the analysis of two balances, for the true momentum of
particles in the lattice (Magnus force) and for the quasimomentum (Lorentz
force) known from the Bloch theory of particles in the periodic potential.
While the developed theory yields the same Lorentz force, which was well known
before, a new general expression for the Magnus force was obtained. The theory
demonstrates how a small Magnus force emerges in the Josephson-junction array
if the particle-hole symmetry is broken. The continuous approximation for the
Bose--Hubbard model close to the superfluid-insulator transition was developed,
which was used for calculation of the Magnus force. The theory shows that there
is an area in the phase diagram for the Bose--Hubbard model, where the Magnus
force has an inverse sign with respect to that which is expected from the sign

the primary factors in the default of financial institutions. Systemic risk
results from correlations between individual default probabilities that cannot

we discuss a model in which these correlations arise from overlaps in banks'
portfolios. Portfolio diversification is used as a strategy to mitigate losses
from investments in risky projects. We calculate an optimal level of
diversification that has to be reached for a given level of excessive leverage
to still mitigate an increase in systemic risk. In our model, this optimal
diversification further depends on the market size and the market conditions
(e.g. volatility). It allows to distinguish between a safe regime, in which
excessive leverage does not result in an increase of systemic risk, and a risky

sufficiently large exchange interaction $J>\Delta$ compared to the

large/small $J/\Delta$ and large/small $S$ -- and numerically in between. In
sharp contrast to the classical case, the quantum solution features very rich
$S$-dependent multiscale dynamics. For any finite $S$, there is no
synchronization but a crossover around $J=\Delta$ between two regimes. The
synchronization transition is only recovered when $S\to \infty$, approaching

topology change, in the context of Gravity's Rainbow. A semi-classical approach
is adopted, where the graviton one-loop contribution to a classical energy in a
background spacetime is computed through a variational approach with Gaussian
trial wave functionals. The energy density of the graviton one-loop
contribution, or equivalently the background spacetime, is then let to evolve,
and consequently the classical energy is determined. More specifically, the
background metric is fixed to be Minkowskian in the equation governing the
quantum fluctuations, which behaves essentially as a backreaction equation, and
the quantum fluctuations are let to evolve; the classical energy, which depends
on the evolved metric functions, is then evaluated. Analysing this procedure, a
natural ultraviolet (UV) cutoff is obtained, which forbids the presence of an
interior spacetime region, and may result in a multipy-connected spacetime.
Thus, in the context of Gravity's Rainbow, this process may be interpreted as a
change in topology, and in principle results in the presence of a Planckian
wormhole.

asymptotic bounds for the error with the help of energy estimates. The
continuum model predicts the development of shock waves, which are also studied

existing results concerning the Nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) and Korteweg
de-Vries (KdV) approximation of FPU models apply directly to a precompressed

variants (SNV), which are relatively easy to detect and can be described with
rich mathematical models. However, it has been observed that genomes are highly
plastic, and that whole regions can be moved, removed or duplicated in bulk.
These structural variants (SV) have been shown to have significant impact on
the phenotype, but their study has been held back by the combinatorial

function of the local coherence vector of the subsystem $B$), has rank no
larger than $m-1$. Using the general Schatten $p$-norms, we quantify quantum
correlation by measuring any violation of this condition. The required
minimization can be carried out for the general $p$-norms and any function of
the local coherence vector of the unmeasured subsystem, leading to a class of
computable quantities which can be used to capture the quantumness of
correlations due to the subsystem $A$. We introduce two special members of
these quantifiers; The first one coincides with the tight lower bound on the
geometric measure of discord, so that such lower bound fully captures the
quantum correlation of a bipartite system. Accordingly, a vanishing tight lower
bound on the geometric discord is a necessary and sufficient condition for a
state to be zero-discord. The second quantifier has the property that it is
invariant under a local and reversible operation performed on the unmeasured
subsystem, so that it can be regarded as a computable well-defined measure of
the quantum correlations. The approach presented in this paper provides a way
to circumvent the problem with the geometric discord. We provide some examples
to exemplify this measure.

obtained with RXTE, SWIFT, Chandra, and XMM-Newton observations, from the
discovery of the source in June 2009, up to August 2012. The timing analysis
allowed us to obtain the first measurement of the period derivative of SGR
0418+5729: \dot{P}=4(1)x10^{-15} s/s, significant at ~3.5 sigma confidence
level. This leads to a surface dipolar magnetic field of B_dip ~6x 10^{12} G.
This measurement confirms SGR 0418+5729 as the lowest magnetic field magnetar.
Following the flux and spectral evolution from the beginning of the outburst up
to ~1200 days, we observe a gradual cooling of the tiny hot spot responsible
for the X-ray emission, from a temperature of ~0.9 to 0.3 keV. Simultaneously,
the X-ray flux decreased by about 3 orders of magnitude: from about
1.4x10^{-11} to 1.2x10^{-14} erg/s/cm^2 . Deep radio, millimeter, optical and
gamma-ray observations did not detect the source counterpart, implying
stringent limits on its multi-band emission, as well as constraints on the
presence of a fossil disk. By modeling the magneto-thermal secular evolution of
SGR 0418+5729, we infer a realistic age of ~550 kyr, and a dipolar magnetic
field at birth of ~10^{14} G. The outburst characteristics suggest the presence
of a thin twisted bundle with a small heated spot at its base. The bundle
untwisted in the first few months following the outburst, while the hot spot
decreases in temperature and size. We estimate the outburst rate of low
magnetic field magnetars to be about one per year per galaxy, and we briefly
discuss the consequences of such result in several other astrophysical
contexts.

para-ferrimagnetic phase transitions observed in layered uranium compounds,
UAs_{1-x}Se_x, UPd_2Si_2 or UNi_2Si_2. The above-mentioned systems are made of
ferromagnetic layers and the spins from the nearest-neighbor and
next-nearest-neighbor layers are coupled by the antiferromagnetic interactions
J_1<0 and J_2<0, respectively. Each of these systems exhibits a triple point in
which two ordered phases (ferrimagnetic and incommensurate) meet the
paramagnetic one, and all undergo the high field phase transition from para- to
ferrimagnetic (++-) phase. However, if in UAs_{1-x}Se_x the para-ferri phase
transition is of the first order as expected from the symmetry reason, in
UT_2Si_2 (T=Pd,Ni) this transition seems to be a continuous one, at least in
the vicinity of the multicritical point. Within the MFA, the critical character
of the finite field para-ferrimagnetic transition at least at one isolated
point can be described by the ANNNI model supplemented by an additional, e.g.,
four-spin interaction. However, in LPRG approximation for the ratio
\kappa=J_2/J_1 around 0.5 there is a critical value of the field for which an
isolated critical point also exists in the original ANNNI model. The positive
four-spin interaction shifts the critical point towards higher fields and
changes the shape of the specific heat curve. In the latter case for the fields
small enough, the specific heat exhibits two-peak structure in the paramagnetic

We adopt a simple star formation law where \Sigma_SFR \propto \Sigma_H2 (2) We

radial gas inflows in disks using a model of the form v_inflow = \alpha r. The
models are used to study the radial profiles of star formation rate and
gas-phase metallicity in present-day galaxies. The \Sigma_H2 profiles in L*
galaxies place strong constraints on inflow velocities, favouring models where
v_inflow~7km/s at a galactocentric radius of 10kpc. Radial gas inflow has
little influence on gas-phase and stellar metallicity gradients, which are
affected much more strongly by the fraction of metals that are directly
injected into the halo gas, rather than mixed with the cold gas. Metals ejected
out of the galaxy in early epochs result in late infall of pre-enriched gas and
flatter present-day gas-phase metallicity gradients. A prescription in which
80% of the metals are injected into the halo gas results in good fits to the
flat observed metallicity gradients in galaxies with stellar masses greater
than 10^10 M_sun, as well as the relations between gas-phase metallicity and
sSFR in the outer parts of galactic disks. We examine the correlation between
gas-phase metallicity gradient and global galaxy properties, finding that it is
most strongly correlated with the bulge-to-total ratio of the galaxy. This is
because gas is consumed when the bulge forms during galaxy mergers, and the
gas-phase metallicity gradient is then set by newly-accreted gas.

changes in the state. It is developed by modeling process noise using the
Student's t distribution, and the resulting smoother can track sudden changes
in the state.
  These features can be used separately or in tandem, and we present a general
smoother algorithm and open source implementation, together with convergence
analysis that covers a wide range of smoothers. A key ingredient of our
approach is a technique to deal with the non-convexity of the Student's t loss
function. Numerical results for linear and nonlinear models illustrate the
performance of the new smoothers for robust and tracking applications, as well
as for mixed problems that have both types of features.

the magnetic transition is accompanied by an orthorhombic distortion within the

domain orientation can be influenced either by applying uniaxial pressure or a
magnetic field along the [100] direction. In addition, our data reveal a
pronounced in-plane magnetic anisotropy for fields applied within the $ab$

for magnetic fields applied along [100], T$_N$ vanishes at about 10 T and the

only in a couple of PNe, their abundances are consistent with the standard
models, in which 3He is produced in significant quantities by stars of
1-2M_sun. However, for all the other PNe observed to date there have been no
detections, therefore only upper limits in their abundance can be calculated.
Observations of the 3He+ emission line using the VLA towards the PNe IC 418,
NGC 6572 and NGC 7009 were used to obtain upper limits for their 3He abundance.
Because the abundance of 3He in HII regions, the ISM and the proto-solar system

resulting evolution of 3He, based on stellar evolution models, can be
consistent with the values determined in pre-solar material and the ISM if 96

enhanced 3He depletion. This implies that unless the combined sample of PNe

based on the Bel-Robinson tensor, which has a natural interpretation as the
effective super-energy-momentum tensor of free gravitational fields. The
specific form of this measure differs depending on whether the gravitational
field is Coulomb-like or wave-like, and reduces to the Bekenstein-Hawking value
when integrated over the interior of a Schwarzschild black hole. For scalar
perturbations of a Robertson-Walker geometry we find that the entropy goes like
the Hubble weighted anisotropy of the gravitational field, and therefore
increases as structure formation occurs. This is in keeping with our
expectations for the behaviour of gravitational entropy in cosmology, and
provides a thermodynamically motivated arrow of time for cosmological solutions
of Einstein's field equations. It is also in keeping with Penrose's Weyl
curvature hypothesis.

research in which data can be represented as a graph of entities and
relationships. Oftentimes the object of interest is a relatively small subgraph

network detection as a ""big data"" problem. Graph partitioning and network
discovery have been major research areas over the last ten years, driven by
interest in internet search, cyber security, social networks, and criminal or
terrorist activities. The specific problem of network discovery is addressed as
a special case of graph partitioning in which membership in a small subgraph of
interest must be determined. Algebraic graph theory is used as the basis to
analyze and compare different network detection methods. A new Bayesian network
detection framework is introduced that partitions the graph based on prior
information and direct observations. The new approach, called space-time threat
propagation, is proved to maximize the probability of detection and is
therefore optimum in the Neyman-Pearson sense. This optimality criterion is
compared to spectral community detection approaches which divide the global
graph into subsets or communities with optimal connectivity properties. We also
explore a new generative stochastic model for covert networks and analyze using
receiver operating characteristics the detection performance of both classes of
optimal detection techniques.

disease extinction as the ultimate goal. Although diseases may go extinct due
to random loss of effective contacts where the infection is transmitted to new
susceptible individuals, the time to extinction in the absence of control may
be prohibitively long. Thus intervention controls, such as vaccination of
susceptible individuals and/or treatment of infectives, are typically based on
a deterministic schedule, such as periodically vaccinating susceptible children
based on school calendars. In reality, however, such policies are administered
as a random process, while still possessing a mean period. Here, we consider
the effect of randomly distributed intervention as disease control on large
finite populations. We show explicitly how intervention control, based on mean
period and treatment fraction, modulates the average extinction times as a
function of population size and rate of infection spread. In particular, our
results show an exponential improvement in extinction times even though the
controls are implemented using a random Poisson distribution. Finally, we
discover those parameter regimes where random treatment yields an exponential
improvement in extinction times over the application of strictly periodic
intervention. The implication of our results is discussed in light of the
availability of limited resources for control.

survey recent efforts towards this goal. I will then describe a set of methods

At the core of this toolbox are sequential sampling models which have been used
to explain diverse cognitive neuroscience phenomena but have so far seen little
adoption in psychiatric research. I will then describe how these models can be

$\pi$ is {\it potentially $H$-graphic} if there is a realization of $\pi$ that
contains $H$ as a subgraph.
  Given nonincreasing graphic sequences $\pi_1=(d_1,\ldots,d_n)$ and $\pi_2 =
(s_1,\ldots,s_n)$, we say that $\pi_1$ {\it majorizes} $\pi_2$ if $d_i \geq
s_i$ for all $i$, $1 \leq i \leq n$. In 1970, Erd\H{o}s showed that for any
$K_{r+1}$-free graph $H$, there exists an $r$-partite graph $G$ such that
$\pi(G)$ majorizes $\pi(H)$. In 2005, Pikhurko and Taraz generalized this
notion and showed that for any graph $F$ with chromatic number $r+1$, the
degree sequence of an $F$-free graph is, in an appropriate sense, nearly
majorized by the degree sequence of an $r$-partite graph.
  In this paper, we give similar results for degree sequences that are not

such that if $\pi$ is a graphic sequence that is not potentially $H$-graphic,
then $\pi$ is close to being majorized by $\pi^*(H)$. Similar to the role
played by complete multipartite graphs in the traditional extremal setting, the

through radio observations of the redshifted 21-cm line emission from neutral
hydrogen. These observations are complicated by the fact that the mapping of
redshifts to line-of-sight positions is distorted by the peculiar velocities of
the gas. Such distortions can be a source of error if they are not properly
understood, but they also encode information about cosmology and astrophysics.
We study the effects of redshift space distortions on the power spectrum of
21-cm radiation from the EoR using large scale $N$-body and radiative transfer
simulations. We quantify the anisotropy introduced in the 21-cm power spectrum
by redshift space distortions and show how it evolves as reionization
progresses and how it relates to the underlying physics. We go on to study the
effects of redshift space distortions on LOFAR observations, taking instrument
noise and foreground subtraction into account. We find that LOFAR should be
able to directly observe the power spectrum anisotropy due to redshift space
distortions at spatial scales around $k \sim 0.1$ Mpc$^{-1}$ after $\gtrsim$
1000 hours of integration time. At larger scales, sample errors become a
limiting factor, while at smaller scales detector noise and foregrounds make
the extraction of the signal problematic. Finally, we show how the
astrophysical information contained in the evolution of the anisotropy of the
21-cm power spectrum can be extracted from LOFAR observations, and how it can
be used to distinguish between different reionization scenarios.

trade-offs between the size of the system and the completeness of the model. We
study quantum heat transfer in a self-consistent thermal bath setup consisting
of two lead regions connected by a center region. Atoms both in the leads and
in the center region are coupled to quantum Langevin heat baths that mimic the
damping and dephasing of phonon waves by anharmonic scattering. This approach
treats the leads and the center region on same footing and thereby allows for a
simple and physically transparent thermalization of the system, enabling also
perfect acoustic matching between the leads and the center region. Increasing
the strength of the coupling reduces the mean free path of phonons and
gradually shifts phonon transport from ballistic regime to diffusive regime. In
the center region, the bath temperatures are determined self-consistently from
the requirement of zero net energy exchange between the local heat bath and
each atom. By solving the stochastic equations of motion in frequency space and
averaging over noise using the general fluctuation-dissipation relation derived

sets for Lebesgue's measure on R as well as the existence of ""paradoxical""
decompositions of the unit ball of R^3 (Banach-Tarski). This is generally
interpreted as the price to be paid for the numerous services provided by this
axiom. The theory proposed by Olivier Leroy shows that we can have
simultaneously axiom of choice and "" everything is measurable "" it takes place
within the framework of ""locales"" which are particular cases of Grothendieck's
toposes : a ""locale"" is just a poset which has the formal properties of the
poset of open subsets of a topological space. ""Locales"" have already been the
object of numerous studies (cf for example ""Sheaves in Geometry and Logic"" of
S.Mac Lane and I.Moerdijk. Springer 92.). One of the remarkable aspects of this
theory is that it applies in a relevant way to the usual topological spaces in
which it shows up "" non standard sub-spaces "" (sub-locales)); with for
consequence that the intersection (in the meaning of locale) of ordinary
sub-spaces is not anymore necessarily a (ordinary) sub-space. We have for
example a sub-locale of R (called generic sub-locale of R) which is the
intersection of dense open sets and which is still dense (although pointless).
The most striking result is doubtless that the natural continuation of the
measure of Lebesgue (on [0,1] for example) on the open sets to the totality of
sub-locales of [0,1] is a sigma additive outside regular measure The
""paradoxical "" partitions which gave non-measurable subsets in the classical
context are no more partitions in the context of locales. There are hidden
intersections.... Jean-Malgoire et Christine Voisin

between Fresnel images and simulations based on the modified London equation to
investigate the magnetic structure of flux vortices in MgB2. This technique
gives an absolute, low-field (~30 Oe) measurement of the penetration depth from
images of single vortices. We found that these simulations gave a good fit to
the experimental images and that if all the other parameters in the fit were
known, the penetration depth for individual vortices could be measured with an
accuracy of +/- 5 nm. Averaging over 17 vortices gave a penetration depth in
the ab plane of 113 +/- 2 at 10.8 K assuming that the entire thickness of the
sample was superconducting. The main uncertainty in this measurement was the
proportion of the specimen which was superconducting. Allowing for a
non-superconducting layer of up to 50 nm thickness on the specimen surfaces
gave a penetration depth in the range 100-115 nm, close to values of 90 +/- 2
nm obtained by small-angle neutron scattering and 118-138 nm obtained by

The underlying reduced configuration spaces are $\mathbb{CP}^2$ and the cone

potential cases and perturbations about these. Moreover, our purely relational
kinematical quantization is distinct from the usual one for $\mathbb{CP}^2$,
which turns out to carry absolutist connotations instead. Thus this paper is
the first to note absolute-versus-relational motion distinctions at the
kinematical rather than dynamical level, and also an example of value to the
discussion of kinematical quantization along the lines of Isham 1984. This
treatment of the relational quadrilateral is the first relational QM with very
new mathematics for a finite QM model, and is far more typical of the general
quantum relational $N$-a-gon than the previously-studied case of the relational
triangle. We consider useful integrals as regards perturbation theory and the
peaking interpretation of quantum cosmology. We subsequently consider problem
of time applications of this: quantum Kucha\v{r} beables, the Machian version
of the semiclassical approach and the timeless naive Schrodinger
interpretation. These go toward extending the combined Machian
semiclassical-histories-timeless approach of [1] to the case of the

given during the workshop and conference 'Groups and Geometries', held at the
Indian Statistical Institute in Bangalore in December 2012. The aim of this
paper is to give an overview of the theory of polar spaces focusing on some
research topics related to polar spaces. We survey the fundamental results
about polar spaces starting from classical polar spaces. Then we introduce and
report on the state of the art on the following research topics: polar spaces
of infinite rank, embedding polar spaces in groups and projective embeddings of
dual polar spaces.

  classical probability theory and special relativity","30 pages, 2 figures; thoroughly rewritten text",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  After the review by Hauge and Stovneng the old question of ""How long does it
take to tunnel through the barrier?"" has not still lost its relevance. As
before, there is no clear answer to this question even for the one-dimensional
completed scattering (OCS). In this paper we show that this seemingly simple
question stands alongside with such fundamental problems of quantum mechanics
(QM) as the Schrodinger's-cat and and EPR-Bohm paradoxes. Their common feature
is that the states of a scattered particle, a radioactive atom and electron
EPR-pair represent pure {\it micro-cat} states. It is widely accepted that the
EPR-Bohm paradox implies the non-existence of local hidden variables (LHVs),
the cat paradox represents a macro-objectification problem and the tunneling
time is an observer-dependent quantity whose definitions must be 'operational'.
At the same time, according to the probabilistic approach (Accardi, Khrennikov,
Philipp, Hess {\it et al.}) to Bell's inequality that underlies the EPR-Bohm
experiments, its experimental violation means simply that it contains
probability distributions associated with mutually incompatible statistical
data. We argue that this approach must be extended onto micro-cat states
because they describe, too, mutually incompatible statistical data. The current
practice to interpret the squared modulus of a micro-cat state as the
probability density should be recognized as erroneous. It is this practice that
makes QM incompatible with classical physical theories and, thereby, makes the
micro-world 'unspeakable'. The known 'operational' tunneling-time concepts,
elaborated in line with this practice, are logically inconsistent. We argue
that the TTP and the cat paradox must be solved at the level of single
electrons and atoms, without resorting to environment and measurement contexts.
We present a new model of the OCS and solve the TTP on its basis.

carbon-based structures was fulfilled to elucidate and resolve (at least
partially) some unclear issues. It was the purpose of the present paper to look
somewhat more critically into some conjectures which have been made and to the
peculiar and contradictory experimental results in this rather indistinct and
disputable field. Firstly the basic physics of magnetism was briefly addressed.
Then a few basic questions were thoroughly analyzed and critically reconsidered
to elucidate the possible relevant mechanism (if any) which may be responsible
for observed peculiarities of the ""magnetic"" behavior in these systems. The
arguments supporting the existence of the intrinsic magnetism in carbon-based
materials, including pure graphene were analyzed critically. It was concluded
that recently published works have shown clearly that the results of the
previous studies, where the ""ferromagnetism"" was detected in pure graphene,
were incorrect. Rather, graphene is strongly diamagnetic, similar to graphite.
Thus the possible traces of a quasi-magnetic behavior which some authors
observed in their samples may be attributed rather to induced magnetism due to
the impurities, defects, etc. On the basis of the present analysis the
conclusion was made that the thorough and detailed experimental studies of
these problems only may shed light on the very complicated problem of the
magnetism of carbon-based materials. Lastly the peculiarities of the magnetic
behavior of some related materials and the trends for future developments were
mentioned.

described by phase transitions. Despite the similarity with percolation
transitions, whether an epidemic outbreak occurs or not cannot be predicted
with probability one in the thermodynamic limit. We elucidate its mechanism by
deriving a simple Langevin equation that captures an essential aspect of the
phenomenon. We also calculate the probability of epidemic outbreaks near the

spectrometer (RGS) onboard XMM-Newton, we reveal dynamics of X-ray--emitting
ejecta in the oxygen-rich supernova remnant Puppis A. The RGS spectrum shows
prominent K-shell lines, including O VII He_alpha forbidden and resonance, O
VIII Ly_alpha, O VIII Ly_beta, and Ne IX He_alpha resonance, from an ejecta
knot positionally coincident with an optical oxygen-rich filament (the
so-called Omega filament in the northeast of the remnant). We find that the
line centroids are blueshifted by 1480+/-140+/-60 km/s (the first and second
term errors are measurement and calibration uncertainties, respectively), which
is fully consistent with that of the optical Omega filament. Line broadening at
654 eV (corresponding to O VIII Ly_alpha) is obtained to be less than ~0.9 eV,
indicating an oxygen temperature of less than ~30 keV. Analysis of XMM-Newton
MOS spectra shows an electron temperature of ~0.8 keV and an ionization
timescale of ~2e10 cm^-3 s. We show that the oxygen and electron temperatures
as well as the ionization timescale can be reconciled if the ejecta knot was
heated by a collisionless shock whose velocity is ~600-1200 km/s and was
subsequently equilibrated due to Coulomb interactions. The RGS spectrum also
shows relatively weak K-shell lines of another ejecta feature located near the
northeastern edge of the remnant, from which we measure redward Doppler
velocities of 650+/-70+/-60 km/s.

Newton-Wigner position operator), the spatial density can be arbitrarily narrow
and its time-evolution is superluminal for short time intervals. Furthermore,
two spatially distant particles might be able to interact with each other
outside the light cone, which is manifested by an asymmetric spreading of the
spatial density. The second yardstick (defined by the quantum field operator)
does not permit localized states and the time evolution is subluminal.

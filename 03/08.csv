planets is found to vary from 0.4 to about 1.0. This has led to discussions
about the existence of terrestrial planets with a carbon-dominated composition
that is very different from the composition of the Earth. The C/O values were
obtained by determining carbon abundances from high-excitation CI lines and
oxygen abundances from the forbidden [OI] line at 6300 A. This weak line is,
however, strongly affected by a nickel blend at high metallicities. Aiming for
more precise C/O ratios, oxygen abundances in this paper are derived from the
high-excitation OI triplet at 7774 A and carbon abundances from the CI lines at
5052 and 5380 A using MARCS model atmospheres and including non-LTE
corrections. The results do not confirm the high C/O ratios previously found.
C/O shows a tight, slightly increasing dependence on metallicity from C/O=0.58
at [Fe/H]=0.0 to C/O=0.70 at [Fe/H] =0.4 with an rms scatter of only 0.06.
Assuming that the composition of a proto-planetary disk is the same as that of
the host star, the C/O values found in this paper lend no support to the
existence of carbon-rich planets. The small scatter of C/O among thin-disk
stars suggests that the nucleosynthesis products of Type II supernovae and low-
to intermediate-mass stars are well mixed in the interstellar medium.

need an energy source to stabilize dark matter halos in spiral galaxies. It has
been suggested previously that ordinary supernovae can potentially supply the
required energy. By matching the energy supplied to the halo from supernovae to
that lost due to radiative cooling, we here derive a rough scaling relation,
$R_{SN} \propto \rho_0 r_0^2$ ($R_{SN}$ is the supernova rate and $\rho_0, \
r_0$ the dark matter central density and core radius). Such a relation is
consistent with dark matter properties inferred from studies of spiral galaxies
with halo masses larger than $3\times 10^{11} M_\odot$. We speculate that other
observed galaxy regularities might be explained within the framework of such
dissipative dark matter.

human nature demands more comfort to his life. The man seeks ways to do things
easily and which saves time. So thus, the automatic gates are one of the
examples that human nature invent to bring comfort and ease in its daily life.
To this end, we model and design an automatic sliding door with a room light
control system to provide the mentioned needs. This was achieved by considering
some factors such as economy, availability of components and research
materials, efficiency, compatibility and portability and also durability in the
design process. The performance of the system after test met design
specifications. This system works on the principle of breaking an infrared beam
of light, sensed by a photodiode. It consists of two transmitting infrared
diodes and two receiving photo-diodes. The first one is for someone coming in
and the second one is for someone going out of the room. The photodiodes are
connected to comparators, which give a lower output when the beam is broken and
high output when transmitting normally. The general operation of the work and
performance is dependent on the presence of an intruder entering through the
door and how close he/she is in closer to the door. The door is meant to open
automatically but in a case where there is no power supply trying to force the
door open would damage the mechanical control system of the unit. The overall
work was implemented with a constructed work, tested working and perfectly
functional.

  and extension to non-proportional loading",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The two-phase composite approach of Estrin et al. (1998) describes an
evolving dislocation cell structure. Mckenzie et al. (2007) enhanced the model
to capture the effects of hydrostatic pressure and temperature during severe
plastic deformation. The goal of the present study is to incorporate this
microstructural model into the macroscopic viscoplasticity framework proposed
by Shutov and Krei\ss ig (2008a). Thereby, the two-phase composite approach is
examined carefully. Both physical and numerical drawbacks are revealed and
possible solutions are presented, thus leading to a refined micro model.
Moreover, some improvements concerning reliable parameter identification are
suggested as well. The material parameters of the refined micro model are
identified for an aluminum alloy using TEM cell size measurements. Then, an
extension to non-proportional deformation is performed in such a way that the
evolution of dislocation densities becomes sensitive to load path changes.
Experimental findings suggest that such deformation modes can significantly
influence the evolution of microstructure, including the dissolution of cells
and the reduction of total dislocation density shortly after the load path
change. In order to capture such effects, some tensor-valued state variables
are introduced which couple the refined micro model with the macroscopic
viscoplasticity model. As a result, a new system of constitutive equations is
obtained. In order to demonstrate its capability to respond to load path
changes, load cases as typical for Equal Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP) are
considered. The obtained evolution of dislocation populations differs
signficantly depending on which ECAP route is applied.

area of interest (monitored area), and this further reacts to a change in the
reflected energy pattern. The system uses a technique that is based on a
frequency shift in reflected energy to detect a movement or change in position
(motion). In this system, ultrasonic sound is transmitted from the transmitting
device which is normally in the form of energy. The transmitted sound utilizes
air as its medium and this travel in a wave type motion. The wave is reflected
back from the surroundings in the room/hallway and the device hears a pitch
characteristic of the protected environment. In this system, the wave pattern
is disturbed and reflected back more quickly, thus increasing the pitch and
signaling an alarm whenever motion is detected. The main contribution of this
work is the design of a circuit that can sense motion through movement of
anything, a low cost and portable motion detector, and the design of a circuit
that can be used to trigger another circuit whether to ON or OFF depending on
the circuit attached to it. Generally, the design is made to detect movement or
moving object in a an enclosed area. In this work, a transmitter transducer
generates a signal at a frequency of 40khz, and when the signal is blocked by
any moving object, and this in turn, triggers a buzzer via a timing circuit.

and the system is dependent on the presence of an intruder or moving object

types of relationships among a set of objects, which we represent by a sparse

do so, we model each relationship as a function of a linear combination of
latent factors. We learn this latent representation by computing a low-rank
tensor decomposition, using quasi-Newton optimization of a weighted objective
function. Sparsity in the observed data is captured by the weighted objective,
leading to improved accuracy when training data is limited. Exploiting sparsity
also improves efficiency, potentially up to an order of magnitude over
unweighted approaches. In addition, our framework accommodates arbitrary
combinations of smooth, task-specific loss functions, making it better suited
for learning different types of relations. For the typical cases of real-valued
functions and binary relations, we propose several loss functions and derive
the associated parameter gradients. We evaluate our method on synthetic and

approaches to clustering complex networks are based on the idea of maximizing a

global because they exploit knowledge about the whole network topology to find
clusters. Other approaches, instead, can be interpreted as local because they
require only a partial knowledge of the network topology, e.g., the neighbors
of a vertex. Global approaches are able to achieve high values of modularity
but they do not scale well on large networks and, therefore, they cannot be
applied to analyze on-line social networks like Facebook or YouTube. In
contrast, local approaches are fast and scale up to large, real-life networks,
at the cost of poorer results than those achieved by local methods. In this
article we propose a glocal method to maximizing modularity, i.e., our method
uses information at the global level, yet its scalability on large networks is
comparable to that of local methods. The proposed method is called COmplex
Network CLUster DEtection (or, shortly, CONCLUDE.) It works in two stages: in
the first stage it uses an information-propagation model, based on random and
non-backtracking walks of finite length, to compute the importance of each edge
in keeping the network connected (called edge centrality.) Then, edge
centrality is used to map network vertices onto points of an Euclidean space
and to compute distances between all pairs of connected vertices. In the second
stage, CONCLUDE uses the distances computed in the first stage to partition the
network into clusters. CONCLUDE is computationally efficient since in the
average case its cost is roughly linear in the number of edges of the network.

  In this article we propose a strategy to enhance existing community detection

Our strategy is able to effectively complements information about network

multiple random walks of bounded length on the network. Our method makes the
computation of edge centralities feasible also on large-scale networks. It has
been tested in conjunction with three state-of-the-art community detection

brightness decompositions of the host galaxies of 9 new AGNs imaged with the

decompositions allow us to create ""AGN-free"" images of the galaxies, from which
we measure the starlight contribution to the optical luminosity measured
through the ground-based spectroscopic aperture. We also incorporate 20 new
reverberation-mapping measurements of the Hbeta time lag, which is assumed to
yield the average Hbeta BLR radius. The final sample includes 41 AGNs covering
four orders of magnitude in luminosity. The additions and updates incorporated
here primarily affect the low-luminosity end of the R-L relationship. The best
fit to the relationship using a Bayesian analysis finds a slope of alpha =
0.533 (+0.035/-0.033), consistent with previous work and with simple
photoionization arguments. Only two AGNs appear to be outliers from the
relationship, but both of them have monitoring light curves that raise doubt
regarding the accuracy of their reported time lags. The scatter around the
relationship is found to be 0.19(+/-0.02) dex, but would be decreased to 0.13
dex by the removal of these two suspect measurements. A large fraction of the
remaining scatter in the relationship is likely due to the inaccurate distances
to the AGN host galaxies. Our results help support the possibility that the R-L
relationship could potentially be used to turn the BLRs of AGNs into
standardizable candles. This would allow the cosmological expansion of the
Universe to be probed by a separate population of objects, and over a larger
range of redshifts.

fault isolation, effective bandwidth utilization, a superior adaptation to the
underlying physical network and a reduction of the lookup path length as
additional advantages. It is more efficient and easier to manage than
traditional p2p networks. This paper discusses a further step in p2p hierarchy
via 3-layers hierarchical model with distributed database architecture in
different layer, each of which is connected through its root. The peers are
divided into three categories according to their physical stability and
strength. They are Ultra Super-peer, Super-peer and Ordinary Peer and we assign
these peers to first, second and third level of hierarchy respectively. Peers
in a group in lower layer have their own local database which hold as
associated super-peer in middle layer and access the database among the peers
through user queries. In our 3-layer hierarchical model for DHT algorithms, we
used an advanced Chord algorithm with optimized finger table which can remove
the redundant entry in the finger table in upper layer that influences the
system to reduce the lookup latency. Our research work finally resulted that
our model really provides faster search since the network lookup latency is
decreased by reducing the number of hops. The peers in such network then can
contribute with improve functionality and can perform well in P2P networks.

Bennett-Brassard 1984 protocol, in order to produce a larger secret key. This
protocol was proposed by Luo and Devetak, but codes leading to good performance
have not been investigated. We look into a family of EAQECCs generated by
classical finite geometry (FG) low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, for which
very efficient iterative decoders exist. A critical observation is that almost
all errors in the resulting secret key result from uncorrectable block errors
that can be detected by an additional syndrome check and an additional sampling
step. Bad blocks can then be discarded. We make some changes to the original
protocol to avoid the consumption of the preshared key when the protocol fails.
This allows us to greatly reduce the bit error rate of the key at the cost of a
minor reduction in the key production rate, but without increasing the
consumption rate of the preshared key. We present numerical simulations for the

cosmology and particle physics nowadays. While in the typical models the dark

more natural scenario would include a whole set of gauge interactions which are
invisible for the standard model but that are in contact with the dark matter.
We present a method to constrain the number of massless gauge bosons and other
relativistic particles that might be present in the dark sector using current
and future cosmic microwave background data, and provide upper bounds on the
size of the dark sector. We use the fact that the dark matter abundance depends
on the strength of the interactions with both sectors, which allows one to
relate the freeze-out temperature of the dark matter with the temperature of
{this cosmic background of dark gauge bosons}. This relation can then be used
to calculate how sizable is the impact of the relativistic dark sector in the
number of degrees of freedom of the early Universe, providing an interesting
and testable connection between cosmological data and direct/indirect detection
experiments. The recent Planck data, in combination with other cosmic microwave
background experiments and baryonic acoustic oscillations data, constrains the
number of relativistic dark gauge bosons, when the freeze-out temperature of
the dark matter is larger than the top mass, to be N \lesssim 14 for the

evolution of off-axis nematic elastomer ribbons as a function of temperature.
The elastomers are prepared by cross-linking the mesogens with planar anchoring
of the director at top and bottom surfaces with a 90 degree left-handed twist.
Shape evolution depends sensitively on the off-axis director orientation at the
sample mid-plane. When the director at midplane is parallel to either the
ribbon's long or short axes, ribbons form either helicoids or spirals depending
on the aspect ratio and temperature. If the director at midplane is more than 5
degrees off-axis, then they form only spiral ribbons. Samples in all these
geometries show a remarkable transition from right- to left-handed chiral
shapes on change of temperature. Simulation studies provide insight into the
mechanisms driving shape evolution and enable engineering design of these
materials for future applications.

fractional quantum Hall states on lattices, are proposed when a Chern band is
partially filled. Some trial wavefunctions of fractional Chern insulators can
be obtained by mapping the fractional quantum Hall wavefunctions defined in the
continuum onto the lattice through the Wannier state representation (Phys. Rev.
Lett. 107, 126803 (2011)) in which the single particle Landau orbits in the
Landau levels are identified with the one dimensional Wannier states of the
Chern bands with Chern number C = 1. However, this mapping generically breaks
the lattice point group symmetry. In this paper, we discuss a general approach
of modifying the mapping to accommodate the lattice rotational symmetry. The
wavefunctions constructed through this modified mapping should serve as better
trial wavefunctions to compare with the numerics and also as the basis for
construction of lattice symmetry preserving pseudo-potential formalism for
fractional Chern insulators. The focus of this paper shall be mainly on the
$C_4$ rotational symmetry of square lattices. Similar analysis can be
straightforwardly generalized to triangular or hexagonal lattices with $C_6$
symmetry. We also generalize the discussion to the lattice symmetry of
fractional Chern insulators with high Chern number bands.

response is an ultimate goal of personalized medicine. Although genome-wide
association studies have discovered thousands of well-replicated polymorphisms
associated with a broad spectrum of complex traits, the combined predictive
power of these associations for any given trait is generally too low to be of
clinical relevance. We propose a novel systems approach to complex trait
prediction, which leverages and integrates similarity in genetic,
transcriptomic or other omics-level data. We translate the omic similarity into
phenotypic similarity using a method called Kriging, commonly used in
geostatistics and machine learning. Our method called OmicKriging emphasizes
the use of a wide variety of systems-level data, such as those increasingly
made available by comprehensive surveys of the genome, transcriptome and
epigenome, for complex trait prediction. Furthermore, our OmicKriging framework
allows easy integration of prior information on the function of subsets of
omics-level data from heterogeneous sources without the sometimes heavy
computational burden of Bayesian approaches. Using seven disease datasets from
the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC), we show that OmicKriging
allows simple integration of sparse and highly polygenic components yielding
comparable performance at a fraction of the computing time of a recently
published Bayesian sparse linear mixed model method. Using a cellular growth
phenotype, we show that integrating mRNA and microRNA expression data
substantially increases performance over either dataset alone. We also
integrate genotype and expression data to predict change in LDL cholesterol
levels after statin treatment and show that OmicKriging performs better than
the polygenic score method. We provide an R package to implement OmicKriging.

(unlike giants) the carbon abundance has not been affected by mixing with deep
layers and is therefore easier to interpret. The analysis was performed with 1D
LTE static model atmospheres. When available, non-LTE corrections were applied
to the classical LTE abundances. The 3D effects on the CH and CN molecular
bands were computed using hydrodynamical simulations of the stellar atmosphere

significantly lower carbon abundances, suggesting a lower plateau at A(C)

complement recent analyses by experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
involving central $p$$+$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$=5.02 TeV, which
have indicated strong anisotropic long-range correlations in angular
distributions of hadron pairs. The origin of these anisotropies is currently
unknown. Various competing explanations include parton saturation and
hydrodynamic flow. We observe qualitatively similar, but larger, anisotropies
in $d$$+$Au collisions compared to those seen in $p$$+$Pb collisions at the
LHC. The larger extracted $v_2$ values in $d$$+$Au collisions at RHIC are
consistent with expectations from hydrodynamic calculations owing to the larger
expected initial-state eccentricity compared with that from $p$$+$Pb
collisions. When both are divided by an estimate of the initial-state
eccentricity the scaled anisotropies follow a common trend with multiplicity
that may extend to heavy ion data at RHIC and the LHC, where the anisotropies
are widely thought to arise from hydrodynamic flow.

full-duplex systems can achieve larger rates than an equivalent half-duplex

self-interference signal, which is caused by a combination of hardware and
implementation imperfections. Thus, we first present a signal model which
captures the effect of significant impairments such as oscillator phase noise,
low-noise amplifier noise figure, mixer noise, and analog-to-digital converter
quantization noise. Using the detailed signal model, we study the rate gain
region, which is defined as the region of received signal-of-interest strength
where full-duplex systems outperform half-duplex systems in terms of achievable
rate. The rate gain region is derived as a piece-wise linear approximation in
log-domain, and numerical results show that the approximation closely matches
the exact region. Our analysis shows that when phase noise dominates mixer and
quantization noise, full-duplex systems can use either active analog
cancellation or base-band digital cancellation to achieve near-identical rate
gain regions. Finally, as a design example, we numerically investigate the
full-duplex system performance and rate gain region in typical indoor
environments for practical wireless applications.

information is available about its trajectory inside the atmosphere. A few
methods have been devised in the past and used in several cases to trace back
the origin of small impactors. On February 15, 2013, a medium-sized meteoroid
hit the atmosphere in the Chelyabinsk region of Russia, causing damage in
several large cities. The incident, the largest registered since the Tunguska
event, was witnessed by many thousands and recorded by hundreds of amateur and
public video recording systems. The amount and quality of the information
gathered by those systems is sufficient to attempt a reconstruction of the
trajectory of the impactor body in the atmosphere, and from this the orbit of
the body with respect to the Sun. Using amateur and public footage taken in
four different places close to the event, we have determined precisely the
properties of the entrance trajectory and the orbit of the Chelyabinsk event
impactor. We found that the object entered the atmosphere at a velocity ranging
from 16.0 to 17.4 km/s in a grazing trajectory, almost directly from the east,
with an azimuth of velocity vector of 285$^o$, and with an elevation of
15.8$^o$ with respect to the local horizon. The orbit that best fits the
observations has, at a 95% confidence level, a semi-major axis a =
1.26$\pm$0.05 AU, eccentricity e = 0.44$\pm$0.03, argument of perihelion
$\omega$=95.5$^o\pm2^o$ and longitude of ascending node $\Omega$=
326.5$^o\pm0.3^o$. Using these properties the object can be classified as
belonging to the Apollo family of asteroids. The absolute magnitude of the
meteoroid was H= 25.8, well below the threshold for its detection and
identification as a Potential Hazardous Asteroid (PHA). This result would imply
that present efforts intended to detect and characterize PHAs are incomplete.

argue that, in d space-time dimensions, the gauge anomalies are described by
the elements in Free[H^{d+1}(G,R/Z)]\oplus H_\pi^{d+1}(BG,R/Z). The well known
Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomalies are classified by the free part of the group
cohomology class H^{d+1}(G,R/Z) of the gauge group G (denoted as
Free[H^{d+1}(G,\R/\Z)]). We refer other kinds of gauge anomalies beyond
Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomalies as nonABJ gauge anomalies, which include Witten
SU(2) global gauge anomaly. We introduce a notion of \pi-cohomology group,
H_\pi^{d+1}(BG,R/Z), for the classifying space BG, which is an Abelian group

H^{d+1}(BG,R/Z) as subgroups. We argue that H_\pi^{d+1}(BG,R/Z) classifies the
bosonic nonABJ gauge anomalies, and partially classifies fermionic nonABJ
anomalies. Using the same approach that shows gauge anomalies to be connected

Our study is the first attempt to quantitatively characterize the scientific
value of lensing maps, which could serve in the future as a complementary
approach to the study of the dark universe with gravitational lensing. We show
that mass maps contain unique cosmological information beyond that of
traditional two-points statistical analysis techniques. Using a series of
numerical simulations, we first show how, reproducing the CFHTLenS observing
conditions, gravitational lensing inversion provides a reliable estimate of the
projected matter distribution of large scale structure. We validate our
analysis by quantifying the robustness of the maps with various statistical
estimators. We then apply the same process to the CFHTLenS data. We find that
the 2-points correlation function of the projected mass is consistent with the
cosmological analysis performed on the shear correlation function discussed in
the CFHTLenS companion papers. The maps also lead to a significant measurement
of the third order moment of the projected mass, which is in agreement with
analytic predictions, and to a marginal detection of the fourth order moment.
Tests for residual systematics are found to be consistent with zero for the
statistical estimators we used. A new approach for the comparison of the
reconstructed mass map to that predicted from the galaxy distribution reveals
the existence of giant voids in the dark matter maps as large as 3 degrees on
the sky. Our analysis shows that lensing mass maps can be used for new
techniques such as peak statistics and the morphological analysis of the
projected dark matter distribution.

  Group","Accepted for publication in MNRAS, 8 pages, 3 figures",,"10.1093/mnras/stt435",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The recent discovery by Ibata et al. (2013) of a vast thin disk of satellites
(VTDS) around M31 offers a new challenge for the understanding of the Local
Group properties. This comes in addition to the unexpected proximity of the
Magellanic Clouds (MCs) to the Milky Way (MW), and to another vast polar
structure (VPOS), which is almost perpendicular to our Galaxy disk. We find
that the VTDS plane is coinciding with several stellar, tidally-induced streams
in the outskirts of M31, and, that its velocity distribution is consistent with
that of the Giant Stream (GS). This is suggestive of a common physical
mechanism, likely linked to merger tidal interactions, knowing that a similar
argument may apply to the VPOS at the MW location. Furthermore, the VTDS is
pointing towards the MW, being almost perpendicular to the MW disk, as the VPOS
is.
  We compare these properties to the modelling of M31 as an ancient, gas-rich
major merger, which has been successfully used to predict the M31 substructures
and the GS origin. We find that without fine tuning, the induced tidal tails
are lying in the VTDS plane, providing a single and common origin for many
stellar streams and for the vast stellar structures surrounding both the MW and
M31. The model also reproduces quite accurately positions and velocities of the
VTDS dSphs. Our conjecture leads to a novel interpretation of the Local Group
past history, as a gigantic tidal tail due to the M31 ancient merger is
expected to send material towards the MW, including the MCs. Such a link
between M31 and the MW is expected to be quite exceptional, though it may be in
qualitative agreement with the reported rareness of MW-MCs systems in nearby
galaxies.

PS1-12sk, a transient with properties that indicate atypical star formation in
its host galaxy cluster or pose a challenge to popular progenitor system models
for this class of explosion. The optical spectra of PS1-12sk classify it as a
Type Ibn SN (c.f. SN 2006jc), dominated by intermediate-width (3x10^3 km/s) and
time variable He I emission. Our multi-wavelength monitoring establishes the
rise time dt = 9-23 days and shows an NUV-NIR SED with temperature > 17x10^3 K
and a peak rise magnitude of Mz = -18.9 mag. SN Ibn spectroscopic properties
are commonly interpreted as the signature of a massive star (17 - 100 M_sun)
explosion within a He-enriched circumstellar medium. However, unlike previous
Type Ibn supernovae, PS1-12sk is associated with an elliptical brightest
cluster galaxy, CGCG 208-042 (z = 0.054) in cluster RXC J0844.9+4258. The
expected probability of an event like PS1-12sk in such environments is low
given the measured infrequency of core-collapse SNe in red sequence galaxies
compounded by the low volumetric rate of SN Ibn. Furthermore, we find no
evidence of star formation at the explosion site to sensitive limits (Sigma
Halpha < 2x10^-3 M_sun/yr/kpc^2). We therefore discuss white dwarf binary
systems as a possible progenitor channel for SNe Ibn. We conclude that PS1-12sk
represents either a fortuitous and statistically unlikely discovery, evidence
for a top-heavy IMF in galaxy cluster cooling flow filaments, or the first clue
suggesting an alternate progenitor channel for Type Ibn SNe.

less luminous than X-ray selected clusters of similar X-ray temperature at both
moderate and high-z. We are unable to constrain evolution in the Lx-Tx relation
with these data, but find it consistent with no evolution, within relatively
large uncertainties. To investigate selection effects, we compare the X-ray
properties of our sample to those of clusters in the representative X-ray
selected REXCESS sample, also determined within R2500. We find that while RCS
cluster X-ray properties span the entire range of those of massive clusters
selected by other methods, their average X-ray properties are most similar to
those of dynamically disturbed X-ray selected clusters. This similarity
suggests that the true cluster distribution might contain a higher fraction of
disturbed objects than are typically detected in X-ray selected surveys.

strongly radiation dominated accretion disk is studied using a new Godunov
radiation MHD code in the unstratified shearing box approximation. Since
vertical gravity is neglected in this work, our focus is on how the MRI
saturates in the optically thick mid-plane of the disk. We confirm that
turbulence generated by the MRI is very compressible in the radiation dominated
regime, as found by previous calculations using the flux-limited diffusion
approximation. We also find little difference in the saturation properties in
calculations that use a larger horizontal domain (up to four times the vertical
scale height in the radial direction). However, in strongly radiation pressure
dominated disks (one in which the radiation energy density reaches 1% of the
rest mass energy density of the gas), we find Maxwell stress from the MRI
turbulence is larger than the value produced when radiation pressure is
replaced with the same amount of gas pressure. At the same time, the ratio
between Maxwell stress and Reynolds stress is increased by almost a factor of 8
compared with the gas pressure dominated case. We suggest that this effect is
caused by radiation drag, which acts like bulk viscosity and changes the
effective magnetic Prandtl number of the fluid. Radiation viscosity
significantly exceeds both the microscopic plasma viscosity and resistivity,
ensuring that radiation dominated systems occupy the high magnetic Prandtl
number regime. Nevertheless, we find radiative shear viscosity is negligible
compared to the Maxwell and Reynolds stress in the flow. This may have
important implications for the structure of radiation dominated accretion
disks.

the corona faces us with the problem that one has to apply extreme UV
spectro-polarimetry. While for coronal diagnostic techniques already exist
through infrared coronagraphy above the limb and radio observations on the
disk, for the transition region one has to investigate extreme UV observations.
However, so far the success of such observations has been limited, but there
are various projects to get spectro-polarimetric data in the extreme UV in the
near future. Therefore it is timely to study the polarimetric signals we can
expect for such observations through realistic forward modeling.
  We employ a 3D MHD forward model of the solar corona and synthesize the
Stokes I and Stokes V profiles of C IV 1548 A. A signal well above 0.001 in
Stokes V can be expected, even when integrating for several minutes in order to
reach the required signal-to-noise ratio, despite the fact that the intensity
in the model is rapidly changing (just as in observations). Often this
variability of the intensity is used as an argument against transition region
magnetic diagnostics which requires exposure times of minutes. However, the
magnetic field is evolving much slower than the intensity, and thus when
integrating in time the degree of (circular) polarization remains rather
constant. Our study shows the feasibility to measure the transition region
magnetic field, if a polarimetric accuracy on the order of 0.001 can be
reached, which we can expect from planned instrumentation.

discovery of neutrinos emitted by gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Another source of
interest in the results obtained by these telescopes is their possible use for
tests of the applicability of Einstein's Special Relativity to neutrinos,
particularly with respect to modifications that lead to Lorentz invariance
violation that have been conjectured by some models of quantum space-time. We
examine here the fascinating scenario in which these two aspects of
neutrino-telescope physics require a combined analysis. We discuss how
neutrinos that one would not associate to a GRB, when assuming a classical
spacetime picture, may well be GRB neutrinos if the possibility that Lorentz
invariance is broken at very high energies is taken into account. As an
illustrative example we examine three IceCube high energy neutrinos that
arrived hours before GRBs (but from the same direction) and we find that the
available, IceCube data, while inconclusive, is compatible with a scenario in
which one or two of these neutrinos were GRB neutrinos and their earlier
arrival reflects Lorentz invariance violation.
  We outline how future analyses of neutrino data should be done in order to
systematically test this possibility.

we describe the relative orientation of the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ with
respect to the density structures, showing that: 1.The magnetic field shows a
preferential orientation parallel to most of the density structures in the
three simulated cubes. 2.The relative orientation changes from parallel to
perpendicular in regions with density over a critical density $n_{T}$ in the
highest magnetization case. 3.The change of relative orientation is largest for
the highest magnetization and decreases in lower magnetization cases. This

Jones and Stokes-Mueller calculi, having six rather than four degrees of
freedom (DOF), we propose an extension of those calculi to handle all six DOF.
  For the Stokes-Mueller analysis, this leads to a novel and potentially useful
extension that accounts for the absolute phase of the optical field, and which
can be valuable in the areas where the optical phase is of interest, e.g.
interferometry or coherent communications. As examples of the usefulness we use
the formalism to explain the Pancharatnam phase by parallel transport, and
shows its connection with the Berry phase.
  In addition we show that the two extra DOF in the 4d description represents
unphysical transformations, forbidden for propagating photons, since they will
not obey the fundamental quantum mechanical boson commutation relations.

performance. After four years of the Fermi mission in orbit, improved sky
simulations can still be very useful to support the activities of Fermi, to
refine our understanding of the scientific performance and to explore potential
new science cases. We have used the LAT observations collected so far to
develop new, highly-detailed simulations of the sky as seen by LAT. These
simulations include the isotropic and Galactic diffuse emission, as well as the
list of point and extended sources detected by the LAT. Furthermore, our sky
simulations account for transient and variable sources, including Gamma Ray
Bursts, pulsars and flaring blazars. We report on the latest developments of
this new sky simulation work, describing its potential benefits for improving
the science of Fermi today and in the near future.

the even-odd rule of electron filling. Especially, a maximal paramagnetic
current in primary F0/2 period is predicted at N=(2p+1)(M+1) with odd M and
integer p, while a maximal diamagnetic F0/2- current obtained at
N=(2p+1)(M+1)+/-1 with even M. The current amplitudes depend strongly on both N

quantum size effect. A current limit of paramagnetic harmonics is expected at

activity. However, the exact timing of this process remains poorly understood.
Here, we present deep imaging and long slit spectroscopy data of a sample of
four double-peaked [OIII] emitting AGN. These sources are often believed to
host binary AGN, or at least be currently undergoing major mergers. The sample
presented here either have previous IFU and high resolution imaging data that
show double-nuclei in the IR as well as kinematicly and spatially distinct line
emitting regions. Two sources have detections of double point sources in either
the X-ray or radio. The sources studied are therefore likely binary AGN. The
AGN in this sample are luminous, radio-quiet and at low redshift. The $u/r/z$
imaging data show host galaxies in a wide range of merger stages, with the
majority (3/4) showing tidal tails or complex kinematics and morphologies
clearly indicating a recent merger. One source however -hosting a double X-ray
source- shows quiescent morphologies with no clear signs of interaction from
imaging data. The spectroscopy in this case reveals a gas disk counter-rotating
with respect to the stellar component. Spectroscopy of the other sources reveal
disturbed kinematics further confirming their status as ongoing mergers. Our
data show that AGN triggering in mergers may happen over a wide time span and
that sinking of black holes to the center of a merged system might take
considerable time in some cases. A detailed analysis will be published in an
upcoming paper. Further studies of AGN in merging galaxies will show how the
hosts of those AGN differ from normal mergers without AGN activity.

several months, but this period is not evident in the pre-outburst data and is
much shorter than the 12.6 min period that was seen in observations obtained
during an interval from 8 months to 2.5 years after the 2006 outburst. In some
respects, the long and short periods are similar to the behavior seen in GW Lib
after its outburst but the detailed explanation for the appearance and
disappearance of these periods and their relation to non-radial pulsation modes
remain to be explored with theoretical models.

conflicting results, leading to the question of whether the canonical approach
is covariant, and whether the path integral approach is unitary. We show the
unitarity of the covariant U(1) Maxwell theory, defined via the Wick rotation
of a Euclidean path integral. We begin by gauge-fixing the path integral,
taking care with zero modes, large gauge transformations, and nontrivial
bundles. We find an extra geometric factor in the partition function that has
been overlooked in previous work, coming from the zero mode of the gauge
symmetry, which affects the entropy and stress-energy tensor. With this extra
factor, the covariant calculation agrees with the canonical result for
ultrastatic manifolds, and in D = 2. Finally, we argue that if there exists a
unitary (but not necessarily covariant) canonical formulation, then the
covariant formulation must also be unitary, even if the two approaches
disagree.

nova spectra show prominent P Cygni profiles and later all the lines are seen
in emission. The notable feature of the near-IR spec- tra in the early decline
phase is the rare presence of the first overtone bands of carbon monoxide (CO)
in emission. The IR spectra show clear dust formation in the expand- ing ejecta
at later phase about 150 days after the peak brightness. The presence of lines
of elements with low ionization potentials like Na and Mg in the early IR
spectra and the detection of CO bands in emission and the dust formation in
V496 Sct represents a complete expected sequence in the dust formation in nova
ejecta. The light curve shows a slow rise to the maximum and a slow decline
indicating a prolonged mass loss. This is corroborated by the strengthening of
P Cygni profiles during the first 30 days. The broad and single absorption
components seen in many lines in the optical spectra at the time of discovery
are replaced by two sharper components in the spectra taken close to the
optical maximum brightness. These sharp dips seen in the P Cygni absorption
components of Fe II and H I lines during the early decline phase show
increasing outflow velocities. The onset of the nebular phase is evident from
the optical spectra in 2010 March. During the nebular phase, several emission

of [O III] and H lines are used to estimate the electron number densities and
the mass of the ejecta. The optical spectra show that the nova is evolved in

Autler-Townes splitting(ATS) in an open V-type molecular system. Through
detailed analytical calculations on the absorption spectrum of probe laser
field by using residue theorem and spectrum decomposition, we find that EIT may
occur and there exists a crossover from EIT to ATS (i.e. EIT-ATS crossover) for
hot molecules. However, there is no EIT and hence no EIT-ATS crossover for cold
molecules. Furthermore, we prove that for hot molecules EIT is allowed even for
a counter-propagating configuration. We provide explicit formulas of EIT
conditions and widths of EIT transparency windows of probe field when hot
molecules work in co-propagating and counter-propagating configurations,
respectively. Our theoretical result agrees well with the recent experimental
one reported by Lazoudis et al. [Phys. Rev. A 83, 063419 (2011)].

that the contributions coming from the neutralinos and charginos should be more

intuition. Two distinct problems are considered: the first is where the stress
is assumed continuous across the boundary of the two regions, which assumption
has a sound physical basis. The second problem considered is more speculative:
it is where discontinuities of stress are allowed. It is shown that such
discontinuities are necessarily small for many applications, but might
nonetheless provide an explanation for the damage incurred by repeated flexure.

Recently, they have been linked to aging of Escherichia coli (E. coli) where
protein aggregates accumulate at the old pole region of the aging bacterium.
Because of the potential of E. coli as a model organism, elucidating aging and
protein aggregation in this bacterium may pave the way to significant advances
in our global understanding of aging. A first obstacle along this path is to
decipher the mechanisms by which protein aggregates are targeted to specific
intercellular locations. Here, using an integrated approach based on
individual-based modeling, time-lapse fluorescence microscopy and automated
image analysis, we show that the movement of aging-related protein aggregates
in E. coli is purely diffusive (Brownian). Using single-particle tracking of
protein aggregates in live E. coli cells, we estimated the average size and
diffusion constant of the aggregates. Our results evidence that the aggregates
passively diffuse within the cell, with diffusion constants that depend on
their size in agreement with the Stokes-Einstein law. However, the aggregate
displacements along the cell long axis are confined to a region that roughly
corresponds to the nucleoid-free space in the cell pole, thus confirming the
importance of increased macromolecular crowding in the nucleoids. We thus used
3d individual-based modeling to show that these three ingredients (diffusion,
aggregation and diffusion hindrance in the nucleoids) are sufficient and
necessary to reproduce the available experimental data on aggregate
localization in the cells. Taken together, our results strongly support the
hypothesis that the localization of aging-related protein aggregates in the
poles of E. coli results from the coupling of passive diffusion- aggregation
with spatially non-homogeneous macromolecular crowding. They further support
the importance of ""soft"" intracellular structuring (based on macromolecular
crowding) in diffusion-based protein localization in E. coli.

presence of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in infrared (IR) galaxies at z>1, down
to flux densities at which the extragalactic IR background is mostly resolved.
I derive this diagnostic from the analysis of 174 galaxies with Snu(24)>80
microJy and spectroscopic redshifts zspec>1 in the Chandra Deep Field South,
for which I study the rest-frame UV/optical/near-IR spectral energy
distributions (SEDs), after subtracting a hot-dust, power-law component with
three possible spectral indices alpha=1.3, 2.0 and 3.0. I obtain that 35% of
these 24micron sources are power-law composite galaxies (PLCGs), which I define
as those galaxies for which the SED fitting with stellar templates, without any
previous power-law subtraction, can be rejected with >2sigma confidence.
Subtracting the power-law component from the PLCG SEDs produces stellar-mass
correction factors <1.5 in >80% of cases. The PLCG incidence is especially high
(47%) at z=1.0-1.5. To unveil which PLCGs host AGN, I conduct a combined
analysis of 4Ms X-ray data, galaxy morphologies, and a greybody modelling of
the hot dust. I find that: 1) 77% of all the X-ray AGN in my 24micron sample at
z=1.0-1.5 are recognised by the PLCG criterion; 2) PLCGs with alpha=1.3 or 2.0
have regular morphologies and T_dust >~1000 K, indicating nuclear activity.
Instead, PLCGs with alpha=3.0 are characterised by disturbed galaxy dynamics,
and a hot interstellar medium can explain their dust temperatures T_dust
~700-800 K. Overall, my results indicate that the fraction of AGN among 24
micron sources is between ~30% and 52% at z=1.0-1.5.

hysteresis of 264{\deg}C caused by the high energy barrier due to the change of
stacking of Sm, Ir and Si basal plane sheets within the transition. Both

considerably different magnetic phase transitions determined for the LTP and

to have abundant applications in future machine or sensor based wireless

system, where a multi-antenna access point (AP) sends information and energy
simultaneously via spatial multiplexing to multiple single-antenna receivers
each of which implements information decoding (ID) or energy harvesting (EH).
Since EH receivers in practice operate with considerably higher received power
than ID receivers, we propose a receiver location based transmission
scheduling, where receivers that are close to the AP are scheduled for EH while
those more distant from the AP for ID. We aim to maximize the weighted
sum-power transferred to all EH receivers subject to a given set of minimum
signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at different ID
receivers. In particular, we consider two types of ID receivers (referred to as
Type I and Type II, respectively) without or with the capability of cancelling
the interference from (a priori known) energy signals. For each type of ID
receivers, we formulate the joint information and energy transmit beamforming
design as a non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP).
First, we obtain the globally optimal solutions for our formulated QCQPs by
applying an optimization technique so-called semidefinite relaxation (SDR). It
is shown via SDR that no dedicated energy beam is needed for Type I ID
receivers to achieve the optimal solution; while for Type II ID receivers,
employing no more than one energy beam is optimal. Next, we establish a new
form of the celebrated uplink-downlink duality to develop alternative
algorithms to obtain the same optimal solutions as SDR.

optimized. In particular, for design convenience, it is common to prefix the AN
covariance as a specific kind of spatially isotropic covariance. This paper
considers joint optimization of the transmit and AN covariances for secrecy
rate maximization (SRM), with a design flexibility that the AN can take any
spatial pattern. Hence, the proposed design has potential in jamming the
eavesdroppers more effectively, based upon the channel state information (CSI).
We derive an optimization approach to the SRM problem through both analysis and
convex conic optimization machinery. We show that the SRM problem can be recast
as a single-variable optimization problem, and that resultant problem can be
efficiently handled by solving a sequence of semidefinite programs. Our
framework deals with a general setup of multiple multi-antenna eavesdroppers,
and can cater for additional constraints arising from specific application
scenarios, such as interference temperature constraints in interference
networks. We also generalize the framework to an imperfect CSI case where a
worst-case robust SRM formulation is considered. A suboptimal but safe solution
to the outage-constrained robust SRM design is also investigated. Simulation
results show that the proposed AN-aided SRM design yields significant secrecy
rate gains over an optimal no-AN design and the isotropic AN design, especially
when there are more eavesdroppers.

continuous symmetries that also include dynamics. For such systems, we review
the reduction of the vacuum Einstein field equations to their most concise form
by dimensionally reducing to the three-dimensional space of orbits of the
Killing vector, followed by a conformal rescaling. The resulting field
equations can be written as a problem in three-dimensional gravity with a
complex scalar field as source. This scalar field, the Ernst potential is
constructed from the norm and twist of the spacelike Killing field. In the case
where the axial Killing vector is twist-free, we discuss the properties of the
axis and simplify the field equations using a triad formalism. We study two
physically motivated triad choices that further reduce the complexity of the
equations and exhibit their hierarchical structure. The first choice is adapted
to a harmonic coordinate that asymptotes to a cylindrical radius and leads to a
simplification of the three-dimensional Ricci tensor and the boundary
conditions on the axis. We illustrate its properties by explicitly solving the
field equations in the case of static axisymmetric spacetimes. The other choice
of triad is based on geodesic null coordinates adapted to null infinity as in
the Bondi formalism. We then explore the solution space of the twist-free
axisymmetric vacuum field equations, identifying the known (unphysical)
solutions together with the assumptions made in each case. This singles out the
necessary conditions for obtaining physical solutions to the equations.

favorable geometry in observing the binary nearly edge-on. Her X-1 is the
binary X-ray pulsar in which the first cyclotron line (or Cyclotron Resonant

effort to observe the source and the CRSF around 40 keV as often as possible,
using those X-ray satellites which cover the high energy X-ray range. Extended
contributions are from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE), {INTEGRAL,
Suzaku and Swift. The most recent contribution with a new degree of quality is
from the high energy imaging telescope on NuStar. We have found that the CRSF
is variable with flux, with phase (both pulsational and precessional phase) and
with time. The historical evolution of the pulse phase averaged CRSF centroid
energy Ecyc since its discovery is characterized by an initial value around 35
keV, an abrupt jump upwards to beyond ~40$ keV between 1990 and 1994 and an
apparent secular decay thereafter. Much of this decay, however, was found to be
due to an artifact, namely a correlation between Ecyc and the X-ray luminosity
Lx discovered in 2007, amounting to a change of ~7% in energy for a factor of
two in luminosity. In observations since 2007, however, we now find a
statistically significant trend of a true secular decrease of the cyclotron
line energy. In addition, we discuss recent results of pulse phase spectroscopy

recently presented a near-infrared (near-IR) relationship for estimating AGN
black hole masses based on the widths of the Paschen hydrogen broad emission
lines and the total 1 micron continuum luminosity. The near-IR offers several
advantages over the optical: it suffers less from dust extinction, the AGN
continuum is observed only weakly contaminated by the host galaxy and the
strongest Paschen broad emission lines Pa alpha and Pa beta are unblended. Here
we improve the calibration of the near-IR black hole mass relationship by
increasing the sample from 14 to 23 reverberation-mapped AGN using additional
spectroscopy obtained with the Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph (GNIRS). The
additional sample improves the number statistics in particular at the high

opposes a pentagonal ring. This state lies ~0.2 eV lower in energy than the
open-shell singlet with one spin flipped, which is a bistable system with two
equivalent equilibrium lattice configurations (for the apical C atom above or
below the lattice plane) and a barrier ~0.1 eV high separating them.
Accordingly, a bare carbon-atom vacancy is predicted to be a spin-one
paramagnetic species, but spin-half paramagnetism can be accommodated if
binding to foreign species, ripples, coupling to a substrate, or doping are
taken into account.

article investigates the influence of the existence of a mirror world, focusing
on models in which neutrons can oscillate into mirror neutrons. Such a
mechanism allows for an effective late time neutron injection, which induces an
increase of the destruction of beryllium-7, due to an increase of the neutron

separations r of 80 Mpc/h. For r > 15 Mpc/h, we show that the cross-correlation
is well fitted by the linear theory prediction for the mean overdensity around
a quasar host halo in the standard \Lambda CDM model, with the redshift
distortions indicative of gravitational evolution detected at high confidence.
Using previous determinations of the Lyman \alpha\ forest bias factor obtained
from the Lyman \alpha\ autocorrelation, we infer the quasar bias factor to be
b_q = 3.64^+0.13_-0.15 at a mean redshift z=2.38, in agreement with previous
measurements from the quasar auto-correlation. We also obtain a new estimate of
the Lyman \alpha\ forest redshift distortion factor, \beta_F = 1.1 +/- 0.15,
slightly larger than but consistent with the previous measurement from the
Lyman \alpha\ forest autocorrelation. The simple linear model we use fails at
separations r < 15 Mpc/h, and we show that this may reasonably be due to the
enhanced ionization due to radiation from the quasars. We also provide the
expected correction that the mass overdensity around the quasar implies for
measurements of the ionizing radiation background from the line-of-sight

covariance structure of neural activities and animal percept. These
characteristic equations implicitly determine the readout parameters that were
used by the animal to create its percept. In particular, they implicitly
constrain the temporal integration window w and the typical number of neurons K
which give rise to the percept. Comparing neural and behavioral sensitivity
alone cannot disentangle these two sources of perceptual integration, so the
characteristic equations also involve a measure of choice signals, like those
assessed by the classic experimental measure of choice probabilities. We then
propose a statistical method of analysis which allows to recover the typical
scales of integration w and K from finite numbers of recorded neurons and
recording trials, and show the efficiency of this method on an artificial
encoding network. We also study the statistical method theoretically, and
relate its laws of convergence to the underlying structure of neural activity

Altogether, our method provides the first thorough interpretation of

readily be applied to experimental recordings in classic sensory

50 years ago, Askaryan proposed to detect Cherenkov signals by radio wave from
the negative charge excess of particle showers. The theory of Cherenkov pulses
with Fraunhofer approximation was widely studied in the past two decades.
However, at high energies or for high density materials, electromagnetic shower
should be elongated due to the Landau-Pomeranchuck-Migdal (LPM) effect. As such
the standard Fraunhofer approximation ceases to be valid when the distance
between the shower and the detector becomes comparable with the shower length.
We have performed Monte Carlo simulations recently to investigate this regime
based on the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, and modified time
domain integration method. In this work, we adopt the deduced relationship
between the radio signal and the cascade development profile to investigate its
implication to lepton signatures. Our method provides a straightforward
technique to identify the neutrino flavor through the detected Cherenkov

the magnetic network, faculae and sunspots. Analysis of VIRGO data shows that
on periods of a day or longer solar variability depends on magnetic activity,
but is nearly independent at shorter periods. We assume that only granulation
affects the solar irradiance variability on time scales from minutes to hours.
Granulation is described as a large sample of bright cells and dark lanes that
evolve according to rules deduced from observations and radiation hydrodynamic
simulations. Comparison of this model combined with a high time resolution
magnetic-field based irradiance reconstruction, with solar data reveals a good
correspondence except at periods of 10 to 30 hours. This suggests that the
model is missing some power at these periods, which may be due to the absence
of supergranulation or insufficient sensitivity of MDI magnetograms used for
the reconstruction of the magnetic field-based irradiance reconstructions. Our
model also shows that even for spatially unresolved data (such as those
available for stars) the Fourier or wavelet transform of time series sampled at

alignment signal: 1) the alignment two-point correlation function which probes
the dependence of galaxy clustering at a given separation in redshift space on
the projected angle (theta_p) between the orientation of galaxies and the line
connecting to other galaxies, and 2) the cos(2theta)-statistic which estimates
the average of cos(2theta_p) for all correlated pairs at given separation. We
find significant alignment signal out to about 70 Mpc/h in both statistics.
Applications of the same statistics to dark matter halos of mass above 10^12
M_sun/h in a large cosmological simulation show similar scale-dependent
alignment signals to the observation, but with higher amplitudes at all scales
probed. We show that this discrepancy may be partially explained by a
misalignment angle between central galaxies and their host halos, though
detailed modeling is needed in order to better understand the link between the
orientations of galaxies and host halos. In addition, we find systematic trends
of the alignment statistics with the stellar mass of the CMASS galaxies, in the
sense that more massive galaxies are more strongly aligned with the large-scale

direction in consecutive time steps, arises by a permutation of this coin
operator. We describe the basic properties of both walks and prove that the
even-order joint moments of the nonrepeating walker are independent of the
initial condition, being determined by five parameters derived from the coin
instead. Numerical evidence suggests that the same is the case for the
nonreversal walk. This contrasts strongly with previously studied coins, such
as the Grover operator, where the initial condition can be used to control the
standard deviation of the walker.

lies close to the Galactic Centre. We explore how its gas and dust temperatures
react as we vary the strength of both the interstellar radiation field (ISRF)
and the cosmic ray ionisation rate (CRIR). As the physical extent of
G0.253+0.016 along our line-of-sight is unknown, we consider two possibilities:
one in which the longest axis is that measured in the plane of the sky (9.4 pc
in length), and one in which it is along the line of sight, in which case we
take it to be 17 pc. To recover the observed gas and dust temperatures, we find
find that the ISRF must be around 1000 times the solar neighbourhood value, and
the CRIR must be roughly 1E-14 /s, regardless of the geometries studied. For
such high values of the CRIR, we find that cooling in the cloud's interior is
dominated by neutral oxygen, in contrast to standard molecular clouds, which at
the same densities are mainly cooled via CO. Our results suggest that the
conditions near G0.253+0.016 are more extreme than those generally accepted for
the inner 500 pc of the galaxy.

commutative subalgebra isomorphic to the algebra $Z_G$ of regular functions on
(a finite covering of a big cell in) a complex connected, simply connected

finite-dimensional representation of $U_\varepsilon({\mathfrak g})$ on which
$Z_G$ acts according to a non-trivial character $\eta_g$ given by evaluation of
regular functions at $g\in G$. Then $V$ is a representation of the

under certain restrictions on $m$, $U_{\eta_g}$ contains a subalgebra
$U_{\eta_g}({\mathfrak m}_-)$ of dimension $m^{{\frac{1}{2}}{\rm
dim}~\mathcal{O}}$, where $\mathcal{O}$ is the conjugacy class of $g$, and
$U_{\eta_g}({\mathfrak m}_-)$ has a one-dimensional representation
$\mathbb{C}_{\chi_g}$. We also prove that if $V$ is not trivial then the space
of Whittaker vectors ${\rm Hom}_{U_{\eta_g}({\mathfrak
m}_-)}(\mathbb{C}_{\chi_g},V)$ is not trivial and the algebra $W_{\eta_g}={\rm
End}_{U_{\eta_g}}(U_{\eta_g}\otimes_{U_{\eta_g}({\mathfrak

have relied on matched filtering banks of waveforms (called template banks) to
try to extract the signal waveforms from the detector data. These template
banks have been constructed using four main considerations, the region of
parameter space of interest, the sensitivity of the detector, the matched
filtering bandwidth, and the sensitivity one is willing to lose due to the
granularity of template placement, the latter of which is governed by the
minimal match. In this work we describe how the choice of the lower frequency
cutoff, the lower end of the matched filter frequency band, can be optimized
for detection. We also show how the minimal match can be optimally chosen in
the case of limited computational resources. These techniques are applied to
searches for binary neutron star signals that have been previously performed
when analyzing Initial LIGO and Virgo data and will be performed analyzing

outburst, which is related to the orbital period of 26.4960 +/- 0.0028d,
exibits a modulation of 1667 +/- 8 d. The radio emission at high spatial
resolution appears structured in a precessing jet with a precessional period of
27-28 d. Aims: How close is the precessional period of the radio jet to the
orbital period? Any periodicity in the radio emission should be revealed by
timing analysis. The aim of this work is to establish the accurate value of the
precessional period. Methods: We analyzed 6.7 years of the Green Bank
Interferometer database at 2.2 GHz and 8.3 GHz with the Lomb-Scargle and phase
dispersion minimization (PDM) methods and performed simulations. Results: The
periodograms show two periodicities, P1 = 26.49 +/- 0.07 d (\nu1=0.03775
d^{-1}) and P2 = 26.92 +/- 0.07 d (\nu2 = 0.03715 d^{-1}). Whereas radio
outbursts have been known to have nearly orbital occurrence P1 with timing
residuals exhibiting a puzzling sawtooth pattern, we probe in this paper that
they are actually periodical outbursts and that their period is Paverage=
(2/(\nu1 + \nu2)= 26.70 +/- 0.05 d. The period Paverage as well as the
long-term modulation Pbeat=1/(\nu1 - \nu2)=1667 +/- 393 d result from the beat
of the two close periods, the orbital P1 and the precessional P2 periods.
Conclusions: The precessional period, indicated by the astrometry to be of
27--28 d, is P2=26.92 d. The system \lsi seems to be one more case in astronomy
of beat, i.e., a phenomenon occurring when two physical processes create stable
variations of nearly equal frequencies. The very small difference in frequency
creates a long-term variation of period 1/(\nu1-\nu2). The long-term modulation
of 1667 d results from the beat of the two close orbital and precessional
rates.

finding galaxies at high redshift, and thus probe the structure of the early
universe. However, the resonance nature of the line and its sensitivity to dust
and neutral gas is still not fully understood.
  Aims. We present measurements of the velocity, covering fraction and optical
depth of neutral gas in front of two well known local blue compact galaxies
that show Lyman alpha in emission: ESO 338-IG 04 and Haro 11. We thus test
observationally the hypothesis that Lyman alpha can escape through neutral gas
by being Doppler shifted out of resonance.
  Methods. We present integral field spectroscopy from the GIRAFFE/Argus
spectrograph at VLT/FLAMES in Paranal, Chile. The excellent wavelength
resolution allows us to accurately measure the velocity of the ionized and
neutral gas through the H-alpha emission and Na D absorption, which traces the
ionized medium and cold interstellar gas, respectively. We also present
independent measurements with the VLT/X-shooter spectrograph which confirm our
results.
  Results. For ESO 338-IG04, we measure no significant shift of neutral gas.
The best fit velocity is -15 (16) km/s. For Haro 11, we see an outflow from
knot B at 44 (13) km/s and infalling gas towards knot C with 32 (12) km/s.
Based on the relative strength of the Na D absorption lines, we estimate low
covering fractions of neutral gas (down to 10%) in all three cases.
  Conclusions. The Na D absorption likely occurs in dense clumps with higher
column densities than where the bulk of the Ly-alpha scattering takes place.
Still, we find no strong correlation between outflowing neutral gas and a high
Lyman alpha escape fraction. The Lyman alpha photons from these two galaxies
are therefore likely escaping due to a low column density and/or covering
fraction.

because of the well-known mapping between their phases and those of models with

critical disorder strength Wc where the average inverse participation ratio
goes to zero; at small disorder W < Wc the model lies in a delocalized phase.
This result is based on numerical calculation of the inverse participation
ratio in the infinite volume limit using an exact renormalization group
approach facilitated by the model's hierarchical structure. Our results are
consistent with the presence of an Anderson transition in short-range models

central idea that artificial intelligence, mainstream computing, and much of
human perception and cognition, may be understood as information compression.
  The background and origins of the SP theory are described, and the main
elements of the theory, including the key concept of multiple alignment,
borrowed from bioinformatics but with important differences. Associated with
the SP theory is the idea that redundancy in information may be understood as
repetition of patterns, that compression of information may be achieved via the
matching and unification (merging) of patterns, and that computing and
information compression are both fundamentally probabilistic. It appears that
the SP system is Turing-equivalent in the sense that anything that may be
computed with a Turing machine may, in principle, also be computed with an SP
machine.
  One of the main strengths of the SP theory and the multiple alignment concept
is in modelling concepts and phenomena in artificial intelligence. Within that
area, the SP theory provides a simple but versatile means of representing
different kinds of knowledge, it can model both the parsing and production of
natural language, with potential for the understanding and translation of
natural languages, it has strengths in pattern recognition, with potential in
computer vision, it can model several kinds of reasoning, and it has
capabilities in planning, problem solving, and unsupervised learning.
  The paper includes two examples showing how alternative parsings of an
ambiguous sentence may be modelled as multiple alignments, and another example
showing how the concept of multiple alignment may be applied in medical
diagnosis.

necessary but not sufficient condition for phantom crossing. We use pressure
properties, such as asymptotic behavior and fixed points, to qualitatively
describe the entire behavior of a solution in flat FLRW models. We discuss FLRW

node of the network, its membership to one of more groups of nodes, the
communities, that are densely connected, or highly interactive, or, more in
general, similar, according to a similarity function. So far, the problem has
been widely studied in monodimensional networks, i.e. networks where only one
connection between two entities can exist. However, real networks are often
multidimensional, i.e., multiple connections between any two nodes can exist,
either reflecting different kinds of relationships, or representing different
values of the same type of tie. In this context, the problem of Community
Discovery has to be redefined, taking into account multidimensional structure
of the graph. We define a new concept of community that groups together nodes
sharing memberships to the same monodimensional communities in the different
single dimensions. As we show, such communities are meaningful and able to
group highly correlated nodes, even if they might not be connected in any of
the monodimensional networks. We devise ABACUS (Apriori-BAsed Community
discoverer in mUltidimensional networkS), an algorithm that is able to extract
multidimensional communities based on the apriori itemset miner applied to
monodimensional community memberships. Experiments on two different real
multidimensional networks confirm the meaningfulness of the introduced
concepts, and open the way for a new class of algorithms for community
discovery that do not rely on the dense connections among nodes.

lifetime T_1 is limited by spin relaxation, where the Zeeman energy is absorbed
by lattice vibrations, mediated by spin-orbit and electron-phonon coupling. We
have calculated T_1 by treating all couplings analytically and find that T_1
can be in the range of seconds for several reasons: (i) low phonon density of
states away from Van Hove singularities; (ii) destructive interference between
two relaxation mechanisms; (iii) Van Vleck cancellation at low magnetic fields;
(iv) vanishing coupling to out-of-plane modes in lowest order due to the
electronic structure of aGNRs. Owing to the vanishing nuclear spin of 12C, T_1

efficiency in PDRs and the charge of PAHs, which are considered to play a key
role in photoelectric heating. Using PACS onboard Herschel, we observed six
PDRs spanning a wide range of FUV radiation fields (G_0=100-10^5). To measure
the photoelectric heating efficiency, we obtained the intensities of the main
cooling lines, i.e., the [OI]63um, 145um, and [CII]158um, as well as the FIR
continuum intensity. We used Spitzer/IRS spectroscopic mapping observations to
investigate the MIR PAH features in the same regions. We decomposed the MIR PAH
emission into that of neutral (PAH^0) and positively ionized (PAH^+) species to
derive the fraction of the positively charged PAHs, and compare it to the
photoelectric heating efficiency. The heating efficiency traced by
([OI]63um+[OI]145um+[CII]158um) / TIR, ranges between 0.1% and 0.9% in
different sources, and the fraction of PAH^+ relative to (PAH^0 + PAH^+) spans
from 0(+11)% to 87(+/-10)%. All positions with a high PAH^+ fraction show a low
heating efficiency, and all positions with a high heating efficiency have a low
PAH^+ fraction, supporting the scenario in which a positive grain charge
results in a decreased heating efficiency. Theoretical estimates of the
photoelectric heating efficiency show a stronger dependence on the charging
parameter gamma=G_0 T^{1/2}/n_e than the observed efficiency reported in this
study, and the discrepancy is significant at low gamma. The photoelectric
heating efficiency on PAHs, traced by ([OI]63um+[OI]145um+[CII]158um) /
(PAH+[OI]63um+[OI]145um+[CII]158um), shows a much better match between the
observations and the theoretical estimates. The good agreement of the
photoelectric heating efficiency on PAHs with a theoretical model indicates the
dominant contribution of PAHs to the photoelectric heating. (abridged for

connection of the proposed spectral analysis method with the Discrete Fourier
Transform (DFT), the most extensively studied and frequently used approach in
the history of signal processing. It is shown that in a typical application
case, where uniform data readings are transformed to the same number of
uniformly spaced frequencies, the results of the classical DFT and proposed
approach coincide. The difference in performance appears when the length of the
DFT is selected to be greater than the length of the data. The DFT solves the
unknown data problem by padding readings with zeros up to the length of the
DFT, while the proposed Extended DFT (EDFT) deals with this situation in a
different way, it uses the Fourier integral transform as a target and optimizes
the transform basis in the extended frequency range without putting such
restrictions on the time domain. Consequently, the Inverse DFT (IDFT) applied
to the result of EDFT returns not only known readings, but also the
extrapolated data, where classical DFT is able to give back just zeros, and
higher resolution are achieved at frequencies where the data has been
successfully extended. It has been demonstrated that EDFT able to process data
with missing readings or gaps inside or even nonuniformly distributed data.
Thus, EDFT significantly extends the usability of the DFT-based methods, where
previously these approaches have been considered as not applicable. The EDFT
founds the solution in an iterative way and requires repeated calculations to
get the adaptive basis, and this makes it numerical complexity much higher
compared to DFT. This disadvantage was a serious problem in the 1990s, when the
method has been proposed. Fortunately, since then the power of computers has
increased so much that nowadays EDFT application could be considered as a real
alternative.

(MC-DCSK) modulation is presented. The system endeavors to provide a good
trade-off between robustness, energy efficiency and high data rate, while still
being simple. In this architecture of MC-DCSK system, for each user, chaotic
reference sequence is transmitted over a predefined subcarrier frequency.
Multiple modulated data streams are transmitted over the remaining subcarriers
allocated for each user. This transmitter structure saves energy and increases
the spectral efficiency of the conventional DCSK system.

extending in a large region of space, will get a smaller mass when confined
into a smaller region, because of its own gravitational energy. The classical
self-energy problem has been studied in the past in connection with the
renormalization of a charged point particle. Still exact consistent solutions
have not been thoroughly discussed in the simpler framework of Newtonian
gravity. Here we exploit a spherical symmetrical shell model and find two
possible solutions, depending on some additional assumption. The first solution
goes back to Arnowitt, Deser and Misner (1960). The second is new and yields a
new vanishingly small value (10^-55 cm) for the classical electron radius.

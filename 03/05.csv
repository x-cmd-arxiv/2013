mass and super massive black holes. Their interpretation involves reflection of
a hard source of photons onto an accretion disk, producing a delayed reflected
emission, with a time lag consistent with the light travel time between the
irradiating source and the disk. Independently of the location of the clock,
the kHz Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO) emission is thought to arise from the
neutron star boundary layer. Here, we search for the signature of reverberation
of the kHz QPO emission, by measuring the soft lags and the lag energy spectrum
of the lower kHz QPOs from 4U1608-52. Soft lags, ranging from ~15 to ~40
microseconds, between the 3-8 keV and 8-30 keV modulated emissions are detected
between 565 and 890 Hz. The soft lags are not constant with frequency and show
a smooth decrease between 680 Hz and 890 Hz. The broad band X-ray spectrum is
modeled as the sum of a disk and a thermal comptonized component, plus a broad
iron line, expected from reflection. The spectral parameters follow a smooth
relationship with the QPO frequency, in particular the fitted inner disk radius
decreases steadily with frequency. Both the bump around the iron line in the
lag energy spectrum, and the consistency between the lag changes and the
inferred changes of the inner disk radius, from either spectral fitting or the
QPO frequency, suggest that the soft lags may indeed involve reverberation of
the hard pulsating QPO source on the disk.

anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. In order to develop this analysis we construct
the complete set of normalized eigenfunctions in the corresponding spacetime.
We consider a special case of boundary conditions on the AdS boundary, when the
MIT bag boundary condition is imposed on the field operator at a finite
distance from the boundary, which is then taken to zero. The FC and the VEV of
the energy-momentum tensor are decomposed into the pure AdS and string-induced
parts. Because the analysis of one-loop quantum effects in the AdS spacetime
has been developed in the literature, here we are mainly interested to
investigate the influence of the cosmic string on the VEVs. The string-induced
part in the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor is diagonal and the axial and
radial stresses are equal to the energy density. For points near the string,
the effects of the curvature are subdominant and to leading order, the VEVs
coincide with the corresponding VEVs for the cosmic string in Minkowski bulk.
At large proper distances from the string, the decay of the VEVs show a
power-law dependence of the distance for both massless and massive fields. This
is in contrast to the case of Minkowski bulk where, for a massive field, the
string-induced parts decay exponentially.

So far, two processes have been proposed to explain this behaviour: the
presence of stochastic oscillations, and the excitation of time-dependent
frequencies by nonlinear resonance.
  I argue for a third explanation for the observations, in the form of chaos
due to the nonlinear behaviour of the dominant radial mode.
  The long-term frequency stability of the dominant radial mode is studied
using archival data spanning roughly 20 years. Nonlinear time series analysis
techniques are applied to the CoRoT observations, and the observations are
compared with simulations of a simple nonlinear oscillator.
  I show that chaos offers one single explanation for many of the observed
features, such as the structure in the autocorrelation of the power spectrum,
the long-term frequency shift, the power excess and the wide range of
frequencies in the power spectrum. However, the mixture of opacity-driven
linear oscillations and nonlinear oscillations complicate the nonlinear time
series analysis techniques.

luminosity of 5.0 inverse femtobarns (5.1 inverse femtobarns) collected in pp
collisions at the center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV (8 TeV). Events are considered
where the top-quark pair decays to either one lepton+jets (t tbar to ell nu q
q' b bbar) or dileptons (t tbar to ell(+) nu ell(-) nu b bbar), ell being an
electron or a muon. The search is optimized for the decay mode H to b bbar. The
largest background to the t tbar H signal is top-quark pair production with
additional jets. Artificial neural networks are used to discriminate between
signal and background events. Combining the results from the 7 TeV and 8 TeV
samples, the observed (expected) limit on the cross section for Higgs boson
production in association with top-quark pairs for a Higgs boson mass of 125
GeV is 5.8 (5.2) times the standard model expectation.

field theory (DMFT). The electric polarization of a correlated band insulator
is determined by the interplay of ionicity and covalency, and both quantities
are renormalized by the electron-electron interactions. We introduce
quasiparticle approximation to the exact equation for the polarization, and
compare the results of this approximation with those of the exact DMFT
formulation and of static mean field theories such as the LDA+ U. The latter
overestimates the electronic contribution to the electric polarization when the
quasiparticle weight of the active bands is very small.

Our dataset includes accreting T Tauri stars (CTTS) in Taurus, Chamaeleon I,
$\eta$ Chamaeleon and the TW Hydra Association. For each source we calculate
the accretion rate by fitting the NUV and optical excesses above the
photosphere, produced in the accretion shock, introducing multiple accretion
components characterized by a range in energy flux (or density) for the first
time. This treatment is motivated by models of the magnetospheric geometry and
accretion footprints, which predict that high density, low filling factor
accretion spots co-exist with low density, high filling factor spots. By
fitting the UV and optical spectra with multiple accretion components, we can
explain excesses which have been observed in the near infrared. Comparing our
estimates of the accretion rate to previous estimates, we find some
discrepancies; however, they may be accounted for when considering assumptions
for the amount of extinction and variability in optical spectra. Therefore, we
confirm many previous estimates of the accretion rate. Finally, we measure
emission line luminosities from the same spectra used for the accretion rate
estimates, to produce correlations between accretion indicators (H$\beta$, Ca
II K, C II] and Mg II) and accretion properties obtained simultaneously.

extra U(1)' gauge group. The proposed Little Z' models allow a lower mass Z'
due to the spontaneously broken extra U(1)' gauge group having a reduced gauge
coupling. We show that reducing the value of the extra gauge coupling relaxes
the experimental limits, leading to the possibility of low mass Z' resonances,
for example down to 200 GeV, which may yet appear in LHC searches. Although the
source of tree level fine-tuning due to the Z' mass is reduced in Little Z'
models, it typically does so at the expense of increasing the vacuum
expectation value of the U(1)'-breaking standard model singlet field, reducing
the fine-tuning to similar levels to that in the Minimal Supersymmetric

semantically, the successor of a given state is not uniquely determined by the

an operator, called an ""unbinder"", which explicitely deletes the binding of a

with an aggregate evaluation from a number of non-experts, in applications
ranging from rating and categorizing online content to evaluation of student
assignments in massively open online courses via peer grading. A key issue in
these settings, where direct monitoring is infeasible, is incentivizing agents
in the `crowd' to put in effort to make good evaluations, as well as to
truthfully report their evaluations. This leads to a new family of information
elicitation problems with unobservable ground truth, where an agent's
proficiency- the probability with which she correctly evaluates the underlying
ground truth- is endogenously determined by her strategic choice of how much
effort to put into the task.
  Our main contribution is a simple, new, mechanism for binary information
elicitation for multiple tasks when agents have endogenous proficiencies, with
the following properties: (i) Exerting maximum effort followed by truthful
reporting of observations is a Nash equilibrium. (ii) This is the equilibrium
with maximum payoff to all agents, even when agents have different maximum
proficiencies, can use mixed strategies, and can choose a different strategy
for each of their tasks. Our information elicitation mechanism requires only
minimal bounds on the priors, asks agents to only report their own evaluations,
and does not require any conditions on a diverging number of agent reports per
task to achieve its incentive properties. The main idea behind our mechanism is
to use the presence of multiple tasks and ratings to identify and penalize
low-effort agreement: the mechanism rewards agents for agreeing with a
`reference' rater on a task but also penalizes for blind agreement by
subtracting out a statistic term designed so that agents obtain reward only
when they put effort into their observations.

except for loop-induced corrections. Notably the existence of this SM-like
point, which is absent in the MSSM, is shared with supersymmetric theories

in the arms race with the adaptive immune system. When cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells
or neutralizing antibodies target a new epitope, the virus often escapes via
nonsynonymous mutations that impair recognition. Synonymous mutations do not
affect this interplay and are often assumed to be neutral. We analyze
longitudinal intrapatient data from the C2-V5 part of the envelope gene (env)
and observe that synonymous derived alleles rarely fix even though they often
reach high frequencies in the viral population. We find that synonymous
mutations that disrupt base pairs in RNA stems flanking the variable loops of
gp120 are more likely to be lost than other synonymous changes, hinting at a
direct fitness effect of these stem-loop structures in the HIV-1 RNA.
Computational modeling indicates that these synonymous mutations have a
(Malthusian) selection coefficient of the order of -0.002 and that they are
brought up to high frequency by hitchhiking on neighboring beneficial
nonsynonymous alleles. The patterns of fixation of nonsynonymous mutations
estimated from the longitudinal data and comparisons with computer models
suggest that escape mutations in C2-V5 are only transiently beneficial, either
because the immune system is catching up or because of competition between
equivalent escapes.

one might think that it should not be possible for a sender and receiver to
communicate reliably when the receiver performs a large number of sequential
measurements to determine the message of the sender. We show here that this
intuition is not true, by demonstrating that a sequential decoding strategy
works well even in the most general ""one-shot"" regime, where we are given a
single instance of a channel and wish to determine the maximal number of bits
that can be communicated up to a small failure probability. This result follows
by generalizing a non-commutative union bound to apply for a sequence of
general measurements. We also demonstrate two ways in which a receiver can
recover a state close to the original state after it has been decoded by a
sequence of measurements that each succeed with high probability. The second of
these methods will be useful in realizing an efficient decoder for fully

time with a complex covariance structure is introduced in a context of
quantitative genetic applications. The methods introduced can be used in many
applications in quantitative genetics although the discussion presented
concentrates on longevity studies. The framework presented allows to combine
models based on continuous time with models based on discrete time in a joint
analysis. The continuous time models are approximations of the frailty model in
which the hazard function will be assumed to be piece-wise constant. The
discrete time models used are multivariate variants of the discrete relative
risk models. These models allow for regular parametric likelihood-based
inference by exploring a coincidence of their likelihood functions and the
likelihood functions of suitably defined multivariate generalized linear mixed
models. The models include a dispersion parameter, which is essential for
obtaining a decomposition of the variance of the trait of interest as a sum of
parcels representing the additive genetic effects, environmental effects and
unspecified sources of variability; as required in quantitative genetic
applications. The methods presented are implemented in such a way that large
and complex quantitative genetic data can be analyzed.

evidence for an anti-correlation; low-mass passive galaxies appear, on average,

observed by two transmitters. One of the transmitters may send a possibly
private message to the other transmitter in a cooperation phase before both
transmitters communicate to the receiver. For this network configuration this
paper investigates both a function computation setup, wherein the receiver
wants to compute a given function of the sources exactly, and a rate distortion
setup, wherein the receiver wants to compute a given function within some
distortion.
  For the function computation setup, a general inner bound to the rate region
is established and shown to be tight in a number of cases: partially invertible
functions, full cooperation between transmitters, one-round point-to-point
communication, two-round point-to-point communication, and the cascade setup
where the transmitters and the receiver are aligned. In particular it is shown
that the ratio of the total number of transmitted bits without cooperation and
the total number of transmitted bits with cooperation can be arbitrarily large.
Furthermore, one bit of cooperation suffices to arbitrarily reduce the amount
of information both transmitters need to convey to the receiver.
  For the rate distortion version, an inner bound to the rate region is
exhibited which always includes, and sometimes strictly, the convex hull of
Kaspi-Berger's related inner bounds. The strict inclusion is shown via two
examples.

Though extremely powerful, the resulting fixed-point tensors were mathematical
abstractions and thus lacked a physical interpretation. As a result it was hard
to judge if two different fixed-point tensors described the same quantum phase

clustering of galaxies and help interpret the results of galaxy redshift
surveys. However, the galaxy properties predicted from N-body simulations are
not necessarily representative of the observed galaxy populations; for example,
theoretical uncertainties arise from the absence of baryons in N-body
simulations. In this work, we assess how the uncertainties in N-body
simulations impact the cosmological parameters inferred from galaxy redshift
surveys. Applying the halo model framework, we find that the velocity bias of
galaxies in modeling the redshift-space distortions is likely to be the
predominant source of systematic bias. For a deep, wide survey like BigBOSS,
current 10 per cent uncertainties in the velocity bias limit k_max to 0.14
h/Mpc. In contrast, we find that the uncertainties related to the density
profiles and the galaxy occupation statistics lead to relatively insignificant
systematic biases. Therefore, the ability to calibrate the velocity bias
accurately -- from observations as well as simulations -- will likely set the
ultimate limit on the smallest length scale that can be used to infer
cosmological information from galaxy clustering.

samples, electron-electron interactions were recently shown to produce
surprising patterns of symmetry breaking and phase transitions in the integer
quantum Hall regime. Although a series of robust fractional quantum Hall states
was also recently observed in graphene, their rich phase diagram and tunability
have yet to be fully explored. Here we report local electronic compressibility
measurements of ultraclean suspended graphene that reveal a multitude of
fractional quantum Hall states surrounding filling factors v = -1/2 and -1/4.
In several of these states, we observe phase transitions that indicate abrupt
changes in the underlying order and are marked by a narrow region of negative
compressibility that cuts across the incompressible peak. Remarkably, as
filling factor approaches v = -1/2, we observe additional oscillations in
compressibility that appear to be related to the phase transitions and persist
to within 2.5% of v = -1/2. We use a simple model based on crossing Landau
levels of composite particles with different internal degrees of freedom to
explain many qualitative features of the experimental data. Our results add to
the diverse array of correlated states observed in graphene and demonstrate
substantial control over their order parameters, showing that graphene serves

matter cosmologies with a free streaming cutoff have been performed with
cosmological particle-based simulations, but they all suffer from spurious
structure formation at scales below their respective free streaming scales --
i.e. where the physics of halo formation is most affected by free streaming. We
perform a series of high resolution numerical simulations of different WDM
models, and develop an approximate method to subtract artificial structures in
the measured halo mass function. The corrected measurements are then used to
construct and calibrate an extended Press-Schechter (EPS) model with sharp-$k$
window function and adequate mass assignment. The EPS model gives accurate
predictions for the low redshift halo mass function of CDM and WDM models, but
it significantly under-predicts the halo abundance at high redshifts. By taking
into account the ellipticity of the initial patches and connecting the
characteristic filter scale to the smallest ellipsoidal axis, we are able to
eliminate this inconsistency and obtain an accurate mass function over all
redshifts and all dark matter particle masses covered by the simulations. As an
additional application we use our model to predict the microhalo abundance of
the standard neutralino-CDM scenario and we give the first quantitative
prediction of the mass function over the full range of scales of CDM structure
formation.

Halpha3 which provides the complete census of the recent star-forming, HI-rich
galaxies in the local universe, we aim to investigate the structural parameters
of both the young (<10 Myr) and the old (>1 Gyr) stellar populations. By
comparing the sizes of these stellar components we investigated the spatial
scale on which galaxies are growing at the present cosmological epoch and the
role of the environment in quenching the star-formation activity. We computed
the concentration, asymmetry, and clumpiness structural parameters. To quantify
the sizes we computed half-light radii and a new parameter dubbed EW/r. The
concentration index computed in the r band depends on the stellar mass and on
the Hubble type, these variables being related since most massive galaxies are
bulge dominated thus most concentrated. Going toward later spirals and
irregulars both the concentration index and the stellar mass decrease. Blue
Compact dwarfs represent an exception since they have similar stellar mass but
they are more concentrated than dwarf irregulars. The asymmetry and the
clumpiness increase along the spiral sequence then they decrease going into the
dwarf regime, where the light distribution is smooth and more symmetric. When
measured on Halpha images, the CAS parameters do not exhibit obvious
correlations with Hubble type. We found that the concentration index is the
main parameter that describes the current growth of isolated galaxies but, for
a fixed concentration, the stellar mass plays a second order role. At the
present epoch, massive galaxies are growing inside-out, conversely the dwarfs
are growing on the scale of their already assembled mass.

requires a good estimate of the foreground column density of photoelectric
absorbing species. Assuming uniform elemental abundances this reduces to having
a good estimate of the total hydrogen column density, N(Htot)=N(HI)+2N(H2). The
atomic component, N(HI), is reliably provided using the mapped 21 cm radio
emission but estimating the molecular hydrogen column density, N(H2), expected
for any particular direction, is difficult. The X-ray afterglows of GRBs are
ideal sources to probe X-ray absorption in our Galaxy because they are
extragalactic, numerous, bright, have simple spectra and occur randomly across
the entire sky. We describe an empirical method, utilizing 493 afterglows
detected by the Swift XRT, to determine N(Htot) through the Milky Way which
provides an improved estimate of the X-ray absorption in our Galaxy and thereby
leads to more reliable measurements of the intrinsic X-ray absorption and,
potentially, other spectral parameters, for extragalactic X-ray sources. We
derive a simple function, dependent on the product of the atomic hydrogen
column density, N(HI), and dust extinction, E(B-V), which describes the
variation of the molecular hydrogen column density, N(H2), of our Galaxy, over
the sky. Using the resulting N(Htot) we show that the dust-to-hydrogen ratio is
correlated with the carbon monoxide emission and use this ratio to estimate the
fraction of material which forms interstellar dust grains. Our resulting recipe
represents a significant revision in Galactic absorption compared to previous
standard methods, particularly at low Galactic latitudes.

galaxy of the GRB itself. There is an apparent correlation between the
equivalent column density of hydrogen, N(H,intrinsic) (assuming it to be at the
GRB redshift), and redshift, z, with the few z>6 GRBs showing the greatest
intrinsic column densities. We investigate the N(H,intrinsic) - z relation
using a large sample of Swift GRBs, as well as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and
quasar samples, paying particular attention to the spectral energy
distributions of the two highest redshift GRBs. Various possible sample biases
and systematics that might produce such a correlation are considered, and we
conclude that the correlation is very likely to be real. This may indicate
either an evolutionary effect in the host galaxy properties, or a contribution
from gas along the line-of-sight, in the diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM) or
intervening absorbing clouds. Employing a more realistic model for IGM
absorption than in previous works, we find that this may explain much of the
observed opacity at z>~3 providing it is not too hot, likely between 10^5 K and
10^6.5 K, and moderately metal enriched, Z~0.2 Z_sun. This material could
therefore constitute the Warm Hot Intergalactic Medium. However, a comparable
level of absorption is also expected from the cumulative effect of intervening
cold gas clouds, and given current uncertainties it is not possible to say
which, if either, dominates. At lower redshifts, we conclude that gas in the
host galaxies must be the dominant contributor to the observed X-ray
absorption.

fermions, the fractional level WZW model on SL(2;R) at level -1/2 and the WZW
model on the Lie supergroup GL(1|1). It concludes with a general discussion of
the so-called staggered modules that give these theories their logarithmic
structure, before outlining a proposed strategy to understand more general
logarithmic conformal field theories. Throughout, the emphasis is on continuum
methods and their generalisation from the familiar rational case. In
particular, the modular properties of the characters of the spectrum play a
central role and Verlinde formulae are evaluated with the results compared to
the known fusion rules. Moreover, bulk modular invariants are constructed, the
structures of the corresponding bulk state spaces are elucidated, and a
formalism for computing correlation functions is discussed.

4-manifolds which support a fixed-point free smooth (resp. locally linear)
$S^1$-action and realize the given group as the fundamental group. A similar
statement holds for the number of equivalence classes of fixed-point free
$S^1$-actions under some further conditions on the fundamental group. The
connection between the classification of the $S^1$-manifolds and the
fundamental group is given by a certain decomposition, called fiber-sum
decomposition, of the $S^1$-manifolds. More concretely, each fiber-sum
decomposition naturally gives rise to a Z-splitting of the fundamental group.
There are two technical results in this paper which play a central role in our
considerations. One states that the Z-splitting is a canonical JSJ
decomposition of the fundamental group in the sense of Rips and Sela. Another
asserts that if the fundamental group has infinite center, then the homotopy
class of principal orbits of any fixed-point free $S^1$-action on the
4-manifold must be infinite, unless the 4-manifold is the mapping torus of a
periodic diffeomorphism of some elliptic 3-manifold. The paper ends with two
questions concerning the topological nature of the smooth classification and
the Seiberg-Witten invariants of 4-manifolds admitting a smooth fixed-point

re-fit each diluted light curve model to the light curve. The resulting

Theory, is a criterion for a ring to have a semisimple left quotient ring. The
aim of the paper is to give four new criteria (using a completely different
approach and new ideas). The first one is based on the recent fact that for an
arbitrary ring $R$ the set $\CM$ of maximal left denominator sets of $R$ is a
non-empty set:
  Theorem (The First Criterion). A ring $R$ has a semisimple left quotient ring
$Q$ iff $\CM $ is a finite set, $\bigcap_{S\in \CM} \ass (S) =0$ and, for each
$S\in \CM$, the ring $S^{-1}R$ is a simple left Artinian ring. In this case,
$Q\simeq \prod_{S\in \CM} S^{-1}R$.
  The Second Criterion is given via the minimal primes of $R$ and goes further
then the First one %and Goldie's Theorem in the sense that it describes
explicitly the maximal left denominator sets $S$ via the minimal primes of $R$.
The Third Criterion is close to Goldie's Criterion but it is easier to check in
applications (basically, it reduces Goldie's Theorem to the prime case). The
Fourth Criterion is given via certain left denominator sets.

scientists have developed influential theories about the role of network

studies, which examined how individuals leverage their social networks for
competitive advantage, such as a new job or higher compensation. It is not
clear how these theories generalize to online networks, which differ from
real-world social networks in important respects, including asymmetry of social
links. We address this problem by analyzing how users of the social news
aggregator Digg adopt stories recommended by friends, i.e., users they follow.
We measure the impact different factors, such as network position and activity
rate; have on access to novel information, which in Digg's case means set of
distinct news stories. We show that a user can improve his information access
by linking to active users, though this becomes less effective as the number of
friends, or their activity, grows due to structural network constraints. These
constraints arise because users in structurally diverse position within the
follower graph have topically diverse interests from their friends. Moreover,
though in most cases user's friends are exposed to almost all the information
available in the network, after they make their recommendations, the user sees
only a small fraction of the available information. Our study suggests that
cognitive and structural bottlenecks limit access to novel information in
online social networks.

consequence of tides on the orbits, but it results from a secular forcing of
the inner planet's flattening. We then conclude that these hierarchical

program size to psychology by implementing a concrete language of thought with
Turing-computable Kolmogorov complexity (LT^2C^2) satisfying the following
requirements: 1) to be simple enough so that the complexity of any given finite
binary sequence can be computed, 2) to be based on tangible operations of human
reasoning (printing, repeating,...), 3) to be sufficiently powerful to generate
all possible sequences but not too powerful as to identify regularities which
would be invisible to humans. We first formalize LT^2C^2, giving its syntax and
semantics and defining an adequate notion of program size. Our setting leads to
a Kolmogorov complexity function relative to LT^2C^2 which is computable in
polynomial time, and it also induces a prediction algorithm in the spirit of
Solomonoff's inductive inference theory. We then prove the efficacy of this
language by investigating regularities in strings produced by participants
attempting to generate random strings. Participants had a profound
understanding of randomness and hence avoided typical misconceptions such as
exaggerating the number of alternations. We reasoned that remaining
regularities would express the algorithmic nature of human thoughts, revealed
in the form of specific patterns. Kolmogorov complexity relative to LT^2C^2
passed three expected tests examined here: 1) human sequences were less complex
than control PRNG sequences, 2) human sequences were not stationary, showing
decreasing values of complexity resulting from fatigue, 3) each individual
showed traces of algorithmic stability since fitting of partial sequences was
more effective to predict subsequent sequences than average fits. This work

of freedom (3D), in order to study and reveal the character of the orbits of
the stars, in a binary stellar system composed of a primary quiet or active
galaxy and a small satellite companion galaxy. Our main dynamical analysis will
be focused on the behavior of the primary galaxy. We investigate in detail the
regular or chaotic nature of motion, in two different cases: (i) the
time-independent model in both 2D and 3D dynamical systems and (ii) the
time-evolving 3D model. Our numerical calculations indicate that the percentage
of the chaotic orbits increases when the primary galaxy has a dense and massive
nucleus. The presence of the dense galactic core also increases the stellar
velocities near the center of the galaxy. Moreover, for small values of the
distance R between the two bodies, low-energy stars display chaotic motion,
near the central region of the galaxy, while for larger values of the distance
R, the motion in active galaxies is entirely regular for low-energy stars. Our
simulations suggest that in galaxies with a satellite companion, the chaotic
nature of motion is not only a result of the galactic interaction between the
primary galaxy and its companion, but also a result caused by the presence of
the dense nucleus in the core of the primary galaxy. Theoretical arguments are
presented in order to support and interpret the numerically derived outcomes.
Furthermore, we follow the 3D evolution of the primary galaxy, when mass is
transported adiabatically from the disk to the nucleus. Our numerical results
are in satisfactory agreement with observational data obtained from the
M51-type binary stellar systems. A comparison between the present research and
similar and earlier work is also made.

is associated with up-regulation of gt1 expression in the nodal plexus. Given
that maize does not initiate secondary ear buds, the expression of gt1 in the

interior ocean, but competing hypotheses differ over whether spectral
observations from the Galileo spacecraft show the signature of ocean evaporates
or simply surface radiation products unrelated to the interior. Using adaptive
optics at the W.M. Keck Observatory, we have obtained spatially resolved
spectra of most of the disk of Europa at a spectral resolution ~40 times higher
than seen by the Galileo spacecraft. These spectra show a previously undetected
distinct signature of magnesium sulfate salts on Europa, but the magnesium
sulfate is confined to the trailing hemisphere and spatially correlated with
the presence of radiation products like sulfuric acid and SO2. On the leading,
less irradiated, hemisphere, our observations rule out the presence of many of
the proposed sulfate salts, but do show the presence of distorted water ice
bands. Based on the association of the potential MgSO4, detection on the
trailing side with other radiation products, we conclude that MgSO4 is also a
radiation product, rather than a constituent of a Europa ocean brine. Based on
ocean chemistry models, we hypothesize that, prior to irradiation, magnesium is
primarily in the form of MgCl2, and we predict that NaCl and KCl are even more
abundant, and, in fact, dominate the non-ice component of the leading
hemisphere. We propose observational tests of this new hypothesis.

relaxation timescales exceeding the Hubble time and testing the IMF
universality hypothesis. We provide two versions of the technique: (1) a fully
unconstrained determination of the age, metallicity, and $\alpha_1$ and (2) a
constrained fitting by imposing the externally determined mass-to-light ratio
of the stellar population. We have tested our approach by Monte-Carlo
simulations using mock spectra and conclude that: (a) age, metallicity and
$\alpha_1$ can be precisely determined by applying the unconstrained version of
the code to high signal-to-noise datasets (S/N=100, R=7000 yield $\Delta
\alpha_1 \approx 0.1$); (b) the $M/L$ constraint significantly improves the
precision and reduces the degeneracies, however its systematic errors will
cause biased $\alpha_1$ estimates; (c) standard Lick indices cannot constrain
the PDMF because they miss most of the mass function sensitive spectral
features; (d) the $\alpha_1$ determination remains unaffected by the high-mass
IMF shape ($\alpha_3$; $M_* \ge 1 M_{\odot}$) variation for stellar systems
older than 8 Gyr, while the intermediate-mass IMF slope ($\alpha_2$; $0.5 \le
M_* < 1 M_{\odot}$) may introduce biases into the best-fitting $\alpha_1$
values if it is different from the canonical value $\alpha_2 = 2.3$. We

correlations with respect to the event plane in Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV.
The charge multiplicity asymmetries between the up/down and left/right
hemispheres relative to the event plane are utilized. The contributions from
statistical fluctuations and detector effects were subtracted from the
(co-)variance of the observed charge multiplicity asymmetries. In the mid- to
most-central collisions, the same- (opposite-) sign pairs are preferentially
emitted in back-to-back (aligned on the same-side) directions. The charge
separation across the event plane, measured by the difference, $\Delta$,
between the like- and unlike-sign up/down $-$ left/right correlations, is
largest near the event plane. The difference is found to be proportional to the
event-by-event final-state particle ellipticity (via the observed second-order
harmonic $v^{\rm obs}_{2}$), where $\Delta=(1.3\pm1.4({\rm

selective pressures, such as the application of pesticides and the presence of
pathogens. When rapid adaptation is driven by rare alleles from the standing
genetic variation or by a high population rate of de novo adaptive mutation,
positive selection should commonly generate soft rather that hard selective
sweeps. In a soft sweep, multiple adaptive haplotypes sweep through the
population simultaneously, in contrast to hard sweeps in which only a single
adaptive haplotype rises to high frequency. Current statistical methods were
not designed to detect soft sweeps, and are therefore likely to miss these
possibly numerous adaptive events. Here, we develop a statistical test (H12)
based on haplotype homozygosity that is capable of detecting both hard and soft
sweeps with similar power. We use H12 to identify multiple genomic regions that
have undergone recent and strong adaptation in a population sample of fully
sequenced Drosophila melanogaster strains from the Drosophila Genetic Reference
Panel (DGRP). Visual inspection of the top 50 peaks revealed that multiple
haplotypes are at high frequency, consistent with signatures of soft sweep. We
developed a second statistic (H2/H1) that is sensitive to signatures common to
soft sweeps but not hard sweeps, in order to determine whether sweeps detected
by H12 can be more easily generated by hard versus soft sweeps. Surprisingly,
we find that the H12 and H2/H1 values for all top 50 peaks are more easily
generated by soft sweeps than hard sweeps under several evolutionary scenarios.

momenta and Hamiltonian to the extent possible. On the other, on the curved
surface, we have no exact Cartesian coordinate system within intrinsic

canonical quantization is attainable. Since the minimum surfaces, catenoid and
helicoid studied in this paper, have vanishing mean curvature, we explore
whether the intrinsic geometry offers a proper framework in which the quantum
theory can be established in a self-consistent way. Results show that it does
for quantum motions on catenoid and it does not for that on helicoid, but
neither is compatible with Schr\""odinger theory. In contrast, in

structure and chemical properties of gold nanoparticles. Different structural
families of clusters are compared. For up to 60 atoms we optimize structures
using DFT-based simulated annealing. Cluster geometries are found to distort
considerably, creating large band gaps at the Fermi level. For up to 200 atoms
we consider structures generated with a simple EMT potential and clusters based
on cuboctahedra and icosahedra. All types of cluster geometry exhibit
jellium-like electronic shell structure. We calculate adsorption energies of
several atoms on the cuboctahedral clusters. Adsorption energies are found to
vary abruptly at magic numbers. Using a Newns-Anderson model we find that the
effect of magic numbers on adsorption energy can be understood from the
location of adsorbate-induced states with respect to the cluster Fermi level.

dimensional (AF) if and only if the graph $E$ has no loops. In this paper we
consider the question of when a labeled graph $C^*$-algebra $C^*(E,\CL,\CB)$ is
AF. A notion of loop in a labeled space $(E,\CL,\CB)$ is defined when $\CB$ is
the smallest one among the accommodating sets that are closed under relative
complements and it is proved that if a labeled graph $C^*$-algebra is AF, the
labeled space has no loops. A sufficient condition for a labeled space to be
associated to AF algebra is also given. For graph $C^*$-algebras $C^*(E)$, this
sufficient condition is also a necessary one. Besides, we discuss other
equivalent conditions for a graph $C^*$-algebra to be AF in the setting of
labeled graphs and prove that these conditions are not always equivalent by
invoking various examples.

linear chains with restricted orientations relative to the substrate has been
studied. In the model considered here, which is known as self-assembled rigid
rods (SAARs) model, the surface is represented by a twodimensional lattice and
a continuous orientational transition occurs as a function of temperature and
coverage. The phase diagrams were obtained for the square, triangular and
honeycomb lattices by means of Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling
analysis. The numerical results were compared with Bethe-Peierls analytical
predictions about the orientational transition for the square and triangular
lattices. The analysis of the phase diagrams, along with the behavior of the
critical average rod lengths, showed that the critical properties of the model
do not depend on the structure of the lattice at low temperatures (coverage),
revealing a one-dimensional behavior in this regime. Finally, the universality
class of the SAARs model, which has been subject of controversy, has been
revisited.

grow over time? We address this question by analysing the history of dark
matter subhaloes in the Millennium-II cosmological simulation. A semi-analytic
model serves as the link to observations. We argue that a reasonable analogue
to early morphological types or red-sequence dwarf galaxies are those subhaloes
that experienced strong mass loss, or alternatively those that have spent a
long time in massive haloes. This approach reproduces well the observed
morphology-distance relation of dwarf galaxies in the Virgo and Coma clusters,
and thus provides insight into their history. Over their lifetime, present-day
late types have experienced an amount of environmental influence similar to
what the progenitors of dwarf ellipticals had already experienced at redshifts
above two. Therefore, dwarf ellipticals are more likely to be a result of early
and continuous environmental influence in group- and cluster-size haloes,
rather than a recent transformation product. The observed morphological
sequences of late-type and early-type galaxies have developed in parallel, not
consecutively. Consequently, the characteristics of today's late-type galaxies
are not necessarily representative for the progenitors of today's dwarf
ellipticals. Studies aiming to reproduce the present-day dwarf population thus
need to start at early epochs, model the influence of various environments, and
also take into account the evolution of the environments themselves.

resources, and has great application prospects in future network
communications. However, the properties of network coding also make the
pollution attack more serious. In this paper, we give an unconditional secure
authentication scheme for network coding based on a linear code $C$.
Safavi-Naini and Wang gave an authentication code for multi-receivers and
multiple messages. We notice that the scheme of Safavi-Naini and Wang is
essentially constructed with Reed-Solomon codes. And we modify their
construction slightly to make it serve for authenticating subspace codes over
linear network. Also, we generalize the construction with linear codes. The
generalization to linear codes has the similar advantages as generalizing
Shamir's secret sharing scheme to linear secret sharing sceme based on linear
codes. One advantage of this generalization is that for a fixed message space,
our scheme allows arbitrarily many receivers to check the integrity of their
own messages, while the scheme with Reed-Solomon codes has a constraint on the
number of verifying receivers. Another advantage is that we introduce access
structure in the generalized scheme. Massey characterized the access structure
of linear secret sharing scheme by minimal codewords in the dual code whose
first component is 1. We slightly modify the definition of minimal codewords.
Let $C$ be a $[V,k]$ linear code. For any coordinate $i\in \{1,2,\cdots,V\}$, a
codeword $\vec{c}$ in $C$ is called minimal respect to $i$ if the codeword
$\vec{c}$ has component 1 at the $i$-th coordinate and there is no other
codeword whose $i$-th component is 1 with support strictly contained in that of
$\vec{c}$. Then the security of receiver $R_i$ in our authentication scheme is
characterized by the minimal codewords respect to $i$ in the dual code
$C^\bot$.

heat flux is limited to $q_\parallel/q_0 \sim 0.3$, independent of mean free

these results that is consistent with a local radial electron temperature

an extra singlet scalar of the mass around 125GeV that slightly mixes with the
SM Higgs heavier than 600GeV. When this scalar has a vacuum expectation value
well beyond the electroweak scale, it can be identified as a linearly realized

linear function to the measured correlation and derive the slope parameter
b(\lambda)= \Delta S_\nu(\lambda) / \Delta S_\nu(100um) of the best-fit linear
function. Compiling a sample by combining our b(\lambda) and published ones, we
show that the b(\lambda) strength varies from cloud to cloud by a factor of 4.
Finding that b(\lambda) decreases as S_\nu(100um) increases in the sample, we
suggest that a non-linear correlation including a quadratic term of
S_\nu(100um)^2 should be fitted to the measured correlation. The variation of
optical depth, which is A_V = 0.16 - 2.0 in the sample, can change b(\lambda)
by a factor of 2 - 3. There would be some contribution to the large b(\lambda)
variation from the forward-scattering characteristic of dust grains which is
coupled to the non-isotropic interstellar radiation field (ISRF). Models of the
scattering of diffuse Galactic light (DGL) underestimate the b(\lambda) values
by a factor of 2. This could be reconciled by deficiency in UV photons in the
ISRF or by a moderate increase in dust albedo. Our b(\lambda) spectrum favors a
contribution from extended red emission (ERE) to the diffuse optical light;
b(\lambda) rises from B to V faster than the models, seems to peak around 6000
\AA, and decreases towards long wavelengths. Such a characteristic is expected
from the models in which the DGL is combined with ERE.

multiple-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann method with the Galilean-invariant
momentum exchange method. The lateral migration and equilibrium of the particle
are similar to the Segr\'e-Silberberg effect in our numerical simulations.
Surprisingly, two lateral equilibrium positions are observed corresponding to
the releasing positions of the biconcave particle. The upper equilibrium
positions significantly decrease with the growth of the Reynolds number,
whereas the lower ones are almost insensitive to the Reynolds number.
Interestingly, the regular wave accompanied by nonuniform rotation is exhibited
in the lateral movement of the biconcave particle. It can be attributed to that
the biconcave shape in various postures interacts with the parabolic velocity
distribution of the Poiseuille flow. A set of contours illustrate the dynamic
flow field when the biconcave particle has successive postures in a rotating
period.

Msun and M2 = 0.143 (0.006) Msun (mass ratio 0.27), and radii of R1 = 0.51
(0.01) Rsun and R2 = 0.174 (0.006) Rsun. This puts the companion in a very
sparsely sampled and important late M-dwarf mass-regime. Since both stars share
the same age and metallicity and straddle the theoretical boundary between
fully and partially convective stellar interiors, a comparison can be made to
model predictions over a large range of M-dwarf masses using the same model
isochrone. Both stars appear to have a slightly inflated radius compared to 1
Gyr model predictions for their masses, but future work is needed to properly
account for the effects of star spots on the light curve solution. A
significant, subsynchronous, ~2.56 d signal with ~2% peak-to-peak amplitude is
detected in the WFCAM light curve, which we attribute to rotational modulation
of cool star spots. We propose that the subsynchronous rotation is either due
to a stable star-spot complex at high latitude on the (magnetically active)
primary (i.e. differential rotation), or to additional magnetic braking, or to
interaction of the binary with a third body or circumbinary disk during its

This conjecture has been solved for operators having at most double

following topological representation. There is a separable metrizable space
$X$, a $\sigma$-ideal $I$ on $X$ and a dense countable subset $D$ of $X$ such
that the ideal consists of those subsets of $D$ whose closure belongs to $I$.
It turns out that this definition is indepedent of the choice of $D$. We show
that an ideal is of this form if and only if it is dense and countably
separated. The latter is a variation of a notion introduced by Todor\vcevi\'c
for gaps. As a corollary, we get that this class is invariant under the
Rudin--Blass equivalence. This also implies that the space $X$ can be always
chosen to be compact so that $I$ is a $\sigma$-ideal of compact sets. We
compute the possible descriptive complexities of such ideals and conclude that
all analytic equivalence relations induced by such ideals are
$\mathbf{\Pi}^0_3$. We also prove that a coanalytic ideal is an intersection of

reduce the number of infected. The question which individuals should be
immunized in order to mitigate the impact of the virus on the rest of
population has received quite some attention in the literature. The dynamics of
the of a virus spread through a population is often represented as information
spread over a complex network. The strategies commonly proposed to determine
which nodes are to be selected for immunization often involve only one
centrality measure at a time, while often the topology of the network seems to
suggest that a single metric is insufficient to capture the influence of a node
entirely.
  In this work we present a generic method based on a genetic algorithm (GA)
which does not rely explicitly on any centrality measures during its search but
only exploits this type of information to narrow the search space. The fitness
of an individual is defined as the estimated expected number of infections of a
virus following SIR dynamics. The proposed method is evaluated on two contact
networks: the Goodreau's Faux Mesa high school and the US air transportation
network. The GA method manages to outperform the most common strategies based
on a single metric for the air transportation network and its performance is
comparable with the best performing strategy for the high school network.

targeted the known transiting planet WASP-19b in order to try to detect its
secondary transits in the visible. This is made possible by the excellent
sub-millimagnitude precision of the binned data. The WASP-19 system was
observed during 24 nights in May 2010. The photometric variability level due to
starspots is about 1.8% (peak-to-peak), in line with the SuperWASP data from
2007 (1.4%) and larger than in 2008 (0.07%). We find a rotation period of
WASP-19 of 10.7 +/- 0.5 days, in agreement with the SuperWASP determination of
10.5 +/- 0.2 days. Theoretical models show that this can only be explained if
tidal dissipation in the star is weak, i.e. the tidal dissipation factor Q'star
> 3.10^7. Separately, we find evidence for a secondary eclipse of depth 390 +/-
190 ppm with a 2.0 sigma significance, a phase consistent with a circular orbit
and a 3% false positive probability. Given the wavelength range of the
observations (420 to 950 nm), the secondary transit depth translates into a day
side brightness temperature of 2690(-220/+150) K, in line with measurements in
the z' and K bands. The day side emission observed in the visible could be due
either to thermal emission of an extremely hot day side with very little
redistribution of heat to the night side, or to direct reflection of stellar
light with a maximum geometrical albedo Ag=0.27 +/- 0.13. We also report a
low-frequency oscillation well in phase at the planet orbital period, but with
a lower-limit amplitude that could not be attributed to the planet phase alone,
and possibly contaminated with residual lightcurve trends.

oscillations and the increase in the density within the traps caused by the

tests possible for Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). Spitzer 3.6 micron
photometry fixes the bulge parameterisation and strongly constrains the
properties of the sub-dominant stellar disk. Furthermore, the distance is known
to better than 5 percent, virtually eliminating it as a free parameter. The
rotation curve is easily measured, since the H I (and stellar) disks are edge
on, and both the receding and approaching sides agree very well. In this paper
we explore the agreement between the model and observed rotation curves in MOND
given that the only two free parameters available are the mass-to-light ratios
of the bulge and disk. We use a grid based MOND Poisson solver that accurately
solves for the MOND gravity and produces our model rotation curves from a given
mass distribution. The input to the Poisson solver is a 3D distribution of N
particles which is generated from modelling the observed distribution of stars
and gas in the galaxy. By ensuring a superior fit to the radial surface
brightness profile than previous works, by virtue of a double Sersic fit to the
bulge, we were able to produce excellent fits to the rotation curve with
typical values for both mass-to-light ratios. We conclude that the model
rotation curve of a mass distribution in MOND is extremely sensitive to the
bulge-disk decomposition and even slight deviation from the observed mass
distribution can produce large differences in the model rotation curve.

interactions to particular systems of physical interest. We consider repulsive
and attractive power-law potentials of interaction r^{-\gamma} with \gamma<d in
a space of dimension d. For \gamma>\gamma_c= (d-1)/2, strong collisions must be
taken into account and the evolution of the system is governed by the Boltzmann
equation or by a modified Landau equation; for \gamma<\gamma_c, strong
collisions are negligible and the evolution of the system is governed by the
Lenard-Balescu equation. In the marginal case \gamma=\gamma_c, we can use the
Landau equation (with appropriately justified cut-offs) as a relevant
approximation of the Boltzmann and Lenard-Balescu equations. The divergence at
small scales that appears in the original Landau equation is regularized by the
effect of strong collisions. In the case of repulsive interactions with a
neutralizing background (e.g. plasmas), the divergence at large scales that
appears in the original Landau equation is regularized by collective effects
accounting for Debye shielding. In the case of attractive interactions (e.g.
gravity), it is regularized by the spatial inhomogeneity of the system and its
finite extent. We provide explicit analytical expressions of the diffusion and
friction coefficients, and of the relaxation time, depending on the value of
the exponent \gamma and on the dimension of space d. We treat in a unified
framework the case of Coulombian plasmas and stellar systems in various
dimensions of space, and the case of the attractive and repulsive HMF models.

typically on the fly, verifies conformance of the system's behavior to the
specified property is called a monitor. Nowadays, a variety of formalisms are
used to express properties on observed behavior of computer systems, and a lot
of methods have been proposed to construct monitors. However, it is a frequent
situation when advanced formalisms and methods are not needed, because an
executable model of the system is available. The original purpose and structure
of the model are out of importance; rather what is required is that the system
and its model have similar sets of interfaces. In this case, monitoring is
carried out as follows. Two ""black boxes"", the system and its reference model,
are executed in parallel and stimulated with the same input sequences; the
monitor dynamically captures their output traces and tries to match them. The
main problem is that a model is usually more abstract than the real system,
both in terms of functionality and timing. Therefore, trace-to-trace matching
is not straightforward and allows the system to produce events in different
order or even miss some of them. The paper studies on-the-fly conformance
relations for timed systems (i.e., systems whose inputs and outputs are
distributed along the time axis). It also suggests a practice-oriented
methodology for creating and configuring monitors for timed systems based on
executable models. The methodology has been successfully applied to a number of
industrial projects of simulation-based hardware verification.

intense CO emission occurs in a partial ring with ~230pc radius around the

diffuse molecular gas. We resolve 10 GMAs in the ring which has an integrated
molecular mass of ~8x10^8M_sun. Our observations filter out a large part of the
CO(1-0) emission mapped at shorter spacings, indicating that most of the
molecular gas is diffuse and that GMAs only exist near and within the
circumnuclear ring. The molecular ring is uneven with most of the mass on the
western side, which also contains GMAs extending into a pronounced tidal dust
lane. The spatial and kinematic patterns suggest that the northwest extension
of the ring is a cosmic umbilical cord that is feeding molecular gas associated
with the dust lane and tidal debris into the nuclear ring. The astrophysical
process for producing a ring structure is not fully understood, but the
presence of numerous GMAs suggests an orbit crowding or resonance phenomenon.
There is some evidence that star formation is progressing radially outwards

these processes.

interferometric, and parallax measurements. The values found were taken as
reference to which we compare the values derived by spectroscopic methods. Our
analysis leads us to conclude that the spectroscopic methods considered in this

HD\,71297 has chemical abundances not compatible with the previous spectral
classification. We found moderate underabundances of carbon, sodium, magnesium,

between the correlations and the phase-response curve (PRC) of the oscillator,
proves anti-correlations between neighboring intervals for adapting neurons

features in the cosmic matter distribution by 3d weak lensing. Baryon
oscillations are inaccessible even to weak lensing tomography because of wide
line-of-sight weighting functions and require a specialized approach via 3d
shear estimates. We quantify the uncertainty of estimating the matter spectrum
amplitude at the baryon oscillations wave vectors by a Fisher-matrix approach
with a fixed cosmology and show in this way that future weak lensing surveys
such as EUCLID and DES are able to pick up the first four wiggles, with EUCLID
giving a better precision in the measurement. We also provide a detailed
investigation of the correlation existing between errors and of their scaling
behavior with respect to survey parameters such as median redshift, error on
redshift, error on the galaxy shape measurement, sky coverage, and finally with
respect to the number of wiggles one is trying to determine.

non-trivial prefixes of codewords and the set of non-trivial suffices of
codewords are disjoint. These codes were first studied by Levenshtein in 1964,
motivated by applications in synchronisation. More recently these codes were
independently invented (under the name \emph{cross-bifix-free} codes) by
Baji\'c and Stojanovi\'c.
  We provide a simple construction for a class of non-overlapping codes which
has optimal cardinality whenever $n$ divides $q$. Moreover, for all parameters
$n$ and $q$ we show that a code from this class is close to optimal, in the
sense that it has cardinality within a constant factor of an upper bound due to
Levenshtein from 1970. Previous constructions have cardinality within a
constant factor of the upper bound only when $q$ is fixed.
  Chee, Kiah, Purkayastha and Wang showed that a $q$-ary length $n$
non-overlapping code contains at most $q^n/(2n-1)$ codewords; this bound is
weaker than the Levenshtein bound. Their proof appealed to the application in
synchronisation: we provide a direct combinatorial argument to establish the
bound of Chee \emph{et al}.
  We also consider codes of short length, finding the leading term of the
maximal cardinality of a non-overlapping code when $n$ is fixed and
$q\rightarrow \infty$. The largest cardinality of non-overlapping codes of
lengths $3$ or less is determined exactly.

and island size distributions (ISDs) in reversible submonolayer growth was
studied using the Clarke-Vvedensky model. An approach based on rate-equation
results for irreversible aggregation (IA) models is extended to predict several
scaling regimes in square and triangular lattices, in agreement with simulation
results. Consistently with previous works, a regime I with fractal islands is
observed at low temperatures, corresponding to IA with critical island size
i=1, and a crossover to a second regime appears as the temperature is increased
to \epsilon R^{2/3} ~ 1, where \epsilon is the single bond detachment
probability and R is the diffusion-to-deposition ratio. In the square
(triangular) lattice, a regime with scaling similar to IA with i=3 (i=2) is
observed after that crossover. In the triangular lattice, a subsequent
crossover to an IA regime with i=3 is observed, which is explained by the
recurrence properties of random walks in two dimensional lattices, which is
beyond the mean-field approaches. At high temperatures, a crossover to a fully
reversible regime is observed, characterized by a large density of small
islands, a small density of very large islands, and total island and monomer
densities increasing with temperature, in contrast to IA models. CZDs and ISDs
with Gaussian right tails appear in all regimes for R ~ 10^7 or larger,
including the fully reversible regime, where the CZDs are bimodal. This shows
that the Pimpinelli-Einstein (PE) approach for IA explains the main mechanisms
for the large islands to compete for free adatom aggregation in the reversible
model, and may be the reason for its successful application to a variety of
materials and growth conditions.

the growth exponents converge to \beta_{KPZ} = 1/3 and the HDs converge to the

the last ones. While the EW-KPZ crossover appears in the roughness scaling in a
broad range of probabilities p around p_c, a Gaussian-GOE crossover is not
observed in the HDs into the same interval, possibly being restricted to values
of p very close to p_c. These results improve recent ones reported by de Assis

suppressed by the CRT, but the QD shows quite different behaviors, if initiated

not influenced by the CRT and generally finite in the long time evolution at

galaxies (N_gal) that occupy a halo, given the halo's properties. These types
of mappings are crucial for constructing the mock galaxy catalogs necessary for
analyses of large-scale structure. The ML techniques proposed here distinguish
themselves from traditional halo occupation distribution (HOD) modeling as they
do not assume a prescribed relationship between halo properties and N_gal. In
addition, our ML approaches are only dependent on parent halo properties (like
HOD methods), which are advantageous over subhalo-based approaches as
identifying subhalos correctly is difficult. We test 2 algorithms: support
vector machines (SVM) and k-nearest-neighbour (kNN) regression. We take
galaxies and halos from the Millennium simulation and predict N_gal by training
our algorithms on the following 6 halo properties: number of particles, M_200,
\sigma_v, v_max, half-mass radius and spin. For Millennium, our predicted N_gal
values have a mean-squared-error (MSE) of ~0.16 for both SVM and kNN. Our
predictions match the overall distribution of halos reasonably well and the
galaxy correlation function at large scales to ~5-10%. In addition, we
demonstrate a feature selection algorithm to isolate the halo parameters that
are most predictive, a useful technique for understanding the mapping between
halo properties and N_gal. Lastly, we investigate these ML-based approaches in
making mock catalogs for different galaxy subpopulations (e.g. blue, red, high
M_star, low M_star). Given its non-parametric nature as well as its powerful
predictive and feature selection capabilities, machine learning offers an
interesting alternative for creating mock catalogs.

transition to non-equilibrium clustering found in many experiments and
simulation studies with self-propelled particles (SPPs) with alignment can be
obtained from a simple kinetic model. The key elements of this approach are the
scaling of the cluster cross-section with the cluster mass -- characterized by
an exponent $\alpha$ -- and the scaling of the cluster perimeter with the
cluster mass -- described by an exponent $\beta$. The analysis of the kinetic
approach reveals that the SPPs exhibit two phases: i) an individual phase,
where the cluster size distribution (CSD) is dominated by an exponential tail
that defines a characteristic cluster size, and ii) a collective phase
characterized by the presence of non-monotonic CSD with a local maximum at
large cluster sizes. At the transition between these two phases the CSD is well
described by a power-law with a critical exponent $\gamma$, which is a function
of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ only. The critical exponent is found to be in the range
$0.8 < \gamma < 1.5$ in line with observations in experiments and simulations.

the PR measurements, confirm that E$_g$ is equal to $\bigtriangleup_{SO}$ for
$\textit{x} \approx$ 9$%$. We then theoretically probe the inhomogeneous
broadening of the interband transition energies as a function of the alloy

conventional alloy effects, while the behaviour of the heavy-hole transitions
can be well described using a valence band-anticrossing model. We show that for
the samples containing 8.5% and 10.4% Bi the difficulty in identifying a clear
light-hole-related transition energy from the measured PR data is due to the
significant broadening of the host matrix light-hole states as a result of the
presence of a large number of Bi resonant states in the same energy range and
disorder in the alloy. We further provide quantitative estimates of the impact
of supercell size and the assumed random distribution of Bi atoms on the

passive galaxies with NUV - r >= 4.25 and blue, star-forming galaxies with NUV

located in poor groups, while the red ones are in rich groups. The number of
close neighbours per red galaxy increases with N, with n_red being proportional
to 0.11N, while that of blue galaxies does not depend on N and is roughly
constant. In addition, these trends are found to be independent of redshift,
and only the average n_blue evolves, decreasing with cosmic time. Our results
support the following assembly history of L_B >= L*_B galaxies in the group
environment: red, massive galaxies were formed in or accreted by the dark
matter halo of the group at early times (z >= 1), therefore their number of
neighbours provides a fossil record of the stellar mass assembly of groups,
traced by their richness N. On the other hand, blue, less massive galaxies have
recently been accreted by the group potential and are still in their parent
dark matter halo, having the same number of neighbours irrespective of N. As
time goes by, these blue galaxies settle in the group potential and turn red
and/or fainter, thus becoming satellite galaxies in the group. With a toy
quenching model, we estimate an infall rate of field galaxies into the group

may include collisional modification of the accelerated electron spectrum
inside the acceleration region. The models are characterized by two parameters:
the plasma density $n$ in, and the longitudinal extent $L_0$ of, the
acceleration region. Determination of the best-fit values of these parameters
permits inference of the volume that encompasses the acceleration region and of
the total number of particles within it. It is then straightforward to compute
values for the emission filling factor and for the {\it specific acceleration
rate} (electrons s$^{-1}$ per ambient electron above a chosen reference
energy). For the 24 events studied, the range of inferred filling factors is
consistent with a value of unity. The inferred mean value of the specific
acceleration rate above $E_0=20$ keV is $\sim10^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, with a
1$\sigma$ spread of about a half-order-of-magnitude above and below this value.
We compare these values with the predictions of several models, including
acceleration by large-scale, weak (sub-Dreicer) fields, by strong
(super-Dreicer) electric fields in a reconnecting current sheet, and by
stochastic acceleration processes.

at the peak hour. To that end, a Stackelberg game is proposed to capture the
interactions between the grid and consumers, and it is shown analytically that
optimal energy trading parameters that maximize customers utilities are
obtained at the solution of the game. A novel distributed algorithm is proposed
to reach the optimal solution of the game, and numerical examples are used to
assess the properties and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

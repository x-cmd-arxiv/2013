evolution of the luminosity function (LF) of galaxies and active galactic
nuclei (AGN) in the infrared (IR). Based on the observed dichotomy in the ages
of stellar populations of early-type galaxies on one side and late-type
galaxies on the other, the model interprets the epoch-dependent LFs at z \geq
1.5 using a physical model for the evolution of proto-spheroidal galaxies and
of the associated AGNs, while IR galaxies at z<1.5 are interpreted as being
mostly late-type 'cold' (normal) and 'warm' (starburst) galaxies. As for
proto-spheroids, in addition to the epoch-dependent LFs of stellar and AGN
components separately, we have worked out the evolving LFs of these objects as
a whole (stellar plus AGN component). The model provides a physical explanation
for the observed positive evolution of both galaxies and AGNs up to z \simeq
2.5 and for the negative evolution at higher redshifts, for the sharp
transition from Euclidean to extremely steep counts at (sub-)mm wavelengths, as
well as the (sub-)mm counts of strongly lensed galaxies, that are hard to
account for by alternative, physical or phenomenological, approaches. The
evolution of late-type galaxies and of z<1.5 AGNs is described using a
parametric phenomenological approach. The modeled AGN contributions to the
counts and to the cosmic infrared background (CIB) are always subdominant with
maximal at mid-IR wavelengths. The model provides a good fit to the
multi-wavelength (from the mid-IR to millimeter waves) data on LFs at different
redshifts and on number counts (both global and per redshift slices). A
prediction of the present model is a systematic variation with wavelength of
the populations dominating the counts and the contributions to the CIB
intensity. The implied specific trend for cross-wavelength CIB power spectra is
found to be in good agreement with the data.

of multiplying by a suppression factor those highly-accurate total zero-density

calculations and which have been benchmarked by experiment. The suppression
factor is based-upon earlier detailed collision-radiative calculations which
were made for a wide range of ions at various densities and temperatures, but
used a simplified treatment of DR. A general suppression formula is then
developed as a function of isoelectronic sequence, charge, density, and
temperature. These density-dependent effective DR rate coefficients are then
used in the plasma simulation code Cloudy to compute ionization balance curves
for both collisionally ionized and photoionized plasmas at very low (ne = 1
cm^-3) and finite (ne=10^10 cm^-3) densities. We find that the denser case is
significantly more ionized due to suppression of DR, warranting further studies
of density effects on DR by detailed collisional-radiative calculations which
utilize state-of-the-art partial DR rate coefficients. This is expected to
impact the predictions of the ionization balance in denser cosmic gases such as
those found in nova and supernova shells, accretion disks, and the broad
emission line regions in active galactic nuclei.

grid based simulations cover a radial range from 0.1 to 200 pc. Here, as in
previous studies by our group, we include gas radiative cooling as well as
heating by a sub-Eddington X-ray source near the central supermassive black
hole of 10^8 M_{\odot}. Our theoretical estimates and simulations show that for
the X-ray luminosity L_X \sim 0.008 L_{Edd}, the gas is thermally and
convectivelly unstable within the computational domain. In the simulations, we
observe that very tiny fluctuations in an initially smooth, spherically
symmetric, accretion flow, grow first linearly and then non-linearly.
Consequently, an initially one-phase flow relatively quickly transitions into a
two-phase/cold-hot accretion flow. For L_X = 0.015 L_{Edd} or higher, the cold
clouds continue to accrete but in some regions of the hot phase, the gas starts
to move outward. For L_X < 0.015 L_{Edd}, the cold phase contribution to the
total mass accretion rate only moderately dominates over the hot phase
contribution. This result might have some consequences for cosmological
simulations of the so-called AGN feedback problem. Our simulations confirm the
previous results of Barai et al. (2012) who used smoothed particle hydrodynamic
simulations to tackle the same problem. However here, because we use a grid
based code to solve equations in 1-D and 2-D, we are able to follow the gas
dynamics at much higher spacial resolution and for longer time in comparison to
the 3-D SPH simulations. One of new features revealed by our simulations is
that the cold condensations in the accretion flow initially form long
filaments, but at the later times, those filaments may break into smaller
clouds advected outwards within the hot outflow. These simulations may serve as
an attractive model for the so-called Narrow Line Region in AGN.

dramatically when loops are allowed to cross. We study models with crossings
both analytically and with extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Our main focus
(the 'completely packed loop model with crossings') is a simple generalisation
of well-known models which shows an interesting phase diagram with continuous
phase transitions of a new kind. These separate the unusual 'Goldstone' phase
observed previously from phases with short loops. Using mappings to Z_2 lattice
gauge theory, we show that the continuum description of the model is a replica
limit of the sigma model on real projective space (RP^{n-1}). This field theory
sustains Z_2 point defects which proliferate at the transition. In addition to
studying the new critical points, we characterise the universal properties of
the Goldstone phase in detail, comparing renormalisation group (RG)
calculations with numerical data on systems of linear size up to L=10^6 at loop
fugacity n=1. (Very large sizes are necessary because of the logarithmic form
of correlation functions and other observables.) The model is relevant to
polymers on the verge of collapse, and a particular point in parameter space
maps to self-avoiding trails at their \Theta-point; we use the RG treatment of
a perturbed sigma model to resolve some perplexing features in the previous
literature on trails. Finally, one of the phase transitions considered here is
a close analogue of those in disordered electronic systems --- specifically,
Anderson metal-insulator transitions --- and provides a simpler context in
which to study the properties of these poorly-understood (central-charge-zero)
critical points.

sequence of galaxies of progressively earlier type, lower gas-content exists in
the neighborhood of the Coma cluster, with specific star formation activity
decreasing with increasing local galaxy density and velocity dispersion. In the
dwarf regime (8.5<\log(M*)< 9.5) we identify a 4-step sequence of galaxies with
progressively redder colors, i.e. of decreasing specific star formation, from
(1) HI-rich Late-Type Galaxies belonging to the blue-cloud exhibiting extended
plus nuclear star formation, (2) HI-poor LTGs with nuclear star formation only,
(3) HI-poor galaxies with no star formation either extended or nuclear, but
with nuclear Post-Star-Burst signature,(4) Early-type Galaxies in the
red-sequence, with no gas or star formation on all scales. Along this sequence
the quenching of the star formation proceeds radially outside-in. The
progression toward redder colors found along this ""morphological"" (gas content)
sequence is comparable to the one obtained increasing the local galaxy density,
from the cosmic filaments (1,2), to the rich clusters (2,3,4). In the dwarf
regime we find evidence for evolution of HI-rich LTGs into ETGs, passing
through HI-poor and PSB galaxies, driven by the environment. We identify
ram-pressure as the mechanism most likely responsible for this transformation.

evaluate the lower bounds on the expected utility by Monte Carlo simulation

bounds and upper bounds indicate that the available policy is near optimal as

about how fast these stars rotate and also about the mechanisms involved in the
angular-momentum and mass input in the disk. We study the properties of stars
that rotate near their critical-rotation rate and investigate the properties of
the disks formed by equatorial mass ejections. We used the most recent Geneva
stellar evolutionary tracks for rapidly rotating stars that reach the critical
limit and used a simple model for the disk structure. We obtain that for a 9
Msun star at solar metallicity, the minimum average velocity during the Main
Sequence phase to reach the critical velocity is around 330 km/s, whereas it
would be 390 km/s at the metallicity of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Red
giants or supergiants originating from very rapid rotators rotate six times
faster and show N/C ratios three times higher than those originating from
slowly rotating stars. This difference becomes stronger at lower metallicity.
It might therefore be very interesting to study the red giants in clusters that
show a large number of Be stars on the MS band. On the basis of our single-star
models, we show that the observed Be-star fraction with cluster age is
compatible with the existence of a temperature-dependent lower limit in the
velocity rate required for a star to become a Be star. The mass, extension, and
diffusion time of the disks produced when the star is losing mass at the
critical velocity, obtained from simple parametrized expressions, are not too
far from those estimated for disks around Be-type stars. At a given
metallicity, the mass and the extension of the disk increase with the initial
mass and with age on the MS phase. Denser disks are expected in low-metallicity
regions.

low-mass binary XTE J1817-330. The 11-25 A broadband is described with a simple
absorption model that takes into account the pileup effect and results in an
estimate of the hydrogen column density. The oxygen K-edge region (21-25 A) is
fitted with the physical warmabs model, which is based on a photoionization
model grid generated with the xstar code with the most up-to-date atomic
database. This approach allows a benchmark of the atomic data which involves
wavelength shifts of both the K lines and photoionization cross sections in
order to fit the observed spectra accurately. As a result we obtain: a column
density of N(H)=1.38+/-0.01\times 10^21 cm^-2; ionization parameter of
log(xi)=-2.70+/-0.023; oxygen abundance of A(O)= 0.689^{+0.015}_{-0.010}; and
ionization fractions of OI/O = 0.911, OII/O = 0.077, and OIII/O = 0.012 that
are in good agreement with previous studies. Since the oxygen abundance in
warmabs is given relative to the solar standard of Grevesse et al. (1998), a
rescaling with the revision by Asplund et al. (2009) yields
A(O)=0.952^{+0.020}_{-0.013}, a value close to solar that reinforces the new
standard. We identify several atomic absorption lines Kalpha, Kbeta, and Kgamma

velocity centroids (VCs) and velocity ranges of emission (VRs) suffixed as
above (10 and 21) for the two transitions - VC10, VC21, VR10, and VR21. The VCs
of the two transitions are, on average, within 0.13 km s-1 of each other but
are sometimes separated by a few km s-1. The VC10s are, on average, slightly
more positive than the VC21s. The values of the VCs in the two transitions have
been compared to justify using both of these transitions to extract binary star
orbital parameters. The arithmetic mean VR10 derived from 635 observations of
47 sources is 6.4 km s-1 with a standard deviation of 3.4 km s-1 while the mean
VR21 derived from 485 observations of 41 sources is 4.2 km s-1 with a standard
deviation of 2.8 km s-1. The number of occurrences of VR10 and VR21versus
velocity range have different distributions. The differences in the VRs
indicate that the J21 and J10 emissions arise from dynamically different
regions of the circumstellar environment.

lengths of wild type (WT) accessions Col-0, Ler-0 and Ws-4 are shown to differ,
with Col-0 having the shortest and Ws-4 the longest length. Plants defective in
sugar signalling [gin1-1, gin2-1, gin6 (abi4)] and floral repressor mutants
[hst1, tfl1, tfl2 (lhp1)] showed shortened juvenile phase lengths, compared to
their respective WTs. Mutants defective in starch anabolism (adg1-1, pgm1) and
catabolism (sex1, sex4, bam3) showed prolonged juvenile phase lengths compared
to Col-0. Examination of diurnal metabolite changes in adg1-1 and sex1 mutants
indicates that their altered juvenile phase length may be due to lack of starch
turnover, which influences carbohydrate availability. In this article we
propose a model in which a variety of signals including floral activators and
repressors modulate the juvenile-to-adult phase transition. The role of
carbohydrates may be in their capacity as nutrients, osmotic regulators,
signalling molecules and/ or through their interaction with phytohormonal

genomics tool to study non- model organisms. However, when the reference
transcriptome used to calculate differential expression is incomplete,
significant error in the inferred expression levels can result. In this study,
we use simulated reads generated from real transcriptomes to determine the
accuracy of read mapping, and measure the error resulting from using an
incomplete transcriptome. We show that the two primary sources of count- ing
error are 1) alternative splice variants that share reads and 2) missing
transcripts from the reference. Alternative splice variants increase the false
positive rate of mapping while incomplete reference tran- scriptomes decrease
the true positive rate, leading to inaccurate transcript expression levels.
Grouping transcripts by gene or read sharing (similar to mapping to a reference
genome) significantly decreases false positives, but only by improving the
reference transcriptome itself can the missing transcript problem be addressed.
We also demonstrate that employing different mapping software does not yield
substantial increases in accuracy on simulated data. Finally, we show that read
lengths or insert sizes must increase past 1kb to resolve mapping ambiguity.

random vector consisting of the two estimates). We then derive the conditional
distribution of the off-diagonal blocks, which is the cross-correlation of our
interest. We show that when there are two nodes, the conditional distribution
happens to be the inverted matrix variate $t$-distribution, from which we can
readily sample. For more than two nodes, the conditional distribution is no
longer the inverted matrix variate $t$-distribution. But we show that we can
decompose it into several sampling problems, each of which is the inverted

those in other known water fountains. However, the coverage is still larger
than that of the 1612MHz OH maser. It implies that there is an outflow with a
higher velocity than the envelope expansion velocity (typically <25 km/s),

criteria to select a clean galaxy catalog and detail specific tests that we

Galactic extinction, and the overall survey uniformity. Notably, we find that
optimally we can use observed regions with seeing $< 1\farcs5$, and $r$-band
extinction < 0.13 magnitudes, smaller than previously published results.
Furthermore, we confirm that the uniformity of the SDSS photometry is minimally
affected by the stripe geometry. We find that, overall, the two-point angular
correlation function can be described by a power law, $\omega(\theta) =
A_\omega \theta^{(1-\gamma)}$ with $\gamma \simeq 1.72$, over the range
$0\fdg005$--$10\degr$. We also find similar relationships for the four
magnitude subsamples, but the amplitude within the same angular interval for
the four subsamples is found to decrease with fainter magnitudes, in agreement
with previous results. We find that the systematic signals are well below the
galaxy angular correlation function for angles less than approximately
$5\degr$, which limits the modeling of galaxy angular correlations on larger
scales. Finally, we present our custom, highly parallelized two-point

a robust predictor is constructed using a series of signal space projections.
Compared to some of the existing phase-correction methods that require
acquisition of a pre-determined set of fractional kspace lines, the proposed
predictor is found to be more efficient, due to its capability of exhibiting an
equivalent degree of performance using only half the number of fractional
lines. Robust filtering of noisy data is achieved using a second signal space
model in the frequency-encode direction, bypassing the requirement of a prior
highpass filtering operation. The signal space is constructed from Fourier
Transformed samples of each row in the low-resolution image. A set of FIR
filters are estimated by fitting a least squares model to this signal space.
Partial kspace extrapolation using the FIR filters is shown to result in
artifact-free reconstruction, particularly in respect of Gibbs ringing and

  Nuclear Physics A 889, 1-7 (2012)",,,,"nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a study of $\tau^+ \tau^-$ lepton pair production in Pb + Pb
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.5 TeV. The larger mass of tau lepton compared
to electron and muon leads to considerably small hadronic contribution to the
$\tau^+ \tau^-$ pair invariant mass (M) distribution relative to the production
from thermal partonic sources. The quark-antiquark annihilation processes via
intermediary virtual photon, Z and Higgs bosons have been considered for the
tau lepton production. The contribution from Drell-Yan process is found to
dominate over thermal yield for $\tau^+ \tau^-$ pair mass from 4 to 20 GeV at
the LHC energy. We also present the ratio of $\tau$ lepton pair yields for
nucleus-nucleus collisions relative to yields from p + p collisions scaled by
number of binary collisions at LHC energies as a function $\tau$ lepton pair
inavariant mass. The ratio is found to be significantly above unity for the
mass range 4 to 6 GeV. This indicates the possibility of detecting $\tau^+
\tau^-$ pair from quark gluon plasma (QGP) in the mass window 4 to 6 GeV.

Due to the electron-electron magnetic interaction, the differential

neutron star to become metastable or unstable. The Fermi liquid of nucleons
under the crust can be in a metastable state, while the crust is unstable to
the formation of layers of alternating magnetization. The change of the
magnetic stress acting on adjacent domains can result in a series of shifts or
fractures in the crust. The releasing of magnetic free energy and elastic

a series of shifts or fractures in the deep crust which is closed to the Fermi
liquid of nucleons can trigger the phase transition of the Fermi liquid of
nucleons from a metastable state to a stable state. The released magnetic free
energy in the Fermi liquid of nucleons corresponds to the giant flares observed

efficient manner. We developed a tool called CASSARA to evaluate the proposed

put constraints on possible ejection mechanisms. Historically, these quantities
have been derived from CO using ground-based observations. It is thus important
to investigate whether parameters such as momentum rate (thrust) and mechanical
luminosity (power) are the same when different molecular tracers are used.
Aims. We aim at determining the outflow momentum, dynamical time-scale, thrust,
energy and power using CO and H2O as tracers of outflow activity. Methods.
Within the framework of the WISH key program, three molecular outflows from
Class 0 sources have been mapped using the HIFI instrument aboard Herschel. We
use these observations together with previously published H2 data to infer the
physical properties of the outflows. We compare the physical properties derived
here with previous estimates based on CO observations. Results. Inspection of
the spatial distribution of H2O and H2 confirms that these molecules are
co-spatial. The most prominent emission peaks in H2 coincide with strong H2O
emission peaks and the estimated widths of the flows when using the two tracers
are comparable. Conclusions. For the momentum rate and the mechanical
luminosity, inferred values are independent of which tracer that is used, i.e.,
the values agree to within a factor of 4 and 3 respectively.

unavailable in many practical circumstances and needs to be estimated from

background estimation in such conditions, with low computational and memory
requirements. Image sequences are analysed on a block-by-block basis. For each
block location a representative set is maintained which contains distinct
blocks obtained along its temporal line. The background estimation is carried
out in a Markov Random Field framework, where the optimal labelling solution is
computed using iterated conditional modes. The clique potentials are computed
based on the combined frequency response of the candidate block and its
neighbourhood. It is assumed that the most appropriate block results in the
smoothest response, indirectly enforcing the spatial continuity of structures
within a scene. Experiments on real-life surveillance videos demonstrate that
the proposed method obtains considerably better background estimates (both
qualitatively and quantitatively) than median filtering and the recently
proposed ""intervals of stable intensity"" method. Further experiments on the
Wallflower dataset suggest that the combination of the proposed method with a
foreground segmentation algorithm results in improved foreground segmentation.

to solve numerically the coupled Navier-Stokes equations of fluid dynamics and

Associated to the moment propagation scheme, it became possible to extract the
effective diffusion and dispersion coefficients of tracers, or solutes, of any
charge, e.g. in porous media. Nevertheless, the dynamical properties of tracers
depend on the tracer-surface affinity, which is not purely electrostatic, but
also includes a species-specific contribution. In order to capture this
important feature, we introduce specific adsorption and desorption processes in
a Lattice-Boltzmann scheme through a modified moment propagation algorithm, in
which tracers may adsorb and desorb from surfaces through kinetic reaction
rates. The method is validated on exact results for pure diffusion and
diffusion-advection in Poiseuille flows in a simple geometry. We finally
illustrate the importance of taking such processes into account on the
time-dependent diffusion coefficient in a more complex porous medium.

solution expanded from the one-dimensional global solution of hot accretion
flows, injected gas with various angular momentum distributions, and the gas
from a large-scale numerical simulation. Special attention is paid to the
radial profiles of the mass accretion rate and density. Both can be described
by a power-law function, $\dot{M}\propto r^s$ and $\rho\propto r^{-p}$. We find
that if the angular momentum is not very low, the value of $s$ is not sensitive
to the initial condition and lies within a narrow range, $0.47\la s \la 0.55$.
However, the value of $p$ is more sensitive to the initial condition and lies
in the range $0.48\la p \la 0.8$. The diversity of the density profile is
because different initial conditions give different radial profiles of radial
velocity due to the different angular momentum of the initial conditions. When
the angular momentum of the accretion flow is very low, the inflow rate is
constant with radius. Taking the torus model as an example, we have also
investigated the effects of inner and outer boundary conditions by considering
the widely adopted ""outflow"" boundary condition and the ""mass flux
conservation"" condition. We find that the results are not sensitive to these
two boundary conditions.

needed to cover all edges. When those vertices are further required to induce a
connected subgraph, the corresponding number is called the connected vertex
cover number, and is always greater or equal to the vertex cover number.
  Connected vertex covers are found in many applications, and the relationship
between those two graph invariants is therefore a natural question to
investigate. For that purpose, we introduce the {\em Price of Connectivity},
defined as the ratio between the two vertex cover numbers. We prove that the
price of connectivity is at most 2 for arbitrary graphs. We further consider
graph classes in which the price of connectivity of every induced subgraph is
bounded by some real number $t$. We obtain forbidden induced subgraph
characterizations for every real value $t \leq 3/2$.
  We also investigate critical graphs for this property, namely, graphs whose
price of connectivity is strictly greater than that of any proper induced
subgraph. Those are the only graphs that can appear in a forbidden subgraph
characterization for the hereditary property of having a price of connectivity
at most $t$. In particular, we completely characterize the critical graphs that
are also chordal.
  Finally, we also consider the question of computing the price of connectivity
of a given graph. Unsurprisingly, the decision version of this question is
NP-hard. In fact, we show that it is even complete for the class $\Theta_2^P =
P^{NP[\log]}$, the class of decision problems that can be solved in polynomial
time, provided we can make $O(\log n)$ queries to an NP-oracle. This paves the
way for a thorough investigation of the complexity of problems involving ratios

the concept of Leinster $n$-algebra in $Alg(k)$. The difference between the
Leinster original definition and our relaxed one is apparent when $n>1$, for

  We believe that there exists a functor from weak Leinster $(n,1)$-algebras
over $k$ to $C(E_{n+1},k)$-algebras, well-defined when $k=\mathbb{Q}$, and
preserving weak equivalences. For the case $n=1$ such a functor is constructed
in [Sh4] by elementary simplicial methods, providing (together with this paper)
a complete solution for 1-monoidal abelian categories.

completed in the present paper, provides a construction of a weak Leinster

category (provided the compatibility and non-degeneracy condition are
fulfilled). The second part (still open for $n>1$) is a passage from weak
Leinster $(n,1)$-algebras to $C(E_{n+1},k)$-algebras.
  As an application, we prove that the Gerstenhaber-Schack complex of a Hopf
algebra over a field $k$ of characteristic 0 admits a structure of a weak
Leinster (2,1)-algebra over $k$ extending the Yoneda structure. It relies on
our earlier construction [Sh1] of a 2-fold monoidal structure on the abelian

Despite its relevance, no general theory that captures all features of
hierarchy and its origins has been proposed yet. Here we present a formal
approach resulting from the convergence of theoretical morphology and network
theory that allows constructing a 3D morphospace of hierarchies and hence
comparing the hierarchical organization of ecological, cellular, technological
and social networks. Embedded within large voids in the morphospace of all
possible hierarchies, four major groups are identified. Two of them match the
expected from random networks with similar connectivity, thus suggesting that
non-adaptive factors are at work. Ecological and gene networks define the other
two, indicating that their topological order is the result of functional
constraints. These results are consistent with an exploration of the
morphospace using in silico evolved networks.

stochastic differential equation (SDE). The spatial structure is included by
introducing linear operators, which affect both the oscillations and damping,
and by choosing the appropriate spatial covariance structure of the driving
time-white noise process. With the choice of the linear operators as partial
differential operators, the resonator model becomes a stochastic partial
differential equation (SPDE), which is compatible with infinite-dimensional
Kalman filtering. The resulting infinite-dimensional Kalman filtering problem
allows for a computationally efficient solution as the computational cost
scales linearly with measurements in the temporal dimension. This framework is
applied to weather prediction and to physiological noise elimination in fMRI

Our aim is also to correlate the AMR with the spatial distribution of the
clusters. In the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the majority of the selected
clusters are young (up to 1 Gyr) and our aim is to search for an AMR at this
epoch which has not been much studied. Methods: We report on results for 15 LMC
and 8 Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) clusters, scattered all over the area of
these galaxies, to cover a wide spatial distribution and metallicity range. The
selected LMC clusters were observed with the 1.54m Danish Telescope in Chile,
using the Danish Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (DFOSC) with a single
2kx2k CCD, whereas the SMC clusters were observed with the ESO 3.6m Telescope

obtained frames were analysed with the conventional DAOPHOT and IRAF software.
We used Str\""{o}mgren filters in order to achieve reliable metallicities from
photometry. Isochrone fitting was used in order to determine the ages and
metallicities. Results: The AMR for the LMC displays a metallicity gradient,
with higher metallicities for the younger ages. The AMR for LMC-SMC star
clusters shows a possible jump in metallicity and a considerable increase at
about 6x10^8 yr. It is possible that this is connected to the latest LMC-SMC
interaction. The AMR for the LMC also displays a metallicity gradient with
distance from the centre. The metallicities in SMC are lower, as expected for a
metal poor host galaxy.

half on immersion in a dodecane environment. More significantly, its spatial
resolution, surprisingly, would remain practically unaffected, and the thermal

improved. Our experimental trials of such immersion SThM, or iSThM, were fully

of dispersion (convex or concave) and a general pressure law. Two mechanisms
leading to the breakdown of this simple wave DSW theory for sufficiently large

  Variables","19 pages, 1 figure",,"10.1007/s10714-017-2251-6",,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Ashtekar and Ashtekar-Barbero connection variable formulations of Kerr
isolated horizons are derived. Using a regular Kinnersley tetrad in
horizon-penetrating Kruskal-Szekeres-like coordinates, the spin coefficients of
Kerr geometry are determined by solving the first Maurer-Cartan equation of
structure. Isolated horizon conditions are imposed on the tetrad and the spin
coefficients. A transformation into an orthonormal tetrad frame that is fixed
in the time gauge is applied and explicit calculations of the spin connection,
the Ashtekar and Ashtekar-Barbero connections, and the corresponding curvatures
on the horizon 2-spheres are performed. Since the resulting Ashtekar-Barbero
curvature does not comply with the simple form of the horizon boundary
condition of Schwarzschild isolated horizons, i.e., on the horizon 2-spheres,
the Ashtekar-Barbero curvature is not proportional to the Plebanski 2-form,
which is required for an SU(2) Chern-Simons treatment of the gauge degrees of
freedom in the horizon boundary in the context of loop quantum gravity, a
general method to construct a new connection whose curvature satisfies such a
relation for Kerr isolated horizons is introduced. For the purpose of
illustration, this method is employed in the framework of slowly rotating Kerr
isolated horizons.

the Herschel observatory of a variable far-infrared source associated with the
compact jets of the black hole transient GX 339-4 during the decay of its
recent 2010-2011 outburst, after the transition to the hard state. We also
outline the results of very sensitive radio observations conducted with the
Australia Telescope Compact Array, along with a series of near-infrared,
optical (OIR) and X-ray observations, allowing for the first time the
re-ignition of the compact jets to be observed over a wide range of
wavelengths. The compact jets first turn on at radio frequencies with an
optically thin spectrum that later evolves to optically thick synchrotron
emission. An OIR reflare is observed about ten days after the onset of radio
and hard X-ray emission, likely reflecting the necessary time to build up
enough density, as well as to have acceleration (e.g. through shocks) along an
extended region in the jets. The Herschel measurements are consistent with an
extrapolation of the radio inverted power-law spectrum, but they highlight a
more complex radio to OIR spectral energy distribution for the jets.

  (2012), Article ID 758340, 10 pages",,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Network coding is an elegant technique where, instead of simply relaying the
packets of information they receive, the nodes of a network are allowed to
combine \emph{several} packets together for transmission and this technique can
be used to achieve the maximum possible information flow in a network and save
the needed number of packet transmissions. Moreover, in an energy-constraint
wireless network such as Wireless Sensor Network (a typical type of wireless ad
hoc network), applying network coding to reduce the number of wireless
transmissions can also prolong the life time of sensor nodes. Although applying
network coding in a wireless sensor network is obviously beneficial, due to the
operation that one transmitting information is actually combination of multiple
other information, it is possible that an error propagation may occur in the
network. This special characteristic also exposes network coding system to a
wide range of error attacks, especially Byzantine attacks. When some adversary
nodes generate error data in the network with network coding, those erroneous
information will be mixed at intermeidate nodes and thus corrupt all the
information reaching a destination. Recent research efforts have shown that
network coding can be combined with classical error control codes and
cryptography for secure communication or misbehavior detection. Nevertheless,
when it comes to Byzantine attacks, these results have limited effect. In fact,
unless we find out those adversary nodes and isolate them, network coding may
perform much worse than pure routing in the presence of malicious nodes. In
this paper, a distributed hierarchical algorithm based on random linear network
coding is developed to detect, locate and isolate malicious nodes.

While artifact-centric modeling shows significant advantages, the overwhelming
majority of existing process mining methods cannot be applied (directly) as
they are tailored to discover monolithic process models. This paper addresses
the problem by proposing a chain of methods that can be applied to discover
artifact lifecycle models in Guard-Stage-Milestone notation. We decompose the
problem in such a way that a wide range of existing (non-artifact-centric)
process discovery and analysis methods can be reused in a flexible manner. The

upflows on granular cells in data from the {\sc Sunrise}/IMaX instrument. In
the present work we investigate the physical origin of these events employing
data of the same instrument but with higher spectral sampling. By means of the
inversion of Stokes profiles we are able to recover the physical parameters
(temperature, magnetic field, line-of-sight velocity, etc) present in the solar
photosphere at the time of these events. The inversion is performed in a
Monte-Carlo-like fashion, that is, repeating it many times with different
initializations and retaining only the best result. We find that many of the
events are characterized by a reversal in the polarity of the magnetic field
along the vertical direction in the photosphere, accompanied by an enhancement
in the temperature and by supersonic line-of-sight velocities. In about half of
the studied events, large blue-shifted and red-shifted line-of-sight velocities
coexist above/below each other. These features can be explained in terms of
magnetic reconnection, where the energy stored in the magnetic field is
released in the form of kinetic and thermal energy when magnetic field lines of
opposite polarities coalesce. However, the agreement with magnetic reconnection
is not perfect and therefore, other possible physical mechanisms might also
play a role.

strategyproofness) and efficiency (in terms of dominance). This set of
conditions is tight in the sense that trade-offs may become degenerate if any
of the conditions are dropped. Moreover, we give an algorithm for the mechanism

Probabilistic Serial, as well as with the adaptive Boston mechanism, and we

much researched continuous spin representations of the Poincar\'e group. The
Wigner equations, treated as first class constraints, yields to a
four-constraint BRST formulation. The resulting field theory, generalizing free
higher spin field theory, is one among a set of higher spin theories that can
be related to previous work on unconstrained formulations. In particular, it is
conjectured that the unconstrained higher spin theory of Francia and Sagnotti
is a limit of a continuous spin theory. Furthermore, a simple analysis of the
constraint structure reveals a hint of a physical rationale behind the trace
constraints.

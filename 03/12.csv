assessed in this paper. Its input consists of segments, and each one is
assigned the class which minimizes a stochastic distance. Assuming the complex
Wishart model, several stochastic distances are obtained from the h-phi family
of divergences, and they are employed to derive hypothesis test statistics that
are also used in the classification process. This article also presents, as a
novelty, analytic expressions for the test statistics based on the following
stochastic distances between complex Wishart models: Kullback-Leibler,
Bhattacharyya, Hellinger, R\'enyi, and Chi-Square; also, the test statistic
based on the Bhattacharyya distance between multivariate Gaussian distributions
is presented. The classifier performance is evaluated using simulated and real
PolSAR data. The simulated data are based on the complex Wishart model, aiming
at the analysis of the proposal well controlled data. The real data refer to
the complex L-band image, acquired during the 1994 SIR-C mission. The results
of the proposed classifier are compared with those obtained by a Wishart
per-pixel/contextual classifier, and we show the better performance of the
region-based classification. The influence of the statistical modeling is
assessed by comparing the results using the Bhattacharyya distance between
multivariate Gaussian distributions for amplitude data. The results with
simulated data indicate that the proposed classification method has a very good
performance when the data follow the Wishart model. The proposed classifier
also performs better than the per-pixel/contextual classifier and the
Bhattacharyya Gaussian distance using SIR-C PolSAR data.

loss due to stellar evolution. After determining that the differences between
AMUSE results and prior publications are understood, we explored the variation

30%. Two modes of star cluster dissolution were identified: a mass evolution
curve that contains a run-away cluster dissolution with a sudden loss of mass,
and a dissolution mode that does not contain this feature. We refer to these
dissolution modes as ""dynamical"" and ""relaxation"" dominated respectively. For
Salpeter-like initial mass functions, we determined the boundary between these

Instead
of extending the canonical Solid-Face-Edge-Vertex schema by, say, ""hypersolids""
these classes are generalised to a common type SpatialEntity, and the
individual BoundedBy relations between two consecutive classes are generalised
to one BoundedBy relation on SpatialEntity instances. Then the pair
(SpatialEntity, BoundedBy) is a so-called incidence graph.
  The novelty about this approach uses the observation that an incidence graph
represents a topological space of SpatialEntity instances because the
BoundedBy-relation defines a so-called Alexandrov topology for them turning
them into a topological space. So spatial data becomes part of mathematical
topology and topology can be immediately applied to spatial data. For example,
continuous functions between two instances of spatial data allow the consistent
modelling of generalisation. Further, it is also possible to establish a formal
topological definition of spatial data dimension, and every topological data
model of arbitrary dimension gets a simple uniform data model. This model
covers space-time, and the version history of a spatial model can be
represented by an Alexandrov topology, too. By integrating space, time,
version, and scale into one single schema, topological queries across those
aspects are enabled through topological constructions. In fact, the topological
constructions cover a relationally complete query language for spaces and can
be redefined to operate accordingly on their graph representations.
  With these observations a relational database schema for a spatial data model
of dimension 6 and more is developed. The schema seamlessly integrates 4D
space-time, levels of detail and version history, and it can be easily expanded
to also contain non-spatial information or be linked to other data sources.

string or ""brane"" order parameters are natural for measurements in cold atom
systems using quantum gas microscopy. We propose them as a way to identify
symmetry-protected topological phases of Majorana fermions in cold atom
experiments via bulk rather than edge degrees of freedom. Subsequently, we
study two-dimensional (2D) topological superconductors via the quasi-1D limit
of coupling $N$ identical chains on the cylinder. We classify the symmetric,
interacting topological phases protected by the additional $\mathbb{Z}_N$
translation symmetry. The phases include quasi-1D analogs of (i) the $p+ip$
chiral topological superconductor, which can be distinguished up to the 2D
Chern number mod 2, and (ii) the 2D weak topological superconductor. We devise
general rules for constructing nonlocal order parameters which distinguish the

the symmetry properties of the terminating operators of the nonlocal string or
brane. The nonlocal order parameters for some of these phases simply involve a
product of the string order parameters for the individual chains. Finally, we
give a physical picture of one of the topological phases as a condensate of

of Hamiltonian systems in one spatial dimension. We examine how the Jordan
block structure of the associated linearized operator bifurcates for small
values of the Floquet exponent to derive a criterion governing instability to
long wavelengths perturbations in terms of the kinetic and potential energies,
the momentum, the mass of the underlying wave, and their derivatives. The
dispersion operator of the equation is allowed to be nonlocal, for which Evans
function techniques may not be applicable. We illustrate the results by
discussing analytically and numerically equations of Korteweg-de Vries type.

This paper proposes several fit-&-match energy formulations based on a
generalization of the assignment problem. We developed an efficient solver
based on min-cost-max-flow algorithm that finds near optimal solutions. Our
approach significantly increases the number of detected matches. In practice,
energy-based joint fitting & matching allows to increase the distance between

opportunity to measure the non-Gaussianity generated from nonlinear structure
formation and also probes information about galaxy formation and evolution that
is generally not available from the two-point correlation function (2PCF). We
measure the 3PCF of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR7 main sample galaxies in
both redshift and projected spaces on scales up to 40Mpc/h. We explore the
dependence of the 3PCF on galaxy stellar mass and color in order to constrain
the formation and evolution for galaxies of different properties. The study of
the dependence on these properties also helps better constrain the relation
between galaxy stellar mass and color and the properties of their hosting
dark-matter halos. We focus on the study of the reduced 3PCF, Q, defined as the
ratio between the 3PCF and the sum of the products of the 2PCFs. We find a very
weak stellar mass dependence of Q in both redshift and projected spaces. On
small scales, more massive galaxies tend to have slightly higher amplitudes of
Q. The shape dependence of Q is also weak on these small scales, regardless of
stellar mass and color. The reduced 3PCF has a strong color dependence for the
low-mass galaxies, while no significant dependence on color is found for the
high-mass galaxies. Low-mass red galaxies have higher amplitudes and stronger
shape dependence of the reduced 3PCF than the blue galaxies, implying that
these low-mass red galaxies tend to populate filamentary structures. The linear
galaxy bias model fails to interpret the color dependence of Q, emphasizing the
importance of a nonvanishing quadratic bias parameter in the correct modeling
of the galaxy color distribution.

tumor regions from MR images. Sparse coding with data-adapted dictionaries has
been successfully employed in several image recovery and vision problems. The
proposed approaches obtain sparse codes for each pixel in brain magnetic
resonance images considering their intensity values and location information.
Since it is trivial to obtain pixel-wise sparse codes, and combining multiple
features in the sparse coding setup is not straightforward, we propose to
perform sparse coding in a high-dimensional feature space where non-linear
similarities can be effectively modeled. We use the training data from
expert-segmented images to obtain kernel dictionaries with the kernel K-lines
clustering procedure. For a test image, sparse codes are computed with these
kernel dictionaries, and they are used to identify the tumor regions. This
approach is completely automated, and does not require user intervention to
initialize the tumor regions in a test image. Furthermore, a low complexity
segmentation approach based on kernel sparse codes, which allows the user to
initialize the tumor region, is also presented. Results obtained with both the
proposed approaches are validated against manual segmentation by an expert
radiologist, and the proposed methods lead to accurate tumor identification.

the neutrons become relativistic while collisionally coupled with the ions.
Here, we argue that the neutrons in the flow eventually undergo inelastic
collisions around the termination shock inside the stellar material, producing
~0.1-1 GeV neutrinos, without relying on cosmic-ray acceleration mechanisms.
Even higher-energy neutrinos may be produced via particle acceleration
mechanisms. We show that PINGU and Hyper-Kamiokande can detect such neutrinos
from nearby core-collapse supernovae, by reducing the atmospheric neutrino
background via coincident detection of MeV neutrinos or gravitational waves and
optical observations. Detection of these GeV and/or higher-energy neutrinos
would provide important clues to the physics of magnetic acceleration,
nucleosynthesis, the relation between supernovae and gamma-ray bursts, and the

sources in large sky surveys and we apply the techniques to the VIMOS Public

NIR data (z', Ks), we develop a classifier, based on broad-band photometry, for
identifying stars, AGNs and galaxies improving the purity of the VIPERS sample.
Support Vector Machine (SVM) supervised learning algorithms allow the automatic
classification of objects into two or more classes based on a multidimensional
parameter space. In this work, we tailored the SVM for classifying stars, AGNs
and galaxies, and applied this classification to the VIPERS data. We train the
SVM using spectroscopically confirmed sources from the VIPERS and VVDS surveys.
We tested two SVM classifiers and concluded that including NIR data can
significantly improve the efficiency of the classifier. The self-check of the
best optical + NIR classifier has shown a 97% accuracy in the classification of
galaxies, 97 for stars, and 95 for AGNs in the 5-dimensional colour space. In
the test on VIPERS sources with 99% redshift confidence, the classifier gives
an accuracy equal to 94% for galaxies, 93% for stars, and 82% for AGNs. The
method was applied to sources with low quality spectra to verify their
classification, and thus increasing the security of measurements for almost 4
900 objects. We conclude that the SVM algorithm trained on a carefully selected
sample of galaxies, AGNs, and stars outperforms simple colour-colour selection
methods, and can be regarded as a very efficient classification method
particularly suitable for modern large surveys.

VLT with the aim of building a spectroscopic sample of ~100,000 galaxies with
i_{AB}<22.5 and 0.5<z<1.5. The survey covers a total area of ~24 deg^2 within
the CFHTLS-Wide W1 and W4 fields. VIPERS is designed to address a broad range
of problems in large-scale structure and galaxy evolution, thanks to a unique
combination of volume (~ 5 x 10^7 h^{-3} Mpc^3) and sampling rate (~ 40%),
comparable to state-of-the-art surveys of the local Universe, together with
extensive multi-band optical and near-infrared photometry. Here we present the
survey design, the selection of the source catalogue and the development of the
spectroscopic observations. We discuss in detail the overall selection function
that results from the combination of the different constituents of the project.
This includes the masks arising from the parent photometric sample and the
spectroscopic instrumental footprint, together with the weights needed to
account for the sampling and the success rates of the observations. Using the
catalogue of 53,608 galaxy redshifts composing the forthcoming VIPERS Public
Data Release 1 (PDR-1), we provide a first assessment of the quality of the
spectroscopic data. Benefiting from the combination of size and detailed
sampling of this dataset, we conclude by presenting a map showing in
unprecedented detail the large-scale distribution of galaxies between 5 and 8
billion years ago. [abridged]

low energy effective model with only d-orbitals in an iron square bipartite

a s-wave normal pairing between two sublattices and a s-wave $\eta$-pairing

superconducting states in the past. The results demonstrate iron-based
superconductors being a new quantum state of matter and suggest that a

Data reduction employed two different methods of speckle suppression and

composite spectra and measured radial velocities with an iterative method for

filtering equation for a system that interacts with a probe, on which
measurements are performed according to the Positive Operator Valued Measures
(POVMs) framework. POVMs are the most general measurements one can make on a
quantum system and although in principle they can be reformulated as projective
measurements on larger spaces, for which filtering results exist, a direct
treatment of POVMs is more natural and can simplify the filter computations for
some applications. Hence we formalize the notion of strongly commuting (Davies)
instruments which allows one to develop joint measurement statistics for POVM
type measurements. This allows us to prove the existence of conditional POVMs,
which is essential for the development of a filtering equation. We demonstrate
that under generally satisfied assumptions, knowing the observed probe POVM
operator is sufficient to uniquely specify the quantum filtering evolution for
the system.

redshift-space two-point correlation functions (2PCF), and the projected
correlation function, in samples covering different ranges of B-band absolute
magnitudes and stellar masses. We considered both threshold and binned galaxy
samples, with median B-band absolute magnitudes -21.6<MB-5log(h)<-19.5 and
median stellar masses 9.8<log(M*[Msun/h^2])<10.7. We assessed the real-space
clustering in the data from the projected correlation function, which we model
as a power law in the range 0.2<r_p[Mpc/h]<20. Finally, we estimated the galaxy
bias as a function of luminosity, stellar mass, and redshift, assuming a flat
LCDM model to derive the dark matter 2PCF. We provide the best-fit parameters

length and the slope -- as well as the linear bias parameter, as a function of

provide the tightest constraints on the dependence of clustering on luminosity
at 0.5<z<1.1. We prove the complexity of comparing the clustering dependence on
stellar mass from samples that are originally flux-limited and discuss the
possible origin of the observed discrepancies. Overall, our measurements
provide stronger constraints on galaxy formation models, which are now required
to match, in addition to local observations, the clustering evolution measured
by VIPERS galaxies between z=0.5 and z=1.1 for a broad range of luminosities

U(N)xU(n+l) and comes equipped with discrete parameters N, l and k, a
continuous parameter b related to the ratio of the Yang-Mills coupling for the
two gauge groups, and one dimensionful parameter gYM^2 setting the overall
scale. A supersymmetric supergravity solution exists when Q=N-l(l-k)/2k-k/24 is
positive and is interpretable as a RG flow from a Yang-Mills like UV fixed
point to a superconformal IR fixed point with free energy of order Q^3/2. The
fate of the theory when Q is taken to be negative is less clear. We explore the
structure of the possible gravity solution for small negative Q by considering
the linearized gravitational back reaction from adding a small number of
anti-branes on the Q=0 background. Following the work of Bena, et.al., we find
that a sensible solution satisfying appropriate boundary conditions does not
appear to exist. This leaves the status of the RG flow for the Q<0 theories a
mystery. We offer the following speculative resolution to the puzzle: the -k/24
unit of charge induced by the curvature correction to supergravity should be
considered an allowed physical object, and one should be adding an anti brane
not to the Q=0 background but rather the Q=-k/24 background. Such a solution
has a repulson singularity, and gives rise to a picture of the vacuum
configuration where a cluster of anti-branes are floating around the repulson
singularity, but are stabilized from being pushed off to infinity by other
fluxes. Such a state is non-supersymmetric and appears to describe a vacuum
with dynamical breaking of supersymmetry. Based on these considerations, we
construct a phase diagram for this theory exhibiting various interesting
regions.

  Dynamic",,,,,"cs.LG cs.GT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  In this paper, we propose a path following replicator dynamic, and
investigate its potentials in uncovering the underlying cluster structure of a
graph. The proposed dynamic is a generalization of the discrete replicator
dynamic. The replicator dynamic has been successfully used to extract dense
clusters of graphs; however, it is often sensitive to the degree distribution
of a graph, and usually biased by vertices with large degrees, thus may fail to
detect the densest cluster. To overcome this problem, we introduce a dynamic
parameter, called path parameter, into the evolution process. The path
parameter can be interpreted as the maximal possible probability of a current
cluster containing a vertex, and it monotonically increases as evolution
process proceeds. By limiting the maximal probability, the phenomenon of some
vertices dominating the early stage of evolution process is suppressed, thus
making evolution process more robust. To solve the optimization problem with a
fixed path parameter, we propose an efficient fixed point algorithm. The time
complexity of the path following replicator dynamic is only linear in the
number of edges of a graph, thus it can analyze graphs with millions of
vertices and tens of millions of edges on a common PC in a few minutes.
Besides, it can be naturally generalized to hypergraph and graph with edges of
different orders. We apply it to four important problems: maximum clique
problem, densest k-subgraph problem, structure fitting, and discovery of
high-density regions. The extensive experimental results clearly demonstrate
its advantages, in terms of robustness, scalability and flexility.

the explanation of fermion mass hierarchies by wave function overlaps, the
emergence of tribimaximal (TBM) neutrino mixing and zero quark mixing at the
leading order and the absence of tree-level gauge mediated flavor violation.
Quark mixing and deviations from TBM neutrino mixing are induced by the
presence of bulk A$_4$ flavons, which allow for ""cross-brane"" interactions and
a ""cross-talk"" between the quark and neutrino sectors. In this work, we study
the constraints associated with the recent measurements of $\theta_{13}\approx
9^\circ$ by RENO and Daya Bay, forcing every model that predicts TBM neutrino
mixing to account for the significant deviation of $\theta_{13}$ from 0, while
keeping the values of $\theta_{12}$ and $\theta_{23}$ close to their central
experimental values. We then proceed to study in detail the RS-A$_4$
contributions to $\mu\to e,3e$, generated at the tree level by virtue of
anomalous $Z$ couplings. These couplings arise from gauge and fermionic KK
mixing effects after electroweak symmetry breaking. Since the experimental
sensitivity for $BR(\mu\to e,3e)$ is expected to increase by five orders of
magnitude within the next decade, it is shown that the RS-A$_4$ lepton sector
can be significantly constrained. Finally, we show that when ""cross-brane""
interactions are turned off, the $Z$ couplings are protected against all
anomalous contributions and a strong correlation between $\theta_{13}$ and the
deviation from maximality of $\theta_{23}$ is found.

planet hosts in our Galaxy. Furthermore, terrestrial planets in the habitable
zones (HZs) around M-dwarfs can potentially be characterized in the near future
and hence may be the first such planets to be studied. Recently Dressing &
Charbonneau(2013) used Kepler data and calculated the frequency of terrestrial
planets in the HZ of cool stars to be 0.15^{+0.13}_{-0.06} per star for
Earth-size planets (0.5-1.4 R_{Earth}). However, this estimate was derived
using the Kasting et al.(1993) HZ limits, which were not valid for stars with
effective temperatures lower than 3700 K. Here we update their result using new
HZ limits from Kopparapu et al.(2013) for stars with effective temperatures
between 2600 K and 7200 K, which includes the cool M stars in the Kepler target
list. The new habitable zone boundaries increase the number of planet
candidates in the habitable zone. Assuming Earth-size planets as 0.5 - 1.4
R_{Earth}, when we reanalyze their results, we obtain a terrestrial planet
frequency of 0.48^{+0.12}_{-0.24} and 0.53^{+0.08}_{-0.17} planets per M-dwarf
star for conservative and optimistic limits of the HZ boundaries, respectively.
Assuming Earth-size planets as 0.5 - 2 R_{Earth}, the frequency increases to
0.51^{+0.10}_{-0.20} per star for the conservative estimate and to
0.61^{+0.07}_{-0.15} per star for the optimistic estimate. Within
uncertainties, our optimistic estimates are in agreement with a similar
optimistic estimate from the radial velocity survey of M-dwarfs
(0.41^{+0.54}_{-0.13}, Bonfils et al.(2011)). So, the potential for finding
Earth-like planets around M stars may be higher than previously reported.

the study of Dirac points was achieved through direct numerical diagonalization

However, gas-solid coupling and the corresponding fluid flow solver remain

consider the effect of both the local solid volume fraction and the local
relative velocity between particles and fluid, which is different from the
traditional volume-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. A time-driven hard sphere
algorithm is combined to simulate the motion of individual particles, in which
particles interact with each other via hard-sphere collisions, the collision
detection and motion of particles are performed at constant time intervals. The
EMMS (energy minimization multi-scale) drag is coupled with the lattice
Boltzmann based discrete particle simulation to improve the accuracy. Two
typical fluidization processes, namely, a single bubble injection at incipient
fluidization and particle clustering in a fast fluidized bed riser, are
simulated with this approach, with the results showing a good agreement with
published correlations and experimental data. The capability of the approach to
capture more detailed and intrinsic characteristics of particle-fluid systems

critical separation is $\approx 1.04 $AU, and scales weakly with mass accretion
rate and Rosseland mean opacity ($\propto [\dot{M}\kappa_R]^{2/9}$). Assuming a

describe a method that partitions the nodes based on the componentwise ratio of
the replicator's second eigenvector to the first, and compare its performance
to traditional spectral clustering techniques on synthetic graphs with known
community structure. We demonstrate that the replicator gives preference to
dense, clique-like structures, enabling it to more effectively discover

superbubble energetics to compensate for radiative cooling. We first adapt
Kompaneets formalism for expanding bubbles in a stratified medium to the case
of continuous energy injection and include the effects of radiative cooling in
the shell. With the help of hydrodynamic simulations, we then study the
evolution of superbubbles evolving in stratified disks with typical disk
parameters. We identify two crucial energy injection rates that differ in their
effects, the corresponding breakout ranging from being gentle to a vigorous
one. (a) Superbubbles that break out of the disk with a Mach number of order
2-3 correspond to an energy injection rate of order 10^{-4} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1},
which is relevant for disk galaxies with synchrotron emitting gas in the
extra-planar regions. (b) A larger energy injection threshold, of order 10^{-3}
erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}, or equivalently, a star formation surface density of \sim
0.1 solar mass yr^{-1} kpc^{-2}, corresponds to superbubbles with a Mach number
\sim 5-10. While the milder superbubbles can be produced by large OB
associations, the latter kind requires super-starclusters. These derived
conditions compare well with observations of disk galaxies with winds and the
existence of multiphase halo gas. Furthermore, we find that contrary to the
general belief that superbubbles fragment through Rayleigh-Taylor (RT)
instability when they reach a vertical height of order the scale height, the
superbubbles are first affected by thermal instability for typical disk
parameters and that RT instability takes over when the shells reach a distance
of approximately twice the scale height.

stellar plasma temperatures and occurs mainly in explosive O/Ne burning during
a core-collapse supernova. Although the gamma-process in massive stars has been

remain. An increasing number of processes and sites has been studied in recent

thus the nuclear input may also bear considerable uncertainties. The current

Meteoritic data not only provide the actual isotopic abundances of the p-nuclei

twice as many blue stragglers than a selection criterion that was developed for
observations of real clusters. However, the two numbers of blue stragglers are
well-correlated, so either selection criterion can be used to characterize the

simplified prescription for the evolution of a collision or merger product in
the BSE code overestimates their lifetimes. We show that our model blue
stragglers follow similar trends with cluster properties (core mass, binary

long as we restrict ourselves to model clusters with an initial binary fraction
higher than 5%. We also show that, in contrast to earlier work, the number of

multi-operator insertions was motivated as a step towards applying on-shell
techniques to compute correlation functions at strong coupling. In this
picture, each operator is associated to a monodromy condition on the cusp
solutions. We construct Y-systems for both cases. The Y-functions are related
to the spacetime (cross) ratios. Their WKB approximations based on a rational
function P(z) are also studied. We focus on the short operators, while the
prescription is hopefully also applicable for more general operators.

of the scallop theorem, which dictate that body kinematics identical under a
time-reversal symmetry (in particular, those with a single degree of freedom)
cannot display locomotion on average. The implications of the theorem naturally
compel one to ask whether similar symmetry constraints exist for locomotion in
different environments. In this work we consider locomotion along a surface
where forces are described by isotropic Coulomb friction. To address whether
motions with a single degree of freedom can lead to transport, we analyze a
model system consisting of two bodies whose separation distance undergoes
periodic time variations. The behavior of the two-body system is entirely
determined by the kinematic specification of their separation, the friction
forces, and the mass of each body. We show that the constraints of the scallop
theorem can be escaped in frictional media if two asymmetry conditions are met
at the same time: the frictional forces of each body against the surface must
be distinct and the time-variation of the body-body separation must vary
asymmetrically in time (so quick-slow or slow-quick in the
extension-contraction phases). Our results are demonstrated numerically and
interpreted using asymptotic expansions.

starting from any ""finite-dimensional"" Markov transition function p_t, on a
measurable state space (E,B), we construct a strong Markov process on a certain
""intrinsic"" state space that is, in fact, a closed subset of a finite
dimensional Euclidean space R^d. Of course we must explain the meaning of
finite-dimensionality and intrinsity. Starting with p_t, we consider the range
of the nonnegative bounded measurable functions under the action of the
resolvent. This class of functions induces a uniform structure on E. We say
that E is finite-dimensional if this uniformity is finitely generated. In such
cases we then map E into R^d. The intrinsic state space is the closure of the
range of this mapping. On this enlarged state space we construct a strong
Markov process, which corresponds quite naturally to p_t. We give several
examples including the usual examples of nonstrong Markov process.

ability to defend the overall system instead of individual computers. The
current architecture enables all nodes in the computer network to communicate
transparently with one another, so security would require protecting every
computer in the network from all possible attacks. In contrast, other systems
depend on system-wide protections. In providing conventional security, police
patrol neighborhoods and the military secures borders, rather than defending
each individual household. Likewise, in biology, the immune system provides
security against viruses and bacteria using primarily action at the skin,
membranes, and blood, rather than requiring each cell to defend itself. We
propose applying these same principles to address the cybersecurity challenge.
This will require: (a) Enabling pervasive distribution of self-propagating
securityware and creating a developer community for such securityware, and (b)
Modifying the protocols of internet routers to accommodate adaptive security
software that would regulate internet traffic. The analysis of the immune
system architecture provides many other principles that should be applied to
cybersecurity. Among these principles is a careful interplay of detection and
action that includes evolutionary improvement. However, achieving significant
security gains by applying these principles depends strongly on remedying the
underlying architectural limitations.

topological invariance must be modified when time-reversal symmetry is broken,

have a dark matter fraction of about 0.6\pm0.1 at 5R_e (70% C.L.), and are
embedded in a dark matter halo with circular velocity ~200 km/s. The total
circular velocity curve (CVC) is approximately flat at v_c=220 km/s outside

results are independent of the assumed inclination of the galaxy, and edge-on

velocity dispersion profiles also decrease rapidly from the center outwards,
the outer CVCs and dark matter halos are quite similar. NGC 4494 shows a
particularly high dark matter fraction inside ~3R_e, and a strong concentration

that the first ETGs to form at z>2 are all compact or ultra-compact, while
normal sized ETGs (meaning ETGs with sizes comparable to those of local
counterparts of the same mass) are the most common ETGs only at z<1. The
increase of the average size of ETGs at 0<z<1 is primarily driven by the
appearance of new large ETGs rather than by the size increase of individual

simulated pairs with the observed LG at the 1-sigma level in the uncertainties
has been done with respect to the radial and tangential velocities, the reduced
orbital energy (e_tot), angular momentum (l_orb) and the dimensionless spin
parameter, lambda. Our main results are: (i) the preferred radial and
tangential velocities for pairs in LCDM are v_rad=-80+/-20 km/s, v_tan=50+/-10
km/s, (ii) pairs around that region are 3 to 13 times more common than pairs
within the observational values, (iii) 15%to 24% of LG-like pairs in LCDM have
energy and angular momentum consistent with observations while (iv) 9% to 13%
of pairs in the same sample show similar values in the inferred dimensionless
spin parameter. It follows that within current observational uncertainties the
quasi-conserved quantities that characterize the orbit of the LG, i.e. e_tot,
r_orb and lambda, do not challenge the standard LCDM model, but the model is in
tension with regard to the actual values of the radial and tangential

should be visible near the center of the SN remnant and may show some unusual
features. A promising approach to test progenitor models of SNe Ia is to search
for the companion in SNRs. Here we present the results of 3D hydrodynamics
simulations of the interaction between the SN Ia blast wave and a MS companion
taking into consideration its orbital motion and spin. The primary goal of this
work is to investigate the rotation of surviving companions after SN Ia
explosions in the WD+MS scenario. We use Eggleton's code including the
optically thick accretion wind model to obtain realistic models of companions.
The impact of the SN blast wave on these companions is followed in 3D
hydrodynamic simulations employing the SPH code GADGET3. We find that the
rotation of the companion does not significantly affect the amount of stripped
mass and the kick velocity caused by the SN impact. However, in our
simulations, the rotational velocity of the companion is significantly reduced
to about 14% to 32% of its pre-explosion value due to the expansion of the
companion and the fact that 55%-89% of the initial angular momentum is carried
away by the stripped matter. Compared with the observed rotational velocity of
the presumed companion star of Tycho's SN, Tycho G, of 6 km/s the final
rotational velocity we obtain is still higher by at least a factor of two.
Whether this difference is significant, and may cast doubts on the suggestion
that Tycho G is the companion of SN 1572, has to be investigated in future
studies. Based on binary population synthesis results we present, for the first
time, the expected distribution of rotational velocities of companions after
the explosion which may provide useful information for the identification of
the surviving companion in observational searches in other historical SNRs.

of planetesimal and protoplanet formation. Because objects this large are
decoupled from the accretion flow, when they form, they can lock up water (and
oxygen) beyond the snow line, thereby enhancing the C/O ratio in the inner disk
and altering the molecular abundances there. We discuss the assumptions that
underlie this interpretation, a possible alternative explanation, and related
open questions that motivate future work. Whatever its origin, understanding
the meaning of the relation between the HCN/H2O ratio and disk mass is of

can be approximated by a piecewise linear curve to arbitrary accuracy. The

the rotational variability in line profiles to elemental surface distributions.
Assuming a centered, dominantly dipolar magnetic field configuration, we find
that Li, O, Mg, Pr, and Nd are mainly concentrated in the area of the magnetic

abundance spots of Si, La, Ce, Eu, and Gd are located between the magnetic
poles and the magnetic equator. Except for La, which is clearly depleted in the
area of the magnetic poles, no obvious correlation with the magnetic field has

between the magnetic and the rotational equator constitutes an exception,

believed that such ""fast cooling"" electrons have an energy distribution $dN_e

shadowed from the quasar UV radiation due to obscuration effects, which are
frequently invoked in unified models of AGN. Small-scale R_perp <~ 50 kpc
extended Ly-a nebulosities are detected in 34% of our sample, which are likely
the high-redshift analogs of the extended emission-line regions commonly
observed around low-redshift (z < 0.5) quasars. We also detect a compact high
rest-frame equivalent width (W_Lya > 50 A) Ly-alpha-emitter with luminosity
L_Lya =2.1+-0.32e41 erg/s at small impact parameter R_perp=134 kpc from one
foreground quasar, and argue that it is more likely to result from
quasar-powered fluorescence, than simply be a star-forming galaxy clustered
around the quasar. Our observations imply that much deeper integrations with
upcoming integral-field spectrometers such as MUSE and KCWI will be able to
routinely detect a diffuse Ly-a glow around bright quasars on scales R ~ 100
kpc and thus directly image the CGM. [abridged]

(S_843MHz<6mJy) or far-infrared counterparts (S_100um<1 Jy, S_60um<200mJy). We
robustly detect 44 line features in our survey, which we identify as redshifted
emission lines of 12CO, 13CO, [CI], H2O, and H2O+. We find one or more spectral
features in 23 sources yielding a ~90% detection rate for this survey; in 12 of

secure redshifts for ~70% of the sample. The three sources with no lines
detected are tentatively placed in the redshift desert between 1.7<z<2.0. The

significantly lower mean redshift of <z>=2.3 and for which only 10-15% of the
population is expected to be at z>3. We discuss the effect of gravitational
lensing on the redshift distribution and compare our measured redshift

exact on models without a fermion sign problem, such as the one we consider. We
determine the interaction-dependence of the Z2 topological insulator/trivial

larger values of third-neighbor hopping, thus stabilizing the topological

minimizes the ratio between the fraction of $G$-edges that are cut and the
fraction of $H$-edges that are cut. The ratio (which is at most 1 in an optimal

find a solution to the uniform sparsest cut of cost $O(\sqrt{opt})$ in nearly

  We show that the answer is negative, assuming the Unique Games Conjecture,

the spectral relaxation fail to find such an approximation even if $H$ is a

protection against an adversary that uses their partial view of the

of the codeword components to ""see"", and then ""adds"" an adversarial error
vector of weight \rho_wN to the codeword. Performance of the code is measured
by the probability of the decoder failure in recovering the sent message. An

  We formalize the definition of adversarial error and decoder failure,
construct a code with efficient encoding and decoding that allows the adversary
to, depending on the code rate, read up to half of the sent codeword and add
error on the same coordinates. The code is non-linear, has an efficient
decoding algorithm, and is constructed using a message authentication code
(MAC) and a Folded Reed-Solomon (FRS) code. The decoding algorithm uses an
innovative approach that combines the list decoding algorithm of the FRS codes
and the MAC verification algorithm to eliminate the exponential size of the
list output from the decoding algorithm. We discuss application of our results

group ellipticity, a statistically significant (~ 5\sigma) major-axis alignment
is detected and the alignment angle is found to be 43.0 \pm 0.4 degrees. More
massive and richer groups show stronger BSG alignment. The BSG alignment around
blue BCGs is slightly stronger than that around red BCGs. And red BSGs have
much stronger major-axis alignment than blue BSGs. Unlike BSGs, other
satellites do not show very significant alignment with group major axis. We
further explore the BSG alignment in semi-analytic model (SAM) constructed by
Guo et al. (2011). We found general good agreement with observations: BSGs in
SAM show strong major-axis alignment which depends on group mass and richness
in the same way as observations; and none of other satellites exhibit prominent
alignment. However, discrepancy also exists in that the SAM shows opposite BSG
color dependence, which is most probably induced by the missing of large scale
environment ingredient in SAM. The combination of two popular scenarios can
explain the detected BSG alignment. The first one: satellites merged into the
group preferentially along the surrounding filaments, which is strongly aligned
with the major axis of the group. The second one: BSGs enter their host group
more recently than other satellites, then will preserve more information about
the assembling history and so the major-axis alignment. In SAM, we found
positive evidence for the second scenario by the fact that BSGs merged into
groups statistically more recently than other satellites. On the other hand,
although is opposite in SAM, the BSG color dependence in observation might
indicate the first scenario as well.

We present many-body calculations which demonstrate that the energy splitting
of these states is particularly sensitive to violations of both special and

$10^{-17}$, matching or improving the best laboratory and astrophysical limits

called ""Reg PT"", and the standard perturbation theory. Reg PT is one of the
most successful models to describe nonlinear evolution of dark matter
fluctuations. However, Reg PT is a mathematically unproven interpolation
formula between the large-scale solution calculated by the standard
perturbation theory and the limiting solution in the small scale calculated by
the multi-point propagator method. In this paper, we give an alternative
explanation for Reg PT in the context of the standard perturbation theory,
showing that Reg PT does not ever have more effective information on nonlinear
matter evolution than the standard perturbation theory. In other words, the
solutions of the standard perturbation theory reproduce the results of $N$-body
simulations better than those of Reg PT, especially at the high-$k$ region.
This fact means that the standard perturbation theory at the two-loop level is
still one of the best predictions of the nonlinear power spectrum to date.
Nevertheless, the standard perturbation theory has not been preferred because
of the divergent behavior of the solution at small scales. To solve this
problem, we also propose a modified standard perturbation theory which avoids
the divergence.

running along the large-scale galactic bar, as well as in the circumnuclear

find such gas concentrated in two knots where the dust lanes make contact with
the circumnuclear starburst ring. When convolved to the same angular resolution
as the images in dense gas, the radio continuum emission of the circumnuclear
starburst ring also exhibits two knots, each lying downstream of an adjacent
knot in dense gas. The results agree qualitatively with the idea that massive
stars form from dense gas at the contact points, where diffuse gas is channeled
into the ring along the dust lanes, and later explode as supernovae downstream
of the contact points. Based on the inferred rotation curve, however, the
propagation time between the respective pairs of dense gas and centimeter
continuum knots is about an order of magnitude shorter than the lifetimes of OB
stars. We discuss possible reasons of this discrepancy, and conclude that
either the initial mass function is top-heavy or massive stars in the ring do
not form exclusively at the contact points where dense molecular gas is

signaling involves not only the signal covariance matrix as in the conventional

pseudo-covariance matrix, which is conventionally set to zero in proper
Gaussian signaling. By exploiting the separable rate expression with improper
Gaussian signaling, we propose a separate transmit covariance and
pseudo-covariance optimization algorithm, which is guaranteed to improve the
users' achievable rates over the conventional proper Gaussian signaling. In
particular, for the pseudo-covariance optimization, we establish the optimality
of rank-1 pseudo-covariance matrices, given the optimal rank-1 transmit
covariance matrices for achieving the Pareto boundary of the rate region. Based
on this result, we are able to greatly reduce the number of variables in the
pseudo-covariance optimization problem and thereby develop an efficient
solution by applying the celebrated semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique.
Finally, we extend the result to the Gaussian MISO broadcast channel (MISO-BC)

These models are supported by the direct numerical simulation of compressible

illumination, pose and expression. While local feature based representations
are considerably more robust to such variations, they have received little
attention within the image set matching area. We propose a novel image set
matching technique, comprised of three aspects: (i) robust descriptors of face
regions based on local features, partly inspired by the hierarchy in the human
visual system, (ii) use of several subspace and exemplar metrics to compare
corresponding face regions, (iii) jointly learning which regions are the most
discriminative while finding the optimal mixing weights for combining metrics.

how well they detect seeded defects (mutants). Even though well established in
research, mutation analysis is rarely used in practice due to scalability
problems --- there are multiple mutations per code statement leading to a large
number of mutants, and hence executions of the test suite. In addition, the use
of mutation to improve test suites is futile for mutants that are equivalent,
which means that there exists no test case that distinguishes them from the
original program.
  This paper introduces two optimizations based on state infection conditions,
i.e., conditions that determine for a test execution whether the same execution
on a mutant would lead to a different state. First, redundant test execution
can be avoided by monitoring state infection conditions, leading to an overall
performance improvement. Second, state infection conditions can aid in
identifying equivalent mutants, thus guiding efforts to improve test suites.

cylindrical piston are performed to get better physical insight into the
initiation and evolution of large-scale coronal waves. Several very basic
initial configurations are employed to analyze intrinsic characteristics of the
MHD wave formation that do not depend on specific properties of the
environment. It turns out that these simple initial configurations result in
piston/wave morphologies and kinematics that reproduce common characteristics
of coronal waves. In the initial stage the wave and the expanding source-region
cannot be clearly resolved. During the acceleration stage of the source-region
inflation, the wave is driven by the piston expansion, so its amplitude and
phase-speed increase, whereas the wavefront profile steepens. At a given point,
a discontinuity forms in the wavefront profile. The time/distance required for
the shock formation is shorter for a more impulsive source-region expansion.
After the piston stops, the wave amplitude and phase-speed start decreasing.
During the expansion, most of the source region becomes strongly rarified,
which reproduces the coronal dimming left behind the eruption. On the other
hand, the density increases at the source-region boundary, and stays enhanced
even after the expansion stops, which might explain stationary brightenings
that are sometimes observed at the edges of the erupted coronal structure. In
addition, in the rear of the wave a weak density depletion develops, trailing
the wave, which is sometimes observed as weak transient coronal dimming.
Finally, we find a well defined relationship between the impulsiveness of the
source-region expansion and the wave amplitude and phase speed. The results for
the cylindrical piston are also compared with the outcome for a planar wave, to
find out how different geometries affect the evolution of the wave.

greatly affecting the pulsar radio emission and polarization. The two effects
have not been considered simultaneously in the literature, however, each one of
these has been considered separately and deduced the picture by simply
superposing them, but such an approach can lead to spurious results. Hence by
considering pulsar rotation and PC--current perturbations together instead of
one at a time we have developed a single particle curvature radiation model,
which is expected to be much more realistic. By simulating a set of typical
pulse profiles we have made an attempt to explain most of the observational
results on pulsar radio emission and polarization. The model predicts that due
to the perturbations leading side component can become either stronger or
weaker than the corresponding trailing one in any given cone depending on the
passage of sight line and modulation (nonuniform source distribution). Further
we find that the phase delay of polarization angle inflection point with
respect to the core component greatly depends upon the viewing geometry. The
correlation between the sign reversal of circular polarization and the
polarization angle swing in the case of core dominated pulsars become obscure
once the perturbations and modulation become significant. However the
correlation that the negative circular polarization associates with the
increasing polarization angle and vice versa shows up very clearly in the case
of conal-double pulsars. The `kinky' type distortions in polarization angle
swing could be due to the incoherent superposition of modulated emissions in
the presence of strong perturbations.

three problems representing three different Q-learning algorithms: namely,
centralized, distributed and partially distributed power control using
Q-learning (CPC-Q, DPC-Q and PDPC-Q). CPCQ, although not of practical interest,
characterizes the global optimum. Each of DPC-Q and PDPC-Q works in two
different learning paradigms: Independent (IL) and Cooperative (CL). The former
is considered the simplest form for applying Qlearning in multi-agent
scenarios, where all the femtocells learn independently. The latter is the
proposed scheme in which femtocells share partial information during the
learning process in order to strike a balance between practical relevance and
performance. In terms of performance, the simulation results showed that the CL
paradigm outperforms the IL paradigm and achieves an aggregate femtocells
capacity that is very close to the optimal one. For the practical relevance
issue, we evaluate the robustness and scalability of DPC-Q, in real time, by
deploying new femtocells in the system during the learning process, where we
showed that DPC-Q in the CL paradigm is scalable to large number of femtocells

closely related to the space of extremal characters of the infinite symmetric
group. In another context, the Thoma cone appears as the set of parameters for
totally positive, upper triangular Toeplitz matrices of infinite size.
  The purpose of the paper is to construct a family of continuous time Markov
processes on the Thoma cone, depending on two continuous parameters. Our
construction largely exploits specific properties of the Thoma cone related to
its representation-theoretic origin, although we do not use representations
directly. On the other hand, we were inspired by analogies with random matrix
theory coming from models of Markov dynamics related to orthogonal polynomial
ensembles.
  We show that our processes possess a number of nice properties, namely: (1)
every process X is a Feller process; (2) the infinitesimal generator of X, its
spectrum, and the eigenfunctions admit an explicit description; (3) in the
equilibrium regime, the finite-dimensional distributions of X can be
interpreted as (the laws of) infinite-particle systems with determinantal
correlations; (4) the corresponding time-dependent correlation kernel admits an
explicit expression, and its structure is similar to that of time-dependent
correlation kernels appearing in random matrix theory.

of statistics research that has received a lot of attention in the recent
years. More recently, a new and attractive application of this type of models
has been to obtain individualized predictions of survival probabilities and/or
of future longitudinal responses. The advantageous feature of these predictions
is that they are dynamically updated as extra longitudinal responses are
collected for the subjects of interest, providing real time risk assessment
using all recorded information. The aim of this paper is two-fold. First, to
highlight the importance of modeling the association structure between the
longitudinal and event time responses that can greatly influence the derived
predictions, and second, to illustrate how we can improve the accuracy of the
derived predictions by suitably combining joint models with different
association structures. The second goal is achieved using Bayesian model
averaging, which, in this setting, has the very intriguing feature that the
model weights are not fixed but they are rather subject- and time-dependent,
implying that at different follow-up times predictions for the same subject may
be based on different models.

this compound. The observed weak temperature dependence of the magnetic
susceptibility and its low value indicate that Ce ions are in valence
fluctuating state. The formal $L_{III}$ Ce valence in CeMo$_{2}$Si$_{2}$C
$<$$\widetilde{\nu}$$>$ = 3.11 as determined from x-ray absorption spectroscopy
measurement is well bellow the value $<$$\widetilde{\nu}$$> \simeq$ 3.4 in

does not show any anomaly down to 1.8 K which rules out any magnetic ordering
in the system. The Sommerfeld coefficient obtained from the specific heat data
is $\gamma$ = 23.4 mJ/mol\,K$^{2}$. The electrical resistivity follows the
$T{^2}$ behavior in the low temperature range below 35 K confirming a Fermi
liquid behavior. Accordingly both the Kadowaki Wood ratio $A/\gamma^{2}$ and
the Sommerfeld Wilson ratio $\chi(0)/\gamma$ are in the range expected for
Fermi-liquid systems. In order to get some information on the electronic
states, we calculated the band structure within the density functional theory,

non-$f$ electron states crossing the Fermi level have mostly Mo 4d character.

  Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search of RCTs in RMS. Data on
eligibility criteria and baseline characteristics were extracted and tested for
significant trends over time. A meta-regression was conducted to estimate their
contribution to the decrease of trial ARRs over time.
  Results: We identified 56 studies. Patient age at baseline (p < 0.001), mean
duration of multiple sclerosis (MS) at baseline (p = 0.048), size of treatment
groups (p = 0.003), Oxford Quality Scale scores (p = 0.021), and the number of
eligibility criteria (p<0.001) increased significantly, whereas pre-trial ARR
(p = 0.001), the time span over which pre-trial ARR was calculated (p < 0.001),
and the duration of placebo-controlled follow-up (p = 0.006) decreased
significantly over time. In meta-regression of trial placebo ARR, the temporal
trend was found to be insignificant, with major factors explaining the
variation: pre-trial ARR, the number of years used to calculate pre-trial ARR
and study duration. Conclusion: The observed decline in trial ARRs may result
from decreasing pre-trial ARRs and a shorter time period over which pre-trial
ARRs were calculated. Increasing patient age and duration of illness may also
contribute.

this respect, it is shown how the techniques recently developed to solve the
consensus problem among linear agents can be extended to agents modeled by
nonlinear d-dimensional differential equations, under the assumption that the

posterior distribution, the rate of convergence often decreases exponentially
as a function of the length of the DNA sequence. Specifically, we show that
this occurs whenever there is more than one true repeating pattern in the data.
In practice there are typically multiple such patterns in biological data, the
goal being to detect the most well-conserved and frequently-occurring of these.
Our findings match empirical results, in which the motif-discovery Gibbs
sampler has exhibited such poor convergence that it is used only for finding
modes of the posterior distribution (candidate motifs) rather than for
obtaining samples from that distribution. Ours are some of the first meaningful
bounds on the convergence rate of a Markov chain method for sampling from a
multimodal posterior distribution, as a function of statistical quantities like
the number of observations.

to properly allocating the available power over the established links.
Unfortunately, finding the solution of this problem is numerically difficult as

rely on the computation of upper- and lower-bounds that are hard to obtain or
require the relaxation of the QoS constraints. In this work, a novel approach
is devised for both linear and non-linear transceiver architectures, which
allows to closely approximate the solutions of the non-convex power allocation

a major loss process. Biological light harvesting complexes (LHCs) prevent
recombination via the use of cascade structures, which lead to spatial
separation of charge-carriers1. In contrast, the nanoscale morphology and high
charge densities in organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) give a high rate of
electron-hole encounters, which should result in the formation of spin triplet
excitons, as in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs)2. OPVs would have poor
quantum efficiencies if every encounter lead to recombination, but
state-of-the-art OPVs demonstrate near-unity quantum efficiency3. Here we show
that this suppression of recombination can be engineered through the interplay
between spin, energetics and delocalisation of electronic excitations in
organic semiconductors. We use time-resolved spectroscopy to study a series of
model, high efficiency polymer-fullerene systems in which the lowest lying
molecular triplet exciton (T1) (on the polymer) lies below the intermolecular
charge transfer state (CT). We observe the formation of T1 states following
bimolecular recombination, indicating that encounters of spin-uncorrelated
electrons and holes generate CT states with both spin singlet (1CT) and spin
triplet (3CT) characters. We show that triplet exciton formation can be the
major loss mechanism in OPVs. However, we find that even when energetically
favoured, the relaxation of 3CT to T1 can be strongly suppressed, via control
over wavefunction delocalisation, allowing for the dissociation of 3CT back to
free changes, thereby reducing recombination and enhancing device performance.
Our results point towards new design rules for artificial photo-conversion
systems, enabling the suppression of electron-hole recombination, and also for
OLEDs, avoiding the formation of triplet states and enhancing fluorescence
efficiency.

Prediction Error Methods (PEM). In this context, model complexity is often
unknown so that a model order selection step is needed to suitably trade-off
bias and variance. Recently, a different approach to linear system
identification has been introduced, where model order determination is avoided
by using a regularized least squares framework. In particular, the penalty term
on the impulse response is defined by so called stable spline kernels. They
embed information on regularity and BIBO stability, and depend on a small
number of parameters which can be estimated from data. In this paper, we
provide new nonsmooth formulations of the stable spline estimator. In
particular, we consider linear system identification problems in a very broad
context, where regularization functionals and data misfits can come from a rich
set of piecewise linear quadratic functions. Moreover, our anal- ysis includes
polyhedral inequality constraints on the unknown impulse response. For any

solve the system identification problem, with complexity O(n3)+O(mn2) in each
iteration, where n and m are the number of impulse response coefficients and
measurements, respectively. The usefulness of the framework is illustrated via

reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics, while viewing quantum states as
ordinary probability distributions over underlying objects called ""ontic
states."" Regardless of one's philosophical views about such theories, the
question arises of whether one can cleanly rule them out, by proving no-go
theorems analogous to the Bell Inequality. In the 1960s, Kochen and Specker
(who first studied these theories) constructed an elegant psi-epistemic theory
for Hilbert space dimension d=2, but also showed that any deterministic
psi-epistemic theory must be ""measurement contextual"" in dimensions 3 and
higher. Last year, the topic attracted renewed attention, when Pusey, Barrett,
and Rudolph (PBR) showed that any psi-epistemic theory must ""behave badly under
tensor product."" In this paper, we prove that even without the Kochen-Specker
or PBR assumptions, there are no psi-epistemic theories in dimensions d>=3 that
satisfy two reasonable conditions: (1) symmetry under unitary transformations,
and (2) ""maximum nontriviality"" (meaning that the probability distributions
corresponding to any two non-orthogonal states overlap). This no-go theorem
holds if the ontic space is either the set of quantum states or the set of
unitaries. The proof of this result, in the general case, uses some measure
theory and differential geometry. On the other hand, we also show the
surprising result that without the symmetry restriction, one can construct
maximally-nontrivial psi-epistemic theories in every finite dimension d.

we consider imperfect confinement of the wave to the device. To extract the
guided modes, we use an automatized procedure which is established in this

we discuss the nature of different optical resonances which can be potentially
used to enhance light trapping in the solar cell. We investigate the two
different polarization directions for one-dimensional gratings and we show that
the transverse magnetic polarization can provide higher values of absorption
enhancement. We also propose a way to reduce the angular dependence of the
solar cell efficiency by the appropriate choice of periodic pattern. Finally,
to get more practical values for the absorption enhancement, we consider the
effect of parasitic loss which can significantly reduce the enhancement factor.

eigenvectors on the nonsingular projective variety $\mathbb S=\{\mathbf

power of the determinant of the tensor can be expressed through the

an E-eigenvector. When a tensor $\mathcal T$ is nonsingular and symmetric, its
E-eigenvectors are exactly the singular points of a class of hypersurfaces
defined by $\mathcal T$ and a parameter. We give explicit factorization of the
discriminant of this class of hypersurfaces, which completes Cartwright and

accurately treats radiative transfer in 2-D, adapted to the study of molecular

our code in detail and discuss the accuracy of its predictions, from comparison
with well-tested codes. Theoretical line profiles are compared with the
empirical data to deduce the physical conditions in the disk by means of model
fitting.
  We conclude that our code is very efficient and produces reliable results.
The comparison of the theoretical predictions with our observations reveals
that the temperature of the Red Rectangle disk is typically ~ 100-150 K, about
twice as high as previously deduced from mm-wave observations of lower-J lines.
We discuss the relevance of these new temperature estimates for understanding
the thermodynamics and dynamics of this prototype object, as well as for
interpreting observations of other rarely studied post-AGB disks. Despite our
sophisticated treatment of the line formation, our model cannot explain the
relatively strong line-wing emission for intermediate-J transitions. We argue
that a model including a rotating disk only cannot reproduce these data and
suggest that there is an additional extended (probably bipolar) structure

moves with constant velocity, either by itself, or being dragged by a moving
trap, and intrudes into the ""large"" counterpart, the following results are

in the absence or in the presence of the trap, two-component dark-bright
solitons, scalar dark solitons, or multiple dark solitons may emerge, the
latter outcome taking place due to breakdown of the superfluidity. We present
two sets of analytical results to describe this phenomenology. In an
intermediate velocity regime, where dark-bright solitons form, a reduction of
the two-component Gross-Pitaevskii system to an integrable Mel'nikov system is
developed, demonstrating that solitary waves of the former are very accurately

formation of dark solitons and multi-soliton trains, an effective

formation properties of galaxies at the present cosmological epoch. We
investigate the relationships between atomic neutral gas and newly formed stars
in different environments, across many morphological types, and over a wide
range of stellar masses adopting an updated calibration of the HI deficiency
parameter. Studying the mean properties of late-type galaxies in the Local
Supercluster, we find that galaxies in increasing local galaxy density
conditions (or decreasing projected angular separation from M87) show a
significant decrease in the HI content and in the mean specific star formation
rate, along with a progressive reddening of their stellar populations. The
gradual quenching of the star formation occurs outside-in, consistently with
the predictions of the ram pressure model. Once considered as a whole, the
Virgo cluster is effective in removing neutral hydrogen from galaxies, and this
perturbation is strong enough to appreciably reduce the SFR of its entire
galaxy population. An estimate of the present infall rate of 300-400 galaxies
per Gyr in the Virgo cluster is obtained from the number of existing HI-rich
late-type systems, assuming 200-300 Myr as the time scale for HI ablation. If
the infall process has been acting at constant rate this would imply that the
Virgo cluster has formed approximately 2 Gyr ago, consistently with the idea
that Virgo is in a young state of dynamical evolution.

use of two important tools in the geometric analysis of compact spaces, namely,
the weak maximum principle for subharmonic functions and the integration by

whereas the second one is a version for manifolds with boundary of the so
called Kelvin-Nevanlinna-Royden criterion of parabolicity. In fact, we will
show that the validity of non-compact versions of these tools serve as a
characterization of the Neumann parabolicity of the space.
  The motivation underlying this study is to obtain new information on the
geometry of graphs with prescribed mean curvature inside a Riemannian product
of the type $N\times\mathbb{R}$. In this direction two kind of results will be
presented: height estimates for constant mean curvature graphs parametrized
over unbounded domains in a complete manifold and slice type results for graphs
whose superlevel sets have finite volume.

three different energy difference measures and evaluate their impact on the

on the tradeoff between fairness and the total amount of soft constraint

radio emission comes from within an ellipse (0.235x0.218) arcsec^2 (~5x the
optical radius), with a flux density of 1.62 mJy, giving an average brightness
temperature ~1250 K. This radio photosphere contains two hotspots of 0.53 and
0.79 mJy/beam, separated by 90 milli-arcsec, with brightness temperatures
5400+/-600 K and 3800+/-500 K. Similar hotspots, at more than double the
distance from the photosphere of those seen in any other regime, were detected
by the less-sensitive `old' MERLIN in 1992, 1995 and 1996 and many exceed the
photospheric temperature of 3600 K. Such brightness temperatures are high
enough to emanate from pockets of chromospheric plasma. Other possibilities
include local shock heating, the convective dredge-up of hot material or
exceptionally cool, low density regions, transparent down to the hottest layer
at ~40 milliarcsec radius. We also detect an arc 0.2--0.3 arcsec to the SW,
brightness temperature ~150 K, in a similar direction to extensions seen on
both smaller and larger scales in the infra-red and in CO at mm wavelengths.

neither to potentials nor to a ""quantum force"" or some other dynamics, but show
that a ""systemic nonlocality"" may be obtained as a phenomenon that emerges from
an assumed sub-quantum kinematics, which is manipulated only by changing its
constraints as determined by the changes of the apparatus. Consequences are

differences between semiclassical and quantum-electrodynamical (QED) theory of

scattering patterns calculated for an electronic wavepacket in atomic hydrogen
[Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., {\bf 109}, 11636 (2012)]. In this work, we
present a detailed analysis of time-resolved x-ray scattering from a sample
containing a mixture of non-stationary and stationary electrons within both the
theories. In a many-electron system, the role of scattering interference
between a non-stationary and several stationary electrons to the total
scattering signal is investigated. In general, QED and semiclassical theory
provide different results for the contribution from the scattering
interference, which depends on the energy resolution of the detector and the
x-ray pulse duration. The present findings are demonstrated by means of a
numerical example of x-ray TRI for an electronic wavepacket in helium. It is
shown that the time-dependent scattering interference vanishes within
semiclassical theory and the corresponding patterns are dominated by the
scattering contribution from the time-independent interference, whereas the
time-dependent scattering interference contribution does not vanish in the QED
theory and the patterns are dominated by the scattering contribution from the

system with clustered multiple-antenna base stations (BSs) cooperatively
communicating with multiple single-antenna mobile terminals (MTs), where each
BS is equipped with local renewable energy generators to supply power and also
a smart meter to enable two-way energy flow with the grid. We propose a new
energy cooperation paradigm, where a group of BSs dynamically share their
renewable energy for more efficient operation via locally injecting/drawing
power to/from an aggregator with a zero effective sum-energy exchanged. Under
this new energy cooperation model, we consider the downlink transmission in one
CoMP cluster with cooperative zero-forcing (ZF) based precoding at the BSs. We
maximize the weighted sum-rate for all MTs by jointly optimizing the transmit
power allocations at cooperative BSs and their exchanged energy amounts subject
to a new type of power constraints featuring energy cooperation among BSs with
practical loss ratios. Our new setup with BSs' energy cooperation generalizes
the conventional CoMP transmit optimization under BSs' sum-power or
individual-power constraints. Finally, we validate our results by simulations
under various practical setups, and show that the proposed joint communication

CoMP systems powered by smart grid and renewable energy, as compared to other
suboptimal designs without communication and/or energy cooperation.

the fully-gapped s-wave state with (without) sign reversal between hole-like

the neuronal basis of behavior. The C. elegans nervous system, consisting of
302 neurons, whose connectivity and morphology has been mapped completely,
drives a rich repertoire of behaviors that are quantifiable by video

amenable to optogenetic interrogation. Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), halorhodopsin

describe techniques and methods for optogenetic manipulation in C. elegans. We

contributes at small $\pi^0 p$ invariant mass and could be therefore
misinterpreted as the Roper resonance. We predict strong dependence of the
slope in $t$ (squared four-momentum transfer between ingoing and outgoing

a search for the odderon contribution at midrapidity and at $p_{\perp,\pi^{0}}

manganites can be rationalized by considering the limit of infinite
intra-atomic splitting between the majority- and minority-spin states (or the
double exchange limit), which reduces the problem to the analysis of a spinless
double exchange (DE) Hamiltonian. We apply this strategy to the low-energy
model, derived from the first-principles calculations, and combine it with the
Berry-phase theory of electric polarization. We start with the simplest
two-orbital model, describing the behavior of the eg bands, and apply it to the
E-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase, which in the DE limit effectively breaks
up into one-dimensional zigzag chains. We derive an analytical expression for
the electronic polarization (Pel) and explain how it depends on the orbital
ordering and the energy splitting Delta between eg states. Then, we evaluate
parameters of this model, starting from a more general five-orbital model for
all Mn 3d bands and constructing a new downfolded model for the eg bands. From
the analysis of these parameters, we conclude that the behavior of Pel in
realistic manganites corresponds to the limit of large Delta. We further
utilize this property in order to derive an analytical expression for Pel in a
general two-fold periodic magnetic texture, based on the five-orbital model and
the perturbation-theory expansion for the Wannier functions in the first order
of 1/Delta. This expression explains the functional dependence of Pel on the
relative directions of spins. Furthermore, it suggests that Pel is related to
the asymmetry of the transfer integrals, which should simultaneously have
symmetric and antisymmetric components. Finally, we explain how the
polarization can be switched between orthorhombic directions a and c by
inverting the zigzag AFM texture in every second ab plane.

electronic origin. Broadband ultrafast spectroscopy is emerging as the premier
technique to unravel the subtle interplay between quasiparticles and electronic
or phononic collective excitations, by their different characteristic
timescales and spectral responses. By investigating the femtosecond dynamics of
the optical properties of Y-Bi2212 crystals over the 0.5-2 eV energy range, we
disentangle the electronic and phononic contributions to the generalized
electron-boson Eliashberg function, showing that the spectral distribution of
the electronic excitations, such as spin fluctuations and current loops, and
the strength of their interaction with quasiparticles can account for the high
critical temperature of the superconducting phase transition. Finally, we
discuss how the use of this technique can be extended to the underdoped region
of the phase diagram of cuprates, in which a pseudogap in the quasiparticle
density of states opens. The microscopic modeling of the interaction of
ultrashort light pulses with unconventional superconductors will be one of the
key challenges of the next-years materials science, eventually leading to the
full understanding of the role of the electronic correlations in controlling
the dynamics on the femtosecond timescale.

close vicinity of the fixed point in dense baryonic matter uncovered in hidden
local symmetry implemented with spontaneously broken scale symmetry are shown
to reveal a surprisingly intricate interplay, hitherto unsuspected, between the
origin of the bulk of proton mass and the renormalization-group flow of the
\omega-nuclear interactions. This rends a theoretical support to the previous
(phenomenologically) observed correlation between the dropping nucleon mass and
the behavior of the \omega-nuclear interactions in dense matter described in
terms of half skyrmions that appear at a density denoted $n_{1/2}$ in skyrmion
crystals. The role of the \omega-meson degree of freedom in the source for
nucleon mass observed in this paper is highly reminiscent of its important role
in the skyrmion description of nucleon mass in hidden local symmetric theory.
One of the most notable novel results found in this paper is that the nucleon
mass in dense baryonic medium undergoes a drop roughly linear in density up to
a density (denoted $\tilde{n}$) slightly above nuclear matter density ($n_0$)
and then stays more or less constant up to the dilaton limit fixed point. The
possibility that we entertain is that $\tilde{n}$ coincides with or at least
close to $n_{1/2}$. We note that this feature can be economically captured by
the parity-doublet model for nucleons with the chiral-invariant mass $m_0\sim
(0.7-0.8) m_N$. It is found in one-loop renormalization-group analysis with the
Lagrangian adopted that while the \rho-NN coupling ""runs"" in density, the
\omega-NN coupling does not scale: it will scale at two-loop or higher-loop
order, but at a slower pace, so it is more appropriate to say it ""walks"" rather
than runs.

one-form on this bundle, from which the symplectic form and a volume form are
constructed. Then, we define an appropriate Hamiltonian on the bundle which,
together with the symplectic form yields the Liouville vector field. The
corresponding flow, when projected onto the base manifold, generates geodesic
motion. Whenever the flow is restricted to energy surfaces corresponding to a
negative value of the Hamiltonian, its projection describes a family of
future-directed timelike geodesics. A collisionless gas is described by a
distribution function on such an energy surface, satisfying the Liouville
equation. Fibre integrals of the distribution function determine the particle
current density and the stress-energy tensor. We show that the stress-energy
tensor satisfies the familiar energy conditions and that both the current and
stress-energy tensor are divergence-free.

planetesimals that existed in the planetary region when planets formed. They

possibility that the Trojans were captured during the early dynamical
instability among the outer planets (aka the Nice model), when the semimajor
axis of Jupiter was changing as a result of scattering encounters with an ice
giant. The capture occurs in this model when Jupiter's orbit and its Lagrange
points become radially displaced in a scattering event and fall into a region
populated by planetesimals (that previously evolved from their natal
transplanetary disk to ~5 AU during the instability). Our numerical simulations
of the new capture model, hereafter jump capture, satisfactorily reproduce the
orbital distribution of the Trojans and their total mass. The jump capture is
potentially capable of explaining the observed asymmetry in the number of
leading and trailing Trojans. We find that the capture probability is
(6-8)x10^-7 for each particle in the original transplanetary disk, implying
that the disk contained (3-4)x10^7 planetesimals with absolute magnitude H<9
(corresponding to diameter D=80 km for a 7% albedo). The disk mass inferred
from this work, M_disk=14-28 M_Earth, is consistent with the mass deduced from
recent dynamical simulations of the planetary instability.

A significant number of the Wolf-Rayet stars seem to be binary or
multiple systems, but the nature of many of them is still unknown. Dedicated
monitoring of WR stars favours the discovery of new systems.
  Aims. We explore the possibility that WR62a is a binary system.
  Methods. We analysed the spectra of WR62a, obtained between 2002 and 2010, to
look for radial-velocity and spectral variations that would suggest there is a
binary component. We searched for periodicities in the measured radial
velocities and determined orbital solutions. A period search was also performed
on the ""All-Sky Automated Survey"" photometry.
  Results. We find that WR62a is a double-lined spectroscopic binary with a WN5
primary star and an O 5.5-6 type secondary component in orbit with a period of
9.1447 d. The minimum masses range between 21 and 23 Mo for the WN star and
between 39 and 42 Mo for the O-type star, thus indicating that the WN star is
less massive than the O-type component. We detect a phase shift in the

analysis of housing prices at the State level in the USA. The study contributes
to the existing literature by extending the use of dynamic factor models to the
econometric analysis of multivariate lattice data. One of the main advantages
of our model formulation is that by modeling the spatial variation via
spatially structured factor loadings, we entertain the possibility of
identifying similarity ""regions"" that share common time series components. The
factor loadings are modeled as conditionally independent multivariate Gaussian
Markov Random Fields, while the common components are modeled by latent dynamic
factors. The general model is proposed in a state-space formulation where both
stationary and nonstationary autoregressive distributed-lag processes for the
latent factors are considered. For the latent factors which exhibit a common
trend, and hence are cointegrated, an error correction specification of the
(vector) autoregressive distributed-lag process is proposed. Full probabilistic
inference for the model parameters is facilitated by adapting standard Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for dynamic linear models to our model
formulation. The fit of the model is discussed for a data set of 48 States for
which we model the relationship between housing prices and the macroeconomy,
using State level unemployment and per capita personal income.

possible despite the difficulty that the length of the beam crossing region
makes a precise definition of the primary vertex impossible. This difficulty is
circumvented by using an `away side' tag to specify the initial time. We review
the formalism for describing such processes, and first apply it to simple B0
mixing, noting it gives a transparent description for CP and T asymmetries. In
particular we show that three different asymmetries of the CP and T type, with
neglect of direct CP violation, are given by the same expression.

support an atomic ensemble with a large optical depth due to its small mode

ratio of the difference between the chemical potential of neutron and proton to
temperature ($\Delta\mu/T$) in heavy-ion collisions. The $\Delta\mu/T$
determined by the IBD method (IB-$\Delta\mu/T$) is compared to the results of
the isoscaling method (IS-$\Delta\mu/T$), which uses the isotopic or the
isotonic yield ratio. Similar distributions of the IB- and IS-$\Delta\mu/T$ are
found in the measured 140$A$ MeV $^{40,48}$Ca + $^{9}$Be and the $^{58,64}$Ni +
$^{9}$Be reactions. The IB- and IS-$\Delta\mu/T$ both have a distribution with
a plateau in the small mass fragments plus an increasing part in the fragments
of relatively larger mass. The IB- and IS-$\Delta\mu/T$ plateaus show
dependence on the $n/p$ ratio of the projectile. It is suggested that the
height of the plateau is decided by the difference between the neutron density
($\rho_n$) and the proton density ($\rho_p$) distributions of the projectiles,
and the width shows the overlapping volume of the projectiles in which $\rho_n$
and $\rho_p$ change very little. The difference between the IB- and
IS-$\Delta\mu/T$ is explained by the isoscaling parameters being constrained by
the many isotopes and isotones, while the IBD method only uses the yields of
two isobars. It is suggested that the IB-$\Delta\mu/T$ is more reasonable than
the IS-$\Delta\mu/T$, especially when the isotopic or isotonic ratio disobeys
the isoscaling. As to the question whether the $\Delta\mu/T$ depends on the
density or the temperature, the density dependence is preferred since the low
density can result in low temperature in the peripheral reactions.

especially the 1:6 and 2:13 mean motion resonances with Jupiter, affect comet
1P/Halley and thereby enhance the chances of meteoroid particles getting
trapped in resonance, leading to meteor outbursts in some particular years.
Comet Halley itself librated in the 2:13 resonance from 240 B.C. to 1700 A.D.
and in the 1:6 resonance from 1404 B.C. to 690 B.C., while stream particles can
survive for timescales of the order of 10,000 years and 1,000 years in the 1:6

evolution and stream structure, influencing the occurrence of Orionid
outbursts. Specifically we are able to correlate the occurrence of enhanced

proposed by Harko et al. (2011), where the gravitational Lagrangian is given by
an arbitrary function of Ricci scalar $R$ and the trace of the stress-energy
tensor $T$, have been investigated for a specific choice of $f(R, T) = f_{1}(R)
+ f_{2}(T)$ by considering time dependent deceleration parameter. The concept
of time dependent deceleration parameter (DP) with some proper assumptions
yield the average scale factor $a(t) = \sinh^{\frac{1}{n}}(\alpha t)$, where
$n$ and $\alpha$ are positive constants. For $0 < n \leq 1$, this generates a
class of accelerating models while for $n > 1$, the models of universe exhibit
phase transition from early decelerating phase to present accelerating phase
which is in good agreement with the results from recent astrophysical
observations. Our intention is to reconstruct $f(R,T)$ models inspired by this
special law for the deceleration parameter in connection with the theories of
modified gravity. In the present study we consider the cosmological constant
$\Lambda$ as a function of the trace of the stress energy-momentum-tensor, and
dub such a model ""$\Lambda(T)$ gravity"" where we have specified a certain form
of $\Lambda(T)$. Such models may display better uniformity with the
cosmological observations. The statefinder diagnostic pair $\{r,s\}$ parameter
has been embraced to characterize different phases of the universe. We also
discuss the physical consequences of the derived models.

regulatory networks. Our approach consists in adapting an established
reinforcement learning algorithm called the fitted Q iteration. This algorithm
infers the control law directly from the measurements of the system's response
to external control inputs without the use of a mathematical model of the
system. The measurement data set can either be collected from wet-lab
experiments or artificially created by computer simulations of dynamical models
of the system. The algorithm is applicable to a wide range of biological
systems due to its ability to deal with nonlinear and stochastic system
dynamics. To illustrate the application of the algorithm to a gene regulatory
network, the regulation of the toggle switch system is considered. The control
objective of this problem is to drive the concentrations of two specific
proteins to a target region in the state space.

the area of theoretical computer science. In this paper, effort has been made
to achieve a systematic classification of all n-variable Boolean functions,
where only one affine Boolean function belongs to each class. Two different
methods are proposed to achieve this classification. The first method is a
recursive procedure that uses the Cartesian product of sets starting from the
set of 1-variable Boolean function and in the second method classification is
achieved through a set of invariant bit positions with respect to an affine
function belonging to that class. The invariant bit positions also provide
information concerning the size and symmetry properties of the
classes/sub-classes, such that the members of classes/sub-classes satisfy
certain similar properties.

recovered sometimes, even without imposing any additional sparsity constraints.
In this paper, we derive conditions under which a unique non-negative solution
for such a system can exist, based on the theory of polytopes. Furthermore, we
develop the paradigm of combined sparse representations, where only a part of
the coefficient vector is constrained to be non-negative, and the rest is
unconstrained (general). We analyze the recovery of the unique, sparsest
solution, for combined representations, under three different cases of
coefficient support knowledge: (a) the non-zero supports of non-negative and
general coefficients are known, (b) the non-zero support of general
coefficients alone is known, and (c) both the non-zero supports are unknown.
For case (c), we propose the combined orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm for
coefficient recovery and derive the deterministic sparsity threshold under
which recovery of the unique, sparsest coefficient vector is possible. We
quantify the order complexity of the algorithms, and examine their performance
in exact and approximate recovery of coefficients under various conditions of
noise. Furthermore, we also obtain their empirical phase transition
characteristics. We show that the basis pursuit algorithm, with partial
non-negative constraints, and the proposed greedy algorithm perform better in
recovering the unique sparse representation when compared to their
unconstrained counterparts. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed
methods in recovering images corrupted by saturation noise.

  pages)","10.1142/S1793536913500155",,"physics.gen-ph physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An extreme-point symmetric mode decomposition (ESMD) method is proposed to
improve the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) through the following prospects: (1)
The sifting process is implemented by the aid of 1, 2, 3 or more inner
interpolating curves, which classifies the methods into ESMD_I, ESMD_II,
ESMD_III, and so on; (2) The last residual is defined as an optimal curve
possessing a certain number of extreme points, instead of general trend with at
most one extreme point, which allows the optimal sifting times and
decompositions; (3) The extreme-point symmetry is applied instead of the
envelop symmetry; (4) The data-based direct interpolating approach is developed
to compute the instantaneous frequency and amplitude. One advantage of the ESMD
method is to determine an optimal global mean curve in an adaptive way which is
better than the common least-square method and running-mean approach; another
one is to determine the instantaneous frequency and amplitude in a direct way
which is better than the Hilbert-spectrum method. These will improve the
adaptive analysis of the data from atmospheric and oceanic sciences,
informatics, economics, ecology, medicine, seismology, and so on.

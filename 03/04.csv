The AO system's wavefront sensor (WFS) measurements are used to estimate the

synchronized science camera images, the complex speckle estimates can be used
to interferometrically analyze the images, leading to an estimate of the static

rate of downlink heterogeneous cellular networks. The framework leverages
recent application of stochastic geometry to other-cell interference modeling
and analysis. The heterogeneous cellular network is modeled as the
superposition of many tiers of Base Stations (BSs) having different transmit
power, density, path-loss exponent, fading parameters and distribution, and
unequal biasing for flexible tier association. A long-term averaged maximum
biased-received-power tier association is considered. The positions of the BSs
in each tier are modeled as points of an independent Poisson Point Process
(PPP). Under these assumptions, we introduce a new analytical methodology to
evaluate the average rate, which avoids the computation of the Coverage
Probability (Pcov) and needs only the Moment Generating Function (MGF) of the
aggregate interference at the probe mobile terminal. The distinguishable
characteristic of our analytical methodology consists in providing a tractable
and numerically efficient framework that is applicable to general fading
distributions, including composite fading channels with small- and mid-scale
fluctuations. In addition, our method can efficiently handle correlated
Log-Normal shadowing with little increase of the computational complexity. The
proposed MGF-based approach needs the computation of either a single or a
two-fold numerical integral, thus reducing the complexity of Pcov-based
frameworks, which require, for general fading distributions, the computation of
a four-fold integral.

cosmic-ray-nuclei spectrum hardening above the magnetic rigidity $\sim$ 240 GV.
One natural speculation is that the primary electron spectrum also gets
hardened (possibly at $\sim 80$ GV) and the hardening partly accounts for the
electron/positron total spectrum excess discovered by ATIC, HESS and Fermi-LAT.
If it is the case, the increasing behavior of the subsequent
positron-to-electron ratio will get flattened and the spectrum hardening should
be taken into account in the joint fit of the electron/psoitron data otherwise
the inferred parameters will be biased. Our joint fits to the latest AMS-02
positron fraction data together with the PAMELA/Fermi-LAT electron/positron
spectrum data suggest that the primary electron spectrum hardening is needed in
most though not all modelings. The bounds on dark matter models have also been
investigated. In the presence of spectrum hardening of primary electrons, the
amount of dark-matter-originated electron/positron pairs needed in the modeling
is smaller. Even with such a modification, the annihilation channel $\chi\chi
\rightarrow \mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ has been tightly constrained by the Fermi-LAT
Galactic diffuse emission data. The decay channel $\chi\rightarrow

the mirror symmetry of the system which induces intermode scattering and

opens up a band gap which suppresses Klein tunneling. The DG induces also an

remains unchanged. The detailed analysis of the linear instability provided by

boundary layers, the fundamental understanding of disturbance growth in the
flat-plate boundary layer is an important issue. In the present work we
investigate the stability of boundary layer in Poiseuille flow. We normalize
pressure and time by inertial and viscous effects. The disturbances are taken
to be periodic in the spanwise direction and time. We present a set of linear
governing equations for the parabolic evolution of wavelike disturbances. Then,
we derive modified Orr-Sommerfeld equations that can be applied in the layer.
Contrary to what one might think, we find that Squire's theorem is not
applicable for the boundary layer. We find also that normalization by inertial
or viscous effects leads to the same order of stability or instability. For the
2D disturbances flow ($\theta=0$), we found the same critical Reynolds number
for our two normalizations. This value coincides with the one we know for
neutral stability of the known Orr-Sommerfeld equation. We noticed also that
for all overs values of $k$ in the case $\theta=0$ correspond the same values
of $Re_\delta$ at $c_i=0$ whatever the normalization. We therefore conclude
that in the boundary layer with a 2D-disturbance, we have the same neutral
stability curve whatever the normalization. We find also that for a flow with
hight hydrodynamic Reynolds number, the neu- tral disturbances in the boundary
layer are two-dimensional. At last, we find that transition from stability to
instability or the opposite can occur according to the Reynolds number and the
wave number.

mathematics setting. The problem involves the minimisation of a nonlinear
function defined on a finite-dimensional semimodule over an idempotent
semifield subject to linear inequality constraints. We start with an overview
of known tropical optimisation problems with linear and nonlinear objective
functions. A short introduction to tropical algebra is provided to offer a
formal framework for solving the problem under study. As a preliminary result,
a solution to a linear inequality with an arbitrary matrix is presented. We
describe an example optimisation problem drawn from project scheduling and then
offer a general representation of the problem. To solve the problem, we
introduce an additional variable and reduce the problem to the solving of a
linear inequality, in which the variable plays the role of a parameter. A
necessary and sufficient condition for the inequality to hold is used to
evaluate the parameter, whereas the solution to the inequality is considered a
solution to the problem. Based on this approach, a complete direct solution in
a compact vector form is derived for the optimisation problem under fairly
general conditions. Numerical and graphical examples for two-dimensional
problems are given to illustrate the obtained results.

calculated from the TDHF wave function after collision using the projection
operator method which has recently been proposed by Simenel (C. Simenel, Phys.
Rev. Lett. 105, 192701 (2010)). We show results of the TDHF calculations for
transfer cross sections of the reactions of $^{40,48}$Ca+$^{124}$Sn at

$^{58}$Ni+$^{208}$Pb at $E_{lab}=$ 328.4 MeV, for which measurements are
available. We find the transfer processes show different behaviors depending on
the $N/Z$ ratios of the projectile and the target, and the product of the
charge numbers, $Z_P Z_T$. When the projectile and the target have different
$N/Z$ ratios, fast transfer processes of a few nucleons towards the charge
equilibrium of the initial system occur in reactions at large impact
parameters. As the impact parameter decreases, a neck formation is responsible
for the transfer. A number of nucleons are transferred by the neck breaking
when two nuclei dissociate, leading to transfers of protons and neutrons in the
same direction. Comparing cross sections by theory and measurements, we find
the TDHF theory describes the transfer cross sections of a few nucleons
reasonably. As the number of transferred nucleons increases, the agreement
becomes less accurate. The TDHF calculation overestimates transfer cross
sections accompanying a large number of neutrons when more than one proton are
transferred. Comparing our results with those by other theories, we find the
TDHF calculations give qualitatively similar results to those of direct
reaction models such as GRAZING and Complex WKB.

Nazionale Galileo (TNG), both in the El Roque de los Muchachos Observatory
(ORM, La Palma); the 2.2m CAHA telescope, in the Calar Alto Observatory

photometry. Visible spectra together with color photometry of 2012 DA14 show
that it can be classified as an L-type asteroid, a rare spectral type with a
composition similar to that of carbonaceous chondrites. The time-series
photometry provides a rotational period of 8.95 +- 0.08 hours after the closest
approach, and there are indications that the object suffered a spin-up during
this event. The large amplitude of the light curve suggests that the object is
very elongated and irregular, with an equivalent diameter of around 18m. We
obtain an absolute magnitude of H_R = 24.5 +- 0.2, corresponding to H_V = 25.0
+- 0.2. The GTC photometry also gives H_V = 25.29 +- 0.14. Both values agree
with the value listed at the Minor Planet Center shortly after discovery. From
the absolute photometry, together with some constraints on size and shape, we
compute a geometric albedo of p_V = 0.44 +- 0.20, which is slightly above the
range of albedos known for L-type asteroids (0.082 - 0.405).

  We present the results of a pilot study for the extended MACS survey (eMACS),
a comprehensive search for distant, X-ray luminous galaxy clusters at z>0.5.
Our pilot study applies the eMACS concept to the 71 deg^2 area extended by the
ten fields of the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) Medium Deep Survey (MDS). Candidate
clusters are identified by visual inspection of PS1 images in the g,r, i, and z
bands in a 5x5 arcmin^2 region around X-ray sources detected in the ROSAT
All-Sky Survey (RASS). To test and optimize the eMACS X-ray selection criteria,
our pilot study uses the largest possible RASS database, i.e., all RASS sources
listed in the Bright and Faint Source Catalogs (BSC and FSC) that fall within
the MDS footprint. Scrutiny of PS1/MDS images for 41 BSC and 200 FSC sources
combined with dedicated spectroscopic follow-up observations results in a
sample of 11 clusters with estimated or spectroscopic redshifts of z>0.3. X-ray
follow-up observations will be crucial in order to establish robust cluster
luminosities for eMACS clusters.
  Although the small number of distant X-ray luminous clusters in the MDS does
not allow us to make firm predictions for the over 20,000 deg^2 of
extragalactic sky covered by eMACS, the identification of two extremely
promising eMACS cluster candidates at z>0.6 (both yet to be observed with
Chandra) in such a small solid angle is encouraging. Representing a tremendous
gain over the presently known two dozen such systems from X-ray, optical, and
SZ cluster surveys combined, the sample of over 100 extremely massive clusters
at z>0.5 expected from eMACS would be invaluable for the identification of the
most powerful gravitational lenses in the Universe, as well as for in-depth and
statistical studies of the physical properties of the most massive galaxy
clusters out to z~1.

jointly estimated by solving a nonlinear least-squares (NLS) problem. To this

orthogonal transformations to ensure numerical reliability. Simulations show
that the mean-squared error (MSE) of the proposed method is much smaller than

solve a system of linear equations to recover the secret parameters. Then they
concluded that their scheme is an unconditional secure scheme. Actually, note
that the authentication tag in the scheme of Oggier and Fathi is nearly linear
on the messages, so it is very easy for any malicious node to make pollution
attack in the network flow, replacing the vector of any incoming edge by linear

1.0, the temperature range of measurements was between 284 K and 314 K, and

(1) the cholesteric to smectic-A transition temperature increased on dilution
of COC by non-smectogenic 5CB in the concentration range 0.8<X<1, and (2) the
reciprocal pitch vs. 5CB concentration dependence was essentially linear, in
contrast to behaviour commonly observed in nematic-cholesteric mixtures. A
model of molecular arrangement in the mixtures, accounting for the possibility
of integration of 5CB dimers and monomers between COC molecules and presumably
explaining the experimental data, was proposed. The helical pitch of the
cholesteric mixtures remained practically unchanged upon doping by NTs, and
only slight widening of the selective reflection peaks was noted. The obtained
results allow considering the COC+5CB mixtures as promising matrices for
composite materials on the basis of liquid crystals and carbon nanotubes.

with an existing wave/turbulence code that solves equations of mass, momentum,

stream-stream interactions between flux tubes, we used those models as inner
boundary conditions for a time-steady MHD description of radial and

out much of the smallest-scale variability, making it difficult to see how
individual flux tubes on granular or supergranular scales can survive out to 1

of individuals. In the new approaches stable population size is a dynamic
equilibrium between different mortality and fecundity factors instead of an
arbitrary fixed carrying capacity. The latest replicator dynamics models assume
that regulation of the population size acts through feedback driven by density
dependent juvenile mortality. Here, we consider a simplified model to extract
the properties of this approach. We show that at the stable population size,
the structure of the frequency dependent evolutionary game emerges. Turnover of
individuals induces a lottery mechanism where for each nest site released by a
dead adult individual a single newborn is drawn from the pool of newborn
candidates. This frequency dependent selection leads toward the strategy
maximizing the number of newborns per adult death. However, multiple strategies
can maximize this value. Among them, the strategy with the greatest mortality
(which implies greater instantaneous growth rate) is selected. This result is
important for the discussion about universal fitness measures and which
parameters are maximized by natural selection. This is related to the fitness
measures R0 and r, because the number of newborns per single dead individual
equals lifetime production of newborn R0 in models without ageing. Our model
suggests the existence of another fitness measure which is the combination of
R0 and r. According to the nest site lottery mechanism, at stable population
size, selection favours strategies with the greatest r from those with the
greatest R0.

the fractional in-band power; i.e., the fraction of the signal power that lies
within the band of each frequency channel. While this quantity is often
selected arbitrarily, a tradeoff is involved in the choice. This paper presents
a new analysis of frequency-hopping ad hoc networks that carefully incorporates
the effect of ACI. The analysis accounts for the shadowing, Nakagami fading,
CPFSK modulation index, code rate, number of frequency channels, fractional
in-band power, and spatial distribution of the interfering mobiles. Expressions
are presented for both outage probability and transmission capacity. With the
objective of maximizing the transmission capacity, the optimal fractional

correlation of supernova color and redshift. The correlation of magnitude
residuals relative to the $\Lambda CDM$ model and $color \times redshift$ has a
significance equivalent to 13 standard deviations, as evaluated by randomly
shuffling the data. Extending the existing $B-V$ color correction to a relation
linear in redshift improves the goodness of fit $\chi^{2}$ by more than 50
units, an equivalent 7-$\sigma$ significance, while adding only one parameter.
The $color-redshift$ correlation is quite robust, cannot be attributed to
outliers, and passes several tests of consistency. We review previous hints of
redshift dependence in color parameters found in bin-by-bin fits interpreted as
parameter bias. We show that neither the bias nor the change $\Delta \chi^{2}$
of our study can be explained by those effects. The previously known relation
that bluer supernovae have larger absolute luminosity tends to empirically
flatten out with increasing redshift. The best-fit cosmological dark energy

surprising behavior at low temperatures. As their temperature is reduced,
materials of both kinds can abruptly fall into a state in which they will
support a persistent, essentially immortal, flow of particles. Unlike anything
in classical physics, these flows engender neither friction nor resistance. A
major accomplishment of Twentieth Century physics was the development of an
understanding of this very surprising behavior via the construction of
partially microscopic and partially macroscopic quantum theories of superfluid
helium and superconducting metals. Such theories come in two parts: a theory of
the motion of particle-like excitations, called quasiparticles, and of the
persistent flows itself via a huge coherent excitation, called a condensate.
Two people, above all others, were responsible for the construction of the
quasiparticle side of the theories of these very special low-temperature
behaviors: Lev Landau and John Bardeen. Curiously enough they both partially
ignored and partially downplayed the importance of the condensate. In both
cases, this neglect of the actual superfluid or superconducting flow interfered
with their ability to understand the implications of the theory they had
created. They then had difficulty assessing the important advances that
occurred immediately after their own great work.
  Some speculations are offered about the source of this unevenness in the
judgments of these two leading scientists.

the inhomogeneously polarized nuclear spins as an initial state, we further

communication systems: the scheduling policy with heterogeneous users, the
closed form sum rate, and the randomness of multiuser diversity with selective

policy, we guarantee fairness among users as well as obtain multiuser diversity
gain in the heterogeneous scenario. Under this scheduling framework, the
individual sum rate, namely the average rate for a given user multiplied by the
number of users, is of interest and analyzed under different feedback schemes.
Firstly, under the full feedback scheme, we derive the closed form individual
sum rate by employing a decomposition of the probability density function of
the selected user's signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio. This technique is
employed to further obtain a closed form rate approximation with selective
feedback in the spatial dimension. The analysis is also extended to random
beamforming in a wideband OFDMA system with additional selective feedback in
the spectral dimension wherein only the best beams for the best-L resource
blocks are fed back. We utilize extreme value theory to examine the randomness
of multiuser diversity incurred by selective feedback. Finally, by leveraging
the tail equivalence method, the multiplicative effect of selective feedback
and random observations is observed to establish the individual rate scaling.

popularity interacts with censorship. We also used natural language processing

calculations with different bases, which included the NOs obtained by various
traditional electron correlation methods, as well as NOs acquired from
preliminary moderate DMRG calculations (e.g., preserved states less than 500).
The tested systems included N$_2$, transition metal Cr$_2$ systems, as well as

compromise between the requirement for low computational costs of acquiring NOs

be very dependent on the studied systems' diverse electron correlation
characteristics and the size of the active space. It is also shown that a

in a basis of carefully chosen NOs can provide a less expensive alternative to
the standard DMRG-CASSCF calculation and avoid the convergence difficulties of
orbital optimization for large active spaces. The effect of different NO

instead of the easy-plane one, considered before. The weak in-plane anisotropy,
found by means of electron spin resonance spectroscopy and magnetization
measurements, is about an order of magnitude weaker, than the off-plane
anisotropy. The weak in-plane anisotropy results in a spin-flop phase
transition for the magnetic field aligned along easy axis, and, thereby, in a
bicritical point on the phase diagram. A remarkable feature of the weak
in-plane anisotropy is the abrupt change of its sign at the spin-flop point.
This anisotropy switching disappears at the tilting of magnetic field to the
easy axis by the angle of 10$^\circ$ within the plane. The nature of the abrupt
anisotropy reversal remains unclear. The phase diagram is characterized by the
increase of the ordering temperature in the magnetic field used, except for a
dip near the bicritical point.

additional low-intensity pulses which cannot be self-trapped \textit{per se}.

show a very small contrast of 0.35 dex between the light-curve minimum
occurring soon after the breakout, and the main luminosity peak that is due to
radioactive heating of the ejecta. Hydrodynamical models show that the cooling
of a shocked Wolf-Rayet star leads to a much greater difference (> 0.9 dex).
Our proposed scenario is that of a jet produced during the explosion which
deposits 56Ni-rich material in the outer layers of the ejecta. The presence of
high-velocity radioactive material allows us to reproduce the complete
luminosity evolution of the object. Without outer 56Ni it could be possible to
reproduce the early emission purely from cooling of the shocked envelope by
assuming a larger progenitor than a Wolf-Rayet star, but that would require an
initial density structure significantly different from what is predicted by
stellar evolution models. Analytic models of the cooling phase have been
proposed reproduce the early emission of SN 2008D with an extended progenitor.
However, we found that the models are valid only until 1.5 days after the
explosion where only two data of SN 2008D are available. We also discuss the
possibility of the interaction of the ejecta with a binary companion, based on
published analytic expressions. However, the binary separation required to fit
the early emission should be < 3 Rsun which is too small for a system

This dramatically reduces storage and computational bottlenecks, performing
well when the predictors can be projected to a low dimensional linear subspace
with minimal loss of information about the response. As opposed to existing
Bayesian dimensionality reduction approaches, the exact posterior distribution
conditional on the compressed data is available analytically, speeding up
computation by many orders of magnitude while also bypassing robustness issues
due to convergence and mixing problems with MCMC. Model averaging is used to
reduce sensitivity to the random projection matrix, while accommodating
uncertainty in the subspace dimension. Strong theoretical support is provided
for the approach by showing near parametric convergence rates for the

performance relative to competitors is illustrated in simulations and real data

several years operation, the spectral resolution and flux throughput were
deteriorated, realignment is necessary to improve the performance. First, the
wavelength scanning mechanism, the optical components position and the exit
slit guide direction are aligned according to the design value. Second, the
gratings are checked by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). And then the gas
absorption spectrum is measured to optimize the focusing condition of the
monochromator. The spectral resolving power is recovered to the designed value
of 1000@244eV. The flux at the end station for the 200 lines/mm grating is
about 10^10 photons/sec/200mA, which is in accordance with the design. The
photon flux for the 700 lines/mm grating is about 5 X 10^8 photons/sec/200mA,
which is lower than expected. This poor flux throughput may be caused by carbon
contamination on the optical components. The 1200 lines/mm grating has
roughness much higher than expected so the diffraction efficiency is too low to
detect any signal. A new grating would be ordered. After the alignment, the
beamline has significant performance improvements in both the resolving power
and the flux throughput for 200 and 700 lines/mm gratings and is provided to

highly-mobile Pd-carbonyl species, formed via the so-called skyhook effect, are

clusters nucleate; subsequent coarsening occurs through cluster diffusion and
coalescence. While CO increases the mobility in the Pd/Fe3O4 system, surface
hydroxyls have the opposite effect. Pd atoms transported to surface OH groups
are no longer susceptible to the skyhook effect and remain isolated. Following
the evolution from well-dispersed metal adatoms into clusters, atom-by-atom,
allows identification of the key processes that underlie gas-induced mass

(AQE) technique. AQE techniques that select expansion terms from the target
corpus usually do so in one of two ways. Distribution based term selection
compares the distribution of a term in the (pseudo) relevant documents with
that in the whole corpus / random distribution. Two well-known
distribution-based methods are based on Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) and
Bose-Einstein statistics (Bo1). Association based term selection, on the other
hand, uses information about how a candidate term co-occurs with the original
query terms. Local Context Analysis (LCA) and Relevance-based Language Model
(RM3) are examples of association-based methods. Our goal in this study is to
investigate how these two classes of methods may be combined to improve
retrieval effectiveness. We propose the following combination-based approach.
Candidate expansion terms are first obtained using a distribution based method.
This set is then refined based on the strength of the association of terms with
the original query terms. We test our methods on 11 TREC collections. The
proposed combinations generally yield better results than each individual
method, as well as other state-of-the-art AQE approaches. En route to our

symmetry breaking at the phase transition point and the dimension of the model
under consideration. For instance, q-state Potts models in two dimensions
display a second order, continuous transition for q = 2,3,4 and first order for
higher q.
  Tamura et al recently introduced Potts models with ""invisible"" states which
contribute to the entropy but not the internal energy and noted that adding
such invisible states could transmute continuous transitions into first order
transitions. This was observed both in a Bragg-Williams type mean-field
calculation and 2D Monte-Carlo simulations. It was suggested that the invisible
state mechanism for transmuting the order of a transition might play a role
where transition orders inconsistent with the usual scheme had been observed.
  In this paper we note that an alternative mean-field approach employing
3-regular random (""thin"") graphs also displays this change in the order of the
transition as the number of invisible states is varied, although the number of
states required to effect the transmutation, 17 invisible states when there are
2 visible states, is much higher than in the Bragg-Williams case. The
calculation proceeds by using the equivalence of the Potts model with 2 visible
and r invisible states to the Blume-Emery-Griffiths (BEG) model, so a
by-product is the solution of the BEG model on thin random graphs.

with increasing mass of the primary if the primary's mass is less than about
1.3$M_{\rm \odot}$, and above this mass the ratio is roughly constant. By
comparing the theoretical minimum mass ratio with the observational data, it is
found that the existence of low-$q$ systems can be explained by the different
structure of the primaries with different masses. This suggests that the
dimensionless gyration radius ($k_1^2$) and thus the structure of the primary
is very important in determining the minimum mass ratio. In addition, we
investigate the mass loss during the merging process of W UMa systems and
calculate the rotation velocities of the single stars formed by the merger of W
UMa binaries due to tidal instability. It is found that in the case of the
conservation of mass and angular momentum, the merged single stars rotate with
a equatorial velocity of about $588\sim819$ km s$^{-1}$, which is much larger
than their break-up velocities ($v_{\rm b}$). This suggests that the merged
stars should extend to a very large radius (3.7$\sim$5.3 times the radii of the
primaries) or W UMa systems would lose a large amount of mass (21$\sim$33 per
cent of the total mass) during the merging process. If the effect of magnetic
braking is considered, the mass loss decreases to be 12$\sim$18 per cent of
their total masses. This implies that the significant angular momentum and mass
might be lost from W UMa systems in the course of the merging process, and this
kind of mass and angular momentum loss might be driven by the release of
orbital energy of the secondaries, which is similar to common-envelope
evolution.

after one realizes that they are orbital selective. We found that the
superconductivity is enhanced by the Fermi surface nesting, but only when it is
between $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ Fermi surfaces, while for the $d_{xy}$ orbital, even
nearly perfect Fermi surface nesting could not induce superconductivity.
Moreover, the superconductivity is completely suppressed just when the
$d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ hole pockets sink below Fermi energy and evolve into an
electron pocket. Our results thus establish the orbital selective relation
between the Fermiology and the superconductivity in iron-based superconductors,
and substantiate the critical role of the $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ orbitals.
Furthermore, around the zone center, we found that the $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$-based
bands are much less sensitive to impurity scattering than the $d_{xy}$-based
band, which explains the robust superconductivity against heavy doping in
iron-based superconductors.

index (BMI) provide reliable indicators of children's growth. The 2000 CDC
growth charts are the national standards in the United States for these
important measures. But these growth charts were generated using data from
1963-1994. To understand the growth patterns of US children since 1994, we
generate weight-for-age, stature-for-age and BMI-for-age percentile curves for
both boys and girls aged 2-20 through the methods used to generate the 2000 CDC
growth charts. Our datasets are from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) for years 1999-2010 and and from NorthShore
University HealthSystem's Enterprise Data Warehouse (NS-EDW) for years
2006-2012. The weight and BMI percentile curves generated from NS-EDW and
NHANES data differ substantially from the CDC percentile curves, while those
for stature do not differ substantially. We conclude that the population weight
and BMI values of US children in recent years have increased significantly
since 2000 and the 2000 CDC growth charts may no longer be applicable to the
current population of US children. Our charts poignantly reveals the increasing
obesity of American children.

symmetry transformation allows the identification of circularly polarized plane

in a homogeneous, dispersive medium, allowing the derivation of the zilch
density and flux in such a medium. Optical helicity density and flux are also

zilch-helicity relation acquires a factor of the square of the phase index in a

side information on the channel estimate, which he does not know directly. We
derive the attacking strategy that provides the tightest bound on the error
region, given the statistics of the side information. This turns out to be a
zero mean, circularly symmetric Gaussian density whose correlation matrices may
be obtained by solving a constrained optimization problem. We propose an
iterative algorithm for its solution: Starting from the closed form solution of
a relaxed problem, we obtain, by projection, an initial feasible solution;
then, by an iterative procedure, we look for the fixed point solution of the
problem. Numerical results show that for cases of interest the iterative
approach converges, and perturbation analysis shows that the found solution is
a local minimum.

returns a set of monomials that is never larger than the set returned by the

Frequently the problems involve computing the index of a matrix, i.e. the
number of positive and negative eigenvalues, and the dimension of the kernel.
In this paper we consider one of the most common examples, where the matrix
takes the form of a signed graph Laplacian. We show that the there are
topological constraints on the index of the Laplacian matrix related to the
dimension of a certain homology group. In certain situations, when the homology
group is trivial, the index of the operator is rigid and is determined only by
the topology of the network and is independent of the strengths of the
interactions. In general these constraints give upper and lower bounds on the
number of positive and negative eigenvalues, with the dimension of the homology
group counting the number of eigenvalue crossings. The homology group also
gives a natural decomposition of the dynamics into ""fixed"" degrees of freedom,
whose index does not depend on the edge-weights, and an orthogonal set of
""free"" degrees of freedom, whose index changes as the edge weights change. We
also present some numerical studies of this problem for large random matrices.

that x is drawn from a given product distribution, and the goal is to minimize

it is known as ""sequential testing"" of Boolean functions. It has also been
studied in learning theory in the context of learning with attribute costs. We

Stochastic Boolean Function Evaluation. We give a 3-approximation algorithm for
evaluating Boolean linear threshold formulas. We also present an approximation

  1073--1088",,,"math.LO cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A universal schema for diagonalization was popularized by N. S. Yanofsky
(2003) in which the existence of a (diagonolized-out and contradictory) object
implies the existence of a fixed-point for a certain function. It was shown
that many self-referential paradoxes and diagonally proved theorems can fit in
that schema. Here, we fit more theorems in the universal schema of
diagonalization, such as Euclid's theorem on the infinitude of the primes and
new proofs of Boolos (1997) for Cantor's theorem on the non-equinumerosity of a
set with its powerset. Then, in Linear Temporal Logic, we show the
non-existence of a fixed-point in this logic whose proof resembles the argument
of Yablo's paradox. Thus, Yablo's paradox turns for the first time into a
genuine mathematico-logical theorem in the framework of Linear Temporal Logic.
Again the diagonal schema of the paper is used in this proof, and also it is
shown that G. Priest's inclosure schema (1997) can fit in our universal
diagonal/fixed-point schema. We also show the existence of dominating
(Ackermann-like) functions (which dominate a given countable set of
functions---like primitive recursives) using the schema.

the Sun in five narrow pass bands (centered at 215.0, 393.37, 535.7, 607.1, and

June 2010 into a Sun synchronous dawn-dusk orbit. It represents a European
asset aiming at collecting solar observations that can serve to estimate some
of the inputs to Earth climate models. The scientific payload consists of the
SODISM imager and of two radiometers, SOVAP (SOlar VAriability PICARD) and
PREMOS (PREcision MOnitor Sensor), which carry out measurements that allow
estimating the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) and the Solar Spectral Irradiance
(SSI) from the middle ultraviolet to the red. The SODISM telescope monitors
solar activity continuously. It thus produces images that can also feed SSI
reconstruction models. Further, the objectives of SODISM encompass the probing
of the interior of the Sun via helioseismic analysis of observations in
intensity (on the solar disc and at the limb), and via astrometric
investigations at the limb. The latter addresses especially the spectral
dependence of the radial limb shape, and the temporal evolution of the solar
diameter and asphericity. After a brief review of its original science
objectives, this paper presents the detailed design of the SODISM instrument,
its expected performance, and the scheme of its flight operations. Some
observations with SODISM are presented and discussed.

frequency of intra-chain collisions between monomers depends on their spatial

the collision probability depends only weakly on the spatial position of the

recurrent nova T Pyxidis, using the global telescope network of the Center for
Backyard Astrophysics. During 1996-2011, that wave was highly stable in
amplitude and waveform, resembling the orbital wave commonly seen in supersoft
binaries. The period, however, was found to increase on a timescale
P/P-dot=3x10^5 yr. This suggests a mass transfer rate of ~10^-7 M_sol/yr in
quiescence. The orbital signal became vanishingly weak (<0.003 mag) near
maximum light of the 2011 eruption. After it returned to visibility near V=11,
the orbital period had increased by 0.0054(6) %. This is a measure of the mass
ejected in the nova outburst. For a plausible choice of binary parameters, that
mass is at least 3x10^-5 M_sol, and probably more. This represents >300 yr of
accretion at the pre-outburst rate, but the time between outbursts was only 45
yr. Thus the erupting white dwarf seems to have ejected at least 6x more mass
than it accreted. If this eruption is typical, the white dwarf must be eroding,
rather than growing, in mass -- dashing the star's hopes of ever becoming
famous via a supernova explosion. Instead, it seems likely that the binary
dynamics are basically a suicide pact between the eroding white dwarf and the
low-mass secondary, excited and rapidly whittled down, probably by the white
dwarf's EUV radiation.

The measurement covers the transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) range from 100,

The measured $p_{\rm T}$ distributions and yields are compared to expectations
based on hydrodynamic, thermal and recombination models. The spectral shapes of
central collisions show a stronger radial flow than measured at lower energies,
which can be described in hydrodynamic models. In peripheral collisions, the
$p_{\rm T}$ distributions are not well reproduced by hydrodynamic models.
Ratios of integrated particle yields are found to be nearly independent of
centrality. The yield of protons normalized to pions is a factor ~1.5 lower

represents a crucial protocol for future quantum information networks.
Surprisingly, it has been theoretically shown that two distant systems can be
entangled by sending a third mediating system that is not entangled with either
of them. Such a possibility seems to contradict the intuition that to
distribute entanglement, the transmitted system always needs to be entangled
with the sender. Here, we experimentally distribute entanglement by exchanging
a subsystem and successfully prove that this subsystem is not entangled with
either of the two parties. Our implementation relies on the preparation of a
specific three-mode Gaussian state containing thermal noise that demolishes the
entanglement in two of the three bipartite splittings. After transmission of a
separable mode this noise can be removed by quantum interference. Our work
demonstrates an unexpected variant of entanglement distribution and improves
the understanding necessary to engineer multipartite quantum information
networks.

4e^2/h) is produced in semiconductor-superconductor hybrid nanowires due to a
suppressed pair potential and/or an excess Zeeman field at the ends of the
heterostructure, both of which can occur in experiments. The zero bias peak
(ZBP) (a) appears above a threshold parallel bulk Zeeman field, (b) is stable
for a range of bulk field before splitting, (c) disappears with rotation of the
bulk Zeeman field, and, (d) is robust to weak disorder fluctuations. The ZBPs
from the nanowire ends are also expected to produce splitting oscillations with
the applied field similar to those from Majorana fermions. We find that the
only unambiguous way to distinguish these trivial ZBPs (of height 4e^2/h) from
those arising from Majorana fermions (of height 2e^2/h) is by comparing the
(zero temperature) peak height and/or through an interference experiment.

theoretical models to constrain the composition and thermal structure of the
planet's atmosphere. Our measured transmission spectrum exhibits a scatter that
corresponds to 1.3 scale heights of the planet's atmosphere, which is
consistent with the size of spectral features predicted by theoretical models
for a clear atmosphere. We detected the secondary eclipses of the planet at
significances ranging from 2.2 to 14.4 sigma. The secondary eclipse depths, and
the significances of the detections increase towards longer wavelengths. Our
measured emission spectrum is consistent with a 2250 K effectively isothermal
1-D model for the planet's dayside atmosphere. This model also matches
previously published photometric measurements from the Spitzer Space Telescope

possible means, by photon-photon pair production, to constrain the currently

the peak splitting of (4 0 0) reflection observed by X-ray single crystal

neutron single crystal diffraction. The structural transition is accompanied by
a sharp drop in magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity, and
thermopower while cooling. A weak lambda anomaly was also observed around 53K
in the temperature dependence of specific heat and the entropy change across
the transition is estimated to be 1.80J/molMoK. The temperature dependence of
magnetic susceptibility was measured up to 750K and it follows a Curie-Weiss
behavior above room temperature. Analysis of the low-temperature magnetic
susceptibility suggests a spin gap of 110K around 53K. A typical phonon thermal
conductivity was observed in the low temperature tetragonal phase. A glassy
phonon thermal conductivity above 53K suggests a structural instability in a

constituent, gaseous molecular hydrogen, does not emit from the disk mass
reservoir, so the most common measure of the disk mass is dust thermal emission
and lines of gaseous carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide emission generally probes
the disk surface, while the conversion from dust emission to gas mass requires
knowledge of the grain properties and gas-to-dust mass ratio, which likely
differ from their interstellar values. Thus, mass estimates vary by orders of
magnitude, as exemplified by the relatively old (3--10 Myr) star TW Hya, with
estimates ranging from 0.0005 to 0.06 solar masses. Here we report the
detection the fundamental rotational transition of hydrogen deuteride, HD,
toward TW Hya. HD is a good tracer of disk gas because it follows the
distribution of molecular hydrogen and its emission is sensitive to the total

space have shown that nanometer-scale dust, or nanodust, is a significant
contributor to the total mass in interplanetary space. Better measurements of
nanodust will allow us to determine where it comes from and the extent to which
it interacts with the solar wind. When one of these nanodust grains impacts a
spacecraft, it creates an expanding plasma cloud, which perturbs the
photoelectron currents. This leads to a voltage pulse between the spacecraft
body and the antenna. Nanodust has a high charge/mass ratio, and therefore can
be accelerated by the interplanetary magnetic field to speeds up to the speed
of the solar wind: significantly faster than the Keplerian orbital speeds of
heavier dust. The amplitude of the signal induced by a dust grain grows much
more strongly with speed than with mass of the dust particle. As a result,
nanodust can produce a strong signal, despite their low mass. The WAVES
instruments on the twin Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory spacecraft have
observed interplanetary nanodust particles since shortly after their launch in

localization. However, the difficulty of producing an ensemble of statistically
equivalent samples in which the electron wavefunction is temporally coherent
has so-far precluded the experimental demonstration of SPS. Here we demonstrate
SPS in random multichannel systems for the transmittance $T$ of microwave
radiation, which is the analogue of the dimensionless conductance. We show that
for $L\sim4\xi$ a single eigenvalue of the transmission matrix (TM) dominates
transmission and the distribution of the $\ln T$ is Gaussian with a variance
equal to the average of $-\ln T$, as conjectured by SPS. For samples in the
crossover to localization, $L\sim\xi$, we find a one-sided distribution for
$\ln T$. This anomalous distribution is explained in terms of a charge model
for the eigenvalues of the transmission matrix $\tau$ in which the Coulomb
interaction between charges mimics the repulsion between the eigenvalues of
transmission matrix. We show in the localization limit that the joint
distribution of $T$ and the effective number of transmission eigenvalues
determines the probability distributions of intensity and total transmission
for a single incident channel.

metals that are locked up in dust: the metals-to-dust ratio. This ratio bears
not only on the ISM and its evolution, but particularly on the origin of cosmic
dust. We combine extinction and abundance data from GRB afterglows, from QSO
absorbers, as well as from galaxy-lensed QSOs, to determine the metals-to-dust
ratios for lines-of-sight through a wide diversity of galaxies from blue, dwarf
starbursts to massive ellipticals, across a vast range in redshift z=0.1-6.3,
and nearly three orders of magnitude in column density and metal abundance. We
thus determine the metals-to-dust ratio in a unique way, providing direct
determinations of in situ gas and dust columns without recourse to assumptions
with large uncertainties. We find that the metals-to-dust ratios in these
systems are surprisingly close to the value for the local group (10^{21.3} cm-2
A_V mag-1), with a mean value of 10^{21.2} cm-2 A_V mag-1 and a standard
deviation of 0.3 dex. There is no evidence of deviation from this mean ratio as
a function of metallicity, even down to our lowest metallicity of 0.01 Z/Z_sun.
The lack of any obvious dependence of the metals-to-dust ratio on either column
density, galaxy type or age, redshift, or metallicity indicates a close
correspondence between the formation of the metals and the formation of dust.
Any delay between the formation of metals and dust must be shorter than the
typical metal-enrichment times of these galaxies. Formation of the bulk of the
dust in low mass stars is therefore ruled out by these data at any cosmic
epoch. Furthermore, dust destruction must not dominate over formation/growth in
virtually any galaxy environment. The correlation between metals and dust is a
natural consequence of the formation of the bulk of dust in SNe [Abridged].

ranging from -1.8 to -1.2, consistent with the variability originating in
turbulence either behind a shock or within an accretion disk. Each AGN has a

  As a consequence, many existing optimization algorithms for both SVMs and
Lasso can also be applied to the respective other problem instances. Also, the
equivalence allows for many known theoretical insights for SVM and Lasso to be
translated between the two settings. One such implication gives a simple
kernelized version of the Lasso, analogous to the kernels used in the SVM
setting. Another consequence is that the sparsity of a Lasso solution is equal
to the number of support vectors for the corresponding SVM instance, and that
one can use screening rules to prune the set of support vectors. Furthermore,
we can relate sublinear time algorithms for the two problems, and give a new

analysis within the slave-fermion framework of QSL phases and systematically
classify possible QSLs in the presence of these perturbations. The dynamical
spin-structure factor for relevant QSLs is computed and their effects are
studied. Our calculations reveal dispersive features in the spin structure
factor embedded in a generally diffuse background due to the existence of
fractionalized S=1/2 excitations called spinons. For two of the previously
proposed $Z_2$ states, the dispersive features are almost absent, and diffuse
scattering dominates over a large energy window throughout the Brillouin zone.
This resembles the structure factor observed in recent inelastic neutron
scattering experiments on singlet crystals of Herbertsmithite. Furthermore, one
of the $Z_2$ states with the spin structure factor with mostly diffuse
scattering is gapped, and it may be adiabatically connected to the gapped QSL
state observed in recent DMRG calculations for the NN HAF. The above
perturbations are found to enhance the diffuse nature of the spin structure
factor and reduce the momentum dependencies of the spin gap. We also calculate
the electron spin resonance absorption spectra that further characterize the
role of spin-rotation symmetry breaking perturbations, and can shed more light
into the nature of the ground state in Herbertsmithite.

their lensing galaxy. In this paper, we investigate the validity domain of this
assumption. Indeed, that premise disregards microlensing of the accretion disc
in the MIR range, and does not account for recent progress in our knowledge of
the dusty torus. To simulate microlensing, we first built a simplified image of
the quasar composed of an accretion disc, and of a larger ring-like torus. The
mock quasars are then microlensed using an inverse ray-shooting code. We
simulated the wavelength and size dependence of microlensing for different
lensed image types and fraction of compact objects projected in the lens. This
allows us to derive magnification probabilities as a function of wavelength, as
well as to calculate the microlensing-induced deformation of the spectral
energy distribution of the lensed images. We find that microlensing variations
as large as 0.1 mag are very common at 11 microns (observer-frame). The main
signal comes from microlensing of the accretion disc, which may be significant
even when the fraction of flux from the disc is as small as 5 % of the total
flux. We also show that the torus of sources with Lbol <~ 10^45 erg/s is
expected to be noticeably microlensed. Microlensing may thus be used to get
insight into the rest near-infrared inner structure of AGNs. Finally, we
investigate whether microlensing in the mid-infrared can alter the so-called
Rcusp relation that links the fluxes of the lensed images triplet produced when
the source lies close to a cusp macro-caustic. This relation is commonly used
to identify massive (dark-matter) substructures in lensing galaxies. We find
that significant deviations from Rcusp may be expected, which means that
microlensing can explain part of the flux ratio problem.

  Aims. The aim of the present paper is to provide new and more detailed
relations at the kpc scale between the gas surface density and the face-on
optical depth directly calibrated on galaxies, in order to compute the
attenuation not only for semi-analytic models but also observationally as new
and upcoming radio observatories are able to trace gas ever farther in the
Universe.
  Methods. We have selected a sample of 4 nearby resolved galaxies and a sample
of 27 unresolved galaxies from the Herschel Reference Survey and the Very
Nearby Galaxies Survey, for which we have a large set of multi-wavelength data
from the FUV to the FIR including metallicity gradients for resolved galaxies,
along with radio HI and CO observations. For each pixel in resolved galaxies
and for each galaxy in the unresolved sample, we compute the face-on optical
depth from the attenuation determined with the CIGALE SED fitting code and an
assumed geometry. We determine the gas surface density from HI and CO
observations with a metallicity-dependent XCO factor.
  Results. We provide new, simple to use, relations to determine the face-on
optical depth from the gas surface density, taking the metallicity into
account, which proves to be crucial for a proper estimate. The method used to
determine the gas surface density or the face-on optical depth has little
impact on the relations except for galaxies that have an inclination over 50d.
Finally, we provide detailed instructions on how to compute the attenuation
practically from the gas surface density taking into account possible
information on the metallicity.
  Conclusions. Examination of the influence of these new relations on simulated
FUV and IR luminosity functions shows a clear impact compared to older oft-used
relations, which in turn could affect the conclusions drawn from studies based
on large scale cosmological simulations.

J2030.5+4751 (SAO 49725), the latter two objects being similar to gamma Cas.
The star associated with Cyg X-1 does not show evidence for variability with an
amplitude higher than 0.3 magnitude over a hundred years. We found significant
variability of one magnitude with timescales of more than 10 years for SAO
49725, as well as a possible period of 500-600 days and an amplitude of 0.05
magnitude that might be the orbital, or super-orbital period of the system. The
data is insufficient to conclude for HD 161103 but suggests a similar long-term
variability. We thus observe an additional characteristic of gamma Cas-like
objects: their long-term variability. This variability seems to be due to the
slow evolution of a decretion disk around the Be star, but may be triggered by
the presence of a compact object in the system, possibly a white dwarf. This
characteristic could be used to identify further similar objects otherwise
difficult to detect.

dwarfs (CO-WDs), are currently the best cosmological ""standard candles"", but
the triggering mechanism of the explosion is unknown. It was recently shown
that the rate of head-on collisions of typical field CO-WDs in triple systems
may be comparable to the SNe Ia rate. Here we provide evidence supporting a
scenario in which the majority of SNe Ia are the result of such head-on
collisions of CO-WDs. In this case, the nuclear detonation is due to a well
understood shock ignition, devoid of commonly introduced free parameters such
as the deflagration velocity or transition to detonation criteria. By using
two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with a fully resolved ignition
process, we show that zero-impact-parameter collisions of typical CO-WDs with
masses $0.5-1\,M_{\odot}$ result in explosions that synthesize $^{56}$Ni masses
in the range of $\sim0.1-1\,M_{\odot}$, spanning the wide distribution of
yields observed for the majority of SNe Ia. All collision models yield the same
late-time ($>60$ days since explosion) bolometric light curve when normalized
by $^{56}$Ni masses (to better than $30\%$), in agreement with observations.
The calculated widths of the $^{56}$Ni-mass-weighted-line-of-sight velocity
distributions are correlated with the calculated $^{56}$Ni yield, agreeing with
the observed correlation. The strong correlation, shown here for the first
time, between $^{56}$Ni yield and total mass of the colliding CO-WDs
(insensitive to their mass ratio), is suggestive as the source for the
continuous distribution of observed SN Ia features, possibly including the
Philips relation.

the simultaneous multi-wavelength spectra of six Compton-dominant blazars. We
include an accelerating parabolic base transitioning to a slowly decelerating
conical jet with a geometry set by observations of M87 and consistent with
simulations and theory. We investigate several jet models and find that the
optically thick to thin synchrotron break in the radio spectrum requires the
jet to first come into equipartition at large distances along the jet (10^5
Schwarzschild radii), consistent with the observed transition from parabolic to
conical in the jet of M87. We confirm this result analytically and calculate
the expected frequency core-shift relations for the models under consideration.
We find that a parabolic jet transitioning to a ballistic conical jet, which
starts in equipartition and becomes more particle dominated at larger
distances, fits the multiwavelength data of the six blazars well, whilst an
adiabatic equipartition conical section requires very large bulk Lorentz
factors to reproduce the Compton-dominance of the blazars.
  We find that all these blazars require high power, high bulk Lorentz factor
jets observed close to the line of sight as we expect from the blazar sequence
and consistent with the results from Paper II. The inverse-Compton emission in
our fits is due to inverse-Compton scattering of high-redshift CMB photons at
large distances along the jet due to the high bulk Lorentz factors of the jets.
We postulate a new interpretation of the blazar sequence based on the radius of
the transition region of the jet (where the jet is brightest in synchrotron
emission) scaling linearly with black hole mass.

the surrounding circum-galactic medium (CGM): gas located beyond the galaxy's
stellar body and extending out to the virial radius (200 kpc). We obtained
ultraviolet spectroscopic data from the Cosmic Origin Spectrograph (COS)
probing the CGM of 20 low-redshift foreground galaxies using background QSOs.
Our sample consists of starburst and control galaxies. The latter comprises
normal star-forming and passive galaxies with similar stellar masses and impact
parameters as the starbursts. We used optical spectra from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey(SDSS) to estimate the properties of the starbursts, inferring
average ages of 200 Myrs and burst fractions involving ~10% of their stellar
mass. The COS data reveal highly ionized gas traced by CIV in 80%(4/5) of the
starburst and in 17%(2/12) of the control sample. The two control galaxies with
CIV absorbers differed from the four starbursts in showing multiple
low-ionization transitions and strong saturated Lyman-alpha lines. They
therefore appear to be physically different systems. We show that the CIV
absorbers in the starburst CGM represent a significant baryon repository. The
high detection rate of this highly ionized material in the starbursts suggests
that starburst-driven winds can affect the CGM out to radii as large as 200
kpc. This is plausible given the inferred properties of the starbursts and the
known properties of starburst-driven winds. This would represent the first
direct observational evidence of local starbursts impacting the bulk of their
gaseous halos, and as such provides new evidence of the importance of this kind
of feedback in the evolution of galaxies.

find that the lens is composed of two masses with a mass ratio q=1.9 x 10^-3.
Thanks to our detection of higher-order effects on the light curve due to the
Earth's orbital motion and the finite size of source, we are able to measure
the mass and distance to the lens unambiguously. We find that the lens is made
up of a planet of mass 0.53 +- 0.21,M_Jup orbiting an M dwarf host star with a
mass of 0.26 +- 0.11 M_Sun. The planetary system is located at a distance of
2.57 +- 0.61 kpc towards the Galactic Centre. The projected separation of the
planet from its host star is d=1.408 +- 0.019, in units of the Einstein radius,
which corresponds to 2.72 +- 0.75 AU in physical units. We also identified a
competitive model with similar planet and host star masses, but with a smaller
orbital radius of 1.50 +- 0.50 AU. The planet is therefore located beyond the

families for detecting and characterizing such signals. We construct waveforms
that deviate from those in General Relativity through a series of

ability to test General Relativity, in some cases by making it easier to detect
a deviation, and in some cases by making it more difficult. We find that simple
single-phase post-Einsteinian waveforms are sufficient for detecting deviations
from General Relativity, and there is little to be gained from using more
complicated models with multiple phase terms. The results found here will help
guide future attempts to test General Relativity with advanced ground-based

compact astrophysical object. A fraction of these massive particles would lose
their charge by spallation or electron capture in molecular clouds located in
the immediate neighborhood of their source, and propagate rectilinearly without

attention. We propose that the entropy profiles could be used to study
cosmic-ray (CR) acceleration around the clusters. If the CRs are effectively
accelerated at the formation of clusters, the kinetic energy of infalling gas
is consumed by the acceleration and the gas entropy should decrease. As a
result, the entropy profiles become flat at the outskirts. If the acceleration
is not efficient, the entropy should continue to increase outwards. By
comparing model predictions with X-ray observations with Suzaku, which show
flat entropy profiles, we find that the CRs have carried ~<7% of the kinetic
energy of the gas away from the clusters. Moreover, the CR pressure at the
outskirts can be ~<40% of the total pressure. On the other hand, if the entropy
profiles are not flat at the outskirts as indicated by combined Plank and ROSAT
observations, the carried energy and the CR pressure should be much smaller
than the above estimations.

model-independently to cosmological scenarios where the time evolution is
driven by a single scalar field. Besides reproducing the known results for

stellar evolution, as asteroseismology has opened up a window into their
interiors. Such insights are a direct result of the unprecedented data from
space missions Kepler and CoRoT as well as recent theoretical advances.
Eclipsing binaries are also fundamental astrophysical objects, and when coupled
with asteroseismology, binaries would provide two independent methods to obtain
masses and radii and exciting opportunities to develop highly constrained
stellar models. The possibility of discovering pulsating red giants in
eclipsing binary systems is therefore an important goal that could potentially
offer very robust characterization of these systems. Hitherto, only 1 case has
been discovered with Kepler. We cross-correlated the detected red-giant and
eclipsing-binary catalogs from Kepler data to find candidate systems.
Light-curve modeling and mean asteroseismic properties are combined to yield
measurements of periods, masses, radii, temperatures, eclipse timing
variations, core rotation rates, and red-giant evolutionary state. After
elimination of false positives, out of the 70 systems common to the red-giant
and eclipsing-binary catalogs we find 13 new strong candidates that are
pulsating red giants in eclipsing binaries, and 10 more that are pulsating red
giants in hierarchical triple systems. The systems span a range of orbital
eccentricities, periods, and spectral types for the red-giant companion. One
case even suggests a system composed of two red-giants. The discovery of
pulsating red giants in multiple systems provides exciting test beds for
precise astrophysical modeling, and follow-up spectroscopic observations of the
candidate systems are encouraged.

label noise assumes that the two classes are separable, that the label noise is
independent of the true class label, or that the noise proportions for each

sufficient for the true class-conditional distributions to be identifiable.
These conditions are weaker than those analyzed previously, and allow for the
classes to be nonseparable and the noise levels to be asymmetric and unknown.
The conditions essentially state that a majority of the observed labels are
correct and that the true class-conditional distributions are ""mutually

distributions. For any label noise problem, there is a unique pair of true
class-conditional distributions satisfying the proposed conditions, and we
argue that this pair corresponds in a certain sense to maximal denoising of the
observed distributions.

NSC does not appear to rotate within our detection limit of ~6 km/s, rotation
is detected at larger radii, where the isophotes appear to be disky, suggesting
the presence of a nuclear disk. We also observe a distinct central velocity
dispersion drop that is indicative of a dynamically cold rotating sub-system.
Following the results of orbit-based dynamical modelling, co-rotating as well
as counter-rotating stellar orbits are simultaneously needed to reproduce the
observed kinematics. We find evidence for varying stellar populations, with the
NSC and nuclear disk hosting younger and more metal rich stars than the main
body of the galaxy. We argue that gas dissipation and some level of merging
have likely played an important role in the formation of the nucleus of this
intermediate-mass galaxy. This is in contrast to NSCs in low-mass early- type
galaxies, which may have been formed primarily through the infall of star
clusters.

describing a self-similar axisymmetric vortex embedded in an external stream
whose axial velocity varies as a power law in the axial (z) coordinate, with
phi=r/z^n being the radial similarity coordinate and n the core growth rate
parameter. We show that, when certain ostensible differences in the
formulations and radial scalings are properly accounted for, the Long and
Mayer-Powell flows in fact satisfy the same system of coupled ordinary
differential equations, subject to different kinds of outer-boundary
conditions, and with Long's equations a special case corresponding to conical
vortex core growth, n=1 with outer axial velocity field decelerating in a 1/z
fashion, which implies a severe adverse pressure gradient. For pressure
gradients this adverse Mayer and Powell were unable to find any
leading-edge-type vortex flow solutions which satisfy a basic physicality
criterion based on monotonicity of the total-pressure profile of the flow, and
it is shown that Long's solutions also violate this criterion, in an extreme
fashion. Despite their apparent nonphysicality, the fact that Long's solutions
fit into a more general similarity framework means that nonconical analogues of
these flows should exist. The far-field asymptotics of these generalized
solutions are derived and used as the basis for a hybrid spectral-numerical
solution of the generalized similarity equations, which reveal the existence of
solutions for more modestly adverse pressure gradients than those in Long's
case, and which do satisfy the above physicality criterion.

The associated multipole field components are used to study the dominant length
scales and symmetries of the coronal field. Polar field changes are found to be
well correlated with active fields over most of the period studied, except
between 2003-6 when the active fields did not produce significant polar field
changes. Of the axisymmetric multipoles, only the dipole and octupole follow
the poles whereas the higher orders follow the activity cycle. All
non-axisymmetric multipole strengths are well correlated with the activity
cycle. The tilt of the solar dipole is therefore almost entirely due to
active-region fields. The axial dipole and octupole are the largest
contributors to the global field except while the polar fields are reversing.
This influence of the polar fields extends to modulating eruption rates.
According to the Computer Aided CME Tracking (CACTus), Solar Eruptive Event
Detection System (SEEDS), and Nobeyama radioheliograph prominence eruption
catalogs, the rate of solar eruptions is found to be systematically higher for
active years between 2003-2012 than for those between 1997-2002. This behavior
appears to be connected with the weakness of the late-cycle 23 polar fields as
suggested by Luhmann. We see evidence that the process of cycle 24 field

uniform or spatially homogeneous seed magnetic field, it is not clear whether
or not we can draw a similar conclusion for a localized seed magnetic field.
The main uncertainty is the rate of magnetic field diffusion on scales larger
than the outer scale of turbulence. To measure the diffusion rate of magnetic
field on those large scales, we perform a numerical simulation in which the
outer scale of turbulence is much smaller than the size of the system. We
numerically compare diffusion of a localized seed magnetic field and a
localized passive scalar. We find that diffusion of the magnetic field can be
much faster than that of the passive scalar and that turbulence can efficiently
amplify the localized seed magnetic field. Based on the simulation result, we
construct a model for fast diffusion of magnetic field. Our model suggests that
a localized seed magnetic field can fill the whole system in (L_sys/L) times
the large-eddy turnover time and that growth of the magnetic field stops in
max(15, L_sys/L) times the large-eddy turnover time, where L_sys is the size of
the system and $L$ is the driving scale. Our finding implies that, regardless

releasing gravitational energy, persisting as sdO-like stars for several
million years before evolving to the helium red-giant phase. We therefore
predict that a luminous OB-like star should be detectable within $\sim 30$
years after the SN explosion. Thereafter, it will shrink and become an sdO-like
star in the central regions of SN Ia remnants within star-forming regions for
SN Ia progenitors evolved via the helium-star channel in the SDS. These He
PIRSs are predicted to be rapidly rotating ($v_{\rm rot} \gtrsim 50$ km
s$^{-1}$) and to have high spatial velocities ($v_{\rm linear} \gtrsim 500$ km
s$^{-1}$). Furthermore, if supernova remnants have diffused away and are not
recognizable at a later stage, He PIRSs could be an additional source of single
sdO stars and/or hypervelocity stars.

the dipole-dipole interaction in the basis of lowest band Wannier functions
which serve as a set of low-energy states for many-body physics on the lattice.
We demonstrate that the effective interaction between dipoles in an optical
lattice is non-algebraic in the inter-particle separation at short to medium
distance on the lattice scale and has a long-range power-law tail, in contrast
to the pure power-law behavior of the dipole-dipole interaction in free space.
The modifications to the free-space interaction can be sizable; we identify
differences of up to 36% from the free-space interaction at the
nearest-neighbor distance in quasi-1D arrangements. The interaction difference
depends essentially on asymmetry in confinement, due to the d-wave anisotropy
of the dipole-dipole interaction. Our results do not depend on statistics,
applying to both dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates and degenerate Fermi gases.
Using matrix product state simulations, we demonstrate that use of the correct
lattice dipolar interaction leads to significant deviations from many-body
predictions using the free-space interaction. Our results are relevant to up

We propose that the cloud has been impacted by the jet, and that it is in the
foreground of the jet, accounting for its blue-shifted emission on the Southern
side of the nucleus. We consider both shock excitation and photoionization
models for the excitation of the cloud. Shock models do not account for the
[SiVI] and [CaVIII] emission line fluxes. However, X-ray observations indicate
a source of ionizing photons in the core of Centaurus A; photoionization by the
inferred flux incident on the cloud can account for the fluxes in these lines
relative to Brackett-gamma. The power-law slope of the ionizing continuum
matches that inferred from synchrotron models of the X-rays. The logarithm of
the ionization parameter is -1.9, typical of that in Seyfert galaxies and
consistent with the value proposed for dusty ionized plasmas. The model cloud
density depends upon the Lorentz factor of the blazar and the inclination of
our line of sight to the jet axis. For acute inclinations, the inferred density
is consistent with expected cloud densities. However, for moderate inclinations
of the jet to the line of sight, high Lorentz factors imply cloud densities in
excess of $10^5 cm^{-3}$ and very low filling factors, suggesting that models
of the gamma ray emission should incorporate jet Lorentz factors $\lesssim 5$.

novalike cataclysmic variable in the Kepler field. We detected a stable
periodicity of 0.114379(1) d, which we identified as being the binary's orbital
period. The stronger photometric period around 0.12245 d, which had been
detected from the ground-based observation, was found to be variable, and we
identified this period as being the positive superhump period. This superhump
period showed short-term (10-20 d) and strong variations in period most
unexpectedly when the object entered a slightly faint state. The fractional
superhump excess varied as large as ~30%. The variation of the period very well
traced the variation of the brightness of the system. The time-scales of this
variation of the superhump period was too slow to be interpreted as the
variation caused by the change in the disk radius due to the thermal disk
instability. We interpreted that the period variation was caused by the varying
pressure effect on the period of positive superhumps. This finding suggests
that the pressure effect, in at least novalike systems, plays a very important
(up to ~30% in the precession rate) role in producing the period of the
positive superhumps. We also described a possible detection of the negative
superhumps with a varying period of 0.1071-0.1081 d in the Q14 run of the
Kepler data. We also found that the phase of the velocity variation of the
emission lines reported in the earlier study is compatible with the SW Sex-type
classification. Further, we introduced a new two-dimentional period analysis

superior advantage of this method.

relationship between the special shape of the type II dynamic spectrum (e.g.,
bump or break) and simultaneous extreme ultraviolet (EUV)/white light imaging
observations (e.g., CME-shock crossing streamer structures). As a further
extension of these studies, in this paper we examine the CME event dated on
December 31 2007 associated with a multiple type II radio burst. We identify
the presence of two spectral bump features on the observed dynamic spectrum. By
combining observational analyses of the radio spectral observations and the
EUV-white light imaging data, we conclude that the two spectral bumps are
resulted from CME-shock propagating across dense streamers on the southern and
northern sides of the CME, respectively. It is inferred that the corresponding
two type II emissions originate separately from the two CME-shock flanks where
the shock geometries are likely quasi-perpendicular or oblique. Since the
emission lanes are bumped as a whole within a relatively short time, it
suggests that the type IIs with bumps of the study are emitted from spatially

applications, designing applicable and affordable verification and validation
(V&V) structures is an important problem. On the other hand, nowadays human
behavior models are principles to make decision in many simulations and in
order to have valid decisions based on a reliable human decision model, first
the model must pass the validation and verification criteria. Usually human
behavior models are represented as fuzzy rule bases. In all the recent works,
V&V process is applied on a ready given rule-base. In this work, we are first
supposed to construct a fuzzy rule-base and then apply the V&V process on it.
Considering the professor-student interaction as the case-study, in order to
construct the rule base, a questionnaire is designed in a special way to be
transformed to a hierarchical fuzzy rule-base. The constructed fuzzy rule base
is then mapped to a fuzzy Petri net and then within the verification
(generating and searching the reachability graph) and validation (reasoning the
Petri net) process is searched for probable structural and semantic errors.

close to the Sun. The second CME caught up with the first one at a distance of
11-12 Rsun. The CME interaction may be responsible for the elevated SEP flux
and significant changes in the intensity profile of the SEP event. The compound
CME resulted in a double-dip moderate geomagnetic storm (Dst = -73 nT). The two
dips are due to the southward component of the interplanetary magnetic field in

starburst galaxies in the Universe. Both their star-formation rate (SFR) and
gas surface mass density are very high, implying a high supernovae rate and an
efficient energy conversion of energetic protons. A small fraction of these
supernovae is the so-called hypernovae with a typical kinetic energy ~1e52 erg
and a shock velocity >=1e9 cm/s. The strong shocks driven by hypernovae are
able to accelerate cosmic ray protons up to 1e17 eV. These energetic protons
lose a good fraction of their energy through proton-proton collision when
ejected into very dense interstellar medium, and as a result, produce high
energy neutrinos (<=5 PeV). Recent deep infrared surveys provide solid
constraints on the number density of ULIRGs across a wide redshift range
0<z<2.3, allowing us to derive the flux of diffuse neutrinos from hypernovae.
We find that at PeV energies, the diffuse neutrinos contributed by ULIRGs are
comparable with the atmosphere neutrinos with the flux of 2e-9GeV cm^-2/s/sr,
by assuming the injected cosmic ray power law spectrum with an index of -2.

preheating in the CMB map. It is found the forms of the curvature correlation

Therefore, it can suffer from poor scalability and may also get stuck in local

label generation strategy. This leads to a convex relaxation of the original
MIP, which is at least as tight as existing convex Semi-Definite Programming
(SDP) relaxations. Moreover, the WellSVM can be solved via a sequence of SVM
subproblems that are much more scalable than previous convex SDP relaxations.
Experiments on three weakly labeled learning tasks, namely, (i) semi-supervised

improved performance, and WellSVM is also readily applicable on large data

plus an exponential disk model. Our lenticular disk galaxies with bulge
magnitudes M_V < ~ -21.30 mag have central stellar deficits, suggesting that
these bulges may have formed from `dry' merger events involving supermassive
black holes while their surrounding disk was subsequently built up, perhaps via
cold gas accretion scenarios. The central stellar mass deficits M_def are
roughly 0.5 to 2 M_BH (black hole mass), rather than ~ 10 to 20 M_BH as claimed
from some past studies, which is in accord with core-Sersic model mass deficit
measurements in elliptical galaxies. Furthermore, these bulges have Sersic

therefore appear to be descendants of the compact galaxies reported at z ~ 1.5

over-looked these dense, compact and massive bulges in today's early-type disk

pre-initiation complex (PIC) have been recently measured with high resolution
in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by Rhee and Pugh (Nature (2012) 483:295-301). Yet
the rules determining the PIC binding specificity remain poorly understood. In
this study we show that nonconsensus protein-DNA binding significantly
influences PIC binding preferences. We estimate that such nonconsensus binding
contribute statistically at least 2-3 kcal/mol (on average) of additional
attractive free energy per protein, per core promoter region. The predicted
attractive effect is particularly strong at repeated poly(dA:dT) and
poly(dC:dG) tracts. Overall, the computed free energy landscape of nonconsensus
protein-DNA binding shows strong correlation with the measured genome-wide PIC
occupancy. Remarkably, statistical PIC binding preferences to both
TFIID-dominated and SAGA-dominated genes correlate with the nonconsensus free
energy landscape, yet these two groups of genes are distinguishable based on
the average free energy profiles. We suggest that the predicted nonconsensus
binding mechanism provides a genome-wide background for specific promoter
elements, such as transcription factor binding sites, TATA-like elements, and
specific binding of the PIC components to nucleosomes. We also show that
nonconsensus binding influences transcriptional frequency genome-wide.

characterized by the existence of quantum entanglement between cosmological
eras. As a consequence, the Von Neumann entropy related to the entanglement
process, can be compared to the thermodynamical entropy in a homogeneous and
isotropic universe. The corresponding cosmological models are compatible with
the current observational bounds being able to reproduce viable equations of
state without introducing {\it a priori} any cosmological constant. In doing
so, we investigate two cases, corresponding to two suitable cosmic volumes,
$V\propto a^3$ and $V\propto H^{-3}$, and find two models which fairly well
approximate the current cosmic speed up. The existence of dark energy can be
therefore reinterpreted as a quantum signature of entanglement, showing that
the cosmological constant represents a limiting case of a more complicated

distribution of multipath components' gains with a hierarchical representation
of the Bessel K probability density function; a highly efficient, fast
iterative Bayesian inference method is then applied to the proposed model. The
resulting estimator outperforms other state-of-the-art Bayesian and
non-Bayesian estimators, either by yielding lower mean squared estimation error
or by attaining the same accuracy with improved convergence rate, as shown in
our numerical evaluation.

lubrication theory and a Lattice Boltzmann method. Both methods allow to
resolve, in different ways, the viscous singularity at the triple contact

fast enough, the entrainment of one fluid into the other one can occur. The

rimmed clouds (BRCs) by using molecular line transfer calculations based on
radiation-hydrodynamic radiatively-driven-implosion models. We find that for
BRCs the separation in velocity between the line profile peak of an optically
thick and an optically thin line is determined by both the observer viewing
angle and the density of the shell driving into the cloud. In agreement with
observations, we find that most BRC line profiles are symmetric and that
asymmetries can be either red or blue, in contrast to the blue-dominance
expected for a collapsing cloud. Asymmetries in the line profiles arise when an
optically thick line is dominated by the shell and an optically thin line is
dominated by the cloud interior to the shell. The asymmetries are red or blue
depending on whether the shell is moving towards or away from the observer
respectively. Using the known motions of the molecular gas in our models we
rule out the envelope expansion with core collapse mechanism as the cause of
the lack of blue-asymmetry in our simulated observations. We show that the
absence of a strong photon dominated region (PDR) around a BRC may not rule out
the presence of triggered star formation: if the BRC line profile has a strong
blue component then the shell is expected to be driving towards the observer,
suggesting that the cloud is being viewed from behind and the PDR is
obstructed. This could explain why BRCs such as SFO 80, 81 and 86 have a blue
secondary peak and only a weak PDR inferred at 8 microns. Finally we also test
the use of 12CO, 13CO and C18O as diagnostics of cloud mass, temperature and
column density. We find that the inferred conditions are in reasonable
agreement with those from the models.

gluonic action density is found to undergo magnetic catalysis at low
temperatures and inverse magnetic catalysis near and above the transition
temperature, similar to the quark condensate. Moreover, the gluonic action
develops an anisotropy: the chromo-magnetic field parallel to the external
field is enhanced, while the chromo-electric field in this direction is
suppressed. We demonstrate that the same hierarchy is obtained using the
Euler-Heisenberg effective action. Conversely, the topological charge density
correlator does not reveal a significant anisotropy up to magnetic fields eB~1
GeV^2. Furthermore, we show that the pressure remains isotropic even for
nonzero magnetic fields, if it is defined through a compression of the system
at fixed external field. In contrast, if the flux of the field is kept fixed
during the compression -- which is the situation realized in the lattice
simulation -- the pressure develops an anisotropy. We estimate the quark and
gluonic contributions to this anisotropy, and relate them to the magnetization
of the QCD vacuum. After performing electric charge renormalization, we obtain

categorification. A tensor product categorification is an abelian category with
a categorical action of a Kac-Moody algebra g in the sense of Rouquier or
Khovanov-Lauda whose Grothendieck group is isomorphic to a tensor product of
simple modules. However, we require a much stronger structure than a mere
isomorphism of representations; most importantly, each such categorical
representation must have standardly stratified structure compatible with the
categorification functors, and with combinatorics matching those of the tensor
product. With these stronger conditions, we recover a uniqueness theorem
similar in flavor to that of Rouquier for categorifications of simple modules.
Furthermore, we already know of an example of such a categorification: the
representations of algebras T^\lambda previously defined by the second author
using generators and relations. Next, we show that tensor product
categorifications give a categorical realization of tensor product crystals
analogous to that for simple crystals given by cyclotomic quotients of KLR
algebras. Examples of such categories are also readily found in more classical
representation theory; for finite and affine type A, tensor product
categorifications can be realized as quotients of the representation categories
of cyclotomic q-Schur algebras.

fluid confined by two parallel plane walls is studied using a direct numerical
simulation approach. During the relaxation process, the momentum of the
particle is transmitted in the ambient fluid by viscous diffusion and sound
wave propagation, and the fluid flow accompanied by each mechanism has a
different character and affects the particle motion differently. Because of the
bounding walls, viscous diffusion is hampered, and the accompanying shear flow
is gradually diminished. However, the sound wave is repeatedly reflected and
spreads diffusely. As a result, the particle motion is governed by the sound
wave and backtracks differently in a bulk fluid. The time when the backtracking
of the particle occurs changes non-monotonically with respect to the
compressibility factor and is minimized at the characteristic compressibility
factor. This factor depends on the wall spacing, and the dependence is
different at small and large wall spacing regions based on the different
mechanisms causing the backtracking.

within the simulations is studied. In particular, we study their dependence
upon the evolution of the photospheric magnetic field and the strength of the

than sufficient to power small-scale, transient phenomena such as nanoflares
and X-ray bright points, with the bulk of the free energy found to be stored
low down, between 0.5-0.8 Mm. The energy dissipated is presently found to be
too small to account for the heating of the entire quiet Sun corona. However,
the form and location of energy dissipation regions are in qualitative
agreement with what is observed on small scales on the Sun. Future MHD
modelling using the same synthetic magnetograms may lead to a higher energy

particular, two special constant unary constraints are a key to an arity
reduction of arbitrary constraints, sufficient for the desired classification.
In an exact counting model, both constant unary constraints are always assumed
to be available since they can be eliminated efficiently using an arbitrary
nonempty set of constraints. In contrast, we demonstrate in an approximate
counting model, that at least one of them is efficiently approximated and thus
eliminated approximately by a nonempty constraint set. This fact directly leads
to an efficient construction of polynomial-time randomized
approximation-preserving Turing reductions (or AP-reductions) from #CSPs with
designated constraints to any given #CSPs composed of symmetric real-valued
constraints of arbitrary arities even in the presence of arbitrary extra unary

In this case, the discrete spectrum can be identified with the joint spectrum
of an integrable quantum system. The second more complex case we propose is a
small perturbation of a selfadjoint operator with a classical integrability
property. We show that the discrete spectrum (in a small band around the real

algorithm. In the max min case, these are obtained as the solution of a convex
optimization problem. The main performance analysis result of the paper is that
this type of distributed adaptation can be analyzed using stochastic geometry
in the proportional fair case. In this case, we show that, when the nodes form
a homogeneous Poisson point process in the Euclidean plane, the distribution of
the optimal MAP can be obtained from that of a certain shot noise process
w.r.t. the node Poisson point process and that the mean utility can also be
derived from this distribution. We discuss the difficulties to be faced for
analyzing the performance of the other cases (maximum throughput and max-min
fairness). Numerical results illustrate our findings and quantify the gains
brought by spatial adaptation in such networks.

differ by a factor of 4, the comparison between their colour--magnitude

well described, in a first approximation, by the same mean metallicity,

due either to the small number statistics in NGC411, or by the star formation

takes as input what is known about the world, and constructs a number of
possible initial states with representations at different abstraction levels. A
plan is constructed for the initial state with the greatest support, and this

for the remaining possible worlds. Planning takes place in an abstraction
hierarchy where strategic decisions are made before tactical decisions. A
super-plan is then constructed, based on merging the set of plans and the
appropriately timed acquisition of essential knowledge, which is used to decide
between plan alternatives. U-Plan usually produces a super-plan in less time

alternative and mutually inconsistent approaches toward modelling uncertainty

approaches, this paper reexamines expected utility theory-from which Bayesian
probability theory is derived. Expected utility theory requires the decision
maker to assign a utility to each decision conditioned on every possible event
that might occur. But frequently the decision maker cannot foresee all the
events that might occur, i.e., one of the possible events is the occurrence of
an unforeseen event. So once we acknowledge the existence of unforeseen events,
we need to develop some way of assigning utilities to decisions conditioned on
unforeseen events. The commonsensical solution to this problem is to assign
similar utilities to events which are similar. Implementing this commonsensical
solution is equivalent to replacing Bayesian subjective probabilities over the
space of foreseen and unforeseen events by random set theory probabilities over
the space of foreseen events. This leads to an expected utility principle in
which normalized variants of Shafer's commonalities play the role of subjective
probabilities. Hence allowing for unforeseen events in decision analysis causes
Bayesian probability theory to become much more similar to Shaferian theory.

updating, we see that Jeffrey's rule and its variations are not revision rules,
either. Without these distinctions, the limitation of the Bayesian approach is
often ignored or underestimated. Revision, in its general form, cannot be done
in the Bayesian approach, because a probability distribution function alone
does not contain the information needed by the operation.

and the pignistic transformation. The system is an integration of an evidential
system for belief function propagation and a valuation-based system for
Bayesian decision analysis. The two subsystems are connected through the
pignistic transformation. The system takes as inputs the user's ""gut feelings""
about a situation and suggests what, if any, are to be tested and in what
order, and it does so with a user friendly interface.

of cost escalation in transportation infrastructure projects. Based on a sample
of 258 transportation infrastructure projects worth US$90 billion and
representing different project types, geographical regions, and historical
periods, it is found with overwhelming statistical significance that the cost
estimates used to decide whether such projects should be built are highly and
systematically misleading. Underestimation cannot be explained by error and is
best explained by strategic misrepresentation, that is, lying. The policy
implications are clear: legislators, administrators, investors, media
representatives, and members of the public who value honest numbers should not
trust cost estimates and cost-benefit analyses produced by project promoters
and their analysts.

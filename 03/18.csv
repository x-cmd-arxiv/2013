the energy resolution and the background in the energy region where the signal

of alpha events, and we estimated the increase in energy resolution obtained by
the combination of the heat and light signals. For the first time we measured

the same function as $Z$ having treewidth at most $18k+2$ and which has at most
$4|Z|$ gates where $|Z|$ is the number of gates of $Z$. In this sense,
cliquewidth is not more `powerful' than treewidth for the purpose of

because it contrasts the situation with graphs where an upper bound on the
treewidth implies an upper bound on the cliquewidth but not vice versa.
  We demonstrate the usefulness of the new theorem for knowledge compilation.
In particular, we show that a circuit $Z$ of cliquewidth $k$ can be compiled
into a Decomposable Negation Normal Form ({\sc dnnf}) of size
$O(9^{18k}k^2|Z|)$ and the same runtime. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first result on efficient knowledge compilation parameterized by

of a bank account and a risky asset whose dynamics are driven by a Brownian
motion and a multivariate counting process with stochastic intensities. The
interest rate, drift, volatility and intensities fluctuate over time and, in
particular, they depend on the state (regime) of the economy which is modelled
by the multivariate counting process. Hence, we can allow for stressed market
conditions. We assume that the trajectory of the risky asset is continuous
between the transition times for the states of the economy and that the value
of the risky asset jumps at the time of the transition. We find the hedging
strategy which minimizes the instantaneous mean-variance risk of the hedger's
surplus and we set the price so that the instantaneous Sharpe ratio of the
hedger's surplus equals a predefined target. We use Backward Stochastic
Differential Equations. Interestingly, the instantaneous mean-variance hedging
and instantaneous Sharpe ratio pricing can be related to no-good-deal pricing
and robust pricing and hedging under model ambiguity. We discuss key properties
of the optimal price and the optimal hedging strategy. We also use our results
to price and hedge mortality-contingent claims with financial components

stars as young as 10^8 years, providing evidence for relatively recent star
formation activity. The strength of the 4000A break is also systematically
higher in brighter S0 galaxies, again indicating the presence of an old stellar
population. Their mid-IR colours indicate that bright S0 colours are like those
of ellipticals while faint S0 colours are more like spirals. All these
observations are consistent with a scenario in which low-luminosity S0 galaxies
likely formed by the stripping of gas from the discs of late-type spiral
galaxies, which in turn formed their pseudo bulges through secular evolution
processes, possibly involving multiple episodes of star formation. On the other
hand, more luminous S0 galaxies likely formed the bulk of their stars at early
epochs, similar to the star formation in elliptical galaxies, and are

  topic maps","5 pages",,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A major computational burden, while performing document clustering, is the
calculation of similarity measure between a pair of documents. Similarity
measure is a function that assigns a real number between 0 and 1 to a pair of
documents, depending upon the degree of similarity between them. A value of
zero means that the documents are completely dissimilar whereas a value of one
indicates that the documents are practically identical. Traditionally,
vector-based models have been used for computing the document similarity. The
vector-based models represent several features present in documents. These
approaches to similarity measures, in general, cannot account for the semantics
of the document. Documents written in human languages contain contexts and the
words used to describe these contexts are generally semantically related.
Motivated by this fact, many researchers have proposed seman-tic-based
similarity measures by utilizing text annotation through external thesauruses
like WordNet (a lexical database). In this paper, we define a semantic
similarity measure based on documents represented in topic maps. Topic maps are
rapidly becoming an industrial standard for knowledge representation with a
focus for later search and extraction. The documents are transformed into a
topic map based coded knowledge and the similarity between a pair of documents
is represented as a correlation between the common patterns (sub-trees). The
experimental studies on the text mining datasets reveal that this new
similarity measure is more effective as compared to commonly used similarity
measures in text clustering.

  Strong Pulsars","7 pages",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In Aristotelian Electrodynamics (AE), due to radiation over-damping, the
velocity rather than the acceleration of a charge is determined by the local
electromagnetic field. Treating electrons and positrons separately, AE seems to
give a faithful description of the flow of charges in a pulsar magnetosphere.
AE might allow to calculate the pulsar emission in full detail, at all energies
except the radio.
  But AE is not a full theory -- the plasma production processes must be added.
Here we show that the pulsar magnetosphere and the resulting emission are
sensitive to the plasma production rate near the light cylinder. In strong
pulsars (high production rate, due to photon-photon collisions), the number of
field lines closing beyond the light cylinder decreases. This reduces both the
pulsar efficiency (the ratio of the pulsed bolometric luminosity to the
spin-down power) and the characteristic photon energy, in overall agreement
with the Fermi data.
  For weak pulsars (low production rate), our numerical implementation of AE
works stably and seems to be ready to calculate the lightcurves and spectra.
But for strong pulsars, the code (included) needs improvement or better
understanding.

apply forward fitting of the radio spectrum time sequence with the

the contribution from the acceleration region dominates the radio spectrum, the
X-ray- and radio- derived electron energy spectral indices agree well with each
other. During this time the maximum energy of the accelerated electron spectrum
displays a monotonic increase with time from ~ 300 keV to ~ 2 MeV over roughly
one minute duration indicative of an acceleration process in the form of growth
of the power-law tail; the fast electron residence time in the acceleration
region is about 2 - 4 s, which is much longer than the time of flight and so
requires a strong diffusion mode there to inhibit free-streaming propagation.
The acceleration region has a relatively strong magnetic field, B ~ 120 G, and
a low thermal density, less than 2x10^9 cm^-3. These acceleration region
properties are consistent with a stochastic acceleration mechanism.

interval has proved difficult, because of the well known boundary bias issues a
conventional kernel density estimator would necessarily face in this situation.
Transforming the variable of interest into a variable whose density has
unconstrained support, estimating that density, and obtaining an estimate of
the density of the original variable through back-transformation, seems a
natural idea to easily get rid of the boundary problems. In practice, however,
a simple and efficient implementation of this methodology is far from
immediate, and the few attempts found in the literature have been reported not
to perform well. In this paper, the main reasons for this failure are
identified and an easy way to correct them is suggested. It turns out that
combining the transformation idea with local likelihood density estimation
produces viable density estimators, mostly free from boundary issues. Their
asymptotic properties are derived, and a practical cross-validation bandwidth
selection rule is devised. Extensive simulations demonstrate the excellent
performance of these estimators compared to their main competitors for a wide
range of density shapes. In fact, they turn out to be the best choice overall.
Finally, they are used to successfully estimate a density of non-standard shape
supported on $[0,1]$ from a small-size real data sample.

provide an expansion of the black hole tidal field that includes quadrupole and
higher multipole moments and relativistic corrections. We compute the mass loss

orbital energy loss due to gravitational bremsstrahlung and the combined losses
are used to estimate tidal capture orbits. Heating and partial mass stripping
will lead to an expansion of the white dwarf, making it easier for the star to
be tidally disrupted on the next passage. Finally, we examine angular momentum
deposition. By including the octupole tide, we are able for the first time to
calculate deflection of the center of mass of the star and debris. With this

through the magnetic tension of dipped coronal magnetic field. For quiescent
prominences, which exhibit many gravity-driven flows, hydrodynamic forces are
likely to play an important role in the determination of both the large and
small scale magnetic field distributions. In this study, we present the first
steps toward creating three-dimensional magneto-hydrostatic prominence model
where the prominence is formed in the dips of a coronal flux tube. Here 2.5D
equilibria are created by adding mass to an initially force-free magnetic
field, then performing a secondary magnetohydrodynamic relaxation. Two inverse
polarity magnetic field configurations are studied in detail, a simple o-point
configuration with a ratio of the horizontal field (B_x) to the axial field
(B_y) of 1:2 and a more complex model that also has an x-point with a ratio of
1:11. The models show that support against gravity is either by total pressure
or tension, with only tension support resembling observed quiescent
prominences. The o-point of the coronal flux tube was pulled down by the
prominence material, leading to compression of the magnetic field at the base
of the prominence. Therefore tension support comes from the small curvature of
the compressed magnetic field at the bottom and the larger curvature of the
stretched magnetic field at the top of the prominence. It was found that this
method does not guarantee convergence to a prominence-like equilibrium in the
case where an x-point exists below the prominence flux tube. The results imply
that a plasma beta of ~ 0.1 is necessary to support prominences through
magnetic tension.

require at least three elliptical spots. We show that for each source the
spectral changes can be reproduced with a linear combination of only two
different spectra, i.e. the entire surface is covered by two distinct types of

patchy cloud covers consisting of a spatially heterogenous mix of
low-brightness, low-temperature thick clouds and brighter, thin and warm

estimation (DARSE) scheme for power systems via network gossiping. The enabling
technique is the proposed Gossip-based Gauss-Newton (GGN) algorithm, which
allows to harness the computation capability of each area (i.e. a database
server that accrues data from local sensors) to collaboratively solve for an
accurate global state. The DARSE scheme mitigates the influence of bad data by
updating their error variances online and re-weighting their contributions
adaptively for state estimation. Thus, the global state can be estimated and
tracked robustly using near-neighbor communications in each area. Compared to
other distributed state estimation techniques, our communication model is
flexible with respect to reconfigurations and resilient to random failures as
long as the communication network is connected. Furthermore, we prove that the
Jacobian of the power flow equations satisfies the Lipschitz condition that is
essential for the GGN algorithm to converge to the desired solution.
Simulations of the IEEE-118 system show that the DARSE scheme can estimate and
track online the global power system state accurately, and degrades gracefully
when there are random failures and bad data.

adsorption at the LaAlO3 surface of the n-type LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (LAO/STO)

out first-principles electronic structure calculations. In an ambient
atmosphere at room temperature the configuration of 1 monolayer (ML) of water
molecules including 3/4 ML of dissociated water molecules adsorbed at the
surface is found to be most stable, the configuration of 1 ML of dissociated
water molecules is metastable. Water molecule dissociation induces a shift-up
of the valence band maximum (VBM) of the LAO surface, reducing the gap between
the VBM of the LAO surface and the conduction band minimum of the STO. For the
LAO/STO interface with three LAO unit-cell layers, once the coverage of
dissociated water molecules reaches 1/2 ML the gap is closed, the interface
becomes metallic and the carrier density at the LAO/STO interface increases
with increasing the coverage of dissociated water molecules. Our findings
suggest two ways to control the conductivity at the LAO/STO interface: (I)
insulator-metal transition by adsorbing a mount of water at the bare surface;
(II) carrier density change by the transition between the most stable and the
metastable adsorption configurations for 1 ML coverage in an ambient atmosphere

appearing in studies of baryon resonances in lattice QCD. The Hamiltonian model
includes interaction terms in a transparent way, and can be readily generalized
to address multi-channel problems. The eigenvalue equation of the model is
exactly solvable, and can be matched onto chiral effective field theory. The
model is investigated in the case of Delta -> nucleon-pion scattering. A robust
method for determining the resonance parameters from lattice QCD is developed.
It involves constraining the free parameters of the model based on the lattice
spectrum in question. The method is tested in the context of a set of
pseudodata, and a picture of the model-dependence is obtained by examining a
variety of regularization schemes in the model. A comparison is made with the
Luescher method, and it is found that the matrix Hamiltonian method is equally
robust. Both methods are tested in a more realistic scenario, where a
background interaction corresponding to direct nucleon-pion scattering is
incorporated into the pseudodata. The resulting extraction of the resonance
parameters associated with the Delta baryon resonance provides evidence that an
effective field theory style of approach yields a successful realization of
finite-volume effects in the context of baryon resonances.

general limitation of such processing is that rich contextual information is
not taken into account. We propose a block-based method capable of dealing with
noise, illumination variations and dynamic backgrounds, while still obtaining
smooth contours of foreground objects. Specifically, image sequences are
analysed on an overlapping block-by-block basis. A low-dimensional texture
descriptor obtained from each block is passed through an adaptive classifier
cascade, where each stage handles a distinct problem. A probabilistic
foreground mask generation approach then exploits block overlaps to integrate
interim block-level decisions into final pixel-level foreground segmentation.
Unlike many pixel-based methods, ad-hoc post-processing of foreground masks is
not required. Experiments on the difficult Wallflower and I2R datasets show
that the proposed approach obtains on average better results (both
qualitatively and quantitatively) than several prominent methods. We
furthermore propose the use of tracking performance as an unbiased approach for
assessing the practical usefulness of foreground segmentation methods, and show
that the proposed approach leads to considerable improvements in tracking
accuracy on the CAVIAR dataset.

variation in the lattice parameters and transition temperature (Tc) of various

instability. The shape of the vortical solitons may be accurately predicted by
the variational approximation (VA). They exist above a threshold value of the
total energy (norm) and below another critical value, which determines a
stability boundary. The existence threshold vanishes is a part of the parameter
space, depending on the mismatch parameter, which is explained by means of the
comparison with the 2D counterpart of the system. Above the stability boundary,
the vortex features shape oscillations, periodically breaking its axisymmetric
form and restoring it. Collisions between vortices moving in the longitudinal
direction are studied too. The collision is strongly inelastic at relatively
small values of the velocities, breaking the two colliding vortices into three,
with the same vorticity. The results suggest a possibility of the creation of

mass. In the same setting, it is proven that the normalized super
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process converges a.s. to a Gaussian random variable, which
strengthens a theorem of Englander and Winter [Ann. Inst. Henri Poincare

is not too strong and then give a conjecture. This contrasts with the center of
mass of an ordinary super Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with repulsion, which is
shown to diverge a.s. A version of a result of Tribe [Ann. Probab. 20 (1992)

photoluminescence polarization under circularly polarized optical pumping in
transverse magnetic fields (Hanle effect) is studied. A weak additional
magnetic field parallel to the optical axis is used to control the efficiency
of nuclear spin cooling and the sign of nuclear spin temperature. The shape of
the Hanle curve is drastically modified with changing this control field, as
observed earlier in bulk semiconductors and quantum wells. However, the
standard nuclear spin cooling theory, operating with the mean nuclear magnetic
field (Overhauser field), fails to describe the experimental Hanle curves in a
certain range of control fields. This controversy is resolved by taking into
account the nuclear spin fluctuations owed to the finite number of nuclei in
the quantum dot. We propose a model describing cooling of the nuclear spin
system by electron spins experiencing fast vector precession in the random
Overhauser fields of nuclear spin fluctuations. The model allows us to
accurately describe the measured Hanle curves and to determine the parameters
of the electron-nuclear spin system of the studied quantum dots.

whether one should allow or prevent preferential treatment by an internet

question of whether to allow an ISP to have exclusive agreement with a content
provider (CP). In this paper we consider discrimination in the opposite
direction. We study the impact that a CP can have on the benefits of several
competing ISPs by sharing private information concerning the demand for its
content. More precisely, we consider ISPs that compete over access to one
common CP. Each ISP selects the price that it charges its subscribers for
accessing the content. The CP is assumed to have private information about
demand for its content, and in particular, about the inverse demand function
corresponding to the content. The competing ISPs are assumed to have knowledge
on only the statistical distribution of these functions. We derive in this
paper models for studying the impact that the CP can have on the utilities of
the ISPs by favoring one of them by exclusively revealing its private

The knowledge of some subgroups of the automorphism group, under which the code

considering the growing process of the network and neglecting mutations we show
the evolution of highly cooperative systems. Then, we broadly shown that the

published HI results from a simple hydrodynamic model of HD 189733b, a vertical

that non-thermal line broadening or super-solar abundances are required. We
also report evidence of short-time variability in the measured stellar flux, a
variability that we analyze and compare to solar flaring activity. In that

not negligible, which calls for caution when reporting transit absorptions.
Despite these uncertainties, we also show a possible detection for both a
transit and early-ingress absorption in the ion CII 133.5nm lines. If
confirmed, this would be the second exoplanet for which an early-ingress
absorption is reported. Assuming the HD 189733b magnetosphere to be at the

but lies slightly above it in the outskirts. The excess pressure and decrement
in entropy in the outskirts appear to be the result of an excess in the
measured gas density, possible due to gas clumping biasing the density

fraction agrees with the expected hot gas fraction and with the simulations of

modelling the evolution of a community of interacting individuals. We model the
population by a measure space where the measure determines the abundance of
individual preferences. The preferences of an individual are described by a
measurable choice of a rough path. We focus on the case of weakly interacting
systems, where we are able to exhibit the existence and uniqueness of
consistent solutions. In general, solutions are continuum of interacting
threads analogous to the huge number of individual atomic trajectories that
together make up the motion of a fluid. The evolution of the population need
not be governed by any over-arching PDE. Although one can match the standard
nonlinear parabolic PDEs of McKean-Vlasov type with specific examples of
communities in this case. The bulk behaviour of the evolving population
provides a solution to the PDE. An important technical result is continuity of
the behaviour of the system with respect to changes in the measure assigning
weight to individuals. Replacing the deterministic measure with the empirical
distribution of an i.i.d. sample from it leads to many standard models, and
applying the continuity result allows easy proofs for propagation of chaos. The
rigorous underpinning presented here leads to uncomplicated models which have
wide applicability in both the physical and social sciences. We make no
presumption that the macroscopic dynamics are modelled by a PDE. This work
builds on the fine probability literature considering the limit behaviour for
systems where a large no of particles are interacting with independent
preferences; there is also work on continuum models with preferences described
by a semi-martingale measure. We mention some of the key papers.

nonlinear source term and a possible damping term. We proved that if the
initial data enter into the stable set, the solution exists globally and decays
to zero with a more general rate, and if the initial data enter into the
unstable set, the solution with non-positive initial energy as well as positive
initial energy blows up in finite time. These are achieved by using the
potential well theory, the modified convexity method and the perturbed energy

rise to similar observed characteristics. It is argued that the recently
observed broadening of the radio spectra and/or light curves in some of the
type Ib/c supernovae is a direct indication of inhomogeneities. As compared to
a homogeneous source, this increases the deduced velocity of the forward shock
and the observed correlation between total energy and shock velocity could in
part be due to a varying covering factor. The X-ray emission from at least some
type Ib/c supernovae is unlikely to be synchrotron radiation from an electron
distribution accelerated in a non-linear shock. Instead it is shown that the
observed correlation during the first few hundred days between the radio, X-ray
and bolometric luminosities indicates that the X-ray emission is inverse
Compton scattering of the photospheric photons. Inhomogeneities are consistent
with equipartition between electrons and magnetic fields in the optically thin

of this clause set can be used as a skeleton for a proof with atomic cuts only
(atomic cut normal form). This is achieved by replacing clauses from the

  We present a generalization of CERES (called CERESs) to first-order proof

a notion of proof schema based on primitive recursive definitions. A method is
developed to extract schematic characteristic clause sets and schematic

calculus for refutation of schemata of clause sets, which can be applied to
refute the schematic characteristic clause sets. Finally the projection
schemata and resolution schemata are plugged together and a schematic

CERESs is the extension of cut-elimination to inductively defined proofs: we
compare CERESs with standard calculi using induction rules and demonstrate that
CERESs is capable of performing cut-elimination where traditional methods fail.

system: a Rijke tube containing a hot wire. We calculate how the growth rate
and frequency of small oscillations about a base state are affected either by a
generic passive control element in the system (the structural sensitivity
analysis) or by a generic change to its base state (the base-state sensitivity
analysis). We illustrate the structural sensitivity by calculating the effect
of a second hot wire with a small heat release parameter. In a single
calculation, this shows how the second hot wire changes the growth rate and
frequency of the small oscillations, as a function of its position in the tube.
We then examine the components of the structural sensitivity in order to
determine the passive control mechanism that has the strongest influence on the
growth rate. We find that a force applied to the acoustic momentum equation in
the opposite direction to the instantaneous velocity is the most stabilizing
feedback mechanism. We also find that its effect is maximized when it is placed
at the downstream end of the tube. This feedback mechanism could be supplied,
for example, by an adiabatic mesh. We illustrate the base-state sensitivity by
calculating the effects of small variations in the damping factor, the
heat-release time-delay coefficient, the heat-release parameter, and the hot
wire location. The successful application of sensitivity analysis to
thermo-acoustics opens up new possibilities for the passive control of
thermo-acoustic oscillations by providing gradient information that can be

the space density of magnetic cataclysmic variables (mCVs). The survey provides
complete optical identification of all sources with count rate >0.2/s over half
the sky ($|b|>30^\circ$), and detected 6 intermediate polars (IPs) and 24
polars. If we assume that the 30 mCVs included in the RBS are representative of
the intrinsic population, the space density of mCVs is $8^{+4}_{-2} \times
10^{-7}\,{\rmpc^{-3}}$. Considering polars and IPs separately, we find
$\rho_{polar}=5^{+3}_{-2} \times 10^{-7}\,{\rm pc^{-3}}$ and
$\rho_{IP}=3^{+2}_{-1} \times 10^{-7}\,{\rm pc^{-3}}$. Allowing for a 50%
high-state duty cycle for polars (and assuming that these systems are below the
RBS detection limit during their low states) doubles our estimate of
$\rho_{polar}$ and brings the total space density of mCVs to $1.3^{+0.6}_{-0.4}
\times 10^{-6}\,{\rm pc^{-3}}$. We also place upper limits on the sizes of
faint (but persistent) mCV populations that might have escaped detection in the
RBS. Although the large uncertainties in the $\rho$ estimates prevent us from
drawing strong conclusions, we discuss the implications of our results for the
evolutionary relationship between IPs and polars, the fraction of CVs with
strongly magnetic white dwarfs (WDs), and for the contribution of mCVs to
Galactic populations of hard X-ray sources at $L_X \ga 10^{31} {\rm erg/s}$.
Our space density estimates are consistent with the very simple model where
long-period IPs evolve into polars and account for the whole short-period polar
population. We find that the fraction of WDs that are strongly magnetic is not
significantly higher for CV primaries than for isolated WDs. Finally, the space
density of IPs is sufficiently high to explain the bright, hard X-ray source
population in the Galactic Centre.

substantial ""preprocessing"" through quenching mechanisms that can turn
starforming galaxies into passive galaxies without the unique environment of

of a quenching mechanism that produces the majority of passive galaxies. We
suggest instead that starbursts and poststarbursts signal minor mergers and
accretions, in starforming and passive galaxies, respectively, and that the
principal mechanisms for producing passive systems are (1) early major mergers,
for elliptical galaxies, and (2) later, less violent processes -- such as

agreement with recent findings for other open cluster samples, supporting the
increased importance of low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars to the
generation of s-process elements. However, the other s-process elements,
[La/Fe] and [Zr/Fe], do not show similar dependences, in contrast to
theoretical expectations and the limited observational data from other studies.
Conversely, cluster [Eu/Fe] ratios show a slight increase with increasing
cluster age, although with marginal statistical significance. Ratios of
[s/r]-process abundances, [Ba/Eu] and [La/Eu], however, show more clearly the
increasing efficiency of s-process relative to r-process enrichment in open
cluster chemical evolution, with significant increases among younger clusters.
Last, cluster neutron-capture element abundances appear to be independent of
Galactocentric distance. We conclude that a homogeneous analysis of a larger

non-Abelian anyons and quantum magnetism, occuring in ordinary SU(2) quantum
magnets. Here we consider theories of so-called su(2)_k anyons, well-known
deformations of SU(2), in which only the first k+1 angular momenta of SU(2)
occur. In this manuscript, we discuss in particular anyonic generalizations of
ordinary SU(2) spin chains with an emphasis on anyonic spin S=1 chains. We find
that the overall phase diagrams for these anyonic spin-1 chains closely mirror
the phase diagram of the ordinary bilinear-biquadratic spin-1 chain including
anyonic generalizations of the Haldane phase, the AKLT construction, and
supersymmetric quantum critical points. A novel feature of the anyonic spin-1
chains is an additional topological symmetry that protects the gapless phases.
Distinctions further arise in the form of an even/odd effect in the deformation
parameter k when considering su(2)_k anyonic theories with k>4, as well as for
the special case of the su(2)_4 theory for which the spin-1 representation
plays a special role. We also address anyonic generalizations of spin-1/2
chains with a focus on the topological protection provided for their gapless
ground states. Finally, we put our results into context of earlier
generalizations of SU(2) quantum spin chains, in particular so-called (fused)
Temperley-Lieb chains.

gate fidelities for the one-qubit logical gate. Specifically, we show that
despite using a non-fault tolerant procedures in constructing a logical zero
ancilla to implement the T-gate the gate fidelity of the logical gate, after
perfect error correction, has no first order error terms. Meaning, any errors
that may have occurred during implementation are `correctable' and fault

a variational action principle are devised. The formalism is equivalent to the
covariant formulation, encompasses global and local discrete time evolution
moves and naturally incorporates both constant and evolving phase spaces, the
latter of which is necessary for a time varying discretization. The different
roles of constraints in the discrete and the conditions under which they are
first or second class and/or symmetry generators are clarified. The (non-)
preservation of constraints and the symplectic structure is discussed; on
evolving phase spaces the number of constraints at a fixed time step depends on
the initial and final time step of evolution. Moreover, the definition of
observables and a reduced phase space is provided; again, on evolving phase
spaces the notion of an observable as a propagating degree of freedom requires
specification of an initial and final step and crucially depends on this
choice, in contrast to the continuum. However, upon restriction to translation
invariant systems, one regains the usual time step independence of canonical
concepts. This analysis applies, e.g., to discrete mechanics, lattice field
theory, quantum gravity models and numerical analysis.

Hence, it is necessary to provide a mechanism to express variability at

from the theoretical point of view using the two-fluid description. We consider
that the plasma is composed of an ion-electron fluid and a neutral fluid, which
interact by means of particle collisions. To keep our investigation as general
as possible we take the neutral-ion collision frequency and the ionization
degree as free parameters. First, we perform a normal mode analysis. We find
the modification due to neutral-ion collisions of the wave frequencies and
study the temporal and spatial attenuation of the waves. In addition, we
discuss the presence of cut-off values of the wavelength that constrain the
existence of oscillatory standing waves in weakly ionized plasmas. Later, we go
beyond the normal mode approach and solve the initial-value problem in order to
study the time-dependent evolution of the wave perturbations in the two fluids.
An application to Alfv\'en waves in the low solar atmospheric plasma is

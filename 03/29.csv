record a surplus of information above and beyond possible gravitational-wave
events. These auxiliary channels capture information about the state of the
detector and its surroundings which can be used to infer potential terrestrial
noise sources of some gravitational-wave-like events. We present an algorithm
addressing the ordering (or equivalently optimizing) of such information from
auxiliary systems in gravitational-wave detectors to establish veto conditions
in searches for gravitational-wave transients. The procedure was used to
identify vetoes for searches for unmodelled transients by the LIGO and Virgo
collaborations during their science runs from 2005 through 2007. In this work
we present the details of the algorithm; we also use a limited amount of data
from LIGO's past runs in order to examine the method, compare it with other
methods, and identify its potential to characterize the instruments themselves.
We examine the dependence of Receiver Operating Characteristic curves on the
various parameters of the veto method and the implementation on real data. We
find that the method robustly determines important auxiliary channels, ordering
them by the apparent strength of their correlations to the gravitational-wave
channel. This list can substantially reduce the background of noise events in
the gravitational-wave data. In this way it can identify the source of glitches
in the detector as well as assist in establishing confidence in the detection
of gravitaional-wave transients.

adiabatic and antiadiabatic regimes, is studied systematically in the framework
of a minimal model for molecular devices: a resonant level coupled by
displacement to a localized vibrational mode. Conventionally associated with
the limits where the phonon frequency is either sufficiently small or
sufficiently large as compared to the bare electronic hopping rate, we show
that the crossover between the two regimes is governed for strong
electron-phonon interactions primarily by the polaronic shift rather than the
phonon frequency. In particular, the perturbative adiabatic limit is approached
only as the bare hopping rate \Gamma exceeds the polaronic shift, leaving an
extended window of couplings where \Gamma well exceeds the phonon frequency and
yet the physics is basically that of the antiadiabatic regime. We term this
intermediate regime the extended antiadiabatic regime. The effective low-energy
Hamiltonian in the traditional and the extended antiadiabatic regime is shown
to be the (purely fermionic) interacting resonant-level model, with parameters
that we extract from numerical renormalization-group calculations. The extended
antiadiabatic regime is followed in turn by a true crossover region where the
polaron gets progressively undressed. The renormalized tunneling rate, which
serves as the low-energy scale in the problem and thus sets the width of the
tunneling resonance, is found to follow an approximate scaling form on going
from the adiabatic to the antiadiabatic regime. Charging properties are
governed by two distinct mechanisms at the extended antiadiabatic and into the
crossover region, giving rise to distinctive shoulders in the low-temperature
conductance as a function of gate voltage.

Austrian physicist Fritz Hasenohrl examined the properties of blackbody
radiation in a moving cavity. He calculated the work necessary to keep the
cavity moving at a constant velocity as it fills with radiation and concluded
that the radiation energy has associated with it an apparent mass such that E =
3/8 mc^2. Also in 1904, Hasenohrl achieved the same result by computing the
force necessary to accelerate a cavity already filled with radiation. In early
1905, he corrected the latter result to E = 3/4 mc^2. In this paper,
Hasenohrl's papers are examined from a modern, relativistic point of view in an
attempt to understand where he went wrong. The primary mistake in his first
paper was, ironically, that he didn't account for the loss of mass of the
blackbody end caps as they radiate energy into the cavity. However, even taking
this into account one concludes that blackbody radiation has a mass equivalent
of m = 4/3 E/c^2 or m = 5/3 E/c^2 depending on whether one equates the momentum
or kinetic energy of radiation to the momentum or kinetic energy of an
equivalent mass. In his second and third papers that deal with an accelerated
cavity, Hasenohrl concluded that the mass associated with blackbody radiation
is m = 4/3 E/c^2, a result which, within the restricted context of Hasenohrl's
gedanken experiment, is actually consistent with special relativity. Both of
these problems are non-trivial and the surprising results, indeed, turn out to
be relevant to the ""4/3 problem"" in classical models of the electron. An
important lesson of these analyses is that E = mc^2, while extremely useful, is
not a ""law of physics"" in the sense that it ought not be applied
indiscriminately to any extended system and, in particular, to the subsystems
from which they are comprised.

wavelength coverage was 450-850 nm with a resolution of 6 nm. The observed
Earthshine polarization degree spectra exhibit decreasing polarization degree
with increasing wavelength at any phase. The overall degree of polarization
increases as the Earth approaches a quadrature phase. The phase dependence
differs with the wavelengths; the maximum polarization for the V band occurs at
a phase angle of ~90 degrees, whereas that for longer wavelengths is reached at
larger phase angles. This is interpreted as indicating that Earthshine
polarization at shorter wavelengths is dominated by atmospheric Rayleigh
scattering, whereas that at longer wavelengths has an increasingly effective
contribution from the Earth surface reflection. The wavelength dependence of
the phase angle of the maximum polarization appears to be unique among the

one of the three flag manifolds of $G_2$ if and only if it is `nilconformal',

Harmonic maps of finite uniton number are all nilconformal; for such maps, we
show that our lifts can be constructed explicitly from extended solutions.

applied to high frequency market-making with inventory constraints and
directional bets. Our new model admits several state variables (e.g. market
spread, stochastic volatility and intensities of market orders) provided the
full system is Markov. The solution of the corresponding HJB equation is exact
in the case of zero inventory risk. The inventory risk enters into play in two
ways: a path-dependent penalty based on the volatility and a penalty at expiry
based on the market spread. We perform perturbation methods on the inventory
risk parameter and obtain explicitly the solution and its controls up to first
order. We also include transaction costs; we show that the spread of the
market-maker is widened to compensate the transaction costs, but the expected
gain per traded spread remains constant. We perform several numerical
simulations to assess the effect of the parameters on the PNL, showing in
particular how the directional bet and the inventory risk change the shape of
the PNL density. Finally, we extend our results to the case of multi-aset
market-making strategies; we show that the correct notion of inventory risk is
the L2-norm of the (multi-dimensional) inventory with respect to the inventory
penalties.

angles and Dirac as well as Majorana phases in terms of one free parameter.
This parameter, directly related to the size of the reactor mixing angle
theta_{13}, can be naturally of the correct order in our model. Atmospheric
mixing is maximal, while sin^2 theta_{12} is larger than 1/3. All three phases
are predicted: the Dirac phase is maximal, whereas the two Majorana phases are
trivial. The neutrino mass matrix contains only three real parameters at
leading order and neutrino masses effectively only depend on two of them. As a
consequence, they have to be normally ordered and the absolute neutrino mass
scale and the sum of the neutrino masses are predicted. The vacuum of the
flavons can be correctly aligned. We study subleading corrections to the
leading order results and show that they are small.

These theoretical results are confirmed by a simple experimental study of the
nonlinear gain experienced by the twin beams as a function of the phase
mismatch. The model shows that the amount of phase mismatch is key to the
realization of the physical conditions in which the absorption of the twin
beams is minimized while the cross-coupling between the twin beams is
maintained at the level required for the generation of strong quantum
correlations. The optimum is reached when the four-wave mixing process is not

have emerged as a means to facilitate the design, execution, and monitoring of
reusable scientific data processing pipelines. At the same time, the amounts of
data generated in various areas of science outpaced enhancements in
computational power and storage capabilities. This is especially true for the
life sciences, where new technologies increased the sequencing throughput from
kilobytes to terabytes per day. This trend requires current SWfMS to adapt:
Native support for parallel workflow execution must be provided to increase
performance; dynamically scalable ""pay-per-use"" compute infrastructures have to
be integrated to diminish hardware costs; adaptive scheduling of workflows in
distributed compute environments is required to optimize resource utilization.
In this survey we give an overview of parallelization techniques for SWfMS,
both in theory and in their realization in concrete systems. We find that
current systems leave considerable room for improvement and we propose key
advancements to the landscape of SWfMS.

the remaining residual phase leads to a much more tractable sign problem (if at

embedded in a gas disk around a (primary) supermassive black hole, it can open
an empty gap in the disk. A gap-opening secondary close to the primary will
leave an imprint in the broad component of the FeKa emission line, which varies
in a unique and predictable manner. If the gap persists into the innermost
disk, the effect consists of a pair of dips in the broad line which ripple
blue-ward and red-ward from the line centroid energy respectively, as the gap
moves closer to the primary. This ripple effect could be unambiguously
detectable and allow an electromagnetic monitoring of massive black hole
mergers as they occur. As the mass ratio of the secondary to primary black hole
increases to q>0.01, we expect the gap to widen, possibly clearing a central
cavity in the inner disk, which shows up in the broad FeKa line component. If
the secondary stalls at >100r_{g} in its in-migration, due to low co-rotating
gas mass, a detectable ripple effect occurs in the broad line component on the
disk viscous timescale as the inner disk drains and the outer disk is dammed.
If the secondary maintains an accretion disk within a central cavity, due to
dam bursting or leakage, a periodic 'see-saw' oscillation effect is exhibited
in the observed line profile. Here we demonstrate the range of ripple effect
signatures potentially detectable with Astro-H and IXO/Athena, and oscillation
effects potentially detectable with XMM or LOFT for a wide variety of merger
and disk conditions. Observations of the ripple effect and periodic
oscillations can be used to provide an early warning of gravitational radiation
emission from the AGN.

a relationship between the principal components and the effective temperature

observations from different sources. Using as reference the spectra of stars

performing players but rather their emotions. We assume sympathy and envy as
the two emotions that determine the strategy of each player by any given
interaction, and we define them as probabilities to cooperate with players
having a lower and higher payoff, respectively. Starting with a population
where all possible combinations of the two emotions are available, the
evolutionary process leads to a spontaneous fixation to a single emotional
profile that is eventually adopted by all players. However, this emotional
profile depends not only on the payoffs but also on the heterogeneity of the
interaction network. Homogeneous networks, such as lattices and regular random
graphs, lead to fixations that are characterized by high sympathy and high
envy, while heterogeneous networks lead to low or modest sympathy but also low
envy. Our results thus suggest that public emotions and the propensity to
cooperate at large depend, and are in fact determined by the properties of the
interaction network.

the same SFR quenching as satellites within a host halo can explain essentially
all environmental dependence of galaxy quenching. Furthermore, ejected
satellites (continue to) lose significant halo mass, an effect that is
potentially observable via gravitational lensing. The SFRs/colors and

that ignore such history.

boundary conditions are set so that the solutions are consistent with
observations of clusters. We find steady state solutions if the magnetic fields

implying that the SN was undergoing significant interaction with its
circumstellar medium (CSM). These features were blueshifted slightly and showed
a P-Cygni profile, likely indicating that the CSM was directly related to, and
probably previously ejected by, the progenitor system itself. These and other

symbiotic nova progenitor like RS Oph. In this work we extend the spectral
coverage of PTF11kx to 124-680 rest-frame days past maximum brightness. These
spectra of PTF11kx are dominated by H{\alpha} emission (with widths of ~2000
km/s), strong Ca II emission features (~10,000 km/s wide), and a blue
""quasi-continuum"" due to many overlapping narrow lines of Fe II. Emission from
oxygen, He I, and Balmer lines higher than H{\alpha} is weak or completely
absent at all epochs, leading to large observed H{\alpha}/H{\beta} intensity
ratios. The broader (~2000 km/s) H{\alpha} emission appears to increase in
strength with time for ~1 yr, but it subsequently decreases significantly along
with the Ca II emission. Our latest spectrum also indicates the possibility of
newly formed dust in the system as evidenced by a slight decrease in the red
wing of H{\alpha}. During the same epochs, multiple narrow emission features
from the CSM temporally vary in strength. The weakening of the H{\alpha} and Ca
II emission at late times is possible evidence that the SN ejecta have
overtaken the majority of the CSM and agrees with models of other strongly
interacting SNe Ia. The varying narrow emission features, on the other hand,
may indicate that the CSM is clumpy or consists of multiple thin shells.

IMF scaling factors. In addition, Char_mmax is a characteristic maximum stellar
mass in the cluster, but not the actual maximum stellar mass. A <M>-Char_mmax

however, the distribution of observational data in the N (or M)-cmmax plane
includes a dependence on the distribution of the total number of stars, N (and

conclude that a random sampling IMF is not in contradiction to a possible
mmax-M physical law. However, such a law cannot be obtained from IMF algebraic
manipulation or included analytically in the IMF functional form. The possible
physical information that would be obtained from the N (or M)-mmax correlation
is closely linked with the Phi(M) and Phi(N) distributions; hence it depends on

function (IMF), the IMF cannot be arbitrarily normalized to the total mass, M,
or number of stars, N, of the system. Hence, the inference of M and N when
partial information about the studied system is available must be revised.
(i.e., the contribution to the total quantity cannot be obtained by simple
algebraic manipulations of the IMF). We study how to include constraints in the
IMF to make inferences about different quantities characterizing stellar
systems. It is expected that including any particular piece of information
about a system would constrain the range of possible solutions. However,
different pieces of information might be irrelevant depending on the quantity
to be inferred. In this work we want to characterize the relevance of the
priors in the possible inferences. Assuming that the IMF is a probability
distribution function, we derive the sampling distributions of M and N of the
system constrained to different types of information available. We show that
the value of M that would be inferred must be described as a probability
distribution Phi[M; m_a, N_a, Phi(N)] that depends on the completeness limit of
the data, m_a, the number of stars observed down to this limit, N_a, and the
prior hypothesis made on the distribution of the total number of stars in
clusters, Phi(N).

observed with the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer on the Keck I telescope,
we present evidence that the scatter in the well-studied correlation between
the redshift and metallicity of a DLA is largely due to the existence of a
mass-metallicity relationship at each redshift. To describe the fundamental
relations that exist between redshift, metallicity and mass, we use a
fundamental plane description, which is described by the following equation:
[M/H]=(-1.9+-0.5)+(0.74+-0.21)logdv_90-(0.32+-0.06)z. Here, we assert that the
velocity width, dv_90, which is defined as the velocity interval containing 90%
of the integrated optical depth, traces the mass of the underlying dark matter
halo. This description provides two significant improvements over the
individual descriptions of the mass-metallicity correlation and
metallicity-redshift correlation. Firstly, the fundamental equation reduces the
scatter around both relationships by about 20%, providing a more stringent
constraint on numerical simulations modeling DLAs. Secondly, it confirms that
the dark matter halos that host DLAs satisfy a mass-metallicity relationship at
each redshift between redshifts 2 through 5.

much interest for over the past fifteen years. Their low temperature strongly
correlated state can be mapped onto the proton disordered state of common water
ice and, consequently, spin ices display the same low temperature residual
Pauling entropy as water ice. Interestingly, it was found in a previous study
[X. Ke {\it et. al.} Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 99}, 137203 (2007)] that, upon
dilution of the magnetic rare-earth ions (Dy^{3+} and Ho^{3+}) by non-magnetic
Yttrium (Y^{3+}) ions, the residual entropy depends {\it non-monotonically} on
the concentration of Y^{3+} ions. In the present work, we report results from
Monte Carlo simulations of site-diluted microscopic dipolar spin ice models
(DSIM) that account quantitatively for the experimental specific heat
measurements, and thus also for the residual entropy, as a function of
dilution, for both Dy2Ti2O7 and Ho2Ti2O7. The main features of the dilution
physics displayed by the magnetic specific heat data are quantitatively
captured by the diluted DSIM up to, and including, 85% of the magnetic ions
diluted (x=1.7). The previously reported departures in the residual entropy
between Dy2Ti2O7 versus Ho2Ti2O7, as well as with a site-dilution variant of
Pauling's approximation, are thus rationalized through the site-diluted DSIM.
For 90% (x=1.8) and 95% (x=1.9) of the magnetic ions diluted, we find a
significant discrepancy between the experimental and Monte Carlo specific heat
results. We discuss some possible reasons for this disagreement.

describing the condensate by use of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for the order

always leads to the breakdown of superfluidity independently of the value of
its velocity. For weak periodic potentials the superfluidity breakdown may
occur on a very long time scale (quasisuperfluidity) but the breakdown process
can be accelerated by increasing the strength of the OL. Quite remarkably, we
find that when the length of the ring is small enough to imply the discreteness
of the reciprocal space, it becomes possible to avoid the resonant scattering

on a convenient choice of coordinates. This choice of coordinates may be used
to ""simplify"" the functional expressions that appear in the vector field in
order that the essential features of the flow of the ODE near a critical point
become more evident. In the case of the analysis of an ordinary differential
equation in the neighborhood of an equilibrium point, this naturally leads to
the consideration of the possibility to remove the maximum number of terms in
the Taylor expansion of the vector field up to a given order. This idea was
introduced by H. Poincar\'e and the ""simplified"" system is called normal form.
  On another side, even though in many textbook treatments the emphasis is on
the reduction of the number of monomials in the Taylor expansion, one of the
main reasons for the success of normal forms lies in the fact that it allows to
analyze a dynamical system based on a simpler form and a simpler form doesn't
necessarily mean to remove the maximum number of terms in the Taylor series
expansion. This observation, led to introduce the so-called ""inner-product
normal forms"". They are based on properly choosing an inner product that allows
to simplify the computations. This inner-product will characterize the space
overwhich one performs the Taylor series expansion. The elements in this space
are the ones that characterize the normal form. Our goal in this paper is to
generalize such an approach to control systems.

characterize the interaction among them: coupling (how to affect), delay (when
to affect) and topology (whom to affect). For each of them, the existing work
has mainly focused on special cases. With new angles and tools, this paper
makes progress in relaxing some assumptions of these factors. There are three
main results in this paper. First, by using results from algebraic graph
theory, a sufficient condition is obtained which can be used to check
equilibrium stability. This condition works for arbitrary topology. It
generalizes existing results and also leads to a sufficient condition on the
coupling function with which the system is guaranteed to reach synchronization.
Second, it is known that identical oscillators with sin() coupling functions
are guaranteed to synchronize in phase on a complete graph. Using our results,
we demonstrate that for many cases certain structures instead of exact shape of
the coupling function such as symmetry and concavity are the keys for global
synchronization. Finally, the effect of heterogenous delays is investigated. We
develop a new framework by constructing a non-delayed phase model that
approximates the original one in the continuum limit. We further derive how its
stability properties depend on the delay distribution. In particular, we show
that heterogeneity, i.e. wider delay distribution, can help reach in-phase
synchronization.

only its solubility but also the magnetic behavior: the on-site stability of
the spin polarized state grows with reduction of the atomic radius while losing
in the long-rang order interactions. However, for impurities of smaller radius
the weaker inter-site magnetic coupling can be compensated by their
concentration as the impurity solubility limit is shifted to higher magnitudes.

emerge from quantum theory which deals with statistical ensembles, and how
different may end up with different final states. This so-called ""measurement
problem"" is tackled with two guidelines. On the one hand, the dynamics of the
macroscopic apparatus A coupled to the tested system S is described
mathematically within a standard quantum formalism, where ""q-probablities""
remain devoid of interpretation. On the other hand, interpretative principles
are introduced to account for the expected features of ideal measurements. Most
of the five principles, which relate the quantum formalism to physical reality,
are straightforward and refer to macroscopic variables. The process can be
identified with a relaxation of S+A to thermodynamic equilibrium, not only for
a large ensemble $\scriptE$ of runs but even for its sub-ensembles. The
different mechanisms of quantum statistical dynamics that ensure the relaxation
are exhibited. The additional information provided by the sub-ensembles remove
Schr\""odinger's quantum ambiguity of the final density operator for $\scriptE$
which hinders its direct interpretation, and bring out a commutative behaviour
of the pointer observable at the final time. The latter property supports the
introduction of a last principle, needed to switch from the statistical

background are described by a hierarchy of Boltzmann equations. In its integral
form, this Boltzmann hierarchy can be converted from the usual Fourier-space

densities for random flights play a key role in this description. The integral
system can be treated as a perturbative series in the number of steps of the
random flights, and the properties of random flight probabilities impose
constraints on the domains of dependence. We show that, as a result of these
domains, a Fourier-Bessel decomposition can be employed in order to calculate
the random flight probability densities. We also illustrate how the H-theorem
applies to the cosmic microwave background: by using analytical formulae for
the asymptotic limits of these probability densities, we show that, as the

in recent years because of the rich physical properties induced by the

In Sr2IrO4, this interplay opens a gap near the Fermi energy and stabilizes a
Jeff=1/2 spin-orbital entangled insulating state at low temperatures. Whether
this metal-insulating transition (MIT) is Mott-type (electronic-correlation
driven) or Slater-type (magnetic-order driven) has been under intense debate.
We address this issue via spatially resolved imaging and spectroscopic studies
of the Sr2IrO4 surface using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy
(STM/S). The STS results clearly illustrate the opening of the (~150-250 meV)

temperature dependence of the gap width coupled with our DFT+dynamical mean
field theory (DMFT) results strongly support the Slater-type MIT scenario in
Sr2IrO4. The STS data further reveal a pseudogap structure above the Neel
temperature, presumably related to the presence of antiferromagnetic

for astrochemical modelers. The abundances of these molecules cannot be
explained by the previously developed ""warm-up"" scenario, in which organic
molecules are formed via diffusive chemistry on surfaces of interstellar grains
starting at 30 K, and then released to the gas at higher temperatures during
later stages of star formation. In this article, we investigate an alternative
scenario in which complex organic species are formed via a sequence of
gas-phase reactions between precursor species formed on grain surfaces and then
ejected into the gas via efficient reactive desorption, a process in which
non-thermal desorption occurs as a result of conversion of the exothermicity of
chemical reactions into the ejection of products from the surface. The proposed
scenario leads to reasonable if somewhat mixed results at temperatures as low

static Universe, the so called ""emergent universe"" scenario, in the framework
of a theory which uses two volume elements $\sqrt{-{g}}d^{4}x$ and $\Phi
d^{4}x$, where $\Phi $ is a metric independent density, used as an additional
measure of integration. Also curvature, curvature square terms and for scale
invariance a dilaton field $\phi$ are considered in the action. The first order
formalism is applied. The integration of the equations of motion associated
with the new measure gives rise to the spontaneous symmetry breaking (S.S.B) of
scale invariance (S.I.). After S.S.B. of S.I., it is found that a non trivial
potential for the dilaton is generated. In the Einstein frame we also add a
cosmological term that parametrizes the zero point fluctuations. The resulting
effective potential for the dilaton contains two flat regions, for $\phi
\rightarrow \infty$ relevant for the non singular origin of the Universe,
followed by an inflationary phase and $\phi \rightarrow -\infty$, describing
our present Universe. The dynamics of the scalar field becomes non linear and
these non linearities produce a non trivial vacuum structure for the theory and
are responsible for the stability of some of the emergent universe solutions,
which exists for a parameter range of values of the vacuum energy in $\phi
\rightarrow -\infty$, which must be positive but not very big, avoiding the
extreme fine tuning required to keep the vacuum energy density of the present
universe small. The non trivial vacuum structure is crucial to ensure the
smooth transition from the emerging phase, to an inflationary phase and finally
to the slowly accelerated universe now. Zero vacuum energy density for the
present universe defines the threshold for the creation of the universe.

identification of poor photometric redshift areas within the parameter space

target new spectroscopic observations and to improve the overall efficacy of
the redshift estimation. We have tested TPZ on galaxy samples drawn from the
SDSS main galaxy sample and from the DEEP2 survey, obtaining excellent results

general case of consolidation on multiple physical servers so that their
throughput never falls below a desired/predefined utilization level. We use our

achieve minimum throughput degradation on multiple servers. Results are very

quantum features such as entanglement or squeezing. For any practical
application the inevitable impact of decoherence needs to be taken into account
in order to correctly quantify the ultimate attainable gain in precision. We
compare the applicability and the effectiveness of various methods of
calculating the ultimate precision bounds resulting from the presence of
decoherence. This allows us to put a number of seemingly unrelated concepts

bounds that interpolate between the quantum enhanced scaling characteristic for
small number of particles and the asymptotic regime, where quantum enhancement
amounts to a constant factor improvement. Methods are applied to numerous
models including noisy phase and frequency estimation, as well as the

despite recent proliferation of quantitative research evaluation methods. Here
we develop an original framework for measuring how a publication's citation
rate $\Delta c$ depends on the reputation of its central author $i$, in
addition to its net citation count $c$. To estimate the strength of the
reputation effect, we perform a longitudinal analysis on the careers of 450
highly-cited scientists, using the total citations $C_{i}$ of each scientist as
his/her reputation measure. We find a citation crossover $c_{\times}$ which
distinguishes the strength of the reputation effect. For publications with $c <
c_{\times}$, the author's reputation is found to dominate the annual citation
rate. Hence, a new publication may gain a significant early advantage
corresponding to roughly a 66% increase in the citation rate for each tenfold
increase in $C_{i}$. However, the reputation effect becomes negligible for
highly cited publications meaning that for $c\geq c_{\times}$ the citation rate
measures scientific impact more transparently. In addition we have developed a
stochastic reputation model, which is found to reproduce numerous statistical
observations for real careers, thus providing insight into the microscopic

distance shortening in the effective receive constellation at the end of the MA
phase at the relay. The channel fade states that create such distance
shortening called singular fade states, are effectively removed using
appropriate Latin squares. This scheme as well as all other known schemes
studied so far use conventional regular PSK or QAM signal sets for the end
users which lead to the relay using different sized constellations for the BC
phase depending upon the fade state. In this work, we propose a 4-point signal

gives better SER performance (gain of 1 dB) than 8-PSK while still using 8-ary

peer-to- peer routing instead of static network infrastructure to provide
network connectivity. MANETs have applications in rapidly deployed and dynamic
military and civilian systems. The network topology in a MANET usually changes
with time. Therefore, there are new challenges for routing protocols in MANETs
since traditional routing protocols may not be suitable for MANETs. In recent
years, a variety of new routing protocols targeted specifically at this
environment have been developed, but little performance information on each
protocol and no realistic performance comparison between them is available.
This paper presents the results of a detailed packet-level simulation comparing
three multi-hop wireless ad hoc network routing protocols that cover a range of
design choices: DSR, NFPQR, and clustered NFPQR. By applying queuing
methodology to the introduced routing protocol the reliability and throughput
of the network is increased.

superconductors is found to contribute significantly to the magnetic response
of the system. With the use of a realistic five-band model and group
theoretical analysis, we have determined the orbital magnetic susceptibility in
such a multi-orbital system. At $n=6.1$, the in-plane orbital magnetic
susceptibility is predicted to be about 10$\mu_{\mathrm{B}}^{2}/\mathrm{eV}$,
which is more than 2/3 of the observed total susceptibility around 200 K in 122

$4.5\times10^{-4}\mathrm{erg}/\mathrm{G}^{2}\mathrm{mol}_{\mathrm{AS}}$\cite{Klingeler}).
We find the in-plane orbital magnetic response is sensitive to the breaking of
the tetragonal symmetry in the orbital space. In particular, when the observed
band splitting(between the $3d_{xz}$ and the $3d_{yz}$-dominated band) is used
to estimate the strength of the symmetry breaking perturbation\cite{Shen}, a
4.5% modulation in the in-plane orbital magnetic susceptibility can be
produced, making the latter a useful probe of the orbital ordering in such a

anisotropy between the in-plane and the out-of-plane magnetic response observed
universally in susceptibility and NMR measurements.

polarization profiles of solar spectral lines. The Ba II D2 line at 4554 A is a
prominent example, where the F-state interference effects due to the odd
isotopes produce polarization profiles, which are very different from those of
the even isotopes that have no F-state interference. It is therefore necessary
to account for the contributions from the different isotopes to understand the
observed linear polarization profiles of this line. Here we do radiative
transfer modeling with partial frequency redistribution (PRD) of such
observations while accounting for the interference effects and isotope
composition. The Ba II D2 polarization profile is found to be strongly governed
by the PRD mechanism. We show how a full PRD treatment succeeds in reproducing
the observations, while complete frequency redistribution (CRD) alone fails to
produce polarization profiles that have any resemblance with the observed ones.
However, we also find that the line center polarization is sensitive to the
temperature structure of the model atmosphere. To obtain a good fit to the line
center peak of the observed Stokes Q/I profile, a small modification of the
FALX model atmosphere is needed, by lowering the temperature in the
line-forming layers. Because of the pronounced temperature sensitivity of the
Ba II D2 line it may not be a suitable tool for Hanle magnetic-field
diagnostics of the solar chromosphere, because there is currently no
straightforward way to separate the temperature and magnetic-field effects from
each other.

leads to thermally activated transport, we show how disorder leads to a
smaller-than-expected activation energy that gives way to VRH at low
temperatures. We confirm this enhanced conductivity with numerical simulations
that also allow us to explore different degrees of impurity compensation. For
the surface, where the TI has gapless Dirac modes, we present a theory of
disorder and screening of deep impurities, and we calculate the corresponding
zero-temperature conductivity. We also comment on the growth of the disorder
potential as one moves from the surface of the TI into the bulk. Finally, we

Response of nano- and poly-crystals to irradiation depends on the radiation

studied and interpreted individually, and thus severely lacking is the ability
to predict radiation performance of materials in extreme environments. Here we
propose an operational window for radiation-resistant materials, which is based
on a perspective of interactions among irradiation-induced interstitials,
vacancies, and grain boundaries. Using atomic simulations, we find that healing
grain boundaries needs much longer time than healing grain interiors. Not been
noticed before, this finding suggests priority should be thereafter given to
recovery of the grain boundary itself. This large disparity in healing time is
reflected in the spectra of defects-recombination energy barriers by the
presence of one high-barrier peak in addition to the peak of low barriers. The
insight gained from the study instigates new avenues for examining the role of
grain boundaries in healing the material. In particular, we sketch out the
radiation-endurance window in the parameter space of temperature, dose-rate and
grain size. The window helps evaluate material performance and develop
resistant materials against radiation damage.

This article considers the scenario where the likelihood function cannot be
evaluated point-wise; in such cases, one cannot perform exact statistical
inference, including parameter estimation, which often requires advanced
computational algorithms, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We introduce
a new approximation based upon approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). Under
some conditions, we show that as $n\rightarrow\infty$, with $n$ the length of
the time series, the ABC posterior has, almost surely, a maximum \emph{a
posteriori} (MAP) estimator of the parameters which is different from the true
parameter. However, a noisy ABC MAP, which perturbs the original data,
asymptotically converges to the true parameter, almost surely. In order to draw
statistical inference, for the ABC approximation adopted, standard MCMC
algorithms can have acceptance probabilities that fall at an exponential rate
in $n$ and slightly more advanced algorithms can mix poorly. We develop a new
and improved MCMC kernel, which is based upon an exact approximation of a
marginal algorithm, whose cost per-iteration is random but the expected cost,
for good performance, is shown to be $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ per-iteration.

and differentiate, while the latter fixed-point type only proliferates. This
differentiation is analyzed as a saddle-node bifurcation on an invariant
circle, while the number ratio of each cell type is shown to be robust against
perturbations due to self-consistent determination of the effective bifurcation
parameter as a result of the cell--cell interaction. Complex cell
differentiation is designed by combing these simple two-gene networks. The
generality of the present differentiation mechanism, as well as its biological
relevance, is discussed.

signature of dark matter. It is intriguing that the IceCube experiment has
recently reported two PeV neutrino events with energies that may be equal up to

these events to be the first indication of a monochromatic line signal from
dark matter. While measurable annihilation signatures would seem to be
impossible at such energies, we discuss the dark matter quantum numbers,
effective operators, and lifetimes which could lead to an appropriate signal
from dark matter decays. We will show that the set of possible decay operators
is rather constrained, and will focus on several viable candidates which could
explain the IceCube events; R-parity violating gravitinos, hidden sector gauge
bosons, and singlet fermions in an extra dimension. In essentially all cases we
find that a PeV neutrino line signal from dark matter would be accompanied by a
potentially observable continuum spectrum of neutrinos rising towards lower

observation with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) of eight nearby giant
molecular clouds (GMCs) belonging to the Gould Belt. The $\gamma$-ray signals
obtained with high statistical significance allow the determination of
$\gamma$-ray spectra above 300~MeV with adequate precision for extraction of
the energy distributions of CRs in these clouds. Remarkably, both the derived
spectral indices and the absolute fluxes of CR protons in the energy interval
$10 - 100~ \rm \ GeV$ agree with the recent direct measurements of local CRs by
the PAMELA experiment. This is strong evidence of a quite homogeneous
distribution of CRs, at least within several hundred parsecs of the Local
Galaxy. Combined with the well established energy-dependent time of escape of
CRs from the Galaxy, $\tau(E) \propto E^{-\delta}$ with $\delta \approx
0.5-0.6$, the measured spectrum implies a CR spectral index of the
(acceleration) source of $\approx$E$^{-2.3}$. At low energies, the spectra of
$\gamma$ rays appear to vary from one cloud to another. This implies spatial
variations of the energy spectra of CRs below 10~GeV, which at such low
energies could be explained naturally by both the impact of the propagation
effects and the contribution of CR locally accelerated inside the clouds.

guarantees determinism of functional specifications. Essentially, orthogonality
avoids, on the one side, the inherent ambiguity of non determinism, prohibiting
the existence of different rules that specify the same function and that may
apply simultaneously (non-ambiguity), and, on the other side, it eliminates the
possibility of occurrence of repetitions of variables in the left-hand side of
these rules (left linearity). In the theory of term rewriting systems (TRSs)
determinism is captured by the well-known property of confluence, that
basically states that whenever different computations or simplifications from a
term are possible, the computed answers should coincide. Although the proofs
are technically elaborated, confluence is well-known to be a consequence of
orthogonality. Thus, orthogonality is an important mathematical discipline
intrinsic to the specification of recursive functions that is naturally applied
in functional programming and specification. Starting from a formalization of
the theory of TRSs in the proof assistant PVS, this work describes how
confluence of orthogonal TRSs has been formalized, based on axiomatizations of
properties of rules, positions and substitutions involved in parallel steps of
reduction, in this proof assistant. Proofs for some similar but restricted
properties such as the property of confluence of non-ambiguous and (left and

superconductivity occurs when electrons form coherent Cooper pairs below the

superconducting condensation energy. For iron pnictide superconductors derived
from electron or hole doping of their antiferromagnetic (AF) parent compounds,

scattering to show that high-Tc superconductivity only occurs for iron
pnictides with low-energy itinerant electron-spin excitation coupling and high

diblock copolymers is investigated in terms of a mean-field model. The
formation of lamellar structures and their stable states are explored and it is
shown that lamellae are stable not only for the period of the structure
corresponding to the minimum of the free energy. The range of wavelengths of
stable lamellae is determined by a functional approach, introduced with this
work, which is in agreement with the results of a linear stability analysis.
The effects of the interaction of block copolymers with confining plane
boundaries on the lamellae orientation are studied by an extensive analysis of
the free energy. By changing the surface property at one boundary, a transition
from a preferentially perpendicular to a parallel lamellar orientation with
respect to the boundaries is found, which is rather independent of the distance
between the boundaries. Computer simulations reveal, that the time scale of the
lamellar orientational order dynamics, which is quantitatively characterized in
terms of an orientational order parameter and the structure factor, depends
significantly on the properties of the confining boundaries as well as on the
quench depth.

The 2.7 s companion object PSR J0737-3039B is not detected in gamma rays. PSR
J0737-3039A is a faint gamma-ray emitter, so that its spectral properties are
only weakly constrained; however, its measured efficiency is typical of other
MSPs. The two peaks of the gamma-ray light curve are separated by roughly half
a rotation and are well offset from the radio and X-ray emission, suggesting
that the GeV radiation originates in a distinct part of the magnetosphere from
the other types of emission. From the modeling of the radio and the gamma-ray
emission profiles and the analysis of radio polarization data, we constrain the
magnetic inclination $\alpha$ and the viewing angle $\zeta$ to be close to
90$^\circ$, which is consistent with independent studies of the radio emission
from PSR J0737-3039A. A small misalignment angle between the pulsar's spin axis
and the system's orbital axis is therefore favored, supporting the hypothesis

or extracted later to show authentication about the data. Watermark is hidden
information in the image(s) and is so designed that it does not degrade/distort
the quality of the image and still keeps the information. Digital watermarking
is basically to protect ownership rights and to control of making illicit
copies of digital data. In this paper, we have discussed various watermarking
techniques and properties and have proposed a modified LSB technique. We have
implemented the proposed technique by following: 2-bits of 8-bit gray image is
replaced by luminance part, next 2-bits by red component, next 2-bits by green
component and next 2-bits by blue component of 32-bit image using secret key.
The advantage is that watermarking capacity has been increased and unaffected
by various attacks e.g. zero out LSB bits, cropping etc. Watermark image is
imperceptible in resultant image. We have tested this technique on several
images and found that it is quite satisfactory. This technique is secured as
unauthorized user can not extract the watermarked contents easily from the
original image and works well in adverse situations. We have implemented this
technique on platform java 1.5.0.

of $v_1$ observed for positive and negative pions. Such a splitting is visible
in the data reported by the STAR Collaboration from the RHIC Beam Energy Scan.
  Both effects are sensitive to the space-time scenario assumed for pion

of this framework is that the carriers in graphene are considered with their
three dimensional wave function which is then gradually constrained to the
graphene surface. In the process, a geometrically induced gauge field emerges
in the two dimensional equation for the surface dynamics. The computation of
the magnetic field associated with this gauge potential reproduces the measured

the problems of traditional reputation systems which are relatively static in

analyzing (anatomical) trees endowed with vector valued measurements made along
the tree. While state-of-the-art graph and tree kernels use combinatorial
tree/graph structure with discrete node and edge labels, the kernels presented
in this paper can include geometric information such as branch shape, branch
radius or other vector valued properties. In addition to being flexible in
their ability to model different types of attributes, the presented kernels are
computationally efficient and some of them can easily be computed for large
datasets (N of the order 10.000) of trees with 30-600 branches. Combining the
kernels with standard machine learning tools enables us to analyze the relation
between disease and anatomical tree structure and geometry. Experimental
results: The kernels are used to compare airway trees segmented from low-dose
CT, endowed with branch shape descriptors and airway wall area percentage
measurements made along the tree. Using kernelized hypothesis testing we show
that the geometric airway trees are significantly differently distributed in
patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) than in healthy
individuals. The geometric tree kernels also give a significant increase in the
classification accuracy of COPD from geometric tree structure endowed with
airway wall thickness measurements in comparison with state-of-the-art methods,
giving further insight into the relationship between airway wall thickness and
COPD. Software: Software for computing kernels and statistical tests is

Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS) 24$\mu m$ detected Lyman break galaxies

models. The star formation rate(SFR)-age-metallicity degeneracies of SED
modelling are broken by using SFH and chemical enrichment history suggested by
chemical models, which also provide dust mass, dust abundance and chemical
elements locked in dust component. We derive the total mass $M_{tot}$, stellar

stacked MIPS-LBG in a self-consistent way. Our estimate of $M_{\ast}= 8\times

that MIPS-LBGs at $z\sim3$ are young (0.3-0.6 Gyr), massive ($M_{tot} \sim
10^{11} M_{\odot}$), dusty ($M_{d} \sim 10^{8} M_{\odot}$), metal rich ($Z \sim
Z_{\odot} $) progenitors of elliptical galaxies suffering a strong burst of
star formation (SFR $\sim 200 M_{\odot}/yr$). Our estimate of $M_{d}=7 \times
10^{7} M_{\odot}$ of the stacked MIPS-LBG is about a factor of eight lower than
the estimated value based on single temperature grey-body fitting, suggesting
that self-consistent SED models are needed to estimate dust mass. By comparing
with the Milky Way molecular cloud and dust properties, we suggest that denser
and dustier environments and flatter dust size distribution are likely in high
redshift massive star forming galaxies. These dust properties, as well as the
different types of SFHs, can cause different SED shapes between high redshift
star-forming ellipticals and local star-burst templates. This discrepancy of
SED shapes could in turn explain the non detection at submillimeter
wavelengths, of IR luminous ($L_{IR} \succeq 10^{12} L_{\odot} $) MIPS-LBGs.

for many applications. Homogeneity arises when one expects regression
coefficients corresponding to neighboring geographical regions or a similar
cluster of covariates to be approximately the same. Sparsity corresponds to a
special case of homogeneity with a known atom zero. In this article, we propose
a new method called clustering algorithm in regression via data-driven
segmentation (CARDS) to explore homogeneity. New mathematics are provided on
the gain that can be achieved by exploring homogeneity. Statistical properties
of two versions of CARDS are analyzed. In particular, the asymptotic normality
of our proposed CARDS estimator is established, which reveals better estimation
accuracy for homogeneous parameters than that without homogeneity exploration.
When our methods are combined with sparsity exploration, further efficiency can
be achieved beyond the exploration of sparsity alone. This provides additional
insights into the power of exploring low-dimensional strucuture in
high-dimensional regression: homogeneity and sparsity. The newly developed
method is further illustrated by simulation studies and applications to real

total energy flux emitted in gravitational waves by compact binary systems.
Such contributions correspond to the post-Newtonian order 3.5PN for maximally
spinning compact objects. Continuing our recent work on the
next-to-next-to-leading spin-orbit terms at 3.5PN order in the equations of
motion, we obtain the spin-orbit terms in the multipole moments of the compact
binary system up to the same order within the multipolar post-Newtonian wave
generation formalism. Our calculation of the multipole moments is valid for
general orbits and in an arbitrary frame; the moments are then reduced to the
center-of-mass frame and the resulting energy flux is specialized to
quasi-circular orbits. The test-mass limit of our final result for the flux
agrees with the already known Kerr black hole perturbation limit. Furthermore
the various multipole moments of the compact binary reduce in the one-body case
to those of a single boosted Kerr black hole. We briefly discuss the
implications of our result for the gravitational-wave flux in terms of the
binary's phase evolution, and address its importance for the future detection
and parameter estimation of signals in gravitational wave detectors.

measures, both in Euclidean space and in more general setting such as curves on
Riemannian surfaces or curves in the plane minus a set of obstacles. However,
so far, efficiently computable similarity measures for curves on general
surfaces remain elusive. This paper aims at developing a natural curve
similarity measure that can be easily extended and computed for curves on
general orientable 2-manifolds. Specifically, we measure similarity between
homotopic curves based on how hard it is to deform one curve into the other one
continuously, and define this ""hardness"" as the minimum possible surface area
swept by a homotopy between the curves. We consider cases where curves are
embedded in the plane or on a triangulated orientable surface with genus $g$,
and we present efficient algorithms (which are either quadratic or near linear
time, depending on the setting) for both cases.

attracted enormous amount of attention in recent years, above all, due to work
of \cite{CRT,CanRomTao06,DonohoPol}. In \cite{CRT,CanRomTao06,DonohoPol} it was
rigorously shown for the first time that in a statistical and large dimensional
context a linear sparsity can be recovered from an under-determined system via
a simple polynomial $\ell_1$-optimization algorithm. \cite{CanRomTao06} went
even further and established that in \emph{noisy} systems for any linear level
of under-determinedness there is again a linear sparsity that can be
\emph{approximately} recovered through an SOCP (second order cone programming)
noisy equivalent to $\ell_1$. Moreover, the approximate solution is (in an
$\ell_2$-norm sense) guaranteed to be no further from the sparse unknown vector
than a constant times the noise. In this paper we will also consider solving
\emph{noisy} linear systems and present an alternative statistical framework
that can be used for their analysis. To demonstrate how the framework works we
will show how one can use it to precisely characterize the approximation error
of a wide class of SOCP algorithms. We will also show that our theoretical

HARPS-N@TNG aimed to characterise the global architectural properties of
exoplanetary systems. In this first paper we fully characterise the transiting
system Qatar-1. We exploit HARPS-N high-precision radial velocity measurements
obtained during a transit to measure the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect in the
Qatar-1 system, and out-of-transit measurements to redetermine the
spectroscopic orbit. New photometric transit light-curves are analysed and a
spectroscopic characterisation of the host star atmospheric parameters is
performed based on various methods (line equivalent width ratios, spectral
synthesis, spectral energy distribution). We achieved a significant improvement
in the accuracy of the orbital parameters and derived the spin-orbit alignment
of the system; this information, combined with the spectroscopic determination
of the host star properties, allows us to derive the fundamental physical
parameters for star and planet (masses and radii). The orbital solution for the
Qatar-1 system is consistent with a circular orbit and the system presents a
sky-projected obliquity of lambda = -8.4+-7.1 deg. The planet, with a mass of
1.33+-0.05 M_J, is found to be significantly more massive than previously
reported. The host star is confirmed to be metal-rich ([Fe/H]= 0.20+-0.10) and
slowly rotating (vsinI = 1.7+-0.3 km/s), though moderately active, as indicated
by strong chromospheric emission in the Ca II H&K line cores (logR'_HK about
-4.60). The system is well aligned and fits well within the general lambda vs
Teff trend. We definitely rule out any significant orbital eccentricity. The
evolutionary status of the system is inferred based on gyrochronology, and the
present orbital configuration and timescale for orbital decay are discussed in
terms of star-planet tidal interactions.

associated with general relativity. There are two aspects of the problem: The
first is to define a sequence of stopping times associated with the Brownian
""kicks"" or impulses. The second is to define the dynamics of the particle along
geodesics in between the Brownian kicks. When these two aspects are taken
together, we can associate various distributions with the motion. We will find
that the statistics of space-time events will obey a temperature dependent four
dimensional Gaussian distribution defined over the quaternions which locally
can be identified with Minkowski space. Analogously, the statistics of the
4-velocities will obey a kind of Maxwell-Juttner distribution. In contrast to
previous work, our processes are characterized by two independent proper time
variables defined with respect to the laboratory frame: a discrete one
corresponding to the stopping times when the impulses take place and a
continuous one corresponding to the geodesic motion in-between impulses. The
subsequent distributions are then solutions of partial differential equations
which contain derivatives with respect to both time variables.

  sensing","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1304.0002",,,,"cs.IT math.IT stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Under-determined systems of linear equations with sparse solutions have been
the subject of an extensive research in last several years above all due to
results of \cite{CRT,CanRomTao06,DonohoPol}. In this paper we will consider
\emph{noisy} under-determined linear systems. In a breakthrough
\cite{CanRomTao06} it was established that in \emph{noisy} systems for any
linear level of under-determinedness there is a linear sparsity that can be
\emph{approximately} recovered through an SOCP (second order cone programming)
optimization algorithm so that the approximate solution vector is (in an
$\ell_2$-norm sense) guaranteed to be no further from the sparse unknown vector
than a constant times the noise. In our recent work \cite{StojnicGenSocp10} we
established an alternative framework that can be used for statistical
performance analysis of the SOCP algorithms. To demonstrate how the framework
works we then showed in \cite{StojnicGenSocp10} how one can use it to precisely
characterize the \emph{generic} (worst-case) performance of the SOCP. In this
paper we present a different set of results that can be obtained through the
framework of \cite{StojnicGenSocp10}. The results will relate to \emph{problem
dependent} performance analysis of SOCP's. We will consider specific types of
unknown sparse vectors and characterize the SOCP performance when used for
recovery of such vectors. We will also show that our theoretical predictions
are in a solid agreement with the results one can get through numerical
simulations.

form decisions from incomplete data in diagnostic problems has highlighted
probabilistic methods [5] which compute posterior probabilities from prior
distributions in a way similar to Bayes Rule, and thus are called Bayesian
methods. This paper documents the use of a Bayesian method in a real time
problem which is similar to medical diagnosis in that there is a need to form
decisions and take some action without complete knowledge of conditions in the
problem domain. This particular method has a limitation which is discussed.

suggests that life began before the Earth was formed. Life may have started
from systems with single heritable elements that are functionally equivalent to
a nucleotide. The genetic complexity, roughly measured by the number of
non-redundant functional nucleotides, is expected to have grown exponentially
due to several positive feedback factors: gene cooperation, duplication of
genes with their subsequent specialization, and emergence of novel functional
niches associated with existing genes. Linear regression of genetic complexity
on a log scale extrapolated back to just one base pair suggests the time of the
origin of life 9.7 billion years ago. This cosmic time scale for the evolution
of life has important consequences: life took ca. 5 billion years to reach the
complexity of bacteria; the environments in which life originated and evolved
to the prokaryote stage may have been quite different from those envisaged on
Earth; there was no intelligent life in our universe prior to the origin of
Earth, thus Earth could not have been deliberately seeded with life by
intelligent aliens; Earth was seeded by panspermia; experimental replication of
the origin of life from scratch may have to emulate many cumulative rare
events; and the Drake equation for guesstimating the number of civilizations in
the universe is likely wrong, as intelligent life has just begun appearing in
our universe. Evolution of advanced organisms has accelerated via development
of additional information-processing systems: epigenetic memory, primitive
mind, multicellular brain, language, books, computers, and Internet. As a
result the doubling time of complexity has reached ca. 20 years. Finally, we
discuss the issue of the predicted technological singularity and give a
biosemiotics perspective on the increase of complexity.

of long-mysterious dark matter and dark energy. The postulate of universal
conformal local Weyl scaling symmetry, without dark matter, modifies action
integrals for both Einstein-Hilbert gravitation and the Higgs scalar field by
nonclassical gravitational terms. Conformal theory accounts both for observed
excessive external galactic orbital velocities and for accelerating cosmic
expansion. SU(2) symmetry-breaking is retained but dark energy is implied
rather than nonzero Higgs particle mass. These results are compatible with
existence of a massive neutral particle or resonance $W_2$ at 125GeV, described
as composite scalar $g_{\mu\nu}W_-^\mu W_+^\nu$ and $g_{\mu\nu}Z^{\mu*}Z^\nu$
interacting strongly via quark exchange. Decay modes would be consistent with
those observed at LHC. Higgs scalar field $\Phi$ is dressed by the $W_2$ field
to produce Lagrangian term $\lambda(\Phi^\dagger\Phi)^2$.

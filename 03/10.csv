active stars show larger photometric variability. Interestingly, the
measurements and reconstructions of the solar irradiance show that the Sun is
significantly less variable than indicated by the empirical relationship. Aims.
We aim to identify possible reasons for the Sun to be currently outside of this
relationship. Methods. We employed different scenarios of solar HK emission and
irradiance variability and compared them with available time series of Sun-like
stars. Results. We show that the position of the Sun on the diagram of
photometric variability versus chromospheric activity changes with time. The
present solar position is different from its temporal mean position as the
satellite era of continuous solar irradiance measurements has accidentally
coincided with a period of unusually high and stable solar activity. Our
analysis suggests that although present solar variability is significantly
smaller than indicated by the stellar data, the temporal mean solar variability
might be in agreement with the stellar data. We propose that the continuation
of the photometric program and its expansion to a larger stellar sample will
ultimately allow us to constrain the historical solar variability.

episodes sometimes preceded or accompanied by focal neurological symptoms
called aura. The relation between two subtypes, migraine without aura (MWoA)
and migraine with aura (MWA), is explored with the aim to identify targets for
neuromodulation techniques. To this end, a dynamically regulated control system
is schematically reduced to a network of the trigeminal nerve, which innervates
the cranial circulation, an associated descending modulatory network of
brainstem nuclei, and parasympathetic vasomotor efferents. This extends the
idea of a migraine generator region in the brainstem to a larger network and is
still simple and explicit enough to open up possibilities for mathematical
modeling in the future. In this study, it is suggested that the migraine
generator network (MGN) is driven and may therefore respond differently to
different spatio-temporal noxious input in the migraine subtypes MWA and MWoA.
The noxious input is caused by a cortical perturbation of homeostasis, known as
spreading depression (SD). The MGN might even trigger SD in the first place by
a failure in vasomotor control. As a consequence, migraine is considered as an
inherently dynamical disease to which a linear course from upstream to
downstream events would not do justice. Minimally invasive and noninvasive
neuromodulation techniques are briefly reviewed and their rational is discussed
in the context of the proposed mechanism.

Two typical algorithms for this problem: $l_0$-least mean square ($l_0$-LMS)
algorithm and $l_0$-exponentially forgetting window LMS ($l_0$-EFWLMS)
algorithm are hence introduced here. Both the algorithms utilize a zero
attraction method, which has been implemented by minimizing a continuous
approximation of $l_0$ norm of the studied signal. To improve the performances
of these proposed algorithms, an $l_0$-zero attraction projection ($l_0$-ZAP)
algorithm is also adopted, which has effectively accelerated their convergence
rates, making them much faster than the other existing algorithms for this
problem. Advantages of the proposed approach, such as its robustness against
noise etc., are demonstrated by numerical experiments.

Partition functions (elliptic genera) are conveniently transformed into product
expressions, which may inherit the homology properties of appropriate
(poly)graded Lie algebras. Specifically, the role of (Selberg-type) Ruelle
spectral functions of hyperbolic geometry in the calculation of partition
functions and associated $q$-series are discussed. Examples of these connection
in quantum field theory are considered (in particular, within the AdS/CFT

functions, whereas on the CFT side, partition functions and modular forms
arise. These objects are here shown to have a common background, expressible in
terms of Euler-Poincar\'e and Macdonald identities, which, in turn, describe
homological aspects of (finite or infinite) Lie algebra representations.
Finally, some other applications of modular forms and spectral functions

measurement outcomes obtained from the controlled system. Accordingly,
measurement errors affect the entropy production in the system. We explore this
issue in the context of active feedback cooling by modeling a typical cold
damping setup as a harmonic oscillator in contact with a heat reservoir and
submitted to a velocity-dependent feedback force that reduces the random
motion. We consider two models that distinguish whether the sensor continuously
measures the position of the resonator or directly its velocity (in practice,
an electric current). Adopting the standpoint of the controlled system, we
identify the `entropy pumping' contribution that describes the entropy
reduction due to the feedback control and that modifies the second law of
thermodynamics. We also assign a relaxation dynamics to the feedback mechanism
and compare the apparent entropy production in the system and the heat bath to
the total entropy production in the super-system that includes the controller.
In this context, entropy pumping reflects the existence of hidden degrees of
freedom and the apparent entropy production satisfies fluctuation theorems
associated to an effective Langevin dynamics.

converge to (arbitrarily precise) approximations of Nash equilibria in

this duality further to design a discrete-time, payoff-based learning algorithm

their in-game payoffs: moreover, the algorithm remains robust in the presence
of stochastic perturbations and observation errors, and it does not require any

supersymmetric versions of SU(2) and SO(5) VBS states, i.e. UOSp(N|2) and
UOSp(N|4) SVBS states whose mathematics are closely related to fuzzy two- and
four-superspheres. The SVBS states are physically interpreted as hole-doped VBS
states with superconducting property that interpolate various VBS states
depending on value of a hole-doping parameter. The parent Hamiltonians for SVBS
states are explicitly constructed, and their gapped excitations are derived

parameter and entanglement spectra. It is realized that the entanglement
spectra are at least doubly degenerate regardless of the parity of bulk

  Networks under Static Failures and Targeted Attacks",,,,,"cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  Peer to peer systems are the networks consisting of a group of nodes possible
to be as wide as the Internet. These networks are required of evaluation
mechanisms and distributed control and configurations, so each peer will be
able to communicate with other peers. Resilience to faults, failures and
attacks, are the main requirements of most communication systems and networks
today. Thus, since P2P networks can be individually used as an infrastructure
and an alternative for many other communication networks, they have to be more
reliable, and resilient to the faults, failures and attacks compared to the
client and server approach. In this work, we present a detailed study on the
behavior of various P2P networks toward faults and failures, and focus on
fault-tolerance subject. We consider two different static failure scenarios:
a)a random strategy in which nodes or edges of the network will be removed with
an equal probability and without any knowledge of the networks infrastructure,
b)a targeted strategy that uses some information about the nodes, and in which
the nodes with the highest degree have the most priority to be attacked. By
static faults, we mean a situation where the nodes or components encounter some
faults before the network starts to work or through its operation, and will
remain faulty to the end of the work session. Our goal is to introduce various
measures to analyzing P2P networks evaluating their vulnerability rate. The
presented criteria can be used for evaluating the reliability and vulnerability
of P2P networks toward both random and targeted failures. There is no limit to
the number and types of failures, the presented measures are able to be used
for different types of failures and even a wide range of networks.

by varying some of the parameters in the Hamiltonian periodically in time. The
specific model we consider is a chain containing spinless electrons with a
nearest-neighbor hopping amplitude, a p-wave superconducting term and a
chemical potential; this is equivalent to a spin-1/2 chain with anisotropic XY
couplings between nearest neighbors and a magnetic field applied in the
z-direction. We show that varying the chemical potential (or magnetic field)
periodically in time can produce Majorana modes at the ends of a long chain. We
discuss two kinds of periodic driving, periodic delta-function kicks and a
simple harmonic variation with time. We discuss some distinctive features of
the end modes such as the inverse participation ratio of their wave functions
and their Floquet eigenvalues which are always equal to +/- 1 for time-reversal
symmetric systems. For the case of periodic delta-function kicks, we use the
effective Hamiltonian of a system with periodic boundary conditions to define
two topological invariants. The first invariant is a well-known winding number
while the second invariant has not appeared in the literature before. The
second invariant is more powerful in that it always correctly predicts the
numbers of end modes with Floquet eigenvalues equal to +1 and -1, while the
first invariant does not. We find that the number of end modes can become very
large as the driving frequency decreases. We show that periodic delta-function
kicks in the hopping and superconducting terms can also produce end modes.
Finally, we study the effect of electron-phonon interactions (which are
relevant at finite temperatures) and a random noise in the chemical potential
on the Majorana modes.

present, the pion DA can not be definitely determined from the pion-photon TFF.
it is crucial to find the right pion DA behavior and to determine which data is
more reliable. In this letter, we perform a combined analysis of the most
existing data of the processes involving pion by using a general model for the
pion wavefunction/DA. Such a DA model can mimic all the existed pion DA
behaviors, whose parameters can be fixed by the constraints from the processes
$\pi^0\to\gamma\gamma$, $\pi\to\mu\nu$, $B\to\pi l \nu$, and etc. Especially,
we examine the $B \rightarrow \pi$ transition form factors that provides
another constraint to the parameter $B$ in our DA model, which results in $B
\in[0.00,0.29]$. This inversely shows that the predicted curve for the
pion-photon TFF is between the BABAR and Belle data in the region $Q^2\in$
$[15,40]$ GeV$^2$. It will be tested by coming more accurate data at large
$Q^2$ region, and the definite behavior of pion DA can be concluded finally.

show that: a) map-aware estimation accuracy can be related to some features of
the map (e.g., its shape and area) even though, in general, the relation is
complicated; b) maps are really useful in the presence of some combination of
low signal-to-noise ratios and specific geometrical features of the map (e.g.,
the size of obstructions); c) in most cases, there is no need of refined maps

is revealed. An exceptionally highly excited state of He is observed and a
peculiarity for the excitation function of the resonance line is explained. The
intensity ratio for the excitation of the K II \lambda = 60.1 nm and \lambda =
61.2 nm lines is 5:1 which indicates the high probability for excitation of the
singlet resonance level $^{1}$P$_{1}$ compared to the triplet level
$^{3}$P$_{1}$. The similarity of the population of the 4p state of the
potassium ion and atom as well as the anomalously small values of the
excitation cross sections are explained.

keep in mind in the framework of the asteroseismic studies of such stars. 2)

rotating stars. The values presently obtained are in agreement with the very
few values obtained for B-type stars from asteroseismology. 3) At Z = 0.002,
the stars in the mass range of 1.7 to 3 Msun with a mean velocity on the MS of
the order of 150 km/s show N/H enhancement superior to 0.2 dex at mid-MS, and
superior to 0.4 dex at the end of the MS phase. At solar metallicity the

their life bringing pain, functional limitations, social and economic
implications. Modern medicine cannot offer prevention and effective treatment
for most chronic musculoskeletal conditions, because their etiology and
pathogenesis are unknown. This is due to the lack of systemic understanding of
the locomotor system functioning in both healthy and unhealthy states. Here we
apply systems sciences to analyze the human locomotor system and develop a
general theory that reveals the systemic destructive process in the locomotor
system, linking together all its disorders. The systemic destruction involves
adaptation and self-organization processes in the locomotor system, whose side
effects introduce a positive feedback loop with nervous and vascular
disturbances. Most chronic musculoskeletal conditions are just manifestations
and consequences of this process. On the basis of our theoretical findings, we
developed the world's first technology that effectively counteracts the
systemic destruction and improves the locomotor system state at any age, also
preventing problems in nervous and cardiovascular systems.

sine and cosine function and the bisection formula for the cotangent function
that leads to a generalization of the classical Shafer-Fink inequality $
\frac{3 x}{1+2\sqrt{1+x^2}} < \arctan x < \frac{\pi x}{1+2\sqrt{1+x^2}}$. Other
algebraic approximations are also shown, including one that follows from the
Chebyshev expansion for the arctangent function in the interval $[-1,1]$.

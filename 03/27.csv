while random network coding (RNC) is a network layer strategy. An interesting
question is how resource allocation mechanisms can be tuned to improve RNC
performance. By means of a differential equation framework which models RNC
throughput in terms of lower layer parameters, we propose a gradient based
approach that can dynamically allocate MAC and PHY layer resources with the
goal of maximizing the minimum network coding throughput among all the
destination nodes in a RNC multicast. We exemplify this general approach with
two resource allocation problems: (i) power control to improve network coding
throughput, and (ii) CSMA mean backoff delay control to improve network coding
throughput. We design both centralized algorithms and online algorithms for
power control and CSMA backoff control. Our evaluations, including numerically
solving the differential equations in the centralized algorithm and an
event-driven simulation for the online algorithm, show that such gradient based
dynamic resource allocation yields significant throughput improvement of the
destination nodes in RNC. Further, our numerical results reveal that network
coding aware power control can regain the broadcast advantage of wireless
transmissions to improve the throughput.

matrix X from an m\times m matrix Y=AXB^T, where A and B are known m \times p

  The main result shows that there exist constructions of the ""sketching""
matrices A and B so that even if X has O(p) non-zeros, it can be recovered
exactly and efficiently using a convex program as long as these non-zeros are
not concentrated in any single row/column of X. Furthermore, it suffices for
the size of Y (the sketch dimension) to scale as m = O(\sqrt{# nonzeros in X}
\times log p). The results also show that the recovery is robust and stable in
the sense that if X is equal to a sparse matrix plus a perturbation, then the
convex program we propose produces an approximation with accuracy proportional
to the size of the perturbation. Unlike traditional results on sparse recovery,
where the sensing matrix produces independent measurements, our sensing
operator is highly constrained (it assumes a tensor product structure).
Therefore, proving recovery guarantees require non-standard techniques. Indeed
our approach relies on a novel result concerning tensor products of bipartite
graphs, which may be of independent interest.
  This problem is motivated by the following application, among others.
Consider a p\times n data matrix D, consisting of n observations of p
variables. Assume that the correlation matrix X:=DD^{T} is (approximately)
sparse in the sense that each of the p variables is significantly correlated
with only a few others. Our results show that these significant correlations
can be detected even if we have access to only a sketch of the data S=AD with A

Similar to the canonical transformation theory of point dynamics, the canonical
transformation rules for fields are derived from generating functions.
Thus---in contrast to the usual Lagrangian description---the covariant
canonical transformation formalism automatically ensures the mappings to
preserve the action principle, and hence to be {\em physical}. On that basis,
we work out the theory of inhomogeneous local gauge transformations that
generalizes the conventional local SU(N) gauge transformation theory. It is
shown that massive gauge bosons naturally emerge in this description, which
thus could supersede the Higgs mechanism.

problems and their mitigation is urgently needed. The use of zeolite membranes
is a very efficient way in order to capture CO2 from some flue gases. The
dominant transport mechanism at low temperature andor high pressure is the
diffusion through the membrane. This procedure can be divided in three steps:
Adsorption of the molecules of the species in the surface of the membrane, then
a driving force gives a path where the species follow inside the membrane and
finally the species desorbed from the surface of the membrane. The current work
is aimed at developing a simulation model for the CO2 transport through a
zeolite membrane and estimate the diffusion phenomenon through a very thin
membrane of 150 nm in a Wicke-Kallenbach cell. The cell is cylindrical in shape
with diameter of 19 mm and consists of a retentate gas chamber, a permeate gas
chamber which are separated by a cylindrical zeolite membrane. This apparatus
have been modeled with Comsol Multiphysics software. The gas chosen to insert
in the retentate gas chamber is CO2 and the inert gas is Argon. The
Maxwell-Stefan surface equations used in order to calculate the velocity
gradients inside the zeolite membrane and in order to solve the velocity
profile within the permeate and retentate gas chamber, the incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations were solved. Finally, the mass balance equation for
both gases solved with the mass balance differential equations. Validation of
our model has been obtained at low and high temperatures suggesting that higher
the temperature the better the results.

result to a global version. We think of the spectrum of a Dirac operator as a
function from the integers to the reals and endow the space of all spectra with
an arsinh-uniform metric. We prove that the spectrum of the Dirac operator
depends continuously on the Riemannian metric. As a corollary, we obtain the
existence of a non-decreasing family of functions on the space of all
Riemannian metrics, which represents the entire Dirac spectrum at any metric.
We also show that in general these functions do not descend to the space of
Riemannian metrics modulo spin diffeomorphisms due to spectral flow.

the uncertainty in the inferred distances and hence cosmological parameters. In

using a simple halo model. We use mock catalogues from the Millennium
Simulation, and calibrate and compare our reconstructed P(kappa) to ray-traced
kappa ""truth"" values; taking into account realistic observational
uncertainties. We find that the reconstruction of kappa provides an improvement
in precision of ~50% over galaxy number counts. We find that the lowest-kappa
lines of sight have the best constrained P(kappa). In anticipation of large
future samples of lenses, we find that selecting the third of the systems with
the highest precision kappa estimates gives a sample of unbiased time delay
distance measurements with just ~1% uncertainty due to line of sight external
convergence effects. Photometric data are sufficient to pre-select the
best-constrained lines of sight, and can be done before investment in
light-curve monitoring. Conversely, we show that selecting lines of sight with
high external shear could, with the reconstruction model presented, induce
biases of up to 1% in time delay distance. We find that a major potential
source of systematic error is uncertainty in the high mass end of the stellar
mass-halo mass relation; this could introduce ~2% biases on the time-delay

  reflective symmetry about a known median direction","23 pages, 2 figures",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose optimal tests for circular reflective symmetry
about a fixed median direction. The distributions against which optimality is
achieved are the so-called k-sine-skewed distributions of Umbach and
Jammalamadaka (2009). We first show that sequences of k-sine-skewed models are
locally and asymptotically normal in the vicinity of reflective symmetry.
Following the Le Cam methodology, we then construct optimal (in the maximin
sense) parametric tests for reflective symmetry, which we render
semi-parametric by a studentization argument. These asymptotically
distribution-free tests happen to be uniformly optimal (under any reference
density) and are moreover of a very simple and intuitive form. They furthermore
exhibit nice small sample properties, as we show through a Monte Carlo
simulation study. Our new tests also allow us to re-visit the famous red wood
ants data set of Jander (1957). We further show that one of the proposed
parametric tests can as well serve as a test for uniformity against cardioid
alternatives; this test coincides with the famous circular Rayleigh (1919) test
for uniformity which is thus proved to be (also) optimal against cardioid
alternatives. Moreover, our choice of k-sine-skewed alternatives, which are the
circular analogues of the classical linear skew-symmetric distributions,
permits us a Fisher singularity analysis \`a la Hallin and Ley (2012) with the
result that only the prominent sine-skewed von Mises distribution suffers from
these inferential drawbacks. Finally, we conclude the paper by discussing the
unspecified location case.

galaxies magnified by foreground clusters. Using 300,000 BOSS-Survey galaxies
with accurate spectroscopic redshifts, we measure their mean redshift depth
behind four large samples of optically selected clusters from the SDSS surveys,
totalling 5,000-15,000 clusters. A clear trend of increasing mean redshift
towards the cluster centers is found, averaged over each of the four cluster
samples. In addition we find similar but noisier behaviour for an independent
X-ray sample of 158 clusters lying in the foreground of the current BOSS sky
area. By adopting the mass-richness relationships appropriate for each survey
we compare our results with theoretical predictions for each of the four SDSS
cluster catalogs. The radial form of this redshift enhancement is well fitted
by a richness-to-mass weighted composite Navarro-Frenk-White profile with an
effective mass ranging between M_200 ~ 1.4-1.8 10^14 M_sun for the optically
detected cluster samples, and M_200 ~ 5.0 10^14 M_sun for the X-ray sample.
This lensing detection helps to establish the credibility of these SDSS cluster
surveys, and provides a normalization for their respective mass-richness
relations. In the context of the upcoming bigBOSS, Subaru-PFS, and EUCLID-NISP
spectroscopic surveys, this method represents an independent means of deriving
the masses of cluster samples for examining the cosmological evolution, and
provides a relatively clean consistency check of weak-lensing measurements,

dipole at the location of X-ray selected galaxy clusters, corresponding to a
large-scale bulk flow extending at least to $z\sim 0.18$, the median redshift
of the cluster sample. The amplitude of this flow, as measured with Planck, is
consistent with earlier findings based on data from the Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). However, the uncertainty assigned to the dipole by the
Planck team is much larger than that found in the WMAP studies, leading the
authors of the Planck study to conclude that the observed bulk flow is not
statistically significant. We here show that two of the three implementations
of random sampling used in the error analysis of the Planck study lead to
systematic overestimates in the uncertainty of the measured dipole. Random
simulations of the sky do not take into account that the actual realization of
the sky leads to filtered data that have a 12% lower root-mean-square
dispersion than the average simulation. Using rotations around the Galactic
pole (the Z axis), increases the uncertainty of the X and Y components of the
dipole and artificially reduces the significance of the dipole detection from
98-99% to less than 90% confidence. When either effect is taken into account,
the corrected errors agree with those obtained using random distributions of
clusters on Planck data, and the resulting statistical significance of the

function of velocity dispersion, sigma, from 90 km/s to 300 km/s. The spectra
are of extremely high quality, with typical S/N of 1000/A, and a wavelength
coverage of 4000A-8800A. Our population synthesis model includes variation in
16 elements from C to Ba, the shift in effective temperature, Delta(Teff), of
the stars with respect to a solar metallicity isochrone, amongst other
parameters. In our approach we fit the full optical spectra rather than a
select number of spectral indices and are able to, for the first time, measure
the abundances of the elements V, Cr, Mn, Co, and Ni from the integrated light
of distant galaxies. Our main results are as follows: 1) light-weighted stellar
ages range from 6-12 Gyr from low to high sigma; 2) [Fe/H] varies by less than
0.1 dex across the entire sample; 3) Mg closely tracks O, and both increase
from ~0.0 at low sigma to ~0.25 at high sigma; Si and Ti show a shallower rise
with sigma, and Ca tracks Fe rather than O; 4) the iron peak elements V, Cr,
Mn, and Ni track Fe, while Co tracks O, suggesting that Co forms primarily in
massive stars; 5) C and N track O over the full sample and [C/Fe] and [N/Fe]
exceed 0.2 at high sigma; and 6) the variation in Delta(Teff) with total
metallicity follows theoretical predictions based on stellar evolution theory.
Our derived [Mg/Fe] and [O/Fe] abundance ratios are 0.05-0.1 dex lower than
most previous determinations. Under the conventional interpretation that the
variation in these ratios is due to star formation timescale variations, our
results suggest longer star formation timescales for massive early-type
galaxies than previous studies. (ABRIDGED)

observed dependence of integrated spectral properties on galaxy inclination. We
develop an innovative combination of generic models of radiative transfer (RT)
in dusty media with a prescription for the spectral evolution of galaxies, via
the association of different geometric components of galaxies with stars in
different age ranges. We show that a wide range of RT models all predict a
quasi-universal relation between slope of the attenuation curve at any
wavelength and V-band attenuation optical depth in the diffuse interstellar
medium (ISM), at all galaxy inclinations. This relation predicts steeper
(shallower) dust attenuation curves than both the Calzetti and MW curves at
small (large) attenuation optical depths, which implies that geometry and
orientation effects have a stronger influence on the shape of the attenuation
curve than changes in the optical properties of dust grains. We use our
combined RT and spectral evolution model to interpret the observed dependence
of the H\alpha/H\beta\ ratio and ugrizYJH attenuation curve on inclination in a
sample of ~23 000 nearby star-forming galaxies. From a Bayesian MCMC fit, we
measure the central face-on B-band optical depth of this sample to be
tau_B\perp~1.8\pm0.2. We also quantify the enhanced optical depth towards newly
formed stars in their birth clouds, finding this to be significantly larger in
galaxies with bulges than in disc-dominated galaxies, while tau_B\perp is
roughly similar in both cases. Finally, we show that neglecting the effect of
geometry and orientation on attenuation can severely bias the interpretation of
galaxy spectral energy distributions, as the impact on broadband colours can
reach up to 0.3-0.4 mag at optical wavelengths and 0.1 mag at near-infrared

Provided that the axion decays (at least partly) into photons, these models
naturally give rise to a box-shaped gamma-ray spectrum that may present two
distinct phenomenological behaviours: a narrow box, resembling a line at half
the dark matter mass, or a wide box, spanning an extensive energy range up to
the dark matter mass. Remarkably, we find that in both cases a sizable
gamma-ray flux is predicted for a thermal relic without fine-tuning the model
parameters nor invoking boost factors. This large output is in line with recent
Fermi-LAT observations towards the Galactic centre region and is on the verge

derive robust, model-independent upper limits on the dark matter annihilation
cross section for the narrow and wide box scenarios. H.E.S.S. constraints, in
particular, turn out to match the ones from Fermi-LAT at hundreds of GeV and
extend to multi-TeV masses. Future Cherenkov telescopes will likely probe

the lines of sight to the sources, thus allowing to disentangle the two plasma
properties that contribute to the observed RMs. By comparing the observed RM
values to those theoretically predicted by a power-law model of the radial

found that the radial component of the inner heliospheric magnetic field can be
nicely approximated by a power-law of the form B_r = 3.76 r^{-2.29} G in a
range of heights from about 5 to 14 solar radii. Finally, our analysis suggests

There is no obvious sign of interaction for many local DOGs. No local DOGs have
companions with comparable optical magnitudes closer than ~50 kpc. The large-
and small-scale environments of DOGs are similar to the control sample. Many
physical properties of local DOGs are similar to those of high-z DOGs, even
though the IR luminosities of local objects are an order of magnitude lower
than for the high-z objects: the presence of two classes (active galactic
nuclei- and star formation-dominated) of DOGs, abnormal faintness in the UV

morphology. These results suggest a common underlying physical origin of local

evolution of pressurised bubbles driven by supernovae in a multi-phase
interstellar medium (ISM). The bubbles are followed until the point of
break-out into the halo, starting from an initial adiabatic phase to a
radiative phase. We show that a key property which sets the fate of bubbles in
the ISM is the gas surface density, through the work done by the expansion of
bubbles and its role in setting the gas scaleheight. The multi-phase
description of the ISM is essential, and neglecting it leads to order of
magnitude differences in the predicted outflow rates. We compare our predicted
mass loading and outflow velocities to observations of local and high-redshift
galaxies and find good agreement over a wide range of stellar masses and
velocities. With the aim of analysing the dependence of the mass loading of the
outflow, beta (i.e. the ratio between the outflow and star formation rates), on
galaxy properties, we embed our model in the galaxy formation simulation,
GALFORM, set in the LCDM framework. We find that a dependence of beta solely on
the circular velocity, as is widely assumed in the literature, is actually a
poor description of the outflow rate, as large variations with redshift and
galaxy properties are obtained. Moreover, we find that below a circular
velocity of 80km/s the mass loading saturates. A more fundamental relation is
that between beta and the gas scaleheight of the disk, hg, and the gas
fraction, fgas, as beta hg^(1.1) fgas^(0.4), or the gas surface density,
\Sigma_g, and the gas fraction, as beta \Sigma_g^(-0.6) fgas^(0.8). We find

current limits. The mono-b signal arises partly from direct production of
b-quarks in association with dark matter, but the dominant component is from
top quark pair production in the kinematic regime where one top is boosted. A
search for tops plus missing energy can strengthen the bounds even more; in
this case signal and background have very different missing energy

point the collisional partners are very poorly correlated and so the results
should be robust for even larger stopping time ratios. Significantly, we find
that while particles of very different masses have approximately Maxwellian
collisional statistics, as the mass ratio shrinks the distribution changes
dramatically. At small stopping time ratios, the collisional partners are
highly correlated and we find a population of high number density (clustered),
low relative-velocity particle pairs. Unlike in the case of identical stopping
time collisional partners, this low relative-velocity clustered population is
collisional, but the clustering is barely adequate to trigger bulk effects such
as the streaming instability. We conclude our analysis by constructing a master
fit to the collisional statistics as a function only of the stopping time

accretion luminosity Lx of only (1-10)x1E34 erg s-1 (i.e., only ~0.005-0.05 %
of the Eddington limit). The phenomenology of accreting neutron stars which
accrete at such low accretion rates is not yet well known and the reason why
they have such low accretion rates is also not clear. Therefore, we have
obtained XMM-Newton data of these three sources and here we report our analysis
of the high-quality X-ray spectra we have obtained for them. We find that AX
J1754.2-2754 has Lx~1E35 erg s-1, while the other two have X-ray luminosities
about an order of magnitude lower. However, all sources have a similar,
relatively soft, spectrum with a photon index of 2.3-2.5, when the spectrum is
fitted with an absorbed power-law model. This model fits the data of AX

thermal component is needed to fit their spectra. This soft component
contributes 40% - 50% to the 0.5-10 keV flux of the sources. When including
this additional spectral component, the power-law photon indices are
significantly lower. It can be excluded that a similar component with similar
contributions to the 2-10 keV X-ray flux is present for AX J1754.2-2754,
indicating that the soft spectrum of this source is mostly due to the fact that
the power-law component itself is not hard. We note that we cannot excluded
that weaker soft component is present in the spectrum of this source which only
contributes up to ~25% to the 0.5-10 keV X-ray flux. We discuss our results in

to systems of higher order. P-type orbits occur when the planet orbits both
binary components, whereas in case of S-type orbits the planet orbits only one
of the binary components with the second component considered a perturbator.
The selected approach encapsulates a variety of different aspects, which
include: (1) The consideration of a joint constraint including orbital
stability and a habitable environment for a putative system planet through the
stellar radiative energy fluxes (""radiative habitable zone""; RHZ) needs to be
met. (2) The treatment of conservative, general and extended zones of
habitability for the various systems as defined for the Solar System and
beyond. (3) The providing of a combined formalism for the assessment of both
S-type and P-type habitability; in particular, mathematical criteria are
presented for which kind of system S-type and P-type habitability is realized.
(4) Applications of the attained theoretical approach to standard (theoretical)
main-sequence stars. In principle, five different cases of habitability are
identified, which are: S-type and P-type habitability provided by the full
extent of the RHZs; habitability, where the RHZs are truncated by the
additional constraint of planetary orbital stability (referred to as ST and
PT-type, respectively); and cases of no habitability at all. Regarding the
treatment of planetary orbital stability, we utilize the formulae of Holman &
Wiegert (1999) [AJ 117, 621], as also used by previous studies. In this work we
focus on binary systems in circular orbits. Future applications will also
consider binary systems in elliptical orbits and provide thorough comparisons

at low applied strain rates, there is a one-to-one correspondence with the
randomly nucleated isolated bursts of mobile dislocation density and the stress
drops. We then show that the model equations are spatiotemporally chaotic by
demonstrating the number of positive Lyapunov exponents and Lyapunov dimension
scale with the system size at low and high strain rates. Using a modified
algorithm for calculating correlation dimension density, we show that the
stress-strain signals at low applied strain rates corresponding to spatially
uncorrelated dislocation bands exhibit features of low dimensional chaos. This
is made quantitative by demonstrating that the model equations can be
approximately reduced to space independent model equations for the average
dislocation densities, which is known to be low-dimensionally chaotic. However,
the scaling regime for the correlation dimension shrinks with increasing

gravitational potential's range, i.e., partially shields the lensing potential
because the lens mass is made a contributor to the mean mass density of the
universe and not simply superimposed upon it. We give the time-delay function
for the embedded point mass lens from which we can derive the simplified lens
equation by applying Fermat's least-time principle. Even though rigorous
derivations are only made for the point mass in a flat background, the
generalization of the lens equation to lowest-order for any distributed lens in
any homogeneous background is obvious. We find from this simplified theory that
embedding can introduce corrections above the few percent level in weak lensing
shears caused by large clusters but only at large impacts. The potential part
of the time delay is also affected in strong lensing at the few percent level.

Galactic bulge of the Milky Way. Our aim is to understand the formation of the
Galactic bulge. We examine the kinematics of about 17,400 stars in the bulge
located within 3.5 kpc of the Galactic centre, identified from the 28,000 star
ARGOS survey. We aim to determine if the formation of the bulge has been
internally driven from disk instabilities as suggested by its boxy shape, or if
mergers have played a significant role as expected from Lambda CDM simulations.
From our velocity measurements across latitudes b = -5 deg, -7.5 deg and -10
deg we find the bulge to be a cylindrically rotating system that transitions
smoothly out into the disk. Within the bulge, we find a kinematically distinct
metal-poor population ([Fe/H] < -1.0) that is not rotating cylindrically. The
5% of our stars with [Fe/H] < -1.0 are a slowly rotating spheroidal population,
which we believe are stars of the metal weak thick disk and halo which
presently lie in the inner Galaxy. The kinematics of the two bulge components
that we identified in ARGOS paper III (mean [Fe/H] = -0.25 and [Fe/H] = +0.15,
respectively) demonstrate that they are likely to share a common formation
origin and are distinct from the more metal poor populations of the thick disk
and halo which are colocated inside the bulge. We do not exclude an underlying
merger generated bulge component but our results favour bulge formation from
instabilities in the early thin disk.

by Perley & Butler (2013). We show images and profiles of spectral index over
the frequency range 1.4 - 8.5 GHz, together with values integrated over
fiducial regions defined by our relativistic models of the jets. We find that
the spectral index decreases (the spectrum flattens) with distance from the
nucleus in all of the jets. The mean spectral indices are 0.66 +/- 0.01 where
the jets first brighten abruptly and 0.59 +/- 0.01 after they recollimate. The
mean change in spectral index between these locations, which is independent of
calibration and flux-density scale errors and is therefore more accurately and
robustly measured, is -0.067 +/- 0.006. Our jet models associate the decrease
in spectral index with a bulk deceleration of the flow from 0.8c to <0.5c. We
suggest that the decrease is the result of a change in the characteristics of
ongoing particle acceleration. One possible acceleration mechanism is the
first-order Fermi process in mildly relativistic shocks: in the Bohm limit, the
index of the electron energy spectrum, p, is slightly larger than 2 and
decreases with velocity upstream of the shock. This possibility is consistent
with our measurements, but requires shocks throughout the jet volume rather
than at a few discrete locations. A second possibility is that two acceleration
mechanisms operate in these jets: one (with p = 2.32) dominant close to the
galactic nucleus and associated with high flow speeds, another (with p = 2.18)
taking over at larger distances and slower flow speeds.

  12 figures, 3 tables",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent research indicates that many convex optimization problems with random
constraints exhibit a phase transition as the number of constraints increases.
For example, this phenomenon emerges in the $\ell_1$ minimization method for
identifying a sparse vector from random linear measurements. Indeed, the
$\ell_1$ approach succeeds with high probability when the number of
measurements exceeds a threshold that depends on the sparsity level; otherwise,
it fails with high probability.
  This paper provides the first rigorous analysis that explains why phase
transitions are ubiquitous in random convex optimization problems. It also
describes tools for making reliable predictions about the quantitative aspects
of the transition, including the location and the width of the transition
region. These techniques apply to regularized linear inverse problems with
random measurements, to demixing problems under a random incoherence model, and
also to cone programs with random affine constraints.
  The applied results depend on foundational research in conic geometry. This
paper introduces a summary parameter, called the statistical dimension, that
canonically extends the dimension of a linear subspace to the class of convex
cones. The main technical result demonstrates that the sequence of intrinsic
volumes of a convex cone concentrates sharply around the statistical dimension.
This fact leads to accurate bounds on the probability that a randomly rotated
cone shares a ray with a fixed cone.

to dynamical, e.g., finite-temperature, predictions based on classical ions and
static crystals. We also consider the influence of the chosen
exchange--correlation density functional on the predicted properties of
hydrogen, in particular, the pressure dependence of the band gap and the
zero-point energy. Finally, we use our simulations to make an assessment of the
accuracy of typically employed approximations to the calculation of the Gibbs
free energy of the solid, namely the quasi-harmonic approximation for solids.
We find that, while the approximation is capable of producing free energies
with an accuracy of ~10 meV, this is not enough to make reliable predictions of
the phase diagram of hydrogen from first-principles due to the small free
energy differences seen between several potential structures for the solid;
direct free energy calculations for quantum protons are required in order to

Value-at-Risk---are well defined on the larger space L^1 and this seems to be
the natural domain space for this risk measure. Spectral risk measures
constitute a further class of risk measures of central importance, and they are
often considered on some L^p space. But in many situations this is possibly
unnatural, because any L^p with p>p_0, say, is suitable to define the spectral
risk measure as well. In addition to that risk measures have also been
considered on Orlicz and Zygmund spaces. So it remains for discussion and
clarification, what the natural domain to consider a risk measure is? Abstract
This paper introduces a norm, which is built from the risk measure, and a
Banach space, which carries the risk measure in a natural way. It is often
strictly larger than its original domain, and obeys the key property that the
risk measure is finite valued and continuous on that space in an elementary and
natural way.

the last decades due to their great promise for providing a direct solution to
the many-body Schrodinger equation in electronic systems. Thanks to their low
scaling with number of particles, QMC methods present a compelling competitive
alternative for the accurate study of large molecular systems and solid state
calculations. In spite of such promise, the method has not permeated the
quantum chemistry community broadly, mainly because of the fixed-node error,
which can be large and whose control is difficult. In this Perspective, we
present a systematic application of large scale multi-determinant expansions in
QMC, and report on its impressive performance with first row dimers and the 55
molecules of the G1 test set. We demonstrate the potential of this strategy for
systematically reducing the fixed-node error in the wave function and for
achieving chemical accuracy in energy predictions. When compared to traditional
quantum chemistry methods like MP2, CCSD(T), and various DFT approximations,
the QMC results show a marked improvement over all of them. In fact, only the
explicitly-correlated CCSD(T) method with a large basis set produces more
accurate results. Further developments in trial wave functions and algorithmic
improvements appear promising for rendering QMC as the benchmark standard in
large electronic systems.

Fourier analysis of a single conventional direct image. In the high Strehl
ratio regime, the relation between the phase measured in the Fourier plane and
the wavefront errors in the pupil can be linearized, as was shown in a previous
work that introduced the notion of generalized closure-phase, or kernel-phase.
The technique, to be usable as presented requires two conditions to be met: (1)
the wavefront errors must be kept small (of the order of one radian or less)
and (2) the pupil must include some asymmetry, that can be introduced with a
mask, for the problem to become solvable. Simulations show that this asymmetric
pupil Fourier wavefront sensing or APF-WFS technique can improve the Strehl
ratio from 50 to over 90 % in just a few iterations, with excellent photon
noise sensitivity properties, suggesting that on-sky close loop APF-WFS is
possible with an extreme adaptive optics system.

procedure, due to its usefulness in data integration, data exchange, query
optimization, peer data exchange and data correspondence, to mention a few. As
the chase has been investigated and further developed by a number of research
groups and authors, many variants of the chase have emerged and associated
results obtained. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the area it is frequently
difficult to verify the scope of each result. In this paper we take closer look
at recent developments, and provide additional results. Our analysis allows us
create a taxonomy of the chase variations and the properties they satisfy.
  Two of the most central problems regarding the chase is termination, and
discovery of restricted classes of sets of dependencies that guarantee
termination of the chase. The search for the restricted classes has been
motivated by a fairly recent result that shows that it is undecidable to
determine whether the chase with a given dependency set will terminate on a
given instance. There is a small dissonance here, since the quest has been for
classes of sets of dependencies guaranteeing termination of the chase on all
instances, even though the latter problem was not known to be undecidable. We
resolve the dissonance in this paper by showing that determining whether the
chase with a given set of dependencies terminates on all instances is
coRE-complete. Our reduction also gives us the aforementioned
instance-dependent RE-completeness result as a byproduct. For one of the
restricted classes, the stratified sets dependencies, we provide new complexity
results for the problem of testing whether a given set of dependencies belongs
to it. These results rectify some previous claims that have occurred in the
literature.

tracking and particle identification for ultra-high multiplicity events. It is
the central tracking device of many experiments, e.g. the ALICE experiment at
CERN. The necessity of a switching electrostatic gate, which prevents ions
produced in the amplification region o MWPCs from entering the drift volume,
however, restricts its application to trigger rates of the order of 1 kHz.
  Charge amplification by Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) foils instead of
proportional wires offers an intrinsic suppression of the ion backflow,
although not to the same level as a gating grid. Detailed Monte Carlo
simulations have shown that the distortions due to residual space charge from
back-drifting ions can be limited to a few cm, and thus can be corrected using
standard calibration techniques. A prototype GEM-TPC has been built with the
largest active volume to date for a detector of this type. It has been
commissioned with cosmics and particle beams at the FOPI experiment at GSI, and
was employed for a physics measurement with pion beams.
  For future operation of the ALICE TPC at the CERN LHC beyond 2019, where
Pb-Pb collision rates of 50 kHz are expected, it is planned to replace the
existing MWPCs by GEM detectors, operated in a continuous, triggerless readout
mode, thus allowing an increase in event rate by a factor of 100. As a first
step of the R&D program, a prototype of an Inner Readout Chamber was equipped
with large-size GEM foils and exposed to beams of protons, pions and electrons
from the CERN PS.
  In this paper, new results are shown concerning ion backflow, spatial and
momentum resolution of the FOPI GEM-TPC, detector calibration, and dE/dx
resolution with both detector prototypes. The perspectives of a GEM-TPC for
ALICE with continuous readout will be discussed.

masses of the particles are negligible, different scheme has to be applied in
each energy scale in the analysis of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). In the soft
energy region (p gT), the simple perturbative expansion called the hard thermal
loop (HTL) approximation can be applied, and that approximation expects the
existence of the bosonic and fermionic collective excitations called plasmon
and plasmino. On the other hand, in the ultrasoft energy region (p g^2T), the
HTL approximation is inapplicable due to infrared singularity, so the question
whether there are any excitation modes in that energy region has not been
studied well. In this thesis, we analyze the quark spectrum whose energy is
ultrasoft in QGP, using the resummed perturbation theory which enables us to
successfully regularize the infrared singularity. Since the Yukawa model and
QED are simpler than QCD but have some similarity to QCD, we also work in these
models. As a result, we establish the existence of a novel fermionic mode in
the ultrasoft energy region, and obtain the expressions of the pole position
and the strength of that mode. We also show that the Ward-Takahashi identity is
satisfied in the resummed perturbation theory in QED/QCD. Furthermore, we
derive the linearized and generalized Boltzmann equation for the ultrasoft
fermion excitations in the Kadanoff-Baym formalism, and show that the resultant
equation is equivalent to the self-consistent equation in the resummed
perturbation theory. We also derive the equation which determines the n-point
functions with external lines for a pair of fermions and (n-2) bosons with
ultrasoft momenta, by considering the non-linear response regime using the
gauge symmetry. We also derive the Ward-Takahashi identity from the
conservation law of the electromagnetic current in the Kadanoff-Baym formalism.

Compact Array for the duration of the ~9 month event. The lightcurves show that
the radio emission from the compact jet persisted for the duration of an
extended hard state and through the transition to the intermediate state. The
flux then rose rapidly by a factor of 10 and the radio source entered a series
of at least 7 maxima, the first of which was likely to be emission associated
with the compact jet. The subsequent 6 flares were accompanied by variable
behaviour in terms of radio spectrum, degree of linear polarisation, morphology
and associated X-ray behaviour. They were, however, remarkably similar in terms
of the estimated minimum power required to launch such an ejection event. We
compare the timing of radio peaks with the location of the ejecta, imaged by
contemporaneous VLBI experiments. We then discuss the mechanism behind the
events, in terms of whether discrete ejections is the most likely description
of the behaviour. One ejection, at least, appears to be travelling with
apparent superluminal motion. The range of properties, however, suggests that
mutiple mechanisms may be relevant and that at least some of the emission is
coming from shocked interactions amongst the ejecta and between the ejecta and
the interstellar medium. We also compare the radio flux density with the X-ray
source during the hard state and conclude that XTE J1752-223 is a
radio-weak/X-ray-bright outlier on the universal correlation for black hole
transient sources.

a special use-case of this method. Flexibility is achieved by embedding a
general-purpose processor dedicated to plasticity into the wafer. To evaluate
the suitability of the proposed system, we use a reward modulated STDP rule in
a spike train learning task. A single layer of neurons is trained to fire at
specific points in time with only the reward as feedback. This model is
simulated to measure its performance, i.e. the increase in received reward
after learning. Using this performance as baseline, we then simulate the model
with various constraints imposed by the proposed implementation and compare the
performance. The simulated constraints include discretized synaptic weights, a
restricted interface between analog synapses and embedded processor, and
mismatch of analog circuits. We find that probabilistic updates can increase
the performance of low-resolution weights, a simple interface between analog
synapses and processor is sufficient for learning, and performance is
insensitive to mismatch. Further, we consider communication latency between
wafer and the conventional control computer system that is simulating the
environment. This latency increases the delay, with which the reward is sent to
the embedded processor. Because of the time continuous operation of the analog
synapses, delay can cause a deviation of the updates as compared to the not
delayed situation. We find that for highly accelerated systems latency has to
be kept to a minimum. This study demonstrates the suitability of the proposed
implementation to emulate the selected reward modulated STDP learning rule.

This is the first superconducting example by the substitution of S site, which

demonstrate the appearance of a series of electronic states in 1T-TaS2-xSex

within the NCCDW state, and finally commensurate charge-density-wave (CCDW)

with the total time T=20 yr, the pulsar noise level $\sigma_w=30$ns and the

much tighter than those inferred from the current results of Parkers Pulsar

studying the effects of various observational factors on the sensitivities of

D7-branes via the Ouyang embedding contributes to the supersymmetry-breaking

together give rise to a non-trivial D-term on the D7-branes. This
supersymmetry-breaking term vanishes when we take the singular conifold limit,
although supersymmetry appears to remain broken. We also lift our construction
to F-theory where we show that the type IIB (1,2) flux goes to (2,2)

non-extremal limit of our geometry to incorporate temperature. In this case,
the internal NS-NS and R-R fluxes are no longer expected to be self-dual, but
they should also naturally be extensions of the fluxes found above. From the
supergravity equations of motion, we compute how the new contributions to the

between a small body and a massive planet in an outer circular orbit is as high
as $\sim39.2^{\circ}$ for pumping the eccentricity of the inner small body.
Here we show that, with the presence of a residual gas disk outside two
planetary orbits, the inclination can be reduced as low as a few degrees. The
presence of disk changes the nodal precession rates and directions of the
planet orbits. At the place where the two planets achieve the same nodal
processing rate, vertical secular resonance would occur so that mutual
inclination of the two planets will be excited, which might trigger the Kozai
resonance between the two planets further. However, in order to pump an inner
Jupiter-like planet, the conditions required for the disk and the outer planet
are relatively strict. We develop a set of evolution equations, which can fit
the N-body simulation quite well but be integrated within a much shorter time.
By scanning the parameter spaces using the evolution equations, we find that, a
massive planet ($10M_J$) at 30AU with $6^o$ inclined to a massive disk
($50M_J$) can finally enter the Kozai resonance with an inner Jupiter around
the snowline. And a $20^{\circ}$ inclination of the outer planet is required
for flipping the inner one to a retrograde orbit. In multiple planet systems,
the mechanism can happen between two nonadjacent planets, or inspire a chain
reaction among more than two planets. This mechanism could be the source of the
observed giant planets in moderate eccentric and inclined orbits, or
hot-Jupiters in close-in, retrograde orbits after tidal damping.

mapping between codons and amino acids, and this flexibility allows modifying
the code artificially. But once fixed, the code might stay unchanged over
cosmological timescales. Thus, it represents a reliable storage for an

from being settled, the proposal that it might have been seeded intentionally
cannot be ruled out. A statistically strong signal in the genetic code is then
a testable consequence of such scenario. Here we show that the terrestrial code

embedding the signal into the code and possible interpretation of its content

of giant exoplanets, is commonly explained by the accretion of nebular hydrogen
and helium onto a large core of terrestrial-like composition. The fate of this
core has important consequences for the evolution of the interior structure of
the planet. It has recently been shown that H2O, MgO and SiO2 dissolve in
liquid metallic hydrogen at high temperature and pressure. In this study, we
perform ab initio calculations to study the solubility of an innermost metallic
core. We find dissolution of iron to be strongly favored above 2000 K over the
entire pressure range (0.4-4 TPa) considered. We compare with and summarize the
results for solubilities on other probable core constituents. The calculations
imply that giant planet cores are in thermodynamic disequilibrium with
surrounding layers, promoting erosion and redistribution of heavy elements.
Differences in solubility behavior between iron and rock may influence
evolution of interiors, particularly for Saturn-mass planets. Understanding the
distribution of iron and other heavy elements in gas giants may be relevant in
understanding mass-radius relationships, as well as deviations in transport
properties from pure hydrogen-helium mixtures.

Mass outflow is ubiquitous in this astrophysical context, and radiation
pressure is also important if the AGN is luminous. For the first time in this
subject, we incorporate both mass outflow feedback and radiative feedback into
our model. Consequently, the ISM is shocked into shells by the AGN feedback,
and these shells soon fragment into clumps and filaments because of
Rayleigh-Taylor and thermal instabilities. We have two major findings: (1) the
star formation rate can indeed be very large in the clumps and filaments.
However, the resultant star formation rate density is too large compared with
previous works, which is mainly because we ignore the fact that most of the
stars that are formed would be disrupted when they move away from the galactic
center. (2) Although radiation pressure feedback has a limited effect, when
mass outflow feedback is also included, they reinforce each other.
Specifically, in the gas-poor case, mass outflow is always the dominant
contributor to feedback.

radio reference frame with the Gaia optical reference frame using many common

the radio and optical positions of compact active galactic nuclei (AGN). Aims.
Using the best catalogues available at present, we investigate how many AGN
with significantly large optical-radio positional offsets exist as well as the
possible causes of these offsets. Methods. We performed a case study by finding
optical counterparts to the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF2)
radio sources in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 9 (DR9). The
ICRF2 catalogue was used as a reference because the radio positions determined
by Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations are about two orders
of magnitude more accurate than the optical positions. Results. We find 1297
objects in common for ICRF2 and SDSS DR9. Statistical analysis of the
optical-radio differences verifies that the SDSS DR9 positions are accurate to
~55 mas in both coordinates, with no systematic offset with respect to ICRF2.
We find 51 sources (~4% of the sample) for which the positional offset exceeds
170 mas (~3{\sigma}). Astrophysical explanations must exist for most of these
outliers. There are 3 known strong gravitational lenses among them. Dual AGN or
recoiling supermassive black holes may also be possible. Conclusions. The most
accurate Gaia-VLBI reference frame link will require a careful selection of a
common set of objects by eliminating the outliers. On the other hand, the
significant optical-radio positional non-coincidences may offer a new tool for
finding e.g. gravitational lenses or dual AGN candidates. Detailed follow-up
radio interferometric and optical spectroscopic observations are encouraged to
investigate the outlier sources found in this study.

varying channel qualities, it is important to allocate the limited transmission
power to channels that will be in good state. However, it is very challenging
to do so because channel states are usually unknown when the power allocation
decision is made. In this paper, we derive an optimal power allocation policy
that can maximize the expected discounted number of bits transmitted over an
infinite time span by allocating the transmission power only to those channels
that are believed to be good in the coming time slot. We use the concept belief
to represent the probability that a channel will be good and derive an optimal
power allocation policy that establishes a mapping from the channel belief to
an allocation decision.
  Specifically, we first model this problem as a partially observable Markov
decision processes (POMDP), and analytically investigate the structure of the
optimal policy. Then a simple threshold-based policy is derived for a
three-channel communication system. By formulating and solving a linear
programming formulation of this power allocation problem, we further verified
the derived structure of the optimal policy.

prime energy reservoir that fuels the dynamical evolution. In the solar
context, the free energy is one of the main indicators used in space weather
forecasts to predict the eruptivity of active regions. A trustworthy estimation
of the magnetic energy is therefore needed in three-dimensional models of the
solar atmosphere, eg in coronal fields reconstructions or numerical
simulations. The expression of the energy of a system as the sum of its
potential energy and its free energy (Thomson's theorem) is strictly valid when
the magnetic field is exactly solenoidal. For numerical realizations on a
discrete grid, this property may be only approximately fulfilled. We show that
the imperfect solenoidality induces terms in the energy that can lead to
misinterpreting the amount of free energy present in a magnetic configuration.
We consider a decomposition of the energy in solenoidal and nonsolenoidal parts
which allows the unambiguous estimation of the nonsolenoidal contribution to
the energy. We apply this decomposition to six typical cases broadly used in
solar physics. We quantify to what extent the Thomson theorem is not satisfied
when approximately solenoidal fields are used. The quantified errors on energy
vary from negligible to significant errors, depending on the extent of the
nonsolenoidal component. We identify the main source of errors and analyze the
implications of adding a variable amount of divergence to various solenoidal
fields. Finally, we present pathological unphysical situations where the
estimated free energy would appear to be negative, as found in some previous

data centers that are primarily energy consumers to also energy producers. We
focus on minimizing the operating costs of next-generation data centers that

cooling systems. We formulate the cost minimization problem and present an
offline optimal algorithm. For ""on-grid"" data centers that use only the grid,
we devise a deterministic online algorithm that achieves the best possible
competitive ratio of $2-\alpha_{s}$, where $\alpha_{s}$ is a normalized
look-ahead window size. For ""hybrid"" data centers that have on-site power

$\alpha_{g}$ are normalized look-ahead window sizes, $P_{\max}$ is the maximum
grid power price, and $L$, $c_{o}$, and $c_{m}$ are parameters of an on-site

  Using extensive workload traces from Akamai with the corresponding grid power
prices, we simulate our offline and online algorithms in a realistic setting.
Our offline (resp., online) algorithm achieves a cost reduction of 25.8%

data center. The cost reductions are quite significant and make a strong case
for a joint optimization of energy supply and energy demand in a data center. A
hybrid data center provides about 13% additional cost reduction over an on-grid
data center representing the additional cost benefits that on-site power
generation provides over using the grid alone.

interaction of a pulsar wind with that of a companion star. At the shock
between the outflows, particles carried away from the pulsar magnetosphere are
accelerated and radiate both in synchrotron and inverse Compton processes. This
emission constitutes a significant fraction of the pulsar spin-down luminosity.
It is not clear however, how the highly magnetized pulsar wind could convert
its mainly electromagnetic energy into the particles with such high efficiency.
Here we investigate a scenario in which a pulsar striped wind converts into a
strong electromagnetic wave before reaching the shock. This mode can be thought
of as a shock precursor that is able to accelerate particles to
ultrarelativistic energies at the expense of the electromagnetic energy it
carries. Radiation of the particles leads to damping of the wave. The
efficiency of this process depends on the physical conditions imposed by the
external medium. Two regimes can be distinguished: a high density one, where
the EM wave cannot be launched at all and the current sheets in the striped
wind are first compressed by an MHD shock and subsequently dissipate by
reconnection, and a low density one, where the wind can first convert into an
electromagnetic wave in the shock precursor, which then damps and merges into
the surroundings. Shocks in binary systems can transit from one regime to
another according to binary phase. We discuss possible observational
implications for these objects.

attention this mechanism received in the last 40 years, only a few studies
investigated the influence of the cellular environment on the facilitated
diffusion mechanism and, in particular, the influence of `other' DNA binding
proteins competing with the TF molecules for DNA space. Molecular crowding on
the DNA is likely to influence the association rate of TFs to their target site
and the steady state occupancy of those sites, but it is still not clear how it
influences the search in a genome-wide context, when the model includes
biologically relevant parameters (such as: TF abundance, TF affinity for DNA
and TF dynamics on the DNA). We performed stochastic simulations of TFs
performing the facilitated diffusion mechanism, and considered various
abundances of cognate and non-cognate TFs. We show that, for both obstacles
that move on the DNA and obstacles that are fixed on the DNA, changes in search
time are not statistically significant in case of biologically relevant
crowding levels on the DNA. In the case of non-cognate proteins that slide on
the DNA, molecular crowding on the DNA always leads to statistically
significant lower levels of occupancy, which may confer a general mechanism to
control gene activity levels globally. When the `other' molecules are immobile
on the DNA, we found a completely different behaviour, namely: the occupancy of
the target site is always increased by higher molecular crowding on the DNA.
Finally, we show that crowding on the DNA may increase transcriptional noise
through increased variability of the occupancy time of the target sites.

strategies used for the numerical simulation of time-dependent partial
differential equations. These methods keep the total number of mesh points
fixed during the simulation, but redistribute them over time to follow the
areas where a higher mesh point density is required. There are a very limited
number of moving mesh methods designed for solving field-theoretic partial
differential equations, and the numerical analysis of the resulting schemes is
challenging. In this paper we present two ways to construct r-adaptive
variational and multisymplectic integrators for (1+1)-dimensional Lagrangian
field theories. The first method uses a variational discretization of the
physical equations and the mesh equations are then coupled in a way typical of
the existing r-adaptive schemes. The second method treats the mesh points as
pseudo-particles and incorporates their dynamics directly into the variational
principle. A user-specified adaptation strategy is then enforced through
Lagrange multipliers as a constraint on the dynamics of both the physical field
and the mesh points. We discuss the advantages and limitations of our methods.
Numerical results for the Sine-Gordon equation are also presented.

$G(V,E)$ with its vertices colored with black and white, any black vertex $v$

color, i.e. white neighbors become black and \emph{vice versa}, (b) all pairs
of neighbors of $v$ change connectivity, i.e. connected pairs become
unconnected, unconnected ones become connected, (c) and finally, $v$ becomes a

reachable in the pressing game if each component of $G$ contains at least one

with an Earth-like biomass and planetary development. We investigated planets
with gravities of 1g and 3g and a surface pressure of one bar around central
stars with spectral classes from M0 to M7. The spectral signals of the

form and destroy biosignature species. Ozone is a potential biosignature for
complex- life. An important result of our analysis is a shift in the ozone
photochemistry from mainly Chapman production (which dominates in the
terrestrial stratosphere) to smog-dominated ozone production for planets in the
Habitable Zone of cooler (M5-M7)-class dwarf stars. This result is associated
with a lower energy flux in the UVB wavelength range from the central star,
hence slower planetary atmospheric photolysis of molecular oxygen, which slows
the Chapman ozone production.

derive the primary's effective temperature, surface gravity, bolometric
correction, and the luminosity. An analysis of a high signal-to-noise

this value is approximately equal to the mean density obtained from the star's

excited states lying above multi-hadron thresholds in lattice QCD Monte Carlo
calculations. The construction of multi-hadron operators with significant
coupling to the lowest-lying multi-hadron states of interest involves combining
single hadron operators of various momenta. The design and implementation of
large sets of spatially-extended single-hadron operators of definite momentum
and their combinations into two-hadron operators are described. The single
hadron operators are all assemblages of gauge-covariantly-displaced, smeared
quark fields. Group-theoretical projections onto the irreducible
representations of the symmetry group of a cubic spatial lattice are used in
all isospin channels. Tests of these operators on 24^3 x 128 and 32^3 x 256
anisotropic lattices using a stochastic method of treating the low-lying modes
of quark propagation which exploits Laplacian Heaviside quark-field smearing
are presented. The method provides reliable estimates of all needed
correlations, even those that are particularly difficult to compute, such as
eta eta -> eta eta in the scalar channel, which involves the subtraction of a
large vacuum expectation value. A new glueball operator is introduced, and the
evaluation of the mixing of this glueball operator with a quark-antiquark
operator, pi-pi, and eta-eta operators is shown to be feasible.

the facility was upgraded in 2004. Using an extended data analysis of data
primarily intended for measuring elastic neutron scattering only, it was found
to be possible to extract information on the inelastic scattering from several
nuclei. In the preliminary data analysis, an iterative forward-folding
technique was applied, in which a physically reasonable trial spectrum was
folded with the response function of the detector system and the output was
compared to the experimental data. As a result, double-differential cross
sections and angular distributions of inelastic neutron scattering from 12-C,
56-Fe, 89-Y and 208-Pb could be obtained. In this paper, a status update on the

during spontaneous symmetry breaking for quite different systems. Shortly after
the big bang, the isotropy of the Higgs-field is broken during the expansion
and cooling of the universe. Kibble proposed the formation of monopoles,
strings, and membranes in the Higgs field since the phase of the symmetry
broken field can not switch globally to gain the same value everywhere in
space. Zurek pointed out that the same mechanism is relevant for second order
phase transitions in condensed matter systems. Every finite cooling rate
induces the system to fall out of equilibrium which is due to the critical
slowing down of order parameter fluctuations: the correlation time diverges and
the symmetry of the system can not change globally but incorporates defects
between different domains. Depending on the cooling rate the heterogeneous
order parameter pattern are a fingerprint of critical fluctuations. In the
present manuscript we show that a monolayer of superparamagnetic colloidal
particles is ideally suited to investigate such phenomena. In thermal
equilibrium the system undergos continuous phase transitions according
KTHNY-theory. If cooled rapidly across the melting temperature the final state
is a polycrystal. We show, that the observations can not be explained with
nucleation of a supercooled fluid but is compatible with the Kibble-Zurek
mechanism.

  proceedings of the 2nd CO5BOLD Workshop (Heidelberg, 2012)",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the influence of convection on the asymmetries and Doppler shifts of
Fe I spectral lines in the metal-poor red giant HD 122563. To this end, we
compute theoretical Fe I line shifts and line bisectors using 3D hydrodynamical
model atmosphere of HD 122563 calculated with the CO5BOLD code. We then make a
detailed comparison of the theoretical line shifts and bisectors with those
derived from the high quality HARPS spectrum of HD 122563 taken from the ESO
Science Archive Facility (R = 115 000, average signal-to-noise ratio, S/N =
310). In general, we find a good agreement between the theoretically predicted
and observed Doppler shifts of Fe I line cores, with somewhat larger
discrepancies seen in the case of weaker (equivalent width W < 5 pm) and
stronger lines (W > 11 pm). Both observed and theoretical coreshifts cover a
range between 0 and -1 km/s, with increasingly stronger blueshifts for weaker
lines and slight hints of a coreshift dependence on wavelength. Theoretical
bisectors reproduce the observed ones reasonably well too, however, theoretical
bisectors of the weak red (lambda > 600 nm) Fe I lines have blueshifts that are
by up to 200 m/s larger than observed. The obtained results therefore suggest
that the current CO5BOLD models are capable of reproducing the large-scale
velocity fields in the atmosphere of HD 122563 suficiently well. Nevertheless,
further efforts are needed in order to understand the physical reasons behind
the discrepancies in theoretical predictions and observed properties of the
weakest and strongest Fe I lines.

Congestion Notification (ECN) field in the Internet Protocol (IP) header. It
allows the source to estimate the exact level of congestion at each
intermediate queue. By knowing this, the source could take avoiding action
either by adapting its sending rate or by using alternate routes. The
estimation mechanism makes use of time series analysis both to improve the
quality of the congestion estimation and to predict, ahead of time, the
congestion level which subsequent packets will encounter.
  The proposed protocol is tested in ns-2 simulator using a background of real
Internet traffic traces. Results show that the methods can successfully
calculate the congestion at any queue along the path with low error levels.

a low-cost Spartan-6 FPGA. Our design exploits the finite propagation speed in
carry chains to realize a delay line in which the propagation distance of the
incoming signal's edges is measured using hundreds of taps. This technique
enables the core to reach a precision far better than the minimum switching
period of the FPGA flip-flops. To compensate for process, voltage and
temperature (PVT) effects, our design uses a combination of two techniques:
startup calibration and online calibration. The startup calibration uses a
statistical method to estimate the delay between the taps of the delay line and
helps eliminate the effect of process variations. The online calibration, which
takes place without disruption of the core's operation, uses a ring oscillator
whose frequency instability is measured and used to compensate for subsequent
voltage and temperature effects on the delay line. Our tests show that our
design reaches a precision of 26 ps RMS over a temperature range of 37C to 48C.

this behaviour is inconsistent with the behaviour of real traffic traces.
Secondly, the notion that long-range correlations significantly affects the

performance in FPGA based TDC designs. However, it should be guaranteed in such
a structure that the non-thermometer code to binary code (NTH2B) encoding
process should be finished within just one system clock cycle. So the
implementation of the NTH2B encoder is quite challenging considering the high
speed requirement. Besides, the high resolution wave union TDC also demands the
encoder to convert an ultra-wide input code to a binary code. We present a fast
improved fat tree encoder (IFTE) to fulfill such requirements, in which bubble
error suppression is also integrated. With this encoder scheme, a wave union
TDC with 7.7 ps RMS and 3.8 ps effective bin size was implemented in an FPGA
from Xilinx Virtex 5 family. An encoding time of 8.33 ns was achieved for a
276-bit non-thermometer code to a 9-bit binary code conversion. We conducted a
series of tests on the oscillating period of the wave union launcher, as well
as the overall performance of the TDC; test results indicate that the IFTE
works well. In fact, in the implementation of this encoder, no manual routing
or special constrains were required; therefore, this IFTE structure could also
be further applied in other delay chain based FPGA TDCs.

observation allows us to conclude that the Kelvin-wave cascade is not important
in the energy dissipation process within the range alpha > 0.001. Rather, the
energy is directly transferred from Kelvin waves to the normal component.
Moreover, while the excited Kelvin waves greatly enhance energy dissipation, no
similar change is seen in angular momentum from the reconnection event. This
result has similarities with recent 3He-B measurements. Our results also
confirm another earlier observation that the minimum distance between vortices

systems. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a very well-known
technique for efficient data transmission over many carriers overlapped in
frequency. Recently, several papers have appeared which describe spectrally
efficient variations of multi-carrier systems where the condition of
orthogonality is dropped. Proposed techniques suffer from two weaknesses:
Firstly, the complexity of generating the signal is increased. Secondly, the
signal detection is computationally demanding. Known methods suffer either
unusably high complexity or high error rates because of the inter-carrier
interference. This work addresses both problems by proposing new transmitter
and receiver arch itectures whose design is based on using the simplification
that a rational Spectrally Efficient Frequency Division Multiplexing (SEFDM)
system can be treated as a set of overlapped and interleaving OFDM systems.
  The efficacy of the proposed designs is shown through detailed simulation of
sys tems with different signal types and carrier dimensions. The decoder is
heuristic but in practice produces very good results which are close to the
theoretical best performance in a variety of settings. The system is able to
produce efficiency gains of up to 20% with negligible impact on the required
signal to noise ratio.

The resonant peak in the device characteristics occurs when the electronic

conductance persists up to room temperature and is gate voltage-tuneable due to
graphene's unique Dirac-like spectrum. Whereas conventional resonant tunnelling
devices comprising a quantum well sandwiched between two tunnel barriers are
tens of nanometres thick, the tunnelling carriers in our devices cross only a
few atomic layers, offering the prospect of ultra-fast transit times. This

disk galaxies in the local universe. In this paper, we explore the multiphase
structure and power sources of galactic winds in six ultraluminous infrared
galaxies (ULIRGs) at z < 0.06 using deep integral field spectroscopy with the
Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) on Gemini North. We probe the neutral,
ionized, and dusty gas phases using Na I D, strong emission lines ([O I],
Halpha, and [N II]), and continuum colors, respectively. We separate outflow
motions from those due to rotation and tidal perturbations, and find that all
of the galaxies in our sample host high-velocity flows on kiloparsec scales.
The properties of these outflows are consistent with multiphase (ionized,
neutral, and dusty) collimated bipolar winds emerging along the minor axis of
the nuclear disk to scales of 1-2 kpc. In two cases, these collimated winds
take the form of bipolar superbubbles, identified by clear kinematic
signatures. Less collimated (but still high-velocity) flows are also present on
scales up to 5 kpc in most systems. The three galaxies in our sample with
obscured QSOs host higher velocity outflows than those in the three galaxies
with no evidence for an AGN. The peak outflow velocity in each of the QSOs is
in the range 1450-3350 km/s, and the highest velocities (2000-3000 km/s) are
seen only in ionized gas. The outflow energy and momentum in the QSOs are
difficult to produce from a starburst alone, but are consistent with the QSO
contributing significantly to the driving of the flow. Finally, when all gas
phases are accounted for, the outflows are massive enough to provide negative
feedback to star formation.

stress/strain relation generalized by fractional calculus modelling. This is a

Scenario-based reasoning, involves the generation of alternative causal

representing independencies in a joint probability distribution. The exact
methods and the approximation methods, which perform probabilistic inference in
causal networks, often treat the conditional probabilities which are stored in
the network as certain values. However, if one takes either a subjectivistic or
a limiting frequency approach to probability, one can never be certain of
probability values. An algorithm for probabilistic inference should not only be
capable of reporting the inferred probabilities; it should also be capable of
reporting the uncertainty in these probabilities relative to the uncertainty in
the probabilities which are stored in the network. In section 2 of this paper a
method is given for determining the prior variances of the probabilities of all
the nodes. Section 3 contains an approximation method for determining the
variances in inferred probabilities.

design. Systems based on Bayes nets require two types of information--network

more time is spent in their refinement than in any other phase of elicitation.
Thus, it is important to determine the point of diminishing returns, beyond
which further refinements will promise little (if any) improvement. Sensitivity
analyses address precisely this issue--the sensitivity of a model to the
precision of its parameters. In this paper, we report the results of a
sensitivity analysis of Pathfinder, a Bayes net based system for diagnosing
pathologies of the lymph system. This analysis is intended to shed some light

possibilistic structures and concepts by means of a function that quantifies
proximity, closeness, or resemblance between pairs of possible worlds. The
resulting model is a natural extension, based on multiple conceivability
relations, of the modal logic concepts of necessity and possibility. By
contrast, chance-oriented probabilistic concepts and structures rely on
measures of set extension that quantify the proportion of possible worlds where
a proposition is true. Resemblance between possible worlds is quantified by a
generalized similarity relation: a function that assigns a number between O and
1 to every pair of possible worlds. Using this similarity relation, which is a
form of numerical complement of a classic metric or distance, it is possible to
define and interpret the major constructs and methods of fuzzy logic:
conditional and unconditioned possibility and necessity distributions and the

is the rule of combination for updating the degrees of uncertainty. The theory
of belief functions uses the Dempster rule to combine two belief functions
defined by independent bodies of evidence. However, with limited dependency
information about the accumulated belief the Dempster rule may lead to
unsatisfactory results. The present study suggests a method to determine the
accumulated belief based on the premise that the information gain from the
combination process should be minimum. This method provides a mechanism that is
equivalent to the Bayes rule when all the conditional probabilities are
available and to the Dempster rule when the normalization constant is equal to
one. The proposed principle of minimum information gain is shown to be
equivalent to the maximum entropy formalism, a special case of the principle of
minimum cross-entropy. The application of this principle results in a monotonic
increase in belief with accumulation of consistent evidence. The suggested
approach may provide a more reasonable criterion for identifying conflicts
among various bodies of evidence.

differentiable functions is one of the core questions in convex optimization.
This paper shows that their well-known complexities can be achieved under
conditions weaker than the commonly accepted ones. We relax the common gradient
Lipschitz-continuity condition and strong convexity condition to ones that hold
only over certain line segments. Specifically, we establish complexities
$O(\frac{R}{\epsilon})$ and $O(\sqrt{\frac{R}{\epsilon}})$ for the ordinary and
accelerate gradient methods, respectively, assuming that $\nabla f$ is
Lipschitz continuous with constant $R$ over the line segment joining $x$ and
$x-\frac{1}{R}\nabla f$ for each $x\in\dom f$. Then we improve them to
$O(\frac{R}{\nu}\log(\frac{1}{\epsilon}))$ and
$O(\sqrt{\frac{R}{\nu}}\log(\frac{1}{\epsilon}))$ for function $f$ that also
satisfies the secant inequality $\ < \nabla f(x), x- x^*\ > \ge \nu\|x-x^*\|^2$
for each $x\in \dom f$ and its projection $x^*$ to the minimizer set of $f$.
The secant condition is also shown to be necessary for the geometric decay of
solution error. Not only are the relaxed conditions met by more functions, the
restrictions give smaller $R$ and larger $\nu$ than they are without the
restrictions and thus lead to better complexity bounds. We apply these results
to sparse optimization and demonstrate a faster algorithm.

Dirac fermions in one and three spatial dimensions, Dirac fields and briefly
the Thirring model. Finally, we show that the dynamics of causal fermions in

cosmological models where the equation of state of dark energy and the
curvature are allowed to vary. We find that the consistency of results from
short baseline experiments and cosmology is dependent on the cosmological data
sets that are used. When the two are consistent, we find that the inclusion of
information from short baseline experiments only mildly affects the preferred
values of the cosmological model parameters. A universe with a cosmological
constant type dark energy and zero curvature is still fully consistent with the

by Casey et al.[1], displayed an anomalously low dd proton yield and a high tt
neutron yield as compared to dt fusion reactions, explained as a stratification
of the fuel in the implosion core. We suggest that in the com- pression stage
the fuel is out of equilibrium. Ions are inward accelerated to a velocity v0
independent on the particle type. Yield ratios are simply given by the ratios
of fusion cross-sections obtained at the same velocity. A 'Hubble' type model
gives also a reasonable description of the data. These considerations might be
relevant for implosion experiments at the National Ignition Facility as well.

hadronic resonances, respectively, within simple quantum mechanical and quantum
field theoretical (effective) models.
  We start with the basic ideas of quantum field theory. In particular, we
introduce the Feynman propagator for unstable scalar resonances and motivate
the idea that this kind of correlation function should possess complex poles
which parameterize the mass and decay width of the considered particle. We also
briefly discuss the problematic scalar sector in particle physics, emphasizing
that hadronic loop contributions dominate its dynamics. A whole chapter is
dedicated to the method of analytic continuation of complex functions through
branch cuts into the so called second Riemann sheet. This method is crucial in
order to describe physics of scalar resonances because the Feynman propagator
of interacting quantum field theories will have branch cuts in the complex
energy plane and complex poles in the second Riemann sheet.
  We then apply these concepts to a simple non-relativistic Lee model and
demonstrate the physical implications, i.e., the motion of the propagator poles
and the behaviour of the spectral function. Besides that, we investigate the
time evolution of a particle described by such a model.
  In the last chapter, we finally concentrate on a simple quantum field
theoretical model which describes the decay of a scalar state into two
(pseudo)scalar ones. It is investigated how the motion of the propagator poles
is influenced by loop contributions of the two (pseudo)scalar particles. We
perform a numerical study for a hadronic system involving a scalar seed state
(alias the \sigma-meson) that couples to pions. The unexpected emergence of a
putative stable state below the two-pion threshold is investigated and it is
clarified under which conditions such a stable state appears.

observable-independent total given by the quantum mutual information. This
split naturally delineates information about quantum systems accessible to
observers -- information that is redundantly transmitted by the environment --
while showing that it is maximized for the quasi-classical pointer observable.
Other observables are accessible only via correlations with the pointer
observable. Further, we prove an anti-symmetry property relating accessible
information and discord. It shows that information becomes objective --
accessible to many observers -- only as quantum information is relegated to
correlations with the global environment, and, therefore, locally inaccessible.
The resulting complementarity explains why, in a quantum Universe, we perceive
objective classical reality while flagrantly quantum superpositions are out of
reach.

this end, we first develop a characterization of sh Lie-Rinehart algebras in
terms of differential graded cocommutative coalgebras and Lie algebra twisting

higher brackets but reproduces these brackets in a conceptual manner. The new
technical tool we develop is a notion of filtered multi derivation chain

endowed with a compatible algebra structure. The crucial observation, just as
for ordinary Lie-Rinehart algebras, is this: For a general sh Lie-Rinehart
algebra,the generalized Cartan-Chevalley-Eilenberg operator on the
corresponding graded algebra involves two operators, one coming from the sh Lie
algebra structure and the other from the generalized action on the
corresponding algebra; the sum of the operators is defined on the algebra while
the operators are individually defined only on a larger ambient algebra. We
illustrate the structure with quasi Lie-Rinehart algebras.

with changes in parameters. The motion of the spots in the azimuthal direction

unitarity it is possible to obtain an observable asymmetry in the survival

asymmetries in vacuum of the order of 2% and 4% for the $\nu_\mu \to \nu_e$ and

fundamental stellar parameters (FSPs), one of which is the initial mass
fraction of helium (Y). However, given that Y can be measured spectroscopically
in only a small percentage of stars, a linear relationship is assumed between Y
and the mass fraction of metals (Z). This Y-Z relation is generally represented
as Y=Yp+DY/DZxZ, with the value of the helium-to-metal enrichment ratio (DY/DZ)
assumed as a constant. However, there is no fundamental reason for every star
to have a Y value on a linear scale with Z. In this paper a method for
determining the FSPs of nearby stars is presented that uses at the same time
Mbol, Teff, and log g. One of these parameters is Y, which is used to determine
the validity of the Y-Z relation. A new set of evolutionary tracks is created
using the PGPUC stellar evolution code, which includes 7 masses
(0.5<M/Msun<1.1), 7 helium abundances (0.230<Y<0.370), and 12 metallicities
(1.6x10^-4<Z<6.0x10^-2) for solar-scaled chemical compositions
([alpha/Fe]=0.0). The suggested method is tested using two different
spectroscopic databases of nearby main sequence stars with precise parallaxes,
and spectroscopic measurements of [Fe/H], Teff and g. The proposed method is
compared to other techniques used to determine the FSPs, where one assumes an
age of 5 Gyr for all nearby stars. This comparison demonstrates that the
hypothesis regarding constant age leads to an underestimation of the Y value,
especially for low metallicities. In addition, the suggested method is limited
to masses above 0.60 Msun and requires high-precision measurements of
spectroscopic surface gravities in order to obtain reliable results. Finally,
estimating masses and ages assuming a Y-Z relation rather than a free Y value
may induce average errors of approximately 0.02 Msun and 2 Gyr, respectively.

classical and quantum information theory. Entanglement is one of these
resources, arising when quantum communication and nonlocal operations are
expensive to perform. In the first part of this thesis we quantify the
effective entanglement when operations are additionally restricted. For an
important class of errors we find a linear relationship between the usual and
effective higher dimensional generalization of concurrence, a measure of
entanglement.
  In the second chapter we focus on nonlocality in the presence of
superselection rules, where we propose a scheme that may be used to activate
nongenuinely multipartite nonlocality with multiple copies of the state. We
show that whenever the number of particles is insufficient, the genuinely
multipartite nonlocality is degraded to nongenuinely multipartite.
  While in the first few chapters we focus on understanding the resources
present in quantum states, in the final part we turn the picture around and
instead treat operations themselves as a resource. We provide our observers
with free access to classical operations - ie. those that cannot detect or
generate quantum coherence. We show that the operation of interest can then be
used to either generate or detect quantum coherence if and only if it violates
a particular commutation relation. Using the relative entropy, the commutation
relation provides us with a measure of nonclassicality of operations. We show
that the measure is a sum of two contributions, the generating power and the
distinguishing power, each of which is separately an essential ingredient in
quantum communication and information processing. The measure also sheds light
on the operational meaning of quantum discord, which we show can be interpreted
as the difference in superdense coding capacity between a quantum state and a

have focused on discovering communities of nodes, while recent studies have
shown great advantages and utilities of the knowledge of communities of links
in networks. From this new perspective, we propose a link dynamics based
algorithm, called UELC, for identifying link communities of networks. In UELC,
the stochastic process of a link-node-link random walk is employed to unfold an
embedded bipartition structure of links in a network. The local mixing
properties of the Markov chain underlying the random walk are then utilized to
extract two emerged link communities. Further, the random walk and the
bipartitioning processes are wrapped in an iterative subdivision strategy to
recursively identify link partitions that segregate the network links into
multiple subdivisions. We evaluate the performance of the new method on
synthetic benchmarks and demonstrate its utility on real-world networks. Our
experimental results show that our method is highly effective for discovering
link communities in complex networks. As a comparison, we also extend UELC to
extracting communities of node, and show that it is effective for node
community identification.

dynamics of curvature perturbations during inflation, as long as the
inflationary trajectory becomes non-geodesic in the multi-field target space
(the landscape). If fields orthogonal to the inflationary trajectory are
sufficiently heavy, one expects a reliable effective field theory describing
the low energy dynamics of curvature perturbations, with self-interactions
determined by the shape of the inflationary trajectory. Previous work analyzing
the role of heavy-fields during inflation have mostly focused in the effects on
curvature perturbations due to a single heavy-field. In this article we extend
the results of these works by studying models of inflation in which curvature
perturbations interact with two heavy-fields. We show that the second
heavy-field (orthogonal to both tangent and normal directions of the
inflationary trajectory) may significantly affect the evolution of curvature
modes. We compute the effective field theory for the low energy curvature
perturbations obtained by integrating out the two heavy-fields and show that
the presence of the second heavy-field implies the existence of additional
self-interactions not accounted for in the single heavy-field case. We conclude
that future observations will be able to constrain the number of heavy fields
interacting with curvature perturbations.

Despite the long history and importance in magnetic sensing and memory

beyond the basic notion of a relativistic magnetotransport phenomenon arising
from combined effects on diffusing carriers of spin-orbit coupling and broken

the ohmic AMR effect in a nano-scale film of an antiferromagnetic (AFM)

integrating semiconducting and spintronic technologies in AFMs. SIO is a
particularly favorable material for exploring this path since its
semiconducting nature is entangled with the AFM order and strong spin-orbit
coupling. For the observation of the low-field Ohmic AMR in SIO we prepared an
epitaxial heterostructure comprising a nano-scale SIO film on top of an
epilayer of a FM metal La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 (LSMO). This allows the magnetic field
control of the orientation of AFM spins in SIO via the exchange spring effect

function are examined. In particular, the r^1/4 law performs well in the middle
regions, but is inadequate for the core (inner 5 kpcs) and the outer regions
(beyond the half-light radius) which do not have r^1/4 shapes. It is found that
the Sersic r^1/n model produce good fits to the core regions of ellipticals (r
< r_half), but is an inadequate function for the entire profile of an
elliptical from core to halo due to competing effects on the Sersic n index and
the fact that the interior shape of an elliptical is only weakly correlated
with its halo shape. In addition, there are a wide range of Sersic parameters
that will equally describe the shape of the outer profile, degrading the Sersic
models usefulness as a describer of the entire profile. Empirically determined
parameters, such as half-light radius and total luminosity, have less scatter

often non-linear, but for ellipticals brighter than M_J < -23 the following

for ant diffusion in networks. Once the communities are found by SABA, this
method can be reapplied to a higher level network where each obtained community
is regarded as a new vertex. The aforementioned process is repeated
iteratively, and this corresponds to MABA. Thanks to the intrinsic multi-level
nature of our algorithm, it possesses the potential ability to unfold
multi-scale hierarchical structures. Furthermore, MABA has the ability that
mitigates the resolution limit of modularity. The proposed MABA has been
evaluated on both computer-generated benchmarks and widely used real-world
networks, and has been compared with a set of competitive algorithms.
Experimental results demonstrate that MABA is both effective and efficient (in
near linear time with respect to the size of network) for discovering
communities.

functions are defined by the way in which they vanish as several coordinates
approach the same value, or by a projection-operator Hamiltonian that enforces
those conditions. In a third way, functions are given by conformal blocks from
a conformal field theory (CFT). These different spaces of functions are closely
related. The use of CFT methods permits an algebraic formulation to be given
for all of them. In some cases, we can prove that there is a ground state, a
Hamiltonian, and a CFT such that, for any number of particles, all of these
spaces are the same. For such cases, this resolves several questions and
conjectures: it gives a finite-size bulk-edge correspondence, and we can use
the analysis of functions to construct a projection-operator Hamiltonian that
produces those functions as zero-energy states. For a model related to the N=1
superconformal algebra, the corresponding Hamiltonian imposes vanishing
properties involving only three particles; for this we determine all the
wavefunctions explicitly. We do the same for a sequence of models involving the

remove foregrounds and implementing two masking criteria based on the ROSAT and

We find that Planck can detect the tSZ power spectrum with >30-sigma
significance, regardless of the masking scenario. However, neither Planck or
PIXIE is likely to provide competitive constraints on fNL from the tSZ power
spectrum due to CV noise at low-ell overwhelming the unique signature of the
scale-dependent bias. A future CV-limited experiment could provide a 3-sigma
detection of fNL~37, which is the WMAP9 maximum-likelihood result. The outlook
for neutrino masses is more optimistic: Planck can reach levels comparable to
the current upper bounds ~<0.3 eV with conservative assumptions about the
intracluster medium (ICM); stronger ICM priors could allow Planck to provide
1-2-sigma evidence for massive neutrinos from the tSZ power spectrum, depending
on the true value of the sum of the neutrino masses. We also forecast a ~<10%

not totally dismissed. In parallel to the debate over their statistical
significance, recent work focussed on masks and secondary anisotropies as
potential sources of these anomalies. In this work we investigate
simultaneously the impact of the method used to account for masked regions and
the impact of the ISW effect, which is the large-scale secondary anisotropy
most likely to affect the CMB anomalies. In this sense, our work is an update
of both Francis & Peacock 2010 and Kim et al. 2012. Our aim is to identify
trends in CMB data with different mask treatments. We reconstruct the ISW
signal due to 2MASS and NVSS galaxies. We account for missing data using the
sparse inpainting technique of Abrial et al. 2008 and sparse inpainting of the
CMB, LSS and ISW and find that it constitutes a bias-free reconstruction method
suitable to study large-scale statistical isotropy and the ISW effect. We focus
on three large-scale CMB anomalies: the low quadrupole, the quad/oct alignment,
and the octopole planarity. After sparse inpainting, the low quadrupole becomes
more anomalous, whilst the quad/oct alignment becomes less anomalous. The
significance of the low quadrupole is unchanged after subtraction of the ISW
effect, while the trend is that the quad/oct alignment has reduced
significance, yet other hypotheses remain possible as well (e.g. exotic
physics). Our results also suggest that both of these anomalies may be due to
the quadrupole alone. The octopole planarity significance is also reduced after
inpainting and after ISW subtraction, however, we do not find that it was very
anomalous to start with. In the spirit of reproducible research, we make all

result we resort to the technique of comparison with standard dark energy
models. Here the RSII brane model have been considered as the gravity theory.
An interacting model is considered in order to search for a possible solution
of the cosmic coincidence problem. A dynamical system analysis is performed
because of the high complexity of the system . The statefinder parameters are
also calculated to classify the dark energy model. Graphs and phase diagrams
are drawn to study the variations of these parameters and get an insight into
the effectiveness of the dark energy model. It is also seen that the background
dynamics of New Variable Modified Chaplygin gas is consistent with the late
cosmic acceleration. After performing an extensive mathematical analysis, we
are able to constrain the parameters of new variable modified Chaplygin gas as
$m<n$ to produce the best possible results. Future singularities are studied
and it is found that the model has a tendency to result in such singularities
unlike the case of generalized cosmic Chaplygin gas. Our investigation leads us
to the fact that New Variable Modified Chaplygin gas is not as effective as

fields along the major and minor axes at projected elliptical radii of ~30-85
kpc (corresponding to ~5-14 R_{eff}). We use resolved star counts to map the
spatial and colour distribution of red giant branch (RGB) stars down to ~2
magnitudes below the RGB tip. We detect an extended halo out to the furthermost
elliptical radius probed (~85 kpc or ~14 R_{eff}), demonstrating the vast
extent of this system. We detect a localised substructure in these parts,
visible in both (old) RGB and (intermediate-age) luminous asymptotic giant
branch stars, and there is some evidence that the outer halo becomes more
elliptical and has a shallower surface brightness profile. We derive
photometric metallicity distribution functions for halo RGB stars and find
relatively high median metallicity values ([Fe/H]_{med} -0.9 to -1.0 dex) that
change very little with radius over the extent of our survey. Radial
metallicity gradients are measured to be ~-0.002 to -0.004 dex/kpc and the

region dynamics are dominated by the expansion of stellar wind bubbles, and
have neglected the contribution of radiation pressure to the dynamics, and in
some cases also to the internal structure. However, recent observations of
nearby galaxies suggest that neither assumption is justified, motivating us to
revisit the question of how HII region line emission depends on the physics of
winds and radiation pressure. In a companion paper we construct models of
single HII regions including and excluding radiation pressure and winds, and in
this paper we describe a population synthesis code that uses these models to
simulate galactic collections of HII regions with varying physical parameters.
We show that the choice of physical parameters has significant effects on
galactic emission line ratios, and that in some cases the line ratios can
exceed previously claimed theoretical limits. Our results suggest that the
recently-reported offset in line ratio values between high-redshift
star-forming galaxies and those in the local universe may be partially
explained by the presence of large numbers of radiation pressured-dominated HII
regions within them.

cases are produced by planets and/or substellar companions in these systems.
For this reason, these disks are extremely important for the study of planetary
system formation. The Herschel Space Observatory provides an unique opportunity
for studying the outer regions of protoplanetary disks. In this work we update
previous knowledge on the transitional disks in the Chamaeleon I and II regions
with data from the Herschel Gould Belt Survey. We propose a new method for
transitional disk classification based on the WISE 12 micron-PACS 70 micron
color, together with inspection of the Herschel images. We applied this method
to the population of Class II sources in the Chamaeleon region and studied the
spectral energy distributions of the transitional disks in the sample. We also
built the median spectral energy distribution of Class II objects in these
regions for comparison with transitional disks. The proposed method allows a
clear separation of the known transitional disks from the Class II sources. We
find 6 transitional disks, all previously known, and identify 5 objects
previously thought to be transitional as possibly non-transitional. We find
higher fluxes at the PACS wavelengths in the sample of transitional disks than
those of Class II objects. We show the Herschel 70 micron band to be an
efficient tool for transitional disk identification. The sensitivity and
spatial resolution of Herschel reveals a significant contamination level among
the previously identified transitional disk candidates for the two regions,
which calls for a revision of previous samples of transitional disks in other
regions. The systematic excess found at the PACS bands could be a result of the
mechanism that produces the transitional phase, or an indication of different
evolutionary paths for transitional disks and Class II sources.

powerful cosmological probe to shed new light on Dark Matter, Dark Energy and
Modified Gravity. It is based on the weak distortions induced by large-scale
structures on the observed shapes of distant galaxies through gravitational
lensing. While the potentials of this purely gravitational effect are great,
results from this technique have been hampered because the measurement of this
weak effect is difficult and limited by systematics effects. In particular, a
demanding step is the measurement of the weak lensing shear from wide field CCD
images of galaxies. We describe the origin of the problem and propose a way
forward for cosmic shear. Our proposed approach is based on Monte-Carlo Control
Loops and draws upon methods widely used in particle physics and engineering.
We describe the control loop scheme and show how it provides a calibration
method based on fast image simulations tuned to reproduce the statistical
properties of a specific cosmic shear data set. Through a series of iterative
loops and diagnostic tests, the Monte Carlo image simulations are made robust
to perturbations on modeling input parameters and thus to systematic effects.
We discuss how this approach can make the problem tractable and unleash to full

interpretation of these diagnostics requires calculations of the internal
structure of the emitting HII regions, and these calculations depend on the
assumptions one makes about the relative importance of radiation pressure and
stellar winds. In this paper we construct a grid of quasi-static HII region
models to explore how choices about these parameters alter HII regions'
emission line ratios. We find that, when radiation pressure is included in our
models, HII regions reach a saturation point beyond which further increases in
the luminosity of the driving stars does not produce any further increase in
effective ionization parameter, and thus does not yield any further alteration
in an HII region's line ratio. We also show that, if stellar winds are assumed
to be strong, the maximum possible ionization parameter is quite low. As a
result of this effect, it is inconsistent to simultaneously assume that HII
regions are wind-blown bubbles and that they have high ionization parameters;
some popular HII region models suffer from this inconsistency. Our work in this
paper provides a foundation for a companion paper in which we embed the model
grids we compute here within a population synthesis code that enables us to
compute the integrated line emission from galactic populations of HII regions.

therefore expected that our inferences hold for the general population of
gamma-ray bursts. Our main result is that the optical/near-infrared extinction
of gamma-ray burst afterglows in our sample does not follow a single
distribution. 87% of the events are absorbed by less than 2 mag, and 50% suffer
from less than 0.3-0.4 mag extinction. The remaining 13% of the afterglows are
highly absorbed. The true percentage of gamma-ray burst afterglows showing high
absorption could be even higher since a fair fraction of the events without
reliable redshift measurement are probably part of this class. These events may
be due to highly dusty molecular clouds/star forming regions associated with
the gamma-ray burst progenitor or along the afterglow line of sight, and/or to
massive dusty host galaxies. No clear evolution in the dust extinction
properties is evident within the redshift range of our sample, although the
largest extinctions are at z~1.5-2, close to the expected peak of the star
formation rate. Those events classified as dark are characterized, on average,
by a higher extinction than typical events in the sample. A correlation between
optical/near-infrared extinction and hydrogen-equivalent column density based
on X-ray studies is shown although the observed NH appears to be well in excess
compared to those observed in the Local Group. Dust extinction does not seem to
correlate with GRB energetics or luminosity.

completely positive, trace preserving semigroups of linear maps. The generators
of such evolutions are called Lindbladians. In the setting of quantum many-body
systems on a lattice it is natural to consider Lindbladians that decompose into
a sum of local interactions with decreasing strength with respect to the size
of their support. For both practical and theoretical reasons, it is crucial to
estimate the impact that perturbations in the generating Lindbladian, arising
as noise or errors, can have on the evolution. These local perturbations are
potentially unbounded, but constrained to respect the underlying lattice
structure. We show that even for polynomially decaying errors in the
Lindbladian, local observables and correlation functions are stable if the
unperturbed Lindbladian has a unique fixed point and a mixing time which scales
logarithmically with the system size. The proof relies on Lieb-Robinson bounds,
which describe a finite group velocity for propagation of information in local
systems. As a main example, we prove that classical Glauber dynamics is stable
under local perturbations, including perturbations in the transition rates
which may not preserve detailed balance.

We investigate the possibility that cosmic-ray (CR) streaming in the
intra-cluster medium can 'switch off' hadronically induced radio and gamma-ray
emission. For self-confined CRs, this depends on the source of MHD wave
damping: if only non-linear Landau damping operates, then CRs stream on the
slow Alfvenic timescale, but if turbulent wave damping operates, super-Alfvenic
streaming is possible. As turbulence increases, it promotes outward streaming
more than it enables inward turbulent advection. Curiously, the CR flux is
independent of $\nabla f$ (as long as it is non-zero) and depends only on
plasma parameters; this enables radio halos with flat inferred CR profiles to
turn off. We perform 1D time-dependent calculations of a radio mini-halo
(Perseus) and giant radio halo (Coma) and find that both diminish in radio
luminosity by an order of magnitude in several hundred Myr, given plausible
estimates for the magnetic field in the outskirts of the cluster. Due to the
energy dependence of CR streaming, spectral curvature develops, and radio halos
turn off more slowly at low frequencies -- properties consistent with
observations. Similarly, CR streaming rapidly turns off gamma-ray emission at
the high-energies probed by Cherenkov telescopes, but not at the low energies
probed by Fermi. CR mediated wave-heating of the ICM is unaffected, as it is
dominated by ~GeV CRs which stream Alfvenically.

This is particularly true at the large strain magnitudes ($>$4%) which

energy on strain, with tensile strain lowering the formation energy consistent
with the increasing molar volume with increasing oxygen deficiency. In

cooling function introduced by Koyama & Inutsuka (2002) and used by a number of
converging flow studies with the results of the detailed calculation of the
non-equilibrium chemistry and thermal balance of the gas. We find that a number
of the cloud properties, such as the mass and volume filling fractions of cold
gas, are relatively insensitive to the choice of cooling function. On the other
hand, the cloud morphology and the large-scale velocity distribution of the gas
do strongly depend on the cooling function. We show that the differences that
we see can largely be explained by differences in the way that Lyman-alpha
cooling is treated in the two complementary approaches, and that a proper
non-equilibrium treatment of the ionisation and recombination of the gas is
necessary in order to model the high-temperature cooling correctly.
  We also investigate the properties of the dense clumps formed within the
cloud. In agreement with previous models, we find that the majority of these
clumps are not self-gravitating, suggesting that some form of large-scale
collapse of the cloud may be required in order to produce gravitationally
unstable clumps and hence stars. Overall, the physical properties of the dense
clumps are similar in both simulations, suggesting that they do not depend
strongly on the choice of cooling function. However, we do find a systematic
difference of around 10K in the mean temperatures of the clumps produced by the

called the concentration or precision matrix, in Gaussian graphical models.
Traditional centralized estimation often requires global inference of the
covariance matrix, which can be computationally intensive in large dimensions.
Approximate inference based on message-passing algorithms, on the other hand,
can lead to unstable and biased estimation in loopy graphical models. In this
paper, we propose a general framework for distributed estimation based on a
maximum marginal likelihood (MML) approach. This approach computes local
parameter estimates by maximizing marginal likelihoods defined with respect to
data collected from local neighborhoods. Due to the non-convexity of the MML
problem, we introduce and solve a convex relaxation. The local estimates are
then combined into a global estimate without the need for iterative
message-passing between neighborhoods. The proposed algorithm is naturally
parallelizable and computationally efficient, thereby making it suitable for
high-dimensional problems. In the classical regime where the number of
variables $p$ is fixed and the number of samples $T$ increases to infinity, the
proposed estimator is shown to be asymptotically consistent and to improve
monotonically as the local neighborhood size increases. In the high-dimensional
scaling regime where both $p$ and $T$ increase to infinity, the convergence
rate to the true parameters is derived and is seen to be comparable to
centralized maximum likelihood estimation. Extensive numerical experiments
demonstrate the improved performance of the two-hop version of the proposed
estimator, which suffices to almost close the gap to the centralized maximum
likelihood estimator at a reduced computational cost.

the well-studied K giant Aldebaran with AMBER at the Very Large Telescope
Interferometer (VLTI). Our aim is to spatially resolve the outer atmosphere
(so-called MOLsphere) in individual CO first overtone lines and derive its
physical properties, which are important for understanding the mass-loss
mechanism in normal (i.e., non-Mira) K--M giants. Methods: Aldebaran was
observed between 2.28 and 2.31 micron with a projected baseline length of 10.4m
and a spectral resolution of 12000. Results: The uniform-disk diameter observed
in the CO first overtone lines is 20--35% larger than is measured in the
continuum. We have also detected a signature of inhomogeneities in the
CO-line-forming region on a spatial scale of ~45 mas, which is more than twice
as large as the angular diameter of the star itself. While the MARCS
photospheric model reproduces the observed spectrum well, the angular size in
the CO lines predicted by the MARCS model is significantly smaller than
observed. This is because the MARCS model with the parameters of Aldebaran has
a geometrical extension of only ~2% (with respect to the stellar radius). The
observed spectrum and interferometric data in the CO lines can be
simultaneously reproduced by placing an additional CO layer above the MARCS
photosphere. This CO layer is extended to 2.5 +/- 0.3 stellar radii with CO
column densities of 5x10^{19}--2x10^{20} cm^-2 and a temperature of 1500 +/-
200 K. Conclusions: The high spectral resolution of AMBER has enabled us to
spatially resolve the inhomogeneous, extended outer atmosphere (MOLsphere) in
the individual CO lines for the first time in a K giant. Our modeling of the
MOLsphere of Aldebaran suggests a rather small gradient in the temperature
distribution above the photosphere up to 2--3 stellar radii.

models for collections of high-dimensional data. To learn a union of subspaces
from a collection of data, sets of signals in the collection that belong to the
same subspace must be identified in order to obtain accurate estimates of the
subspace structures present in the data. Recently, sparse recovery methods have
been shown to provide a provable and robust strategy for exact feature
selection (EFS)--recovering subsets of points from the ensemble that live in
the same subspace. In parallel with recent studies of EFS with L1-minimization,
in this paper, we develop sufficient conditions for EFS with a greedy method
for sparse signal recovery known as orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP).
Following our analysis, we provide an empirical study of feature selection
strategies for signals living on unions of subspaces and characterize the gap
between sparse recovery methods and nearest neighbor (NN)-based approaches. In
particular, we demonstrate that sparse recovery methods provide significant
advantages over NN methods and the gap between the two approaches is
particularly pronounced when the sampling of subspaces in the dataset is
sparse. Our results suggest that OMP may be employed to reliably recover exact
feature sets in a number of regimes where NN approaches fail to reveal the
subspace membership of points in the ensemble.

  We prove that $X$ and $Y$ are $G$-biholomorphic if $X$ is $K$-contractible,

the course of several dozens of minutes. Here, we report experiments that
reveal an even faster mechanism which remarkably closes wounds by more than 50%
within the first 30 seconds. Circular and elliptical wounds (~100 um in size)
were made in the blastoderm of early chick embryos and allowed to heal, with
wound area and shape characterized as functions of time. The closure rate
displayed a biphasic behavior, with rapid constriction lasting about a minute,
followed by a period of more gradual closure to complete healing. Fluorescent
staining suggests that both healing phases are driven by actomyosin
contraction, with relatively rapid contraction of fibers at cell borders within
a relatively thick ring of tissue (several cells wide) around the wound
followed by slower contraction of a thin supracellular actomyosin ring along
the margin, consistent with a purse string mechanism. Finite-element modeling
showed that this idea is biophysically plausible, with relatively isotropic
contraction within the thick ring giving way to tangential contraction in the
thin ring. In addition, consistent with experimental results, simulated
elliptical wounds heal with little change in aspect ratio, and decreased
membrane tension can cause these wounds to open briefly before going on to
heal. These results provide new insight into the healing mechanism in embryonic
epithelia.

Universe is a rare statistical fluctuation within that model. Further
observations of the temperature auto-correlation function will not elucidate
the issue; sufficiently high precision statistical observations already exist.
Instead, alternative probes are required. In this work we explore the
expectations for forthcoming polarization observations. We define a
prescription to test the hypothesis that the large-angle CMB temperature
perturbations in our Universe represent a rare statistical fluctuation within
the standard cosmological model. These tests are based on the temperature-$Q$
Stokes parameter correlation. Unfortunately these tests cannot be expected to
be definitive. However, we do show that if this $TQ$-correlation is observed to
be sufficiently large over an appropriately chosen angular range, then the
hypothesis can be rejected at a high confidence level. We quantify these
statements and optimize the statistics we have constructed to apply to the
anticipated polarization data. We find that we can construct a statistic that
has a 25 per cent chance of excluding the hypothesis that we live in a rare

use recently developed analytical results Aulisa et al. (2009) and write the

pressure with the nonlinearity that depends on the pressure gradient. The
coarse scale parameters for the steady state problem are determined so that the
volumetric average of velocity of the flow in the domain on fine scale and on
coarse scale are close enough. A flow-based coarsening approach is used, where
the equivalent permeability tensor is first evaluated following the streamline
of the existing linear cases, and successively modified in order to take into
account the nonlinear effects. Compared to previous works Durlofsky and
Karimi-Fard (2009) and Peszynska et al. (2009), our approach relies on recent
analytical results of Aulisa et al. (2009) and combines it with rigorous
mathematical upscaling theory for monotone operators. The developed upscaling
algorithm for nonlinear steady state problems is effectively used for variety
of heterogeneities in the domain of computation. Direct numerical computations
for average velocity and productivity index justify the usage of the coarse
scale parameters obtained for the special steady state case in the fully
transient problem. Analytical upscaling formulas in stratified domain are
obtained for the nonlinear case. They correlate with high accuracy with

An outstanding question is what is the correct ordering of the masses, the

the symmetry of the simultaneous interchange of hierarchy and the sign of

emergence and vary the parameters in the initial conditions. An analytical

positive correlations with the field strength and twist intensity. The HDF
duration has a weak relation with the twist, while it shows negative dependency

noisy measurements $y$ of a known, possibly nonlinear, map $\mathcal{G}$
applied to $u$. We adopt a Bayesian approach to the problem and work in a
setting where the prior measure is specified as a Gaussian random field
$\mu_0$. We work under a natural set of conditions on the likelihood which
imply the existence of a well-posed posterior measure, $\mu^y$. Under these
conditions we show that the {\em maximum a posteriori} (MAP) estimator is
well-defined as the minimiser of an Onsager-Machlup functional defined on the
Cameron-Martin space of the prior; thus we link a problem in probability with a
problem in the calculus of variations. We then consider the case where the
observational noise vanishes and establish a form of Bayesian posterior
consistency. We also prove a similar result for the case where the observation
of $\mathcal{G}(u)$ can be repeated as many times as desired with independent
identically distributed noise. The theory is illustrated with examples from an
inverse problem for the Navier-Stokes equation, motivated by problems arising
in weather forecasting, and from the theory of conditioned diffusions,
motivated by problems arising in molecular dynamics.

recent advances in 2D appearance models for visual object tracking, we
contribute this survey, which provides a detailed review of the existing 2D
appearance models. In particular, this survey takes a module-based architecture
that enables readers to easily grasp the key points of visual object tracking.
In this survey, we first decompose the problem of appearance modeling into two
different processing stages: visual representation and statistical modeling.
Then, different 2D appearance models are categorized and discussed with respect
to their composition modules. Finally, we address several issues of interest as
well as the remaining challenges for future research on this topic. The
contributions of this survey are four-fold. First, we review the literature of
visual representations according to their feature-construction mechanisms
(i.e., local and global). Second, the existing statistical modeling schemes for
tracking-by-detection are reviewed according to their model-construction
mechanisms: generative, discriminative, and hybrid generative-discriminative.
Third, each type of visual representations or statistical modeling techniques
is analyzed and discussed from a theoretical or practical viewpoint. Fourth,
the existing benchmark resources (e.g., source code and video datasets) are
examined in this survey.

tracer of mass accretion from protoplanetary disks onto young stars. Pf-beta
was serendipitously observed in NIRSPEC and CRIRES surveys of CO fundamental
emission, amounting to a sample size of 120 young stars with detected Pf-beta
emission. Using a subsample of disks with previously measured accretion
luminosities, we show that Pf-beta line luminosity is well correlated with
accretion luminosity over a range of at least three orders of magnitude. We use
this correlation to derive accretion luminosities for all 120 targets, 65 of
which are previously unreported in the literature. We also report accretion
rates for 67 targets, 16 previously unmeasured. Our large sample size and our
ability to probe high extinction values allow for relatively unbiased
comparisons between different types of disks. We find that the transitional
disks in our sample have lower than average Pf-beta line luminosities, and thus
accretion luminosities, at a marginally significant level. We also show that
high Pf-beta equivalent width is a signature of transitional disks with high
inner disk gas/dust ratios. In contrast, we find that disks with signatures of
slow disk winds have Pf-beta luminosities comparable to those of other disks in
our sample. Finally, we investigate accretion rates for stage I disks,
including significantly embedded targets. We find that stage I and stage II
disks have statistically indistinguishable Pf-beta line luminosities, implying
similar accretion rates, and that the accretion rates of stage I disks are too
low to be consistent with quiescent accretion. Our results are instead
consistent with both observational and theoretical evidence that stage I
objects experience episodic, rather than quiescent, accretion.

classification problem can pose several challenges. Because the class of

available explanatory variables are often moderately high dimensional. In the
four assays of our drug-discovery application, compounds are active or not
against a specific biological target, such as lung cancer tumor cells, and
active compounds are rare. Several sets of chemical descriptor variables from
computational chemistry are available to classify the active versus inactive

structure of the compounds. The statistical challenge is to make use of the
richness of the explanatory variables in the presence of scant response
information. Our algorithm divides the explanatory variables into subsets
adaptively and passes each subset to a base classifier. The various base
classifiers are then ensembled to produce one model to rank new objects by
their estimated probabilities of belonging to the rare class of interest. The
essence of the algorithm is to choose the subsets such that variables in the
same group work well together; we call such groups phalanxes.

massive stars, the GRB rate does not follow the global cosmic star formation
rate and, within their hosts, GRBs are more concentrated in regions of very
high star formation. We explain both puzzles here. Using the publicly available
VESPA database of SDSS Data Release 7 spectra, we explore a multi-parameter
space in galaxy properties, like stellar mass, metallicity, dust etc. to find
the sub-set of galaxies that reproduce the recently obtained GRB rate by
Wanderman & Piran (2010). We find that only galaxies with present stellar
masses below < 10^{10} Msun and low metallicity reproduce the observed GRB
rate. This is consistent with direct observations of GRB hosts and provides an
independent confirmation of the nature of GRB hosts. Because of the
significantly larger sample of SDSS galaxies, we compute their correlation
function and show that they are anti-biased with respect to the dark matter:
they are in filaments and voids. Using recent observations of massive stars in
local dwarfs we show how the fact that GRB hosts galaxies are dwarfs can
explain the observation that GRBs are more concentrated in regions of high star

the Bi-2212/Ag wire is full heat treated, this decomposes with slow heating to
400{\deg}C in pure O2. After the full reaction, we found that the TiO2 did not

of this paper is to carefully study the extent to which finite morphisms of
algebraic K-curves are controlled by certain combinatorial objects, called
skeleta. A skeleton is a metric graph embedded in the Berkovich analytification
of X. A skeleton has the natural structure of a metrized complex of curves. We
prove that a finite morphism of K-curves gives rise to a finite harmonic
morphism of a suitable choice of skeleta. We use this to give analytic proofs
of stronger ""skeletonized"" versions of some foundational results
ofLiu-Lorenzini, Coleman, and Liu on simultaneous semistable reduction of
curves. We then consider the inverse problem of lifting finite harmonic
morphisms of metrized complexes to morphisms of curves over K. We prove that
every tamely ramified finite harmonic morphism of \Lambda-metrized complexes of
k-curves lifts to a finite morphism of K-curves. If in addition the
ramification points are marked, we obtain a complete classification of all such
lifts along with their automorphisms. This generalizes and provides new
analytic proofs of earlier results of Sa\""idi and Wewers. As an application, we
discuss the relationship between harmonic morphisms of metric graphs and
induced maps between component groups of N\'eron models, providing a negative
answer to a question of Ribet motivated by number theory.

faster time-to-market, and the ability to scale applications on demand
(Leighton, 2009). According to Gartner, while the hype grew exponentially
during 2008 and continued since, it is clear that there is a major shift
towards the cloud computing model and that the benefits may be substantial
(Gartner Hype-Cycle, 2012). However, as the shape of the cloud computing is
emerging and developing rapidly both conceptually and in reality, the
legal/contractual, economic, service quality, interoperability, security and
privacy issues still pose significant challenges. In this chapter, we describe
various service and deployment models of cloud computing and identify major
challenges. In particular, we discuss three critical challenges: regulatory,
security and privacy issues in cloud computing. Some solutions to mitigate
these challenges are also proposed along with a brief presentation on the
future trends in cloud computing deployment.

between the ac- cessible information and the Holevo bound in the framework of

ensemble of two pure qubit states, we show that one can evade the optimization
problem with the help of the Koashi-Winter relation. Further, for the general

data centers due to their high I/O performance and low energy consumption. As
SSDs write data out-of-place, garbage collection (GC) is required to erase and
reclaim space with invalid data. However, GC poses additional writes that
hinder the I/O performance, while SSD blocks can only endure a finite number of
erasures. Thus, there is a performance-durability tradeoff on the design space
of GC. To characterize the optimal tradeoff, this paper formulates an
analytical model that explores the full optimal design space of any GC
algorithm. We first present a stochastic Markov chain model that captures the
I/O dynamics of large-scale SSDs, and adapt the mean-field approach to derive
the asymptotic steady-state performance. We further prove the model convergence
and generalize the model for all types of workload. Inspired by this model, we
propose a randomized greedy algorithm (RGA) that can operate along the optimal
tradeoff curve with a tunable parameter. Using trace-driven simulation on
DiskSim with SSD add-ons, we demonstrate how RGA can be parameterized to
realize the performance-durability tradeoff.

stars from the contamination of other evolved stars such as asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) and red horizontal branch (RHB) stars by using the CH(G) index
versus (g-r) diagram if the metallicity is known from the spectra. When this
diagram is applied to field giant stars with similar metallicity, we establish
a calibration of CH(G)=1.625(g-r)-1.174(g-r)^2-0.934. This method is confirmed
by stars with [Fe/H]~2.3 where spectra of member stars in globular clusters M15
and M92 are available in the SDSS database. We thus extend this kind of
calibration to every individual metallicity bin ranging from [Fe/H] ~ -3.0 to
[Fe/H] ~ 0.0 by using field red giant stars with 0.4 < (g-r) < 1.0. The
metallicity-dependent calibrations give CH(G) =1.625(g-r)-1.174(g-r)^2+

CH(G)=0.953(g-r)-0.655(g-r)^2+0.060[Fe/H]-0.650 for -1.2 < [Fe/H] < 0.0. The
calibrations are valid for the SDSS spectroscopic data set, and they cannot be
applied blindly to other data sets. With the two calibrations, a significant
number of the contaminating stars (AGB and RHB stars) were excluded and thus a
clear sample of red giant stars is obtained by selecting stars within 0.05 mag

make use of the peculiar transport properties of the massless carriers. A good
example of current fashion is the heavily studied graphene, a single atomic
layered graphite. It not only offers a prototype of Dirac physics in the field

various exotic phenomena. In the meantime, numerous routes have been attempted
to search for the next ""graphene"". Despite these efforts, to date there is
still no simple guideline to predict and engineer such massless particles in
materials. Here, we propose a theoretical recipe to create Dirac cones into
anyone's favorite materials. The method allows to tailor the properties, such
as anisotropy and quantity, in any effective one-band two-dimensional lattice.
We demonstrate the validity of our theory with two examples on the square
lattice, an ""unlikely"" candidate hosting Dirac cones, and show that a
graphene-like low-energy electronic structure can be realized. The proposed
recipe can be applied in real materials via introduction of vacancy,
substitution or intercalation, and also extended to photonic crystal, molecular
array, and cold atoms systems.

constant throughout the burst. We reanalyzed 332 photospheric radius expansion
bursts observed from 40 sources by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, introducing
a multiplicative factor $f_a$ to the persistent emission contribution in our
spectral fits. We found that for the majority of spectra the best-fit value of
$f_a$ is significantly greater than 1, suggesting that the persistent emission
typically increases during a burst. Elevated $f_a$ values were not found solely
during the radius expansion interval of the burst, but were also measured in
the cooling tail. The modified model results in a lower average value of the
$\chi^2$ fit statistic, indicating superior spectral fits, but not yet to the
level of formal statistical consistency for all the spectra.
  We interpret the elevated $f_a$ values as an increase of the mass accretion
rate onto the neutron star during the burst, likely arising from the effects of
Poynting-Robertson drag on the disk material. We measured an inverse
correlation of $f_a$ with the persistent flux, consistent with theoretical
models of the disc response. We suggest that this modified approach may provide
more accurate burst spectral parameters, as well as offering a probe of the

However, in this approach one has to quantize the local and asymptotic energy

unique energy spectrum of black holes by adopting a top-down approach. The
physical links among the underlying quantum theory, statistical mechanics and

correspondence between asymptotic and local observations through the presence
of the surface gravity of the horizon as a parameter in the spectrum, rather
than being expressed as a function of area and consequently getting quantized

production and as a model organism for biological research. The genetic
diversity contained in the global population of yeast strains represents a
valuable resource for a number of fields, including genetics, bioengineering,

multiplexed, reduced genome sequencing strategy (known as RAD-seq) to genotype
a large collection of S. cerevisiae strains, isolated from a wide range of
geographical locations and environmental niches. The method permits the
sequencing of the same 1% of all genomes, producing a multiple sequence
alignment of 116,880 bases across 262 strains. We find diversity among these
strains is principally organized by geography, with European, North American,
Asian and African/S. E. Asian populations defining the major axes of genetic
variation. At a finer scale, small groups of strains from cacao, olives and
sake are defined by unique variants not present in other strains. One
population, containing strains from a variety of fermentations, exhibits high
levels of heterozygosity and mixtures of alleles from European and Asian
populations, indicating an admixed origin for this group. In the context of
this global diversity, we demonstrate that a collection of seven strains
commonly used in the laboratory encompasses only one quarter of the genetic
diversity present in the full collection of strains, underscoring the
relatively limited genetic diversity captured by the current set of lab
strains. We propose a model of geographic differentiation followed by
human-associated admixture, primarily between European and Asian populations
and more recently between European and North American populations. The large
collection of genotyped yeast strains characterized here will provide a useful
resource for the broad community of yeast researchers.

tidally disrupted by massive black holes. When a star is disrupted in a bound
orbit with moderate eccentricity instead of a parabolic orbit, the temporal
behavior of the resulting stellar debris changes qualitatively. The debris is
initially all bound, returning to pericenter in a short time ~ the original
stellar orbital timescale. The resulting fallback rate can thus be much higher
than the Eddington rate. Furthermore if the star is disrupted close to the
hole, in a regime where general relativity is important, the stellar and debris
orbits display general relativistic precession. Apsidal precession can make the
debris stream cross itself after several orbits, likely leading to fast debris
energy dissipation. If the star is disrupted in an inclined orbit around a
spinning hole, nodal precession reduces the probability of self-intersection,
and circularization may take many dynamical timescales, delaying the onset of
flare activity. An examination of the particle dynamics suggests that
quasi-periodic flares with short durations, produced when the center of the
tidal stream passes pericenter, may occur in the early-time light curve. The
late-time light curve may still show power-law behavior which is generic to
disk accretion processes. The detection triggers for future surveys should be
extended to capture such ""non-standard"" short-term flaring activity before the
event enters the asymptotic decay phase, as this activity is likely to be more
sensitive to physical parameters such as the black hole spin.

relationship between all operator ideals and certain classical groups of

algebraic groups. Historically, this has already been done for only the
complete-norm ideals; in that case one can work within the framework of the
well-known Lie theory for Banach-Lie groups. That kind of Lie theory is not
applicable for arbitrary operator ideals, so we needed to find a new approach
for dealing with the general situation. The simplest instance of the
aforementioned relationship is provided by the Lie algebra
$\ug_{\Ic}(\Hc)=\{X\in\Ic\mid X^*=-X\}$ associated with the group
$\U_{\Ic}(\Hc)=\U(\Hc)\cap(\1+\Ic)$ where $\Ic$ is an arbitrary operator ideal

investigate the Cartan subalgebras (maximal abelian self-adjoint subalgebras)

uncountably many $\U_{\Ic}(\Hc)$-conjugacy classes of these Cartan subalgebras.

  commutators of compact operators","20 pages",,,,"math.FA math.OA math.RT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A sequel to \cite{gW05}, we address again the single commutator problem
\cite{PT71} of Pearcy and Topping: Is every compact operator a single
commutator of compact operators? by focusing on a 35 year old test question for
this posed in 1976 by the last named author and others: Are there any strictly
positive operators that are single commutators of compact operators? The latter
we settle here affirmatively with a modest modification of Anderson's
fundamental construction \cite{jA77} constructing compact operators whose
commutator is a rank one projection. Moreover we provide here a rich class of
such strictly positive operators that are commutators of compact operators and
pose a question for the rest.
  We explain also how these methods are related to the study of staircase
matrix forms, their equivalent block tri-diagonal forms, and commutator
problems. In particular, we present the original test question and solution
that led to the negative solution of the Pearcy-Topping question on whether or
not every trace class trace zero operator was a commutator (or linear
combination of commutators) of Hilbert-Schmidt operators. And we show how this
evolved from staircase form considerations along with a Larry Brown result on
trace connections to ideals \cite{lB94} which itself is at the core of
\cite[Section 7]{DFWW}.
  The omission in \cite{gW05} of this important 35 year old test question was
inadvertent and we correct that in this paper. This sequel starts where [ibid]
left off but can be read independently of [ibid].
  The present paper also has a section on self-commutator equations $[X^*,X]=A$
within the framework of some classical operator Lie algebras. That problem was
solved by Fan and Fong (1980) for the full algebra of compact operators, and we
solve it here for the complex symplectic Lie algebra of compact operators and
for complex semisimple Lie algebras.

Therefore, the standard implied volatility is {\it conditional}: it depends on
the future values of the risk free rate. We study two implied parameters: the

They can be found unconditionally from a system of two equations. We found that

have individual material properties and associated stress-free configurations
that evolve over time. This gives rise to residual stresses contributing to the
homoeostatic state of stress in vivo as well as adaptations to perturbed loads,
disease or injury. The existence of residual stresses in an intact but
load-free excised arterial segment suggests compressive and tensile stresses,
respectively, in the inner and outer walls. Accordingly, an artery ring springs
open into a sector after a radial cut. The measurement of the opening angle is
commonly used to deduce the residual stresses, which are the stresses required
to close back the ring. The opening angle method provides an average estimate
of circumferential residual stresses but it gives no information on local
distributions through the thickness and along the axial direction. To address
this lack, a new method is proposed in this article to derive maps of residual
stresses using an approach based on the contour method. A piece of freshly
excised tissue is carefully cut into the specimen, and the local distribution
of residual strains and stresses is determined from whole-body digital image

symmetry $T'$, the double covering of $A_4$, in which the hierarchies of
charged fermion masses and the mildness of neutrino masses are responsible for
Higgs scalars. After spontaneous breaking of flavor symmetry, with the
constraint of renormalizability in the Lagrangian, the leptons have $m_{e}=0$
and the quarks have the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) mixing angles
$\theta^{q}_{12}=13^{\circ}, \theta^{q}_{23}=0^{\circ}$ and
$\theta^{q}_{13}=0^{\circ}$. Thus, certain effective dimension-5 operators are
introduced, which induce $m_{e}\neq0$ and lead the quark mixing matrix to the
CKM one in form. On the other hand, the neutrino Lagrangian still keeps
renormalizability. For completeness, we show numerical analysis: in the lepton
sector, only normal mass hierarchy is permitted within $3\sigma$ experimental
bounds with the prediction of both large deviations from maximality in the
atmospheric mixing angle $\theta_{23}$ and the measured values of reactor
angle. So, future precise measurements of $\theta_{23}$, whether
$\theta_{23}\rightarrow45^{\circ}$ or
$|\theta_{23}-45^{\circ}|\rightarrow5^{\circ}$, will either exclude or favor
our model. Together with it, our model makes predictions for the Dirac CP
phase, which is almost compatible with the global analysis in $1\sigma$
experimental bounds. Moreover, we show the effective mass $|m_{ee}|$ measurable
in neutrinoless double beta decay to be in the range
$0.04\lesssim|m_{ee}|[eV]<0.11$, which can be tested in near future neutrino

From a software approach, while a set of novel data management technologies
appear in the market e.g. key-value based or in-memory databases, classic
relational database management systems (RDBMS) are still widely used. In
addition from a hardware perspective, the majority of database servers is still
using standard magnetic hard drives (HDDs) instead of solid state drives (SSDs)
due to lower cost of storage per gigabyte, disregarding the performance boost
that might be given due to high cost.
  In this study we focus on a software based assessment of the energy
consumption of a database server by running three different and complete
database workloads namely TCP-H, Star Schema Benchmark -SSB as well a modified
benchmark we have derived for this study called W22. We profile the energy
distribution among the ost important server components and by using different
resource allocation we assess the energy consumption of a typical open source
RDBMS (PostgreSQL) on a standard server in relation with its performance
(measured by query time).
  Results confirm the well-known fact that even for complete workloads,
optimization of the RDBMS results to lower energy consumption.

system size on the torus. More generally, an infinite family of lattice loop
models is studied on the torus and related to the corresponding
Fortuin-Kasteleyn random cluster models. Starting with a cylinder, the
commuting periodic single-row transfer matrices are built from the periodic
Temperley-Lieb algebra extended by the shift operators Omega and Omega^{-1}. In
this enlarged algebra, the non-contractible loop fugacity is alpha and the
contractible loop fugacity is beta. The torus is formed by gluing the top and
bottom of the cylinder. This gives rise to a variety of non-contractible loops
winding around the torus. Because of their nonlocal nature, the standard matrix
trace does not produce the proper geometric torus. Instead, we introduce a
modified matrix trace for this purpose. This is achieved by using a
representation of the enlarged periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra with a parameter
v that keeps track of the winding of defects on the cylinder. The transfer
matrix representatives and their eigenvalues thus depend on v. The modified
trace is constructed as a linear functional on planar connectivity diagrams in
terms of matrix traces Tr_d (with a fixed number of defects d) and Chebyshev
polynomials of the first kind. For critical dense polymers, where beta=0, the
transfer matrix eigenvalues are obtained by solving a functional equation in
the form of an inversion identity. The solution depends on d and is subject to
selection rules which we prove. Simplifications occur if all non-contractible
loop fugacities are set to alpha=2 in which case the traces are evaluated at
v=1. In the continuum scaling limit, the corresponding conformal torus

effects due to both the small mass difference between the up and down quarks
and the QED interaction. Our proposal is applicable in principle to any QCD+QED
gauge invariant hadronic observable which can be computed on the lattice. It is
based on the expansion of the path-integral in powers of the small parameters
(m_d - m_u)/Lambda_{QCD} and alpha_{em}, where m_f is the renormalized quark
mass and alpha_{em} the renormalized fine structure constant. In this paper we
discuss in detail the general strategy of the method and the conventional,
although arbitrary, separation of QCD from QED isospin breaking corrections. We
obtain results for the pion mass splitting, M_{pi+}^2-M_{pi0}^2= 1.44(13)(16) x
10^3 MeV^2, for the Dashen's theorem breaking parameter epsilon_{gamma}=
0.79(18)(18), for the light quark masses, [m_d - m_u](MSbar,2 GeV)= 2.39(8)(17)
MeV, [m_u / m_d](MSbar,2 GeV)= 0.50(2)(3) and for the flavour symmetry breaking
parameters R and Q. We also update our previous results for the QCD isospin
breaking corrections to the Kl2 decay rate and for the QCD contribution to the
neutron-proton mass splitting.

(MEDP) in undirected graphs, and in particular, the integrality gap of the
natural multicommodity flow based relaxation for it. The integrality gap is
known to be $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ even for planar graphs due to a simple
topological obstruction and a major focus, following earlier work, has been
understanding the gap if some constant congestion is allowed.
  In this context, it is natural to ask for which classes of graphs does a
constant-factor constant-congestion property hold. It is easy to deduce that
for given constant bounds on the approximation and congestion, the class of
""nice"" graphs is nor-closed. Is the converse true? Does every proper
minor-closed family of graphs exhibit a constant factor, constant congestion
bound relative to the LP relaxation? We conjecture that the answer is yes.
  One stumbling block has been that such bounds were not known for bounded
treewidth graphs (or even treewidth 3). In this paper we give a polytime
algorithm which takes a fractional routing solution in a graph of bounded
treewidth and is able to integrally route a constant fraction of the LP
solution's value. Note that we do not incur any edge congestion. Previously
this was not known even for series parallel graphs which have treewidth 2. The
algorithm is based on a more general argument that applies to $k$-sums of
graphs in some graph family, as long as the graph family has a constant factor,
constant congestion bound. We then use this to show that such bounds hold for
the class of $k$-sums of bounded genus graphs.

three-body interactions and apply it to isotopic chains around oxygen for the
first time. The third-order algebraic diagrammatic construction [ADC(3)]
equations for two-body Hamiltonians can be exploited upon defining
system-dependent one- and two-body interactions coming from the three-body
force, and correspondingly dropping interaction reducible diagrams. This goes
beyond the standard normal ordering truncations recently used in ab-inito
studies. The Koltun sum rule for the total binding energy acquires a correction
due to the added three-body interaction. This formalism is then applied to
study chiral two-nucleon (2N) and three-nucleon forces (3NF) evolved to low
momentum cutoffs. We find that these interactions reproduce the binding
energies of nitrogen, oxygen and fluorine isotopes to great accuracy, providing
clear indication of the predictive power of this approach. All three neutron
driplines are correctly predicted when full 3NF are included. The formalism
introduced also allows to calculate form factors for nucleon transfer on doubly
magic systems.

lowness notions. Given a randomness notion R, we ask for which sequences A does
relativization to A leave R unchanged (i.e., R^A = R)? Such sequences are call
low for R. This question extends to a pair of randomness notions R and S, where
S is weaker: for which A is S^A still weaker than R? In the last few years,
many results have characterized the sequences that are low for randomness by
their low computational strength. A few results have also given
measure-theoretic characterizations of low sequences. For example, Kjos-Hanssen
proved that A is low for Martin-L\""of randomness if and only if every A-c.e.
open set of measure less than 1 can be covered by a c.e. open set of measure
less than 1. In this paper, we give a series of results showing that a wide
variety of lowness notions can be expressed in a similar way, i.e., via the
ability to cover open sets of a certain type by open sets of some other type.
This provides a unified framework that clarifies the study of lowness for
randomness notions, and allows us to give simple proofs of a number of known
results. We also use this framework to prove new results, including showing
that the classes Low(MLR;SR) and Low(W2R;SR) coincide, answering a question of
Nies. Other applications include characterizations of highness notions, a
broadly applicable explanation for why low for randomness is the same as low
for tests, and a simple proof that Low(W2R;S)=Low(MLR;S), where S is the class
of Martin-L\""of, computable, or Schnorr random sequences. The final section
gives characterizations of lowness notions using summable functions and
convergent measure machines instead of open covers. We finish with a simple
proof of a result of Nies, that Low(MLR) = Low(MLR; CR).

Irradiation by
nearby massive stars can photoevaporate protoplanetary disks around young stars
(so-called proplyds) which raises questions regarding the ability of planet
formation to take place in these environments. We investigate the
two-dimensional physical and chemical structure of a protoplanetary disk
surrounding a low-mass (T Tauri) star which is irradiated by a nearby massive
O-type star to determine the survivability and observability of molecules in
proplyds. Compared with an isolated star-disk system, the gas temperature
ranges from a factor of a few (in the disk midplane) to around two orders of
magnitude (in the disk surface) higher in the irradiated disk. Although the UV
flux in the outer disk, in particular, is several orders of magnitude higher,
the surface density of the disk is sufficient for effective shielding of the
disk midplane so that the disk remains predominantly molecular in nature. We
also find that non-volatile molecules, such as HCN and H2O, are able to freeze
out onto dust grains in the disk midplane so that the formation of icy
planetesimals, e.g., comets, may also be possible in proplyds. We have
calculated the molecular line emission from the disk assuming LTE and
determined that multiple transitions of atomic carbon, CO (and isotopologues,
13CO and C18O), HCO+, CN, and HCN may be observable with ALMA, allowing
characterization of the gas column density, temperature, and optical depth in
proplyds at the distance of Orion (~400 pc).

sites determines the form of the drift mobility field dependence. Particular
kind of spatial correlation in a disordered material depends on its nature.
Mobility field dependences have to be different in polar and nonpolar
materials. Different methods of mobility calculation from the shape of
photocurrent transient are analyzed. A widely used method is very sensitive to
the variation of the shape of the transient and sometimes produces results that
effectively masquerade the true dependence of the mobility on electric field or
trap concentration. Arguments in favor of the better, more reliable method are
suggested. Charge transport in materials containing charged traps is considered
without using the isolated trap approximation and this leads to qualitatively
different results. They indicate that the effect of charged traps can hardly be

sufficiently large pairs. Screening changes the linear attraction potential of
vortices to a logarithmic one, and leads to the familiar pair dissociation
mechanism of the BKT type phase transition. The topological charge model is
confirmed by numerical simulations, in which we demonstrate that the transition
temperature slightly increases when compared with the BKT result for
short-range interactions.

significant potential to make spectrum use more efficient. In this paper, the
feasibility and potential benefit of replacing the current terrestrial UHF TV
broadcasting system with a mobile, cellular data (IP-) network is analyzed. In
the cellular network, TV content would be provided as {one} of the services,
here referred to as CellTV. In the investigation we consider typical Swedish
rural and urban environments. We use different models for TV viewing patterns
and cellular technologies as expected in the year 2020. Results of the

the TV consumption trend goes towards more specialized programming, more local

flexible unicast capabilities, will be an ideal platform to provide these
services. However, the results also demonstrate that CellTV is not a

gene expression. The dynamics of pol-II moving along the transcribed region
influence the rate and timing of gene expression. In this work we present a
probabilistic model of transcription dynamics which is fitted to pol-II
occupancy time course data measured using ChIP-Seq. The model can be used to
estimate transcription speed and to infer the temporal pol-II activity profile
at the gene promoter. Model parameters are estimated using either maximum
likelihood estimation or via Bayesian inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo
sampling. The Bayesian approach provides confidence intervals for parameter
estimates and allows the use of priors that capture domain knowledge, e.g. the
expected range of transcription speeds, based on previous experiments. The
model describes the movement of pol-II down the gene body and can be used to
identify the time of induction for transcriptionally engaged genes. By
clustering the inferred promoter activity time profiles, we are able to
determine which genes respond quickly to stimuli and group genes that share
activity profiles and may therefore be co-regulated. We apply our methodology
to biological data obtained using ChIP-seq to measure pol-II occupancy
genome-wide when MCF-7 human breast cancer cells are treated with estradiol
(E2). The transcription speeds we obtain agree with those obtained previously
for smaller numbers of genes with the advantage that our approach can be
applied genome-wide. We validate the biological significance of the pol-II
promoter activity clusters by investigating cluster-specific transcription
factor binding patterns and determining canonical pathway enrichment. We find
that rapidly induced genes are enriched for both estrogen receptor alpha

scheme and study the non-linear response to a weak optical probe in presence of
a strong control beam. For very low probe fields, the dominant nonlinearities
are of the third order and they can be exactly evaluated in a steady state
regime. In a more general case, the change in average atomic populations and
coherences due to Rydberg interactions can be characterized by properly defined
scaling parameters, which are generally complex numbers but in certain
situations take the usual meaning of the number of atoms in a blockade sphere.
They can be used in a simple ""universal scaling"" formula to determine the
dispersive optical nonlinearity of the medium. We also develop a novel
technique to account for the Rydberg interaction effects, by simplifying the
treatment of nonlocal interaction terms, the so-called collisional integrals.
We find algebraic relations that only involve two-body correlations, which can
be solved numerically. All average populations and coherences are then obtained
straightforwardly.

measurements of the solar magnetic field during the unusually long minimum of
Solar Cycle 23. Due to the unique configuration of the STEREO s/c orbits we are
able to investigate spatial variations in the intensity of the corotating ions
on time scales of less than one solar rotation. The observations reveal that
the occurrence of the strong CIR events was the most frequent at the beginning
of the period. The inclination of the heliospheric current sheet relative to
the heliographic equator (the tilt angle) was quite high in the first stage of
the mission and gradually flattened with the time, followed by a decrease in
the CIR activity. By examining the differences between measurements on the two
STEREO s/c we discuss how the changes in the position of the s/c relative to
the CIRs affect the energetic particle observations. We combine STEREO
observations with observations from the ULEIS instrument on the ACE s/c and
argue that the main factor which controls the differences in the ion
intensities is the latitudinal separation between the two STEREO s/c relative
to the tilted CIRs. The position of the s/c is less important when the tilt
angle is high. In this case we found that the CIR ion intensity positively
correlates with the tilt angle.

logical unit of quantum computation-- owing to its outstanding spin coherence
properties and compatibility to standard electronics. A remarkable limitation
for spin quantum computing in Si hosts is the orbital degeneracy of this
material's conduction band, preventing the spin-1/2 states from being an
isolated two-level system. So far available samples of Si quantum wells cladded
by Ge-Si alloy barriers provide relatively small valley splitting (VS), with
the order of 1 meV or less, degrading the fidelity of qubits encoded in spin
""up"" and ""down"" states in Si. Here, based on an atomically resolved
pseudopotential theory, we demonstrate that ordered Ge-Si layered barriers
confining a Si slab can be harnessed to enhance the VS in the active Si region
by up to one order of magnitude compared to the random alloy barriers adopted
so far. A biologically inspired genetic-algorithm search is employed to
identify magic Ge/Si layer sequences of the superlattice barriers that isolate
the electron ground state in a single valley composition with VS as large as ~9
meV. The enhanced VS is preserved with the reasonable inter-layer mixing
between different species, and is interestingly ""protected"" even if some larger
mixing occurs. Implementation of the optimized layer sequences of barriers,
within reach of modern superlattice growth techniques, overcomes in a practical
systematic way the main current limitations related to the orbital degeneracy,
thus providing a roadmap for reliable spin-only quantum computing in Si.

the frustration degree and modulates the exchange interaction in this system,

Therefore, the magnetoelectric transition temperature at 23 K in CoCr2O4 is
shifted to lower temperature with increased dopants. The magnetostriction

galaxies that formed early in the universe and had enough time to deplete their
$L^{*}$ galaxies through successive mergers of member galaxies, building up one
massive central elliptical, but retaining the group X-ray halo. Considering
that fossils are the remnants of mergers in ordinary groups, the merger history
of the progenitor group is expected to be imprinted in the fossil central
galaxy (FCG). We present for the first time radial gradients of single-stellar
population (SSP) ages and metallicites in a sample of FCGs to constrain their
formation scenario. Our sample comprises some of the most massive galaxies in
the universe exhibiting an average central velocity dispersion of
$\sigma_0=271\pm28$ km s$^{-1}$. Metallicity gradients are throughout negative
with comparatively flat slopes of $\nabla_{[\rm{Fe/H}]}=- 0.19\pm0.08$ while
age gradients are found to be insignificant ($\nabla_{\rm{age}}=0.00\pm0.05$).
All FCGs lie on the fundamental plane, suggesting that they are virialised
systems. We find that gradient strengths and central metallicities are similar
to those found in cluster ellipticals of similar mass. The comparatively flat
metallicity gradients with respect to those predicted by monolithic collapse
($\nabla_{Z}=-0.5$) suggest that fossils are indeed the result of multiple
major mergers. Hence we conclude that fossils are not 'failed groups' that
formed with a top heavy luminosity function. The low scatter of gradient slopes
suggests a similar merging history for all galaxies in our sample.

combinatorial optimisation problem. Its computational intractability has
attracted a number of heuristic approaches to generate satisfactory, if not
optimal, candidate solutions. In this paper we demonstrate a simple
unconventional computation method to approximate the Euclidean TSP using a
virtual material approach. The morphological adaptation behaviour of the
material emerges from the low-level interactions of a population of particles
moving within a diffusive lattice. A `blob' of this material is placed over a
set of data points projected into the lattice, representing TSP city locations,
and the blob is reduced in size over time. As the blob shrinks it
morphologically adapts to the configuration of the cities. The shrinkage
process automatically stops when the blob no longer completely covers all
cities. By manually tracing the perimeter of the blob a path between cities is
elicited corresponding to a TSP tour. Over 6 runs on 20 randomly generated
datasets of 20 cities this simple and unguided method found tours with a mean
best tour length of 1.04, mean average tour length of 1.07 and mean worst tour
length of 1.09 when expressed as a fraction of the minimal tour computed by an
exact TSP solver. We examine the insertion mechanism by which the blob
constructs a tour, note some properties and limitations of its performance, and
discuss the relationship between the blob TSP and proximity graphs which group
points on the plane. The method is notable for its simplicity and the spatially
represented mechanical mode of its operation. We discuss similarities between
this method and previously suggested models of human performance on the TSP and
suggest possibilities for further improvement.

In this paper, we describe the systematic query and caching procedure of SEPI.
SEPI begins with finding a clique tree from a Bayesian network-the standard
procedure of the evidence potential algorithm. With the clique tree, various
probability distributions are computed and stored in each clique. This is the
?pre-processing? step of SEPI. Once this step is done, the query can then be
computed. To process a query, a recursive process similar to the SPI algorithm
is used. The queries are directed to the root clique and decomposed into
queries for the clique's subtrees until a particular query can be answered at
the clique at which it is directed. The algorithm and the computation are
simple. The SEPI algorithm will be presented in this paper along with several
examples.

that the concentration on theoretical techniques for the evaluation and

issues in decision making. Although numerical methods of reasoning under
uncertainty have strong theoretical foundations, they are representationally
weak and only deal with a small part of the decision process. Knowledge based

accompanied by a clear decision theory. We describe here work which is under

A central proposal is an extended form of inference which we call
argumentation; reasoning for and against decision options from generalised
domain theories. The approach has been successfully used in several decision
support applications, but it is argued that a comprehensive decision theory
must cover autonomous decision making, where the agent can formulate questions
as well as take decisions. A major theoretical challenge for this theory is to
capture the idea of reflection to permit decision agents to reason about their

prove the existence of and give explicit formulas for conjunction and
disjunction in the subcategory of separable belief functions. In Dempster?s
category, the new defined conjunction can be seen as the most cautious
conjunction of beliefs, and thus no assumption about distinctness (of the

may consist of selecting one of its elements, subject to the operation of
chance, or of observing the elements, subject to imprecision. A priori
uncertainty about the actual result of the experiment may be quantified,
representing either the likelihood of the choice of :r_X or the degree to which
any such X would be suitable as a description of the outcome. The former case
corresponds to a probability distribution, while the latter gives a possibility
assignment on X. The study of such assignments and their properties falls
within the purview of possibility theory [DP88, Y80, Z783. It, like probability
theory, assigns values between 0 and 1 to express likelihoods of outcomes.
Here, however, the similarity ends. Possibility theory uses the maximum and
minimum functions to combine uncertainties, whereas probability theory uses the
plus and times operations. This leads to very dissimilar theories in terms of
analytical framework, even though they share several semantic concepts. One of
the shared concepts consists of expressing quantitatively the uncertainty
associated with a given distribution. In probability theory its value
corresponds to the gain of information that would result from conducting an
experiment and ascertaining an actual result. This gain of information can
equally well be viewed as a decrease in uncertainty about the outcome of an
experiment. In this case the standard measure of information, and thus
uncertainty, is Shannon entropy [AD75, G77]. It enjoys several advantages-it is
characterized uniquely by a few, very natural properties, and it can be
conveniently used in decision processes. This application is based on the
principle of maximum entropy; it has become a popular method of relating
decisions to uncertainty. This paper demonstrates that an equally integrated
theory can be built on the foundation of possibility theory. We first show how
to define measures of in formation and uncertainty for possibility assignments.
Next we construct an information-based metric on the space of all possibility
distributions defined on a given domain. It allows us to capture the notion of
proximity in information content among the distributions. Lastly, we show that
all the above constructions can be carried out for continuous
distributions-possibility assignments on arbitrary measurable domains. We
consider this step very significant-finite domains of discourse are but
approximations of the real-life infinite domains. If possibility theory is to
represent real world situations, it must handle continuous distributions both
directly and through finite approximations. In the last section we discuss a
principle of maximum uncertainty for possibility distributions. We show how
such a principle could be formalized as an inference rule. We also suggest it
could be derived as a consequence of simple assumptions about combining
information. We would like to mention that possibility assignments can be
viewed as fuzzy sets and that every fuzzy set gives rise to an assignment of
possibilities. This correspondence has far reaching consequences in logic and
in control theory. Our treatment here is independent of any special
interpretation; in particular we speak of possibility distributions and
possibility measures, defining them as measurable mappings into the interval
[0, 1]. Our presentation is intended as a self-contained, albeit terse summary.
Topics discussed were selected with care, to demonstrate both the completeness
and a certain elegance of the theory. Proofs are not included; we only offer

interpretation is a measure of how well defined an interpretation is in terms

is used to guide the inference process towards interpretations with a higher

the specificity and the strength of the inferences in it, where the strength of

gain, calculated as the maximal difference between the actual evidence
distribution in the knowledge base and the potential evidence determines each
consultation step. Hierarchically structured knowledge is an important
representation form and experts even use several hierarchies in parallel for
constituting their knowledge. Hence the control strategy is applied to a
layered set of distinct hierarchies. Depending on the actual data one of these
hierarchies is chosen by the control strategy for the next step in the
reasoning process. Provided the actual data are well matched to the structure
of one hierarchy, this hierarchy remains selected for a longer consultation
time. If no good match can be achieved, a switch from the actual hierarchy to a
competing one will result, very similar to the phenomenon of restructuring in
problem solving tasks. Up to now the control strategy is restricted to multi
hierarchical knowledge bases with disjunct hierarchies. It is implemented in
the expert system IBIG (inference by information gain), being presently applied
to acquired speech disorders (aphasia).

provides a sound b<msis for these quantitative measures, but also alleviates

compatible with monotonic belief functions. Moreover, a belief structure
slightly weaker than that of qualitative belief is compatible with Smets'

  no. 1, March 2008, 17-30",,,"q-fin.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Because of the prominent position of urban rail in reducing urban
transport-related problems, such as congestion and air pollution, insights into
the costs of possible new urban rail projects is very relevant for those
involved with cost estimations, policy makers, cost-benefit analysts, and other
target groups. Knowledge of the differences in costs per kilometre, including
explanations of differences and their breakdowns is currently lacking in the
literature. This paper aims to provide a first stage insight into how cost per
kilometre varies across urban rail projects. The methodology applied is a
simple cost comparison across projects where the data collected are comparable.
We conclude that capital costs per route-kilometre of urban rail vary highly
between projects. Looking at European projects and excluding outliers, the
total capital costs per route-kilometre (including stations and rolling stock)
lie mainly between US$50-100 million (2002 prices). Including US projects, the
range is US$50-150 million. The main reasons for the high variation in the
route-kilometre costs are differences between projects as regards the ratio of
underground to above-ground construction, ground conditions, station spacing,
type of rolling stock, environmental and safety constraints and labour costs.
We warn, however, that the observations used to reach the conclusions are too
few to obtain results with statistical significance. Our results must therefore
be seen as a first step towards collecting more data so that a more succinct
statistical analysis can be conducted. Another conclusion is therefore that
this area has future research potential.

Second, it documents a much neglected topic in economics: that ex ante

overruns, benefit shortfalls, and the systematic underestimation of risks.
Third, implications for cost-benefit analysis are described, including that
such analysis is not to be trusted for major infrastructure projects. Fourth,
the article uncovers the causes of this state of affairs in terms of perverse
incentives that encourage promoters to underestimate costs and overestimate
benefits in the business cases for their projects. But the projects that are
made to look best on paper are the projects that amass the highest cost
overruns and benefit shortfalls in reality. The article depicts this situation
as ""survival of the un-fittest."" Fifth, the article sets out to explain how the

with more spending on information technology is catapulting infrastructure
investment from the frying pan into the fire.

forecasters generally do a poor job of estimating the demand for transportation
infrastructure projects. The result is substantial downside financial and
economic risks. Such risks are typically ignored or downplayed by planners and
decision makers, to the detriment of social and economic welfare. For nine out
of ten rail projects passenger forecasts are overestimated; average
overestimation is 106 percent. This results in large benefit shortfalls for
rail projects. For half of all road projects the difference between actual and
forecasted traffic is more than plus/minus 20 percent. Forecasts have not
become more accurate over the 30-year period studied. If techniques and skills
for arriving at accurate demand forecasts have improved over time, as often
claimed by forecasters, this does not show in the data. The causes of
inaccuracy in forecasts are different for rail and road projects, with
political causes playing a larger role for rail than for road. The cure is
transparency, accountability, and new forecasting methods. The challenge is to
change the governance structures for forecasting and project development. The

scalar perturbation power spectrum of single-field inflation. Oscillations are
most naturally produced by modified vacua with varying phase. When this phase
changes rapidly, it induces strong interactions between the scalar
fluctuations. If the interactions are sufficiently strong the theory cannot be
evaluated using perturbation theory, hence imposing a limit on the oscillation
frequency. This complements the bound found by Weinberg governing the validity
of effective field theory. The generalized consistency relation also allows one
to use squeezed configurations of higher-point correlations to place
constraints on the power spectrum oscillations.

stress on cellular networks in fission yeast. Stress elicits a sophisticated
and large scale cellular response, involving a shift of resources from cell
growth and metabolism towards protection and maintenance. Previous work has
suggested that these changes can be appreciated at the network level.
  In this paper, we study two types of cellular networks: gene co-regulation
networks and weighted protein interaction networks. We show that in response to
oxidative stress, the co-regulation networks re-organize towards a more
modularised structure: while sets of genes become more tightly co-regulated,
co-regulation between these modules is decreased. This shift translates into
longer average shortest path length, increased transitivity, and decreased
modular overlap in these networks. We also find a similar change in structure
in the weighted protein interaction network in response to both oxidative
stress and nitrogen starvation, confirming and extending previous findings.
  These changes in network structure could represent an increase in network
robustness and/or the emergence of more specialised functional modules.
Additionally, we find stress induces tighter co-regulation of non-coding RNAs,
decreased functional importance of splicing factors, as well as changes in the
centrality of genes involved in chromatin organization, cytoskeleton
organization, cell division, and protein turnover.

(PDRs) associated with the ultra-compact HII region Mon R2. Our goal is to
determine the variations of the abundance of small hydrocarbons in a high-UV
irradiated PDR and investigate their chemistry. We present an observational
study of CH, CCH and c-C$_3$H$_2$ in Mon R2 combining data obtained with the
IRAM 30m telescope and Herschel. We determine the column densities of these
species, and compare their spatial distributions with that of polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH). We compare the observational results with different
chemical models to explore the relative importance of gas-phase, grain-surface
and time-dependent chemistry in these environments. The emission of the small
hydrocarbons show different patterns. The CCH emission is extended while CH and
c-C$_3$H$_2$ are concentrated towards the more illuminated layers of the PDR.
The ratio of the column densities of c-C$_3$H$_2$ and CCH shows spatial
variations up to a factor of a few, increasing from
$N(c-C$_3$H$_2$)/N(CCH)\approx0.004$ in the envelope to a maximum of
$\sim0.015-0.029$ towards the 8$\mu$m emission peak. Comparing these results
with other galactic PDRs, we find that the abundance of CCH is quite constant
over a wide range of G$_0$, whereas the abundance of c-C$_3$H$_2$ is higher in
low-UV PDRs. In Mon R2, the gas-phase steady-state chemistry can account
relatively well for the abundances of CH and CCH in the most exposed layers of
the PDR, but falls short by a factor of 10 to reproduce c-C$_3$H$_2$.
  In the molecular envelope, time-dependent effects and grain surface chemistry
play a dominant role in determining the hydrocarbons abundances. Our study
shows that CCH and c-C$_3$H$_2$ present a complex chemistry in which UV
photons, grain-surface chemistry and time dependent effects contribute to
determine their abundances.

this analysis excludes the Planck era because the background space-time
satisfies Einstein's equations all the way back to the big bang singularity.
Using techniques from loop quantum gravity, the paradigm has now been extended
to a self-consistent theory from the Planck regime to the onset of inflation,
covering some 11 orders of magnitude in curvature. In addition, for a narrow
window of initial conditions, there are departures from the standard paradigm,
with novel effects, such as a modification of the consistency relation
involving the scalar and tensor power spectra and a new source for
non-Gaussianities. Thus, the genesis of the large scale structure of the

determined by how quickly operands are accessed by cores, rather than by the
speed of computation per operand. From high-performance computing (HPC) to
mobile application processors, low multicore utilization rates result from the
slowness of accessing off-chip operands, i.e. the memory wall. The APplication
AXcelerator (APAX) universal numerical encoder reduces computing's memory wall
by compressing numerical operands (integers and floats), thereby decreasing CPU
access time by 3:1 to 10:1 as operands stream between memory and cores. APAX
encodes numbers using a low-complexity algorithm designed both for time series
sensor data and for multi-dimensional data, including images. APAX encoding
parameters are determined by a profiler that quantifies the uncertainty
inherent in numerical datasets and recommends encoding parameters reflecting
this uncertainty. Compatible software, FPGA, and systemon-chip (SoC)
implementations efficiently support encoding rates between 150 MByte/sec and
1.5 GByte/sec at low power. On 25 integer and floating-point datasets, we
achieved encoding rates between 3:1 and 10:1, with average correlation of

simulation. We follow individual GMCs (defined in our simulations by a total
column density criterion), including their level of star formation, from their
formation to dispersal. We find the evolution of GMCs is highly complex. GMCs
often form from a combination of smaller clouds and ambient ISM, and similarly
disperse by splitting into a number of smaller clouds and ambient ISM. However
some clouds emerge as the result of the disruption of a more massive GMC,
rather than from the assembly of smaller clouds. Likewise in some cases, clouds
accrete onto more massive clouds rather than disperse. Because of the
difficulty of determining a precursor or successor of a given GMC, determining
GMC histories and lifetimes is highly non-trivial. Using a definition relating
to the continuous evolution of a cloud, we obtain lifetimes typically of 4-25
Myr for >10^5 M$_{\odot}$ GMCs, over which time the star formation efficiency
is about 1 %. We also relate the lifetime of GMCs to their crossing time. We
find that the crossing time is a reasonable measure of the actual lifetime of
the cloud, although there is considerable scatter. The scatter is found to be
unavoidable because of the complex and varied shapes and dynamics of the
clouds. We study cloud dispersal in detail and find both stellar feedback and
shear contribute to cloud disruption. We also demonstrate that GMCs do not
behave as ridge clouds, rather massive spiral arm GMCs evolve into smaller
clouds in inter-arm spurs.

spectroscopic members to identify 16 24um-bright sources within the cluster,
and measure their 24um star formation rates (SFRs) down to ~6 Msolar/year.
Based on their line-of-sight velocities and stellar ages, MIPS cluster members
appear to be an infalling population that was recently accreted from the field
with minimal environmental dependency on their star formation. However, we
identify a double-sequenced distribution of star-forming galaxies amongst the
members, with one branch exhibiting declining specific SFRs with mass. The
members along this sub-main sequence contain spectral features suggestive of
passive galaxies. Using caustic diagrams, we kinematically identify these
galaxies as a virialized and/or backsplash population. Moreover, we find a mix
of dynamical histories at all projected radii, indicating that standard
definitions of environment (i.e., radius and density) are contaminated with
recently accreted interlopers, which could contribute to a lack of
environmental trends for star-forming galaxies. A cleaner narrative of their
dynamical past begins to unfold when using a proxy for accretion histories
through profiles of constant (r/r_200)x(Delta v/sigma_v); galaxies accreted at
earlier times possess lower values of (r/r_200)x(Delta v/sigma_v) with minimal
contamination from the distinct infalling population. Therefore, adopting a
time-averaged definition for density (as traced by accretion histories) rather
than an instantaneous density yields a depressed specific SFR within the

This could result from neutral processes if the effective population size of

mutations, and affecting linked neutral sites, could reduce variability on the
Y chromosome. Here, using genome-wide analyses of X, Y, autosomal and

simulations, we show that low observed Y chromosome variability is not
consistent with a purely neutral model. Instead, we show that models of
purifying selection are consistent with observed Y diversity. Further, the
number of sites estimated to be under purifying selection greatly exceeds the
number of Y-linked coding sites, suggesting the importance of the highly
repetitive ampliconic regions. While we show that purifying selection removing
deleterious mutations can explain the low diversity on the Y chromosome, we
cannot exclude the possibility that positive selection acting on beneficial

interesting cosmology. The trispectrum of curvature fluctuations has features
which are quite distinctive with respect to their P(X,\phi) counterpart. We
also show that, despite an absent cubic Lagrangian in the full theory,
non-Gaussianities in this model cannot produce the combination a of small
bispectrum alongside with a large trispectrum. We further expand on this point
to draw a lesson on what having a symmetry in the full background independent
theory entails at the level of fluctuations and vice-versa.

an important role in nonmonotonic reasoning. In a coherence-based setting, we

disjunction. The lower and upper bounds coincide with some well known t-norms
and t-conorms: minimum, product, Lukasiewicz, and Hamacher t-norms and their
dual t-conorms. On this basis we obtain Quasi And and Quasi Or rules. These are
rules for which any finite family of conditional events p-entails the
associated quasi conjunction and quasi disjunction. We examine some cases of
logical dependencies, and we study the relations among coherence, inclusion for
conditional events, and p-entailment. We also consider the Or rule, where quasi
conjunction and quasi disjunction of premises coincide with the conclusion. We
analyze further aspects of quasi conjunction and quasi disjunction, by
computing probabilistic bounds on premises from bounds on conclusions. Finally,
we consider biconditional events, and we introduce the notion of an
$n$-conditional event. Then we give a probabilistic interpretation for a
generalized Loop rule. In an appendix we provide explicit expressions for the
Hamacher t-norm and t-conorm in the unitary hypercube.

nano-tracks have been shown to store data at high density, perform complex
logic operations, and mechanically manipulate magnetic beads. The magnetic
track has been a model system to study magnetic and magneto-electronic
phenomena, such as field induced DW propagation and spin-transfer torque. This
thesis focuses on DW manipulation and DW-based devices in spin-valve (SV)
tracks. In comparison to monolayer tracks, the SV track enables more sensitive
and versatile measurements, as well as an electronic output of DW-based
devices, of crucial interest to applications. However, these multi-layered
tracks add new, potentially disruptive magnetic interactions, as well as
fabrication challenges. In this thesis, the DW propagation in SV tracks of
different compositions was studied, and a system with DW propagation properties
comparable to the state-of-the-art in monolayer tracks was demonstrated, down
to an unprecedented lateral size of 33nm. Several logic devices were
demonstrated and studied, namely a turn-counting DW spiral, a DW gate, DW logic
NOT gates, and a DW-DW interactor. It was found that the magnetic behaviour of
these devices was analogous to that of monolayer structures, and the device
performance, as defined by the range of field wherein they function desirably,
was found to be comparable to that of monolayer systems. The interaction
between DWs in adjacent tracks was studied and new phenomena were
characterised, such as DW depinning induced by a static or travelling adjacent
DW. The contribution of different mechanisms to electrical current induced
depinning were quantified, and it was found that the Oersted field, negligible
in monolayer tracks, was responsible for large variations in depinning field in
SV tracks, and that the strength of spin-transfer effect was similar to that
reported in monolayer tracks.

analysis of the electronic structure of the simulated junctions reveals that
enhancement in the s-like states in Au MACs causes the increases in
conductance. Other structures also result in increased conductance but are too
short-lived to be detected in experiment, while MACs remain stable for long

is an emerging and exciting direction in quantum simulations. However,
simulations of such theories, compared to simulations of condensed matter
physics, must satisfy extra restrictions, such as local gauge and Lorentz
invariance. In this paper we discuss these special requirements, and present a
new method for quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories using ultracold
atoms. This method allows to include local gauge invariance as a fundamental
symmetry of the atomic Hamiltonian, arising from natural atomic interactions
and conservation laws (and not as a property of a low energy sector). This
allows us to implement elementary gauge invariant interactions for three
lattice gauge theories: compact QED (U(1)), SU(N) and Z_N, which can be used to
build quantum simulators in 1+1 dimensions. We also present a new loop method,
which uses the elementary interactions as building blocks in the effective
construction of quantum simulations for d+1 dimensional lattice gauge theories
(d>1), without having to use Gauss's law as a constraint, as in previous
proposals. We discuss in detail the quantum simulation of 2+1 dimensional
compact QED and provide a numerical proof of principle. The simplicity of the
already gauge invariant elementary interactions of this model suggests it may
be useful for future experimental realizations.

remained elusive. We hypothesized that environmental fluctuations between
seasons in a North American orchard would impose temporally variable selection
on Drosophila melanogaster and consequently maintain allelic variation at
polymorphisms adaptively evolving in response to climatic variation. We
identified hundreds of polymorphisms whose frequency oscillates among seasons
and argue that these loci are subject to strong, temporally variable selection.
We show that these polymorphisms respond to acute and persistent changes in
climate and are associated in predictable ways with seasonally variable
phenotypes. In addition, we show that adaptively oscillating polymorphisms are
likely millions of years old, with some likely predating the divergence between
D. melanogaster and D. simulans. Taken together, our results demonstrate that
rapid temporal fluctuations in climate over generational time promotes adaptive

non-linear turbulent regime, we quantify energy transfer on a scale-by-scale

developing the diagnostic known as spectral energy transfer function analysis.
At late times when the fluid is in a state of MHD turbulence, magnetic tension
mediates the dominant mode of energy injection into the magnetic reservoir,
whereby turbulent fluid motions twist and stretch the magnetic field lines.
This generated magnetic energy turbulently cascades to smaller scales, while
being exchanged backwards and forwards with the kinetic energy reservoir, until
finally being dissipated. Incorporating explicit dissipation pushes the
dissipation scale to larger scales than if the dissipation were entirely
numerical. For scales larger than the dissipation scale, we show that the
physics of energy transfer in decaying MHD turbulence is robust to numerical
effects.

solid state systems is generically a non-monotonic (oscillatory) function of
the applied field. This unexpected behavior can be understood as arising due to
a common path interference between two distinct tunneling solutions. The
phenomenon is insensitive to magnetic field, and arises whenever the low energy
dispersion relation contains higher order terms in addition to the usual $p^2$
term. Such higher order terms are generically present, albeit with small
co-efficient, so that the oscillatory Zener tunneling is a universal
phenomenon. However, the first `Zener oscillation' occurs at a transmission
probability which is exponentially small when the co-efficient of the higher
order terms is small. This explains why this oscillatory aspect of Zener
tunneling has been hitherto overlooked, despite its universality. The common
path interference is also destroyed by the presence of odd powers of $p$ in the
low energy dispersion relation. Since odd powers of $p$ are strictly absent
only when the tunneling barrier lies along an axis of mirror symmetry, it
follows that the robustness of the oscillatory behavior depends on the
orientation of the tunneling barrier. Bilayer graphene is identified as a
particularly good material for observation of common path interference, due to
its unusual nearly isotropic dispersion relation, where the $p^4$ term makes
the leading contribution.

core-collapse supernovae, especially for more massive stars, has led to
speculation concerning the observable transients that might be produced if such
a supernova fails. Even if a prompt outgoing shock fails to form in a
collapsing presupernova star, one must still consider the hydrodynamic response
of the star to the abrupt loss of mass via neutrinos as the core forms a
protoneutron star. Following a suggestion by Nadezhin (1980), we calculate the
hydrodynamical responses of typical supernova progenitor stars to the rapid
loss of approximately 0.2 to 0.5 M_sun of gravitational mass from their
centers. In a red supergiant star, a very weak supernova with total kinetic
energy ~ 10^47 erg results. The binding energy of a large fraction of the
hydrogen envelope before the explosion is of the same order and, depending upon
assumptions regarding the neutrino loss rates, most of it is ejected. Ejection
speeds are ~ 100 km/s and luminosities ~ 10^39 erg/s are maintained for about a
year. A significant part of the energy comes from the recombination of
hydrogen. The color of the explosion is extremely red and the events bear some
similarity to ""luminous red novae,"" but have much lower speeds.

context of a warped theory of flavor, which is theoretically very attractive,
this suggests Kaluza-Klein particle masses are likely to be above 10 TeV except
possibly for a radion. The interpretation of the SM-like Higgs from the
perspective of other interesting beyond the SM scenarios is also likely that
the relevant scale is higher than accessible to the LHC. In light of these
developments, deeper understanding of flavor and other fundamental issues
requires a gigantic international hadron collider [GIHC] perhaps with cm energy
of $\approx$ 100 TeV \cite{2talks}. It is suggested that a {\it global effort}
should be made for constructing this machine for resolving many questions that

C/C++, and runs on nVidia graphics cards. The peak performance of GRay using
single precision floating-point arithmetic on a single GPU exceeds 300 GFLOP
(or 1 nanosecond per photon per time step). For a realistic problem, where the
peak performance cannot be reached, GRay is two orders of magnitude faster than
existing CPU-based ray tracing codes. This performance enhancement allows more
effective searches of large parameter spaces when comparing theoretical
predictions of images, spectra, and lightcurves from the vicinities of compact
objects to observations. GRay can also perform on-the-fly ray tracing within
general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic algorithms that simulate accretion
flows around compact objects. Making use of this algorithm, we calculate the
properties of the shadows of Kerr black holes and the photon rings that
surround them. We also provide accurate fitting formulae of their dependencies
on black hole spin and observer inclination, which can be used to interpret
upcoming observations of the black holes at the center of the Milky Way, as

paradigm in which the growth is self-regulated by feedback from the black hole
itself. Here we use cosmological zoom simulations of galaxy formation down to z
= 2 to show that such strong self-regulation is required in the popular
spherical Bondi accretion model, but that a plausible alternative model in
which black hole growth is limited by galaxy-scale torques does not require
self-regulation. Instead, this torque-limited accretion model yields black
holes and galaxies evolving on average along the observed scaling relations by
relying only on a fixed, 5% mass retention rate onto the black hole from the
radius at which the accretion flow is fed. Feedback from the black hole may
(and likely does) occur, but does not need to couple to galaxy-scale gas in
order to regulate black hole growth. We show that this result is insensitive to
variations in the initial black hole mass, stellar feedback, or other
implementation details. The torque-limited model allows for high accretion
rates at very early epochs (unlike the Bondi case), which if viable can help
explain the rapid early growth of black holes, while by z = 2 it yields
Eddington factors of 1%-10%. This model also yields a less direct
correspondence between major merger events and rapid phases of black hole
growth. Instead, growth is more closely tied to cosmological disk feeding,
which may help explain observational studies showing that, at least at z > 1,
active galaxies do not preferentially show merger signatures.

instantaneously regulated by the mass of gas in a reservoir, links together
three different aspects of the evolving galaxy population:(a) the cosmic time
evolution of the specific star-formation rate sSFR relative to the growth of
haloes, (b) the gas-phase metallicities across the galaxy population and over
cosmic time, and (c) the ratio of the stellar to dark matter mass of haloes. If
the SFR efficiency and wind mass loading are constant, the sSFR is set to the
specific accretion rate of the galaxy: more realistic situations lead to an
sSFR which is perturbed from this identity. The metallicity is set by the
instantaneous operation of the regulator system rather than by the past history
of the system. The regulator system naturally produces a Z(mstar, SFR)
relation, with SFR as a second parameter in the mass-metallicity relation. This
will be the same at all epochs unless the efficiency and mass-loading change
with time, naturally producing a so-called ""fundamental metallicity relation"".
The observed Z(mstar) relation of SDSS galaxies implies a strong dependence of
stellar mass on halo mass that reconciles the different faint end slopes of the
stellar and halo mass-functions in standard {\Lambda}CDM. It also boosts the
sSFR relative to the specific accretion rate and produces a different
dependence on mass, both of which are observed. The derived Z(mstar, SFR)
relation for the regulator system is fit to published Z(mstar, SFR) data. The
fitted efficiency is consistent with observed molecular gas-depletion
timescales in galaxies while the fitted mass-loading is also plausible. The
model also successfully reproduces the mass-metallicity relation of
star-forming galaxies at z ~ 2.

below a certain scale, characterized by the dark matter particle mass, $m_{\rm

high-redshifts can set strong lower limits on $m_{\rm x}$. We place robust
constraints on $m_{\rm x}$ using recent results from the {\it Swift} database
of high-redshift gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We parameterize the redshift
evolution of the ratio between the cosmic GRB rate and star formation rate
(SFR) as $\propto (1+z)^\alpha$, thereby allowing astrophysical uncertainties
to partially mimic the cosmological suppression of structures in WDM models.
Using a maximum likelihood estimator on two different $z>4$ GRB subsamples
(including two bursts at $z>8$), we constrain $m_{\rm x} \gtrsim 1.6$-1.8 keV
at 95% C.L., when marginalized over a flat prior in $\alpha$. We further
estimate that 5 years of a SVOM-like mission would tighten these constraints to
$m_{\rm x} \gtrsim 2.3 $ keV. Our results show that GRBs are a powerful probe
of high-redshift structures, providing robust and competitive constraints on
$m_{\rm x}$.

subsequent evolution, was launched 14 May 2009 and has been scanning the
microwave and submillimetre sky continuously since 12 August 2009. This paper
gives an overview of the mission and its performance, the processing, analysis,
and characteristics of the data, the scientific results, and the science data
products and papers in the release. The science products include maps of the
CMB and diffuse extragalactic foregrounds, a catalogue of compact Galactic and
extragalactic sources, and a list of sources detected through the SZ effect.
The likelihood code used to assess cosmological models against the Planck data
and a lensing likelihood are described. Scientific results include robust
support for the standard six-parameter LCDM model of cosmology and improved
measurements of its parameters, including a highly significant deviation from
scale invariance of the primordial power spectrum. The Planck values for these
parameters and others derived from them are significantly different from those
previously determined. Several large-scale anomalies in the temperature
distribution of the CMB, first detected by WMAP, are confirmed with higher
confidence. Planck sets new limits on the number and mass of neutrinos, and has
measured gravitational lensing of CMB anisotropies at greater than 25 sigma.
Planck finds no evidence for non-Gaussianity in the CMB. Planck's results agree
well with results from the measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. Planck
finds a lower Hubble constant than found in some more local measures. Some
tension is also present between the amplitude of matter fluctuations derived
from CMB data and that derived from SZ data. The Planck and WMAP power spectra
are offset from each other by an average level of about 2% around the first
acoustic peak.

calibrated using the modulation induced on the mean temperature of the cosmic

simultaneous fitting of calibration parameters and sky maps. Noise properties
are estimated from time-ordered data after the sky signal has been removed,
using a generalized least square map-making algorithm. A destriping code

sky maps, minimizing the variance of correlated noise. Noise covariance

effects and of the tools and methods applied to assess residuals in maps and
power spectra. We also present an overall budget of known systematic effect
uncertainties, which are dominated sidelobe straylight pick-up and imperfect
calibration. However, even these two effects are at least two orders of
magnitude weaker than the cosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuations as
measured in terms of the angular temperature power spectrum. A residual signal
above the noise level is present in the multipole range $\ell<20$, most notably
at 30 GHz, and is likely caused by residual Galactic straylight contamination.
Current analysis aims to further reduce the level of spurious signals in the
data and to improve the systematic effects modelling, in particular with
respect to straylight and calibration uncertainties.

window functions and the associated uncertainties for the Planck Low Frequency
Instrument (LFI). Knowledge of the beam profiles is necessary for determining
the transfer function to go from the observed to the actual sky anisotropy
power spectrum. The main beam distortions affect the beam window function,
complicating the reconstruction of the anisotropy power spectrum at high
multipoles, whereas the sidelobes affect the low and intermediate multipoles.
The in-flight assessment of the LFI main beams relies on the measurements
performed during Jupiter observations. By stacking the data from multiple
Jupiter transits, the main beam profiles are measured down to -20 dB at 30 and
44 GHz, and down to -25 dB at 70 GHz. The main beam solid angles are determined
to better than 0.2% at each LFI frequency band. The Planck pre-launch optical
model is conveniently tuned to characterize the main beams independently of any
noise effects. This approach provides an optical model whose beams fully
reproduce the measurements in the main beam region, but also allows a
description of the beams at power levels lower than can be achieved by the
Jupiter measurements themselves. The agreement between the simulated beams and
the measured beams is better than 1% at each LFI frequency band. The simulated
beams are used for the computation of the window functions for the effective
beams. The error budget for the window functions is estimated from both main
beam and sidelobe contributions, and accounts for the radiometer bandshapes.
The total uncertainties in the effective beam window functions are: 2% and 1.2%
at 30 and 44 GHz, respectively (at $\ell \approx 600$), and 0.7% at 70 GHz (at
$\ell \approx 1000$).

acquired by the Low Frequency Instrument on Planck. Our calibration is based on
a combination of the Orbital Dipole plus the Solar Dipole, caused respectively
by the motion of the Planck spacecraft with respect to the Sun and by motion of
the Solar System with respect to the CMB rest frame. The latter provides a
signal of a few mK with the same spectrum as the CMB anisotropies and is
visible throughout the mission. In this data release we rely on the
characterization of the Solar Dipole as measured by WMAP. We also present
preliminary results (at 44GHz only) on the study of the Orbital Dipole, which
agree with the WMAP value of the Solar System speed within our uncertainties.
We compute the calibration constant for each radiometer roughly once per hour,
in order to keep track of changes in the detectors' gain. Since non-idealities
in the optical response of the beams proved to be important, we implemented a
fast convolution algorithm which considers the full beam response in estimating
the signal generated by the dipole. Moreover, in order to further reduce the
impact of residual systematics due to sidelobes, we estimated time variations
in the calibration constant of the 30GHz radiometers (the ones with the largest
sidelobes) using the signal of a reference load. We have estimated the
calibration accuracy in two ways: we have run a set of simulations to assess
the impact of statistical errors and systematic effects in the instrument and
in the calibration procedure, and we have performed a number of consistency
checks on the data and on the brightness temperature of Jupiter. Calibration
errors for this data release are expected to be about 0.6% at 44 and 70 GHz,
and 0.8% at 30 GHz. (Abriged.)

functions and the associated errors for the Planck HFI detectors. The effective
beam is the angular response including the effect of the optics,detectors,data
processing and the scan strategy. The window function is the representation of
this beam in the harmonic domain which is required to recover an unbiased
measurement of the CMB angular power spectrum. The HFI is a scanning instrument
and its effective beams are the convolution of: (a) the optical response of the
telescope and feeds;(b)the processing of the time-ordered data and
deconvolution of the bolometric and electronic time response; and (c) the
merging of several surveys to produce maps. The time response functions are
measured using observations of Jupiter and Saturn and by minimizing survey
difference residuals. The scanning beam is the post-deconvolution angular
response of the instrument, and is characterized with observations of Mars. The
main beam solid angles are determined to better than 0.5% at each HFI frequency
band. Observations of Jupiter and Saturn limit near sidelobes (within 5deg) to
about 0.1% of the total solid angle. Time response residuals remain as long
tails in the scanning beams, but contribute less than 0.1% of the total. The
bias and uncertainty in the beam products are estimated using ensembles of
simulated planet observations that include the impact of instrumental noise and
known systematic effects.The correlation structure of these ensembles is
well-described by five error eigenmodes that are sub-dominant to sample
variance and instrumental noise in the harmonic domain. A suite of consistency
tests provide confidence that the error model represents a sufficient
description of the data. The total error in the effective beam window functions
is below 1% at 100GHz up to ell~1500$,and below 0.5% at 143 and 217GHz up to
~2000.

data to produce photometrically calibrated maps. HFI observes the sky over a
broad range of frequencies, from 100 to 857 GHz. To get the best accuracy on
the calibration on such a large range, two different photometric calibration
schemes have to be used. The 545 and 857 \GHz\ data are calibrated using Uranus
and Neptune flux density measurements, compared with models of their
atmospheric emissions to calibrate the data. The lower frequencies (below 353
GHz) are calibrated using the cosmological microwave background dipole.One of
the components of this anisotropy results from the orbital motion of the
satellite in the Solar System, and is therefore time-variable. Photometric
calibration is thus tightly linked to mapmaking, which also addresses low
frequency noise removal. The 2013 released HFI data show some evidence for
apparent gain variations of the HFI bolometers' detection chain. These
variations were identified by comparing observations taken more than one year
apart in the same configuration. We developed an effective correction to limit
its effect on calibration, and assess its accuracy. We present several methods
used to estimate the precision of the photometric calibration. We distinguish
relative (from one detector to another, or from one frequency to another) and
absolute uncertainties. In both cases, we found that these uncertainties range
from a few $10^{-3}$ to several per cents from 100 to 857 GHz. We describe the
pipeline producing the maps from the HFI timelines, based on the photometric
calibration parameters and we detail the scheme used to a posteriori set the
zero level of the maps. We also briefly discuss the cross-calibration between
HFI and the SPIRE instrument on board Herschel. We finally summarize the basic
characteristics of the set of the HFI maps from the 2013 Planck data release.

  Planck data release",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201321531",,"astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Planck High Frequency Instrument (HFI) spectral response was determined
through a series of ground based tests conducted with the HFI focal plane in a
cryogenic environment prior to launch. The main goal of the spectral
transmission tests was to measure the relative spectral response (including
out-of-band signal rejection) of all HFI detectors. This was determined by
measuring the output of a continuously scanned Fourier transform spectrometer
coupled with all HFI detectors. As there is no on-board spectrometer within
HFI, the ground-based spectral response experiments provide the definitive data
set for the relative spectral calibration of the HFI. The spectral response of
the HFI is used in Planck data analysis and component separation, this includes
extraction of CO emission observed within Planck bands, dust emission,
Sunyaev-Zeldovich sources, and intensity to polarization leakage. The HFI
spectral response data have also been used to provide unit conversion and
colour correction analysis tools. Verifications of the HFI spectral response
data are provided through comparisons with photometric HFI flight data. This
validation includes use of HFI zodiacal emission observations to demonstrate
out-of-band spectral signal rejection better than 10^8. The accuracy of the HFI
relative spectral response data is verified through comparison with
complementary flight-data based unit conversion coefficients and colour
correction coefficients. These coefficients include those based upon HFI
observations of CO, dust, and Sunyaev-Zeldovich emission. General agreement is
observed between the ground-based spectral characterization of HFI and
corresponding in-flight observations, within the quoted uncertainty of each;
explanations are provided for any discrepancies.

resulting from interactions of high energy particles with the Planck High
Frequency Instrument (HFI). These interactions fall into two categories,
heating the 0.1 K bolometer plate and glitches in each detector time stream.
Glitch shapes are not simple single pole exponential decays and fall into a
three families. The glitch shape for each family has been characterized
empirically in flight data and removed from the detector time streams. The
spectrum of the count rate/unit energy is computed for each family and a
correspondence to where on the detector the particle hit is made. Most of the
detected glitches are from galactic protons incident on the Si die frame
supporting the micromachined bolometric detectors. At HFI, the particle flux is
~ 5 per square cm and per second and is dominated by protons incident on the
spacecraft with an energy >39 MeV, leading to a rate of typically one event per
second and per detector. Different categories of glitches have different
signature in timestreams. Two of the glitch types have a low amplitude
component that decays over nearly 1 second. This component produces an excess
noise if not properly removed from the time ordered data. We have used a glitch

templates. The application of this novel glitch removal method removes excess
noise from glitches. Using realistic simulations, we find this method does not
introduce signal bias.

between 30 and 857 GHz. These observations allow robust reconstruction of the
primordial cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature fluctuations over
nearly the full sky, as well as new constraints on Galactic foregrounds. This
paper describes the component separation framework adopted by Planck. We test
four foreground-cleaned CMB maps derived using qualitatively different
component separation algorithms. The quality of our reconstructions is
evaluated through detailed simulations and internal comparisons, and shown
through various tests to be internally consistent and robust for CMB power
spectrum and cosmological parameter estimation up to l = 2000. The parameter
constraints on LambdaCDM cosmologies derived from these maps are consistent
with those presented in the cross-spectrum based Planck likelihood analysis. We
choose two of the CMB maps for specific scientific goals. We also present maps
and frequency spectra of the Galactic low-frequency, CO, and thermal dust
emission. The component maps are found to provide a faithful representation of
the sky, as evaluated by simulations. For the low-frequency component, the
spectral index varies widely over the sky, ranging from about beta = -4 to -2.
Considering both morphology and prior knowledge of the low frequency
components, the index map allows us to associate a steep spectral index (beta <
-3.2) with strong anomalous microwave emission, corresponding to a spinning
dust spectrum peaking below 20 GHz, a flat index of beta > -2.3 with strong
free-free emission, and intermediate values with synchrotron emission.

astronomy and in particular in the study of star formation and the Galactic
structure. Although a wealth of data exists in the Galactic plane and some
well-known molecular clouds, there is no available CO high sensitivity all-sky
survey to date.
  Such all-sky surveys can be constructed using the \Planck\ HFI data because
the three lowest CO rotational transition lines at 115, 230 and 345 GHz
significantly contribute to the signal of the 100, 217 and 353 GHz HFI channels
respectively. Two different component separation methods are used to extract
the CO maps from Planck HFI data. The maps obtained are then compared to one
another and to existing external CO surveys. From these quality checks the best
CO maps in terms of signal to noise and/or residual foreground contamination
are selected. Three sets of velocity-integrated CO emission maps are produced:
Type 1 maps of the CO (1-0), (2-1), and (3-2) rotational transitions with low
foreground contamination but moderate signal-to-noise ratio; Type 2 maps for
the (1-0) and (2-1) transitions with a better signal-to-noise ratio; and one
Type 3 map, a line composite map with the best signal-to-noise ratio in order
to locate the faintest molecular regions. The maps are described in detail.
They are shown to be fully compatible with previous surveys of parts of the
Galactic Plane and also of fainter regions out of the Galactic plane. The
Planck HFI velocity-integrated CO maps for the (1-0), (2-1), and (3-2)
rotational transitions provide an unprecedented all-sky CO view of the Galaxy.
These maps are also of great interest to monitor potential CO contamination on
CMB \Planck\ studies.

30 GHz to 857 GHz. Planets, minor bodies, and diffuse interplanetary dust
emission (IPD) are all observed. The IPD can be separated from Galactic and
other emissions because Planck views a given point on the celestial sphere
multiple times, through different columns of IPD. We use the Planck data to
investigate the behaviour of zodiacal emission over the whole sky at
sub-millimetre and millimetre wavelengths. We fit the Planck data to find the
emissivities of the various components of the COBE zodiacal model -- a diffuse
cloud, three asteroidal dust bands, a circumsolar ring, and an Earth-trailing
feature. The emissivity of the diffuse cloud decreases with increasing
wavelength, as expected from earlier analyses. The emissivities of the dust
bands, however, decrease less rapidly, indicating that the properties of the
grains in the bands are different from those in the diffuse cloud. We fit the
small amount of Galactic emission seen through the telescope's far sidelobes,
and place limits on possible contamination of the CMB results from both
zodiacal and far-sidelobe emission. When necessary, the results are used in the
Planck pipeline to make maps with zodiacal emission and far sidelobes removed.
We show that the zodiacal correction to the CMB maps is small compared to the
Planck CMB temperature power spectrum and give a list of flux densities for
small Solar System bodies.

two-point correlation function of the CMB temperature fluctuations. We use this
likelihood to derive the Planck CMB power spectrum over three decades in l,
covering 2 <= l <= 2500. The main source of error at l <= 1500 is cosmic
variance. Uncertainties in small-scale foreground modelling and instrumental
noise dominate the error budget at higher l's. For l < 50, our likelihood
exploits all Planck frequency channels from 30 to 353 GHz through a physically
motivated Bayesian component separation technique. At l >= 50, we employ a
correlated Gaussian likelihood approximation based on angular cross-spectra
derived from the 100, 143 and 217 GHz channels. We validate our likelihood
through an extensive suite of consistency tests, and assess the impact of
residual foreground and instrumental uncertainties on cosmological parameters.
We find good internal agreement among the high-l cross-spectra with residuals
of a few uK^2 at l <= 1000. We compare our results with foreground-cleaned CMB
maps, and with cross-spectra derived from the 70 GHz Planck map, and find broad
agreement in terms of spectrum residuals and cosmological parameters. The
best-fit LCDM cosmology is in excellent agreement with preliminary Planck
polarisation spectra. The standard LCDM cosmology is well constrained by Planck
by l <= 1500. For example, we report a 5.4 sigma deviation from n_s /= 1.
Considering various extensions beyond the standard model, we find no indication
of significant departures from the LCDM framework. Finally, we report a tension
between the best-fit LCDM model and the low-l spectrum in the form of a power
deficit of 5-10% at l <~ 40, significant at 2.5-3 sigma. We do not elaborate
further on its cosmological implications, but note that this is our most
puzzling finding in an otherwise remarkably consistent dataset. (Abridged)

temperature and lensing-potential power spectra. The Planck spectra at high
multipoles are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flat
six-parameter LCDM cosmology. In this model Planck data determine the
cosmological parameters to high precision. We find a low value of the Hubble
constant, H0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/Mpc and a high value of the matter density
parameter, Omega_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreement
with constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including
curvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to
percent-level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We present results from an
analysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data sets
in addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are
favoured significantly over standard LCDM. The deviation of the scalar spectral
index from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes
in the matter content of the Universe. We find a 95% upper limit of r<0.11 on
the tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like
relativistic particles. Using BAO and CMB data, we find N_eff=3.30+/-0.27 for
the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of
0.23 eV for the summed neutrino mass. Our results are in excellent agreement
with big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of N_eff=3.046. We find no
evidence for dynamical dark energy. Despite the success of the standard LCDM
model, this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the CMB power spectrum at
low multipoles, as noted previously by the WMAP team. While not of decisive
significance, this is an anomaly in an otherwise self-consistent analysis of
the Planck temperature data.

gently perturbed by gravitational lensing. Here we present a detailed study of
this effect, detecting lensing independently in the 100, 143, and 217GHz
frequency bands with an overall significance of greater than 25sigma. We use
the temperature-gradient correlations induced by lensing to reconstruct a
(noisy) map of the CMB lensing potential, which provides an integrated measure
of the mass distribution back to the CMB last-scattering surface. Our lensing
potential map is significantly correlated with other tracers of mass, a fact
which we demonstrate using several representative tracers of large-scale
structure. We estimate the power spectrum of the lensing potential, finding
generally good agreement with expectations from the best-fitting LCDM model for
the Planck temperature power spectrum, showing that this measurement at z=1100
correctly predicts the properties of the lower-redshift, later-time structures
which source the lensing potential. When combined with the temperature power
spectrum, our measurement provides degeneracy-breaking power for parameter
constraints; it improves CMB-alone constraints on curvature by a factor of two
and also partly breaks the degeneracy between the amplitude of the primordial
perturbation power spectrum and the optical depth to reionization, allowing a
measurement of the optical depth to reionization which is independent of
large-scale polarization data. Discarding scale information, our measurement
corresponds to a 4% constraint on the amplitude of the lensing potential power
spectrum, or a 2% constraint on the RMS amplitude of matter fluctuations at
z~2.

both on the integrated history of star formation (via the cosmic infrared
background, or CIB) and on the distribution of dark matter (via the lensing
effect on the cosmic microwave background, or CMB). The conjunction of these
two unique probes allows us to measure directly the connection between dark and
luminous matter in the high redshift (1 < z <3) Universe. We use a three-point
statistic optimized to detect the correlation between these two tracers.
Following a thorough discussion of possible contaminants and a suite of
consistency tests, using lens reconstructions at 100, 143 and 217 GHz and CIB
measurements at 100-857 GHz, we report the first detection of the correlation
between the CIB and CMB lensing. The well matched redshift distribution of
these two signals leads to a detection significance with a peak value of 42
\sigma at 545 GHz and a correlation as high as 80% across these two tracers.
Our full set of multi-frequency measurements (both CIB auto- and CIB-lensing
cross-spectra) are consistent with a simple halo-based model, with a
characteristic mass scale for the halos hosting CIB sources of
log_{10}(M/M_sun) = 10.5 \pm 0.6. Leveraging the frequency dependence of our
signal, we isolate the high redshift contribution to the CIB, and constrain the
star formation rate (SFR) density at z>1. We measure directly the SFR density
with around 2 sigma significance for three redshift bins between z=1 and 7,
thus opening a new window into the study of the formation of stars at early
times.

presents the detection of the ISW effect, i.e., the correlation between the CMB
and large-scale evolving gravitational potentials. The significance of
detection ranges from 2 to 4 sigma, depending on which method is used. We
investigate three separate approaches, which cover essentially all previous
studies, as well as breaking new ground. (i) Correlation of the CMB with the
Planck reconstructed gravitational lensing potential (for the first time). This
detection is made using the lensing-induced bispectrum; the correlation between
lensing and the ISW effect has a significance close to 2.5 sigma. (ii)
Cross-correlation with tracers of LSS, yielding around 3 sigma significance,
based on a combination of radio (NVSS) and optical (SDSS) data. (iii) Aperture
photometry on stacked CMB fields at the locations of known large-scale
structures, which yields a 4 sigma signal when using a previously explored
catalogue, but shows strong discrepancies in amplitude and scale compared to
expectations. More recent catalogues give more moderate results, ranging from
negligible to 2.5 sigma at most, but with a more consistent scale and
amplitude, the latter being still slightly above what is expected from
numerical simulations within LCMD. Where they can be compared, these
measurements are compatible with previous work using data from WMAP, which had
already mapped these scales to the limits of cosmic variance. Planck's broader
frequency coverage confirms that the signal is achromatic, bolstering the case
for ISW detection. As a final step we use tracers of large-scale structure to
filter the CMB data, presenting maps of the ISW temperature perturbation. These
results provide complementary and independent evidence for the existence of a
dark energy component that governs the current accelerated expansion of the
Universe.

function of redshift for a sub-sample of 189 galaxy clusters from the Planck SZ
(PSZ) catalogue. The PSZ is selected through the signature of the
Sunyaev--Zeldovich (SZ) effect, and the sub-sample used here has a
signal-to-noise threshold of seven, with each object confirmed as a cluster and
all but one with a redshift estimate. We discuss the completeness of the sample
and our construction of a likelihood analysis. Using a relation between mass
$M$ and SZ signal $Y$ calibrated to X-ray measurements, we derive constraints
on the power spectrum amplitude $\sigma_8$ and matter density parameter
$\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ in a flat $\Lambda$CDM model. We test the robustness of
our estimates and find that possible biases in the $Y$--$M$ relation and the
halo mass function are larger than the statistical uncertainties from the
cluster sample. Assuming the X-ray determined mass to be biased low relative to
the true mass by between zero and 30%, motivated by comparison of the observed
mass scaling relations to those from a set of numerical simulations, we find
that $\sigma_8=0.75\pm 0.03$, $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}=0.29\pm 0.02$, and
$\sigma_8(\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3} = 0.764 \pm 0.025$. The value of
$\sigma_8$ is degenerate with the mass bias; if the latter is fixed to a value
of 20% we find $\sigma_8(\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3}=0.78\pm 0.01$ and a
tighter one-dimensional range $\sigma_8=0.77\pm 0.02$. We find that the larger
values of $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ preferred by Planck's
measurements of the primary CMB anisotropies can be accommodated by a mass bias
of about 40%. Alternatively, consistency with the primary CMB constraints can
be achieved by inclusion of processes that suppress power on small scales
relative to the $\Lambda$CDM model, such as a component of massive neutrinos
(abridged).

(tSZ) effect by applying specifically tailored component separation algorithms
to the 100 to 857 GHz frequency channel maps from the Planck survey. These maps
show an obvious galaxy cluster tSZ signal that is well matched with blindly
detected clusters in the Planck SZ catalogue. To characterize the signal in the
tSZ map we have computed its angular power spectrum.
  At large angular scales ($\ell < 60$), the major foreground contaminant is
the diffuse thermal dust emission. At small angular scales ($\ell > 500$) the
clustered Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) and residual point sources are the
major contaminants.
  These foregrounds are carefully modelled and subtracted.
  We measure the tSZ power spectrum in angular scales, $0.17^{\circ} \lesssim
\theta \lesssim 3.0^{\circ}$, that were previously unexplored. The measured tSZ
power spectrum is consistent with that expected from the Planck catalogue of SZ
sources, with additional clear evidence of signal from unresolved clusters and,
potentially, diffuse warm baryons.
  We use the tSZ power spectrum to obtain the following cosmological
constraints:
  $\sigma_8(\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.28)^{3.2/8.1}=0.784 \pm 0.016 (68% C.L.).
  Marginalized band-powers of the Planck tSZ power spectrum and the best-fit
model are given.
  The non-Gaussianity of the Compton parameter map is further characterized by
computing its 1D probability distribution function and its bispectrum. These
are used to place additional independent constraints on $\sigma_{8}$.

Planck nominal mission temperature anisotropy measurements, combined with the
WMAP large-angle polarization, constrain the scalar spectral index to $n_s =
0.9603 \pm 0.0073$, ruling out exact scale invariance at over 5 $\sigma$.
Planck establishes an upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r < 0.11
(95% CL). The Planck data thus shrink the space of allowed standard
inflationary models, preferring potentials with V"" < 0. Exponential potential
models, the simplest hybrid inflationary models, and monomial potential models
of degree n > 2 do not provide a good fit to the data. Planck does not find
statistically significant running of the scalar spectral index, obtaining $d
n_s/d ln k = -0.0134 \pm 0.0090$. Several analyses dropping the slow-roll
approximation are carried out, including detailed model comparison and
inflationary potential reconstruction. We also investigate whether the
primordial power spectrum contains any features. We find that models with a
parameterized oscillatory feature improve the fit $\chi^2$ by ~ 10; however,
Bayesian evidence does not prefer these models. We constrain several
single-field inflation models with generalized Lagrangians by combining power
spectrum data with bounds on $f_\mathrm{NL}$ measured by Planck. The fractional
primordial contribution of CDM isocurvature modes in the curvaton and axion
scenarios has upper bounds of 0.25% or 3.9% (95% CL), respectively. In models
with arbitrarily correlated CDM or neutrino isocurvature modes, an
anticorrelation can improve $\chi^2$ by approximatively 4 as a result of
slightly lowering the theoretical prediction for the $\ell<40$ multipoles
relative to the higher multipoles. Nonetheless, the data are consistent with
adiabatic initial conditions.

Accepted for publication in A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201321534",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The two fundamental assumptions of the standard cosmological model - that the
initial fluctuations are statistically isotropic and Gaussian - are rigorously
tested using maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy from the
Planck satellite. Deviations from isotropy have been found and demonstrated to
be robust against component separation algorithm, mask choice and frequency
dependence. Many of these anomalies were previously observed in the WMAP data,
and are now confirmed at similar levels of significance (about 3 sigma).
However, we find little evidence for non-Gaussianity, with the exception of a
few statistical signatures that seem to be associated with specific anomalies.
In particular, we find that the quadrupole-octopole alignment is also connected
to a low observed variance of the CMB signal. A power asymmetry is now found to
persist to scales corresponding to about l=600, and can be described in the
low-l regime by a phenomenological dipole modulation model. However, any
primordial power asymmetry is strongly scale-dependent and does not extend to
arbitrarily small angular scales. Finally, it is plausible that some of these
features may be reflected in the angular power spectrum of the data, which
shows a deficit of power on similar scales. Indeed, when the power spectra of
two hemispheres defined by a preferred direction are considered separately, one
shows evidence for a deficit in power, while its opposite contains oscillations
between odd and even modes that may be related to the parity violation and
phase correlations also detected in the data. Although these analyses represent
a step forward in building an understanding of the anomalies, a satisfactory
explanation based on physically motivated models is still lacking.

  Zacchei, A. Zonca","Planck 2013 Results. XXIV. Constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity","59 pages; LaTeX; 26 figures. This paper is one of a set associated
  with the 2013 data release from Planck. Updated version","A&A 571, A24 (2014)","10.1051/0004-6361/201321554",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Planck nominal mission cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps yield
unprecedented constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity (NG). Using three
optimal bispectrum estimators, separable template-fitting (KSW), binned, and
modal, we obtain consistent values for the primordial local, equilateral, and
orthogonal bispectrum amplitudes, quoting as our final result fNL^local=
2.7+/-5.8, fNL^equil= -42+/-75, and fNL^ortho= -25+\-39 (68% CL statistical).
NG is detected in the data; using skew-C_l statistics we find a nonzero
bispectrum from residual point sources, and the ISW-lensing bispectrum at a
level expected in the LambdaCDM scenario. The results are based on
comprehensive cross-validation of these estimators on Gaussian and non-Gaussian
simulations, are stable across component separation techniques, pass an
extensive suite of tests, and are confirmed by skew-C_l, wavelet bispectrum and
Minkowski functional estimators. Beyond estimates of individual shape
amplitudes, we present model-independent, 3-dimensional reconstructions of the
Planck CMB bispectrum and thus derive constraints on early-Universe scenarios
that generate primordial NG, including general single-field models of
inflation, excited initial states (non-Bunch-Davies vacua), and
directionally-dependent vector models. We provide an initial survey of
scale-dependent feature and resonance models. These results bound both general
single-field and multi-field model parameter ranges, such as the speed of
sound, c_s \geq 0.02 (95% CL), in an effective field theory parametrization,
and the curvaton decay fraction r_D \geq 0.15 (95% CL). The Planck data
significantly limit the viable parameter space of the ekpyrotic/cyclic
scenarios. The amplitude of the 4-point function in the local model tauNL <
2800 (95% CL). These constraints represent the highest precision tests to date
of physical mechanisms for the origin of cosmic structure.

strings and other defects. We describe forecasts of the CMB power spectrum
induced by cosmic strings, calculating these from network models and
simulations using line-of-sight Boltzmann solvers. We have studied Nambu-Goto
cosmic strings, as well as field theory strings for which radiative effects are
important, thus spanning the range of theoretical uncertainty in strings
models. We have added the angular power spectrum from strings to that for a
simple adiabatic model, with the extra fraction defined as $f_{10}$ at
multipole $\ell=10$. This parameter has been added to the standard six
parameter fit using COSMOMC with flat priors. For the Nambu-Goto string model,
we have obtained a constraint on the string tension of $G\mu/c^2 < 1.5 x
10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} < 0.015$ at 95% confidence that can be improved to
$G\mu/c^2 < 1.3 x 10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} < 0.010$ on inclusion of high-$\ell$ CMB
data. For the abelian-Higgs field theory model we find, $G\mu_{AH}/c^2 < 3.2 x
10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} < 0.028$. The marginalized likelihoods for $f_{10}$ and in
the $f_{10}$--$\Omega_b h^2$ plane are also presented. We have also obtained
constraints on $f_{10}$ for models with semi-local strings and global textures
for which $G\mu/c^2 < 1.1 x 10^{-6}$. We have made complementarity searches for
the specific non-Gaussian signatures of cosmic strings, calibrating with
all-sky Planck resolution CMB maps generated from networks of
post-recombination strings. We have obtained upper limits on the string tension
at 95% confidence of $G\mu/c^2 < 8.8 x 10^{-7}$ using modal bispectrum
estimation and $G\mu/c^2 < 7.8 x 10^{-7}$ for real space searches with
Minkowski functionals. These are conservative upper bounds because only
post-recombination string contributions have been included in the non-Gaussian
analysis.

homogeneity and isotropy. We search for topology with a fundamental domain
nearly intersecting the last scattering surface (comoving distance $\chi_r$).
For most topologies studied the likelihood maximized over orientation shows
some preference for multi-connected models just larger than $\chi_r$. This
effect is also present in simulated realizations of isotropic maps and we
interpret it as the alignment of mild anisotropic correlations with chance
features in a single realization; such a feature can also exist, in milder
form, when the likelihood is marginalized over orientations. Thus marginalized,
the limits on the radius $R_i$ of the largest sphere inscribed in a topological
domain (at log-likelihood-ratio -5) are: in a flat Universe, $R_i>0.9\chi_r$
for the cubic torus (cf. $R_i>0.9\chi_r$ at 99% CL for a matched-circles
search); $R_i>0.7\chi_r$ for the chimney; $R_i>0.5\chi_r$ for the slab; in a
positively curved Universe, $R_i>1.0\chi_r$ for the dodecahedron;
$R_i>1.0\chi_r$ for the truncated cube; $R_i>0.9\chi_r$ for the octahedron.
Similar limits apply to alternate topologies. We perform a Bayesian search for
an anisotropic Bianchi VII$_h$ geometry. In a non-physical setting where the
Bianchi parameters are decoupled from cosmology, Planck data favour a Bianchi
component with a Bayes factor of at least 1.5 units of log-evidence: a Bianchi
pattern is efficient at accounting for some large-scale anomalies in Planck
data. However, the cosmological parameters are in strong disagreement with
those found from CMB anisotropy data alone. In the physically motivated setting
where the Bianchi parameters are fitted simultaneously with standard
cosmological parameters, we find no evidence for a Bianchi VII$_h$ cosmology
and constrain the vorticity of such models: $(\omega/H)_0<8\times10^{-10}$ (95%
CL). [Abridged]

(CMB) generates a dipole temperature anisotropy on the sky which has been well
measured for more than 30 years, and has an accepted amplitude of v/c =
0.00123, or v = 369km/s. In addition to this signal generated by Doppler
boosting of the CMB monopole, our motion also modulates and aberrates the CMB
temperature fluctuations (as well as every other source of radiation at
cosmological distances). This is an order 0.1% effect applied to fluctuations
which are already one part in roughly one hundred thousand, so it is quite
small. Nevertheless, it becomes detectable with the all-sky coverage, high
angular resolution, and low noise levels of the Planck satellite. Here we
report a first measurement of this velocity signature using the aberration and
modulation effects on the CMB temperature anisotropies, finding a component in
the known dipole direction, (l,b)=(264, 48) [deg], of 384km/s +- 78km/s (stat.)
+- 115km/s (syst.). This is a significant confirmation of the expected
velocity.

detected in the first 15 months of Planck operations, the ""nominal"" mission. It
consists of nine single-frequency catalogues of compact sources, both Galactic
and extragalactic, detected over the entire sky. The PCCS covers the frequency
range 30--857\,GHz with higher sensitivity (it is 90% complete at 180 mJy in
the best channel) and better angular resolution (from ~33' to ~5') than
previous all-sky surveys in this frequency band. By construction its
reliability is >80% and more than 65% of the sources have been detected at
least in two contiguous Planck channels. In this paper we present the
construction and validation of the PCCS, its contents and its statistical

making it over six times the size of the Planck Early SZ (ESZ) sample and the

which 178 have been confirmed as clusters, mostly through follow-up
observations, and a further 683 are previously-known clusters. The remaining
366 have the status of cluster candidates, and we divide them into three
classes according to the quality of evidence that they are likely to be true
clusters. The Planck SZ catalogue is the deepest all-sky cluster catalogue,
with redshifts up to about one, and spans the broadest cluster mass range from
(0.1 to 1.6) 10^{15}Msun. Confirmation of cluster candidates through comparison
with existing surveys or cluster catalogues is extensively described, as is the
statistical characterization of the catalogue in terms of completeness and
statistical reliability. The outputs of the validation process are provided as
additional information. This gives, in particular, an ensemble of 813 cluster
redshifts, and for all these Planck clusters we also include a mass estimated
from a newly-proposed SZ-mass proxy. A refined measure of the SZ Compton
parameter for the clusters with X-ray counter-parts is provided, as is an X-ray
flux for all the Planck clusters not previously detected in X-ray surveys.

Clusters of galaxies (MCXC), we address the study of peculiar motions by
searching for evidence of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (kSZ). By
implementing various filters designed to extract the kSZ generated at the
positions of the clusters, we obtain consistent constraints on the radial
peculiar velocity average, root mean square (rms), and local bulk flow
amplitude at different depths. For the whole cluster sample of average redshift
0.18, the measured average radial peculiar velocity with respect to the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) radiation at that redshift, i.e., the kSZ monopole,
amounts to $72 \pm 60$ km s$^{-1}$. This constitutes less than 1% of the
relative Hubble velocity of the cluster sample with respect to our local CMB
frame. While the linear $\Lambda$CDM prediction for the typical cluster radial
velocity rms at $z=0.15$ is close to 230km s$^{-1}$, the upper limit imposed by
\Planck\ data on the cluster subsample corresponds to 800 km s$^{-1}$ at 95%
confidence level, i.e., about three times higher. \Planck\ data also set strong
constraints on the local bulk flow in volumes centred on the Local Group. There
is no detection of bulk flow as measured in any comoving sphere extending to
the maximum redshift covered by the cluster sample. A blind search for bulk
flows in this sample has an upper limit of 254 km s$^{-1}$ (95% confidence
level) dominated by CMB confusion and instrumental noise, indicating that the
Universe is largely homogeneous on Gpc scales. In this context, in conjunction
with supernova observations, \Planck\ is able to rule out a large class of
inhomogeneous void models as alternatives to dark energy or modified gravity.
The \Planck\ constraints on peculiar velocities and bulk flows are thus
consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM scenario.

the faintest of the four well-known Trapezium stars at the heart of the Orion
Nebula. The primary is a B3 star (~6Msun) but the nature of the secondary
(~2Msun) has long been mysterious, since the duration and shape of primary
eclipse are inappropriate for ordinary stars. Here we report nearly continuous
photometric observations obtained with the MOST satellite over ~4 cycles of the
6.47d binary period. The light curve is of unprecedented quality, revealing a
deep, symmetric primary eclipse as well as a clear reflection effect and
secondary eclipse. In addition, there are other small disturbances, some of
which repeat at the same phase over the four cycles monitored. The shape of the
primary light curve has clearly evolved significantly over the past 40 yr.
While its overall duration and depth have remained roughly constant, the slopes
of the descent and ascent phases are significantly shallower now than in the
past and its distinctive flat-bottomed ""pseudo-totality"" is much less obvious
or even absent in the most recent data. We further demonstrate that the primary
eclipse was detected at X-ray wavelengths during the Chandra COUP study. The
light curve continues to be well modeled by a self-luminous and reflective
disk-shaped object seen nearly edge-on orbiting the primary. The dramatic
change in shape over four decades is modeled as an opacity variation in a
tenuous outer envelope or disk of the secondary object. We presume that the
secondary is an extremely young protostar at an earlier evolutionary phase than
can be commonly observed elsewhere in the Galaxy and that the opacity
variations observed are related to its digestion of some accreted matter over
the last 50-100 yr. Indeed, this object deserves continued observational and
theoretical attention as the youngest known eclipsing binary system.

temperature is extended to predict conditions in which the temperature
variation significantly affects surface roughness scaling. It agrees with
computer simulation results for deposition of up to ${10}^4$ atomic layers and
maximal temperature changes of $30 K$, near or below the room temperature. If
the temperature decreases during the growth, the global roughness may have a
rapid growth, with effective exponents larger than 1/2 due to the
time-decreasing adatom mobility. The local roughness in small box size shows
typical evidence of anomalous scaling, with anomaly exponents depending on the
particular form of temperature decrease. If the temperature increases during
the growth, a non-monotonic evolution of the global roughness may be observed,
which is explained by the competition of kinetic roughening and the smoothing
effect of increasing diffusion lengths. The extension of the theoretical
approach to film deposition with other activation energy barriers shows that
similar conditions on temperature variation may lead to the same morphological
features. Equivalent results may also be observed by controlling the deposition
flux.

observing strong variations of the magnetic field and solar wind parameters in

present strong intensity fluctuations. Several works suggested that the
fluctuations might be attributed to spatial variations within the heliosheath.
Additionally, the variability of the solar wind in this region is caused by
different temporal events that occur near the Sun and propagate to the outer
heliosphere. To understand the spatial and temporal effects in the heliosheath,
it is important to study these effects separately. In this work we explore the
role of shocks as one type of temporal effects in the dynamics of the
heliosheath. Although currently plasma in the heliosheath is dominated by solar
minima conditions, with increasing solar cycle shocks associated with
transients will play an important role. We used a 3D MHD multi-fluid model of
the interaction between the solar wind and the local interstellar medium to
study the propagation of a pair of forward-reverse shocks in the supersonic
solar wind, interaction with the TS, and propagation to the heliosheath. We
found that in the supersonic solar wind the interaction region between the
shocks expands, the shocks weaken and decelerate. The fluctuation amplitudes of
the plasma parameters vary with heliocentric distance. The interaction of the
pair of shocks with the TS creates a variety of new waves and discontinuities
in the heliosheath, which produce a highly variable solar wind flow. The
collision of the forward shock with the heliopause causes a reflection of fast
magnetosonic waves inside the heliosheath.

problems. Given two sets of data from distinct physical models, the main
objective is to obtain a unified characterization of inclusions within the
spatial domain of the physical properties to be reconstructed. Although our
proposed method generally applies to many types of inversion problems, the main
motivation here is to characterize subsurface contaminant source-zones by
processing down gradient hydrological data and cross-gradient electrical
resistance tomography (ERT) observations. Inspired by Newton's method for
multi-objective optimization, we present an iterative inversion scheme that
suggests taking descent steps that can simultaneously reduce both data-model
misfit terms. Such an approach, however, requires solving a non-smooth convex
problem at every iteration, which is computationally expensive for a
pixel-based inversion over the whole domain. Instead, we employ a parametric
level set (PaLS) technique that substantially reduces the number of underlying
parameters, making the inversion computationally tractable. The performance of
the technique is examined and discussed through the reconstruction of source
zone architectures that are representative of dense non-aqueous phase liquid
(DNAPL) contaminant release in a statistically homogenous sandy aquifer. In
these examples, the geometric configuration of the DNAPL mass is considered
along with additional information about its spatial variability within the
contaminated zone, such as the identification of low and high saturation
regions. Comparison of the reconstructions with the true DNAPL architectures
highlights the superior performance of the model-based technique and joint
inversion scheme.

non-trivial Bell-diagonal states under simple Markovian channels, these are new
features that are in contrast with the Schatten 2-norm (Hilbert-Schmidt)
geometric discord. The necessary and sufficient conditions for double sudden
changes as well as their exact locations in terms of decoherence probabilities

the number of spikes per burst: As the stimulus varies, so does the length of
individual bursts. The represented stimuli, however, vary substantially among
different sensory modalities and different neurons. The goal of this paper is
to determine which kind of stimulus features can be encoded in burst length,
and how those features depend on the mathematical properties of the underlying
dynamical system. We show that the initiation and termination of each burst is
triggered by specific stimulus features whose temporal characteristsics are
determined by the types of bifurcations that initiate and terminate firing in
each burst. As only a few bifurcations are possible, only a restricted number
of encoded features exists. Here we focus specifically on describing parabolic,
square-wave and elliptic bursters. We find that parabolic bursters, whose
firing is initiated and terminated by saddle-node bifurcations, behave as
prototypical integrators: Firing is triggered by depolarizing stimuli, and
lasts for as long as excitation is prolonged. Elliptic bursters, contrastingly,
constitute prototypical resonators, since both the initiating and terminating
bifurcations possess well-defined oscillation time scales. Firing is therefore
triggered by stimulus stretches of matching frequency and terminated by a
phase-inversion in the oscillation. The behavior of square-wave bursters is
somewhat intermediate, since they are triggered by a fold bifurcation of cycles
of well-defined frequency but are terminated by a homoclinic bifurcation
lacking an oscillating time scale. These correspondences show that stimulus
selectivity is determined by the type of bifurcations. We also demonstrate that
additional biological properties that do not modify the bifurcation structure
play a minor role in stimulus encoding.

algebraic framework allowing to describe functions and / or distributions via a
kind of ""jet"" or local Taylor expansion around each point. The main novel idea
is to replace the classical polynomial model which is suitable for describing
smooth functions by arbitrary models that are purpose-built for the problem at
hand. In particular, this allows to describe the local behaviour not only of
functions but also of large classes of distributions.
  We then build a calculus allowing to perform the various operations
(multiplication, composition with smooth functions, integration against
singular kernels) necessary to formulate fixed point equations for a very large
class of semilinear PDEs driven by some very singular (typically random) input.
This allows, for the first time, to give a mathematically rigorous meaning to
many interesting stochastic PDEs arising in physics. The theory comes with
convergence results that allow to interpret the solutions obtained in this way
as limits of classical solutions to regularised problems, possibly modified by
the addition of diverging counterterms. These counterterms arise naturally
through the action of a ""renormalisation group"" which is defined canonically in
terms of the regularity structure associated to the given class of PDEs.
  As an example of a novel application, we solve the long-standing problem of
building a natural Markov process that is symmetric with respect to the (finite
volume) measure describing the $\Phi^4_3$ Euclidean quantum field theory. It is
natural to conjecture that the Markov process built in this way describes the
Glauber dynamic of 3-dimensional ferromagnets near their critical temperature.

separation is suppressed and gives way to a microemulsion-type state that
contains nanometer size lo domains in a ld environment. Furthermore, we
introduce a mechanism that generates rafts of finite size by a coupling between
monolayer curvature and local composition. We show that mismatch between the
spontaneous curvatures of monolayers in the lo and ld phase induces elastic
interactions, which reduce the line tension between the lo and ld phase and can
stabilize raft domains with a characteristic size of the order of a few
nanometers. Our findings suggest that rafts in multicomponent bilayers might be
closely related to the modulated ripple phase in one-component bilayers.

it optimally stores data based on how often the characters occur in Huffman
trees. An $n$-ary Huffman tree is a connected, cycle-lacking graph where each
vertex can have either $n$ ""children"" vertices connecting to it, or 0 children.
Vertices with 0 children are called \textit{leaves}. We let $h_n(q)$ represent
the total number of $n$-ary Huffman trees with $q$ leaves. In this paper, we
use a recursive method to generate upper and lower bounds on $h_n(q)$ and get
$h_2(q) \approx (0.1418532)(1.7941471)^q+(0.0612410)(1.2795491)^q$ for $n=2$.
This matches the best results achieved by Elsholtz, Heuberger, and Prodinger in
August 2011. Our approach reveals patterns in Huffman trees that we used in our
analysis of the Binary-Ternary (BT) trees we created. Our research opens a
completely new door in data compression by extending the study of Huffman trees
to BT trees. Our study of BT trees paves the way for designing data-specific
trees, minimizing possible wasted storage space from Huffman coding. We prove a
recursive formula for the number of BT trees with $q$ leaves. Furthermore, we
provide analysis and further proofs to reach numeric bounds. Our discoveries
have broad applications in computer data compression. These results also
improve graphical representations of protein sequences that facilitate in-depth
genome analysis used in researching evolutionary patterns.

distributions for three dimensional disordered conductors. However, there are
two major criticisms of the derivation of the Generalized DMPK equation: (1)
certain eigenvector correlations were neglected based on qualitative arguments
that can not be valid for all disorder, and (2) the repulsion between two
closely spaced eigenvalues were not rigorously governed by symmetry
considerations. In this work we show that it is possible to address both
criticisms by including the eigenvalue and eigenvector correlations in a
systematic and controlled way. It turns out that the added correlations
determine the evolution of the Jacobian, without affecting the evaluation of
the conductance distributions. They also guarantee the symmetry requirements.
In addition, we obtain an exact relationship between the eigenvectors and the
Lyapunov exponents leading to a sum rule for the latter at all disorder.

is expected to release its first data set in the near future. For the first
time in the CMB history, extensive measurements of the CMB polarization will be
made available for the entire sky. Such precise and rich data are expected to
contain a great wealth of information about the Universe. The information in
the CMB data is conveniently represented in terms of angular power spectra for
temperature and polarization. A proper estimation of these CMB power spectra
from data is the first step in making inferences about the Universe and, in
particular, cosmological parameters that govern the Universe. In this paper, we
provide forecasts for the $TT$, $EE$, and $TE$ angular power spectra for the
Planck mission. Our forecasts are made using synthetic data based on the
best-fit $\Lambda$CDM model while conforming to the characteristics and
parameters of the Planck mission. We have analysed such synthetic data sets
using a nonparametric function estimation formalism that is otherwise
asymptotically model-independent. Indeed, the power spectra estimated from such
synthetic data turn out to be sufficiently close to the corresponding
$\Lambda$CDM spectra. Our analysis further indicates that the three angular
power spectra are determined sufficiently well for $2 \le l \lesssim l_{max}$,
where $l_{max} = 2500 {($TT$),} 1377 {($EE$), and} 1727 {($TE$)}$ respectively.

models corresponding to a single set of variables under several distinct
conditions. This problem is motivated by the task of recovering transcriptional
regulatory networks on the basis of gene expression data {containing
heterogeneous samples, such as different disease states, multiple species, or
different developmental stages}. We assume that most aspects of the conditional
dependence networks are shared, but that there are some structured differences
between them. Rather than assuming that similarities and differences between
networks are driven by individual edges, we take a node-based approach, which
in many cases provides a more intuitive interpretation of the network
differences. We consider estimation under two distinct assumptions: (1)
differences between the K networks are due to individual nodes that are
perturbed across conditions, or (2) similarities among the K networks are due
to the presence of common hub nodes that are shared across all K networks.
Using a row-column overlap norm penalty function, we formulate two convex
optimization problems that correspond to these two assumptions. We solve these
problems using an alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm, and we
derive a set of necessary and sufficient conditions that allows us to decompose
the problem into independent subproblems so that our algorithm can be scaled to
high-dimensional settings. Our proposal is illustrated on synthetic data, a
webpage data set, and a brain cancer gene expression data set.

indicate the presence of an extra correction which enlarges the 2S-2P energy
gap in muonic hydrogen. Here we explore the possibility of large extra
dimensions which could modify the Newtonian gravity at small scales and lower
the 2S state energy while leaving the 2P state nearly unchanged. We find that
such effect could be produced by four or more large extra dimensions which are
allowed by the current constraints from low energy physics.

(IPS) at 327 MHz, and in-situ observations. In this study, we analyze solar
wind disturbance factor (g-value) data derived from IPS observations during
1997-2009 covering nearly the whole period of Solar Cycle 23. By comparing
observations from the SOHO/LASCO, IPS, and in situ, we then identify 39 ICMEs
that could be analyzed carefully. Here, we define two speeds V_SOHO and V_bg,
which are initial speed of ICME and the speed of the background solar wind,
respectively. Examinations of these speeds yield the following results; i) Fast
ICMEs (with V_SOHO - V_bg > 500 km/s) rapidly decelerate, moderate ICMEs (with
0 km/s < V_SOHO - V_bg < 500 km/s) show either gradually decelerating or
uniform motion, and slow ICMEs (with V_SOHO - V_bg < 0 km/s) accelerate. The
radial speeds converge on the speed of background solar wind during their
outward propagation. We subsequently find; ii) both the acceleration and
deceleration are nearly complete by 0.79 (+/- 0.04) AU, and those are ended
when the ICME speed reaches a given speed. We find the value of that to be 480
(+/- 21) km/s. iii) For the fast and moderate ICMEs, a linear equation with a
constant coefficient is more appropriate than a quadratic equation to describe
their kinematics, because the chi-square for the linear equation satisfies the
statistical significance level of 0.05, while the quadratic one is not. These
results support the hypothesis that the radial motion of ICMEs is governed by a
drag force due to interaction with the background solar wind. These findings

provides enhanced physical layer security in multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) wiretap channels. The practical passive eavesdropping scenario we
consider is where channel state information (CSI) from the eavesdropper is not
available at the transmitter. Our new scheme is carried out in two steps.
First, the transmitter selects the first two strongest antennas based on the
feedback from the receiver, which maximizes the instantaneous signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) of the transmitter-receiver channel. Second, the Alamouti scheme is
employed at the selected antennas in order to perform data transmission. At the
receiver and the eavesdropper, maximal-ratio combining is applied in order to
exploit the multiple antennas.We derive a new closed-form expression for the
secrecy outage probability in nonidentical Rayleigh fading, and using this
result, we then present the probability of non-zero secrecy capacity in closed
form and the {\epsilon}-outage secrecy capacity in numerical form. We
demonstrate that our proposed TAS-Alamouti scheme offers lower secrecy outage
probability than a single TAS scheme when the SNR of the transmitter-receiver
channel is above a specific value.

is the absence of conventional radiation and matter-dominated critical points
in the phase space of the model. This entails that radiation and matter
dominance are not generic solutions of the cosmological equations, so that
these stages can be implemented only by means of unique and very specific
initial conditions, i. e., of very unstable particular solutions. Such a
behavior is in marked contradiction with the accepted cosmological paradigm
which requires of an earlier stage dominated by relativistic species, followed
by a period of conventional non-relativistic matter domination, during which
the cosmic structure we see was formed. Also, we found that the bulk viscosity
is positive just until very late times in the cosmic evolution, around z < 1.
For earlier epochs it is negative, been in tension with the local second law of

The Lattice Boltzmann method is applied in order to ascertain the role of
surface reaction and subsequent deformation of a single capillary in 2D for the
linear Washburn behavior. The proposed investigation is motivated by the
problem of reactive infiltration of molten silicon into carbon preforms. This
is a complex phenomenon arising from the interplay between fluid flow, the
transition to wetting, surface growth and heat transfer. Furthermore, it is
characterized by slow infiltration velocities in narrow interstices resulting
in small Reynolds numbers that are difficult to reproduce with a single
capillary. In our simulations, several geometric characteristics for the
capillaries are considered, as well as different infiltration and reaction
conditions. The main result of our work is that the phenomenon of pore closure
can be regarded as independent of the infiltration velocity, and in turn a
number of other parameters. The instrumental conclusion drawn from our
simulations is that short pores with wide openings and a round-shaped
morphology near the throats represent the optimal configuration for the
underlying structure of the porous preform in order to achieve faster
infiltration. The role of the approximations is discussed in detail and the
robustness of our findings is assessed.

construct a procedure with a risk as close as possible to the risk of the best

theory (2004) Paris 6, Statistical Learning Theory and Stochastic Optimization

exponential weights (AEW), defined by \[\tilde{f}^{\mathrm{AEW}}=\sum_{f\in

\hat{\theta}(f)=\frac{\exp(-({n}/{T})R_n(f))}{\sum_{g\in

and $R_n(\cdot)$ is an empirical risk. In this article, we study the optimality
of the AEW in the regression model with random design and in the
low-temperature regime. We prove three properties of AEW. First, we show that
AEW is a suboptimal aggregation procedure in expectation with respect to the
quadratic risk when $T\leq c_1$, where $c_1$ is an absolute positive constant
(the low-temperature regime), and that it is suboptimal in probability even for
high temperatures. Second, we show that as the cardinality of the dictionary
grows, the behavior of AEW might deteriorate, namely, that in the
low-temperature regime it might concentrate with high probability around
elements in the dictionary with risk greater than the risk of the best function
in the dictionary by at least an order of $1/\sqrt{n}$. Third, we prove that if
a geometric condition on the dictionary (the so-called ""Bernstein condition) is
assumed, then AEW is indeed optimal both in high probability and in expectation
in the low-temperature regime. Moreover, under that assumption, the complexity
term is essentially the logarithm of the cardinality of the set of ""almost
minimizers"" rather than the logarithm of the cardinality of the entire
dictionary. This result holds for small values of the temperature parameter,
thus complementing an analogous result for high temperatures.

frequency, $\vartheta = (\nu/\nu_0)^k+\vartheta_0$, which has not yet well
explained in previous works. We study this frequency dependence of beam radius
(FDB) for cone-dominant pulsars by using the curvature radiation mechanism.
Considering various density and energy distributions of particles in the pulsar
open field line region, we numerically simulate the emission intensity
distribution across emission height and rotation phase, and get integrated
profiles at different frequencies and obtain the FDB curves. For the density
model of a conal-like distribution, the simulated profiles always shrink to one
component at high frequencies. In the density model with two separated density
patches, the profiles always have two distinct components, and the power-law
indices $k$ are found to be in the range from -0.1 to -2.5, consistent with
observational results. Energy distributions of streaming particles have
significant influence on the frequency-dependence behavior. Radial energy decay
of particles are necessary to get proper $\vartheta_0$ in models. We conclude
that by using the curvature radiation mechanism, the observed frequency
dependence of beam radius for the cone-dominant pulsars can only be explained
by the emission model of particles in two density patches with a Gaussian
energy distribution and a radial energy loss.

effectively controlled by the relative strength of the laser fields and the
relative width of the single decaying level. We also extend the idea to the
higher-ordered multiplet spectroscopy by increasing the number of energy levels

is only sustainable within a very narrow pressure range (a few GPa) and is
readily destroyed upon further compression. Here we report high-pressure
magnetic susceptibility and structure measurements on a newly discovered
superconductor, LaPhenanthrene. It is found that the application of pressure
not only significantly increases $T_{C}$ from its ambient-pressure value of 4.8
K to 12.3 K at 18.4 GPa but also stabilizes the high $T_{C}$ over the entire
pressure range (61 GPa) of the study. The evolution of $T_{C}$ with pressure is
closely correlated with the angle $\beta$ of the monoclinic unit cell. Both
$T_{C}$ and $\beta$ change sharply with increasing pressure initially but
remain constant above 40 GPa, indicating that molecule orientation is essential
to superconductivity. These behaviors can be understood in terms of pressure

~0.5 M_SUN in a large sample of clusters using both archival and proprietary U,
B, V, and I data from ground-based telescopes. In this paper, we focus on the
occurrence of multiple stellar populations in twenty three clusters. We have
defined a new photometric index cubi= (U-B)-(B-I), that turns out to be very
effective for identifying multiple sequences along the red giant branch (RGB).
We found that in the V-cubi diagram all clusters presented in this paper show
broadened or multimodal RGBs, with the presence of two or more components. We
found a direct connection with the chemical properties of different sequences,
that display different abundances of light elements (O, Na, C, N, and Al). The
cubi index is also a powerful tool to identify distinct sequences of stars
along the horizontal branch and, for the first time in the case of NGC104 (47
Tuc), along the asymptotic giant branch. Our results demonstrate that i) the
presence of more than two stellar populations is a common feature among
globular clusters, as already highlighted in previous work; ii) multiple
sequences with different chemical contents can be easily identified by using
standard Johnson photometry obtained with ground-based facilities; iii) in the
study of GC multiple stellar populations the cubi index is alternative to
spectroscopy, and has the advantage of larger statistics.

  Predictive Control",,,,,"cs.SY math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This contribution considers one central aspect of experiment design in system
identification. When a control design is based on an estimated model, the
achievable performance is related to the quality of the estimate. The
degradation in control performance due to errors in the estimated model is
measured by an application cost function. In order to use an optimization based
input design method, a convex approximation of the set of models that atisfies
the control specification is required. The standard approach is to use a
quadratic approximation of the application cost function, where the main
computational effort is to find the corresponding Hessian matrix. Our main
contribution is an alternative approach for this problem, which uses the
structure of the underlying optimal control problem to considerably reduce the
computations needed to find the application set. This technique allows the use
of applications oriented input design for MPC on much more complex plants. The
approach is numerically evaluated on a distillation control problem.

star-forming regions in our Galaxy and shows strong feedback from the high
massive stars. We use our Herschel FIR observations to study the properties of
the clouds over the entire area of the CNC. The good angular resolution of the
Herschel maps corresponds to physical scales of 0.1 - 0.4 pc, and allows us to
analyze the small-scale structures of the clouds. The full extent of the CNC
was mapped with PACS and SPIRE from 70 to 500 micron. We determine temperatures
and column densities at each point in this maps by modeling the observed FIR
SEDs. We also derive a map showing the strength of the UV field. We investigate
the relation between the cloud properties and the spatial distribution of the
high-mass stars, and compute total cloud masses for different density
thresholds. Our Herschel maps resolve, for the first time, the small-scale
structure of the dense clouds. Several particularly interesting regions,
including the prominent pillars south of eta Car, are analyzed in detail. We
compare the cloud masses derived from the Herschel data to previous mass
estimates based on sub-mm and molecular line data. Our maps also reveal a
peculiar ""wave""-like pattern in the northern part of the Carina Nebula.
Finally, we characterize two prominent cloud complexes at the periphery of our
Herschel maps, which are probably molecular clouds in the Galactic background.
We find that the density and temperature structure of the clouds in most parts
of the CNC is dominated by the strong feedback from the numerous massive stars,
rather than random turbulence. Comparing the cloud mass and the star formation
rate derived for the CNC to other Galactic star forming regions suggests that
the CNC is forming stars in an particularly efficient way. We suggest this to
be a consequence of triggered star formation by radiative cloud compression.

essentially depends on the form of the area. If the bottom of the potential
well has a potential relief, it can define the small eigenvalues as the
discrete levels. In this case, dimensions and form of the area would not have
any importance. If the conservation of zero value of the angular momentum is
taken into account, the effective one-particle Hamiltonian for the 2D electron
gas in the magnetic field in the circle is the Hamiltonian with the parabolic
potential and the reflecting bounds. It is supposed that in the square, the
Hamiltonian has the same view. The 2D density of states in the square can be

density of states is a continuous function. The Fermi energy dependence on the

partitioning step two pivots are used to split the input into three segments.
This can be done in different ways, giving rise to different algorithms.
Recently, a dual-pivot algorithm proposed by Yaroslavskiy received much
attention, because a variant of it replaced the well-engineered quicksort
algorithm in Sun's Java 7 runtime library. Nebel and Wild (ESA 2012) analyzed
this algorithm and showed that on average it uses 1.9n ln n + O(n) comparisons
to sort an input of size n, beating standard quicksort, which uses 2n ln n +
O(n) comparisons. We introduce a model that captures all dual-pivot algorithms,
give a unified analysis, and identify new dual-pivot algorithms that minimize
the average number of key comparisons among all possible algorithms up to a
linear term. This minimum is 1.8n ln n + O(n). For the case that the pivots are
chosen from a small sample, we include a comparison of dual-pivot quicksort and
classical quicksort. Specifically, we show that dual-pivot quicksort benefits
from a skewed choice of pivots. We experimentally evaluate our algorithms and

microsimulation. The technique results in non-integer weights for individual
rows of data. This is problematic for certain applications and has led many
researchers to favour combinatorial optimisation approaches such as simulated
annealing. An alternative to this is `integerisation' of IPF weights: the
translation of the continuous weight variable into a discrete number of unique
or `cloned' individuals. We describe four existing methods of integerisation
and present a new one. Our method --- `truncate, replicate, sample' (TRS) ---
recognises that IPF weights consist of both `replication weights' and
`conventional weights', the effects of which need to be separated. The
procedure consists of three steps: 1) separate replication and conventional
weights by truncation; 2) replication of individuals with positive integer
weights; and 3) probabilistic sampling. The results, which are reproducible
using supplementary code and data published alongside this paper, show that TRS
is fast, and more accurate than alternative approaches to integerisation.

relevant to extend this study up to the critical temperature for the loss of
the superfluid phase, such that the size of the vortex increases without bound.
To this end, two novel techniques are introduced. The first one solves the BdG

high accuracy how the vortex profile matches its asymptotic value at a large
distance from the center, thus avoiding a common practice of constraining the
vortex in a cylinder with infinite walls. The second one improves on the
regularization procedure of the self-consistent gap equation when the
inter-particle interaction is of the contact type, and permits to considerably
reduce the time needed for its numerical integration, by drawing elements from
the derivation of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for composite bosons starting

The masses of mesons and baryons, reported by the Particle Data Group (PDG),
agree with (DSI), as well as the masses of exotic narrow mesons, baryons, and
dibaryons.
  Two distributions are systematically studied: first the log of the masses
versus the log of their rank, and also the successive mass ratios. Each fitted
parameter of the second distributions, as a function of the hadronic masses,
displays the same shape for all PDG hadronic families and species. The same
parameters allow good fits for the narrow exotic mesons, baryons and dibaryons.
  When the successive mass ratios between different baryon families are
constant, this property is not observed between different meson families. Such
observation is studied within the double mass ratios eliminating the quark
masses, but the difference between baryons and mesons is not understood.
  The fractal properties and discrete scale invariance model are also used to
study nuclei yrast masses as well as excited nuclei level masses of some
nuclei. Here also the good agreement between data and fractal property, allows
to make some predictions for still unobserved nuclei masses.
  Fractal properties are also compared to several nuclei data such as :
  - atomic masses in several columns of the Mendeleev periodic table of
elements,
  - masses of series following $\beta^{+}$ or $\beta^{-}$ disintegrations,
  - one and two nucleon separation energies,
  - half-lives of some isotopes,
  - the four radioactive family periods.
  Finally, it is shown that the lepton, hadron, and boson masses can be
presented in the same frame. This is also partially true for the coupling
constants.

Differential magnification due to different magnifications of different source

model galaxies as a superposition of an axis-symmetric bulge and a face-on disk
in order to study the differential magnification effect on the composite

dispersion, star formation rate and metallicity) are modified. Depending on the
relative positions of the source and the lens, the inferred results can be
either over- or under-estimates of the true values. In general, for an extended
source at strong lensing regions with high magnifications, the inferred
physical parameters (e.g. metallicity) can be strongly biased. Therefore
detailed lens modelling is necessary to obtain the true properties of the

name of Algorithm A. In this paper, we analyze these three smoothers from an
optimization and algebraic perspective, revealing new insights on their
numerical stability properties. In doing this, we re-interpret classic
recursions as matrix decomposition methods for block tridiagonal matrices.
  First, we show that the classic RTS smoother is an implementation of the
forward block tridiagonal (FBT) algorithm (also known as Thomas algorithm) for
particular block tridiagonal systems. We study the numerical stability
properties of this scheme, connecting the condition number of the full system
to properties of the individual blocks encountered during standard recursion.
Second, we study the M smoother, and prove it is equivalent to a backward block
tridiagonal (BBT) algorithm with a stronger stability guarantee than RTS.
Third, we illustrate how the MF smoother solves a block tridiagonal system, and
prove that it has the same numerical stability properties of RTS (but not those
of M). Finally, we present a new hybrid RTS/M (FBT/BBT) smoothing scheme, which
is faster than MF, and has the same numerical stability guarantees of RTS and

the fact that a signal of interest admits a sparse representation over some
dictionary. Dictionaries are either available analytically, or can be learned
from a suitable training set. While analytic dictionaries permit to capture the
global structure of a signal and allow a fast implementation, learned
dictionaries often perform better in applications as they are more adapted to
the considered class of signals. In imagery, unfortunately, the numerical
burden for (i) learning a dictionary and for (ii) employing the dictionary for
reconstruction tasks only allows to deal with relatively small image patches
that only capture local image information. The approach presented in this paper
aims at overcoming these drawbacks by allowing a separable structure on the
dictionary throughout the learning process. On the one hand, this permits
larger patch-sizes for the learning phase, on the other hand, the dictionary is
applied efficiently in reconstruction tasks. The learning procedure is based on
optimizing over a product of spheres which updates the dictionary as a whole,
thus enforces basic dictionary properties such as mutual coherence explicitly
during the learning procedure. In the special case where no separable structure
is enforced, our method competes with state-of-the-art dictionary learning
methods like K-SVD.

the documents relevancy evolves from users feedbacks through clicks, and
provides a plug-in framework for incorporating different click models. Based on
the Multi-Armed Bandit theory, we propose a simple implementation of our
framework using a dynamic ranking rule that takes rank bias and exploration of

parameter for our model, and then analyse its performance and a number of

discovering close companions to late-type stars by removing the stellar
spectrum through a subtraction of spectra obtained at different orbital phases
and discovering the companion spectrum in the difference spectrum in which the
companion lines appear twice (positive and negative signal). The resulting
radial velocity difference of these two signals provides the true mass of the
companion, if the orbital solution for the radial velocities of the primary is
known. We select the CO line region in the K-band for our study, because it
provides a favourable star-to-companion brightness ratio for our test case
GJ1046, an M2V dwarf with a low-mass companion that most likely is a brown
dwarf. Furthermore, these lines remain largely unblended in the difference
spectrum so that the radial velocity amplitude of the companion can be measured
directly. Only if the companion rotates rapidly and has a small radial velocity
due to a high mass, does blending occur for all lines so that our approach
fails. We also consider activity of the host star, and show that the companion
difference flux can be expected to have larger amplitude than the residual
signal from the active star so that stellar activity does not inhibit the
determination of the companion mass. In addition to determining the companion
mass, we restore the single companion spectrum from the difference spectrum
using singular value decomposition.

communication is used for real-time traffic (critical data) or on-demand data
while Multi-hop communication is used for normal data delivery. One of the
prime challenges in WBASNs is sensing of the heat generated by the implanted
sensor nodes. The proposed routing algorithm is thermal-aware which senses the
link Hot-spot and routes the data away from these links. Continuous mobility of
human body causes disconnection between previous established links. So,
mobility support and energy-management is introduced to overcome the problem.
Linear Programming (LP) model for maximum information extraction and minimum
energy consumption is presented in this study. MATLAB simulations of proposed
routing algorithm are performed for lifetime and successful packet delivery in
comparison with Multi-hop communication. The results show that the proposed
routing algorithm has less energy consumption and more reliable as compared to
Multi-hop communication.

Networks (WSNs). One of the major issue of WSNs is development of energy
efficient routing protocols. Clustering is an effective way to increase energy
efficiency. Mostly, heterogenous protocols consider two or three energy level
of nodes. In reality, heterogonous WSNs contain large range of energy levels.
By analyzing communication energy consumption of the clusters and large range
of energy levels in heterogenous WSN, we propose BEENISH (Balanced Energy
Efficient Network Integrated Super Heterogenous) Protocol. It assumes WSN
containing four energy levels of nodes. Here, Cluster Heads (CHs) are elected
on the bases of residual energy level of nodes. Simulation results show that it
performs better than existing clustering protocols in heterogeneous WSNs. Our
protocol achieve longer stability, lifetime and more effective messages than
Distributed Energy Efficient Clustering (DEEC), Developed DEEC (DDEEC) and
Enhanced DEEC (EDEEC).

The elastic modulus of the suspensions decreases with the bubble volume
fraction. This decrease is all the sharper as the elastic capillary number
(defined as the ratio of the paste elastic modulus to the bubble capillary
pressure) is high, which accounts for the softening of the bubbles as compared
to the paste. By contrast, the yield stress of most studied materials is not
modified by the presence of bubbles. Their plastic behavior is governed by the
plastic capillary number, defined as the ratio of the paste yield stress to the
bubble capillary pressure. At low plastic capillary number values, bubbles
behave as nondeformable inclusions, and we predict that the suspension
dimensionless yield stress should remain close to unity. At large plastic
capillary number values, we observe bubble breakup during mixing: bubbles are
deformed by shear. Finally, at the highest bubble volume fractions, the yield
stress increases abruptly: this is interpreted as a 'foamy yield stress fluid'
regime, which takes place when the paste mesoscopic constitutive elements are
strongly confined in the films between the bubbles.

pore pressures appear in low permeability soils and rocks because the thermal

phenomenon has clearly been observed in various in-situ heating tests conducted

URL in France (TER test, Wileveau and Su; 2007 [3]) The processes of coring,
transportation, storage and specimen trimming induce some desaturation in the
sample. Due to the very low permeability (10-20 m2) of the COx claystone, a
long period of time is necessary to properly resaturate the sample, a mandatory
condition to satisfactorily investigate thermal pressurisation. Particular
emphasis was hence put on the previous saturation procedure that was carried
out under in-situ effective stress condition. Thermal pressurization has been
investigated by performing undrained heating tests while measuring pore
pressures changes in a specially adapted thermal isotropic compression cell.
Special care was devoted to calibration procedures to account for the effects
of the system on the pore pressure measurements. The thermal pressurization
coefficient measured appeared to change with temperature, mainly because of the
changes with temperature of both the water thermal expansion coefficient of
water and the drained compression coefficient of the claystone.

and the performance evaluation of multi-source multi-relay network-coded
cooperative diversity protocols. These protocols are useful to counteract the
spectral inefficiency of repetition-based cooperation. We provide a general
analytical framework for analysis and design of wireless networks using the
Demodulate-and-Forward (DemF) protocol with binary Network Coding (NC) at the
relays and Cooperative Maximal Ratio Combining (C-MRC) at the destination. Our
system model encompasses an arbitrary number of relays which offer two
cooperation levels: i) full-cooperative relays, which postpone the transmission
of their own data frames to help the transmission of the sources via DemF
relaying and binary NC; and ii) partial-cooperative relays, which exploit NC to
transmit their own data frames along with the packets received from the
sources. The relays can apply NC on different subsets of sources, which is
shown to provide the sources with unequal diversity orders. Guidelines to
choose the packets to be combined, i.e., the network code, to achieve the
desired diversity order are given. Our study shows that partial-cooperative
relays provide no contribution to the diversity order of the sources.
Theoretical findings and design guidelines are validated through extensive
Monte Carlo simulations.

LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 distinguish this rich system from conventional
two-dimensional electron gases at compound semiconductor interfaces. The origin
of this 2-DEL, however, is highly debated with focus on the role of defects in
the SrTiO3 while the LaAlO3 has been assumed perfect. Our experiments and first
principles calculations show that the cation stoichiometry of the nominal
LaAlO3 layer is key to 2-DEL formation: only Al-rich LaAlO3 results in a 2-DEL.
While extrinsic defects including oxygen deficiency are known to render
LaAlO3/SrTiO3 samples conducting, our results show that in the absence of such
extrinsic defects, an interface 2-DEL can form. Its origin is consistent with
an intrinsic electronic reconstruction occurring to counteract a polarization
catastrophe. This work provides a roadmap for identifying other interfaces
where emergent behaviors await discovery.

network analysis, because they ignore an essential part of the available
information: the network structure. Therefore, they can lead to incorrect
interpretations. In this article, we review these measures, and illustrate this
limitation. We propose a modification to solve this problem, and apply it to
the three most widespread measures: purity, Rand index and normalized mutual
information (NMI). We then perform an experimental evaluation on artificially
generated networks with realistic community structure. We assess the relevance
of the modified measures by comparison with their traditional counterparts, and
also relatively to the topological properties of the community structures. On
these data, the modified NMI turns out to provide the most relevant results.

spooky action at a distance in nature, however, the validity of quantum

notion of nonlocality is physically improper, the basic principle of locality
in nature is well respected by quantum mechanics, namely, the uncertainty
principle. We show that the quantum bound on the Clauser, Horne, Shimony, and
Holt (CHSH) inequality can be recovered from the uncertainty relation in a
multipartite setting. We further argue that the super-quantum correlation
demonstrated by the nonlocal box is not physically comparable with the quantum
one. The origin of the quantum structure of nature still remains to be
explained, some post-quantum theory which is more complete in some sense than
quantum mechanics is possible and might not necessarily be a hidden variable

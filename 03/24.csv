lowers the disk instability limit, explaining this disagreement. The orbital

that the donor star is a low-entropy C/O white dwarf, consistent with optical

variations are common (and well-documented) among persistent UCXBs, which

the luminosity function of known UCXBs in the Milky Way, which extends to lower

gravity models can be expressed in terms of a scalar degree of freedom by
redefinition of models variable. The conformal transformation of the action
from Jordan frame to Einstein frame makes the scalar degree of freedom more
explicit and can be studied conveniently. We have investigated the features of
the scalar degree of freedoms and the consequent cosmological implications of
the power-law ($\xi R^n$) and the Starobinsky (disappearing cosmological
constant) $f(R)$ gravity models numerically in the Einstein frame. Both the
models show interesting behaviour of their scalar degree of freedom and could
produce the accelerated expansion of the Universe in the Einstein frame with
the negative equation of state of the scalar field. However the scalar field
potential for the power-law model is the well behaved function of the field,
whereas the potential becomes flat for higher value of field in the case of the
Starobinsky model. Moreover, the equation of state of the scalar field for the
power-law model is always negative and less than -1/3, which corresponds to the
behaviour of the dark energy that produces the accelerated expansion of the
Universe. This is not always the case for the Starobinsky model. At late times
Starobinsky model behaves as cosmological constant $\Lambda$ as behaves by
power-law model for the values of $n\rightarrow 2$ at all times.

They have a number of interesting
properties and play a role in (Lagrange) interpolation problems, partial
fraction expansions, and finding solutions to linear ordinary differential
equations, to mention just a few applications. Usually, one takes these
matrices square, $q\times q$ say, in which case the $i$-th column is given by
$u(z_i)$, where we write $u(z)=(1,z,...,z^{q-1})^\top$. If all the $z_i$
($i=1,...,q$) are different, the Vandermonde matrix is non-singular, otherwise
not. The latter case obviously takes place when all $z_i$ are the same, $z$
say, in which case one could speak of a confluent Vandermonde matrix.
Non-singularity is obtained if one considers the matrix $V(z)$ whose $i$-th
column ($i=1,...,q$) is given by the $(i-1)$-th derivative $u^{(i-1)}(z)^\top$.
  We will consider generalizations of the confluent Vandermonde matrix $V(z)$
by considering matrices obtained by using as building blocks the matrices
$M(z)=u(z)w(z)$, with $u(z)$ as above and $w(z)=(1,z,...,z^{r-1})$, together
with its derivatives $M^{(k)}(z)$. Specifically, we will look at matrices whose
$ij$-th block is given by $M^{(i+j)}(z)$, where the indices $i,j$ by convention
have initial value zero. These in general non-square matrices exhibit a
block-Hankel structure. We will answer a number of elementary questions for
this matrix. What is the rank? What is the null-space? Can the latter be
parametrized in a simple way? Does it depend on $z$? What are left or right
inverses? It turns out that answers can be obtained by factorizing the matrix
into a product of other matrix polynomials having a simple structure. The
answers depend on the size of the matrix $M(z)$ and the number of derivatives
$M^{(k)}(z)$ that is involved. The results are obtained by mostly elementary
methods, no specific knowledge of the theory of matrix polynomials is needed.

tan(\beta) and the ""non-holomorphic"" Yukawa couplings \epsilon^f_ij
(f=u,d,\ell). In our analysis we constrain the elements \epsilon^f_ij in
various ways: In a first step we give order of magnitude constraints on
\epsilon^f_ij from 't Hooft's naturalness criterion. Then we constrain the
Yukawa structure of the type-III 2HDM from tree-level FCNC processes
(B_s,d->\mu^+\mu^-, \tau^-->\mu^-\mu^+\mu^-, etc.) and observe that all flavor
off-diagonal elements except \epsilon^u_32,31 and \epsilon^u_23,13 must be very
small in order to satisfy the experimental bounds. In a third step, we consider
Higgs mediated loop contributions to FCNC processes (b->s,d\gamma,
\mu->e\gamma, etc.) finding that also \epsilon^u_13 and \epsilon^u_23 must be
very small, while the bounds on \epsilon^u_31 and \epsilon^u_32 are especially
weak. Taking into account the constraints from FCNC processes we study the
possible size of contributions from tree-level charged Higgs exchange.
Interestingly, the unconstrained elements \epsilon^u_{32,31} enter directly the
branching ratios for B->\tau\nu, B->D\tau\nu and B->D*\tau\nu and we show that
the deviations from the SM predictions in these processes can be explained
simultaneously. We give upper limits on the branching ratios of the lepton

complexes over an exact category E satisfying certain finiteness conditions, we
construct an associative unital ""semi-derived Hall algebra"" SDH(E). This
algebra is an object sitting, in some sense, between the usual Hall algebra
H(C^b(E)) and the Hall algebra of the bounded derived category D^b(E),
introduced by Toen and further generalized by Xiao and Xu. It has the structure
of a free module over a suitably defined quantum torus of acyclic complexes,
with a basis given by the isomorphism classes of objects in the bounded derived
category D^b(E). We prove the invariance of SDH(E) under derived equivalences
induced by exact functors between exact categories.
  For E having enough projectives and such that each object has a finite
projective resolution, we describe a similar construction for the category of
Z/2-graded complexes, with similar properties of associativity, freeness over
the quantum torus and derived invariance. In particular, we obtain that this
Z/2-graded semi-derived Hall algebra is isomorphic to the two-periodic Hall
algebra recently introduced by Bridgeland. We deduce that Bridgeland's Hall
algebra is preserved under tilting.
  When E is hereditary and has enough projectives, we show that the
multiplication in SDH(E) is given by the same formula as the Ringel-Hall
multiplication, and SDH(E) is isomorphic to a certain quotient of the classical
Hall algebra H(C^b(E)) localized at the classes of acyclic complexes. We also
prove the same result in the Z/2-graded case.

accumulation of somatic mutations within the genome. For oncogenes
specifically, current research suggests that there is a small set of ""driver""
mutations that are primarily responsible for tumorigenesis. Further, due to
some recent pharmacological successes in treating these driver mutations and
their resulting tumors, a variety of methods have been developed to identify
potential driver mutations using methods such as machine learning and
mutational clustering. We propose a novel methodology that increases our power
to identify mutational clusters by taking into account protein tertiary
structure via a graph theoretical approach.
  Results: We have designed and implemented GraphPAC (Graph Protein Amino Acid
Clustering) to identify mutational clustering while considering protein spatial
structure. Using GraphPAC, we are able to detect novel clusters in proteins
that are known to exhibit mutation clustering as well as identify clusters in
proteins without evidence of prior clustering based on current methods.
Specifically, by utilizing the spatial information available in the Protein
Data Bank (PDB) along with the mutational data in the Catalogue of Somatic
Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC), GraphPAC identifies new mutational clusters in
well known oncogenes such as EGFR and KRAS. Further, by utilizing graph theory
to account for the tertiary structure, GraphPAC identifies clusters in DPP4,
NRP1 and other proteins not identified by existing methods. The R package is
available at: http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GraphPAC.html
  Conclusion: GraphPAC provides an alternative to iPAC and an extension to
current methodology when identifying potential activating driver mutations by
utilizing a graph theoretic approach when considering protein tertiary
structure.

correct f crash or f/2 Byzantine faults among n different machines, replication

that requires just f additional backup machines. First, we build a framework
for fault tolerance in DFSMs based on the notion of Hamming distances. We
introduce the concept of an (f,m)-fusion, which is a set of m backup machines

fusion (over replication) is 38% (range 0-99%). To demonstrate the practical
use of fusion, we describe its potential application to the MapReduce

applied to this framework. While a pure replication-based solution requires 1.8

The 30 THz emission exhibited remarkable time coincidence with peaks observed
at microwave, mm/submm, visible, EUV and hard X-ray wavelengths. The emission
location coincides with a very weak white-light feature, and is consistent with
heating below the temperature minimum in the atmosphere. However, there are
problems in attributing the heating to accelerated electrons. The peak 30 THz

attributed to non-thermal electrons in the corona. The 30 THz emission could be
consistent with an optically thick spectrum increasing from low to high

region of the leading hemisphere at an abundance of 0.13+/-0.07% by number
abundance relative to water. We find comparable results for the two nights over

be now thought of as a two dimensional network of corner sharing triangles.
Next each triangle is made into a tetrahedron, by raising the silicon atom

degrees of freedom to easily form a network of identical corner sharing
tetrahedra if there is a symmetry plane through the center of the bilayer going
through the layer of oxygen ions that join the upper and lower layers. This has
the consequence that the upper rings lie exactly above the lower rings, which
are tilted in general. The assumption of a network of perfect corner sharing
tetrahedra leads to a range of possible densities that we have previously
characterized in three dimensional zeolites as a flexibility window. Finally,
using a realistic potential, we have relaxed the bilayer to determine the
density, and other structural characteristics such as the Si-Si pair
distribution functions and the Si-O-Si bond angle distribution, which are
compared to the experimental results obtained by direct imaging.

a novel state of electronic matter called the Quantum Spin Hall (QSH) state [4,

unique number of participants, total number of active behaviors and network
resource utilization. We also propose heuristics to distribute the behaviors

We test our approach on synthetic and real-world topologies with excellent

conditions dust settling can be constrained by high angular resolution
observations at mm wavelengths, and which observational strategies are suited
for such studies. Exploring a large range of models, we generate synthetic
images of disks with different degrees of dust settling, and simulate high
angular resolution (~ 0.05-0.3"") ALMA observations of these synthetic disks.
The resulting data sets are then analyzed blindly with homogeneous disk models
(where dust and gas are totally mixed) and the derived disk parameters are used
as tracers of the settling factor. Our dust disks are partially resolved by
ALMA and present some specific behaviors on radial and mainly vertical
directions, which can be used to quantify the level of settling. We find out
that an angular resolution better than or equal to ~ 0.1"" (using 2.3 km
baselines at 0.8mm) allows us to constrain the dust scale height and flaring
index with sufficient precision to unambiguously distinguish between settled
and non-settled disks, provided the inclination is close enough to edge-on (i
>= 75{\deg}). Ignoring dust settling and assuming hydrostatic equilibrium when
analyzing such disks affects the derived dust temperature and the radial
dependency of the dust emissivity index. The surface density distribution can
also be severely biased at the highest inclinations. However, the derived dust
properties remain largely unaffected if the disk scale height is fitted
separately. ALMA has the potential to test some of the dust settling
mechanisms, but for real disks, deviations from ideal geometry (warps, spiral
waves) may provide an ultimate limit on the dust settling detection.

target using a covariance descriptor, as this descriptor is robust to problems
such as pixel-pixel misalignment, pose and illumination changes, that commonly
occur in visual tracking. We model the changes in the template using a
generative process. We introduce a new dynamical model for the template update
using a random walk on the Riemannian manifold where the covariance descriptors
lie in. This is done using log-transformed space of the manifold to free the
constraints imposed inherently by positive semidefinite matrices. Modeling
template variations and poses kinetics together in the state space enables us
to jointly quantify the uncertainties relating to the kinematic states and the

posterior distribution of the kinematic states and the template is done using a
particle filter. Our results shows that this principled approach can be robust

emissions in many solar flares are consistent with double power laws with a

least in electron-dominated events the hardening in photon spectrum reflects an
intrinsic hardening in the source electron spectrum. In this paper, we point
out that a power law spectrum of electron with a hardening at high energies can
be explained by diffusive shock acceleration of electrons at a termination
shock with a finite width. Our suggestion is based on an early analytical work
by Drury et al., where the steady state transport equation at a shock with a
tanh profile was solved for a $p$-independent diffusion coefficient. Numerical
simulations with a $p$-dependent diffusion coefficient show hardenings in the
accelerated electron spectrum which are comparable with observations. One
necessary condition for our proposed scenario to work is that high energy
electrons resonate with the inertial range of the MHD turbulence and low energy
electrons resonate with the dissipation range of the MHD turbulence at the
acceleration site, and the spectrum of the dissipation range $\sim k^{-2.7}$. A
$\sim k^{-2.7}$ dissipation range spectrum is consistent with recent solar wind
observations.

investigate effects of the density-dependent axial and weak-vector form factors
on the electro-neutrino ($\nu_e$) and anti-electro-neutrino $({\bar \nu_e})$
reactions via neutral current (NC) for a nucleon in nuclear medium or $^{12}$C.
For the density-dependent form factors, we exploit the quark-meson-coupling
(QMC) model, and apply them to the $\nu_e$ and ${\bar \nu_e}$ induced reactions
by NC. About 12% decrease of the total cross section by $\nu_e$ reaction on the
nucleon is obtained at normal density, $\rho = \rho_0 \sim 0.15 {fm}^{-3} $, as
well as about 18% reduction of total ${\nu}_e$ cross section on $^{12}$C, by
the modification of the weak form factors of the bound nucleon.
  However, similarly to the charged current reaction, effects of the nucleon
property change in the ${\bar \nu}_e$ reaction reduce significantly the cross
sections about 30% for the nucleon in matter and $^{12}$C cases. Such a large
asymmetry in the ${\bar \nu}_e$ cross sections is addressed to originate from
the different helicities of ${\bar \nu}_e$ and ${\nu}_e$.

internal spin (or other relevant field) components are inherently spatially
(typically, direction) dependent. Compass-type interactions appear in diverse
physical systems including Mott insulators with orbital degrees of freedom
(where interactions sensitively depend on the spatial orientation of the
orbitals involved), the low energy effective theories of frustrated quantum
magnets, systems with strong spin-orbit couplings (such as the iridates),
vacancy centers, and cold atomic gases. Kitaev's models, in particular the
compass variant on the honeycomb lattice, realize basic notions of topological
quantum computing. The fundamental inter-dependence between internal (spin,
orbital, or other) and external (i.e., spatial) degrees of freedom which
underlies compass models generally leads to very rich behaviors including the
frustration of (semi-)classical ordered states on non-frustrated lattices and
to enhanced quantum effects prompting, in certain cases, the appearance of zero
temperature quantum spin liquids. As a consequence of these frustrations, new
types of symmetries and their associated degeneracies may appear. These
intermediate symmetries lie midway between the extremes of global symmetries
and local gauge symmetries and lead to effective dimensional reductions. We
review compass models in a unified manner, paying close attention to exact
consequences of these symmetries, and to thermal and quantum fluctuations that
stabilize orders via order out of disorder effects. We review non-trivial
statistics and the appearance of topological quantum orders in compass systems
in which, by virtue of their intermediate symmetry standard orders do not
arise. This is complemented by a survey of numerical results. Where appropriate
theoretical and experimental results are compared.

thermodynamical properties of the climate system and explore, using a a
flexible climate model, how such properties depend on the energy input of the
parent star, on the infrared atmospheric opacity, and on the rotation rate. It
is possible to reproduce the multi-stability properties reminiscent of the
paleoclimatologically relevant snowball (SB) - warm (W) conditions. We then
study the thermodynamics of the W and SB states, clarifying the role of the
hydrological cycle in shaping the irreversibility and the efficiency of the W
states, and emphasizing the extreme diversity of the SB states, where dry
conditions are realized. Thermodynamics provides the clue for studying the
tipping points of the system and leads us to constructing parametrizations
where the main thermodynamic properties are expressed as functions of the
emission temperature of the planet only. Such functions are rather robust with
respect to changing the rotation rate of the planet from the current
terrestrial one to half of it. We then explore the dynamical range of slowy
rotating and phase locked planets. There is a critical rotation rate below
which the multi-stability properties are lost. Such critical rotation rate
corresponds roughly to the phase lock 2:1 condition. Therefore, if an
Earth-like planet is 1:1 phase locked with respect to the parent star, only one
climatic state would be compatible with a given set of astronomical and
astrophysical parameters. These results have relevance for the general theory
of planetary circulation and for the definition of necessary and sufficient

the tripartite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state. We give an exact
simulation of arbitrary independent von Neumann measurements on general
n-partite GHZ states. Our protocol requires O(n^2) bits of expected
communication between the parties, and O(n log n) expected time is sufficient
to carry it out in parallel. Furthermore, we need only an expectation of O(n)
independent unbiased random bits, with no need for the generation of continuous
real random variables nor prior shared random variables. In the case of
equatorial measurements, we improve on the prior art with a protocol that needs
only O(n log n) bits of communication and O(log^2 n) parallel time. At the cost

opposed to an accurate determination of the precise location. Geo-fencing
approach is based on the observation that users move from one place to another
and then stay at that place for a while. These places can be, for example,
commercial properties, homes, office centers and so on. As per geo-fencing
approach they could be described (defined) as some geographic areas bounded by
polygons. It assumes users simply move from fence to fence and stay inside
fences for a while. In this article we replace geo-based boundaries with
network proximity rules. This new approach let us effectively deploy location
based services indoor and provide a significant energy saving for mobile
devices comparing with the traditional methods.

downlink transmissions with only partial channel state information (CSI)
available at the transmitter. However, the impact of receive spatial diversity

multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast system with RBF applied at each base station

antenna selection (AS) based spatial receiver employed at each mobile terminal.
We investigate the effect of different spatial diversity receivers on the
achievable sum-rate of multi-cell RBF systems subject to both the intra- and
inter-cell interferences. We first derive closed-form expressions for the
distributions of the receiver signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)
with different spatial diversity techniques, based on which we compare their
rate performances at finite signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). We then investigate
the asymptotically high-SNR regime and for a tractable analysis assume that the
number of users in each cell scales in a certain order with the per-cell SNR as
SNR goes to infinity. Under this setup, we characterize the degrees of freedom
(DoF) region for multi-cell RBF systems with different types of spatial
receivers, which consists of all the achievable DoF tuples for the individual
sum-rate of all the cells. The DoF region analysis provides a succinct
characterization of the interplays among the receive spatial diversity,
multiuser diversity, spatial multiplexing gain, inter-/intra-cell

molybdate using Monte-Carlo refractive index matching technique (MCRIM). The
MCRIM technique is a combination of experiment and simulations that allows the
absolute light yield of scintillators to be determined by taking into account
effects of refraction, scattering and absorption in the material. The light
collection efficiency of the scintillator-detector assembly was simulated using
the ZEMAX ray-tracing software. By tuning the optical parameters of the
scintillation crystal, a model was derived that gives good agreement with the
experimental results. It is shown that the light collection efficiency of
scintillators increases with transmittance and scattering due to an enhanced
probability for photons to escape the crystal volume. Using MCRIM, the absolute
light yield for the 40Ca100MoO4 scintillator was found to be 7.5+-1.2 ph/keV at
room temperature. Comparative measurements using a CaWO4 scintillator as a
reference show good agreement with this result. In that way, the study

pressure shift, owing to the high pressure buffer gas of the hollow-cathode

  of the Symposium on Computational Geometry (SoCG 2013)",,,,"cs.CG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a new algorithm for computing motorcycle graphs that runs in
O(n^(4/3+e)) time for any e>0, improving on all previously known algorithms.
The main application of this result is to computing the straight skeleton of a
polygon. It allows us to compute the straight skeleton of a non-degenerate
polygon with h holes in O(n.sqrt(h+1)log^2(n)+n^(4/3+e)) expected time. If all
input coordinates are O(log n)-bit rational numbers, we can compute the
straight skeleton of a (possibly degenerate) polygon with h holes in
O(n.sqrt(h+1)log^3(n)) expected time.
  In particular, it means that we can compute the straight skeleton of a simple
polygon in O(n.log^3(n)) expected time if all input coordinates are O(\log
n)-bit rationals, while all previously known algorithms have worst-case running
time larger than n^(3/2).

parsing engine and a language specific grammar. The parsing engine is a
language independent program, while grammar and language specific rules and
resources are given as text files, consisting in a list of constituent
structuresand a lexical database with word sense related features and
constraints. Since its theoretical background is principally Tesniere's
Elements de syntaxe, SYNTAGMA's grammar emphasizes the role of argument
structure (valency) in constraint satisfaction, and allows also horizontal
bounds, for instance treating coordination. Notions such as Pro, traces, empty
categories are derived from Generative Grammar and some solutions are close to
Government&Binding Theory, although they are the result of an autonomous
research. These properties allow SYNTAGMA to manage complex syntactic
configurations and well known weak points in parsing engineering. An important
resource is the semantic network, which is used in disambiguation tasks.
Parsing process follows a bottom-up, rule driven strategy. Its behavior can be
controlled and fine-tuned.

of these previously constructed representations is that they all respect the

representations of the Galilean line group that violate the equivalence

quantum mechanics in non-inertial reference frames. This formulation is
grounded in a class of unitary cocycle representations of what we have called
the Galilean line group, the generalization of the Galilei group to include
transformations amongst non-inertial reference frames. These representations
show that in quantum mechanics, just as the case in classical mechanics, the
transformations to accelerating reference frames give rise to fictitious

Galilean line group that uphold the non-relativistic equivalence principle as
well as representations that violate the equivalence principle. In these
previous studies, the focus was on linear accelerations. In this paper, we
undertake an extension of the formulation to include rotational accelarations.
We show that the incorporation of rotational accelerations requires a class of
\emph{loop prolongations} of the Galilean line group and their unitary cocycle
representations. We recover the centrifugal and Coriolis force effects from
these loop representations. Loops are more general than groups in that their
multiplication law need not be associative. Hence, our broad theoretical claim
is that a Galilean quantum theory that holds in arbitrary non-inertial
reference frames requires going beyond groups and group representations, the
well-stablished framework for implementing symmetry transformations in quantum
mechanics.

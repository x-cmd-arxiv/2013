Orion Nebula. This survey includes the Lynds 1641 (L1641) dark cloud, a region
of the Orion A cloud with very few massive stars and hence a relatively low
ambient UV flux, and the region around the O9 III star Iota Orionis. In
addition to proprietary data, we used archival XMM data of the Orion Nebula
Cluster (ONC) to extend our analysis to a major fraction of the Orion A cloud.
We have detected 1060 X-ray sources in L1641 and Iota Ori region. About 94% of
the sources have 2MASS & Spitzer counterparts, 204 and 23 being Class II and
Class I or protostars objects, respectively. In addition, we have identified
489 X-ray sources as counterparts to Class III candidates, given they are
bright in X-rays and appear as normal photospheres at mid-IR wavelengths. The
remaining 205 X-ray sources are likely distant AGNs or other galactic sources
not related to Orion A. We find that Class III candidates appear more
concentrated in two main clusters in L1641. The first cluster of Class III
stars is found toward the northern part of L1641, concentrated around Iota Ori.
The stars in this cluster are more evolved than those in the Orion Nebula. We
estimate a distance of 300-320 pc for this cluster and thus it is closer than
the Orion A cloud. Another cluster rich in Class III stars is located in L1641
South and appears to be a slightly older cluster embedded in the Orion A cloud.
Furthermore, other evolved Class III stars are found north of the ONC toward
NGC 1977.

is proposed here that MSL1 can usefully be further split into two aspects, one
(MLS1E) representing selection of particles based in their individual
interaction with environmental properties, and one (MLS1G) representing Multi
Level Selection of particles based in their relation to group properties.
Similarly MSL2 can be split into two parts based in this distinction. This
splitting enables a characterisation of how emergent group properties can
affect particle selection, and thus affect group traits that are important for
survival. This proposal is illustrated by considering a key aspect of animal
and human life, namely the formation of social groups, which greatly enhances
survival prospects. The biological mechanism that underlies such group
formation is the existence of innate primary emotional systems studied by
Panksepp (1998), effective through the ascending systems in the brain that
diffuse neurotransmitters such as dopamine and norepinephrine through the
cortex. Evolutionary emergence of such brain mechanisms, and hence the
emergence of social groups, can only result from multi-level selection
characterised by the combination of MSL2 and MLS1G. The distinctions proposed
here should be useful in other contexts.

A search for pairs of matched back-to-back circles in the higher resolution

results rule out universes with topologies that predict pairs of such circles
with radii larger than approximately 10 degrees. This places a lower bound on
the size of the fundamental domain for a flat universe of about 27.9 Gpc. We
study also the possibility for constraining the topology of the Universe by
means of the matched circles statistic applied to polarised CMB anisotropy
maps. The advantages of using the CMB polarisation maps in studies of the
topology over simply analysing the temperature data as has been done to-date
are clearly demonstrated. It is found that the noise levels of both Planck and
next generation CMB experiments data are no longer prohibitive and should be
low enough to enable the use of the polarisation maps for such studies.

splitting hybrid receivers which are able to split the received signals into
two power streams for concurrent information decoding and energy harvesting.
Two scenarios are investigated considering different power splitting abilities
of the receivers. In the first scenario, we assume receivers which can split
the received power into a continuous set of power streams with arbitrary power
splitting ratios. In the second scenario, we examine receivers which can split
the received power only into a discrete set of power streams with fixed power
splitting ratios. In both scenarios, we formulate the corresponding algorithm
design as a non-convex optimization problem which takes into account the
circuit power consumption, the minimum data rate requirements of delay
constrained services, the minimum required system data rate, and the minimum
amount of power that has to be delivered to the receivers. Subsequently, by
exploiting fractional programming and dual decomposition, suboptimal iterative
resource allocation algorithms are proposed to solve the non-convex problems.
Simulation results illustrate that the proposed iterative resource allocation
algorithms approach the optimal solution within a small number of iterations
and unveil the trade-off between energy efficiency, system capacity, and
wireless power transfer.

power-law form of the primordial spectrum of curvature perturbations. In this
paper we show that in the presence of a tensor component, a turn-over in the
initial spectrum is preferred by current observations, and hence non-power-law
models ought to be considered. For instance, for a power-law parameterisation
with both a tensor component and running parameter, current data show a
preference for a negative running at more than $2.5\sigma$ C.L. As a
consequence of this deviation from a power-law, constraints on the
tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ are slightly broader. We also present constraints on
the inflationary parameters for a model-independent reconstruction and the
Lasenby & Doran (LD) model. In particular, the constraints on the
tensor-to-scalar ratio from the LD model are: $r_{\rm LD}=0.11\pm{0.024}$. In
addition to current data, we show expected constraints from Planck-like and

as an error measure may not be a relevant choice. Several methods have been
developed where the performance measure retained richer information than the
mere misclassification rate: misclassification costs, ROC-based information,
etc. Following this idea of dealing with alternate measures of performance, we
propose to address imbalanced classification problems by using a new measure to
be optimized: the norm of the confusion matrix. Indeed, recent results show
that using the norm of the confusion matrix as an error measure can be quite
interesting due to the fine-grain informations contained in the matrix,
especially in the case of imbalanced classes. Our first contribution then
consists in showing that optimizing criterion based on the confusion matrix
gives rise to a common background for cost-sensitive methods aimed at dealing
with imbalanced classes learning problems. As our second contribution, we
propose an extension of a recent multi-class boosting method --- namely
AdaBoost.MM --- to the imbalanced class problem, by greedily minimizing the
empirical norm of the confusion matrix. A theoretical analysis of the
properties of the proposed method is presented, while experimental results
illustrate the behavior of the algorithm and show the relevancy of the approach

quasicategories. These theorems, inspired by Waldhausen's 1985 Approximation
Theorem, give sufficient conditions for an exact functor of Waldhausen
quasicategories to induce a level-wise weak homotopy equivalence of K-theory
spectra.
  The Pre-Approximation Theorem, which holds in the general setting of
quasicategories without Waldhausen structures, provides sufficient conditions
for a functor F:A->B to restrict to an equivalence of the maximal
infinity-groupoids in A and B.
  Our Approximation Theorems follow from the Pre-Approximation Theorem. The
Approximation Theorem in the quasicategorical setting most analogous to
Waldhausen's is: if an exact functor F:A -> B satisfies Waldhausen's App 1 and
App 2, and the domain A admits colimits of the aforementioned type and F
preserves them, then K(F) is a level-wise equivalence. As a corollary, if F is
an exact functor with ho(F) an equivalence of ordinary categories, and every
morphism in the domain A is a cofibration, then K(F) is a level-wise
equivalence.
  We then introduce a version of App 2 called Cofibration App 2 that only
requires factorization of cofibrations Fa >-> b as (equiv) o F(cofibration) and
prove an analogous Cofibration Approximation Theorem, and a corollary for
certain functors that induce an equivalence of cofibration homotopy categories.
  We also prove that S_n^infinity is Waldhausen equivalent to
\overline{\mathcal{F}_{n-1}^infinity} using the mid anodyne maps known as spine
inclusions, and clarify how hypotheses and notions in Waldhausen structures are
related in new ways in the context of quasicategories.

the large Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of the transmit signal which
renders a straightforward implementation costly and inefficient. In this paper,
a new PAPR reduction scheme is introduced where a number of sequences from the

the sequence with lowest PAPR is selected for transmission. A comparison of

Caenorhabditis elegans is not necessarily archetypical for nematodes. The
phylum Nematoda is divided into the Chromadorea (indcludes C. elegans) and the
Enoplea. Compared to C. elegans, enoplean nematodes have very different
patterns of cell division and determination. Embryogenesis of the enoplean
Romanomermis culicivorax has been studied in great detail, but the genetic
circuitry underpinning development in this species is unknown. Results We
created a draft genome of R. culicivorax and compared its developmental gene
content with that of two nematodes, C. elegans and Trichinella spiralis
(another enoplean), and a representative arthropod Tribolium castaneum. This
genome evidence shows that R. culicivorax retains components of the conserved
metazoan developmental toolkit lost in C. elegans. T. spiralis has
independently lost even more of the toolkit than has C. elegans. However, the
C. elegans toolkit is not simply depauperate, as many genes essential for
embryogenesis in C. elegans are unique to this lineage, or have only extremely
divergent homologues in R. culicivorax and T. spiralis. These data imply
fundamental differences in the genetic programmes for early cell specification,
inductive interactions, vulva formation and sex determination. Conclusions Thus
nematodes, despite their apparent phylum-wide morphological conservatism, have
evolved major differences in the molecular logic of their development. R.
culicivorax serves as a tractable, contrasting model to C. elegans for
understanding how divergent genomic and thus regulatory backgrounds can
generate a conserved phenotype. The availability of the draft genome will
promote use of R. culicivorax as a research model.

listed in the CDAW CME catalog from 2007 March 1 to 2012 May 31 are

obtain the de-projected values of the propagation velocity, direction and

angle of SOHO, it is found that their propagation directions and angular widths
could vary in a large range, implying projection effect is a major reason
causing a CME being halo, but not the only one. Furthermore, the comparison of
the de-projected and projected velocities reveals that most FHCMEs originating

far from the vicinity of solar disk center or moving faster than 900 km

magnetostrictive effects into the simulations. Existence of weak solutions has
recently been shown in [Carbout et al. 2011]. In our contribution, we give an
alternate proof which additionally provides an effective numerical integrator.
The latter is based on lowest-order finite elements in space and a
linear-implicit Euler time-stepping. Despite the nonlinearity, only two linear
systems have to be solved per timestep, and the integrator fully decouples both
equations. Finally, we prove unconditional convergence---at least of a
subsequence---towards, and hence existence of, a weak solution of the coupled
system, as timestep size and spatial mesh-size tend to zero. Numerical

DFT+U and hybrid functionals, are applied to study magnetostructural
correlations in spin-1/2 frustrated chain compounds CuX2: CuCl2, CuBr2, and a
fictitious chain structure of CuF2. The nearest-neighbor and second-neighbor
exchange integrals, J1 and J2, are evaluated as a function of the Cu-X-Cu
bridging angle, theta, in the physically relevant range 80-110deg. In the ionic
CuF2, J1 is ferromagnetic for theta smaller 100deg. For larger angles, the
antiferromagnetic superexchange contribution becomes dominant, in accord with
the Goodenough-Kanamori-Anderson rules. However, both CuCl2 and CuBr2 feature
ferromagnetic J1 in the whole angular range studied. This surprising behavior
is ascribed to the increased covalency in the Cl and Br compounds, which
amplifies the contribution from Hund's exchange on the ligand atoms and renders
J1 ferromagnetic. At the same time, the larger spatial extent of X orbitals
enhances the antiferromagnetic J2, which is realized via the long-range
Cu-X-X-Cu paths. Both, periodic and cluster approaches supply a consistent
description of the magnetic behavior which is in good agreement with the
experimental data for CuCl2 and CuBr2. Thus, owing to their simplicity, cluster
calculations have excellent potential to study magnetic correlations in more
involved spin lattices and facilitate application of quantum-chemical methods.

particles in Schwarzschild spacetime. This potential reproduces several
relativistic features with higher accuracy than commonly used pseudo-Newtonian
approaches. The new potential reproduces the exact location of the marginally
stable, marginally bound, and photon circular orbits, as well as the exact
radial dependence of the binding energy and the angular momentum of these
orbits. Moreover, it reproduces the orbital and epicyclic angular frequencies
to better than 6%. In addition, the spatial projections of general trajectories
coincide with their relativistic counterparts, while the time evolution of
parabolic-like trajectories and the pericentre advance of elliptical-like
trajectories are both reproduced exactly. We apply this approach to a standard
thin accretion disc and find that the efficiency of energy extraction agrees to
within 3% with the exact relativistic value, while the energy flux per unit
area as a function of radius is reproduced everywhere to better than 7%. As a
further astrophysical application we implement the new approach within a
smoothed particle hydrodynamics code and study the tidal disruption of a
main-sequence star by a supermassive black hole. The results obtained are in
very good agreement with previous relativistic simulations of tidal disruptions
in Schwarzschild spacetime. The equations of motion derived from this potential

exhibited opposing migration and vaccination pressures, the dominant N2 trend
is due to vaccination, with only secondary migration interactions. Separation
and evaluation of these effects is made possible by the use of two distinct
hydropathic scales representing first-order and second-order thermodynamic
interactions. The evolutions of H1 and H3 are more complex, with larger
competing migration and vaccination effects. The linkages of H3 and N2

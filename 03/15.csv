parameterize the dose contribution to each voxel in the volume of interest from
each beamlet of unit intensity. However, due to the limitation of computer
memory and the requirement on computational efficiency, in practice matrix
elements of small values are usually truncated, which inevitably compromises
the quality of the resulting plan. A fixed-point iteration scheme has been
applied in IMRT optimization to solve this problem, which has been reported to
be effective and efficient based on the observations of the numerical
experiments. In this paper, we aim to point out the mathematics behind this
scheme and to answer the following three questions: 1) whether the fixed-point
iteration algorithm converges or not? 2) when it converges, whether the fixed
point solution is same as the original solution obtained with the complete DDC
matrix? 3) if not the same, whether the fixed point solution is more accurate
than the naive solution of the truncated problem obtained without the
fixed-point iteration? To answer these questions, we first performed
mathematical analysis and deductions using a simplified fluence map
optimization (FMO) model. Then we conducted numerical experiments on a
head-and-neck patient case using both the simplified and the original FMO
model. Both our mathematical analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate
that with proper DDC matrix truncation, the fixed-point iteration can converge.
Even though the converged solution is not the one that we obtain with the
complete DDC matrix, the fixed-point iteration scheme could significantly
improve the plan accuracy compared with the solution to the truncated problem
obtained without the fixed-point iteration.

whether particle production may have significant effects during inflation. Warm
inflation provides a natural arena to address this issue, with interactions
between the scalar inflaton and other degrees of freedom leading to dissipative
entropy production and associated thermal fluctuations. In this context, we
present relations between CMB observables that can be directly tested against
observational data. In particular, we show that the presence of a thermal bath
warmer than the Hubble scale during inflation decreases the tensor-to-scalar
ratio with respect to the conventional prediction in supercooled inflation,
yielding $r< 8|n_t|$, where $n_t$ is the tensor spectral index. Focusing on
supersymmetric models at low temperatures, we determine consistency relations
between the observables characterizing the spectrum of adiabatic scalar and
tensor modes, both for generic potentials and particular canonical examples,

dissipative effects, thereby generating baryon isocurvature modes that can be

is produced in cold (T_kin < 30 K) and dense (n_H2 > 10^3 cm^-3) molecular gas.
Transitions of other molecules are often detected in our SPIRE/FTS spectra. The
HF J=1-0 transition at 1232 GHz is detected in absorption in UGC05101 and in
emission in NGC7130. In the latter, near-infrared pumping, chemical pumping, or
collisional excitation with electrons are plausible excitation mechanisms
likely related to the AGN of this galaxy. In some galaxies few H2O emission
lines are present. Additionally, three OH+ lines at 909, 971, and 1033 GHz are
identified in NGC7130.

Spectroscopic observations at longer wavelengths will help to constrain its
composition. Methods. We obtained spectroscopy of 1999 JU3 from 0.85 to 2.2
microns, with the 3.6 m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo using the low resolution
mode of the Near Infrared Camera Spectrograph. Results. We present a
near-infrared spectrum of 1999 JU3 from 0.85 to 2.2microns that is consistent
with previously published spectra and with its C-type classification.
Conclusions. Our spectrum confirms the primitive nature of 1999 JU3 and its
interest as target of the sample-return mission Hayabusa 2.

transportation system blending customer-driven vehicles with a taxi service. In
our system, a customer arrives at one of many designated stations and is
transported to any other designated station, either by driving themselves, or
by being driven by an employed driver. The system allows for one-way trips, so
that customers do not have to return to their origin. When some origins and
destinations are more popular than others, vehicles will become unbalanced,
accumulating at some stations and becoming depleted at others. This problem is
addressed by employing rebalancing drivers to drive vehicles from the popular
destinations to the unpopular destinations. However, with this approach the
rebalancing drivers themselves become unbalanced, and we need to ""rebalance the
rebalancers"" by letting them travel back to the popular destinations with a
customer. Accordingly, in this paper we study how to optimally route the
rebalancing vehicles and drivers so that stability (in terms of boundedness of
the number of waiting customers) is ensured while minimizing the number of
rebalancing vehicles traveling in the network and the number of rebalancing
drivers needed; surprisingly, these two objectives are aligned, and one can
find the optimal rebalancing strategy by solving two decoupled linear programs.
Leveraging our analysis, we determine the minimum number of drivers and minimum
number of vehicles needed to ensure stability in the system. Interestingly, our
simulations suggest that, in Euclidean network topologies, one would need
between 1/3 and 1/4 as many drivers as vehicles.

in observing bands centered at roughly 95, 150, and 220 GHz, on angular scales
of $1^\prime \lesssim \theta \lesssim 10^\prime$ (multipole number $1000
\lesssim l \lesssim 10000$). At these frequencies and angular scales, the main
contributions to the bispectrum are expected to be the thermal
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect and emission from extragalactic sources,
predominantly dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) and active galactic nuclei.
We measure the bispectrum in 800 $\mathrm{deg}^2$ of three-band South Pole
Telescope data, and we use a multi-frequency fitting procedure to separate the
bispectrum of the tSZ effect from the extragalactic source contribution. We
simultaneously detect the bispectrum of the tSZ effect at $>$10$\sigma$, the
unclustered component of the extragalactic source bispectrum at $>$5$\sigma$ in
each frequency band, and the bispectrum due to the clustering of DSFGs---i.e.,
the clustered cosmic infrared background (CIB) bispectrum---at $>$5$\sigma$.
This is the first reported detection of the clustered CIB bispectrum. We use
the measured tSZ bispectrum amplitude, compared to model predictions, to
constrain the normalization of the matter power spectrum to be $\sigma_8 =
0.787 \pm 0.031$ and to predict the amplitude of the tSZ power spectrum at $l =
3000$. This prediction improves our ability to separate the thermal and
kinematic contributions to the total SZ power spectrum. The addition of
bispectrum data improves our constraint on the tSZ power spectrum amplitude by
a factor of two compared to power spectrum measurements alone and demonstrates
a preference for a nonzero kinematic SZ (kSZ) power spectrum, with a derived
constraint on the kSZ amplitude at $l=3000$ of A_kSZ $ = 2.9 \pm 1.6 \
\mu$K$^2$, or A_kSZ $ = 2.6 \pm 1.8 \ \mu$K$^2$ if the default A_kSZ > 0 prior
is removed.

observational set-up, data reduction strategy, and a first analysis of the
sizes and structural properties of the HI disks. We find that the HI-rich
galaxies lie on the same HI mass versus HI size relation as normal spiral
galaxies, extending it to total HI masses of $2 \times 10^{10} M_{\odot}$ and
radii R1 of $\sim 100$ kpc (where R1 is defined as the radius where the HI
column density reaches 1 $M_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$). HI-rich galaxies have
significantly larger values of HI-to-optical size ratio at fixed stellar mass,
concentration index, stellar and star formation rate surface density compared
to the control sample. The disks of HI-rich galaxies are also significantly
more clumpy (i.e. have higher HI Gini and $\Delta$Area coefficient) than those
of normal spirals. There is no evidence that the disks of HI-rich galaxies are
more disturbed: HI-rich galaxies exhibit no difference with respect to control
samples in their distributions of HI asymmetry indices or optical/HI disk
position angle differences. In fact, the center of the HI distribution
corresponds more closely with the center of the optical light in the HI-rich
galaxies than in the controls. All these results argue against a scenario in
which new gas has been brought in by mergers. It is possible that they may be
more consistent with cooling from a surrounding quasi-static halo of warm/hot

spirals. We classify these galaxies as blue or red according to their SDSS g-r
colour and use the spectral fitting code VESPA to calculate time-resolved
star-formation histories, metallicity and total starlight dust extinction from
their SDSS fibre spectra. We find that red late-type spirals show less
star-formation in the last 500 Myr than blue late-type spirals by up to a
factor of three, but share similar star-formation histories at earlier times.
This decline in recent star-formation explains their redder colour: their
chemical and dust content are the same. We postulate that red late-type spirals
are recent descendants of blue late-type spirals, with their star-formation
curtailed in the last 500 Myrs. The red late-type spirals are however still
forming stars approximately 17 times faster than red ellipticals over the same
period. Red early-type spirals lie between red late-type spirals and red
ellipticals in terms of recent-to-intermediate star-formation and dust content.
Therefore, it is plausible that these galaxies represent an evolutionary link
between these two populations. They are more likely to evolve directly into red
ellipticals than red late-type spirals. Blue ellipticals show similar
star-formation histories as blue spirals (regardless of type), except they have
formed less stars in the last 100 Myrs. However, blue ellipticals have
different dust content, which peaks at lower extinction values than all spiral

tensor whose conservation encapsulates the hydrodynamical description. For a
generic non-extremal D3-brane, as we move our cutoff surface from the

recover the description in terms of a conformal relativistic fluid encountered
in the AdS/CFT context. We argue that this system allows us therefore to
explore the various connections that have hitherto been suggested relating the
dynamics of gravitational systems and fluid dynamics. In particular, we go on
to show that the blackfold effective field theory approach allows us to capture
this hydrodynamical behaviour and moreover subsumes the constructions
encountered in the fluid/gravity correspondence and the black hole membrane
paradigm, providing thereby a universal language to explore the effective
dynamics of black branes.

that do not break any symmetry. Even without symmetry breaking, the bosons can
still be in many exotic new states of matter, such as symmetry-protected
trivial (SPT) phases which are short-range entangled and symmetry-enriched
topological (SET) phases which are long-range entangled. It is well-known that
non-interacting fermionic topological insulators are SPT states protected by
time-reversal symmetry and U(1) fermion number conservation symmetry. In this
paper, we construct three-dimensional exotic phases of bosons with
time-reversal symmetry and boson number conservation U(1) symmetry by means of
fermionic projective construction. We first construct an algebraic bosonic
insulator which is a symmetric bosonic state with an emergent U(1) gapless
gauge field. We then obtain many gapped bosonic states that do not break the
time-reversal symmetry and boson number conservation via proper dyon
condensations. We identify the constructed states by calculating the allowed
electric and magnetic charges of their excitations, as well as the statistics
and the symmetric transformation properties of those excitations. This allows
us to show that our constructed states can be trivial SPT states (i.e. trivial
Mott insulators of bosons with symmetry), non-trivial SPT states (i.e. bosonic
topological insulators) and SET states (i.e. fractional bosonic topological
insulators). In non-trivial SPT states, the elementary monopole (carrying zero
electric charge but unit magnetic charge) and elementary dyon (carrying both
unit electric charge and unit magnetic charge) are fermionic and bosonic,
respectively. In SET states, intrinsic excitations may carry fractional charge.

smooth density on this interval. Next, we give a criterion on temperature

of integrable PDEs. In particular, Lax pairs for (1+1)-dimensional PDEs can be
interpreted as ZCRs.
  For any (1+1)-dimensional scalar evolution equation $E$, we define a family
of Lie algebras $F(E)$ which are responsible for all ZCRs of $E$ in the
following sense. Representations of the algebras $F(E)$ classify all ZCRs of
the equation $E$ up to local gauge transformations. To achieve this, we find a
normal form for ZCRs with respect to the action of the group of local gauge
transformations.
  As we show in other publications, using these algebras, one obtains some
necessary conditions for integrability of the considered PDEs (where
integrability is understood in the sense of soliton theory) and necessary
conditions for existence of a B\""acklund transformation between two given
equations. Examples of proving non-integrability and applications to obtaining
non-existence results for B\""acklund transformations are presented in other
publications as well.
  In our approach, ZCRs may depend on partial derivatives of arbitrary order,
which may be higher than the order of the equation $E$. The algebras $F(E)$
generalize Wahlquist-Estabrook prolongation algebras, which are responsible for
a much smaller class of ZCRs.
  In this paper we describe general properties of $F(E)$ and present generators
and relations for these algebras. In other publications we study the structure
of $F(E)$ for equations of KdV, Krichever-Novikov, Kaup-Kupershmidt,
Sawada-Kotera types. Among the obtained algebras, one finds
infinite-dimensional Lie algebras of certain matrix-valued functions on
rational and elliptic algebraic curves.

directly from the fundamental quantum GFT dynamics, following the procedure
used in ordinary quantum fluids. The effective dynamics is a non-linear and
non-local extension of quantum cosmology. We also show that any GFT model with
a kinetic term of Laplacian type gives rise, in a semi-classical (WKB)

regarded as being coupled to a strain tensor, which is consistent with the
fluid hypothesis. However, based upon earlier work regarding the geometric
nature of the quantum potential, one can, in fact, define a strain tensor,
which is not, however, due to a deformation of a spatial region, but to a
deformation of a frame field on that region. When one expresses the Madelung
stress tensor as a function of the strain tensor and its derivatives, one then
defines a constitutive law for the Madelung medium that might lead to a more
detailed picture of its elementary structure. It is pointed out that the
resulting constitutive law is strongly analogous to laws that were presented by
Kelvin and Tait for the bending and torsion of elastic wires and plates, as
well as the Einstein equations for gravitation if one takes the viewpoint of
metric elasticity.

drawn from the 3D-HST survey, is flux-limited and was selected to have high
star formation rates based on fits of their broad-band, low spatial resolution
spectral energy distributions. It includes plausible pre-merger (close pairs)
and post-merger (single objects with tidal features) systems, with total
stellar masses and star formation rates derived from multi-wavelength
photometry. Here we use near-infrared slitless spectra from 3D-HST which
produce Halpha or [OIII] emission line maps as proxies for star-formation maps.
This provides a first comprehensive high-resolution, empirical picture of where
star formation occurred in galaxy mergers at the epoch of peak cosmic star
formation rate. We find that detectable star formation can occur in one or both
galaxy centres, or in tidal tails. The most common case (58%) is that star
formation is largely concentrated in a single, compact region, coincident with
the centre of (one of) the merger components. No correlations between star
formation morphology and redshift, total stellar mass, or star formation rate
are found. A restricted set of hydrodynamical merger simulations between
similarly massive and gas-rich objects implies that star formation should be
detectable in both merger components, when the gas fractions of the individual
components are the same. This suggests that z~1.5 mergers typically occur
between galaxies whose gas fractions, masses, and/or star formation rates are
distinctly different from one another.

simulations of the growth of cosmic structure in a way that requires minimal
assumptions about galaxy formation. A galaxy is placed at the potential minimum
of each distinct self-bound subhalo with a luminosity which is a monotonically
increasing function of the maximum mass (or circular velocity) attained over
the subhalo's earlier history. Galaxy and subhalo properties are linked by
matching model and observed luminosity functions. Simulated structures can then
be compared in detail with observation, for example, through galaxy correlation
statistics, group catalogues, or galaxy-galaxy lensing. Robust astrophysical
conclusions can be drawn from such a comparison only on scales which are
unaffected by the numerical limitations of the simulation. Here we compare
results for the Millennium Simulation (MS) with subhalos defined using the
SUBFIND to those obtained applying identical analysis to the much higher
resolution Millennium-II. Correlation statistics on scales between 200 kpc and
2 Mpc converge to within 20% only for subhalos with masses at infall
corresponding to at least 1000 simulation particles in the MS. Numerically
converged results can be obtained to much lower infall particle number, if
galaxies are followed even after their associated subhalos have been tidally
disrupted, as in most recent semi-analytic galaxy formation simulations. This
allows robust comparison between simulation and observation over a wider
dynamic range in mass than for a SHAM analysis which ignores such ""orphan""
galaxies.

redshifts 0.8<z<1.6 with double peaks in either of the high-ionization narrow

intention of identifying high-redshift analogs of the z<0.8 active galactic
nuclei (AGN) with double-peaked [OIII]5007 lines, which might represent AGN
outflows or dual AGN. Lines of high-ionization potential are believed to
originate in the inner, highly photoionized portion of the narrow line region
(NLR), and we exploit this assumption to investigate the possible kinematic
origins of the double-peaked lines. For comparison, we measure the [NeV]3426
and [NeIII]3869 double peaks in low-redshift (z<0.8) [OIII]-selected sources.
We find that [NeV]3426 and [NeIII]3869 show a correlation between
line-splitting and line-width similar to that of [OIII]5007 in other studies;
and the velocity-splittings are correlated with the quasar Eddington ratio.
These results suggest an outflow origin for at least a subset of the
double-peaks, allowing us to study the high-ionization gas kinematics around
quasars. However, we find that a non-neligible fraction of our sample show no
evidence for an ionization stratification. For these sources, the outflow
scenario is less compelling, leaving the dual AGN scenario as a viable
possibility. Finally, we find that our sample shows an anti-correlation between
the velocity-offset ratio and luminosity ratio of the components, which is a
potential dynamical argument for the presence of dual AGN. Therefore, this
study serves as a first attempt at extending the selection of candidate dual
AGN to higher redshifts.

accurate cosmological parameters the effects of mass along the line of sight
must be taken into account. We present a method to achieve this by constraining
the probability distribution function of the effective line of sight
convergence k_ext. The method is based on matching the observed overdensity in
the weighted number of galaxies to that found in mock catalogs with k_ext
obtained by ray-tracing through structure formation simulations. We explore
weighting schemes based on projected distance, mass, luminosity, and redshift.
This additional information reduces the uncertainty of k_ext from sigma_k $0.06
to ~0.04 for very overdense lines of sight like that of the system B1608+656.
For more common lines of sight, sigma_k is reduced to ~<0.03, corresponding to
an uncertainty of ~<3% on distance. This uncertainty has comparable effects on
cosmological parameters to that arising from the mass model of the deflector
and its immediate environment. Photometric redshifts based on g, r, i and K
photometries are sufficient to constrain k_ext almost as well as with
spectroscopic redshifts. As an illustration, we apply our method to the system
B1608+656. Our most reliable k_ext estimator gives sigma_k=0.047 down from
0.065 using only galaxy counts. Although deeper multi-band observations of the
field of B1608+656 are necessary to obtain a more precise estimate, we conclude
that griK photometry, in addition to spectroscopy to characterize the immediate
environment, is an effective way to increase the precision of time-delay
cosmography.

hypercharge flux restriction to matter curves. We show that local F-theory
models with anomalies of type U(1)_Y-U(1)^2 in the massless spectrum can be
consistent only if such additional U(1)s are globally geometrically massive (in
the sense that they arise from non-Kahler deformations of the Calabi-Yau
four-fold). Further, in such cases of geometrically massive U(1)s hypercharge
flux can induce new anomalies of type U(1)_Y^2-U(1) in the massless spectrum,
violating constraints in local models forbidding such anomalies. In particular
this implies that it is possible to construct models exhibiting a U(1)_{PQ}
global symmetry which have hypercharge flux doublet-triplet splitting and no
further exotics. We also show that the known hypercharge flux induced splitting
of the gauge couplings in IIB models at tree-level can be reduced by a factor
of 5 by employing a more F-theoretic twisting of U(1) flux by hypercharge flux
bringing it to well within MSSM 2-loop results. In the case of net restriction
of hypercharge flux to matter curves this tree-level splitting becomes more
involved, is tied to the vacuum expectation values of certain closed-string
fields, and therefore gauge coupling unification becomes tied to the question
of moduli stabilisation.

formation is intricately related to the nature of sub-photospheric magnetic
fields. Aims : We study the formation of a penumbra in a decaying sunspot and
compare its properties with those seen during the development of a proto-spot.
Methods : High-resolution spectropolarimetric observations of active region
NOAA 11283 were obtained from the spectro-polarimeter on board Hinode. These
were complemented with full-disk filtergrams of continuum intensity,
line-of-sight magnetograms, and dopplergrams from the Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager at high cadence. Results : The formation of a penumbra in the decaying
sunspot occurs after the coalescence of the sunspot with a magnetic
fragment/pore, which initially formed in the quiet Sun close to an emerging
flux region. At first, a smaller set of penumbral filaments develop near the
location of the merger with very bright penumbral grains with intensities of
1.2 I_QS, upflows of 4 km/s, and a lifetime of 10 hr. During the decay of these
filaments, a larger segment of a penumbra forms at the location of the
coalescence. These new filaments are characterized by nearly supersonic
downflows of 6.5 km/s that change to a regular Evershed flow nearly 3 hr later.
Conclusions : The coalescence of the pore with the decaying sunspot provided
sufficient magnetic flux for the penumbra to form in the sunspot. The emerging
flux region could have played a decisive role in this process because the
formation occurred at the location of the merger and not on the opposite side
of the sunspot.

studying persistent currents in closed rings by exact diagonalization, it is
found that the contribution to the current due to the RSOC V_{SO}, for a fixed
value of the Hubbard repulsion U reaches a maximum at intermediate values of
V_{SO}. By increasing the repulsive Hubbard coupling U, this spin-flipping
current is suppressed and eventually it becomes opposite to the spin-conserving

spin polarization between the two legs of the ladder is enhanced by U. Similar
results for this Hubbard-Rashba model are observed for a completely different

the ensuing time-dependent regime is studied by the density
matrix-renormalization group technique. It is also interesting a combined
effect between V_{SO} and U leading to a strong enhancement of
antiferromagnetic order which in turn may explain the observed behavior of the

limits the usefulness of optical techniques for sensing and imaging. Thus,
methods for increasing the transmission of light through such random media are
of interest. Against this backdrop, recent theoretical and experimental
advances have suggested the existence of a few highly transmitting
eigen-wavefronts with transmission coefficients close to one in strongly
backscattering random media.
  Here, we numerically analyze this phenomenon in 2-D with fully spectrally
accurate simulators and provide rigorous numerical evidence confirming the
existence of these highly transmitting eigen-wavefronts in random media with
periodic boundary conditions that is composed of hundreds of thousands of
non-absorbing scatterers.
  Motivated by bio-imaging applications where it is not possible to measure the
transmitted fields, we develop physically realizable algorithms for increasing
the transmission through such random media using backscatter analysis. We show
via numerical simulations that the algorithms converge rapidly, yielding a
near-optimum wavefront in just a few iterations. We also develop an algorithm
that combines the knowledge of these highly transmitting eigen-wavefronts
obtained from backscatter analysis, with intensity measurements at a point to
produce a near-optimal focus with significantly fewer measurements than a
method that does not utilize this information.

the retarded Green's function G of an interacting system, as exemplified by the
extended Hubbard model. In particular: (1) due to an incompatibility between
interactions of nearly any form and a precise definition of series propagation,
degenerate geometric nodes are split or lifted by interactions; (2) degenerate
nodes generically exist at the boundary between regimes of node splitting and
node lifting and, in the presence of interactions, they require fine-tuning;
(3) degenerate nodes are highly sensitive to perturbation and their sensitivity
increases with their degeneracy. Moreover, for high degeneracies there is a
tendency toward lifting rather than splitting.
  We also propose a characterization of the node structure in extended Hubbard
models at arbitrary filling in terms of either the eigenvalues of G, or
equivalently, the roots of a polynomial. This shows that ""Mott nodes""
previously predicted to occur in the transmission spectra of molecular radicals
are fundamentally associated with nodes in the eigenvalues of the retarded
Green's function that occur in open-shelled systems. This is accompanied by a

distinct mass, angular momentum, and temperature. This allows us to probe
several tens of thousand years of the disk's initial evolution, during which we
observe multiple episodes of fragmentation leading to the formation of
gravitationally bound gaseous clumps within spiral arms. These fragments are
torqued inward due to gravitational interaction with the spiral arms on
timescales of 10^3 - 10^4 yr and accreted onto the growing protostar, giving
rise to accretion and luminosity bursts. The burst phenomenon is fueled by
continuing accretion of material falling onto the disk from the collapsing
parent core, which replenishes the mass lost by the disk due to accretion, and
triggers repetitive episodes of disk fragmentation. We show that the burst
phenomenon is expected to occur for a wide spectrum of initial conditions in
primordial pre-stellar cores and speculate on how the intense luminosities

variables (exceeding 0.4 mag root-mean-squared) more likely to have

framework for processing large amount of data, such as spam detection, and

challenging questions in such environments are (1) choosing suitable values for
MapReduce configuration parameters e.g., number of mappers, number of reducers,
and DFS block size, and (2) predicting the amount of resources that a user
should lease from the service provider. Currently, the tasks of both choosing
configuration parameters and estimating required resources are solely the users
responsibilities. In this paper, we present an approach to provision the total
CPU usage in clock cycles of jobs in MapReduce environment. For a MapReduce
job, a profile of total CPU usage in clock cycles is built from the job past
executions with different values of two configuration parameters e.g., number
of mappers, and number of reducers. Then, a polynomial regression is used to
model the relation between these configuration parameters and total CPU usage
in clock cycles of the job. We also briefly study the influence of input data
scaling on measured total CPU usage in clock cycles. This derived model along
with the scaling result can then be used to provision the total CPU usage in
clock cycles of the same jobs with different input data size. We validate the
accuracy of our models using three realistic applications (WordCount, Exim
MainLog parsing, and TeraSort). Results show that the predicted total CPU usage
in clock cycles of generated resource provisioning options are less than 8% of
the measured total CPU usage in clock cycles in our 20-node virtual Hadoop

two-dimensional critical systems, focusing on a generic boundary perturbation
by the stress-tensor of the underlying conformal field theory (CFT). In the
particular case of an angle $2\pi$, we find that there is an unusual correction
of the form $L^{-1}\log L$, where $L$ is a typical length scale in the system.
This correction also affects the one-point function of an operator near the
corner. The prefactor can be seen as semi-universal, in the sense that it
depends on a \emph{single} non-universal quantity, the extrapolation length.
Once this ultraviolet cutoff is known, the term is entirely fixed by the
geometry of the system, and the central charge of the CFT. Such a corner
appears for example in the bipartite fidelity of a one-dimensional quantum
system at criticality, which allows for several numerical checks in free
fermions systems. We also present an exact result in the XX and Ising chains
that confirms this analysis. Finally, we consider applications to the time
evolution of the (logarithmic) Loschmidt echo and the entanglement entropy
following a local quantum quench. Due to subtle issues in analytic
continuation, we find that the logarithmic term in imaginary time transforms
into a time-dependent $L^{-2}$ correction for the entanglement entropy, and a
$L^{-2}\log L$ term for the Loschmidt echo.

provides an efficient way to deal with filters with large number of elements.
It consists of a bank of full-rank adaptive filters that forms a transformation
matrix and an adaptive reduced-rank filter that operates at the output of the
bank of filters. The transformation matrix projects the received vector onto a
low-dimension vector, which is processed by the reduced-rank filter to estimate
the desired signal. The expressions of the transformation matrix and the

has been studied by means of a Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) operated
under ambient conditions, and by Photoluminescence (PL) analysis. Thousands of
current-voltage characteristics have been measured at different spots of the
sample showing the typical behavior of a semiconductor. The analysis of the
curves allows us to construct a gap distribution histogram which reassembles
the PL spectrum of this compound. Our analysis shows that in the TPD films most
of the observed distribution of the gap comes mainly from an uncertainty in the
position of the LUMO levels of the molecular compound as would be expected from
theory. This analysis demonstrates that STM can give relevant information, not
only related to the expected value of a semiconductor gap, but also on its
distribution which affects its physical properties such as the case of the PL
and absorption distributions as here is reported.

is accreting material from a low mass companion. The importance of this
accretion takes on added significance if the WD can increase its mass to reach
the Chandrasekhar limit thus exploding as a Type Ia supernova. In this study we
accrete material of Solar composition onto carbon-oxygen white dwarfs of 0.70,
1.00 and 1.35 Msun with accretion rates from 1.6e-10 to 1.6e-6 Msun per yr. We
have utilized the MESA stellar evolution code for our modeling and evolve them
for many nova cycles or, in some cases, evolution to a red giant stage.
Differing behaviors occur as a function of both the WD mass and the accretion
rate. For the lower WD masses, the models undergo recurrent hydrogen flashes at
low accretion rates; for higher accretion rates, steady-burning of hydrogen
occurs and eventually gives way to recurrent hydrogen flashes. At the highest
accretion rates, these models go through a steady-burning phase but eventually
transition into red giants. For the highest white dwarf mass recurrent hydrogen
flashes occur at lower accretion rates but for higher rates the models exhibit
steady-burning interspersed with helium flashes. We find that for all our
models that undergo recurrent hydrogen flashes, as well as the steady-burning
models that exhibit helium flashes, the mass of the WD continues to grow toward
the Chandrasekhar limit. These results suggest that the accretion of Solar
abundance material onto carbon-oxygen white dwarfs in cataclysmic variable
systems, the single degenerate scenario, is a viable channel for progenitors of
Type Ia supernova explosions.

have previously been solved, such as the state-feedback case or the case where
the dynamics of both systems are decoupled. In this paper, we present a
detailed solution to the general case. The structure of the optimal
decentralized controller is reminiscent of that of the optimal centralized
controller; each player must estimate the state of the system given their
available information and apply static control policies to these estimates to
compute the optimal controller. The previously solved cases benefit from a
separation between estimation and control which allows one to compute the
control and estimation gains separately. This feature is not present in
general, and some of the gains must be solved for simultaneously. We show that
computing the required coupled estimation and control gains amounts to solving
a small system of linear equations.

LTLFO, and a corresponding monitor construction based on a new type of

  Specifically, we show that monitoring a specification in LTLFO boils down to
an undecidable decision problem. The proof of this result revolves around
specific ideas on what we consider a ""proper"" monitor. As these ideas are
general, we outline them first in the setting of standard LTL, before lifting
them to the setting of first-order logic and LTLFO. Although due to the above
result one cannot hope to obtain a complete monitor for LTLFO, we prove the
soundness of our automata-based construction and give experimental results from
an implementation. These seem to substantiate our hypothesis that the
automata-based construction leads to efficient runtime monitors whose size does
not grow with increasing trace lengths (as is often observed in similar
approaches). However, we also discuss formulae for which growth is unavoidable,

establish a robust method that can be implemented for studying similar states

grid energy or harvested energy supply only, and then combine the results to
obtain the optimal structure of the coexisting system. Specifically, the
reverse multi-stage WF policy is proposed to achieve the optimal power

online schemes are proposed, of which the performance is evaluated by numerical

confirmed by a large number of observation data, that is consistent with the
result calculated by Einstein's gravity. F(R)-gravity is the modification of
Einstein's gravity. According to the field equations obtained by the action of
the f(R) form, we get a similar Schwarzschild metric. According to the
condition that four-dimension momenta of the photon return to zero and that of
conservation of covariant momenta, we obtain the equation of motion of the
photon in a specific form of f (R)-gravity. We solve the equation to get the
gravitational deflection angle of light that grazes the surface of sun and the

redshift space. They find a small net blue-shift for the cluster galaxies
relative to the brightest cluster galaxies, which agrees quite well with the
gravitational redshift from GR. Zhao {\it et al.} have pointed out that, in
addition to the gravitational redshift, one would expect to see transverse
Doppler (TD) redshifts, and that these two effects are generally of the same
order. Here we show that there are other corrections that are also of the same
order of magnitude. The fact that we observe galaxies on our past light cone
results in a bias such that more of the galaxies observed are moving away from
us in the frame of the cluster than are moving towards us. This causes the
observed average redshift to be $\langle \delta z \rangle = -\langle \Phi
\rangle + \langle \beta^2 \rangle / 2 + \langle \beta_x^2 \rangle$, with
$\beta_x$ is the line of sight velocity. That is if we average over galaxies
with equal weight. If the galaxies in each cluster are weighted by their
fluence, or equivalently if we do not resolve the moving sources, and make an
average of the mean redshift giving equal weight per photon, the observed
redshift is then opposite to the usual transverse Doppler effect. In the WHH
experiment, the weighting is a step-function because of the flux-limit for
inclusion in the spectroscopic sample and the result is different again, and
depends on the details of the luminosity function and the SEDs of the galaxies.
Including these effects substantially modifies the blue-shift profile. We show
that in-fall and out-flow have very small effect over the relevant range of
impact parameters but become important on larger scales.

reduced numbers of processor bits for the encoder and lower PAPR values. We

well-known, drug-resistance mutations, but the underlying population genetic
processes are not well understood. By analyzing within-patient longitudinal
sequence data, we make four observations that shed a light on the underlying
processes and allow us infer the short-term effective population size of the
viral population in a patient. Our first observation is that the evolution of
drug resistance usually occurs by the fixation of one drug-resistance mutation
at a time, as opposed to several changes simultaneously. Second, we find that
these fixation events are accompanied by a reduction in genetic diversity in
the region surrounding the fixed drug-resistance mutation, due to the
hitchhiking effect. Third, we observe that the fixation of drug-resistance
mutations involves both hard and soft selective sweeps. In a hard sweep, a
resistance mutation arises in a single viral particle and drives all linked
mutations with it when it spreads in the viral population, which dramatically
reduces genetic diversity. On the other hand, in a soft sweep, a resistance
mutation occurs multiple times on different genetic backgrounds, and the
reduction of diversity is weak. Using the frequency of occurrence of hard and
soft sweeps we estimate the effective population size of HIV to be 1.5 * 10^5
(95% confidence interval 0.8 * 10^5, 4.8 * 10^5). This number is much lower
than the actual number of infected cells, but much larger than previous
population size estimates based on synonymous diversity. We propose several
explanations for the observed discrepancies. Finally, our fourth observation is
that genetic diversity at non-synonymous sites recovers to its pre-fixation
value within 18 months, whereas diversity at synonymous sites remains depressed
after this time period.

protect against disk (node) failures. A node is said to have capacity $l$ over

An $(n,k,l)$ MDS code uses $n$ nodes of capacity $l$ to store $k$ information
nodes. The MDS property guarantees the resiliency to any $n-k$ node failures.
An \emph{optimal bandwidth} (resp. \emph{optimal access}) MDS code communicates
(resp. accesses) the minimum amount of data during the repair process of a
single failed node. It was shown that this amount equals a fraction of
$1/(n-k)$ of data stored in each node. In previous optimal bandwidth
constructions, $l$ scaled polynomially with $k$ in codes with asymptotic rate
$<1$. Moreover, in constructions with a constant number of parities, i.e. rate
approaches 1, $l$ is scaled exponentially w.r.t. $k$. In this paper, we focus
on the later case of constant number of parities $n-k=r$, and ask the following
question: Given the capacity of a node $l$ what is the largest number of

In bound pair dynamics picture, nonzero Hall conductivity emerges when

direction of external perturbation. Such effect arises from the broken time
reversal symmetry nature of a chiral p-wave superconducting state and does not
require an applied magnetic field. A frequency-dependent matrix dielectric
function $\epsilon(\omega)$ is derived to describe the screening effect due to
the pair polarization. Quantities related to the Hall conductivity and power
dissipation, denoted as $\epsilon^{-1}_\perp$ and $\Im

reversal as a function of frequency close to transition temperature, as well as
in the temperature domain at various fixed frequencies. The latter shows peak
structure near transition temperature. These features are attributed to

Using Monte Carlo simulation combined with forward flux sampling, we find that
for a weak external field the nucleation rate decreases monotonically as degree
heterogeneity increases. Interestingly, for a relatively strong external field
the nucleation rate exhibits a nonmonotonic dependence on degree heterogeneity,
in which there exists a maximal nucleation rate at an intermediate level of
degree heterogeneity. Furthermore, we develop a heterogeneous mean-field theory
for evaluating the free-energy barrier of nucleation. The theoretical

galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7. The galaxies
in our sample are visually classified into galaxies hosting long or short bars,
and non-barred galaxies. We find that the spin distributions of these three
classes are statistically different, with galaxies hosting long bars with the
lowest $\lambda_{d}$ values, followed by non-barred galaxies, while galaxies
with short bars present typically high spin parameters. The bar fraction
presents its maximum at low to intermediate $\lambda_{d}$ values for the case
of long bars, while the maximum for short bars is at high $\lambda_{d}$. This
bi-modality is in good agreement with previous studies finding longer bars
hosted by luminous, massive, red galaxies with low content of cold gas, while
short bars are found in low luminosity, low mass, blue galaxies, usually gas
rich. In addition, the rise and fall of the bar fraction as a function of
$\lambda_{d}$, within the long-bar sample, shown in our results, can be
explained as a result of two competing factors: the self-gravity of the disk
that enhances bar instabilities, and the support by random motions instead of
ordered rotational motion, that prevents the formation/growth of bars.

the inner planet that hosts the smallest number of known co-orbitals (two):
(322756) 2001 CK32 and 2002 VE68. Both objects have absolute magnitudes 18 < H
< 21 and were identified as Venus co-orbitals in 2004. Here, we analyse the
orbit of the recently discovered asteroid 2012 XE133 with H = 23.5 mag to
conclude that it is a new Venus co-orbital currently following a transitional
trajectory between Venus' Lagrangian points L5 and L3. The object could have
been a 1:1 librator for several thousand years and it may leave the resonance
with Venus within the next few hundred years, after a close encounter with the
Earth. Our calculations show that its dynamical status as co-orbital, as well
as that of the two previously known Venus co-orbitals, is controlled by the
Earth-Moon system with Mercury playing a secondary role. The three temporary
co-orbitals follow rather chaotic but similar trajectories with e-folding times
of the order of 100 yr. Out of the three co-orbitals, 2012 XE133 currently
follows the most perturbed path. An actual collision with the Earth during the
next 10000 yr cannot be discarded. Extrapolation of the number distribution of
Venus co-orbitals as a function of the absolute magnitude suggests that dozens
of objects similar to 2012 XE133 could be transient companions to Venus. Some
additional objects that were or will be transient co-orbitals to Venus are also
briefly discussed.

processes can be mediated by tree-level heavy neutral scalars and/or
pseudo-scalars H^0(A^0). This generally introduces new sources of flavour
violation and CP violation as well as left-handed and right-handed scalar
currents. These new physics contributions imply a pattern of deviations from SM
expectations for FCNC processes that depends only on the couplings of H^0(A^0)
to fermions and on their masses. In situations in which a single H^0 or A^0
dominates NP contributions stringent correlations between Delta F=2 and Delta
F=1 observables exist. Anticipating the Flavour Precision Era ahead of us we
illustrate this by searching for allowed oases in the landscape of a given
model assuming significantly smaller uncertainties in CKM and hadronic
parameters than presently available. To this end we analyze Delta F=2
observables in B^0_{s,d}-bar B^0_{s,d} and K^0-bar K^0 systems and rare B and K
decays with charged leptons in the final state including both left-handed and
right-handed scalar couplings of H^0 and A^0 to quarks in various combinations.
We identify a number of correlations between various flavour observables that
could test and distinguish these different scenarios. The prominent role of the
decays B_{s,d}-> mu^+ mu^- in these studies is emphasized. Imposing the
existing flavour constraints, a rich pattern of deviations from the SM
expectations in rare B_{s,d} decays emerges provided M_H< 1 TeV. NP effects in
rare K decays are very small. Neutral SM Higgs contributions to rare B and K
decays turn out to be negligible once the constraints from Delta F=2 processes
are taken into account. Finally, we point out striking differences between the
correlations found here and in scenarios in which tree-level FCNC are mediated
by a new neutral gauge boson Z'.

the initiation and development of atherosclerosis and arterial pathologies.
Traditional clinical evaluation of arterial condition relies on correlations of
WSS parameters with average flow rate (Q) and heart rate (HR) measurements. We
show that for pulsating flow waveforms in a straight tube with flow reversals
that lead to significant reciprocating WSS, the measurements of HR and Q are
not sufficient for prediction of WSS parameters. Therefore, we suggest adding a
third quantity - known as the pulsatility index (PI) - which is defined as the
peak-to-peak flow rate amplitude normalized by Q. We examine several pulsating
flow waveforms with and without flow reversals using a simulation of a
Womersley model in a straight rigid tube and validate the simulations through
experimental study using particle image velocimetry (PIV). The results indicate
that clinically relevant WSS parameters such as the percentage of negative WSS
(P[%]), oscillating shear index (OSI) and the ratio of minimum to maximum shear
stress rates (min/max), are better predicted when the PI is used in conjunction
with HR and Q. Therefore, we propose to use PI as an additional and essential
diagnostic quantity for improved predictability of the reciprocating WSS.

R}^n,\: n \geq 3$, $n$ odd, in a smooth connected exterior domain $\Omega :=
{\mathbb R}^n \setminus \bar{K}$. Assume that the rank of $A(\xi) = \sum_{j=
1}^n A_j \xi_j$ is constant for $\xi \not= 0.$ For maximally dissipative
boundary conditions on $\Omega :={\mathbb R}^n \setminus \bar{K}$ with bounded
open domain $K$ the solution of the boundary problem in ${\mathbb R}^{+} \times
\Omega$ is described by a contraction semigroup $V(t) = e^{t G_b},\:t \geq 0.$
Assuming coercive conditions for $G_b$ and its adjoint $G_b^*$ on the
complement of their kernels, we prove that the spectrum of $G_b$ in the open
half plane $\Re z < 0$ is formed only by isolated eigenvalues with finite
multiplicities.

around Herbig Ae/Be and T-Tauri stars obtained within the Herschel key
programme DIGIT. In this paper we focus on the 69mu emission band of the
crystalline silicate forsterite.
  Aims: This work provides an overview of the 69mu forsterite bands in the
DIGIT sample. We aim to derive the temperature and composition of the
forsterite grains. With this information, constraints can be placed on the
spatial distribution of the forsterite in the disk and its formation history.
  Methods: Position and shape of the 69mu band are used to derive the
temperature and composition of the dust by comparison to laboratory spectra of
that band. We combine our data with existing Spitzer IRS spectra to compare the
presence and strength of the 69mu band to the forsterite bands at shorter
wavelengths.
  Results: A total of 32 sources have been observed, 8 of them show a 69mu
emission band that can be attributed to forsterite. With the exception of the
T-Tauri star AS205, all of the detections are for disks associated with Herbig
Ae/Be stars. Most of the forsterite grains that give rise to the 69mu bands are
warm (~100-200 K) and iron-poor (less than ~2% iron). Only AB-Aur requires
approximately 3-4% of iron.
  Conclusions: Our findings support the hypothesis that the forsterite grains
form through an equilibrium condensation process at high temperatures. The
connection between the strength of the 69 and 33mu bands shows that at least
part of the emission in these bands originates from the same dust grains.
Further, any model that explains the PACS and the Spitzer IRS observations must
take the effects of a wavelength dependent optical depth into account. We find
indications of a correlation of the detection rate of the 69mu band with the
spectral type of the host stars. However, our sample is too small to obtain a
definitive result.

The sign of the magnetoresistance (MR) changes from negative to positive at a

inherent sparseness, that is, they are formed from components that are mutually
separated by low-electron-density regions where dispersive forces contribute
significantly to the cohesion and behavior. The introduction of, for example,
the van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) method [PRL 92, 246401 (2004)]
has addressed part of this sparse-matter system challenge. However, while a
vdW-DF study is often as computationally efficient as a study performed in the
generalized gradient approximation, the scope of large-sparse-matter DFT is
still limited by computer time and memory. It is costly to self-consistently
determine the electron wavefunctions and hence the kinetic-energy repulsion. In
this paper we propose and evaluate an adaption of the Harris scheme [PRB 31,

might be advantageous to first reformulate QCD in terms of gauge-invariant
dynamical variables, before applying any approximation schemes. Using a
canonical transformation of the dynamical variables, which Abelianises the
non-Abelian Gauss-law constraints to be implemented, such a reformulation can
be achieved for QCD. The exact implementation of the Gauss laws reduces the
colored spin-1 gluons and spin-1/2 quarks to unconstrained colorless spin-0,
spin-1, spin-2 and spin-3 glueball fields and colorless Rarita-Schwinger fields
respectively. The obtained physical Hamiltonian can then be rewritten into a
form, which separates the rotational from the scalar degrees of freedom, and
admits a systematic strong-coupling expansion in powers of lambda=g^{-2/3},
equivalent to an expansion in the number of spatial derivatives. The
leading-order term in this expansion corresponds to non-interacting
hybrid-glueballs, whose low-lying masses can be calculated with high accuracy
by solving the Schr\""odinger-equation of the Dirac-Yang-Mills quantum mechanics
of spatially constant physical fields (at the moment only for the 2-color
case). Due to the presence of classical zero-energy valleys of the
chromomagnetic potential for two arbitrarily large classical glueball fields
(the unconstrained analogs of the well-known constant Abelian fields),
practically all glueball excitation energy is expected to go into the increase
of the strengths of these two fields. Higher-order terms in lambda lead to
interactions between the hybrid-glueballs and can be taken into account
systematically using perturbation theory in lambda.

cylindrical coordinates for 3-D axisymmetric systems. The time evolution is
treated by a splitting scheme in coordinate space using alternate direction
iteration, while the wave function is discretized spatially on a uniform grid.
The longitudinal coordinate evolution is performed exactly by the method of
characteristics while the radial coordinates evolution uses Poisson's integral
solution, which allows to implement the radial symmetry of the wave function.
The latter is evaluated on a time staggered mesh by using Hermite polynomial
interpolation and by performing the integration analytically. The cylindrical
coordinate singularity problem at $r=0$ is circumvented by this method as the
integral is well-defined at the origin. The resulting scheme is reminiscent of
non-standard finite differences. In the last step of the splitting, the
remaining equation has a solution in terms of a time-ordered exponential, which
is approximated to a higher order than the time evolution scheme. We study the
time evolution of Gaussian wave packets, and we evaluate the eigenstates of
hydrogen-like systems by using a spectral method. We compare the numerical
results to analytical solutions to validate the method. In addition, we present

Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements by the Planck satellite, offers
an unprecedented opportunity to constrain the inflationary theory. This is
however a challenging project given the size of the inflationary landscape
which contains hundreds of different scenarios. Given that there is currently
no observational evidence for primordial non-Gaussianities, isocurvature
perturbations or any other non-minimal extension of the inflationary paradigm,
a reasonable approach is to consider the simplest models first, namely the
slow-roll single field models with minimal kinetic terms. This still leaves us
with a very populated landscape, the exploration of which requires new and
efficient strategies. It has been customary to tackle this problem by means of
approximate model independent methods while a more ambitious alternative is to
study the inflationary scenarios one by one. We have developed the new publicly
available runtime library ASPIC to implement this last approach. The ASPIC code
provides all routines needed to quickly derive reheating consistent observable
predictions within this class of scenarios. ASPIC has been designed as an
evolutive code which presently supports 118 different models, a number that may
be compared with three or four representing the present state of the art. In
this paper, for each of the ASPIC models, we present and collect new results in
a systematic manner, thereby constituting the first Encyclopaedia
Inflationaris.

will describe how the elliptic genus can be represented as a linear combination
of certain absolutely convergent Poincar\'e series, against which F can be
unfolded. The result can be expressed as a sum of one-loop contributions of
perturbative BPS-states in a manifestly T-duality invariant fashion, valid at
any point of (the perturbative) moduli space. Within this framework, the
singularity structure of amplitudes around points of gauge symmetry enhancement
becomes crystal clear and a series of applications is given in order to better
illustrate the power of this approach.

formation history received a boost from a number of synoptic surveys. There has
been a recent claim of a mismatch by a factor of two between star formation and
core collapse SN rates, and different explanations have been proposed for this
discrepancy.} We attempted an independent test of the relation between star
formation and supernova rates in the extreme environment of starburst galaxies,
where both star formation and extinction are extremely high. To this aim we
conducted an infrared supernova search in a sample of local starburts galaxies.
The rational to search in the infrared is to reduce the bias due to extinction,
which is one of the putative reasons for the observed discrepancy between star
formation and supernova rates. To evaluate the outcome of the search we
developed a MonteCarlo simulation tool that is used to predict the number and
properties of the expected supernovae based on the search characteristics and
the current understanding of starburst galaxies and supernovae. During the
search we discovered 6 supernovae (4 with spectroscopic classification) which
is in excellent agreement with the prediction of the MonteCarlo simulation tool
that is, on average, $5.3\pm2.3$ events. The number of supernovae detected in
starburst galaxies is consistent with that predicted from their high star
formation rate when we recognize that a major fraction ($\sim 60%$) of the
events remains hidden in the unaccessible, high density nuclear regions because
of a combination of reduced search efficiency and high extinction.

directly from the contest organization, and decreased in speed when hearing
from less personal source types (e.g. family vs. media). Mobilization was
faster when the recruiter and the recruit heard about the contest through the

Females mobilized other females faster than males mobilized other males.
Younger recruiters mobilized others faster, and older recruits mobilized

Extragalactic Survey (VIPERS). We estimate the galaxy stellar mass function at
several epochs discussing in detail the amount of cosmic variance affecting our
estimate. We find that Poisson noise and cosmic variance of the galaxy mass
function in the VIPERS survey are comparable with the statistical uncertainties
of large surveys in the local universe. VIPERS data allow us to determine with
unprecedented accuracy the high-mass tail of the galaxy stellar mass function,
which includes a significant number of galaxies that are usually too rare to
detect with any of the past spectroscopic surveys. At the epochs sampled by
VIPERS, massive galaxies had already assembled most of their stellar mass. We
apply a photometric classification in the (U-V) rest-frame colour to compute
the mass function of blue and red galaxies, finding evidence for the evolution
of their contribution to the total number density budget: the transition mass
above which red galaxies dominate is found to be about 10^10.4 M_sun at z=0.55
and evolves proportionally to (1+z)^3. We are able to trace separately the
evolution of the number density of blue and red galaxies with masses above
10^11.4 M_sun, in a mass range barely studied in previous work. We find that
for such large masses, red galaxies show a milder evolution with redshift, when
compared to objects at lower masses. At the same time, we detect a population
of similarly massive blue galaxies, which are no longer detectable below z=0.7.
These results show the improved statistical power of VIPERS data, and give
initial promising indications of mass-dependent quenching of galaxies at z~1.

selected materials. Large values for these quantities are found when the
material is in the vicinity of a phase transition. Quite often there is
coupling between different degrees of freedom, and the material can exhibit
cross-response to different external fields. In this case, the material can
exhibit either conventional or inverse caloric effects when a field is applied.
The values reported for the many caloric effects at moderate fields are large
enough to envisage future application of these materials in efficient and
environmental friendly refrigeration.

spin-imbalanced popula- tions of attractive fermions in square lattices. The
phases are systematically characterized by the symmetry of the order parameter
and the real- and momentum-space structures using Hartree- Fock-Bogoliubov
theory. We find several type of unidirectional Larkin-Ovchinikov-type phases.
We discuss the effect of commensuration between the ordering wave vector and
the density imbalance, and describe the mechanism of Fermi surface
reconstruction and pairing for various orders. A robust supersolid phase is
shown to exist when the ordering wave vector is diagonally directed.

  resonators","8 pages",,,,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Optical frequency conversion processes in nonlinear materials are limited in
wavelength by the accessible phase matching and the required high pump powers.
In this letter, we report a novel broadband phase matching (PM) technique in
high quality factor (Q) whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators made of
birefringent crystalline materials. This technique relies on two interacting
WGMs, one with constant and the other with spatially oscillating phase
velocity. Thus, phase matching occurs cyclically. The technique can be
implemented with a WGM resonator with its disk plane parallel to the optic axis
of the crystal. With a single beta barium borate (BBO) resonator in that
configuration, we experimentally demonstrated efficient second harmonic
generation (SHG) to harmonic wavelengths from 780 nm in the near infrared to
317 nm in the ultraviolet (UV). The observed SHG conversion efficiency is as
high as 4.6% (mW)-1. This broadband PM technique opens a new way for nonlinear
optics applications in WGM resonators. This work is also the first reported
continuous wave UV generation by direct SHG in a WGM resonator

ground level by a worldwide network of cosmic ray detectors. These sporadic
events are associated with solar flares and are assumed to be of a quasi-random
nature. Their study gives us information about their source and propagation
processes, about the maximum capacity of the sun as a particle accelerator
engine, about the magnetic structure of the medium traversed, etc. Space
vehicles may be damaged by this kind of radiation, as well as electric
transformers and gas pipes at high latitudes. As a result, their prediction has
turned out to be very important, but because of their random occurrence, up to
now few efforts to this end have been made. The results of these efforts have
been limited to possible warnings in real time, just before GLE occurrence, but
no specific dates have been predicted well enough in advance to prevent
possible hazards. In this study we show that, in spite of the quasi-stochastic
nature of GLEs, it is possible to predict them with relative precision, even
for future solar cycles. We reproduce previous GLE events and present results
for future events.

altogether new formation theory that might help explain the puzzling
dissimilarities between them and the standard type Ia supernovae. The most
striking aspect of the observational analysis is the necessity of invoking
super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs having masses ~ 2.1-2.8M_sun, M_sun being the
mass of Sun, as their most probable progenitors. Strongly magnetized white
dwarfs having super-Chandrasekhar masses were already established to be
potential candidates for the progenitors of peculiar type Ia supernovae. Owing
to the Landau quantization of the underlying electron degenerate gas,
theoretical results yielded the observationally inferred mass range. Here we
sketch a possible evolutionary scenario by which super-Chandrasekhar white
dwarfs could be formed by accretion on to a commonly observed magnetized white
dwarf, invoking the phenomenon of flux freezing. This opens the multiple
possible evolutions ending in supernova explosions of super-Chandrasekhar white
dwarfs having masses within the range stated above. We point out that our
proposal has observational support, like, the recent discovery of a large
number of magnetized white dwarfs by SDSS.

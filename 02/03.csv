bulk enclosed by metallic surfaces, and detailed theoretical predictions about
the surface state band topology and spin texture are available. While several
topological insulator materials are currently known, the existence and topology
of these metallic states have only ever been probed for one particular surface
orientation of a given material. For most topological insulators, such as
Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$ and Bi$_2$Se$_3$, this surface is the closed-packed (111)
surface and it supports one topologically guaranteed surface state Dirac cone.
Here we experimentally realise a non closed-packed surface of a topological
insulator, Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$(110), and probe the surface state topology by
angle-resolved photoemission. As expected, this surface also supports metallic
states but the change in surface orientation drastically modifies the band
topology, leading to three Dirac cones instead of one, in excellent agreement
with the theoretical predictions but in contrast to any other experimentally
studied TI surface. This illustrates the possibility to tailor the basic
topological properties of the surface via its crystallographic direction. Here
it introduces a valley degree of freedom not previously achieved for
topological insulator systems.

gravity-free flat space-times whose metric depends upon the value of the group
parameter. An experimental determination of this value has been proposed. If it
is zero, the metric is Minkowski's. If it is non-zero, the metric is not
Poincare invariant and local frequencies of electromagnetic waves change as
they propagate. If the group parameter is positive, velocity independent red
shifts develop and the group parameter plays a role similar to that of Hubble's
constant in determining the relation of these redshifts to propagation
distance. In the resulting space-times, the velocity dependence of Doppler
shifts is a function of propagation distance. If the group parameter and
Hubble's constant have the same order of magnitude, observed frequency shifts
in radiation received from stellar sources can imply source velocities quite
different from those implied in Minkowski space. In these space-times,
electromagnetic waves received from bodies in galactic Kepler orbits undergo
frequency shifts which are indistinguishable from shifts currently attributed
to dark matter and dark energy in Minkowski space, or to a non-Newtonian
physics.

the macro-behavior of a medium by its micro-properties. In mathematics,
homogenization theory considers the limitations of the sequences of the
problems and its solutions when a parameter tends to zero. This parameter is
regarded as the ratio of the characteristic size in the micro scale to that in
the macro scale. So what is considered is a sequence of problems in a fixed
domain while the characteristic size in micro scale tends to zero. But for the
real situations in physics or engineering, the micro scale of a medium is fixed
and can not be changed. In the process of homogenization, it is the size in
macro scale which becomes larger and larger and tends to infinity. We observe
that the homogenization in physics is not equivalent to the homogenization in
mathematics up to some simple rescaling. With some direct error estimates, we
explain in what means we can accept the homogenized problem as the limitation
of the original real physical problems. As a byproduct, we present some results
on the mathematical homogenization of some problems with source term being only
weakly compacted in $H^{-1}$, while in standard homogenization theory, the
source term is assumed to be at least compacted in $H^{-1}$. A real example is
also given to show the validation of our observation and results.

neutrality on quark pairing in the three-flavor Polyakov--Nambu--Jona-Lasinio

(2SC) or symmetric color-flavor-locked (CFL) pairing at low temperatures, we
find that in the absence of a local color neutrality constraint the inclusion
of the Polyakov loop gives rise to phases in which all quark colors and flavors
pair, but with unequal magnitudes. We study this asymmetric color-flavor-locked
(ACFL) phase, which can exist even for equal mass quarks, identifying its
location in the phase diagram, the order of the associated phase transitions,
and its symmetry breaking pattern, which proves to be the intersection of the
symmetry groups of the 2SC and CFL phases. We also investigate the effects of
the strange quark mass on this new phase and the QCD phase diagram generally.
Finally, we analyze the effect of a local color neutrality constraint on these
phases of asymmetric pairing. We observe that for massless quarks the
neutrality constraint renders the 2SC phase energetically unfavorable,
eliminating it at low temperatures, and giving rise to the previously proposed
low temperature critical point, with associated continuity between the hadronic
and ACFL phases. For realistic strange quark masses, however, the neutrality
constraint shrinks the 2SC region of the phase diagram, but does not eliminate
it, at T=0.

  This paper presents a benchmarking study of a selected list of representative
Portuguese research units, based on a fairly complete set of parameters:
bibliometric parameters, number of competitive projects and number of PhDs
produced. The study aimed at collecting productivity and impact data from the
selected research units in comparable conditions i.e., using objective metrics
based on public information, retrievable on-line and/or from official sources
and thus verifiable and repeatable. The study has thus focused on the activity
of the 2003-06 period, where such data was available from the latest official
evaluation.
  The main advantage of our study was the application of automatic tools,
achieving relevant results at a reduced cost. Moreover, the results over the
selected units suggest that this kind of analyses will be very useful to
benchmark scientific productivity and impact, and assist peer review.

eigenvectors of a Hermitian matrix or matrix pencil has many applications. A
new density-matrix-based algorithm has been proposed recently and a software
package FEAST has been developed. The density-matrix approach allows FEAST's
implementation to exploit a key strength of modern computer architectures,
namely, multiple levels of parallelism. Consequently, the software package has
been well received, especially in the electronic structure community.
Nevertheless, theoretical analysis of FEAST has lagged. For instance, the FEAST
algorithm has not been proven to converge. This paper offers a detailed
numerical analysis of FEAST. In particular, we show that the FEAST algorithm
can be understood as an accelerated subspace iteration algorithm in conjunction
with the Rayleigh-Ritz procedure. The novelty of FEAST lies in its accelerator
which is a rational matrix function that approximates the spectral projector
onto the eigenspace in question. Analysis of the numerical nature of this
approximate spectral projector and the resulting subspaces generated in the
FEAST algorithm establishes the algorithm's convergence. This paper shows that
FEAST is resilient against rounding errors and establishes properties that can
be leveraged to enhance the algorithm's robustness. Finally, we propose an
extension of FEAST to handle non-Hermitian problems and suggest some future
research directions.

much room for improvement. We propose a new blind deconvolution method using
incremental sparse edge approximation to recover images blurred by camera
shake. We estimate the blur kernel first from only the strongest edges in the
image, then gradually refine this estimate by allowing for weaker and weaker
edges. Our method competes with the benchmark deblurring performance of the
state-of-the-art while being significantly faster and easier to generalize.

transformation of some unknown parameters, and we wish to estimate these
unknowns from the data. Separable inverse problems are a powerful
generalization in which the transformation itself depends on additional unknown
parameters and we wish to determine both sets of parameters simultaneously.
When separable problems are solved by optimization, convergence can often be
accelerated by elimination of the linear variables, a strategy which appears
most prominently in the variable projection methods due to Golub, Pereyra, and
Kaufman. Existing variable elimination methods require an explicit formula for
the optimal value of the linear variables, so they cannot be used in problems
with Poisson likelihoods, bound constraints, or other important departures from
least squares.
  To address this limitation, we propose a generalization of variable
elimination in which standard optimization methods are modified to behave as
though a variable has been eliminated. We verify that this approach is a proper
generalization by using it to re-derive several existing variable elimination
techniques. We then extend the approach to bound-constrained and Poissonian
problems, showing in the process that many of the best features of variable
elimination methods can be duplicated in our framework. Tests on difficult
exponential sum fitting and blind deconvolution problems indicate that the
proposed approach can have significant speed and robustness advantages over
standard methods.

calculations show that the acceleration and the decrease of the equatorial
velocity can be reproduced by the evolution of the differential rotation
zero-age MS model with the angular momentum transport caused by hydrodynamic
instabilities during the MS stage. The acceleration results from the fact that
the angular momentum stored in the interiors of the stars is transported
outwards. In the last stage, the core and the radiative envelope are
uncoupling, and the rotation of the envelope is a quasi-solid rotation; the
uncoupling and the expansion of the envelope lead to that the decrease of the
equatorial velocity approximately follows the slope for the change in the
equatorial velocity of the model without any redistribution of angular
momentum. When the fractional age 0.3 $\lesssim\mathrm{t/t_{MS}}\lesssim$ 0.5,
the equatorial velocity remains almost constant for the stars whose central
density increases with age in the early stage of the MS phase, while the

a population to vary over time. Discriminating between these two evolutionary
forces, based on a time series of samples from a population, remains an
outstanding problem with increasing relevance to modern data sets. Even in the
idealized situation when the sampled locus is independent of all other loci
this problem is difficult to solve, especially when the size of the population
from which the samples are drawn is unknown. A standard $\chi^2$-based
likelihood ratio test was previously proposed to address this problem. Here we
show that the $\chi^2$ test of selection substantially underestimates the
probability of Type I error, leading to more false positives than indicated by
its $P$-value, especially at stringent $P$-values. We introduce two methods to
correct this bias. The empirical likelihood ratio test (ELRT) rejects
neutrality when the likelihood ratio statistic falls in the tail of the
empirical distribution obtained under the most likely neutral population size.
The frequency increment test (FIT) rejects neutrality if the distribution of
normalized allele frequency increments exhibits a mean that deviates
significantly from zero. We characterize the statistical power of these two
tests for selection, and we apply them to three experimental data sets. We
demonstrate that both ELRT and FIT have power to detect selection in practical
parameter regimes, such as those encountered in microbial evolution
experiments. Our analysis applies to a single diallelic locus, assumed
independent of all other loci, which is most relevant to full-genome selection
scans in sexual organisms, and also to evolution experiments in asexual
organisms as long as clonal interference is weak. Different techniques will be
required to detect selection in time series of co-segregating linked loci.

with the experimental discovery. This ratio is insensitive to the selected
parameters, manifesting its universality. Another lower-energy peak below
resonance energy is predicted when the hole pocket emerges due to suppression
of spin-density wave. We further verify that the ratio of linear scales is
intimately related to the pairing symmetry. Distinct ratio can be found with

many single neuron models that exhibit a strongly attracting limit cycle. The
framework for analysing such models in response to weak perturbations is now
particularly well advanced, and has allowed for the development of a theory of
weakly connected neural networks. However, the strong-attraction assumption may
well not be the natural one for many neural oscillator models. For example, the
popular conductance based Morris-Lecar model is known to respond to periodic
pulsatile stimulation in a chaotic fashion that cannot be adequately described
with a phase reduction. In this paper, we generalise the phase description that
allows one to track the evolution of distance from the cycle as well as phase
on cycle. We use a classical technique from the theory of ordinary differential
equations that makes use of a moving coordinate system to analyse periodic
orbits. The subsequent phase-amplitude description is shown to be very well
suited to understanding the response of the oscillator to external stimuli
(which are not necessarily weak). We consider a number of examples of neural
oscillator models, ranging from planar through to high dimensional models, to
illustrate the effectiveness of this approach in providing an improvement over
the standard phase-reduction technique. As an explicit application of this
phase-amplitude framework, we consider in some detail the response of a generic
planar model where the strong-attraction assumption does not hold, and examine
the response of the system to periodic pulsatile forcing. In addition, we
explore how the presence of dynamical shear can lead to a chaotic response.

agents belonging to two distinct communities which have markedly different

eigenvalues can be complex numbers, the information entropy may become also
complex-valued. It is calculated for the illustrating case. The role of the

10 T) of 4.4 x 103 A/cm2 (Ic =15.7 A) was obtained for a thin tape of 0.3 mm in
thickness, which is the highest value reported so far for the PIT processed 122
wires and tapes with a Ag sheath and processed by a conventional route. The
measurement by a hybrid magnet showed that Jc-H curve maintains very small
field dependence up to the strong magnetic field of 28 T as expected from the
previously reported high Hc2 value. The core of the thin tape shows dense grain
structure with less cracks and voids and indicates the development of c-axis
alignment, although it is still incomplete. The researches to elucidate the
origin of Jc enhancement and to have further improvement of transport Jc are
now ongoing. The process is simple using a Ag single sheath and, therefore,
more realistic technique for long length wire production.

outliers) that have missing correspondence and/or local large deformations, can
be more difficult than matching the common structures with small deformations

segmentation to remove the outlier effect in the registration. Moreover, these
works do not handle simultaneously the missing correspondences and local large
deformations. In this paper, we defined the nonrigid image registration as a
local adaptive kernel regression which locally reconstruct the moving image's
dense deformation vectors from the sparse deformation vectors in the
multi-resolution block matching. The kernel function of the kernel regression
adapts its shape and orientation to the reference image's structure to gather
more deformation vector samples of the same structure for the iterative
regression computation, whereby the moving image's local deformations could be
compliant with the reference image's local structures. To estimate the local
deformations around the outliers, we use joint saliency map that highlights the
corresponding saliency structures (called Joint Saliency Structures, JSSs) in
the two images to guide the dense deformation reconstruction by emphasizing
those JSSs' sparse deformation vectors in the kernel regression. The
experimental results demonstrate that by using local JSS adaptive kernel
regression, the proposed method achieves almost the best performance in
alignment of all challenging image pairs with outlier structures compared with
other five state-of-the-art nonrigid registration algorithms.

different kinetics. This gives rise to a spectral phonon distribution function
that deviates from local equilibrium along the substrate and is sensitive to

Equilibration of the heat flow out of the substrate to the Pt probe and

mediates the angular momentum transfer to/from the rotating NS magnetosphere by
large-scale convective motions, which lead to an almost iso-angular-momentum
rotation law inside the shell. The accretion rate through the shell is
determined by the ability of the plasma to enter the magnetosphere due to
Rayleigh-Taylor instability while taking cooling into account. The settling
regime of accretion is possible for moderate X-ray luminosities L <4 10^36
erg/s. At higher luminosities a free-fall gap above the NS magnetosphere
appears due to rapid Compton cooling, and accretion becomes highly
non-stationary. From observations of spin-up/spin-down rates of wind accreting
equilibrium XPSRs with known orbital periods (GX 301-2, Vela X-1), the main
dimensionless parameters of the model and be determined and the NS magnetic
field can be estimated. For equilibrium pulsars with independent measurements
of the magnetic field the velocity of the stellar wind can be estimated without
the use of complicated spectroscopic measurements. For non-equilibrium pulsars,
a maximum possible value of the spin-down rate of the accreting neutron star
exists. From observations of the spin-down rate and the X-ray luminosity in
such pulsars (e. g. GX 1+4, SXP 1062 and 4U 2206+54) a lower limit on the
neutron star magnetic field is obtained, which in all cases turns out to be
close to the standard 10^12-10^13 G value, in agreement with cyclotron line
measurements. The model explains both the spin-up/spin-down of the pulsar

$h\rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ and $h\rightarrow Z\gamma$ in the Type-II seesaw
neutrino model. In most of the allowed parameter space in the model, the new
contribution to $h\rightarrow Z\gamma$ is positively correlated with that to
$h\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$. If the current excess of the $h\rightarrow
\gamma\gamma$ rate measured by the ATLAS Collaboration persists, the
$h\rightarrow Z\gamma$ rate should be also larger than the corresponding
standard model prediction. We demonstrate that the anti-correlation between
$h\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$ and $h\rightarrow Z\gamma$ only exists in some
special region.

anti-retroviral therapy (ART) reduces their risk of TB but not to the level in
HIV negative people. Since HIV-positive people who are on ART can expect to
live a normal life for several decades this raises the possibility that their
elevated risk of infection, lasting for a long time, could lead to an increase
in the population level incidence of TB. Here we investigate the conditions
under which this could happen and show that provided HIV-positive people start
ART when their CD4+ cell count is greater than 350/microL and that there is
high coverage, ART will not lead to a long-term increase in HIV. Only if people
start ART very late and there is low coverage of ART might starting people on
ART increase the population level incidence of TB.

multi-scale process involving both ion and electron kinetic processes. Because
of their small mass, the electron scales are difficult to resolve in numerical
and satellite data, it is therefore critical to know whether the overall
evolution of the reconnection process is influenced by the kinetic nature of
the electrons, or is unchanged when assuming a simpler, fluid, electron model.
This paper investigate this issue in the general context of an asymmetric
current sheet, where both the magnetic field amplitude and the density vary
through the discontinuity. A comparison is made between fully kinetic and
hybrid kinetic simulations of magnetic reconnection in coplanar and guide field
systems. The models share the initial condition but differ in their electron
modeling. It is found that the overall evolution of the system, including the
reconnection rate, is very similar between both models. The best agreement is
found in the guide field system, which confines particle better than the
coplanar one, where the locality of the moments is violated by the electron
bounce motion. It is also shown that, contrary to the common understanding,
reconnection is much faster in the guide field system than in the coplanar one.
Both models show this tendency, indicating that the phenomenon is driven by ion
kinetic effects and not electron ones.

aim constrain binary processes such as the common envelope phase and the
efficiency of mass retention of white dwarf accretion. We find that the
simulated rates are not sufficient to explain the observed rates. Further, we
find that the mass retention efficiency of white dwarf accretion significantly
influences the rates, but does not explain all the differences between
simulated rates from different BPS codes.

  Mechanics by Linear Superposition","10 pages",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The quantum mechanics status of the probability vector current density has
long seemed to be marginal. On one hand no systematic prescription for its
construction is provided, and the special examples of it that are obtained for
particular types of Hamiltonian operator could conceivably be attributed to
happenstance. On the other hand this concept's key physical interpretation as
local average particle flux, which flows from the equation of continuity that
it is supposed to satisfy in conjunction with the probability scalar density,
has been claimed to breach the uncertainty principle. Given the dispiriting
impact of that claim, we straightaway point out that the subtle directional
nature of the uncertainty principle makes it consistent with the measurement of
local average particle flux. We next focus on the fact that the unique
closed-form linear-superposition quantization of any classical Hamiltonian
function yields in tandem the corresponding unique linear-superposition
closed-form divergence of the probability vector current density. Because the
probability vector current density is linked to the quantum physics only
through the occurrence of its divergence in the equation of continuity, it is
theoretically most appropriate to construct this vector field exclusively from
its divergence -- analysis of the best-known ""textbook"" special example of a
probability vector current density shows that it is thus constructed. That
special example in fact leads to the physically interesting ""Ehrenfest
subclass"" of probability vector current densities, which are closely related to
their classical peers.

envelopes of many evolved stars in various vibrationally-excited rotational
transitions. It is considered a good tracer of the wind dynamics close to the
photosphere of the star. We have investigated the polarization morphology in
the circumstellar envelope of an AGB star, R Cas. We mapped the linear and
circular polarization of SiO masers in the v=1, J=1-0 transition. The linear
polarization is typically a few tens of percent while the circular polarization
is a few percent. The fractional polarization tends to be higher for emission
of lower total intensity. We found that, in some isolated features the
fractional linear polarization appears to exceed 100%. We found the Faraday
rotation is not negligible but is ~15 deg., which could produce small scale
structure in polarized emission whilst total intensity is smoother and partly
resolved out. The polarization angles vary considerably from feature to feature
but there is a tendency to favour the directions parallel or perpendicular to
the radial direction with respect to the star. In some features, the
polarization angle abruptly flips 90 deg. We found that our data are in the
regime where the model of Goldreich et al (1973) can be applied and the
polarization angle flip is caused when the magnetic field is at close to 55
deg. to the line of sight. The polarization angle configuration is consistent
with a radial magnetic field although other configurations are not excluded.

well-known model for physical Brownian motion, modelling the behaviour of an
object subject to random impulses [L. S. Ornstein, G. E. Uhlenbeck: On the
theory of Brownian Motion. In: Physical Review. 36, 1930, 823-841]. One can
scale these models by changing the mass of the particle and in the small mass
limit one has almost sure uniform convergence in distribution to the standard
idealized model of mathematical Brownian motion. This provides one well known
way of realising the Wiener process. However, this result is less robust than
it would appear and important generic functionals of the trajectories of the
physical Brownian motion do not necessarily converge to the same functionals of
Brownian motion when one takes the small mass limit. In presence of a magnetic
field the area process associated to the physical process converges - but not
to L\'evy's stochastic area. As this area is felt generically in settings where
the particle interacts through force fields in a nonlinear way, the remark is
physically significant and indicates that classical Brownian motion, with its
usual stochastic calculus, is not an appropriate model for the limiting
behaviour.
  We compute explicitly the area correction term and establish convergence, in
the small mass limit, of the physical Brownian motion in the rough path sense.
The small mass limit for the motion of a charged particle in the presence of a
magnetic field is, in distribution, an easily calculable, but ""non-canonical""
rough path lift of Brownian motion. Viewing the trajectory of a charged
Brownian particle with small mass as a rough path is informative and allows one
to retain information that would be lost if one only considered it as a
classical trajectory. We comment on the importance of this point of view.

Nevertheless, the associated instantaneous Lyapunov instability, or ""sensitive

growing time-symmetry-breaking irreversibility. Surprisingly, the positive and
negative exponents, as well as the forward and backward Lyapunov spectra, are
usually not closely related, and so give four differing topological measures of
""local"" chaos. We have demonstrated this symmetry breaking for fluid
shockwaves, for free expansions, and for chaotic molecular collisions. Here we
illustrate and discuss this time-symmetry breaking for three

20\degr$; $|\,b\,| < 1.5\degr$. 94\,per\,cent of methanol masers in the region
are associated with sub-millimetre dust emission. We estimate masses for ~450
maser-associated sources and find that methanol masers are preferentially
associated with massive clumps. These clumps are centrally condensed, with
envelope structures that appear to be scale-free, the mean maser position being
offset from the peak column density by 0.0 \pm 4"". Assuming a Kroupa initial
mass function and a star-formation efficiency of ~30\,per\,cent, we find that
over two thirds of the clumps are likely to form clusters with masses
>20\,\msun. Furthermore, almost all clumps satisfy the empirical mass-size
criterion for massive star formation. Bolometric luminosities taken from the
literature for ~100 clumps range between ~100 and 10$^6$\,\lsun. This confirms
the link between methanol masers and massive young stars for 90\,per\,cent of
our sample. The Galactic distribution of sources suggests that the
star-formation efficiency is significantly reduced in the Galactic-centre
region, compared to the rest of the survey area, where it is broadly constant,
and shows a significant drop in the massive star-formation rate density in the
outer Galaxy. We find no enhancement in source counts towards the southern
Scutum-Centaurus arm tangent at $\ell ~ 315\degr$, which suggests that this arm
is not actively forming stars.

reals as its input. Each process can communicate directly with all the
processes in the system; thus the communication network is a complete graph.
All the communication channels are reliable and FIFO (first-in-first-out). The
problem of Byzantine vector consensus (BVC) requires agreement on a
d-dimensional vector that is in the convex hull of the d-dimensional input
vectors at the non-faulty processes. We obtain the following results for
Byzantine vector consensus in complete graphs while tolerating up to f
Byzantine failures:
  * We prove that in a synchronous system, n >= max(3f+1, (d+1)f+1) is
necessary and sufficient for achieving Byzantine vector consensus.
  * In an asynchronous system, it is known that exact consensus is impossible
in presence of faulty processes. For an asynchronous system, we prove that n >=
(d+2)f+1 is necessary and sufficient to achieve approximate Byzantine vector
consensus.
  Our sufficiency proofs are constructive. We show sufficiency by providing
explicit algorithms that solve exact BVC in synchronous systems, and
approximate BVC in asynchronous systems.
  We also obtain tight bounds on the number of processes for achieving BVC
using algorithms that are restricted to a simpler communication pattern.

may be used to conduct quality control and due diligence in project management.
First, a much-neglected issue in project management is identified, namely that
the front-end estimates of costs and benefits--used in the business cases,
cost-benefit analyses, and social and environmental impact assessments that
typically support decisions on projects--are typically significantly different
from actual ex post costs and benefits, and are therefore poor predictors of
the actual value and viability of projects. Second, it is discussed how
Kahneman and Tversky's theories of the planning fallacy and the outside view
may help explain and remedy this situation through quality control of
decisions. Third, it is described what quality control and due diligence are in
the context of project management, and an eight-step procedure is outlined for
due diligence based on the outside view. Fourth, the procedure is tested on a
real-life, multibillion-dollar project, organized as a public-private
partnership. Finally, Akerlof and Shiller's recent discussion in economics of
""firing the forecaster"" is discussed together with its relevance to project
management. In sum, the paper demonstrates the need, the theoretical basis, a
practical methodology, and a real-life example for how to de-bias project
management using quality control and due diligence based on the outside view.

cluster has been observed in $B$ and $V$ broadband filters at two epochs
separated by ~ 6 years using a wide-field imager mounted on the WFI@ESO2.2m
telescope. All CCD frames were reduced using the astrometric techniques
described in Anderson et al. (2006). The proper motion r.m.s. error for stars
brighter than $V$ ~ 15 mag is 2.0 mas/yr but it gradually increases up to ~4
mas/yr at $V$ ~20 mag. Using proper motion data, membership probabilities have
been derived for the stars in the region of the cluster. They indicate that
three Be and one Ap stars are member of the cluster. The reddening
$E(B-V)=0.22\pm0.05$ mag, a distance 2.5$\pm$0.5 kpc and an age of ~ 20 Myr are
derived using stars of $P_{\mu}>70%$. Mass function slope $x=1.60\pm0.10$ is
derived for the cluster and cluster was found to be dynamically relaxed.
Finally, we provide positions, calibrated $B$ and $V$ magnitudes, relative
proper motions and membership probabilities for the stars in the field of NGC

considers sparse nonnegative Tucker decomposition (NTD), which is to decompose
a given tensor into the product of a core tensor and several factor matrices
with sparsity and nonnegativity constraints. An alternating proximal gradient
method (APG) is applied to solve the problem. The algorithm is then modified to
sparse NTD with missing values. Per-iteration cost of the algorithm is
estimated scalable about the data size, and global convergence is established
under fairly loose conditions. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real

the Hamiltonian formulation via symplectic reduction from a canonical
Hamiltonian system. The reduced system is described by a non-canonical
symplectic form, which has previously been derived for a single, circular disk
using heavy differential-geometric machinery in an infinite-dimensional
setting. In contrast, our derivation makes use of the fact that the dynamics of
the fluid, and thus the point vortex dynamics, is determined from first
principles. Using this knowledge we can directly determine the dynamics on the
reduced, finite-dimensional phase space, using only classical mechanics.
Furthermore, our approach easily handles several bodies of arbitrary shapes.
From the Hamiltonian description we derive a Lagrangian formulation, which
enables the system for variational time integrators. We briefly describe how to
implement such a numerical scheme and simulate different configurations for
validation.

passive (red), star-forming (blue), and intermediate (green). The strongest

make up only ~20 per cent of the field in the mass range
10^{10.3}<M_{star}/M_\odot<10^{11.0} but are the dominant component of groups.
If we assume that the properties of the field are similar to those of the
`pre-accreted' population, the environment quenching efficiency (\epsilon_\rho)
is defined as the fraction of field galaxies required to be quenched in order
to match the observed red fraction inside groups. The efficiency obtained is
~0.4, similar to its value in intermediate-density environments locally. While
green (intermediate) galaxies represent ~20 per cent of the star-forming
population in both the group and field, at all stellar masses, the average sSFR
of the group population is lower by a factor of ~3. The green population does
not show strong H-delta absorption that is characteristic of starburst
galaxies. Finally, the high fraction of passive galaxies in groups, when
combined with satellite accretion models, require that most accreted galaxies
have been affected by their environment. Thus, any delay between accretion and
the onset of truncation of star formation (\tau) must be <2 Gyr, shorter than
the 3-7 Gyr required to fit data at z=0. The relatively small fraction of
intermediate galaxies requires that the actual quenching process occurs
quickly, with an exponential decay timescale of \tau_q<1 Gyr.

interaction patterns involving multiple individuals have non-trivial temporal
structure that cannot be deduced from a network presentation where only
interaction frequencies are taken into account. We apply a recently introduced
method, temporal motifs, to identify interaction patterns in a temporal network
where nodes have additional attributes such as gender and age. We then develop
a null model that allows identifying differences between various types of nodes
so that these differences are independent of the network based on interaction
frequencies. We find gender-related differences in communication patters, and
show the existence of temporal homophily, the tendency of similar individuals
to participate in interaction patterns beyond what would be expected on the
basis of the network structure alone. We also show that temporal patterns
differ between dense and sparse parts of the network. Because this result is
independent of edge weights, it can be considered as an extension of
Granovetter's hypothesis to temporal networks.

to be determined in terms of three systems of monic orthogonal polynomials. The
formal Schweber quantization criterion for an energy variable $x$, originally
expressed in terms of infinite continued fractions, can be recast in terms of a
meromorphic function $F(z) = a_0 + \sum_{k=1}^\infty {\cal M}_k/(z-\xi_k)$ in
the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$ with {\em real simple} poles $\xi_k$ and {\em

the spectrum of the Rabi model. One obtains at once that, on the real axis, (i)
$F(x)$ monotonically decreases from $+\infty$ to $-\infty$ between any two of
its subsequent poles $\xi_k$ and $\xi_{k+1}$, (ii) there is exactly one zero of
$F(x)$ for $x\in (\xi_k,\xi_{k+1})$, and (iii) the spectrum corresponding to
the zeros of $F(x)$ does not have any accumulation point. Additionally, one can
provide much simpler proof of that the spectrum in each parity eigenspace
${\cal B}_\pm$ is necessarily {\em nondegenerate}. Thereby the calculation of
spectra is greatly facilitated. Our results allow us to critically examine
recent claims regarding solvability and integrability of the Rabi model.

risk-neutral density (RND) directly from a cross-section of put option bid-ask
quotes. More precisely, we propose to view the RND recovery problem as an
inverse problem. We first show that it is possible to define restricted put and
call operators that admit a singular value decomposition (SVD), which we
compute explicitly. We subsequently show that this new framework allows us to
devise a simple and fast quadratic programming method to recover the smoothest
RND whose corresponding put prices lie inside the bid-ask quotes. This method
is termed the spectral recovery method (SRM). Interestingly, the SVD of the
restricted put and call operators sheds some new light on the RND recovery
problem. The SRM improves on other RND recovery methods in the sense that:
  - it is fast and simple to implement since it requires solution of a single
quadratic program, while being fully nonparametric; - it takes the bid ask
quotes as sole input and does not require any sort of calibration, smoothing or
preprocessing of the data; - it is robust to the paucity of price quotes; - it
returns the smoothest density giving rise to prices that lie inside the bid ask
quotes. The estimated RND is therefore as well-behaved as can be; - it returns
a closed form estimate of the RND on the interval [0,B] of the positive real
line, where B is a positive constant that can be chosen arbitrarily. We thus
obtain both the middle part of the RND together with its full left tail and
part of its right tail.
  We confront this method to both real and simulated data and observe that it
fares well in practice. The SRM is thus found to be a promising alternative to
other RND recovery methods.

Rather than
trying to estimate directly the probability distribution of a random sentence
of the language, we define a Markov chain on finite sets of sentences with many
finite recurrent communicating classes and define our language model as the
invariant probability measures of the chain on each recurrent communicating
class. This Markov chain, that we call a communication model, recombines at
each step randomly the set of sentences forming its current state, using some
grammar rules. When the grammar rules are fixed and known in advance instead of
being estimated on the fly, we can prove supplementary mathematical properties.
In particular, we can prove in this case that all states are recurrent states,
so that the chain defines a partition of its state space into finite recurrent
communicating classes. We show that our approach is a decisive departure from
Markov models at the sentence level and discuss its relationships with Context
Free Grammars. Although the toric grammars we use are closely related to
Context Free Grammars, the way we generate the language from the grammar is
qualitatively different. Our communication model has two purposes. On the one
hand, it is used to define indirectly the probability distribution of a random
sentence of the language. On the other hand it can serve as a (crude) model of
language transmission from one speaker to another speaker through the
communication of a (large) set of sentences.

  A recent work (Fraigniaud et al., OPODIS 2012) studied the role of

identifiers are not needed. In this article, we answer their original question.
More than that, we do so under all combinations of the following two critical
variations on the underlying model of distributed computing:
  ($B$): the size of the identifiers is bounded by a function of the size of
the input network; as opposed to ($\neg B$): the identifiers are unbounded.
  ($C$): the nodes run a computable algorithm; as opposed to ($\neg C$): the

  While it is easy to see that under ($\neg B, \neg C$) identifiers are not

depth of penetration of these fractures is small, and they are perpendicular to
the cavern wall. The distance between two parallel fractures becomes larger
when fractures penetrate deeper into the rock mass, as some fractures stop

boundaries formed by the opened fractures. As long as the depth of penetration

colloidal bead is a widely used technique when the geometry between the probe
and the sample must be controlled, particularly in force spectroscopy. But some
questions remain: how does a bead glued at the end of a cantilever influence
its mechanical response ? And more important for quantitative measurements, can
we still determine the stiffness of the AFM probe with traditional techniques?
In this article, the influence of a colloidal mass loading on the eigenmodes
shape and resonant frequency is investigated by measuring the thermal noise on
rectangular AFM microcantilevers with and without a bead attached at their
extremities. The experiments are performed with a home-made ultra-sensitive
AFM, based on differential interferometry. The focused beam from the
interferometer probes the cantilever at different positions and the spatial
shapes of the modes are determined up to the fifth resonance, without external
excitation. The results clearly demonstrate that the first eigenmode almost
doesn't change by mass loading. However the oscillation behavior of higher
resonances present a marked difference: with a particle glued at its extremity,
the nodes of the mode are displaced towards the free end of the cantilever.
These results are compared to an analytical model taking into account the mass
and the inertial moment of the load in an Euler-Bernoulli framework, where the
normalization of the eigenmodes is explicitly worked out in order to allow a
quantitative prediction of the thermal noise amplitude of each mode. A good
agreement between the experimental results and the analytical model is
demonstrated, allowing a clean calibration of the probe stiffness.

a wide range of formal systems. This logic includes a form of hypothetical
judgment that leads to dynamically changing sets of assumptions and that is key
to encoding side conditions and contexts that occur frequently in structural
operational semantics (SOS) style presentations. Specifications are often
useful in reasoning about the systems they describe. The Abella theorem prover
supports such reasoning by explicitly embedding the specification logic within
a rich reasoning logic; specifications are then reasoned about through this
embedding. However, realizing an induction principle in the face of dynamically
changing assumption sets is nontrivial and the original Abella system uses only
a subset of the HH specification logic for this reason. We develop a method
here for supporting inductive reasoning over all of HH. Our approach takes
advantage of a focusing property of HH to isolate the use of an assumption and
the ability to finitely characterize the structure of any such assumption in
the reasoning logic. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these ideas via
several specification and meta-theoretic reasoning examples that have been

the observed growing trends between decreases in neutron monitor (NM) count
rate and MC/ejecta speed and its associated rigidity. MCs are faster and have
higher associated rigidities than ejecta. Also the deceleration of ICMEs seems
to be a cause in producing FDs as can be inferred from the decreasing trend
between NM count rate and deceleration. This probably implies that the
interaction between the ICME traveling from the corona to the Earth and the
solar wind can play an important role to produce deeper FDs. Finally, we
conclude that ejecta without flux rope topology are the less effective in

that assigns a color $\pi(v)\in L(v)$ to each vertex $v\in V(G)$ so that at

$(k,d)^*$-choosable if it admits an $(L,d)^*$-coloring for every list
assignment $L$ with $|L(v)|\ge k$ for all $v\in V(G)$. In 2001, Lih et al.
\cite{LSWZ-01} proved that planar graphs without 4- and $l$-cycles are
$(3,1)^*$-choosable, where $l\in \{5,6,7\}$. Later, Dong and Xu \cite{DX-09}
proved that planar graphs without 4- and l-cycles are $(3,1)^*$-choosable,
where $l\in \{8,9\}$.
  There exist planar graphs containing 4-cycles that are not
$(3,1)^*$-choosable (Crown, Crown and Woodall, 1986 \cite{CCW-86}). This partly
explains the fact that in all above known sufficient conditions for the
$(3,1)^*$-choosability of planar graphs the 4-cycles are completely forbidden.
In this paper we allow 4-cycles nonadjacent to relatively short cycles. More
precisely, we prove that every planar graph without 4-cycles adjacent to 3- and
4-cycles is $(3,1)^*$-choosable. This is a common strengthening of all above

intrinsically correlated ellipticities. In our model, we investigate the
distortion of the ellipticity field if the galaxies experience an apparent
shift in their position by weak lensing deflection and compare this effect to
the shearing effect induced by tidal fields. Starting with a derivation of
intrinsic ellipticity spectra by employing a tidal torquing model generating
galactic angular momenta, we model the galaxy ellipticity by assuming that the
galactic disk forms perpendicularly to the host halo angular momentum direction
and derive intrinsic ellipticity E-mode and B-mode spectra from the angular
momentum statistics. The lensing effect on the ellipticity field is modeled by
employing the methodology developed in the framework of lensing of the cosmic
microwave background polarisation. For EUCLID, ellipticity correlations are
altered by lensing deflection on multipoles l>1000 by ~5% for the ellipticity
E-modes and by ~30% for the B-modes, while a shallower survey would exhibit
larger changes on larger angular scales. In addition to the convolving effect
of lensing on the ellipticity spectra we investigate the E/B-mode conversion,
and discuss the possibility of measuring correlations between different
multipoles which is evoked by the homogeneity breaking effect of the lensing
displacement. Our conclusion is that although shape correlations generated by
weak gravitational shear is dominant, the shifting effect due to lensing is
shaping the ellipticity spectra on small angular scales and causes a number of
interesting phenomena, which might be observable by future surveys.

manifests itself as a zero-bias conductance anomaly appearing at a finite

zero-bias anomalies do not hold any relation with topological

resolution across a range of galaxy masses, morphologies and merger histories.
The simulated sample compares well with observations of high redshift galaxies

the Galaxy Stellar Mass Function (GSMF) at low masses ($M_\star \lt 5 \times

of 500K, in log g from 1.5 to 5.0 in steps of 0.5 dex, and [Fe/H] from -4.0 to
+0.5 in steps of 0.5 and 1.0 dex. We find a tight scaling relation between the
vertical velocity and the surface entropy jump, which itself correlates with
the constant entropy value of the adiabatic convection zone. The range in
intensity contrast is enhanced at lower metallicity. The granule size
correlates closely with the pressure scale height sampled at the depth of
maximum velocity. We compare the <3D> models with widely applied 1D models, as
well as with theoretical 1D hydrostatic models generated with the same EOS and
opacity tables as the 3D models, in order to isolate the effects of using
self-consistent and hydrodynamic modeling of convection, rather than the
classical mixing length theory approach. For the first time, we are able to
quantify systematically over a broad range of stellar parameters the
uncertainties of 1D models arising from the simplified treatment of physics, in
particular convective energy transport. In agreement with previous findings, we
find that the differences can be significant, especially for metal-poor stars.

and are expected to dissipate on a timescale of a few Myr. The processes
responsible for the removal of the dust and gas will strongly modify the radial
distribution of the dust and consequently the SED. In particular, a young
planet will open a gap, resulting in an inner disk dominating the near-IR
emission and an outer disk emitting mostly in the far-IR. We analyze a full set
of data (including VLTI/Pionier, VLTI/Midi, and VLT/NaCo/Sam) to constrain the
structure of the transition disk around TCha. We used the Mcfost radiative
transfer code to simultaneously model the SED and the interferometric
observations. We find that the dust responsible for the emission in excess in
the near-IR must have a narrow temperature distribution with a maximum close to
the silicate sublimation temperature. This translates into a narrow inner dusty
disk (0.07-0.11 AU). We find that the outer disk starts at about 12 AU and is
partially resolved by the Pionier, Sam, and Midi instruments. We show that the
Sam closure phases, interpreted as the signature of a candidate companion, may
actually trace the asymmetry generated by forward scattering by dust grains in
the upper layers of the outer disk. These observations help constrain the
inclination and position angle of the outer disk. The presence of matter inside
the gap is difficult to assess with present-day observations. Our model
suggests the outer disk contaminates the interferometric signature of any
potential companion that could be responsible for the gap opening, and such a
companion still has to be unambiguously detected. We stress the difficulty to
observe point sources in bright massive disks, and the consequent need to
account for disk asymmetries (e.g. anisotropic scattering) in model-dependent
search for companions.

redshift 3.045. The QSO is a previously known, obscured AGN. The halo appears
extended along the direction of the slit and exhibits two faint patches
separated by 17 proper kpc in projection from the QSO. Comparison of the
2-dimensional spectrum with archival HST ACS images shows that these patches
coincide spatially with emission from a peculiar, dumbbell-shaped, faint
galaxy. The assumptions that the Lyman alpha emission patches are originating
in the galaxy and that the galaxy is physically related to the QSO are at
variance with photometric estimates of the galaxy redshift. We show, however,
that a population of very young stars at the redshift of the QSO may fit the
existing rest frame broad band UV photometry of the galaxy. If this scenario is
correct then the symmetry of the galaxy in continuum and Lyman alpha emission,
the extension of the QSO's Lyman alpha emission in its direction, and the
likely presence of a young stellar population in close proximity to a
(short-lived) AGN suggest that this may be an example of AGN feedback
triggering external star formation in high redshift galaxies.

which hereafter we will term the stellar halo, using HST ACS/WFC observations
of 19 fields from the GHOSTS survey. The observed fields probe the stellar halo
out to a projected distance of ~ 50 kpc from the galactic center. Each field
was observed in both F606W and F814W filters. The 50% completeness levels of
the color magnitude diagrams (CMDs) are typically at 2 mag below the tip of the
red giant branch (TRGB). Fields at distances closer than 15 kpc show evidence
of disk-dominated populations whereas fields at larger distances are mostly
populated by halo stars. The RGB of the M81's halo CMDs is well matched with
isochrones of ~ 10 Gyr and metallicities [Fe/H] ~ -1.2 dex, suggesting that the
dominant stellar population of M81's halo has a similar age and metallicity.
The halo of M81 is characterized by a color distribution of width ~ 0.4 mag and
an approximately constant median value of (F606W - F814W) ~ 1 mag measured
using stars within the magnitude range 23.7 < F814W < 25.5. When considering
only fields located at galactocentric radius R > 15 kpc, we detect no color
gradient in the stellar halo of M81. We place a limit of 0.03+/-0.11 mag
difference between the median color of RGB M81 halo stars at ~ 15 and at 50
kpc, corresponding to a metallicity difference of 0.08+/-0.35 dex over that
radial range for an assumed constant age of 10 Gyr. We compare these results
with model predictions for the colors of stellar halos formed purely via
accretion of satellite galaxies. When we analyze the cosmologically motivated
models in the same way as the HST data, we find that they predict no color
gradient for the stellar halos, in good agreement with the observations.

orbital migration. In radiative disks an additional component of the corotation
torque scaling with the entropy gradient across the horseshoe region can
counteract the general inward migration, Type I migration can then be directed
either inward or outward depending on the local disk properties. Thus, special
locations exist in the disk toward which planets migrate in a convergent way.
  Here we present N-body simulations of the convergent migration of systems of
low-mass (M=1-10 m_earth) planets. We show that planets do not actually
converge in convergence zones. Rather, they become trapped in chains of mean
motion resonances (MMRs). This causes the planets' eccentricities to increase
to high enough values to affect the structure of the horseshoe region and
weaken the positive corotation torque. The zero-torque equilibrium point of the
resonant chain of planets is determined by the sum of the attenuated corotation
torques and unattenuated differential Lindblad torques acting on each planet.
  The effective convergence zone is shifted inward. Systems with several
planets can experience stochastic migration as a whole due to continuous
perturbations from planets entering and leaving resonances.

runaway of a white dwarf that is part of a compact binary, but the details of
the progenitor systems are still unknown and much debated. One of the proposed
progenitor theories is the single-degenerate channel in which a white dwarf
accretes from a companion, grows in mass, reaches a critical mass limit, and is
then consumed after thermonuclear runaway sets in. However, there are major
disagreements about the theoretical delay time distribution and the
corresponding time-integrated supernova Ia rate from this channel. We
investigate whether the differences are due to the uncertainty in the common
envelope phase and the fraction of transferred mass that is retained by the
white dwarf. This so-called retention efficiency may have a strong influence on
the final amount and timing of supernovae Ia. Using the population synthesis
code SeBa, we simulated large numbers of binaries for various assumptions on
common envelopes and retention efficiencies. We compare the resulting supernova
Ia rates and delay time distributions with each other and with those from the
literature, including observational data. For the three assumed retention
efficiencies, the integrated rate varies by a factor 3-4 to even more than a
factor 100, so in extreme cases, the retention efficiency strongly suppresses
the single-degenerate channel. Our different assumptions for the common
envelope phase change the integrated rate by a factor 2-3. Although our results
do recover the trend in the theoretical predictions from different binary
population synthesis codes, they do not fully explain the large disagreement

connection between AGN activity and star formation over a range of radial
scales in the host galaxy. We use the extinction-corrected luminosity of the
[OIII] 5007 \AA\ line as a proxy of intrinsic AGN power and supermassive black
hole (SMBH) accretion rate. The star formation rates (SFRs) are taken from the
MPA-JHU value-added catalog and are measured through the 3$^{\prime\prime}$
SDSS aperture. We construct matched samples of galaxies covering a range in
redshifts. With increasing redshift, the projected aperture size encompasses
increasing amounts of the host galaxy. This allows us to trace the radial
distribution of star-formation as a function of AGN luminosity. We find that
the star formation becomes more centrally concentrated with increasing AGN
luminosity and Eddington ratio. This implies that such circumnuclear star
formation is associated with AGN activity, and that it increasingly dominates
over omnipresent disk star formation at higher AGN luminosities, placing
critical constraints on theoretical models that link host galaxy star formation
and SMBH fueling. We parametrize this relationship and find that the star
formation on radial scales $<$1.7 kpc, when including a constant disk
component, has a sub-linear dependence on SMBH accretion rate: $SFR \propto
\dot{M}^{0.36}$, suggesting that angular momentum transfer through the disk
limits accretion efficiency rather than the supply from stellar mass loss.

those which include intrinsic noise. Relaxing the restriction hypothesis also
allows us to introduce a 'self-dualization' procedure, which yields a new class
of theories that share many features of quantum theory, such as obeying
Tsirelson's bound for the maximally entangled state. We then characterize joint

distinct phases with Abelian topological order, in the presence of unitary or
anti-unitary global symmetries . A key step is the identification of an edge
sewing condition that is used to check if two putative phases are indeed
distinct. We illustrate this method for the case of $Z_2$ topological order
($Z_2$ spin liquids), in the presence of an internal Z$_2$ global symmetry. We
find 6 distinct phases. The well known quantum number fractionalization
patterns account for half of these states. Phases also differ due to the
addition of a symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase. Also, we allow for
the unconventional possibility that anyons are exchanged by the symmetry. This
leads to 2 additional phases with symmetry protected Majorana edge modes. Other
routes to realizing protected edge states in SET phases are identified.
Symmetry enriched Laughlin states and double semion theories are also
discussed. Two surprising lessons that emerge are: (i) gauging the global
symmetry of distinct SET phases always lead to different topological orders
with the same total quantum dimension, (ii) gauge theories with distinct
Dijkgraaf-Witten topological terms may have the same topological order.

nearest neighbor Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice, we investigate the
""even-odd"" effect occuring when this state is confined to infinitely long
cylinders of finite circumference. We pursue a dual analysis, where we map the
effective Z_2 gauge theory from the kagome lattice to a frustrated Ising model
on the dice lattice. Unexpectedly, we find that the latter theory, if
restricted to nearest neighbor interactions, is insufficient to capture this
effect. We provide an explanation of why further neighbor interactions are
needed via a high-temperature expansion of the effective Hamiltonian. We then
carry out projective symmetry group analysis to understand which second
neighbor interactions can be introduced while respecting the lattice
symmetries. Finally, we qualitatively compare our results to numerics by
computing the dimerization operator within our theory. Systems with odd
circumferences exhibit a non-vanishing dimerization that decays exponentially
with circumference.

in-depth discussion on the merits and caveats of the single-epoch (SE) virial

sample biases on the order of a factor of several are likely present in the SE

distribution of SE masses in finite luminosity bins can be narrower than the
nominal uncertainty of these mass estimates. I then discuss the latest

physics. Besides clustering in halos, the universal character of gravity
implies that self-gravitating compact DM configurations might be spread
throughout the universe. The astrophysical signature of these objects may be
used to probe fundamental particle physics, or even to provide an alternative
description of compact objects in active galactic nuclei. Here we discuss the
most promising dissection tool of these configurations: the inspiral of a
compact stellar-size object and consequent gravitational-wave emission. The
inward motion of this ""test probe"" encodes unique information about the nature
of the central, supermassive DM configuration. When the probe travels through
some compact DM profile we show that, within a Newtonian approximation, the
quasi-adiabatic evolution of the inspiral is mainly driven by DM accretion into
the small compact object and by dynamical friction, rather than by
gravitational-wave radiation-reaction. These effects circularize the orbits and
leave a peculiar imprint on the gravitational waves emitted at late time. When
accretion dominates, the frequency and the amplitude of the gravitational-wave
signal produced during the latest stages of the inspiral are nearly constant.
In the exterior region we study a relativistic model in which the inspiral is
driven by the emission of gravitational and scalar waves. Resonances in the
energy flux appear whenever the orbital frequency matches the mass of the DM
particle and they correspond to the excitation of the central object's
quasinormal frequencies. Unexpectedly, these resonances can lead to large
dephasing with respect to standard inspiral templates, to such an extent as to
prevent detection with matched filtering techniques. We discuss some
observational consequences of these effects for gravitational-wave detection.

z=1.43, and numerous systems for which detailed follow-up will be possible. The
source redshifts span 0.9<z<2.5 (median redshift of 1.9), and their optical
magnitudes are in the range 19.6<r<22.3. We present a brief source-by-source

the chemotactic behaviour of the bacteria, the individual-based model also
includes cell proliferation and death. Cells consume the extracellular nutrient
field (chemoattractant) which is modelled using a partial differential

the hybrid model are derived and the existence of travelling wave solutions for
these models is established. It is shown that cell proliferation is necessary
for the existence of non-transient (stationary) travelling waves in hybrid
models. Additionally, a numerical comparison between the wave speeds of the
continuum models and the hybrid models shows good agreement in the case of weak

error rates p close to the threshold, our algorithm needs a runtime complexity
which is increased by O(L^2) relative to MWPM in order to achieve a lower

the runtime complexity is necessary any longer. For p->0, the logical error
rate achieved by our algorithm is exponentially smaller (in L) than that of
MWPM, without requiring an increased runtime complexity. Our algorithm allows

deriving effective temperatures for each star from (a) the TiO bands, (b)
line-free continuum regions of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs), and
(c) the integrated fluxes. We show that the temperatures derived from fits to
the TiO bands are systematically {\it lower} than the other two methods by
several hundred Kelvin. The TiO fits also dramatically over-predict the flux in
the near-IR, and imply extinctions which are anomalously low compared to
neighbouring stars. In contrast, the SED temperatures provide good fits to the
fluxes at all wavelengths other than the TiO bands, are in agreement with the
temperatures from the flux integration method, and imply extinctions consistent
with nearby stars. After considering a number of ways to reconcile this
discrepancy, we conclude that 3-D effects (i.e.\ granulation) are the most
likely cause, as they affect the temperature structure in the upper layers
where the TiO lines form. The continuum, however, which forms at much deeper
layers, is apparently more robust to such effects. We therefore conclude that
RSG temperatures are much warmer than previously thought. We discuss the
implications of this result for stellar evolution and supernova progenitors,
and provide relations to determine the bolometric luminosities of RSGs from
single-band photometry.

is the rank-based approach of Kupferman and Vardi, which operates over a DAG

observation that the vertices of this DAG can be ranked in a certain way,
termed an odd ranking, iff all runs are rejecting. The second is the
slice-based approach of K\""ahler and Wilke. This approach tracks levels of
""split trees"" - run trees in which only essential information about the history
of each run is maintained. While the slice-based construction is conceptually
simple, the complementing automata it generates are exponentially larger than
those of the recent rank-based construction of Schewe, and it suffers from the
difficulty of symbolically encoding levels of split trees. In this work we
reformulate the slice-based approach in terms of run DAGs and preorders over
states. In doing so, we begin to draw parallels between the rank-based and
slice-based approaches. Through deeper analysis of the slice-based approach, we
strongly restrict the nondeterminism it generates. We are then able to employ
the slice-based approach to provide a new odd ranking, called a retrospective
ranking, that is different from the one provided by Kupferman and Vardi. This
new ranking allows us to construct a deterministic-in-the-limit rank-based
automaton with a highly restricted transition function. Further, by phrasing
the slice-based approach in terms of ranks, our approach affords a simple
symbolic encoding and achieves the tight bound of Schewe's construction

matrix through a Gaussian graphical model, where an edge is present only when
two vertices are within a given distance. For a proper choice of the order of
graph, we obtain the convergence rate of the posterior distribution and Bayes
estimators based on the graphical model in the $L_{\infty}$-operator norm
uniformly over a class of precision matrices, even if the true precision matrix
may not have a banded structure. Along the way to the proof, we also compute
the convergence rate of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) under the same
set of condition, which is of independent interest. The graphical model based
MLE and Bayes estimators are automatically positive definite, which is a
desirable property not possessed by some other estimators in the literature. We
also conduct a simulation study to compare finite sample performance of the
Bayes estimators and the MLE based on the graphical model with that obtained by
using a Cholesky decomposition of the precision matrix. Finally, we discuss a
practical method of choosing the order of the graphical model using the
marginal likelihood function.

the wedge. The latter behaves as a Brownian motion with constant drift vector

of the wedge after spending an instant of time there. In particular, this leads
to a natural multidimensional generalization of sticky Brownian motion on the
half-line, which is of interest in both queuing theory and stochastic portfolio

of 12CO and 13CO J = 1-0 line emission from the FCRAO 14m telescope are
analysed to assess the variation of the CO abundance with physical conditions
throughout the Orion A and Orion B molecular clouds. Three distinct Av regimes
are identified in which the ratio between the 13CO column density and visual
extinction changes corresponding to the photon dominated envelope, the strongly
self-shielded interior, and the cold, dense volumes of the clouds. Within the
strongly self-shielded interior of the Orion A cloud, the 13CO abundance varies
by 100% with a peak value located near regions of enhanced star formation
activity. The effect of CO depletion onto the ice mantles of dust grains is
limited to regions with AV > 10 mag and gas temperatures less than 20 K as
predicted by chemical models that consider thermal-evaporation to desorb
molecules from grain surfaces.
  Values of the molecular mass of each cloud are independently derived from the
distributions of Av and 13CO column densities with a constant 13CO-to-H2
abundance over various extinction ranges. Within the strongly self-shielded
interior of the cloud (Av > 3 mag), 13CO provides a reliable tracer of H2 mass
with the exception of the cold, dense volumes where depletion is important.
However, owing to its reduced abundance, 13CO does not trace the H2 mass that
resides in the extended cloud envelope, which comprises 40-50% of the molecular
mass of each cloud. The implied CO luminosity to mass ratios, M/L_{CO}, are 3.2
and 2.9 for Orion A and Orion B respectively, which are comparable to the value
(2.9), derived from gamma-ray observations of the Orion region. Our results
emphasize the need to consider local conditions when applying CO observations
to derive H2 column densities.

non-relativistic. Nonetheless, for certain types of fields satisfying certain
geometric properties, field lines can be defined covariantly. More precisely,
two Lorentz-invariant 2D surfaces in spacetime can be defined such that
magnetic and electric field lines are determined, for any observer, by the
intersection of those surfaces with spacelike hyperplanes. An instance of this
type of field is constituted by the so-called Hopf-Ranada solutions of the
source-free Maxwell equations, which have been studied because of their
interesting topological properties, namely, linkage of their field lines. In
order to describe both geometric and topological properties in a succinct
manner, we employ the tools of Geometric Algebra (aka Clifford Algebra) and use
the Clebsch representation for the vector potential as well as the Euler
representation for both magnetic and electric fields. This description is
easily made covariant, thus allowing us to define electric and magnetic field
lines covariantly in a compact geometric language. The definitions of field
lines can be phrased in terms of 2D surfaces in space. We display those
surfaces in different reference frames, showing how those surfaces change under
Lorentz transformations while keeping their topological properties. As a
byproduct we also obtain relations between optical helicity, optical chirality

learning method is fast and is based on simple linear algebraic operations,
e.g. singular value decomposition and tensor power iterations. We provide

matrices. The method, permuted rank-penalized least-squares (PRLS), is based on
a Kronecker product series expansion of the true covariance matrix. Assuming an
i.i.d. Gaussian random sample, we establish high dimensional rates of
convergence to the true covariance as both the number of samples and the number
of variables go to infinity. For covariance matrices of low separation rank,
our results establish that PRLS has significantly faster convergence than the
standard sample covariance matrix (SCM) estimator. The convergence rate
captures a fundamental tradeoff between estimation error and approximation
error, thus providing a scalable covariance estimation framework in terms of
separation rank, similar to low rank approximation of covariance matrices. The
MSE convergence rates generalize the high dimensional rates recently obtained
for the ML Flip-flop algorithm for Kronecker product covariance estimation. We
show that a class of block Toeplitz covariance matrices is approximatable by
low separation rank and give bounds on the minimal separation rank $r$ that
ensures a given level of bias. Simulations are presented to validate the
theoretical bounds. As a real world application, we illustrate the utility of
the proposed Kronecker covariance estimator for spatio-temporal linear least
squares prediction of multivariate wind speed measurements.

variation obtained from high throughput genome sequencing technologies is a
central challenge faced by human geneticists today. We hypothesize that the
variants involved in complex diseases are likely to exhibit non-neutral
evolutionary signatures. Uncovering the evolutionary history of all variants is
therefore of intrinsic interest for complex disease research. However, doing so
necessitates the simultaneous elucidation of the targets of natural selection
and population-specific demographic history. Here we characterize the action of
natural selection operating across complex disease categories, and use
population genetic simulations to evaluate the expected patterns of genetic
variation in large samples. We focus on populations that have experienced
historical bottlenecks followed by explosive growth (consistent with most human
populations), and describe the differences between evolutionarily deleterious
mutations and those that are neutral. Genes associated with several complex
disease categories exhibit stronger signatures of purifying selection than
non-disease genes. In addition, loci identified through genome-wide association
studies of complex traits also exhibit signatures consistent with being in
regions recurrently targeted by purifying selection. Through simulations, we
show that population bottlenecks and rapid growth enables deleterious rare
variants to persist at low frequencies just as long as neutral variants, but
low frequency and common variants tend to be much younger than neutral
variants. This has resulted in a large proportion of modern-day rare alleles
that have a deleterious effect on function, and that potentially contribute to
disease susceptibility.

total variation minimization step is never solved exactly. Instead, an accuracy
parameter is specified and the total variation minimization terminates once
this level of accuracy is reached. The choice of this parameter can vastly
impact both the computational time of the overall algorithm as well as the
accuracy of the result. Moreover, since the total variation minimization step
is not solved exactly, the algorithm is not guarantied to be monotonic. In the
present work we introduce a new adaptive stopping condition for the total
variation minimization that guarantees monotonicity. This results in an
algorithm that is actually monotonic in practice and is also significantly
faster than previous, non-adaptive algorithms.

random, so genetically identical cells can display different phenotypic

the decision-making process has focused on the role of intrinsic noise in these
systems. Yet, especially in the high copy-number regime, extrinsic noise has
been shown to be much more significant. Here, using a prototypical example of a
bistable self-regulating gene model, we develop a theoretical framework
describing the combined effect of intrinsic and extrinsic noise on the dynamics
of stochastic genetic switches. Employing our theory and Monte Carlo
simulations, we show that extrinsic noise not only significantly alters the
lifetimes of the phenotypic states, but can induce bistability in unexpected
regions of parameter space, and may fundamentally change the escape mechanism.
These results have implications for interpreting experimentally observed
heterogeneity in cellular populations and for stochastic modeling of cellular

effective composite is porous. Explicit formula for the energy bound is
obtained using the translation method enhanced with additional inequality
expressing certain property of stresses. Sufficient optimality conditions of
the energy bound are used to set the requirements which have to be met by the
stress fields in each phase of optimal effective material regardless of the
complexity of its microstructural geometry. We show that these requirements are
fulfilled in a special class of microgeometries, so-called laminates of a rank.
Their optimality is elaborated in detail for structures with significant amount

geometrical parameters of optimal multi-rank, high-porosity laminates are
different in various ranges of volume fractions and anisotropy level of

means of the sufficient conditions technique. Conjectures regarding
low-porosity regions are presented, but full treatment of this issue is

parameter and not as an observable: a state of a physical system is specified

the state can, and usually does, extend across all space, it is only defined at
one instant of time, in conflict with special relativity where space and time

the notion of the quantum density matrix for multiple spatial and temporal

for timelike separated measurements, motivating us to define a measure of
causality that discriminates between spacelike and timelike correlations.
Important properties of this measure, such as monotonicity under local

assume that the material being deformed is slightly compressible. It is shown
here that in shearing deformations the corresponding normal stress distribution
can exhibit extreme sensitivity to changes in Poisson's ratio. These changes
can even lead to a reversal of the usual Poynting effect. Therefore the usual
practice of arbitrarily choosing a value of Poisson's ratio when numerically
modelling rubbers and soft tissue will, almost certainly, lead to a significant
difference between the simulated and actual normal stresses in a sheared block
because of the difference between the assumed and actual value of Poisson's
ratio. The worrying conclusion is that simulations based on arbitrarily
specifying Poisson's ratio close to 1/2 cannot accurately predict the normal
stress distribution even for the simplest of shearing deformations. It is shown
analytically that this sensitivity is due to the small volume changes which
inevitably accompany all deformations of rubber-like materials. To minimise
these effects, great care should be exercised to accurately determine Poisson's
ratio before simulations begin.

deprivation of the geomagnetic field affected human cognitive processes as
estimated in several computer tests. The exposure to the hypomagnetic field
caused a statistically significant increase both in the task processing time
and in the number of errors. The magnitude of this magnetic effect, averaged
over 40 healthy subjects and more than 10^5 separate trials, was about 1.7%. In
the present work, the results of a simultaneous study are described, in which
the right eye of each subject was video recorded, while the subject performed
the tasks. It has appeared that the pupil size grows in the hypomagnetic field.
This effect has been calculated based on the treatment of a large data set of
about 6.10^6 video frames. Averaged all over the frames, the magnetic effect on
the pupil area was about 1.6%, with high statistical confidence. This is the
first laboratory study in which the number of separate trials has been large
enough to obtain rather smooth distribution functions. Thus, the small effect
of the hypomagnetic field on humans has become evident and statistically valid.

forming around dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way. For this purpose we use
collisionless N-body simulations of dwarfs initially composed of a disk
embedded in an NFW dark matter halo. The dwarfs are placed on seven orbits
around the Milky Way-like host, differing in size and eccentricity, and their
evolution is followed for 10 Gyr. In addition to the well-studied morphological
and dynamical transformation of the dwarf's main body, the tidal stripping
causes them to lose a substantial fraction of mass both in dark matter and
stars which form pronounced tidal tails. We focus on the properties of the
stellar component of the tidal tails thus formed. We first discuss the break
radii in the stellar density profile defining the transition to tidal tails as
the radii where the profile becomes shallower and relate them to the
classically defined tidal radii. We then calculate the relative density and
velocity of the tails at a few break radii as a function of the orbital phase.
Next, we measure the orientation of the tails with respect to an observer
placed at the centre of the Milky Way. The tails are perpendicular to this line
of sight only for a short period of time near the pericentre. For most of the
time the angles between the tails and this line of sight are low, with
orbit-averaged medians below 42 degrees for all, even the almost circular
orbit. The median angle is typically lower while the maximum relative density
higher for more eccentric orbits. The combined effects of relative density and
orientation of the tails suggest that they should be easiest to detect for
dwarf galaxies soon after their pericentre passage.

being agile, method selection and awareness of challenges and issues. These
fundamental factors encompass many items for agile movement and adoption

the set of initial configurations from which a given program always terminates.
First we define the dual set, of initial configurations from which a
non-terminating execution exists, as the greatest fixpoint of the function that
maps a set of states into its pre-image with respect to the transition
relation. This definition allows to compute the weakest non-termination
precondition if at least one of the following holds: (i) the transition
relation is deterministic, (ii) the descending Kleene sequence
overapproximating the greatest fixpoint converges in finitely many steps, or
(iii) the transition relation is well founded. We show that this is the case
for two classes of relations, namely octagonal and finite monoid affine
relations. Moreover, since the closed forms of these relations can be defined
in Presburger arithmetic, we obtain the decidability of the termination problem

star formation, it is crucial to establish the distribution, the extinction,
and the density of low-mass stars in massive star-forming regions. We analyze
deep X-ray observations of the Orion massive star-forming region using the
Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP) catalog. We studied the stellar
distribution as a function of extinction, with cells of 0.03 pc x 0.03 pc, the
typical size of protostellar cores. We derived stellar density maps and
calculated cluster stellar densities. We found that low-mass stars cluster
toward the three massive star-forming regions: the Trapezium Cluster (TC), the
Orion Hot Core (OHC), and OMC1-S. We derived low-mass stellar densities of
10^{5} stars pc^{-3} in the TC and OMC1-S, and of 10^{6} stars pc^{-3} in the
OHC. The close association between the low-mass star clusters with massive star
cradles supports the role of these clusters in the formation of massive stars.
The X-ray observations show for the first time in the TC that low-mass stars
with intermediate extinction are clustered toward the position of the most
massive star, which is surrounded by a ring of non-extincted low-mass stars.
This 'envelope-core' structure is also supported by infrared and optical
observations. Our analysis suggests that at least two basic ingredients are
needed in massive star formation: the presence of dense gas and a cluster of
low-mass stars. The scenario that better explains our findings assumes high
fragmentation in the parental core, accretion at subcore scales that forms a
low-mass stellar cluster, and subsequent competitive accretion. Finally,
although coalescence does not seem a common mechanism for building up massive
stars, we show that a single stellar merger may have occurred in the evolution
of the OHC cluster, favored by the presence of disks, binaries, and gas
accretion.

growth for this configuration. The spatial extent and localisation of the

background is found to contain a substantial amount of passive FIDA emission
driven by edge neutrals, and to depend delicately on viewing geometry. Results
are compared with theoretical expectations based on the codes NUBEAM (for fast
ion distributions) and FIDASIM. Calibrating via the measured beam emission
peaks, the toroidal FIDA signal profile agrees with classical simulations in
MHD quiescent discharges where the neutron rate is also classical. Long-lived
modes (LLM) and chirping modes decrease the core FIDA signal significantly, and
the profile can be matched closely to simulations using anomalous diffusive
transport; a spatially uniform diffusion coefficient is sufficient for chirping
modes, while a core localized diffusion is better for a LLM. Analysis of a
discharge with chirping mode activity shows a dramatic drop in the core FIDA
signal and rapid increase in the edge passive signal at the onset of the burst
indicating a very rapid redistribution towards the edge. Vertical viewing
measurements show a discrepancy with simulations at higher Doppler shifts when
the neutron rate is classical, which, combined with the fact that the toroidal
signals agree, means that the difference must be occurring for pitch angles
near the trapped-passing boundary. Further evidence of an anomalous transport
mechanism for these particles is provided by the fact that an increase of beam

inclusion shape and material are chosen so that the particles extract the
maximum possible power from given incident fields. It appears that for
different excitation scenarios the optimal particles are bianisotropic chiral,
omega, moving, and Tellegen particles. The optimal dimensions of the resonance
canonical chiral and omega particles are found analytically. Such optimal
particles have extreme properties in scattering (for example, zero
backscattering or invisibility). Planar arrays of optimal particles possess
extreme properties in reflection and transmission (e.g., total absorption or
magnetic-wall resonance), and volumetric composites of optimal particles
realize, for example, such extreme materials as the chiral nihility medium.

all linear methods for PDE solving that use the same input data. This is done
by writing them as linear recovery formulas for solution values as linear
combinations of the input data. Calculating the norm of these reproduction
formulas on a fixed Sobolev space will then serve as a quality criterion that
allows a fair comparison of all linear methods with the same inputs, including
finite-element, finite-difference and meshless local Petrov-Galerkin
techniques. A number of illustrative examples will be provided. As a byproduct,
it turns out that a unique error--optimal method exists. It necessarily
outperforms any other competing technique using the same data, e.g. those just
mentioned, and it is necessarily meshless, if solutions are written ""entirely
in terms of nodes"" (Belytschko et. al. 1996). On closer inspection, it turns
out that it coincides with {\em symmetric meshless collocation} carried out
with the kernel of the Hilbert space used for error evaluation, e.g. with the
kernel of the Sobolev space used. This technique is around since at least 1998,
but its optimality properties went unnoticed, so far.

also consistent with normal SNeIa at the spectroscopically determined redshift
of z=1.3883; however, the observed flux is a constant factor of ~30 times too
bright in each band over time as compared to the templates. At minimum, this
shows that the peak luminosities inferred from the light-curve widths of some
SNeIa will deviate significantly from the established, empirical relation used
by cosmologists. We argue on physical grounds that the observed fluxes do not
reflect an intrinsically luminous SNIa, but rather PS1-10afx is a normal SNIa
whose flux has been magnified by an external source. The only known
astrophysical source capable of such magnification is a gravitational lens.
Given the lack of obvious lens candidates, such as galaxy clusters, in the
vicinity, we further argue that the lens is a supermassive black hole or a
comparatively low-mass dark matter halo. In this case, the lens continues to
magnify the underlying host galaxy light. If confirmed, this discovery could
impact a broad range of topics including cosmology, gamma-ray bursts, and dark

we place one agent in each vertex of $G$. Every pair of agents sharing a common

sharing a common edge become acquainted, and the process continues. We define
the \emph{acquaintance time} of a graph $G$, denoted by $AC(G)$, to be the
minimal number of rounds required until every two agents are acquainted.
  We first study the acquaintance time for some natural families of graphs
including the path, expanders, the binary tree, and the complete bipartite

there exists an $n$-vertex graph $G$ such that $AC(G) =\Theta(k)$. We also
prove that for all $n$-vertex connected graphs $G$ we have $AC(G) =

upper bound achieved by sequentially letting each agent perform depth-first

network crosslinking is required to allow motors to induce macroscopic
contraction. Yet a quantitative understanding of how network connectivity
enables contraction is lacking. Here we show experimentally that myosin motors
contract crosslinked actin polymer networks to clusters with a scale-free size
distribution. This critical behavior occurs over an unexpectedly broad range of
crosslink concentrations. To understand this robustness, we develop a
quantitative model of contractile networks that takes into account network
restructuring: motors reduce connectivity by forcing crosslinks to unbind.
Paradoxically, to coordinate global contractions, motor activity should be low.
Otherwise, motors drive initially well-connected networks to a critical state

involving the eigenvalues of the radial quantum number, are neatly decomposed
into boundary-free, single-boundary-induced, and second-boundary-induced parts,
with the help of the generalized Abel-Plana summation formula. In this way, the
renormalization procedure is very conveniently reduced to the one corresponding
to boundary-free AdS spacetime. The boundary-induced contributions to the
fermionic condensate and to the vacuum expectation value of the energy density
are proven to be everywhere negative. The vacuum expectation values are
exponentially suppressed at distances from the boundaries much larger than the
curvature radius of the AdS space. Near the boundaries, effects related with
the curvature of the background spacetime are shown to be subdominant and, to
leading order, all known results for boundaries in the Minkowski bulk are
recovered. Zeta function techniques are successfully used for the evaluation of
the total vacuum energy in the region between the boundaries. It is proven that
the resulting interaction forces between them are attractive and that, for
large separations, they also decay exponentially. Finally, our results are

returns a word on which they differ. We also give an NC procedure for deciding
whether a given automaton is minimal, as well as a randomised NC procedure that
minimises an automaton. We consider probabilistic automata with rewards,
similar to Markov Decision Processes. For these automata we consider two
notions of equivalence: expectation equivalence and distribution equivalence.
The former requires that two automata have the same expected reward on each
input word, while the latter requires that each input word induce the same
distribution on rewards in each automaton. For both notions we give algorithms
for deciding equivalence by reduction to equivalence of Q-weighted automata.
Finally we show that the equivalence problem for Q-weighted visibly pushdown

control which operate in a distributed fashion, and yet achieve the optimal
throughput performance of centralized scheduling algorithms. However,
fundamental performance bounds reveal that the ""cautious"" activation rules
involved in establishing throughput optimality tend to produce extremely large
delays, typically growing exponentially in 1/(1-r), with r the load of the
system, in contrast to the usual linear growth.
  Motivated by that issue, we explore to what extent more ""aggressive"" schemes
can improve the delay performance. Our main finding is that aggressive
activation rules induce a lingering effect, where individual nodes retain
possession of a shared resource for excessive lengths of time even while a
majority of other nodes idle. Using central limit theorem type arguments, we
prove that the idleness induced by the lingering effect may cause the delays to
grow with 1/(1-r) at a quadratic rate. To the best of our knowledge, these are
the first mathematical results illuminating the lingering effect and
quantifying the performance impact.

allows us to work at the best angular resolution available now for an
extragalactic source. We observe a remarkably good correlation between SPIRE
and LABOCA emission and resolve the low surface brightnesses emission. We use
the Spitzer and Herschel data to perform a resolved Spectral Energy
Distribution (SED) modelling of the complex. Using MBB, we derive a global
emissivity index beta_c of 1.47. If beta cold is fixed to 1.5, we find an
average temperature of 27K. We also apply the Galliano et al. (2011) modelling
technique (and amorphous carbon to model carbon dust) to derive maps of the
star formation rate, the mean starlight intensity, the fraction of PAHs or the
dust mass surface density of the region. We observe that the PAH fraction
strongly decreases in the HII regions. This decrease coincides with peaks in
the mean radiation field intensity map. The dust surface densities follow the
FIR distribution, with a total dust mass of 2.1x10^4 Msolar (2.8 times less
than when using graphite grains) in the resolved elements we model. We find a
non-negligible amount of dust in the molecular cloud N159 South (showing no
massive SF). We also investigate the drivers of the Herschel/PACS and SPIRE
submm colours as well as the variations in the gas-to-dust mass ratio (G/D) and
the XCO conversion factor in the region N159. We finally model individual
regions to analyse variations in the SED shape across the complex and the 870um
emission in more details. No measurable submm excess emission at 870um seems to
be detected in these regions.

Boolean logic formula are notoriously hard. In many cases, even getting an
approximate count is difficult. Here we propose that entanglement, a common
concept in quantum information theory, may serve as a telltale of the
difficulty of counting exactly or approximately. We quantify entanglement by
using Renyi entropies S(q), which we define by bipartitioning the logic
variables of a generic satisfiability problem. We conjecture that
S(q\rightarrow 0) provides information about the difficulty of counting
solutions exactly, while S(q>0) indicates the possibility of doing an efficient
approximate counting. We test this conjecture by employing a matrix computing
scheme to numerically solve #2SAT problems for a large number of uniformly
distributed instances. We find that all Renyi entropies scale linearly with the
number of variables in the case of the #2SAT problem; this is consistent with
the fact that neither exact nor approximate efficient algorithms are known for
this problem. However, for the negated (disjunctive) form of the problem,
S(q\rightarrow 0) scales linearly while S(q>0) tends to zero when the number of
variables is large. These results are consistent with the existence of fully
polynomial-time randomized approximate algorithms for counting solutions of
disjunctive normal forms and suggests that efficient algorithms for the
conjunctive normal form may not exist.

Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE). The metallicities of the RR Lyraes,
determined from the periods and amplitudes of their light curves, reveal a
statistically significant radial abundance gradient that is approximately
one-half of what is seen in the disks of the Milky Way and M33. The RR Lyrae
abundance gradient agrees with that of the old and metal-poor LMC globular
clusters. The reddenings of the OGLE RR Lyraes have been calculated using their
minimum light colors and reveal a mean value of E(V-I) = 0.12 +/- 0.05, where
the quoted uncertainty represents the standard deviation of the mean. The
distribution of RR Lyrae extinctions across the face of the LMC is
well-correlated with the distribution and emission intensity of CO clouds based
on recent millimeter wave surveys. In addition, we find that the old LMC
globulars tend to be located in regions of low extinction. This underscores the
need to survey the higher extinction regions with the specific aim of
increasing the sample of old LMC globular clusters. Finally, we examine the
distance distribution of the RR Lyraes in order to probe the structure of the
LMC and investigate the possibility that some of the RR Lyraes may reside in a
kinematically hot halo population. In addition to calculating a mean LMC
distance of (m-M)o = 18.55 +/- 0.10 mag, we conclude that some fraction of the
RR Lyraes in our sample could be members of the LMC halo.

called hyperedges of rank $r\geq 2$, are excellent models to study systems with
interactions that are beyond the pairwise level. For hypergraphs, the node
degree $\ell$ (number of hyperedges connected to a node) and the number of
neighbors $k$ of a node differ from each other in contrast to the case of
graphs. Here, I calculate the distribution of the number of node neighbors in
random hypergraphs in which hyperedges of uniform rank $r$ have a homogeneous
probability $p$ to appear. This distribution is equivalent to the degree
distribution of ensembles of projected graphs from hypergraph or bipartite
network ensembles, where the projection connects any two nodes in the projected
graph when they are also connected in the hypergraph or bipartite network. The
calculation is non-trivial due to the possibility that neighbor nodes belong
simultaneously to multiple hyperedges (node overlaps). From the exact results,
the traditional sparse (small $p$) asymptotic approximation to the distribution
is rederived and improved; the approximation exhibits Poisson-like behavior
accompanied by strong fluctuations modulated by power-law decays in the system
size $N$ with decay exponents equal to the minimum number of overlapping nodes
possible for a given number of neighbors. It is shown that the dense limit
cannot be explained if overlaps are ignored, and the correct asymptotic
distribution is provided. The neighbor distribution requires the calculation of
a new combinatorial coefficient $Q_{r-1}(k,\ell)$, counting the number of
distinct labelled hypergraphs of $k$ nodes, $\ell$ hyperedges of rank $r-1$,
and where every node is connected to at least one hyperedge. Some identities of
$Q_{r-1}(k,\ell)$ are derived and applied to the verification of normalization
and the calculation of moments of the neighbor distribution.

hybrid curvature form (HCF) is introduced as a covariant derivative of DC. A
system of covariant Euler-Lagrange (EL) equations for DSV, DC, and a twin

Lagrangian form is composed based on a set of principles suited for UFT,
including the homogeneity in the UM space, differential irreducibility and
scale invariance. The type of the manifold geometry is not specified in
advance, in neither local (signature) nor regional (topology) aspects.

responsible for the non-linear features of the system i.e. interactions. In

same quantum state, say k=0 in some reference frame Sigma, is the essential
ingredient of the degenerate vacuum of present-day elementary particle physics.
This represents a sort of `quantum ether' which characterizes the physically
realized form of relativity and could play the role of preferred reference
frame in a modern re-formulation of the Lorentzian approach. In spite of this,
the so called `null results' of the classical ether-drift experiments,
traditionally interpreted as confirmations of Special Relativity, have so
deeply influenced scientific thought as to prevent a critical discussion on the
real reasons underlying its alleged supremacy. In this paper, we argue that
this traditional null interpretation is far from obvious. In fact, by using
Lorentz transformations to connect the Earth's frame to Sigma, the small
observed effects point to an average Earth's velocity of about 300 km/s, as in
most cosmic motions. A common feature is the irregular behaviour of the data.
While this has motivated, so far, their standard interpretation as instrumental
artifacts, our new re-analysis of the very accurate Joos experiment gives clear
indications for the type of Earth's motion associated with the CMB anisotropy
and leaves little space for this traditional interpretation. The new
explanation requires instead a view of the vacuum as a stochastic medium,
similar to a fluid in a turbulent state of motion, in agreement with basic
foundational aspects of both quantum physics and relativity. The overall
consistency of this picture with the present experiments with vacuum optical
resonators and the need for a new generation of dedicated ether-drift
experiments are also emphasized.

use the change in the received signal strength (RSS) of the links due to the
movements of people to infer their locations. In this paper, we consider
real-time multiple target tracking with RF sensor networks. We perform radio
tomographic imaging (RTI), which generates images of the change in the
propagation field, as if they were frames of a video. Our RTI method uses RSS
measurements on multiple frequency channels on each link, combining them with a
fade level-based weighted average. We describe methods to adapt machine vision
methods to the peculiarities of RTI to enable real time multiple target
tracking. Several tests are performed in an open environment, a one-bedroom
apartment, and a cluttered office environment. The results demonstrate that the
system is capable of accurately tracking in real-time up to 4 targets in
cluttered indoor environments, even when their trajectories intersect multiple
times, without mis-estimating the number of targets found in the monitored
area. The highest average tracking error measured in the tests is 0.45 m with
two targets, 0.46 m with three targets, and 0.55 m with four targets.

quantity, for machines made up of large amounts of parallel computing units,
each with its own local memory, the allocatable quantity is a single computing
unit. Where virtual address management is used to keep memory coherent and
allow allocation of more than physical memory is actually available, virtual
communication channel references can be used to make computing units stay
connected across allocation and swapping.

  published at the AAMAS 2013 conference",,,,"cs.GT q-fin.TR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we introduce a novel, non-recursive, maximal matching
algorithm for double auctions, which aims to maximize the amount of commodities
to be traded. It differs from the usual equilibrium matching, which clears a
market at the equilibrium price. We compare the two algorithms through
experimental analyses, showing that the maximal matching algorithm is favored
in scenarios where trading volume is a priority and that it may possibly
improve allocative efficiency over equilibrium matching as well. A
parameterized algorithm that incorporates both maximal matching and equilibrium
matching as special cases is also presented to allow flexible control on how
much to trade in a double auction.

microcavity-type structure with two intra-cavity metallic layers which could
serve as contacts for electrical pumping. The design of optical modes based on
utilizing peculiarities of Tamm plasmon provides vanishing absorption due to

the subjectiveness of its definition and the difficulty in devising
generalizable quantitative metrics. In this paper we address this challenge by
measuring the visual complexity of two common forms of cluster-based
visualizations: scatter plots and parallel coordinatess. We conceptualize
visual complexity as a form of visual uncertainty, which is a measure of the
degree of difficulty for humans to interpret a visual representation correctly.
We propose an algorithm for estimating visual complexity for the aforementioned
visualizations using Allen's interval algebra. We first establish a set of
primitive 2-cluster cases in scatter plots and another set for parallel
coordinatess based on symmetric isomorphism. We confirm that both are the
minimal sets and verify the correctness of their members computationally. We
score the uncertainty of each primitive case based on its topological
properties, including the existence of overlapping regions, splitting regions
and meeting points or edges. We compare a few optional scoring schemes against
a set of subjective scores by humans, and identify the one that is the most
consistent with the subjective scores. Finally, we extend the 2-cluster measure
to k-cluster measure as a general purpose estimator of visual complexity for
these two forms of cluster-based visualization.

special focus on the XYZ spin-1/2 chain, which, in addition to being
integrable, is also an interacting theory with non perturbative solutions. We
derive its bipartite Renyi entropies in the thermodynamic limit and its

analysed, both analytically and numerically. In particular it is worth

interactions in the final Hamiltonian, then the dynamics of the model at long

of radially oscillating bubbles in a sound field. The problem is classical in
the case of small-amplitude oscillations, for which an analytical expression of
the force can be easily obtained, and predicts attraction of sub- resonant
bubbles by pressure antinodes. But for high-amplitude sound fields, the bubbles
undergo large amplitude nonlinear oscillations, so that no analytical
expression of the force is available in this case. The bubble dynamics is
approximated on physical grounds, following the method of Hilgenfeldt et al.
[J. Fluid Mech., 365, 171 (1998)], but carefully accounting for surface
tension. The analytical expression of the maximum radius of the bubble is
recovered, the time of maximum expansion is noticeably refined, and an
estimation of the collapse-time is found. An analytical expression for the
time-varying bubble volume is deduced, and the Bjerknes force is obtained in
closed form. The result is valid for any shape of the sound field, including
purely standing or purely traveling waves, and is ready to use in a theoretical
model of bubble clouds evolution. Besides, the well-known sign inversion of the
Bjerknes force for large standing waves is recovered and the inversion
threshold in the parameter space is obtained analytically. The results are in
good agreement with numerical simulation and allow a quantitative assessment of
the physical parameters effect. It is found that either reducing surface
tension, or increasing the static pressure, should produce a widening of the
bubble-free region near high-amplitude pressure antinodes.

large-scale instability of a horizontal magnetic field if its strength is in a
suitable range (within a few percent of the turbulent equipartition value).
This instability is related to a suppression of the turbulent pressure so that
the turbulence contribution to the mean magnetic pressure becomes negative.
This results in the excitation of a negative effective magnetic pressure
instability (NEMPI). This instability has so far only been studied for an
imposed magnetic field. We want to know how NEMPI works when the mean magnetic
field is generated self-consistently by an $\alpha^2$ dynamo, whether it is
affected by global spherical geometry, and whether it can influence the
properties of the dynamo itself. We adopt the mean-field approach which has
previously been shown to provide a realistic description of NEMPI in direct
numerical simulations. We assume axisymmetry and solve the mean-field equations
with the Pencil-Code for an adiabatic stratification at a total density
contrast in the radial direction of approximately 4 orders of magnitude. NEMPI
is found to work when the dynamo-generated field is about 4% of the
equipartition value, which is achieved through strong $\alpha$ quenching. This
instability is excited in the top 5% of the outer radius provided the density
contrast across this top layer is at least 10. NEMPI is found to occur at lower
latitudes when the mean magnetic field is stronger. For weaker fields, NEMPI
can make the dynamo oscillatory with poleward migration. NEMPI is a viable

in which the quantum Fourier transform is replaced by a banded version that for
each qubit retains only coupling to its $b$ nearest neighbors. Defining the
performance $P(n,b)$ of the $n$-qubit algorithm for bandwidth $b$ as the ratio
of the success rates of Shor's algorithm equipped with the banded and the full
bandwidth ($b=n-1$) versions of the quantum Fourier transform, our numerical
simulations show that $P(n,b) \approx \exp[-\varphi_{max}^2 (n,b)/100]$ for $n
< n_t(b)$ (non-exponential regime) and $P(n,b) \approx 2^{-\xi_b (n-8)}$ for
$n>n_t(b)$ (exponential regime), where $n_{t}(b)$, the location of the
transition, is approximately given by $n_{t}(b)\approx b+5.9 +
\sqrt{7.7(b+2)-47}$ for $b\gtrsim 8$, $\varphi_{max} (n,b) = 2\pi[2^{-b-1}
(n-b-2) + 2^{-n}]$, and $\xi_b\approx 1.1 \times 2^{-2b}$. Analytically we
obtain $P(n,b) \approx \exp[-\varphi_{max}^2 (n,b)/64]$ for $n<n_t(b)$ and
$P(n,b) \approx 2^{-\xi_b^{(a)} n}$ for $n>n_t(b)$, where $\xi_{b}^{(a)}
\approx \frac{\pi^2}{12 \ln(2)} \times 2^{-2b} \approx 1.19 \times 2^{-2b}$.
Thus, our analytical results predict the $\varphi_{max}^2$ scaling ($n<n_t$)
and the $2^{-2b}$ scaling ($n>n_t$) of the data perfectly. In addition, in the
large-$n$ regime, the prefactor in $\xi_b^{(a)}$ is close to the results of our
numerical simulations and, in the low-$n$ regime, the numerical scaling factor
in our analytical result is within a factor 2 of its numerical value. As an
example we show that $b=8$ is sufficient for factoring RSA-2048 with a 95%
success rate.

randomly generate offsprings. These processes, more patently Galton-Watson
processes, are widely used to model biological, social, cognitive, and
technological phenomena, such as the diffusion of ideas, knowledge, chain
letters, viruses, and the evolution of humans through their Y-chromosome DNA or
mitochondrial RNA. A practical challenge of modeling real phenomena using a
Galton-Watson process is the offspring distribution, which must be measured
from the population. In most cases, however, directly measuring the offspring
distribution is unrealistic due to lack of resources or the death of agents. So
far, researchers have relied on informed guesses to guide their choice of
offspring distribution. In this work we propose two methods to estimate the
offspring distribution from real sampled data. Using a small sampled fraction
of the agents and instrumented with the identity of the ancestors of the
sampled agents, we show that accurate offspring distribution estimates can be
obtained by sampling as little as 14% of the population.

deformable porous solid. We present a mathematical model using the framework
offered by the theory of interacting continua. In its most general form, this
framework provides a mechanism for capturing multiphase flow, deformation,
chemical reactions and thermal processes, as well as interactions between the
various physics in a conveniently implemented fashion. To simplify the
presentation of the framework, results are presented for a particular model
than can be seen as an extension of Darcy's equation (which assumes that the
porous solid is rigid) that takes into account elastic deformation of the
porous solid. The model also considers the effect of deformation on porosity.
We show that using this model one can recover identical results as in the
framework proposed by Biot and Terzaghi. Some salient features of the framework
are as follows: (a) It is a consistent mixture theory model, and adheres to the
laws and principles of continuum thermodynamics, (b) the model is capable of
simulating various important phenomena like consolidation and surface
subsidence, and (c) the model is amenable to several extensions. We also
present numerical coupling algorithms to obtain coupled flow-deformation
response. Several representative numerical examples are presented to illustrate
the capability of the mathematical model and the performance of the

  Associated with High-density Lipoprotein Cholesterol in Two Asian Cohorts",,,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Standard approaches to analysing data in genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) ignore any potential functional relationships between genetic markers.
In contrast gene pathways analysis uses prior information on functional
structure within the genome to identify pathways associated with a trait of
interest. In a second step, important single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or
genes may be identified within associated pathways. Most pathways methods begin
by testing SNPs one at a time, and so fail to capitalise on the potential
advantages inherent in a multi-SNP, joint modelling approach. Here we describe
a dual-level, sparse regression model for the simultaneous identification of
pathways, genes and SNPs associated with a quantitative trait. Our method takes
account of various factors specific to the joint modelling of pathways with
genome-wide data, including widespread correlation between genetic predictors,
and the fact that variants may overlap multiple pathways. We use a resampling
strategy that exploits finite sample variability to provide robust rankings for
pathways, SNPs and genes. We test our method through simulation, and use it to
perform pathways-driven SNP selection in a search for pathways, genes and SNPs
associated with variation in serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC)
levels in two separate GWAS cohorts of Asian adults. By comparing results from
both cohorts we identify a number of candidate pathways including those
associated with cardiomyopathy, and T cell receptor and PPAR signalling.
Highlighted genes include those associated with the L-type calcium channel,
adenylate cyclase, integrin, laminin, MAPK signalling and immune function.

oscillate inertially. A correct estimation of the wave attenuation in such
bubbly media requires a realistic estimation of the power dissipated by the
oscillation of each bubble, by thermal diffusion in the gas and viscous
friction in the liquid. Both quantities and calculated numerically for a single
inertial bubble driven at 20 kHz, and are found to be several orders of
magnitude larger than the linear prediction. Viscous dissipation is found to be
the predominant cause of energy loss for bubbles small enough. Then, the
classical nonlinear Caflish equations describing the propagation of acoustic
waves in a bubbly liquid are recast and simplified conveniently. The main
harmonic part of the sound field is found to fulfill a nonlinear Helmholtz
equation, where the imaginary part of the squared wave number is directly
correlated with the energy lost by a single bubble. For low acoustic driving,
linear theory is recovered, but for larger drivings, namely above the Blake
threshold, the attenuation coefficient is found to be more than 3 orders of
magnitude larger then the linear prediction. A huge attenuation of the wave is
thus expected in regions where inertial bubbles are present, which is confirmed
by numerical simulations of the nonlinear Helmholtz equation in a 1D standing
wave configuration. The expected strong attenuation is not only observed but
furthermore, the examination of the phase between the pressure field and its
gradient clearly demonstrates that a traveling wave appears in the medium.

cloud of inertial cavitation bubbles was proposed. The wave attenuation was
calculated directly from the energy dissipated by a single bubble, the latter
being estimated directly from the fully nonlinear radial dynamics. The use of
this model in a mono-dimensional configuration has shown that the attenuation
near the vibrating emitter was much higher than predictions obtained from
linear theory, and that this strong attenuation creates a large traveling wave
contribution, even for closed domain where standing waves are normally
expected. In this paper, we show that, owing to the appearance of traveling
waves, the primary Bjerknes force near the emitter becomes very large and tends
to expel the bubbles up to a stagnation point. Two-dimensional axi-symmetric
computations of the acoustic field created by a large area immersed sonotrode
are also performed, and the paths of the bubbles in the resulting Bjerknes
force field are sketched. Cone bubble structures are recovered and compare
reasonably well to reported experimental results. The underlying mechanisms
yielding such structures is examined, and it is found that the conical
structure is generic and results from the appearance a sound velocity gradient
along the transducer area. Finally, a more complex system, similar to an
ultrasonic bath, in which the sound field results from the flexural vibrations
of a thin plate, is also simulated. The calculated bubble paths reveal the
appearance of other commonly observed structures in such configurations, such
as streamers and flare structures.

responses are high-dimensional is becoming an increasingly popular task in many
data mining applications. Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression often turns
out to be a useful model in these situations since it performs dimensionality
reduction by assuming the existence of a small number of latent factors that
may explain the linear dependence between input and output. In practice, the
number of latent factors to be retained, which controls the complexity of the
model and its predictive ability, has to be carefully selected. Typically this
is done by cross validating a performance measure, such as the predictive
error. Although cross validation works well in many practical settings, it can
be computationally expensive. Various extensions to PLS have also been proposed
for regularising the PLS solution and performing simultaneous dimensionality
reduction and variable selection, but these come at the expense of additional
complexity parameters that also need to be tuned by cross-validation. In this
paper we derive a computationally efficient alternative to leave-one-out cross
validation (LOOCV), a predicted sum of squares (PRESS) statistic for two-block
PLS. We show that the PRESS is nearly identical to LOOCV but has the
computational expense of only a single PLS model fit. Examples of the PRESS for
selecting the number of latent factors and regularisation parameters are
provided.

  Optimality of source-channel separation for communication with a fidelity
criterion when the channel is compound as defined by Csiszar and Korner in
their book and general as defined by Verdu and Han, is proved in Part I. It is
assumed that random codes are permitted. The word ""universal"" in the title of
this paper refers to the fact that the channel model is compound. The proof
uses a layered black-box or a layered input-output view-point. In particular,
only the end-to-end description of the channel as being capable of
communicating a source to within a certain distortion level is used when
proving separation. This implies that the channel model does not play any role
for separation to hold as long as there is a source model. Further implications
of the layered black-box view-point are discussed.
  Optimality of source-medium separation for multi-user communication with
fidelity criteria over a general, compound medium in the unicast setting is
proved in Part II, thus generalizing Part I to the unicast, multi-user setting.
  Part III gets to an understanding of the question, ""Why is a channel which is
capable of communicating a source to within a certain distortion level, also
capable of communicating bits at any rate less than the infimum of the rates
needed to code the source to within the distortion level"": this lies at the
heart of why optimality of separation for communication with a fidelity
criterion holds. The perspective taken to get to this understanding is a
randomized covering-packing perspective, and the proof is operational.

It frequently exhibits temporal variability, but it is not known if this
variability has a specific temporal patterning. This study explores these
synchronization/desynchronization patterns. We employ recently developed
techniques to analyze the fine temporal structure of phase-locking to study the
temporal patterning of synchrony of the human brain rhythms. We study neural
oscillations recorded by EEG in $\alpha$ and $\beta$ frequency bands in healthy
human subjects at rest and during the execution of a task. While the
phase-locking strength depends on many factors, dynamics of synchrony has a
very specific temporal pattern: synchronous states are interrupted by frequent,
but short desynchronization episodes. The probability for a desynchronization
episode to occur decreased with its duration. The transition matrix between
synchronized and desynchronized states has eigenvalues close to 0 and 1 where
eigenvalue 1 has multiplicity 1, and therefore if the stationary distribution
between these states is perturbed, the system converges back to the stationary
distribution very fast. The qualitative similarity of this patterning across
different subjects, brain states and electrode locations suggests that this may
be a general type of dynamics for the brain. Earlier studies indicate that not
all oscillatory networks have this kind of patterning of
synchronization/desynchronization dynamics. Thus the observed prevalence of
short (but potentially frequent) desynchronization events (length of one cycle
of oscillations) may have important functional implications for the brain.
Numerous short desynchronizations (as opposed to infrequent, but long
desynchronizations) may allow for a quick and efficient formation and break-up
of functionally significant neuronal assemblies.

and their GC-ratios and palindromic densities were calculated and plotted using
Mathematica. The palindromic densities-by-GC-ratios plot of randomly generated
sequences (palindromic density curve) exhibited a quadratic relationship and
was superimposed over the viral genome plot. It was observed that the viral
plots followed the curvature of the random sequences' quadratic curve,
signifying a directly proportional relationship between GC-content and
palindrome density in viral genomes. However, because viral genomes require
certain non-palindromic sequences to function, the palindromic densities of
most wild-type genomes were under the palindromic density curve. The variance
in palindrome densities of wild-type genomes in respect to the random
sequences' quadratic curve may be examined to determine evolutionary traits in
genomes. A better understanding of viral palindromic densities and GC-ratios
would help in understanding conserved secondary RNA structures in viral genomes
and future drug discovery. In addition, certain viral genomes were found to be

addition, we employ this framework to enable efficient repair of parity nodes
in existing codes that were originally constructed to address the repair of
only the systematic nodes. The basic idea behind our framework is to take
multiple instances of existing codes and add carefully designed functions of
the data of one instance to the other. Typical savings in data-read during

The calculated adiabatic index for these magnetized neutron stars exhibit rapid

observed glitches in some magnetars. We also discuss a perturbative calculation

To achieve this and to avoid the difficulty of propagating anisotropic

analysis with the parameters obtained by fitting to the numerical calculation

115423 (2012)] from first principles. In contrast to single-layer graphene, the
leading term of the out-of-plane component of the spin-orbit coupling in
bilayer graphene shows a Zeeman-like term with opposite effective magnetic
fields in the two valleys. This Zeeman-like term opens a spin relaxation
channel in the presence of intervalley scattering. It is shown that the
intervalley electron-phonon scattering, which has not been reported in the
previous literature, strongly suppresses the in-plane spin relaxation time at
high temperature whereas the intervalley short-range scattering plays an
important role in the in-plane spin relaxation especially at low temperature. A
marked nonmonotonic dependence of the in-plane spin relaxation time on
temperature with a minimum of several hundred picoseconds is predicted in the
absence of the short-range scatterers. This minimum is comparable to the
experimental data. Moreover, a peak in the electron density dependence of the
in-plane spin relaxation time at low temperature, which is very different from
the one in semiconductors, is predicted. We also find a rapid decrease in the
in-plane spin relaxation time with increasing initial spin polarization at low
temperature, which is opposite to the situation in both semiconductors and

analysis and illustration with an example, we show why the two methods give
different results for the bins which are crossed by the flux limit curves
$L=L_{lim}(z)$. Based on a combined sample simulated by a Monte Carlo method,
the estimate $\phi$ of two methods are compared with the input model LFs. The
two methods give identical and ideal estimate for the high luminosity points of
each redshift interval. However, for the low luminosity bins of all the
redshift intervals both methods give smaller estimate than the input model. We
conclude that once the LF is evolving with redshift, the classical binned
methods will unlikely give an ideal estimate over the total luminosity range.
Page & Carrera (2000) noticed that for objects close to the flux limit
$\phi_{1/V_{a}}$ nearly always to be too small. We believe this is due to the
arbitrary choosing of redshift and luminosity intervals. Because
$\phi_{1/V_{a}}$ is more sensitive to how the binning are chosen than
$\phi_{PC}$. We suggest a new binning method, which can improve the LFs
produced by the 1/Va method significantly, and also improve the LFs produced by
the PC methods. Our simulations show that after adopting this new binning, both
the 1/Va and PC methods have comparable results.

vital in determining the exact plasma heating mechanism. High resolution
spectroscopic observations of the off-limb corona were made using 25 cm
Norikura coronagraph, located at Norikura, Japan. Observations on a number of
days, were made simultaneously in four forbidden iron emission lines namely,
[Fe XI] 7892 \AA\ line, [Fe XIII] 10747 \AA & 10798 \AA\ lines and [Fe XIV]
5303 \AA\ line and on some days made only in [Fe XI] 7892 \AA\ and [Fe X] 6374
\AA\ lines. Using the temperature sensitive emission line ratios [Fe XIV] 5303
\AA/[Fe XIII] 10747 \AA, and [Fe XI] 7892 \AA/[Fe X] 6374 \AA\ we compute the
electron temperatures along 18 different loop structures observed on different
days. We find a significant negative temperature gradient in all the structures
observed in Fe XIV and Fe XIII and a positive temperature gradient in the
structures observed in Fe XI and Fe X. Combining these results with the
previous investigations by Singh and his collaborators, we infer that the loop
tops, in general, appear hotter when observed in colder lines and colder when
observed in relatively hotter lines as compared to their coronal foot points.
We suggest that this contrasting trend observed in the temperature variation
along the loop structures can be explained by a gradual interaction of
different temperature plasma. The exact mechanism responsible for this
interaction needs further quest and has potential to constrain loop heating
models.

rate of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) remains unresolved, with the single and
double degenerate scenarios remaining the leading contenders. The former
implies a large population of hot accreting white dwarfs with photospheric
temperatures of T ~ 10^5-10^6 K during some part of their accretion history. We
show that in early-type galaxies, a population of accreting white dwarfs large
enough to reproduce the SN Ia rate would contribute significantly to the
ionizing UV radiation expected from the stellar population. For mean stellar
ages < ~5 Gyr, single degenerate progenitors would dominate the ionizing
background produced by stars, increasing the continuum beyond the He
II-ionizing limit more than ten-fold. This opens a new avenue for constraining
the progenitors of SNe Ia, through consideration of the spatially extended
low-ionization emission-line regions now found in many early-type galaxies.
Modelling the expected emission, we show that one can constrain the
contribution of the single degenerate channel to the SN Ia rate in E/S0
galaxies from upper limits on the luminosity of He II recombination lines in
the optical and FUV. We discuss future directions, as well as possible
implications for the evolution of SNe Ia in old stellar populations.

ultraviolet (UV) and extreme UV (EUV) region. In this work, the significance of
such processes for solar atmosphere is studied. In the case of the solar
atmosphere the absorption processes with $A=$ H and $B=$ Mg and Si are treated
as dominant ones, but the cases $A=$ H and $B=$ Al and $A=$ He and $B=$ H are
also taken into consideration. The choice of just these species is caused by
the fact that, of the species relevant for the used solar-atmosphere model, it
was only for them that we could determine the necessary characteristics of the
corresponding molecular ions, i.e. the molecular potential curves and dipole
matrix elements. It is shown that the efficiency of the examined non-symmetric
processes within the rather wide corresponding quasi-molecular absorption bands
in the far-UV and EUV regions is comparable and sometimes even greater than the
intensity of the known symmetric ion-atom absorption processes, which are
included now in the models of the solar atmosphere. Consequently, the presented
results suggest that the non-symmetric ion-atom absorption processes also have
to be included \emph{ab initio} in the corresponding models of the stellar

impact area varies considerably for each link. Data from extensive experiments
are used to derive a multi-scale spatial weight model that is a function of the
fade level, i.e., the difference between the predicted and measured RSS, and of
the direction of RSS change. In addition, a measurement model is proposed which
gives a probability of a person locating inside the derived spatial model for
each given RSS measurement. A real-time radio tomographic imaging system is
described which uses channel diversity and the presented models. Experiments in
an open indoor environment, in a typical one-bedroom apartment and in a
through-wall scenario are conducted to determine the accuracy of the system. We
demonstrate that the new system is capable of localizing and tracking a person
with high accuracy (<0.30 m) in all the environments, without the need to
change the model parameters.

a Q-defined algebraic group A such that the abstract commensurator of Gamma is
isomorphic to A(Q) and Aut(Gamma) is commensurable with A(Z). Our proof uses
the algebraic hull construction, due to Mostow, to define an algebraic group H
so that commensurations of Gamma extend to Q-defined automorphisms of H. We
prove an analogous result for lattices in connected linear Lie groups whose
semisimple quotient satisfies superrigidity.

Process of branching is very important for making connections in central
nervous system. The interstitial branching along primary axon shaft occurs
during nervous system development. Growing axon makes pause in its movement and
leaves active points behind its terminal. The new branches appear from these
points. We suggest mathematical model to describe and investigate neural
network branching process. The model under consideration describes neural
network growth in which the concentration of axon guidance molecules manages
axon's growth. We model the interstitial branching from axon shaft. Numerical
simulations show that in the model framework axonal networks are similar to
neural network.

complexified real affine line arrangements that do not contain two parallel
lines. By Yoshinaga's minimal presentation, we can give positive homogeneous
presentations of the fundamental groups. We consider the associated monoids
defined by the presentations. It turns out that, in some cases, left (resp.
right) \emph{least common multiple} does not always exist. Hence, the monoids
are neither \emph{Garside} nor \emph{Artin}. Nevertheless, we will show that
they carry certain particular elements similar to the \emph{fundamental
elements} in Artin monoids, and that, by improving the classical method in
combinatorial group theory, they are \emph{cancellative monoids}. As a result,
we will show that the word problem can be solved and the center of them are
determined.

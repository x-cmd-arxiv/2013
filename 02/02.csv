subsystems coupled to it. We first derive tests for checking if a subsystem can
be plugged into (or unplugged from) an existing plant without spoiling overall
stability and constraint satisfaction. When this is possible, we show how to
automatize the design of local controllers so that it can be carried out in
parallel by smart actuators equipped with computational resources and capable
to exchange information with neighboring subsystems. In particular, local
controllers exploit tube-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) in order to
guarantee robustness with respect to physical coupling among subsystems.
Finally, an application of the proposed control design procedure to frequency
control in power networks is presented.

computer networks. In this work we propose a problem that considers the use of
rate adaptation as the energy saving strategy in networks. The problem is
modeled as an integral demand-routing problem in a network with discrete cost
functions at the links. The discreteness of the cost function comes from the
different states (bandwidths) at which links can operate and, in particular,
from the energy consumed at each state. This in its turn leads to the
non-convexity of the cost function, and thus adds complexity to solve this
problem. We formulate this routing problem as an integer program, and we show
that the general case of this problem is NP-hard, and even hard to approximate.
For the special case when the step ratio of the cost function is bounded, we
show that effective approximations can be obtained. Our main algorithm executes
two processes in sequence: relaxation and rounding. The relaxation process
eliminates the non-convexity of the cost function, so that the problem is
transformed into a fractional convex program solvable in polynomial time. After
that, a randomized rounding process is used to get a feasible solution for the
original problem. This algorithm provides a constant approximation ratio for
uniform demands and an approximation ratio of $O(\log^{\beta-1} d)$ for
non-uniform demands, where $\beta$ is a constant and $d$ is the largest demand.

underlying thermal component. Photospheric emission is indeed expected when the
relativistic outflow emerging from the central engine becomes transparent to
its own radiation, with a quasi-blackbody spectrum in absence of additional
sub-photospheric dissipation. However, its intensity strongly depends on the
acceleration mechanism - thermal or magnetic - of the flow. We aim to compute
the thermal and non-thermal emissions produced by an outflow with a variable
Lorentz factor, where the power injected at the origin is partially thermal
(fraction epsilon_th) and partially magnetic (fraction 1-epsilon_th). The
thermal emission is produced at the photosphere, and the non-thermal emission
in the optically thin regime. Apart from the value of epsilon_th, we want to
test how the other model parameters affect the observed ratio of the thermal to
non-thermal emission. If the non-thermal emission is made by internal shocks,
we self-consistently obtained the light curves and spectra of the thermal and
non-thermal components for any distribution of the Lorentz factor in the flow.
If the non-thermal emission results from magnetic reconnection we were unable
to produce a light curve and could only compare the respective non-thermal and
thermal spectra. In the different considered cases, we varied the model
parameters to see when the thermal component in the light curve and/or spectrum
is likely to show up or, on the contrary, to be hidden. We finally compared our
results to the proposed evidence for the presence of a thermal component in GRB
spectra. Focussing on GRB 090902B and GRB 10072B, we showed how these

which is sensitive the applied spatially periodic potential (the mathematical
setting is a pair of weakly coupled reaction-diffusion and Fokker-Planck
equations). We prove that this mechanism indeed generates unidirectional
transport by showing that the amount of mass in the wells of the potential
decreases/increases from left to right. The direction of transport is
unambiguously determined by the location of each minimum of the potential with
respect to the so-called diffusive mean of its adjacent maxima. The transport
can be generated not only by an asymmetric potential, but also by a symmetric
potential and asymmetric transition rates, and as a consequence of the general
result we derive explicit conditions when the latter happens. When the
transitions are localized on narrow active sites in the protein conformation
space, we find a more explicit characterization of the bulk transport

dynamics on finite strongly connected networks, applicable to several sexually
transmitted diseases and computer viruses. In this context, a theoretical
definition of endemic prevalence is easily obtained via the quasi-stationary
distribution (QSD). By representing the model as a percolation process and
utilising the property of duality, we also provide a theoretical definition of
invasion probability. We then show that, for undirected networks, the
probability of invasion from any given individual is equal to the
(probabilistic) endemic prevalence, following successful invasion, at the
individual (we also provide a relationship for the directed case). The total
(fractional) endemic prevalence in the population is thus equal to the average
invasion probability (across all individuals). Consequently, for such systems,
the regions or individuals already supporting a high level of infection are
likely to be the source of a successful invasion by another infectious agent.
This could be used to inform targeted interventions when there is a threat from
an emerging infectious disease.

constrained least-squares problem with regularization that consists of a linear
combination of an L_1 penalty for the coefficients and another L_1 penalty for
pairwise differences of the coefficients. This specification of the penalty
function encourages grouping of positively correlated predictors combined with
a sparsity solution. We construct an efficient algorithm to implement the
HORSES procedure. We show via simulation that the proposed method outperforms
other variable selection methods in terms of prediction error and parsimony.

and planets could have been formed by granular vs. granular collisions and that
central peaks and domes in complex craters were formed by a dynamic confinement
of part of the impacting projectile, rather than by the uplift of the target
terrain. A granulometric analysis of asteroids and central peaks and domes
inside complex craters, shows boulder size distributions consistent with our
hypothesis that crater internal features are the remnants of granular
impactors.

estimation in high dimensional sparse regression models with group structure.
The new estimator minimizes the square root of the residual sum of squares plus
a penalty term proportional to the sum of the Euclidean norms of groups of the
regression parameter vector. The net advantage of the method over the existing
Group Lasso (GL)-type procedures consists in the form of the proportionality
factor used in the penalty term, which for GSRL is independent of the variance
of the error terms. This is of crucial importance in models with more
parameters than the sample size, when estimating the variance of the noise
becomes as difficult as the original problem. We show that the GSRL estimator
adapts to the unknown sparsity of the regression vector, and has the same
optimal estimation and prediction accuracy as the GL estimators, under the same
minimal conditions on the model. This extends the results recently established
for the Square-Root Lasso, for sparse regression without group structure.
Moreover, as a new type of result for Square-Root Lasso methods, with or
without groups, we study correct pattern recovery, and show that it can be
achieved under conditions similar to those needed by the Lasso or
Group-Lasso-type methods, but with a simplified tuning strategy. We implement
our method via a new algorithm, with proved convergence properties, which,
unlike existing methods, scales well with the dimension of the problem. Our
simulation studies support strongly our theoretical findings.

parametric statistic models based on Neyman's $C(\alpha)$ approach. Such tests
are irregular in the sense that the first order derivative of the log
likelihood with respect to the heterogeneity parameter is identically zero, and
consequently the conventional Fisher information about the parameter is zero.
Nevertheless, local asymptotic optimality of the $C(\alpha)$ tests can be
established via LeCam's differentiability in quadratic mean and the limit
experiment approach. This leads to local alternatives of order $n^{-1/4}$. The
scalar case result is already familiar from existing literature and we extend
it to the multi-dimensional case. The new framework reveals that certain
regularity conditions commonly employed in earlier developments are
unnecessary, i.e. the symmetry or third moment condition imposed on the
heterogeneity distribution. Additionally, the limit experiment for the
multi-dimensional case suggests modifications on existing tests for slope
heterogeneity in cross sectional and panel data models that lead to power
improvement. Since the $C(\alpha)$ framework is not restricted to the
parametric model and the test statistics do not depend on the particular choice
of the heterogeneity distribution, it is useful for a broad range of
applications for testing parametric heterogeneity.

are known to persist for timescales comparable to their lifetimes. From a
theoretical perspective this is problematic, as it can be shown that simple
magnetic field configurations are always unstable. In non-barotropic stars,
stable stratification allows for a much wider range of magnetic field
structures than in barotropic stars, and helps stabilize them by making it
harder to induce radial displacements. Recent simulations by Braithwaite and
collaborators have shown that, in stably stratified stars, random initial
magnetic fields evolve into nearly axisymmetric configurations with both
poloidal and toroidal components, which then remain stable for some time. It is
desirable to provide an analytic study of the stability of such fields. We
write an explicit expression for a plausible equilibrium structure of an
axially symmetric magnetic field with both poloidal and toroidal components of
adjustable strengths, in a non-barotropic static fluid star, and study its
stability using the energy principle. We construct a displacement field that
should be a reasonable approximation to the most unstable mode of a toroidal
field, and confirm Braithwaite's result that a given toroidal field can be
stabilized by a poloidal field containing much less energy than the former.
This is consistent with the speculation that the toroidal field is the main
reservoir powering magnetar activity. The deformation of a neutron star caused
by the hidden toroidal field can also cause emission of gravitational waves.

traces of information flow can be obtained by looking at temporal sequences of

Here, we study causality trees in mobile-phone data, which can be represented
as a dynamical directed network. This representation of the data reveals the
existence of super-spreaders and super-receivers. We show that the tree
statistics, respectively the information spreading process, are extremely
sensitive to the in-out degree correlation exhibited by the users. We also
learn that a given information, e.g., a rumor, would require users to
retransmit it for more than 30 hours in order to cover a macroscopic fraction
of the system. Our analysis indicates that topological node-node correlations
of the underlying social network, while allowing the existence of information
loops, they also promote information spreading. Temporal correlations, and
therefore causality effects, are only visible as local phenomena and during
short time scales. These results are obtained through a combination of theory
and data analysis techniques.

approach, the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) onboard regularly imaged the

the dynamics of equatorial hot spots and their interactions with adjacent
latitudes. Hot spots are quasi-stable, rectangular dark areas on
visible-wavelength images, with defined eastern edges that sharply contrast
with surrounding clouds, but diffuse western edges serving as nebulous
boundaries with adjacent equatorial plumes. Hot spots exhibit significant
variations in size and shape over timescales of days and weeks. Some of these
changes correspond with passing vortex systems from adjacent latitudes
interacting with hot spots. Strong anticyclonic gyres present to the south and
southeast of the dark areas appear to circulate into hot spots. Impressive,
bright white plumes occupy spaces in between hot spots. Compact cirrus-like
'scooter' clouds flow rapidly through the plumes before disappearing within the
dark areas. These clouds travel at 150-200 m/s, much faster than the 100 m/s
hot spot and plume drift speed. This raises the possibility that the scooter
clouds may be more illustrative of the actual jet stream speed at these
latitudes. Most previously published zonal wind profiles represent the drift
speed of the hot spots at their latitude from pattern matching of the entire
longitudinal image strip. If a downward branch of an equatorially-trapped
Rossby waves controls the overall appearance of hot spots, however, the
westward phase velocity of the wave leads to underestimates of the true jet
stream speed.

developments in the modeling of stellar rotation. Using new published
non-rotating and rotating stellar tracks, we study the integrated properties of
synthetic stellar populations and find that the UV to SFR calibration for the
rotating stellar population is 30% smaller than for the non-rotating stellar
population, and 40% smaller for the Halpha to SFR calibration. These reductions
translate to smaller SFR estimates made from observed UV and Halpha
luminosities. Using the UV and Halpha fluxes of a sample of ~300 local
galaxies, we derive a total (i.e., sky-coverage corrected) SFR within 11 Mpc of
120-170 Msun/yr and 80-130 Msun/yr for the non-rotating and rotating
estimators, respectively. Independently, the number of core-collapse supernovae
discovered in the same volume requires a total SFR of 270^{+110}_{-80} Msun/yr,
suggesting a mild tension with the SFR estimates made with rotating
calibrations. More generally, when compared with the estimated SFR, the local
supernova discoveries strongly constrain any physical effects that might
increase the energy output of massive stars, including, but not limited to,
stellar rotation. The cosmic SFR and cosmic supernova rate data on the other
hand show the opposite trend, with the cosmic SFR almost double that inferred
from cosmic supernovae, constraining a significant decrease in the energy
output of massive stars. Together, these lines of evidence suggest that the
true SFR calibration factors cannot be too far from their canonical values.

accretion history (MAH) and mass profile of cold dark matter halos. We find
that the mean density within the scale radius, r_{-2} (where the halo density
profile has isothermal slope), is directly proportional to the critical density
of the Universe at the time when the main progenitor's virial mass equals the
mass enclosed within r_{-2}. Scaled to these characteristic values of mass and
density, the mean MAH, expressed in terms of the critical density of the
Universe, M(\rho_{crit}(z)), resembles that of the enclosed density profile,
M(<\rho >), at z=0. Both follow closely the NFW profile, suggesting that the
similarity of halo mass profiles originates from the mass-independence of halo
MAHs. Support for this interpretation is provided by outlier halos whose
accretion histories deviate from the NFW shape; their mass profiles show
correlated deviations from NFW and are better approximated by Einasto profiles.
Fitting both M(<\rho >) and M(\rho_{crit}) with either NFW or Einasto profiles
yield concentration and shape parameters that are correlated, confirming and
extending earlier work linking the concentration of a halo with its accretion
history. These correlations also confirm that halo structure is insensitive to
initial conditions: only halos whose accretion histories differ greatly from
the NFW shape show noticeable deviations from NFW in their mass profiles. As a
result, the NFW profile provides acceptable fits to hot dark matter halos,
which do not form hierarchically, and for fluctuation power spectra other than
CDM. Our findings, however, predict a subtle but systematic dependence of mass
profile shape on accretion history which, if confirmed, would provide strong
support for the link between accretion history and halo structure we propose
here.

a quantization of the zero-bias tunneling conductance at zero temperature. In
order to understand this phenomenon, we have developed a framework, based on
real-time Keldysh technique, which allows one to compute tunneling conductance
at finite temperature and voltage in a realistic experimental setup. Our
approach allows one to understand this transport phenomenon from a more general
perspective by including the effect of interactions in the nanowire, which
sometimes results in a drastic departure from the non-interacting predictions.
Thus, our results provide a key insight for the tunneling experiments aiming at
detecting Majorana particles in one-dimensional nanowire devices.

collisions varying as $\cos(2\phi)$ and denoted by symbol $v_2$ is
conventionally interpreted to represent ""elliptic flow,"" a hydrodynamic
manifestation of the initial-state \aa overlap geometry. Several numerical
methods are used to estimate $v_2$, resulting in various combinations of ""flow""
and ""nonflow"" that reveal systematic biases in the $v_2$ estimates. QCD jets
contribute strongly to azimuth correlations and specifically to the
$\cos(2\phi)$ component. Purpose: We question the extent of jet-related
(""nonflow"") bias in and hydrodynamic ""flow"" interpretations of $v_2$
measurements. Method: We introduce two-dimensional (2D) model fits to angular
correlation data that distinguish accurately between jet-related correlation
components and a {\em nonjet azimuth quadrupole} that might represent ""elliptic
flow"" if that were relevant. We compare measured jet-related and ""flow""-related
data systematics and determine the jet-related contribution to $v_2$
measurements. Results: Jet structure does introduce substantial bias to
conventional $v_2$ measurements, making interpretation difficult. The nonjet
quadrupole exhibits very simple systematics on centrality and collision
energy---the two variables factorize. Within a \auau centrality interval where
jets show no indication of rescattering or medium effects the nonjet quadrupole
amplitude rises to 60% of its maximum value. Conclusions: Disagreements between
nonjet quadrupole systematics and hydro theory expectations, the large
quadrupole amplitudes observed in more-peripheral \auau collisions and a
significant nonzero value in \nn $\approx$ \pp collisions strongly suggest that
the nonjet quadrupole does not arise from a hydrodynamic ""flow"" mechanism.

after applying a model for the measurement errors that accounts for binary
orbital motion. We find that the Fornax, Sculptor, and Sextans dSphs are
consistent with having binary populations similar to that of Milky Way field
binaries to within 68% confidence limits, whereas the Carina dSph is remarkably
deficient in binaries with periods less than ~10 years. If Carina is assumed to
have a period distribution identical to that of the Milky Way field, its
best-fit binary fraction is 0.14^{+0.28}_{-0.05}, and is constrained to be less
than 0.5 at the 90% confidence level; thus it is unlikely to host a binary
population identical to that of the Milky Way field. By contrast, the best-fit
binary fraction of the combined sample of all four galaxies is
0.46^{+0.13}_{-0.09}, consistent with that of Milky Way field binaries. More
generally, we infer probability distributions in binary fraction, mean orbital
period, and dispersion of periods for each galaxy in the sample. Looking ahead
to future surveys, we show that the allowed parameter space of binary fraction
and period distribution parameters in dSphs will be narrowed significantly by a
large multi-epoch survey. However, there is a degeneracy between the parameters

of Projected Entangled Pair States to construct (on the cylinder)Resonating
Valence Bond (RVB) states including both nearest-neighbor and next-nearest
neighbor singlet bonds. Our ansatz -- dubbed ""simplex spin liquid"" -- allows
for an asymmetry between the two types of triangles (of order 2-3% in the
energy density after optimization) leading to the breaking of inversion
symmetry. We show that the topological Z_2 structure is still preserved and, by
considering the presence or the absence of spinon and vison lines along an
infinite cylinder, we explicitly construct four orthogonal RVB Minimally
Entangled States. The spinon and vison coherence lengths are extracted from a
finite size scaling w.r.t the cylinder perimeter of the energy splittings of
the four sectors and are found to be of the order of the lattice spacing. The
entanglement spectrum of a partitioned (infinite) cylinder is found to be
gapless suggesting the occurrence, on a cylinder with {\it real} open
boundaries, of gapless edge modes formally similar to Luttinger liquid
(non-chiral) spin and charge modes. When inversion symmetry is spontaneously
broken, the RVB spin liquid exhibits an extra Ising degeneracy, which might
have been observed in recent exact diagonalisation studies.

present a simplified framework which characterizes the effects of these states
on Higgs physics by way of tree level mixing (with neutral scalars) and loop
level modifications (from electrically charged states), all expressed in terms
of three mixing angles and three loop parameters, respectively. The theory
parameters are constrained and in some cases even fixed by ratios of Higgs
production and decay rates. Our setup is simpler than a general effective
operator analysis, in that we discard parameters irrelevant to Higgs
observables while retaining complex correlations among measurements that arise
due to the underlying mixing and radiative effects. We show that certain
correlated observations are forbidden, e.g. a depleted ratio of Higgs
production from gluon fusion versus vector boson fusion together with a
depleted ratio of Higgs decays to bb versus WW. Moreover, we study the strong
correlation between the Higgs decay rate to gamma gamma and WW and how it can
be violated in the presence of additional electrically charged particles. Our
formalism maps straightforwardly onto a variety of new physics models, such as
the NMSSM. We show, for example, that with a Higgsino of mass > 100 GeV and a
singlet-Higgs coupling of lambda=0.7, the photon signal strength can deviate
from the vector signal strength by up to ~ 40-60% while depleting the vector

connected component is a single Schur function. In this paper, we improve on
Assaf's axiomatization of such graphs, giving locally testable criteria that

equivalence graphs by describing a broader class of graphs that correspond to
an explicit Schur expansion in terms of Yamanouchi words. Along the way, we
demonstrate several symmetries in the structure of dual equivalence graphs. We
then apply these techniques to give explicit Schur expansions for a family of

forcing many wireless network operators to look towards refarming their 2G
spectrum and deploy more spectrally efficient Long Term Evolution (LTE)
technology. However, mobile network operators face a challenge when it comes to
spectrum refarming because 2G technologies such as Global System for Mobile
(GSM) is still widely used for low bandwidth machine-to-machine (M2M) devices.
M2M devices typically have long life cycles, e.g. smart meters, and it is
expensive to migrate these devices to newer technology since a truck roll will
typically be required to the site where a device is deployed. Furthermore, with
cost of 2G modules several times less than that of LTE, even newly deployed M2M
devices tend to adopt 2G technology. Nevertheless, operators are keen to either
force their 2G M2M customers to migrate so that they can refarm the spectrum or
set aside a portion of the 2G spectrum for continuing operating 2G and only
refarm the rest for LTE. In this paper we propose a novel solution to provide
GSM connectivity within an LTE carrier through an efficient overlay by
reserving a few physical resource blocks for GSM. With this approach, operators
can refarm their 2G spectrum to LTE efficiently while still providing some GSM
connectivity to their low data rate M2M customers. Furthermore, spectrum can be
dynamically shared between LTE and GSM. An approach similar to that proposed in
this paper can also be applied for other narrow band technology overlays over
LTE.

of the dynamics under cooling is more sudden and the jump of specific heat at
the glass transition is generally larger in fragile liquids than in strong
ones. Despite the importance of this quantity in classifying liquids,
explaining what aspects of the microscopic structure controls fragility remains
a challenge. Surprisingly, experiments indicate that the linear elasticity of
the glass -- a purely local property of the free energy landscape -- is a good
predictor of fragility. In particular, materials presenting a large excess of
soft elastic modes, the so-called boson peak, are strong. This is also the case
for network liquids near the rigidity percolation, known to affect elasticity.
Here we introduce a model of the glass transition based on the assumption that
particles can organize locally into distinct configurations, which are coupled
spatially via elasticity. The model captures the mentioned observations
connecting elasticity and fragility. We find that materials presenting an
abundance of soft elastic modes have little elastic frustration: energy is

The broad bandwidth signal received by the antenna is divided into sub-bands

filter banks: a diplexer with two sub-bands and a log-periodic channelizer with
seven contiguous sub-bands. These detectors have receiver efficiencies of
20-40% and percent level polarization isolation. Superconducting
transition-edge sensor bolometers detect the power in each sub-band and
polarization. We demonstrate circularly symmetric beam patterns, high
polarization isolation, accurately positioned bands, and high optical

intensity and polarization at millimeter through sub-millimeter wavelengths. As
compared with an imaging array of pixels measuring only one band, simultaneous
measurements of multiple bands in each pixel has the potential to result in a
higher signal-to-noise measurement while also providing spectral information.

bypasses the curved sky complications of traditional interferometry and so is
particularly well suited to the analysis of wide-field radio interferometers.
It enables compact and computationally efficient representations of the data
and its statistics that allow new ways of approaching important problems like
map-making and foreground removal. In particular, we show how it enables the
use of the Karhunen-Loeve transform as a highly effective foreground filter,
suppressing realistic foreground residuals for our fiducial example by at least
a factor twenty below the 21cm signal even in highly contaminated regions of
the sky. This is despite the presence of the angle-frequency mode mixing
inherent in real-world instruments with frequency-dependent beams. We show,
using Fisher forecasting, that foreground cleaning has little effect on power
spectrum constraints compared to hypothetical foreground-free measurements.
Beyond providing a natural real-world data analysis framework for 21cm
telescopes now under construction and future experiments, this formalism allows
accurate power spectrum forecasts to be made that include the interplay of
design constraints and realistic experimental systematics with twenty-first

countably infinite. The Pitman-Yor process, a generalization of Dirichlet
process, provides a tractable prior distribution over the space of countably
infinite discrete distributions, and has found major applications in Bayesian
non-parametric statistics and machine learning. Here we show that it also
provides a natural family of priors for Bayesian entropy estimation, due to the
fact that moments of the induced posterior distribution over $H$ can be
computed analytically. We derive formulas for the posterior mean (Bayes' least
squares estimate) and variance under Dirichlet and Pitman-Yor process priors.
Moreover, we show that a fixed Dirichlet or Pitman-Yor process prior implies a
narrow prior distribution over $H$, meaning the prior strongly determines the
entropy estimate in the under-sampled regime. We derive a family of continuous
mixing measures such that the resulting mixture of Pitman-Yor processes
produces an approximately flat prior over $H$. We show that the resulting
Pitman-Yor Mixture (PYM) entropy estimator is consistent for a large class of
distributions. We explore the theoretical properties of the resulting
estimator, and show that it performs well both in simulation and in application

chemical evolution timescale and the turbulent eddy-turnover timescale are
comparable at typical GMC conditions, molecules evolve via inherently
non-equilibrium chemistry which is strongly coupled to the dynamical evolution
of the cloud.
  Current numerical simulation techniques, which include at most three decades
in length scale, can just begin to bridge the divide between the global
dynamical time of supersonic turbulent GMCs, and the thermal and chemical
evolution within the thin post-shock cooling layers of their background
turbulence. We address this GMC astrochemical scales problem using a solution
methodology, which permits both complex three-dimensional turbulent dynamics as
well as accurate treatment of non-equilibrium post-shock thermodynamics and
chemistry.
  We present the current methodology in the context of the larger scope of
physical processes important in understanding the chemical evolution of GMCs,
including gas-phase chemistry, dust grains and surface chemistry, and turbulent
heating. We present results of a new Lagrangian verification test for
supersonic turbulence. We characterize the evolution of these species according
to the dimensionless local post-shock Damk\""{o}hler number, which quantifies
the ratio of the dynamical time in the post-shock cooling flow to the chemical
reaction time of a given species.
  Lastly, we discuss implications of this work to the selection of GMC

lead to certain lower bounds on the percolation threshold $p_c$ that become
progressively tighter as $d$ increases and asymptotically exact as $d$ becomes
large. These lower-bound estimates depend on the structure of the
$d$-dimensional lattice and whether site or bond percolation is being
considered. We obtain explicit bounds on $p_c$ for both site and bond
percolation on five different lattices: $d$-dimensional generalizations of the
simple-cubic, body-centered-cubic and face-centered-cubic Bravais lattices as
well as the $d$-dimensional generalizations of the diamond and kagom{\'e} (or

available simulation results across dimensions (up through $d=13$ in some

estimates of $p_c$ in relatively low dimensions and becomes increasingly
accurate as $d$ grows. We also derive high-dimensional asymptotic expansions

tool assisting in the proof of theorems concerning these class algebra

luminous blazar PKS1510-089 observed in the GeV range with the Large Area
Telescope (LAT) onboard the Fermi satellite during the period 2011 September --
December. By investigating the properties of the detected three major flares
with the shortest possible time binning allowed by the photon statistics, we
find a variety of temporal characteristics and variability patterns. This
includes a clearly asymmetric profile (with a faster flux rise and a slower
decay) of the flare resolved on sub-daily timescales, a superposition of many
short uncorrelated flaring events forming the apparently coherent
longer-duration outburst, and a huge single isolated outburst unresolved down
to the timescale of three-hours. In the latter case we estimate the
corresponding gamma-ray flux doubling timescale to be below one hour, which is
extreme and never previously reported for any active galaxy in the GeV range.
The other unique finding is that the total power released during the studied
rapid and high-amplitude flares constitute the bulk of the power radiatively
dissipated in the source, and a significant fraction of the total kinetic
luminosity of the underlying relativistic outflow. Our analysis allows us to
access directly the characteristic timescales involved in shaping the energy
dissipation processes in the source, and to provide constraints on the location

curves indicates that the eclipsing pair is a W-type overcontact binary with
parameters of q=2.578, i=83.3 deg, $\Delta T$=27 K, f=28 %, and l3=2~3 %. The
asymmetric light curves in 2007 were satisfactorily modeled by a cool spot on
either of the eclipsing components from a magnetic dynamo. Including our 95
timing measurements, a total of 414 times of minimum light spanning about 82 yr
were used for a period study. A detailed analysis of the eclipse timing diagram
revealed that the orbital period of EP And has varied as a combination of an
upward-opening parabola and two periodic variations, with cycle lengths of
P3=44.6 yr and P4=1.834 yr and semi-amplitudes of K3=0.0100 d and K4=0.0039 d,
respectively. The observed period increase at a fractional rate of
+1.39x10^{-10} is in excellent agreement with that calculated from the W-D code
and can be plausibly explained by some combination of mass transfer from the
primary to the secondary star and angular momentum loss due to magnetic
braking. The most reasonable explanation for both cycles is a pair of
light-travel-time effects driven by the possible existence of a third and
fourth component with projected masses of M3=0.25 Msun and M4=0.90 Msun. The
more massive companion could be revealed using high-resolution spectroscopic
data extending over the course of a few years and could also be a binary
itself. It is possible that the circumbinary objects may have played an
important role in the formation and evolution of the eclipsing pair, which
would cause it to have a short initial orbital period and thus evolve into an
overcontact configuration by angular momentum loss.

the role of the width and depth of Quantum Well (QW) active region, below and
above the lasing threshold. The device properties depend on both, the number of
bound QW states and on closeness of the highest bound states to conduction or
valence band offset. The lasing action may not exist at certain widths or
hights of QW, and the threshold current is a discontinuous function of these

Discontinuities in characteristics are found, at certain conditions, in

We show that the involution on $L_K(E)$ is proper if the involution on $K$ is
positive definite, even in the case when the graph $E$ is not necessarily
finite or row-finite.
  It has been shown that the Leavitt path algebra $L_K(E)$ is regular if and
only if $E$ is acyclic. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for
$L_{K}(E)$ to be $^\ast$-regular (i.e. regular with proper involution). This
characterization of $^\ast$-regularity of a Leavitt path algebra is given in
terms of an algebraic property of $K,$ not just a graph-theoretic property of

properties of a Leavitt path algebra in terms of graph-theoretic properties of
$E$ alone.
  As a corollary, we show that Handelman's conjecture (stating that every
$^\ast$-regular ring is unit-regular) holds for Leavitt path algebras.
Moreover, its generalized version for rings with local units also continues to
hold for Leavitt path algebras over arbitrary graphs.

equivalence $\sim^{a}$ on projections (or, in general, idempotents) defined by

There were attempts to unify the two approaches (see [10]).
  In this work, our agenda is three-fold: (1) We study assumptions on a ring
with involution that guarantee the existence of a well-behaved dimension
defined for any general equivalence relation on projections $\sim.$ (2) By
interpreting $\sim$ as $\sim^{a},$ we prove the existence of a well-behaved
dimension of strongly semihereditary rings with a positive definite involution.

discover compensatory behaviors in unanticipated situations. This algorithm
equips the robot with a self-model and discovers new behaviors by learning to
avoid those that perform differently in the self-model and in reality. Our
algorithm thus does not identify the damaged parts but it implicitly searches
for efficient behaviors that do not use them. We evaluate the T-Resilience
algorithm on a hexapod robot that needs to adapt to leg removal, broken legs
and motor failures; we compare it to stochastic local search, policy gradient
and the self-modeling algorithm proposed by Bongard et al. The behavior of the
robot is assessed on-board thanks to a RGB-D sensor and a SLAM algorithm. Using
only 25 tests on the robot and an overall running time of 20 minutes,
T-Resilience consistently leads to substantially better results than the other

  Final State at CDF","thesis",,,"FERMILAB-THESIS-2013-01","hep-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This thesis presents the evidence, at 3.08 sigma, for the associate
production of massive vector bosons (W and Z) in a final state with one lepton,
MET and HF-tagged jets, measured with the complete CDF II dataset (9.4fb^-1 of
data). The signals, both inclusive diboson production and WW vs WZ/ZZ
separately, were extracted from the invariant mass distribution,
M_inv(jet1,jet2), of single and double HF-tagged jet pairs. For single-tagged
events the b quark vs c quark discrimination was obtained by using a
bi-dimensional distribution M_inv(jet1,jet2) vs a flavor-serapator NN. The
results, consistent with the SM prediction, confirm the CDF capability of
identify a small signal in this challenging final state. In particular we also
report the previous version of this analysis, performed with a dataset of
7.5fb^-1 that was the first evidence of diboson production in lnu+HF final
state at a hadron collider. Beyond the pure testing of SM predicted processes,
several of the techniques developed for this thesis were also applied to the WH
search at CDF, with a relevant improvement of the sensitivity to this process.

investigated using the stellar evolution calculations and the self-consistent
solution of the equations of radiation hydrodynamics and turbulent convection.
The stars with initial masses 6M_odot<=M_zams<=28 M_odot and the initial
chemical composition X=0.7, 0.004<=Z<=0.008 are shown to be unstable against
fundamental mode oscillations with periods from 17 to 1200 days as they become
helium burning red supergiants. The period-luminosity relation slightly depends
on the mass loss rate varying with a factor of three, whereas its dependence on
the metal abundance is delta M_bol=0.89 delta log Z. In comparison with
galactic red supergiants (Z=0.02) the low metal abundances in red supergiants
of Magellanic Clouds are responsible for their higher effective temperatures
and substantially narrower ranges of evolutionary stellar radius change during
helium burning. Therefore on the period-mass diagram the red supergiants of
Magellanic Clouds are located within the strip with width of delta log M =
0.09, so that the uncertainty of mass evaluation of the red supergiant with the
known pulsational period is nearly 25%.

  for Lambek Calculus","29 pages, pending publication in Annals of Pure and Applied Logic",,"10.1016/j.apal.2013.05.009",,"math.LO cs.CL math.CT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Distributional Compositional Categorical (DisCoCat) model is a
mathematical framework that provides compositional semantics for meanings of
natural language sentences. It consists of a computational procedure for
constructing meanings of sentences, given their grammatical structure in terms
of compositional type-logic, and given the empirically derived meanings of
their words. For the particular case that the meaning of words is modelled
within a distributional vector space model, its experimental predictions,
derived from real large scale data, have outperformed other empirically
validated methods that could build vectors for a full sentence. This success
can be attributed to a conceptually motivated mathematical underpinning, by
integrating qualitative compositional type-logic and quantitative modelling of
meaning within a category-theoretic mathematical framework.
  The type-logic used in the DisCoCat model is Lambek's pregroup grammar.
Pregroup types form a posetal compact closed category, which can be passed, in
a functorial manner, on to the compact closed structure of vector spaces,
linear maps and tensor product. The diagrammatic versions of the equational
reasoning in compact closed categories can be interpreted as the flow of word
meanings within sentences. Pregroups simplify Lambek's previous type-logic, the
Lambek calculus, which has been extensively used to formalise and reason about
various linguistic phenomena. The apparent reliance of the DisCoCat on
pregroups has been seen as a shortcoming. This paper addresses this concern, by
pointing out that one may as well realise a functorial passage from the
original type-logic of Lambek, a monoidal bi-closed category, to vector spaces,
or to any other model of meaning organised within a monoidal bi-closed
category. The corresponding string diagram calculus, due to Baez and Stay, now
depicts the flow of word meanings.

collected and analyzed after temperature was elevated by physical exercise or
by exposure to external heat. The images of erythrocytes and vesicles were
analyzed by the light microscopy system with spatial resolution of better than
90 nm. The samples were observed in an aqueous environment and required no
freezing, dehydration, staining, shadowing, marking or any other manipulation.
Temperature elevation, whether passive or through exercise, resulted in
significant concentration increase of structurally transformed erythrocytes
(echinocytes) and vesicles in blood. At temperature of 37 oC, mean vesicle
concentrations and diameters in human and rat blood were (1.50+-0.35)x10^6 and
(1.4+-0.2)x10^6 vesicles/{\mu}L, and 0.365+-0.065 and 0.436+-0.03 {\mu}m,
respectively. It was estimated that 80% of all vesicles found in human blood
are smaller than 0.4 {\mu}m. Thermodynamic analysis of experimental and
literature data showed that erythrocyte transformation, vesicle release and
other associated processes are driven by entropy with enthalpy-entropy
compensation. It is suggested that physical state of hydrated cell membrane is
responsible for the compensation. The increase of vesicle number related to
elevated temperatures may be indicative of the heat stress level and serve as
diagnostic of erythrocyte stability and human performance.

density on road networks that we call 2D-traffic fundamental diagram. We show

First, the case of a junction managed with a priority rule is presented, four
traffic phases are identified and described, and a good analytic approximation
of the fundamental diagram is obtained by computing a generalized eigenvalue of
the dynamics of the system. Then, the model is extended to the case of two
junctions, and finally to a regular city. The system still presents mainly four
phases. The role of a critical circuit of non-priority roads appears clearly in
the two junctions case. In Section 4, we use traffic light controls to improve
the traffic diagram. We present the improvements obtained by open-loop, local
feedback, and global feedback strategies. A comparison based on the response
times to reach the stationary regime is also given. Finally, we show the
importance of the design of the junction. It appears that if the junction is
enough large, the traffic is almost not slowed down by the junction.

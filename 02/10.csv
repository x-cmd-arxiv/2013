nonlinear elements, in the presence of photon leakage and driven by a coherent
source. The nonlinear couplings lead to photon hopping and to nearest-neighbor
Kerr terms. By tuning the system parameters, the steady state of the array can
exhibit a photon crystal associated with a periodic modulation of the photon
blockade. In some cases, the crystalline ordering may coexist with phase
synchronization. The class of cavity arrays we consider can be built with
superconducting circuits of existing technology.

magnetized inhomogeneities under two concurrent hypotheses: a phase of quasi-de
Sitter dynamics driven by a single inflaton field and the simultaneous presence
of a spectator field coupled to gravity and to the gauge sector. Instead of
invoking ad hoc correlations between the various components, the system of
scalar inhomogeneities is diagonalized in terms of two gauge-invariant
quasi-normal modes whose weighted sum gives the curvature perturbations on
comoving orthogonal hypersurfaces. The predominance of the conventional
adiabatic scalar mode implies that the growth rate of magnetized
inhomogeneities must not exceed 2.2 in Hubble units if the conventional
inflationary phase is to last about 70 efolds and for a range of slow roll
parameters between 0.1 and 0.001. Longer and shorter durations of the quasi-de
Sitter stage lead, respectively, either to tighter or to looser bounds which
are anyway more constraining than the standard backreaction demands imposed on
the gauge sector. Since a critical growth rate of order 2 leads to a quasi-flat
magnetic energy spectrum, the upper bounds on the growth rate imply a lower
bound on the magnetic spectral index. The advantages of the uniform curvature
gauge are emphasized and specifically exploited throughout the treatment of the
multicomponent system characterizing this class of problems.

long-range magnetic order involving both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic
components has been revealed above the critical field H$_C\sim $ 6T at
temperature T=0.05K. The magnetic structure indicates that the geometrical
frustration of the prototype hexagonal lattice is not fully relieved in the
low-temperature orthorhombic phase. The suppression of magnetic ordering by the
remanent frustration is the key factor stabilizing the non-magnetic singlet
ground state in zero field. Temperature dependent measurements in the applied
field H=12T revealed that the long-range ordering persists up to temperatures
significantly higher than the spin gap indicating that this phase is not
directly related to the singlet-triplet excitation. Combining our neutron
diffraction results with the previously published phase diagram, we support the
existence of an intermediate disordered phase as the first excitation from the
non-magnetic singlet ground state. Based on our results, we propose
YbAl$_3$C$_3$ as a new material for studying the quantum phase transitions of

distinguish the intrinsic photoresponse of monodisperse semiconducting (99%)
single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) from the extrinsic photoresponse of the
substrate. A persistent positive photocurrent induced by near-IR excitation is
attributed to the generation of free carriers by inter-band excitation in
SWCNTs. For shorter excitation wavelengths, absorption by the Si substrate
generates two types of photocurrent: a transient positive photoresponse,
identified as a displacement current, and a persistent negative photocurrent
that arises from photogating of the SWCNT thin film.

the CRISP code calculations by means of the Bohr-Wheeler model. The fission
cross sections, the fissility and the number of nucleons evaporated by the

to the problem of quantization of the gravitational field. There can be many
valid approaches, each of which should be judged by the domain of its
applicability to various phenomena. If two approaches have overlapping domains,
the relation between them then itself becomes a subject of study. We advocate
an approach to general relativity based on the unimodular group, which
emphasizes the physical significance and measurability of the conformal and

where the deformation of the membrane is not prescribed, but instead the

introduce two specific models for such active internal forcing: one where a

three-wave interactions. The resonant parametric instability is a well-known
form of three-wave interaction in which a primary wave of frequency $\omega_a$
excites a pair of secondary waves of frequency $\omega_b+\omega_c \simeq
\omega_a$. Here we consider a nonresonant form of three-wave interaction in
which a low-frequency primary wave excites a high-frequency p-mode and a
low-frequency g-mode such that $\omega_b+\omega_c >>\omega_a$. We show that a
p-mode can couple so strongly to a g-mode of similar radial wavelength that
this type of interaction is unstable even if the primary wave amplitude is
small. As an application, we analyze the stability of the tide in coalescing
neutron star binaries to p-g mode coupling. We find that the equilibrium tide
and dynamical tide are both p-g unstable at gravitational wave frequencies
f_{gw} > 20 Hz and drive p-g pairs to significant energies on very short
timescales (much less than the orbital decay time). Resonant parametric
coupling to the tide is, by contrast, either stable or drives modes at a much
smaller rate. We do not solve for the saturation of the instability and
therefore cannot say precisely how it influences neutron star binaries.
However, we show that if even a single daughter mode saturates near its wave
breaking amplitude, the p-g instability of the equilibrium tide: (i) induces
significant orbital phase errors ($\Delta \phi$ > 1 radian) that accumulate
primarily at low frequencies (f_{gw} < 50 Hz) and (ii) heats the neutron star
core to T~10^{10} K. Since there are >100 unstable daughters, $\Delta \phi$ and
T are potentially much larger than these values. Tides might therefore
significantly influence the gravitational wave signal and electromagnetic
emission from neutron star binaries at much larger orbital separations than
previously thought.

network states represent one of the simplest generalizations of matrix product

states encode a one-dimensional entanglement structure, tree tensor network
states encode a tree entanglement structure, allowing for a more flexible
description of general molecules. We describe an optimal tree tensor network
state algorithm for quantum chemistry. We introduce the concept of
half-renormalization which greatly improves the efficiency of the calculations.
Using our efficient formulation we demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of
tree tensor network states versus matrix product states. We carry out benchmark
calculations both on tree systems (hydrogen trees and \pi-conjugated
dendrimers) as well as non-tree molecules (hydrogen chains, nitrogen dimer, and
chromium dimer). In general, tree tensor network states require much fewer
renormalized states to achieve the same accuracy as matrix product states. In
non-tree molecules, whether this translates into a computational savings is
system dependent, due to the higher prefactor and computational scaling
associated with tree algorithms. In tree like molecules, tree network states
are easily superior to matrix product states. As an ilustration, our largest
dendrimer calculation with tree tensor network states correlates 110 electrons
in 110 active orbitals.

time. The giant planets migrated significant distances to reach their current
locations, and evidence of that migration's influence on the Solar system
abounds. That migration's pace, and the distance over which it occurred, is
still heavily debated. Some models feature systems in which the giant planets
were initially in an extremely compact configuration, in which Uranus and
Neptune are chaotically scattered into the outer Solar system. Others feature
architectures that were initially more relaxed, and smoother, more sedate
migration. To determine which of these scenarios best represents the formation
of our Solar system, we must turn to the structure of the system's small body
populations, in which the scars of that migration are still clearly visible.
  We present the first results of a program investigating the effect of giant
planet migration on the reservoirs of small bodies that existed at that time.
As the planets migrate, they stir these reservoirs, scattering vast numbers of
small bodies onto dynamically unstable orbits in the outer Solar system. The
great majority of those bodies are rapidly removed from the system, through
collisions and ejections, but a small number become captured as planetary
Trojans or irregular satellites. Others are driven by the migration, leading to
a significant sculpting of the asteroid belt and trans-Neptunian region.
  The capture and retention efficiencies to these stable reservoirs depend on
the particular migration scenario used. Advocates of chaotic migration from an
initially compact scenario argue that smoother, more sedate migration cannot
explain the observed populations of Trojans and irregular satellites. Our
results draw a strikingly different picture, revealing that such smooth
migration is perfectly capable of reproducing the observed populations.

Gauss hypergeometric functions, extended Appell's hypergeometric functions
$\mathbf{F}_{1}^{(\kappa_{l})}$, $\mathbf{F}_{2}^{(\kappa_{l})}$, and extended

the essential structure of the problem in the most general case can be captured

radiative transfer to depict the escape of particles. We found that the tidal
forces supply significant accelerations and result in anisotropic winds. An
important effect of the tidal forces is that it severely depresses the outflow
of particles near the polar regions. As a consequence, most particles escape
the surface of the planet from the regions of low-latitude. Comparing the tidal
and non-tidal locking cases, we found that their optical depths are very
different so that the flows also emerge with a different pattern. In the case
of the non-tidal locking, the radial velocities at the base of the wind are
higher than the meridional velocities. However, in the case of tidal locking,
the meridional velocities dominate the flow at the base of the wind, and they
can transfer effectively mass and energy from the day sides to the night sides.
Further, we also found that the differences of the winds show middle extent at
large radii. It expresses that the structure of the wind at the base can be
changed by the two-dimensional radiative transfer due to large optical depths,
but the extent is reduced with an increase in radius. Because the escape is
depressed in the polar regions, the mass loss rate predicted by the non-tidal
locking model, in the order of magnitude of $10^{10}$ g s$^{-1}$, is a factor
of 2 lower than that predicted by one-dimensional hydrodynamic model. The
results of tidal locking show that the mass loss rate is decreased a order of
magnitude, only 4.3$\times$ $10^{9}$ g s$^{-1}$, due to large optical depths on
the night side. We also found that the distributions of hydrogen atoms show
clear variations from the day side to night side, thus the origin of the excess
absorption in Ly $\alpha$ should be reexamined by using multi-dimensional
hydrodynamic models.

show that the subpulse period (P3) is constant on timescales of days, months
and years, and between 14-5100 MHz. Despite this, the shapes of the driftbands
change radically with frequency. Previous studies have concluded that, while
the subpulses appear to move through the pulse window approximately linearly at
low frequencies (< 500 MHz), a discrete step of 180 degrees in subpulse phase
is observed at higher frequencies (> 820 MHz) near to the peak of the average
pulse profile. We use LOFAR, GMRT, GBT, WSRT and Effelsberg 100-m data to
explore the frequency-dependence of this phase step. We show that the size of
the subpulse phase step increases gradually, and is observable even at low
frequencies. We attribute the subpulse phase step to the presence of two
separate driftbands, whose relative arrival times vary with frequency - one
driftband arriving 30 pulses earlier at 20 MHz than it does at 1380 MHz, whilst
the other arrives simultaneously at all frequencies. The drifting pattern which
is observed here cannot be explained by either the rotating carousel model or
the surface oscillation model, and could provide new insight into the physical
processes happening within the pulsar magnetosphere.

attenuation, $\ < E_s (B-V) \ > \sim 0.20$. Due to their selection criterion,
LBGs at $z \sim 1$ are UV-bright galaxies and have high dust-corrected total
SFR, with a median value of 16.9 $M_\odot {\rm yr}^{-1}$. Their median stellar
mass is $\log{\left(M_*/M_\odot \right)} = 9.74$. We obtain that the
dust-corrected total SFR of LBGs increases with stellar mass and the specific
SFR is lower for more massive galaxies. Only 2% of the galaxies selected
through the Lyman break criterion have an AGN nature. LBGs at $z \sim 1$ are
mostly located over the blue cloud of the color-magnitude diagram of galaxies
at their redshift, with only the oldest and/or the dustiest deviating towards
the green valley and red sequence. Morphologically, 69% of LBGs are disk-like
galaxies, with the fraction of interacting, compact, or irregular systems being
much lower, below 12%. LBGs have a median effective radius of 2.5 kpc and
bigger galaxies have higher total SFR and stellar mass. Comparing to their
high-redshift analogues, we find evidence that LBGs at lower redshifts are
bigger, redder in the UV continuum, and have a major presence of older stellar
populations in their SEDs. However, we do not find significant difference in
the distributions of stellar mass or dust attenuation.

(OFDM) wiretap channels with Gaussian channel inputs has already been studied
in some previous works from an information theoretical viewpoint. However,
these results are not sufficient for practical system design. One reason is
that discrete channel inputs, such as quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)
signals, instead of Gaussian channel inputs, are deployed in current practical
wireless systems to maintain moderate peak transmission power and receiver
complexity. In this paper, we investigate the power allocation and artificial
noise design for OFDM wiretap channels with discrete channel inputs. We first
prove that the secrecy rate function for discrete channel inputs is nonconcave
with respect to the transmission power. To resolve the corresponding nonconvex
secrecy rate maximization problem, we develop a low-complexity power allocation
algorithm, which yields a duality gap diminishing in the order of
O(1/\sqrt{N}), where N is the number of subcarriers of OFDM. We then show that
independent frequency-domain artificial noise cannot improve the secrecy rate
of single-antenna wiretap channels. Towards this end, we propose a novel
time-domain artificial noise design which exploits temporal degrees of freedom
provided by the cyclic prefix of OFDM systems {to jam the eavesdropper and
boost the secrecy rate even with a single antenna at the transmitter}.
Numerical results are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed
design schemes.

MN$ linear measurements $y_1,..., y_n$ of $X_0$, where $y_i = \Tr(a_i^T X_0)$
and each $a_i$ is a $M$ by $N$ matrix. For measurement matrices with Gaussian
i.i.d entries, it known that if $X_0$ is of low rank, it is recoverable from
just a few measurements. A popular approach for matrix recovery is Nuclear Norm
Minimization (NNM). Empirical work reveals a \emph{phase transition} curve,
stated in terms of the undersampling fraction $\delta(n,M,N) = n/(MN)$, rank
fraction $\rho=r/N$ and aspect ratio $\beta=M/N$. Specifically, a curve
$\delta^* = \delta^*(\rho;\beta)$ exists such that, if $\delta >
\delta^*(\rho;\beta)$, NNM typically succeeds, while if $\delta <
\delta^*(\rho;\beta)$, it typically fails. An apparently quite different
problem is matrix denoising in Gaussian noise, where an unknown $M$ by $N$
matrix $X_0$ is to be estimated based on direct noisy measurements $Y = X_0 +
Z$, where the matrix $Z$ has iid Gaussian entries. It has been empirically
observed that, if $X_0$ has low rank, it may be recovered quite accurately from
the noisy measurement $Y$. A popular matrix denoising scheme solves the
unconstrained optimization problem $\text{min} \| Y - X \|_F^2/2 + \lambda
\|X\|_* $. When optimally tuned, this scheme achieves the asymptotic minimax
MSE $\cM(\rho) = \lim_{N \goto \infty} \inf_\lambda \sup_{\rank(X) \leq \rho
\cdot N} MSE(X,\hat{X}_\lambda)$. We report extensive experiments showing that
the phase transition $\delta^*(\rho)$ in the first problem coincides with the
minimax risk curve $\cM(\rho)$ in the second problem, for {\em any} rank
fraction $0 < \rho < 1$.

conclude that the measured length data uniquely determines the associated

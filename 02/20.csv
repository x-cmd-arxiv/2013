  authors",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes an approximate method, equivalent access intensity (EAI),
for the throughput analysis of CSMA wireless networks in which links have
finite offered-load and their MAC-layer transmit buffers may be empty from time
to time. Different from prior works that mainly considered the saturated
network, we take into account in our analysis the impacts of empty transmit
buffers on the interactions and dependencies among links in the network that is
more common in practice. It is known that the empty transmit buffer incurs
extra waiting time for a link to compete for the channel airtime usage, since
when it has no packet waiting for transmission, the link will not perform
channel competition. The basic idea behind EAI is that this extra waiting time
can be mapped to an equivalent ""longer"" backoff countdown time for the
unsaturated link, yielding a lower link access intensity that is defined as the
mean packet transmission time divided by the mean backoff countdown time. That
is, we can compute the ""equivalent access intensity"" of an unsaturated link to
incorporate the effects of the empty transmit buffer on its behavior of channel
competition. Then, prior saturated ideal CSMA network (ICN) model can be
adopted for link throughput computation. Specifically, we propose an iterative
algorithm, ""Compute-and-Compare"", to identify which links are unsaturated under
current offered-load and protocol settings, compute their ""equivalent access
intensities"" and calculate link throughputs. Simulation shows that our
algorithm has high accuracy under various offered-load and protocol settings.
We believe the ability to identify unsaturated links and compute links
throughputs as established in this paper will serve an important first step
toward the design and optimization of general CSMA wireless networks with
offered-load control.

and irreversibility on the dynamical properties of spin systems. We consider
the ferromagnetic spherical model with asymmetric linear Langevin dynamics.
Such an asymmetric dynamics is irreversible, i.e., breaks detailed balance,
because the principle of action and reaction is violated. The
fluctuation-dissipation theorem therefore no longer holds. The stationary state
is however still Gibbsian, i.e., the weights of configurations are given by the
Boltzmann factor corresponding to the ferromagnetic Hamiltonian. The model is
exactly solvable in any dimension, enabling an analytical evaluation of
time-dependent observables. We show the existence of two regimes of violation
of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem in the nonequilibrium stationary state:
a regime of weak violation where the stationary fluctuation-dissipation ratio
is finite but less than unity and varies continuously with the asymmetry, and a
regime of strong violation where the fluctuation-dissipation ratio vanishes
asymptotically. This phenomenon was first uncovered in the asymmetric kinetic
Ising chain. The present results suggest that this novel kind of dynamical
transition in nonequilibrium stationary states might be quite general. We also
perform a systematic analysis of several regimes of interest, either stationary
or transient, in various dimensions and in the different phases of the model.

from two XMM-Newton observations to search for pulsations, characterise the
spectrum, and measure spectral and timing changes. Long-term X-ray variability
was studied using archival ROSAT data. The XMM positions were used to identify
the optical counterpart. We obtained UV to NIR photometry to characterise the
companion, along with its 4000 d long I-band light curve. We observed LXP169
with Swift at two predicted eclipse times. We found a spin period of 168.8 s
that did not change between two XMM observations. The X-ray spectrum, well
characterised by a power law, was harder when the source was brighter. The
X-ray flux of LXP169 is found to be variable by a factor of at least 10. The
counterpart is highly variable on short and long timescales, and its photometry
is that of an early-type star with a NIR excess. This classifies the source as
a BeXRB pulsar. We observed a transit in the UV, thereby confirming that the
companion star itself is eclipsed. We give an ephemeris for the transit of MJD
56203.877 + N*24.329. We propose and discuss the scenario where the matter
captured from the companion's equatorial disc creates an extended region of
high density around the neutron star (NS), which partially eclipses the
companion as the NS transits in front of it. This is most likely the first time
the compact object in an XRB is observed to eclipse its companion star. LXP169
would be the first eclipsing BeXRB, and a wealth of important information might
be gained from additional observations, such as a measure of the possible Be
disc/orbital plane misalignment, or the mass of the NS.

What we learn and how we learn it has important implications for effective

broader context of the problem. Through a meta-analysis and an experimental
assessment of the top algorithms on popular data sets, we gain a sense of how
often metric properties are violated by good recognition algorithms. By

ATCA observations at 20 cm that resulted in sensitive images with an angular
resolution of 10 arcsec. The fractional polarization in the two bright radio
and X-ray lobes of the SNR is measured to be 0.17, while in the southeastern
sector, where the radio and non-thermal X-ray emission are much weaker, the
polarization fraction reaches a value of 0.6 +- 0.2, close to the theoretical
limit of 0.7. We interpret this result as evidence of a disordered, turbulent
magnetic field in the lobes, where particle acceleration is believed to be
efficient, and a highly ordered field in the southeast, where the acceleration
efficiency has been shown to be very low. Utilizing the frequency coverage of
our observations, an average rotation measure of ~12 rad/m2 is determined from
the combined data set, which is then used to obtain the intrinsic direction of
the magnetic field vectors. While the orientation of magnetic field vectors
across the SNR shell appear radial, a large fraction of the magnetic vectors
lie parallel to the Galactic Plane. Along the highly polarized southeastern
rim, the field is aligned tangent to the shock, and therefore also nearly
parallel to the Galactic Plane. These results strongly suggest that the ambient
field surrounding SN 1006 is aligned with this direction (i.e., from northeast
to southwest) and that the bright lobes are due to a polar cap geometry. Our
study establishes that the most efficient particle acceleration and generation
of magnetic turbulence in SN 1006 is attained for shocks in which the magnetic
field direction and shock normal are quasi-parallel, while inefficient
acceleration and little to no generation of magnetic turbulence obtains for the
quasi-perpendicular case.

displacement and defocusing effects. SAR imagery also contains significant
sources of non-stationary spatially-varying noises, including antenna gain
discrepancies, angular scintillation (glints) and complex speckle. In order to
account for this intricate phenomenology, this work combines the knowledge of
the physical, kinematic, and statistical properties of SAR imaging into a
single unified Bayesian structure that simultaneously (a) estimates the
nuisance parameters such as clutter distributions and antenna miscalibrations
and (b) estimates the target signature required for detection/inference of the
target state. Moreover, we provide a Monte Carlo estimate of the posterior
distribution for the target state and nuisance parameters that infers the

demonstrates that the proposed algorithm is robust at detecting/estimating

prediction of the presence of two diametrally opposed, co-rotating blobs of
gas. A phase lag of -0.085 was detected between the polarization minimum and
the primary minimum of the light curve, suggestive of a complex shape of the
plasma clouds. We present a preliminary analysis of the data with the Rigidly

quantum flux, known as fractional vortices. In the ground state, the fractional

stabilized in multiband superconductors with a periodic pinning array at the
half matching field of the composite system, when full matching of the
fractionalized vortices occurs. In the presence of a high current, the
fractional vortices in different bands decouple and move at different
velocities. When the current is turned off suddenly, the fractional vortices in
different bands may be trapped at different pinning sites. This system also
exhibits rich dynamic behavior, and for fractional vortices in two-band
superconductors we find a phases where the vortices one band are pinned and the
vortices in the other band are moving. These different phases can be observed
in transport measurements, and produce a new type of self-induced Shapiro steps

use of a risk model which has been annotated with potential countermeasures,

imaging of transcripts and proteins is the gold-standard, but it is difficult
and time consuming to apply to an entire genome, even when highly automated.
Sequencing, in contrast, is fast and genome-wide, but is generally applied to
homogenized tissues, thereby discarding spatial information. It is likely that
these methods will ultimately converge, and we will be able to sequence RNAs in
situ, simultaneously determining their identity and location. As a step along
this path, we developed methods to cryosection individual blastoderm stage
Drosophila melanogaster embryos along the anterior-posterior axis and sequence
the mRNA isolated from each 25 micron slice. The spatial patterns of gene
expression we infer closely match patterns previously determined by in situ
hybridization and microscopy. We applied this method to generate a genome-wide
timecourse of spatial gene expression from shortly after fertilization through
gastrulation. We identify numerous genes with spatial patterns that have not
yet been described in the several ongoing systematic in situ based projects.
This simple experiment demonstrates the potential for combining careful
anatomical dissection with high-throughput sequencing to obtain spatially

lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO-LUMO gaps) in protein systems and
water clusters is presented. Recent work questioning the applicability of
Kohn-Sham density-functional theory to proteins and large water clusters (E.
Rudberg, J. Phys.: Condens. Mat. 2012, 24, 072202) has demonstrated vanishing
HOMO-LUMO gaps for these systems, which is generally attributed to the
treatment of exchange in the functional used. The present work shows that the
vanishing gap is, in fact, an electrostatic artefact of the method used to
prepare the system. Practical solutions for ensuring the gap is maintained when
the system size is increased are demonstrated. This work has important
implications for the use of large-scale density-functional theory in
biomolecular systems, particularly in the simulation of photoemission, optical
absorption and electronic transport, all of which depend critically on
differences between energies of molecular orbitals.

by a non-renewable resource are used for supplying the energy required for
system operation. We first consider a deterministic offline system setting. In
particular, assuming availability of non-causal knowledge about energy arrivals
and channel gains, an offline resource allocation problem is formulated as a
non-convex optimization problem taking into account the circuit energy
consumption, a finite energy storage capacity, and a minimum required data
rate. We transform this non-convex optimization problem into a convex
optimization problem by applying time-sharing and fractional programming which
results in an efficient asymptotically optimal offline iterative resource
allocation algorithm. In each iteration, the transformed problem is solved by
using Lagrange dual decomposition. The obtained resource allocation policy
maximizes the weighted energy efficiency of data transmission. Subsequently, we
focus on online algorithm design. A stochastic dynamic programming approach is
employed to obtain the optimal online resource allocation algorithm which
requires a prohibitively high complexity. To strike a balance between system
performance and computational complexity, we propose a low complexity
suboptimal online iterative algorithm which is motivated by the offline
optimization.

spatially unresolved in the catalog. If these sources are fast-spinning pulsars
(e.g. sub-millisecond pulsars), previous large-scale pulsar surveys may have
missed detection due to instrumental and computational limitations, eclipsing

pulsar would significantly constrain the neutron star equation of state and
would have implications for models predicting a rapid slowdown of highly
recycled X-ray pulsars to millisecond periods from, e.g., accretion disk
decoupling. These same sources were previously searched unsuccessfully for
pulsations at 610 MHz with the Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank. This new
search was conducted at a different epoch with a new 800 MHz backend on the
NRAO 43-meter Telescope at a center frequency of 1200 MHz. Our search was
sensitive to sub-millisecond pulsars in highly accelerated binary systems and
to short transient pulses. No periodic or transient signals were detected from
any of the target sources. We conclude that diffractive scintillation,
dispersive smearing, and binary acceleration are unlikely to have prevented
detection of the large majority of the sources if they are pulsars, though we
cannot rule out eclipsing, nulling or intermittent emission, or radio
interference as possible factors for some non-detections. Other (speculative)
possibilities for what these sources might be include radio-emitting magnetic
cataclysmic variables or older pulsars with aligned magnetic and spin axes.

velocities, spectral types, vsini values, and flux ratios for the components in
these systems resulting from two-dimensional cross-correlation analysis. These
results are based on high-resolution, near-infrared spectroscopy taken with the
Keck II telescope to provide a first characterization of these systems as
double-lined rather than single-lined. It applies the power of infrared
spectroscopy to the detection of cool secondaries; the flux scales as a less
steep function of mass in the infrared than in the visible, thus enabling an
identification of low-mass secondaries. We found that the RX J0513.1+0851 and
RX J0539.9+0956 primary stars are fast rotators, 60 km/s and 80 km/s
respectively; this introduces extra difficulty in the detection of the
secondary component as a result of the quite broad absorption lines. To date,
these are the highest rotational velocities measured for a pre-main sequence
spectroscopic binary. The orbital parameters and mass ratios were determined by
combining new visible light spectroscopy with our infrared data for both

of compressible isothermal fluid permeated by a horizontal magnetic field of
strength decreasing with height. Dissipation of momentum and magnetic field is
neglected. By the use of a Rayleigh-Schr\""odinger perturbation analysis, we
explain in detail the limit in which the transverse horizontal wavenumber of
the perturbation, denoted by $k$, is large (i.e.\ short horizontal wavelength)

vertical direction as $k$ is increased. The growth rates are determined by a
function of the vertical coordinate $z$ since, in the large $k$ limit, the
eigenmodes are strongly localized in the vertical direction. We consider in
detail the case of two-dimensional perturbations varying in the directions
perpendicular to the magnetic field, which, for sufficiently strong field
gradients, are the most unstable. The results of our analysis are backed up by
comparison with a series of initial value problems. Finally we extend the

dislocations in crystals, as vortices and solitons in superfluids and
superconductors, and generally in the wake of symmetry-breaking phase
transitions. In fermionic systems, topological defects may provide bound states
for fermions that often play a crucial role for the system's transport
properties. Famous examples are Andreev bound states inside vortex cores,
fractionally charged solitons in relativistic quantum field theory, and the
spinless charged solitons responsible for the high conductivity of polymers.
However, the free motion of topological defects in electronic systems is
hindered by pinning at impurities. Here we create long-lived solitons in a
strongly interacting fermionic superfluid by imprinting a phase step into the
superfluid wavefunction, and directly observe their oscillatory motion in the
trapped superfluid. As the interactions are tuned from the regime of
Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of tightly bound molecules towards the
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) limit of long-range Cooper pairs, the effective
mass of the solitons increases dramatically to more than 200 times their bare
mass. This signals their filling with Andreev states and strong quantum
fluctuations. For the unitary Fermi gas, the mass enhancement is more than
fifty times larger than expectations from mean-field Bogoliubov-de Gennes
theory. Our work paves the way towards the experimental study and control of
Andreev bound states in ultracold atomic gases. In the presence of spin
imbalance, the solitons created here represent one limit of the long
sought-after Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state of mobile Cooper
pairs.

we extend these results to whole-plane \SLE_\kappa(\rho) and establish
continuity and transience of these paths. In particular, we extend ordinary
whole-plane SLE reversibility (established by Zhan for \kappa \in [0,4]) to all
\kappa \in [0,8].
  We also show that the rays of a given angle (with variable starting point)
form a space-filling planar tree. Each branch is a form of SLE_\kappa for some
\kappa \in (0, 4), and the curve that traces the tree in the natural order
(hitting x before y if the branch from x is left of the branch from y) is a
space-filling form of \SLE_{\kappa'} where \kappa':= 16/\kappa \in (4, \infty).
By varying the boundary data we obtain, for each \kappa'>4, a family of
space-filling variants of \SLE_{\kappa'}(\rho) whose time reversals belong to
the same family. When \kappa' \geq 8, ordinary \SLE_{\kappa'} belongs to this
family, and our result shows that its time-reversal is \SLE_{\kappa'}(\kappa'/2

probing the geometry of magnetic fields in circumstellar disks. Single dish
observations and theoretical work have hinted that magnetic field geometries
might be predominantly toroidal, and that disks should exhibit millimeter
polarization fractions of 2-3%. While subsequent work has not confirmed these
high polarization fractions, either the wavelength of observation or the target
sources differed from the original observations. Here we present new
polarimetric observations of three nearby circumstellar disks at 2"" resolution
with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) and the Combined Array for Research in
Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA). We reobserve GM Aur and DG Tau, the systems in
which millimeter polarization detections have been claimed. Despite higher
resolution and sensitivity at wavelengths similar to the previous observations,
the new observations do not show significant polarization. We also add
observations of a new HAeBe system, MWC 480. These observations demonstrate
that a very low (<0.5%) polarization fraction is probably common at large (>100
AU) scales in bright circumstellar disks. We suggest that high-resolution
observations may be worthwhile to probe magnetic field structure on linear
distances smaller than the disk scale height, as well as in regions closer to
the star that may have larger MRI-induced magnetic field strengths.

  Low-metallicity star-forming dwarf galaxies are prime targets to understand
the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium. The HI region provides
important constraints on the dispersal and mixing of heavy elements released by
successive star-formation episodes. Our primary objective is to study the
enrichment of the HI region and the interplay between star-formation history
and metallicity evolution.
  We observed the most metal-poor star-forming galaxy in the Local Universe, I
Zw 18, with Hubble/COS. The abundances in the neutral gas are derived from
far-UV absorption-lines (HI, CII, CII*, NI, OI, ...) and are compared to the
abundances in the HII region. Models are constructed to calculate the
ionization structure and the thermal processes. We investigate the gas cooling
in the HI region through physical diagnostics drawn from the fine-structure
level of C+.
  We find that HI region abundances are lower by a factor of ~2 as compared to
the HII region. There is no differential depletion on dust between the HI and
HII region. Using sulfur as a metallicity tracer, we calculate a metallicity of
1/46 solar (vs. 1/31 in the HII region). From the study of abundance ratios, we
propose that C, N, O, and Fe are mainly produced in massive stars. We argue
that the HI envelope may contain pockets of pristine gas with a metallicity
essentially null. Finally, we derive the physical conditions in the HI region
by investigating the CII* absorption line. The cooling rate derived from CII*
is consistent with collisions with H atoms in the diffuse neutral gas. We
calculate the star-formation rate from the CII* cooling rate assuming that
photoelectric effect on dust is the dominant gas heating mechanism. Our
determination is in good agreement with the values in the literature if we
assume a low dust-to-gas ratio (~2000 times lower than the Milky Way value).

pairing in iron-based high temperature superconductors shows a structure which
is a linear combination of planar s-wave and d-wave symmetry channels, both
preserving the 3-dimensional A_1g irreducible representation of the
corresponding crystal point-group. We demonstrate that the s- and d-wave
channels are determined by the parity under reflection of the electronic
orbitals through the iron planes, and by improper rotations around the iron
sites. We provide evidence of these general properties by performing accurate
quantum Monte Carlo ab-initio calculations of the pairing function, for a FeSe
lattice with tetragonal experimental geometry at ambient pressure. We find that
this picture survives even in the FeSe under pressure and at low temperatures,
when the tetragonal point-group symmetry is slightly broken. In order to
achieve a higher resolution in momentum space we introduce a BCS model that
faithfully describes our QMC variational pairing function on the simulated 4x4
FeSe unit cell. This allows us to provide a k-resolved image of the pairing
function, and show that non-isotropic contributions in the BCS gap function are
related to the improper s-wave symmetry. Our theory can rationalize and explain
a series of contradictory experimental findings, such as the observation of
twofold symmetry in the FeSe superconducting phase, the anomalous drop of T_c
with Co-impurity in LaFeAsO_(1-x)F_x, the s-to-d-wave gap transition in

the magnetic resonance mode found in various unconventional superconductors. If
the pairing symmetry is $s_{\pm}$, a dynamical coupling between the orbital
ordering and the d-wave subdominant pairing channels is present by symmetry.
Therefore the nature of the resonance mode depends on the relative strengths of
the fluctuations in these two channels, which could vary significantly for
different families of the iron based superconductors. The application of our

of imperfect CSI on the performance of CARA is our main concern. Specifically,
an exact stability analysis is carried out when a pair of bursty sources are
competing for a common receiver and, thereby, have interdependent services. The
analysis also takes into account the compound effects of the multipacket
reception (MPR) capability at the receiver. The contributions in this paper are
twofold: first, we obtain the exact stability region of CARA in the presence of
channel estimation errors; such an assessment is necessary as the errors in
channel estimation are inevitable in the practical situation. Secondly, we
compare the performance of CARA to that achieved by the class of stationary
scheduling policies that make decisions in a centralized manner based on the
CSI feedback. It is shown that the stability region of CARA is not necessarily
a subset of that of centralized schedulers as the MPR capability improves.

under the well-studied consensus algorithms for known linear systems. For this
purpose, we propose a novel stability tool based on a generalized comparison
lemma. With the aid of the novel stability tool, it is shown that the proposed
nonlinear consensus algorithm can guarantee finite-time convergence if the
directed switching interaction graph has a directed spanning tree at each time
interval. Specifically, the finite-time convergence is shown by comparing the
closed-loop system under the proposed consensus algorithm with some
well-designed closed-loop system whose stability properties are easier to

closed-loop system using the proposed consensus algorithm under a (general)

and the finite-time convergence of some special well-designed nonlinear
closed-loop system under some special directed switching interaction graph,
where each agent has at most one neighbor whose state is either the maximum of
those states that are smaller than its own state or the minimum of those states
that are larger than its own state. This provides a stimulating example for the
potential applications of the proposed novel stability tool in the stability

uniaxial anisotropy and in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. Two
magnetic ions are connected to each other through a third, nonmagnetic ion. The
magnetic ions are coupled to ideal metallic leads and a back gate voltage is
applied to the molecule, forming a field-effect transistor. The microscopic
Hamiltonian describing this system includes inter-ion hopping, on-site
repulsions, and magnetic anisotropies. For a range of values of the parameters
of the Hamiltonian, we obtain an energy spectrum similar to that of
single-molecule magnets in the giant-spin approximation where the two states
with maximum spin projection along the uniaxial anisotropy axis are well
separated from other states. In addition, upon applying an external in-plane
magnetic field, the energy gap between the ground and first excited states of
the molecule oscillates, going to zero at certain special values of the field,
in analogy to the diabolical points resulting from Berry phase interference in
the giant spin model. Thus, our microscopic model provides the same
phenomenological behavior expected from the giant spin model of a
single-molecule magnet but with direct access to the internal structure of the
molecule, thus making it more appropriate for realistic electronic transport
studies. To illustrate this point, the nonlinear electronic transport in the
sequential tunneling regime is evaluated for values of the field near these
degeneracy points. We show that the existence of these points has a clear
signature in the I-V characteristics of the molecule, most notably the
modulation of excitation lines in the differential conductance.

Submitted to PRD",,"10.1103/PhysRevD.87.075011",,"hep-ph astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many particle physics models attempt to explain the 130 GeV gamma-ray feature
that the Fermi-LAT observes in the Galactic Center. Neutralino dark matter in
non-minimal supersymmetric models, such as the NMSSM, is an especially
well-motivated theoretical setup which can explain the line. We explore the
possibility that regions of the NMSSM consistent with the 130 GeV line can also
produce the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe via electroweak
baryogenesis. We find that such regions can in fact accommodate a strongly
first-order electroweak phase transition (due to the singlet contribution to
the effective potential), while also avoiding a light stop and producing a
Standard Model-like Higgs in the observed mass range. Simultaneously,
CP-violation from a complex phase in the wino-higgsino sector can account for
the observed baryon asymmetry through resonant sources at the electroweak phase
transition, while satisfying current constraints from dark matter, collider,
and electric dipole moment (EDM) experiments. This result is possible by virtue
of a relatively light pseudoscalar Higgs sector with a small degree of mixing,
which yields efficient s-channel resonant neutralino annihilation consistent
with indirect detection constraints, and of the moderate values of $\mu$
required to obtain a bino-like LSP consistent with the line. The wino mass is
essentially a free parameter which one can tune to satisfy electroweak
baryogenesis. Thus, the NMSSM framework can potentially explain the origins of
both baryonic and dark matter components in the Universe. The tightness of the
constraints we impose on this scenario makes it extraordinarily predictive, and
conclusively testable in the near future by modest improvements in EDM and dark
matter search experiments.

coexistence between the two tiers at physical layer. We target our efforts on a
long term evolution advanced (LTE-A) orthogonal frequency division multiple
access (OFDMA) macro-cell sharing the spectrum with a randomly deployed second
tier of small-cells. In such networks, high levels of co-channel interference
between the macro and small base stations (MBS/SBS) may largely limit the
potential spectral efficiency gains provided by the frequency reuse 1. To
address this issue, we propose a novel cognitive interference alignment based
scheme to protect the macro-cell from the cross-tier interference, while
mitigating the co-tier interference in the second tier. Remarkably, only local
channel state information (CSI) and autonomous operations are required in the
second tier, resulting in a completely self-organizing approach for the SBSs.
The optimal precoder that maximizes the spectral efficiency of the link between
each SBS and its served user equipment is found by means of a distributed
one-shot strategy. Numerical findings reveal non-negligible spectral efficiency
enhancements with respect to traditional time division multiple access
approaches at any signal to noise (SNR) regime. Additionally, the proposed
technique exhibits significant robustness to channel estimation errors,
achieving remarkable results for the imperfect CSI case and yielding consistent

(macro-cell and cognitive small-cells) network, under the complete spectrum
sharing paradigm, is studied. A new orthogonal precoder transmit scheme for the
small base stations, called multi-user Vandermonde-subspace frequency division
multiplexing (MU-VFDM), is proposed. MU-VFDM allows several cognitive small
base stations to coexist with legacy macro-cell receivers, by nulling the
small- to macro-cell cross-tier interference, without any cooperation between
the two tiers. This cleverly designed cascaded precoder structure, not only
cancels the cross-tier interference, but avoids the co-tier interference for
the small-cell network. The achievable sum-rate of the small-cell network,
satisfying the interference cancelation requirements, is evaluated for perfect
and imperfect channel state information at the transmitter. Simulation results
for the cascaded MU-VFDM precoder show a comparable performance to that of
state-of-the-art dirty paper coding technique, for the case of a dense cellular
layout. Finally, a comparison between MU-VFDM and a standard complete spectrum
separation strategy is proposed. Promising gains in terms of achievable
sum-rate are shown for the two-tiered network w.r.t. the traditional bandwidth
management approach.

designing efficient circuits and devices for RF energy harvesting suitable for
low-power wireless applications. Motivated by this and building upon the
classic cognitive radio (CR) network model, this paper proposes a novel method
for wireless networks coexisting where low-power mobiles in a secondary
network, called secondary transmitters (STs), harvest ambient RF energy from
transmissions by nearby active transmitters in a primary network, called
primary transmitters (PTs), while opportunistically accessing the spectrum
licensed to the primary network. We consider a stochastic-geometry model in
which PTs and STs are distributed as independent homogeneous Poisson point
processes (HPPPs) and communicate with their intended receivers at fixed
distances. Each PT is associated with a guard zone to protect its intended
receiver from ST's interference, and at the same time delivers RF energy to STs
located in its harvesting zone. Based on the proposed model, we analyze the
transmission probability of STs and the resulting spatial throughput of the
secondary network. The optimal transmission power and density of STs are
derived for maximizing the secondary network throughput under the given
outage-probability constraints in the two coexisting networks, which reveal key
insights to the optimal network design. Finally, we show that our analytical
result can be generally applied to a non-CR setup, where distributed wireless
power chargers are deployed to power coexisting wireless transmitters in a

the SQRL Pacemaker Formal Methods Challenge we demonstrate our framework by
building a formal model for the cardiac pacemaker in SPIN, checking for
desirable temporal properties of the model (expressed as LTL formulas),
generating C code from the model (by refinement of PROMELA) and validating the
generated implementation (using SPIN). We argue that a state of the art model
checking tool like SPIN can be used to do formal specification as well as
validation of the implementation. To evaluate our approach we show that our
pacemaker model is expressive enough to derive consistent operating modes and
that the refinement rules preserve LTL properties.

evolution of magnetic correlations from ferromagnetic- to antiferromagnetic-
gives rise to topological phase transitions, where the paramagnetic topological
insulator of Bi2Te3 turns into a band insulator with ferromagnetic-cluster
glassy behaviours around x ~ 0.025, and it further evolves to a topological
insulator with valence-bond glassy behaviours, which spans over the region
between x ~ 0.03 up to x ~ 0.1. This phase diagram is verified by measuring
magnetization, magnetotransport, and angle-resolved photoemission spectra with
theoretical discussions.

verification Protocol (COP) that ensures linearizability when the server is
correct and preserves fork-linearizability in any other case. All clients that
observe each other's operations are consistent, in the sense that their own
operations and those operations of other clients that they see are
linearizable. If the server forks two clients by hiding an operation, these
clients never again see operations of each other. COP supports wait-free client
operations in the sense that when executed with a correct server,
non-conflicting operations can run without waiting for other clients, allowing
more parallelism than earlier protocols. A conflict arises when an operation
causes a subsequent operation to produce a different output value for the
client who runs it. The paper gives a precise model for the guarantees of COP
and includes a formal analysis that these are achieved.

given as the functional derivative of the Coulomb energy with respect to the
density, where the Coulomb energy is calculated explicitly in terms of the pair
density of the Kohn-Sham orbitals. This is accomplished by taking advantage of
an orthonormal and complete basis that is an explicit functional of the density
that then allows for the functional differentiation of the pair density with
respect to the density to be performed explicitly. This approach leads to a new
formalism that provides an analytic, closed-form determination of the exchange
potential. This method is applied to one-dimensional model systems and to the
atoms Helium through Krypton based on an exchange only implementation.
Comparison of our total energies (denoted SIF) to those obtained using the

Clear evidence for an electron-phonon mechanism in conventional superconductors
is seen by the isotope effect on the superconducting transition temperatures
$T_{\rm SC}$, since isotopic substitution varies the phonon frequency without
affecting the electronic states. In unconventional superconductors, magnetic
fluctuations have been proposed to mediate superconductivity, and considerable
efforts have been made to unravel relationships between normal-state magnetic
fluctuations and superconductivity. Here, we show that characteristic
experimental results on the ferromagnetic (FM) superconductor UCoGe ($T_{\rm
Curie} \sim 2.5 $ K and $T_{\rm SC} \sim 0.6$ K) can be understood consistently
within a scenario of the spin-triplet superconductivity induced by FM spin
fluctuations. Temperature and angle dependencies of the upper critical magnetic
field of the superconductivity ($H_{c2}$) are calculated on the basis of the
above scenario by solving the Eliashberg equation. Calculated $H_{c2}$ well
agrees with the characteristic experimental results observed in UCoGe. This is

IR-improved soft-wall AdS/QCD model. The Reissner-Nordstrom AdS black hole
metric is introduced to describe both the finite temperature and density
effects. The thermal spectral function is computed, which shows that the
position of peak moves towards a smaller value and the width of peak also
broadens to a larger value as the temperature increases. The critical
temperature at which the peaks are completely dissolved has been found to be
around $T_{c}\simeq 160\sim 200\MeV$. The effect of chemical potential is shown
to be the same as the one caused by the temperature. It is found that when the
temperature approaches to zero $T\approx 0$, the melting down of mesons occurs
at the scaled critical chemical potential $\mu_0/\kappa\approx 2.2\sim 2.4
\GeV$.

detailed infrared data for extragalactic objects were first obtained. On the
scales of entire galaxies, a smaller PAH abundance in lower-metallicity
galaxies is often observed. We study this relationship for star-forming regions
in nearby galaxies, for a sample containing more than 200 HII complexes, using
spatially-resolved observations from the Herschel Space Observatory and Spitzer
Space Telescope. We use a model for the dust emission to estimate the physical
parameters (PAH abundance, metallicity, ultraviolet radiation field, etc.) of
these complexes. The same correlation of PAH abundance with metallicity, as
seen for entire galaxies, is apparently preserved at smaller scales, at least
when the Kobulnicky & Kewley metallicity calibration is used. We discuss
possible reasons for this correlation, noting that traces of less-effective PAH
formation in low-metallicity AGB stars should be smeared out by radial mixing
in galactic disks. Effective destruction by the harder and more intensive
ultraviolet field in low-metallicity environments is qualitatively consistent
with our data, as the ultraviolet field intensity, derived from the infrared
photometry, is indeed smaller in HII complexes with lower metallicity.

use echo-based strategies. We present a thorough analysis on how two adiabatic
rapid passages (ARP) are able to rephase atomic coherences in an
inhomogeneously broadened ensemble. We consider both the cases of optical and
spin coherences, rephased by optical or radio-frequency (rf) ARPs,
respectively. We show how a rephasing sequence consisting of two ARPs in a
double-echo scheme is equivalent to the identity operator (any state can be
recovered), as long as certain conditions are fulfilled. Our mathematical
treatment of the ARPs leads to a very simple geometrical interpretation within
the Bloch sphere that permits a visual comprehension of the rephasing process.
We also identify the conditions that ensure the rephasing, finding that the
phase of the optical or rf ARP fields plays a key role in the capability of the
sequence to preserve the phase of the superposition state. This settles a
difference between optical and rf ARPs, since field phase control is not
readily guaranteed in the former case. We also provide a quantitative
comparison between $\pi$-pulse and ARP rephasing efficiencies, showing the
superiority of the latter. We experimentally verify the conclusions of our
analysis through rf ARP rephasing sequencies performed on the rare-earth

of X-ray diffraction peak intensity in a crystal irradiated by highly intense
femtosecond pulses of an XFEL is investigated theoretically on the basis of
rate equations for bound electrons and the Boltzmann equation for the kinetics
of the unbound electron gas that plays an essential role in the time evolution
of the electron density of a crystal. The photoionization, Auger process,
electron-impact ionization, electron--electron scattering, and three-body
recombination have been implemented in the system of rate equations. An
algorithm for the numerical solution of the rate equations was simplified by
incorporating analytical expressions for the cross sections of all the electron
configurations in ions within the framework of the effective charge model.
Using this approach we evaluate the time dependence of the inner shell
population and electronic kinetic energy during the time of XFEL pulse
propagation through the crystal for photon energies between 3 and 12 keV and a
pulse width of 40 fs considering a flux of 10^12 ph/pulse (focusing on a spot
size of ~ 1 mum^2, this flux corresponds to a fluence ranging between 0.6 and
1.6 mJ/mum^2). The time evolution of the atomic scattering factor and its
fluctuation is numerically analyzed for the case of a Silicon crystal taking
into account the decrease of the bound electron density during the pulse

to demonstrate that a statistical iterative method classically applied to the
image deconvolution problem is very effective when utilized for the analysis of
count modulation profiles in solar hard X-ray imaging based on Rotating
Modulation Collimators. The algorithm described in this paper solves the
maximum likelihood problem iteratively and encoding a positivity constraint
into the iterative optimization scheme. The result is therefore a classical
Expectation Maximization method this time applied not to an image deconvolution
problem but to image reconstruction from count modulation profiles. The
technical reason that makes our implementation particularly effective in this
application is the use of a very reliable stopping rule which is able to
regularize the solution providing, at the same time, a very satisfactory
Cash-statistic (C-statistic). The method is applied to both reproduce synthetic
flaring configurations and reconstruct images from experimental data
corresponding to three real events. In this second case, the performance of
Expectation Maximization, when compared to Pixon image reconstruction, shows a
comparable accuracy and a notably reduced computational burden; when compared
to CLEAN, shows a better fidelity with respect to the measurements with a
comparable computational effectiveness. If optimally stopped, Expectation
Maximization represents a very reliable method for image reconstruction in the
RHESSI context when count modulation profiles are used as input data.

Optical Pumping (MEOP), 3He can be used as a contrast agent for lung magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI). MEOP is usually performed at low magnetic field (~ 1
mT) and low pressure (~ 1 mbar), which results in a low magnetization
production rate. A delicate polarization-preserving step of compression is also
required. It was demonstrated in sealed cells that high nuclear polarization
values can be obtained at higher pressures with MEOP, if performed at high
magnetic field (non-standard conditions). In this work the feasibility of
building a high-field polarizer that operates within a commercial 1.5 T scanner
was evaluated. Preliminary measurements of nuclear polarization with sealed
cells filled at different 3He gas pressures (1.33 to 267 mbar) were performed.
The use of an annular shape for the laser beam increased by 25 % the achievable
nuclear polarization equilibrium value (Meq) at 32 and 67 mbar as compared to a
Gaussian beam shape. Meq values of 66.4 and 31 % were obtained at 32 and 267
mbar respectively and the magnetization production rate was increased by a
factor of 10 compared to the best results obtained under standard conditions.
To study the reproducibility of the method in a polarizing system, the same
experiments were performed with small cells connected to a gas handling system.
The polarization build-up times were approximately 3 times longer in the 20-30
mbar range of pressure than those obtained for the 32 mbar sealed cell.
However, reasonable Meq values of 40-60 % were achieved in a 90 mL open cell.
Based on these findings, a novel compact polarizing system was designed and
built. Its typical output is a 3He gas flow rate of 15 sccm with a polarization
of 33 %. In-vivo lung MRI ventilation images were acquired to demonstrate the
polarizer s application.

many theories compete to describe the glass transition at thermal equilibrium,
very little is understood far from equilibrium. Here, we solve the dynamics of
a specific, yet representative, class of glass models in the presence of
nonthermal driving forces and energy dissipation, and show that a dynamic
arrest can take place in these nonequilibrium conditions. While the location of
the transition depends on the specifics of the driving mechanisms, important

model independent way by fixing observational bounds on the most relevant terms
of the $f(\mathcal T)$ Taylor expansion. We relate the $f(\mathcal T)$ models
and their derivatives to the cosmographic parameters and then adopt a Monte
Carlo analysis. The experimental bounds are thus independent of the choice of a
particular $f(\mathcal T)$ model. The advantage of such an analysis lies on
constraining the dynamics of the universe by reconstructing the form of
$f(\mathcal T)$, without any further assumptions apart from the validity of the
cosmological principle and the analyticity of the $f(\mathcal T)$ function. The
main result is to fix model independent cosmographic constraints on the
functional form of $f(\mathcal T)$ which are compatible with the theoretical
predictions. Furthermore, we infer a phenomenological expression for
$f(\mathcal T)$, compatible with the current cosmographic bounds and show that
small deviations are expected from a constant $f(\mathcal T)$ term, indicating
that the equation of state of dark energy could slightly evolve from the one of
the $\Lambda$CDM model.

It has been
widely studied in the last years with tools from physics, mathematics and
computer science. Here, a continuous model of opinion dynamics for multiple
possible choices is analysed. Its main features are the inclusion of
disagreement and possibility of modulating information, both from one and
multiple sources. The interest is in identifying the effect of the initial
cohesion of the population, the interplay between cohesion and information
extremism, and the effect of using multiple sources of information that can
influence the system. Final consensus, especially with external information,
depends highly on these factors, as numerical simulations show. When no
information is present, consensus or segregation is determined by the initial
cohesion of the population. Interestingly, when only one source of information
is present, consensus can be obtained, in general, only when this is extremely
mild, i.e. there is not a single opinion strongly promoted, or in the special
case of a large initial cohesion and low information exposure. On the contrary,
when multiple information sources are allowed, consensus can emerge with an
information source even when this is not extremely mild, i.e. it carries a
strong message, for a large range of initial conditions.

into the Lagrangian and then construct a Hamiltonian function according a usual
rule which is applied for systems without constraints. The main feature of
Hamiltonian dynamics in extended phase space is that it can be proved to be
completely equivalent to Lagrangian dynamics derived from the effective action.
We find a BRST invariant form of the effective action by adding terms not

according to the Noether theorem. Our algorithm differs from that by Batalin,
Fradkin and Vilkovisky, but the resulting BRST charge generates correct

much better then models with finite number of degrees of freedom, so that one

magnitude higher than prompt gamma-rays, making it special from most long GRBs.
We show that while the prompt gamma-ray emission satisfies the empirical
E_{iso}-E_{p} relation of typical long GRBs, the X-ray flares, whose spectra
can be fit with a cutoff-power-law model with well-constrained E_p,
significantly deviate from such a relation. Nonetheless, a time-resolved
spectral analysis of X-ray flares suggest that the X-ray emission is consistent
with the L_{iso}-E_{p} relation of long GRBs. We constrain the minimum Lorentz
factor of the X-ray flares to be ~14, which is consistent with the
Gamma-L_{iso} relation. Our results imply that prompt gamma-ray emission and
late X-ray flares share the similar radiation mechanism, but originate from the
outflows with different Lorentz factors. We search for similar GRBs from the
Swift GRB archives, and find that the z=6.29 GRB 050904 is a carbon copy of GRB

significant accretion at late times, which point towards a large-radius

communicate with each other by forming a multi-hop radio network and
maintaining connections in a decentralized manner. Security remains a major
challenge for these networks due to their features of open medium, dynamically
changing topologies, reliance on cooperative algorithms, absence of centralized
monitoring points, and lack of clear lines of defense. Protecting the network
layer of a MANET from malicious attacks is an important and challenging
security issue, since most of the routing protocols for MANETs are vulnerable
to various types of attacks. Ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing (AODV) is
a very popular routing algorithm. However, it is vulnerable to the well-known
black hole attack, where a malicious node falsely advertises good paths to a
destination node during the route discovery process but drops all packets in
the data forwarding phase. This attack becomes more severe when a group of
malicious nodes cooperate each other. The proposed mechanism does not apply any
cryptographic primitives on the routing messages. Instead, it protects the
network by detecting and reacting to malicious activities of the nodes.
Simulation results show that the scheme has a significantly high detection rate
with moderate network traffic overhead and computation overhead in the nodes.

  In this paper, we consider matrix completion formulations designed to hit a

called LR-BPDN that is able to exploit factorized formulations to solve the
corresponding optimization problem. Since practitioners typically have strong
prior knowledge about target error level, this innovation makes it easy to

collaborative filtering (CF) concept is data sparseness, i.e., limited user
preference data is available for making recommendations. Cross-domain
collaborative filtering (CDCF) has been studied as an effective mechanism to
alleviate data sparseness of one domain using the knowledge about user
preferences from other domains. A key question to be answered in the context of
CDCF is what common characteristics can be deployed to link different domains
for effective knowledge transfer. In this paper, we assess the usefulness of
user-contributed (social) tags in this respect. We do so by means of the
Generalized Tag-induced Cross-domain Collaborative Filtering (GTagCDCF)
approach that we propose in this paper and that we developed based on the
general collective matrix factorization framework. Assessment is done by a
series of experiments, using publicly available CF datasets that represent
three cross-domain cases, i.e., two two-domain cases and one three-domain case.
A comparative analysis on two-domain cases involving GTagCDCF and several
state-of-the-art CDCF approaches indicates the increased benefit of using
social tags as representatives of explicit links between domains for CDCF as
compared to the implicit links deployed by the existing CDCF methods. In
addition, we show that users from different domains can already benefit from
GTagCDCF if they only share a few common tags. Finally, we use the three-domain
case to validate the robustness of GTagCDCF with respect to the scale of
datasets and the varying number of domains.

can be reliably used in the calculation of the O-C diagram of TY CrA. By now,
the O-C diagram can be studied on a time basis of about two decades. We
confirm, that the O-C diagram cannot be explained by the spectroscopic
tertiary. For the first time, the light curve of the inner eclipsing binary is
analysed in both optical and near-IR bands simultaneously. In combination with
already published spectroscopic elements, precise absolute dimensions and
masses of the primary and the secondary component are obtained using the ROCHE

and a visual fourth component. The absolute parameters of the inner eclipsing
binary agree very well with previous work except of the primary radius

in COSMOS and GOODS (N+S), we examine the dust properties of IR-luminous
(L_IR>10^10 L_sun) galaxies at 0.1<z<2 and determine how these evolve with
cosmic time. The unique angle of this work is the rigorous analysis of survey
selection effects, making this the first study of the star-formation-dominated,
IR-luminous population within a framework almost entirely free of selection
biases. We find that IR-luminous galaxies have SEDs with broad far-IR peaks
characterised by cool/extended dust emission and average dust temperatures in
the 25-45K range. Hot (T>45K) SEDs and cold (T<25K), cirrus-dominated SEDs are
rare, with most sources being within the range occupied by warm starbursts such
as M82 and cool spirals such as M51. We observe a luminosity-temperature (L-T)
relation, where the average dust temperature of log[L_IR/L_sun]=12.5 galaxies
is about 10K higher than that of their log[L_IR/L_sun]=10.5 counterparts.
However, although the increased dust heating in more luminous systems is the
driving factor behind the L-T relation, the increase in dust mass and/or
starburst size with luminosity plays a dominant role in shaping it. Our results
show that the dust conditions in IR-luminous sources evolve with cosmic time:
at high redshift, dust temperatures are on average up to 10K lower than what is
measured locally. This is manifested as a flattening of the L-T relation,
suggesting that (U)LIRGs in the early Universe are typically characterised by a
more extended dust distribution and/or higher dust masses than local equivalent
sources. Interestingly, the evolution in dust temperature is luminosity
dependent, with the fraction of LIRGs with T<35K showing a 2-fold increase from
z~0 to z~2, whereas that of ULIRGs with T<35K shows a 6-fold increase.

associated with the spontaneous breaking of a global (superfluid case) or local
(superconductor case) U(1) symmetry in diverse dimensions d. By analyzing the
thermodynamics of the dilaton-gravity system we find that scale invariance is
broken at low temperatures, as shown by a nontrivial hyperscaling violation
exponent in the infrared; increasing the temperature we recover scale symmetry
in a d dependent way: while for d=2+1 a phase transition is found, for d=3+1
the transition is rather a crossover. This is the expected behavior of QCD
where the number of colors N_c equals three (although in our holographic
calculations N_c goes to infinity). When the U(1) is preserved and at low
temperatures, the system is insulating for arbitrary d if the dilaton is
appropriately coupled to the gauge field; for other couplings we also find a
linear in temperature resistivity. We then determine the prediction of these
models for several quantities in the superconducting phase: the DC and AC
conductivity, the gap for charged excitations, the superfluid density, the
vortex profiles, the coherence length, the penetration depth and the critical
magnetic fields. We show that at low temperatures some of these quantities
differ qualitatively compared with the corresponding models without the
dilaton, although the superconductor is robustly of Type II. The ratio of the
gap over the critical temperature of the superconductor is studied in detail
varying d and the couplings of the dilaton and then compared with the BCS
value. A holographic renormalization is required in d>2+1 to compute some
quantities (such as the AC conductivity and the penetration depth) and we
explain in detail how to perform it.

respect to the wire axis within the plane perpendicular to the current
direction. With the current increasing the inclination angle increases up to
the maximum value $\pi/4$. Further current increase leads either to saturation

influence of the initial conditions on the turbulence-induced disc formation
mechanism proposed recently by Seifried et al. 2012. We find that Keplerian
discs are formed in all cases independently of the core mass, the strength of
turbulence, or the presence of global rotation. The discs appear within a few
kyr after the formation of the protostar, are 50 - 150 AU in size, and have
masses between 0.05 and a few 0.1 M_sun. During the formation of the discs the
mass-to-flux ratio stays well below the critical value of 10 for Keplerian disc
formation. Hence, flux-loss alone cannot explain the formation of Keplerian
discs. The formation of rotationally supported discs at such early phases is
rather due to the disordered magnetic field structure and due to turbulent
motions in the surroundings of the discs, two effects lowering the classical
magnetic braking efficiency. Binary systems occurring in the discs are mainly
formed via the disc capturing mechanism rather than via disc fragmentation,
which is largely suppressed by the presence of magnetic fields.

dimensions is studied using the mean-field approximation. Long-range
interactions are introduced through pair interaction potentials that decay as a
power law in the interparticle distance. We compute the local entropy,
Helmholtz free energy, and grand potential per particle in the microcanonical,
canonical, and grand canonical ensembles, respectively. From the local entropy
per particle we obtain the local equation of state of the system by using the
condition of local thermodynamic equilibrium. This local equation of state has
the form of the ideal gas equation of state, but with the density depending on
the potential characterizing long-range interactions. By volume integration of
the relation between the different thermodynamic potentials at the local level,
we find the corresponding equation satisfied by the potentials at the global
level. It is shown that the potential energy enters as a thermodynamic variable
that modifies the global thermodynamic potentials. As a result, we find a
generalized Gibbs-Duhem equation that relates the potential energy to the
temperature, pressure, and chemical potential. For the marginal case where the
power of the decaying interaction potential is equal to the dimension of the
space, the usual Gibbs-Duhem equation is recovered. As examples of the
application of this equation, we consider spatially uniform interaction
potentials and the self-gravitating gas. We also point out a close relationship
with the thermodynamics of small systems.

to uncover dynamical crossovers in the space of quantum trajectories associated

qualitative changes in the fluctuations of rare quantum jump trajectories, and
have been observed in the statistics of coherently driven quantum systems. In
this article we investigate the counting statistics of rare quantum
trajectories of an undriven system undergoing a pure relaxation process,
namely, Markovian exciton transport. We find that dynamical crossovers occur in

approximately equal to the initial energy of the incident electrons, Eo. The

clues as to how they might behave in the face of unanticipated, possibly
unarticulated uncertainties. To this end, we find it beneficial to distinguish
between two types of uncertainty: ""Small World"" and ""Large World"" uncertainty.
The first type can be resolved by posing an unambiguous question to a

The second type is more troublesome, yet it is often of greater interest when
we address the issue of flexibility; this type of uncertainty can be resolved
only by consulting a ""psychic."" We next observe that one approach to
flexibility used in the economics literature is already implicitly accounted
for in the Maximum Expected Utility (MEU) principle from decision theory.

revelation. We show how to perform flexibility analysis of a static (i.e.,
single period) decision problem using a simple example, and we observe that the
most flexible alternative thus identified is not necessarily the MEU

an equivalent set of parallel (i.e., unprioritized) defaults, in
circumscription. We give an algorithm to implement the transform. We show how
to use the transform algorithm as a generator of a whole family of inferencing
algorithms for circumscription. The method is to employ the transform algorithm
as a front end to any inferencing algorithm, e.g., one of the previously
available, that handles the parallel (empty) case of prioritization. Our
algorithms provide not just coverage of a new expressive class, but also
alternatives to previous algorithms for implementing the previously covered
class (?layered?) of prioritization. In particular, we give a new
query-answering algorithm for prioritized cirumscription which is sound and
complete for the full expressive class of unrestricted finite prioritization
partial orders, for propositional defaults (or minimized predicates). By
contrast, previous algorithms required that the prioritization partial order be
layered, i.e., structured similar to the system of rank in the military. Our
algorithm enables, for the first time, the implementation of the most useful
class of prioritization: non-layered prioritization partial orders. Default
inheritance, for example, typically requires non-layered prioritization to
represent specificity adequately. Our algorithm enables not only the
implementation of default inheritance (and specificity) within prioritized
circumscription, but also the extension and combination of default inheritance
with other kinds of prioritized default reasoning, e.g.: with stratified logic
programs with negation-as-failure. Such logic programs are previously known to
be representable equivalently as layered-priority predicate circumscriptions.
Worst-case, the transform increases the number of defaults exponentially. We
discuss how inferencing is practically implementable nevertheless in two kinds
of situations: general expressiveness but small numbers of defaults, or
expressive special cases with larger numbers of defaults. One such expressive
special case is non-?top-heaviness? of the prioritization partial order. In
addition to its direct implementation, the transform can also be exploited
analytically to generate special case algorithms, e.g., a tractable transform
for a class within default inheritance (detailed in another, forthcoming
paper). We discuss other aspects of the significance of the fundamental result.
One can view the transform as reducing n degrees of partially ordered belief
confidence to just 2 degrees of confidence: for-sure and (unprioritized)
default. Ordinary, parallel default reasoning, e.g., in parallel
circumscription or Poole's Theorist, can be viewed in these terms as reducing 2
degrees of confidence to just 1 degree of confidence: that of the non-monotonic
theory's conclusions. The expressive reduction's computational complexity
suggests that prioritization is valuable for its expressive conciseness, just
as defaults are for theirs. For Reiter's Default Logic and Poole's Theorist,
the transform implies how to extend those formalisms so as to equip them with a
concept of prioritization that is exactly equivalent to that in
circumscription. This provides an interesting alternative to Brewka's approach
to equipping them with prioritization-type precedence.

system as it changes over time, both due to exogenous and endogenous
influences. Our target domain is a class of medical prediction problems that
are neither so urgent as to preclude careful diagnosis nor progress so slowly
as to allow arbitrary testing and treatment options. In these domains there is
typically enough time to gather information about the patient's state and
consider alternative diagnoses and treatments, but the temporal interaction
between the timing of tests, treatments, and the course of the disease must
also be considered. Our approach is to elicit a qualitative structural model of
the patient from a human expert---the model identifies important attributes,
the way in which exogenous changes affect attribute values, and the way in
which the patient's condition changes endogenously. We then elicit
probabilistic information to capture the expert's uncertainty about the effects
of tests and treatments and the nature and timing of endogenous state changes.
This paper describes the model in the context of a problem in treating vehicle
accident trauma, and suggests a method for solving the model based on the
technique of sequential imputation. A complementary goal of this work is to
understand and synthesize a disparate collection of research efforts all using
the name ?probabilistic temporal reasoning.? This paper analyzes related work
and points out essential differences between our proposed model and other

an increasing interest in studying planning-while-learning algorithms for these

strategies for Q-learning are of a heuristic nature and they exhibit limited
scaleability in tasks with large (or infinite) state and action spaces.
Efficient experimentation is needed for resolving uncertainties when possible

for selecting with statistical significance a locally optimal plan (i.e.
exploitation). For this purpose, we develop a probabilistic hill-climbing
algorithm that uses a statistical selection procedure to decide how much
exploration is needed for selecting a plan which is, with arbitrarily high
probability, arbitrarily close to a locally optimal one. Due to its generality
the algorithm can be employed for the exploration strategy of robust
Q-learning. An experiment on a relatively complex control task shows that the

second problem facing probabilistic model-based diagnosis is the modeling of

another observation at a later time t_2. To compute posterior probabilities
that take into account both the observations, we need some model of how the

these problems using techniques from Reliability theory. We show how to compute

Notices (2013)","10.1093/imrn/rnt173",,"math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Special birational transformations $\Phi:\p^r\da Z$ defined by quadric
hypersurfaces are studied by means of the variety of lines $\mathcal
L_z\subset\p^{r-1}$ passing through a general point $z\in Z$. Classification
results are obtained when $Z$ is either a Grassmannian of lines, or the
10-dimensional spinor variety, or the $E_6$-variety. In the particular case of
quadro-quadric transformations, we extend the well-known classification of Ein
and Shepherd-Barron coming from Zak's classification of Severi varieties to a
wider class of prime Fano manifolds $Z$. Combining both results, we get a
classification of special birational transformations $\Phi:\p^r\da Z$ defined
by quadric hypersurfaces onto (a linear setion of) a rational homogeneous
variety different from a projective space and a quadric hypersurface.

compute their equivalence classes under the action of the general linear group
$GL_3 (\mathbb{F}_p )$. We use computer algebra to determine the set of tensors
of each symmetric rank, then we compute the orbit of the group action. We
determine the maximum symmetric rank of these tensors and compare it with the
maximum rank.

clusters in the nearby irregular galaxy NGC 4214 is probed using
multi-wavelength Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 data. We normalize the ionizing
photon rate by the cluster mass to investigate the upper end of the stellar
initial mass function (IMF). We have found that within the uncertainties the
upper end of the stellar IMF appears to be universal in this galaxy, and that
deviations from a universal IMF can be attributed to stochastic sampling of
stars in clusters with masses < 10^3 M_sun. Furthermore, we have found that
there does not seem to be a dependence of the maximum stellar mass on the
cluster mass. We have also found that for massive clusters, feedback may cause
an underrepresentation in Ha luminosities, which needs to be taken into account
when conducting this type of analysis.

Mathematica technical computing software, curve fitting is employed to
determine the functions which best reflect how surpluses and deficits
accumulate with time. It is shown that both EU and the Eurozone economies
ultimately have to pass through a critical, turning point beyond which the
accumulation of deficits exceeds the accumulation of surpluses thus marking a
period of instability. An interval estimate at a ninety eight percent degree of
confidence, yields that EU is found in a phase of instability since 2011 while
the instability turning point for the Eurozone is bound to occur any year from
2015 to 2018.

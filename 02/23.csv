improve the efficiency of quantum transport by suppressing coherent
single-particle interference effects. However, it is not yet clear whether
dephasing can enhance transport in an interacting many-body system. Here, we
address this question by analyzing the transport properties of a boundary
driven spinless fermion chain with nearest-neighbor interactions subject to
bulk dephasing. The many-body nonequilibrium stationary state is determined
using large-scale matrix product simulations of the corresponding quantum
master equation. We find dephasing enhanced transport only in the strongly
interacting regime, where it is shown to induce incoherent transitions bridging
the gap between bound dark states and bands of mobile eigenstates. The generic
nature of the transport enhancement is illustrated by a simple toy model, which
contains the basic elements required for its emergence. Surprisingly, the
effect is significant even in the linear response regime of the full system,
and it is predicted to exist for any large and finite chain. The response of
the system to dephasing also establishes a signature of an underlying
nonequilibrium phase transition between regimes of transport degradation and
enhancement. The existence of this transition is shown not to depend on the
integrability of the model considered. As a result, dephasing enhanced
transport is expected to persist in more realistic nonequilibrium strongly
correlated systems.

accretion disks (SCAD) based on the conception by Shakura and Sunyaev. We apply
this model to five ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs). In this approach, the
disk becomes thick at distances to the center less than the spherization
radius, and the temperature dependence is T \propto r^{-1/2}. In this region
the disk luminosity is L_bol ~ L_Edd ln(Mdot/Mdot_Edd), and strong wind arises
forming a wind funnel above the disk. Outside the spherization radius, the disk
is thin and its total luminosity is Eddington, L_Edd. The thin disk heats the
wind from below. From the inner side of the funnel the wind is heated by the
supercritical disk. In this paper we do not consider Comptonization in the
inner hot winds which must cover the deep supercritical disk regions. Our model
is technically similar to the DISKIR model of Gierlinski et al. The models
differ in disk type (standard - supercritical) and irradiation (disk - wind).
We propose to distinguish between these two models in the X-ray region, ~0.3 -
1 keV, where the SCAD model has a flat nu F_nu spectrum, and the DISKIR model
never has a flat part, as it is based on the standard alpha-disk. An important
difference between the models can be found in their resulting black hole
masses. In application to the ULX spectra, the DISKIR model yields black hole
masses of a few hundred solar masses, whereas the SCAD model produces
stellar-mass black holes ~10 M_sun.

Surprisingly, using the technique of Harish-Chandra superpairs and a complete
description of an action of an algebraic supergroup on an abelian supergroups

questions. Besides, the second counterexample shows that the reductivity of G
does not imply that G_{ev} has even finite unipotent radical. On the other
hand, if G_{ev} is reductive, then it is easy to see that G_u is finite (odd)
supergroup. In other words, the reductivity of an algebraic supergroup does not
correspond to the reductivity of its largest even subgroup in contrast to such
properties as unipotency or solvability. In the last section of our article we
describe reductive algebraic supergroups in terms of sandwich pairs and give
necessary and sufficient conditions for an algebraic supergroup to be
quasireductive. The last result complements the recent Serganova's description

obtain more accurate parameters for NGC 7419, using techniques different from
those of previous authors, so that it may be used as a calibrator for more
obscured clusters. We obtained Str\""omgren photometry of the open cluster NGC
7419, as well as classification spectroscopy of ~20 stars in the area. We then
applied standard analysis and classification techniques. We find a distance of
4+-0.4 kpc and an age of 14+-2 Myr for NGC 7419. The main-sequence turn-off is
found at spectral type B1, in excellent agreement. We identify 179 B-type
members, implying that there are more than 1200 $M_{\sun}$ in B stars at
present. Extrapolating this to lower masses indicates an initial cluster mass
of between 7000 and 10000 Msolar, depending on the shape of the Initial Mass
Function. We find a very high fraction (~40%) of Be stars around the turn-off,
but very few Be stars at lower masses. We also report for the first time a
strong variability in the emission characteristics of Be stars. We verified
that the parameters of the red supergiant members can be used to obtain
accurate cluster parameters. NGC 7419 is sufficiently massive to serve as a
testbed for theoretical predictions and as a template to compare more obscured
clusters. The distribution of stars above the main-sequence turn-off is

transmission delays over large distances due to more direct routes and faster
wave propagation. In order to bridge large distances, information is sent over
a multihop relay network.
  Motivated by these applications, this papers present an information-theoretic
approach to the design of optimal multihop microwave networks that minimizes
end-to-end transmission delay. To characterize the delay introduced by coding,
we derive error exponents achievable in multihop networks. We formulate and
solve an optimization problem that determines optimal selection of

nearby galaxies, more distant (radio) galaxies, quasars, and even intergalactic
space in clusters of galaxies have significant magnetic fields, and even larger
volumes of the Universe may be permeated by 'dark' magnetic fields. Information
on cosmic magnetic fields has increased enormously as the result of the rapid
development of observational methods, especially in radio astronomy. In the
Milky Way, a wealth of magnetic phenomena was discovered that are only partly
related to objects visible in other spectral ranges. The large-scale structure
of the Milky Way's magnetic field is still under debate. The available data for
external galaxies can well be explained by field amplification and ordering via
the dynamo mechanism. The measured field strengths and the similarity of field
patterns and flow patterns of the diffuse ionized gas give strong indication
that galactic magnetic fields are dynamically important. They may affect the
formation of spiral arms, outflows, and the general evolution of galaxies. In
spite of our increasing knowledge on magnetic fields, many important questions
on the origin and evolution of magnetic fields, like their first occurrence in
young galaxies, or the existence of large-scale intergalactic fields remained
unanswered. 'Cosmic magnetism' is a key science project for several existing

order of tau~30 s. The accuracy in the absolute values have been tested by
comparing them to relaxation-method results obtained in the same samples
(performed in situ using the same set-up), with a deviation between the
absolute values < 3% in the whole temperature range. This new version of the
continuous calorimetric method at low temperatures allows us to completely
characterize and measure a sample within a few hours with a high density of

  variants",,,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A symmetry group for Sudoku is complete if its action partitions the set of
Sudoku boards into all possible orbits, and minimal if no group of smaller size
would do the same. Previously, for a 4 x 4 Sudoku variation known as Shidoku,
the authors used an analogous symmetry group to partition the set of Shidoku
boards into so-called ""nests"" and then use the interplay between the physical
and relabeling symmetries to find certain subgroups that were both complete and
minimal. In this paper these same techniques are applied to find a minimal
complete symmetry group for the modular magic Sudoku variation, as well as for
another Sudoku variation called semi-magic Sudoku. The paper concludes with a
simple computation which leads to the non-obvious fact that the full Sudoku
symmetry group is, in fact, already minimal and complete.

demand on the use of a large scale multicore systems in a efficient way, so
that high compute-intensive applications can be executed reasonably well.
However, the exploitation of the degree of parallelism available at each

hierarchy available. Actually, the multicore architecture introduces some
distinct features that are already observed in shared memory and distributed
environments. One example is that subsets of cores can share different subsets
of memory. In order to achieve high performance it is imperative that a careful
allocation scheme of an application is carried out on the available cores,
based on a scheduling model that considers the main performance bottlenecks, as
for example, memory contention. In this paper, the {\em Multicore Cluster

lowest electronically excited state is of ${}^{2}\Pi$ symmetry (in contrast to
BaF), such that no low-lying ${}^{2}\Delta$ state prevents efficient optical
cooling cycles. ii) The effective electric field acting on the unpaired
electron in the electronic ground state of RaF is estimated larger than in YbF,
from which the best restrictions on the electron electric dipole moment (eEDM)

levels of opposite parity in external magnetic fields exist, which are
important for the measurement of the nuclear anapole moment of nuclei with a
valence neutron. Thus, RaF appears currently as one of the most attractive
candidates for investigation of parity-odd as well as simultaneously parity-

curvature, or even whether or not it is complete, there exists an
instantaneously complete Ricci flow evolution of that surface that exists for a
specific amount of time [GT11]. In the case that the underlying Riemann surface
supports a hyperbolic metric, this Ricci flow always exists for all time and
converges (after scaling by a factor $\frac1{2t}$) to this hyperbolic metric
[GT11], i.e. our Ricci flow geometrises the surface. In this paper we show that
there exist complete, bounded curvature initial metrics, including those
conformal to a hyperbolic metric, which have subsequent Ricci flows developing
unbounded curvature at certain intermediate times. In particular, when coupled
with the uniqueness from [Top13], we find that any complete Ricci flow starting
with such initial metrics must develop unbounded curvature over some
intermediate time interval, but that nevertheless, the curvature must later
become bounded and the flow must achieve geometrisation as $t\to\infty$, even
though there are other conformal deformations to hyperbolic metrics that do not
involve unbounded curvature.
  Another consequence of our constructions is that while our Ricci flow from
[GT11] must agree initially with the classical flow of Hamilton and Shi in the
special case that the initial surface is complete and of bounded curvature, by
uniqueness, it is now clear that our flow lasts for a longer time interval in
general, with Shi's flow stopping when the curvature blows up, but our flow
continuing strictly beyond in these situations.
  All our constructions of unbounded curvature developing and then disappearing
are in two dimensions. Generalisations to higher dimensions are then immediate.

of water show anomalous behavior. Like in real water, the heat capacity and
compressibility sharply increase upon supercooling. One of the possible
explanations of these anomalies, the existence of a second (liquid-liquid)
critical point, is not supported by simulations for this model. In this work,
we reproduce the anomalies of the mW model with two thermodynamic scenarios:
one based on a non-ideal ""mixture"" with two different types of local order of
the water molecules, and one based on weak crystallization theory. We show that
both descriptions accurately reproduce the model's basic thermodynamic
properties. However, the coupling constant required for the power laws implied
by weak crystallization theory is too large relative to the regular
backgrounds, contradicting assumptions of weak crystallization theory.
Fluctuation corrections outside the scope of this work would be necessary to
fit the forms predicted by weak crystallization theory. For the two-state
approach, the direct computation of the low-density fraction of molecules in
the mW model is in agreement with the prediction of the phenomenological
equation of state. The non-ideality of the ""mixture"" of the two states never
becomes strong enough to cause liquid-liquid phase separation, also in
agreement with simulation results.

available, from perfect to no information. In literature, capacity derivations
for wireless ergodic fading channels, specifically for fading BCs, mostly rely
on the analysis of channels comprising of parallel sub-channels. This technique
is usually suitable for the cases where perfect state information is available
at the transmitters. In this paper, new arguments are proposed to directly
derive (without resorting to the analysis of parallel channels) capacity bounds
for the two-user fading BC with both common and private messages based on the
existing bounds for the discrete channel. Specifically, a novel approach is
developed to adapt and evaluate the well-known UV-outer bound for the Gaussian
fading channel using the entropy power inequality. Our approach indeed sheds
light on the role of broadcast auxiliaries in the fading channel. It is shown
that the derived outer bound is optimal for the channel with perfect CSIT as
well as for some special cases with partial CSIT. Our outer bound is also
directly applicable to the case without CSIT which has been recently considered
in several papers. Next, the approach is developed to analyze for the fading BC
with secrecy. In the case of perfect CSIT, a full characterization of the
secrecy capacity region is derived for the channel with common and confidential
messages. This result completes a gap in a previous work by Ekrem and Ulukus.
For the channel without common message, the secrecy capacity region is also
derived when the transmitter has access only to the degradedness ordering of
the channel.

cosmological candles, though the nature of their progenitors is a subject of
active investigation. Recent observational and theoretical work has pointed to
merging white dwarf binaries, referred to as the double-degenerate channel, as
the possible progenitor systems for some SNe Ia. Additionally, recent
theoretical work suggests that mergers which fail to detonate may produce
magnetized, rapidly-rotating white dwarfs. In this paper, we present the first
multidimensional simulations of the post-merger evolution of white dwarf
binaries to include the effect of the magnetic field. In these systems, the two
white dwarfs complete a final merger on a dynamical timescale, and are tidally
disrupted, producing a rapidly-rotating white dwarf merger surrounded by a hot
corona and a thick, differentially-rotating disk. The disk is strongly
susceptible to the magnetorotational instability (MRI), and we demonstrate that
this leads to the rapid growth of an initially dynamically weak magnetic field
in the disk, the spin-down of the white dwarf merger, and to the subsequent
central ignition of the white dwarf merger. Additionally, these magnetized
models exhibit new features not present in prior hydrodynamic studies of white
dwarf mergers, including the development of MRI turbulence in the hot disk,
magnetized outflows carrying a significant fraction of the disk mass, and the
magnetization of the white dwarf merger to field strengths $\sim 2 \times 10^8$

of bulges and inner discs is, however, poorly understood observationally due to
the small number of studies focusing on the stellar populations of these
systems. In order to provide constraints on the relevant processes inducing the
creation of these components in the presence of inner bars, we have carried out
a detailed kinematical and stellar population analysis in a sample of four
double-barred galaxies, ranging from SB0 to SBb, observed with integral-field
spectroscopy. We find that the inner bars present distinct stellar population
properties, being younger and more metal-rich than the surrounding bulges and
outer bars. While we detect signatures of gas inflow through the inner bars, we
find no evidence of associated star-forming regions or newly-formed structures
around them. This result suggests that, regardless of their formation scenario,
at present these inner bars are playing a moderate or even a minor role in the
morphological evolution of this sample of double-barred galaxies.

source even after removing potential AGN, supporting the idea that compact
starbursts show spectral flattening as the result of increased free-free

reveal that the large disk depletion factor invoked to explain SR21's sub-mm

moderate depletions (delta=0.1, 0.01 relative to an undepleted disk) than those
that reproduce the sub-mm cavity (delta~10^-6) are inconsistent with our H-band
images when they are assumed to carry over to small grains, suggesting that
surface grains scattering in the NIR either survive or are generated by
whatever mechanism is clearing the disk midplane. In fact, the radial polarized
intensity profile of our H-band observations is smooth and steeply
inwardly-increasing (r^-3), with no evidence of a break at the 36AU sub-mm
cavity wall. We hypothesize that this profile is dominated by an optically thin
disk envelope or atmosphere component. We also discuss the compatibility of our

the ionisation states of the 11 elements that dominate the cooling and uses
tabulated ion-by-ion cooling and photo-heating efficiencies to update the

recombination, collisional ionisation, photo-ionisation, Auger ionisation, and
charge transfer. We verify that our method reproduces published results for
collisional equilibrium, collisional non-equilibrium, and photo-ionised
equilibrium. Non-equilibrium effects can become very important in cooling gas,
particularly below 10^6 K. Photo-ionisation and non-equilibrium effects both
tend to boost the degree of ionisation and to reduce cooling efficiencies. The
effect of the EGB is larger for lower densities. Hence, photo-ionisation
affects cooling more under isochoric than under isobaric conditions.
Non-equilibrium effects are smaller in the presence of the EGB and are thus
overestimated when using collisional-only processes. The inclusion of the EGB
alters the observational diagnostics of diffuse, metal-enriched gas (e.g. metal
absorption lines) even more significantly than the cooling efficiencies. We
argue that the cooling efficiency should be considered if ionisation models are
used to infer physical conditions from observed line ratios, as the a priori
probability of observing gas is lower if its cooling time is shorter. We
provide on-line tables of ionisation fractions and cooling efficiencies for

Memory signal. While all relativistic jet models display anti-beaming of GW
radiation away from the jet axis, thus radiating away from directions of GRBs'
gamma radiation, this effect is not overwhelming. The decrease of the signal
amplitude towards the cone of gamma-ray detectability is weak, and for some

different waveforms and fourier signatures for uniform jets and structured jet
models - thus offering a method of using GW signatures to probe the internal
structure and acceleration of GRB jets. The GW signal peaks just outside the
jet (core) of a uniform (structuted) jet. Within the jet (core) the GW signal
displays wiggles, due to a polarization effect; thus for a uniform jet, the
peak amplitude accompanies a smoother signal than the peak of a structured jet.
For the most probable detection angle and for typical GRB parameters, we expect
frequencies < ~600Hz and amplitudes h~10^-25. Our estimates of the expected
signals suggest that the signals are not strong enough for a single cluster of
DECIGO nor for aLIGO's sensitivities. However, sensitivies of ~10^-25/sqrt(Hz)
in the DECIGO band should suffice to detect typical long GRBs at 2Gpc and short
GRBs at 200Mpc, implying a monthly event of a long GRB and a detection of a
short GRB every decade. In addition, we expect much more frequent detection of
GW from GRBs directed away from us, including orphan afterglows. The ultimate
DECIGO sensitivy should increase the range and enable detecting these signals
in all models even to high cosmological z.

initial shear field associated with Gaussian statistics, called the `peak/dip
excursion-set-based' algorithm, at positions which correspond to peaks or dips
of the correlated density field. The computational procedure is based on a new
formula which extends Doroshkevich's unconditional distribution for the
eigenvalues of the linear tidal field, to account for the fact that halos and
voids may correspond to maxima or minima of the density field. The ability to
differentiate between random positions and special points in space around which
halos or voids may form (peaks/dips), encoded in the new formula and reflected
in the algorithm, naturally leads to a straightforward implementation of an
excursion set model for peaks and dips in Gaussian random fields - one of the
key advantages of this sampling procedure. In addition, it offers novel
insights into the statistical description of the cosmic web. As a first
physical application, we show how the standard distributions of shear
ellipticity and prolateness in triaxial models of structure formation are
modified by the constraint. In particular, we provide a new expression for the
conditional distribution of shape parameters given the density peak constraint,
which generalizes some previous literature work. The formula has important
implications for the modeling of non-spherical dark matter halo shapes, in
relation to their initial shape distribution. We also test and confirm our
theoretical predictions for the individual distributions of eigenvalues
subjected to the extremum constraint, along with other directly related
conditional probabilities. Finally, we indicate how the proposed sampling
procedure naturally integrates into the standard excursion set model,
potentially solving some of its well-known problems, and into the ellipsoidal
collapse framework. (abridged)

a population of $n$ potential experiment subjects $i\in \{1,...,n\}$, each
associated with a vector of features $x_i\in R^d$. Conducting an experiment
with subject $i$ reveals an unknown value $y_i\in R$ to E. E typically assumes
some hypothetical relationship between $x_i$'s and $y_i$'s, e.g., $y_i \approx
\beta x_i$, and estimates $\beta$ from experiments, e.g., through linear
regression. As a proxy for various practical constraints, E may select only a
subset of subjects on which to conduct the experiment.
  We initiate the study of budgeted mechanisms for experimental design. In this
setting, E has a budget $B$. Each subject $i$ declares an associated cost $c_i
>0$ to be part of the experiment, and must be paid at least her cost. In
particular, the Experimental Design Problem (EDP) is to find a set $S$ of
subjects for the experiment that maximizes $V(S) = \log\det(I_d+\sum_{i\in
S}x_i\T{x_i})$ under the constraint $\sum_{i\in S}c_i\leq B$; our objective
function corresponds to the information gain in parameter $\beta$ that is
learned through linear regression methods, and is related to the so-called
$D$-optimality criterion. Further, the subjects are strategic and may lie about
their costs.
  We present a deterministic, polynomial time, budget feasible mechanism
scheme, that is approximately truthful and yields a constant factor
approximation to EDP. In particular, for any small $\delta > 0$ and $\epsilon >
0$, we can construct a (12.98, $\epsilon$)-approximate mechanism that is
$\delta$-truthful and runs in polynomial time in both $n$ and
$\log\log\frac{B}{\epsilon\delta}$. We also establish that no truthful,
budget-feasible algorithms is possible within a factor 2 approximation, and
show how to generalize our approach to a wide class of learning problems,
beyond linear regression.

based on slowly changing the Hamiltonian parameters in the QMC simulation
succeed in a polynomial time? We show that this is not true, by constructing
counter-examples. Some examples are Hamiltonians where the space of
configurations where the wavefunction has non-negligible amplitude has a
nontrivial fundamental group, causing the space of trajectories in imaginary
time to break into disconnected components, with only negligible probability
outside these components. For the simplest example we give with an abelian
fundamental group, QMC does not equilibrate but still solves the optimization
problem. More severe effects leading to failure to solve the optimization can
occur when the fundamental group is a free group on two generators. Other
examples where QMC fails have a trivial fundamental group, but still use ideas
from topology relating group presentations to simplicial complexes. We define
gadgets to realize these Hamiltonians as the effective low-energy dynamics of a

various attacks such as stepping stones. We study the problem of designing good
flow watermarks. Earlier flow watermarking schemes mostly considered
substitution errors, neglecting the effects of packet insertions and deletions
that commonly happen within a network. More recent schemes consider packet
deletions but often at the expense of the watermark visibility. We present an
invisible flow watermarking scheme capable of enduring a large number of packet
losses and insertions. To maintain invisibility, our scheme uses quantization
index modulation (QIM) to embed the watermark into inter-packet delays, as
opposed to time intervals including many packets. As the watermark is injected
within individual packets, packet losses and insertions may lead to watermark
desynchronization and substitution errors. To address this issue, we add a
layer of error-correction coding to our scheme. Experimental results on both
synthetic and real network traces demonstrate that our scheme is robust to
network jitter, packet drops and splits, while remaining invisible to an
attacker.

assigning to each equivalence class of words the length of the words, and let
$P_{M, \deg}(t):= \sum_{u \in\ M}t^{\deg(u)}$ be its generating series, called
the growth function. If $M$ satisfies the condition that any subset $J$ of
$I_0$ ($:=$ the image of the set $L$ in $M$) admits either the least right
common multiple $\Delta_{J}$ or no common multiple in $M$, then the inversion
function $P_{M, \deg}(t)^{-1}$ is given by the polynomial $\sum_{J \subset
I_{0}}(-1)^{#J} t^{\deg(\Delta_{J})}$, where the summation index $J$ runs over
all subsets of $I_0$ whose least right common multiple exists. Since a monoid
$M$ generally may not admit the least right common multiple $\Delta_{J}$ for a
given subset $J$ of it, if we attempt to generalize the formula, the
consideration to obtain the above formula is invalid. To resolve this
obstruction, we will examine the set $\mathrm{mcm}(J)$ of minimal common right
multiples of $J$. Then, we need to introduce a concept of a tower of minimal
common multiples of elements of $M$ and denote the set of all the towers in $M$
by $\mathrm{Tmcm}(M)$. Considering the structure of the set $\mathrm{Tmcm}(M)$,
K. Saito has proved the inversion formula \[ P_{M,\deg}(t). N_{M,\deg}(t)=1, \]

N_{M,\deg}(t):= 1 + \sum_{T\in

investigate the underlying physics is also essential, particularly when
simulations and experiments are not consistent with each other. This is a
difficult task, due to the large number of physical models that play a role,
and due to the complex (and as a result, noisy) nature of the experiments. This
results in a large number of parameters that make any inference a daunting
task; it is also very important to consistently treat both experimental and
prior understanding of the problem. In this paper we present a Bayesian method
that includes both these effects, and allows the inference of a set of
modifiers which have been constructed to give information about microphysics
models from experimental data. We pay particular attention to radiation
transport models. The inference takes into account a large set of experimental
parameters and an estimate of the prior knowledge through a modified $\chi^{2}$
function, which is minimised using an efficient genetic algorithm. Both factors
play an essential role in our analysis. We find that although there is evidence

allows all important experimental parameters, and previous knowledge, to be
taken into account when investigating underlying microphysics models. The
result is framed as a modified $\chi^{2}$ analysis which is easy to implement
in existing analyses, and quite portable. We present a first application to a
recent convergent ablator experiment performed at the NIF, and investigate the
effect of variations in all physical dimensions of the target (very difficult
to do using other methods). We show that for well characterised targets in
which dimensions vary at the 0.5% level there is little effect, but 3%
variations change the results of inferences dramatically. Our Bayesian method
allows particular inference results to be associated with prior errors in
microphysics models; in our example, tuning the carbon opacity to match
experimental data (i.e., ignoring prior knowledge) is equivalent to an assumed
prior error of 400% in the tabop opacity tables. This large error is
unreasonable, underlining the importance of including prior knowledge in the
analysis of these experiments.

${\nu}_e$ cross sections on $^{12}$C as well as a nucleon in nuclear matter are
reduced by about 5% at the nuclear saturation density, $\rho_0$. This reduction
is caused by the modification of the nucleon structure in matter. Although the
density effect for both cases is relatively small, it is comparable with the
effect of Coulomb distortion on the outgoing lepton in the $\nu$-reaction. In
contrast, the density effect on the ${\bar \nu}_e$ reaction reduces the cross
section significantly in both nuclear matter and $^{12}$C cases, and the amount
maximally becomes of about 35% around $\rho_0$. Such large asymmetry in the
$\nu_e$ and ${\bar \nu}_e$ cross sections, which seems to be nearly independent

work establishes a {\it dichotomy} of well-posedness and ill-posedness
depending on $r=2$ or $r>2$. Specifically, by combining the new endpoint
bilinear estimates in $L^{q_\alpha}_x L^2_T$ with the characterization of
Triebel-Lizorkin space via fractional semigroup, we prove the well-posedness of
the gNS in $\dot{F}^{-\alpha,r}_{q_\alpha}(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for $r=2$. On the

{\it norm inflation} in the sense that arbitrarily small initial data in the
spaces $\dot{F}^{-\alpha,r}_{q_\alpha}(\mathbb{R}^3)$ can lead the
corresponding solution to become arbitrarily large after an arbitrarily short
time. In particular, such dichotomy of Triebel-Lizorkin spaces is also true for
the classical N-S equations, i.e.\,\,$\alpha=1$. Thus the Triebel-Lizorkin

soft and medium energy \gamma-ray bands have been conducted using detectors
based on inorganic scintillators read out by photo-multiplier tubes (PMTs).
These observations were limited by the modest energy and time resolution of
traditional scintillator materials (e.g. NaI and CsI), and by the demands on
mission resources imposed by the bulky, fragile, high-voltage PMTs. Recent
technological advances in the development of both new scintillator materials
(e.g. LaBr3:Ce, L(Y)SO) and new scintillation light readout devices (e.g.
Silicon Photo-Multipliers) promise to greatly improve the observational

low-cost of scintillator instruments. We present initial results of a study on

Most community detection algorithms are based on optimizing a combinatorial

merely changing the vertex order can alter their assignments to the community.
However, there has been very less study on how vertex ordering influences the
results of the community detection algorithms. Here we identify and study the
properties of invariant groups of vertices (constant communities) whose
assignment to communities are, quite remarkably, not affected by vertex
ordering. The percentage of constant communities can vary across different
applications and based on empirical results we propose metrics to evaluate
these communities. Using constant communities as a pre-processing step, one can
significantly reduce the variation of the results. Finally, we present a case
study on phoneme network and illustrate that constant communities, quite
strikingly, form the core functional units of the larger communities.

Communication-Centric Software) is the fifth edition of the PLACES workshop
series. After the first PLACES, which was affiliated to DisCoTec in 2008, the
workshop has been part of ETAPS every year since 2009 and is now an established
part of the ETAPS satellite events. PLACES 2012 was held on 31st March in
Tallinn, Estonia.
  The workshop series was started in order to promote the application of novel
programming language ideas to the increasingly important problem of developing
software for systems in which concurrency and communication are intrinsic
aspects. This includes software for both multi-core systems and large-scale
distributed and/or service-oriented systems. The scope of PLACES includes new
programming language features, whole new programming language designs, new type
systems, new semantic approaches, new program analysis techniques, and new
implementation mechanisms.
  This year's call for papers attracted 17 submissions, from which the
programme committee selected 10 papers for presentation at the workshop. After
the workshop, all of the authors were invited to produce revised versions of
their papers for inclusion in the EPTCS proceedings. The authors of six papers
accepted the invitation, and those papers constitute the present volume.

anisotropy of CMB. The main contribution comes from z<2, where dark energy
leads to a decay of potentials. As the same photons are gravitationally lensed
by these decaying potentials, there exists a high degree of correlation between
the ISW effect and CMB lensing, leading to a non-zero three-point correlation
(bispectrum) of the observed temperature anisotropy. This ISW-lensing
bispectrum, whose shape resembles that of the so-called ""local-form"" primordial
bispectrum parametrized by fNL, is known to be the largest contamination of
fNL. In order to avoid a spurious detection of primordial non-Gaussianity, we
need to remove the ISW-lensing bias. In this work, we investigate three
debiasing methods: (I) subtraction of an expected, ensemble average of the
ISW-lensing bispectrum; (II) subtraction of a measured ISW-lensing bispectrum;
and (III) direct subtraction of an estimated ISW signal from an observed
temperature map. One may use an estimation of the ISW map from external non-CMB
data or that from the CMB data themselves. As the methods II and III are based
on fewer assumptions about the nature of dark energy, they are preferred over
the method I. While the methods I and II yield unbiased estimates of fNL with
comparable error bars, the method III yields a biased result when the
underlying primordial fNL is non-zero and the ISW map is estimated from a
lensing potential reconstructed from the observed temperature map. One of the
sources of the bias is a lensing reconstruction noise bias which is independent
of fNL and can be calculated precisely, but other fNL-dependent terms are
difficult to compute reliably. We thus conclude that the method II is the best,
model-independent way to remove the ISW-lensing bias of fNL, enabling us to
test the physics of inflation with smaller systematic errors.

nonrelaxed galaxy systems with respect to the supercluster environment. Using
the FoF algorithm, 40 galaxy groups were identified in this region. We
classified the systems according to the results of normality and substructure
tests applied to member galaxies. Then, we studied the relative distribution of
relaxed and nonrelaxed systems across the supercluster. We find that 68% of
galaxy groups are Gaussian and that all the non-Gaussian systems have
substructures and probably correspond to multimodal systems in redshift space.
We also find that the Gaussian systems inhabit the denser regions of the
supercluster, with higher densities of both red and blue galaxies within 2.5
Mpc, and have smaller group-group pairwise separations. Our results suggest a
spatial segregation of dynamical states, where relaxed systems may have formed
and evolved earlier and faster around high-density peaks, while nonrelaxed
systems may be growing slower on the peripheries of lower density peaks. In
this picture, galaxy clustering seems to be prompting a continuous internal
evolution in the supercluster, with several groups collapsing into the more
evolved and contracted regions.

species, edges are ""who eats whom"" relationships and weights are rates of
energy or nutrients transfer between species. Allometric scaling is a
ubiquitous feature for flow systems like river basins, vascular networks and
food webs. By ""ecological network analysis"" method, we can reveal the hidden
allometry directly on the original flow networks without cutting edges. On the
other hand, dissipation law, which is another significant scaling relationship
between the energy dissipation (respiration) and the throughflow of any species
is also discovered on the collected flow networks. Interestingly, the exponents
of allometric law ($\eta$) and the dissipation law ($\gamma$) have a strong
connection for both empirical and simulated flow networks. The dissipation law
exponent $\gamma$ rather than the topology of the network is the most important
ingredient to the allometric exponent $\eta$. By reinterpreting $\eta$ as the
inequality of species impacts (direct and indirect influences) to the whole
network along all energy flow pathways but not the energy transportation
efficiency, we found that as $\gamma$ increases, the relative energy loss of
large nodes (with high throughflow) increases, $\eta$ decreases, and the
inequality of the whole flow network as well as the relative importance of
large species decreases. Therefore, flow structure and thermodynamic constraint
are connected.

has not been applied before. Specifically, for dynamical networks on convergent
sequences of simple and weighted graphs, we prove convergence of solutions of
the initial-value problems for discrete models to those of the limiting
continuous equations. In addition, for sequences of simple graphs converging to
{0, 1}-valued graphons, it is shown that the convergence rate depends on the
fractal dimension of the boundary of the support of the graph limit. These
results are then used to study the regions of continuity of chimera states and
the attractors of the nonlocal Kuramoto equation on certain multipartite
graphs. Furthermore, the analytical tools developed in this work are used in
the rigorous justification of the continuum limit for networks on random graphs
that we undertake in a companion paper (Medvedev, 2013).
  As a by-product of the analysis of the continuum limit on deterministic and

sky (delta Vel A), and a nearby third star located ~0.6"" away (delta Vel B).
The proximity of delta Vel B (usable as a reference) makes it a particularly
well-suited target to detect the astrometric displacement of the center of
light of the eclipsing pair. Aims. We obtained NACO astrometric observations
with two goals: (1) to confirm the orientation of the orbital plane of the
eclipsing pair on the sky determined by interferometry (Paper III) and (2)
demonstrate the capabilities of narrow-angle adaptive optics astrometry on a
simple system with predictable astrometric properties. Methods. We measured the
angular separation vector between the eclipsing binary delta Vel A and the
visual companion delta Vel B from narrow-band images at 2.17 microns obtained
with the VLT/NACO adaptive optics system. Based on these observations and our
previous determination of the orbital parameters of the wide binary delta Vel
A-B, we derive the apparent displacement of the center-of-light of the
eclipsing pair at 11 epochs over its orbital cycle. Results. We detect the
astrometric wobble of the center of light of the delta Vel A pair relatively to
B with a typical measurement precision of ~50 microarcseconds per epoch, for a
total amplitude of the measured displacement of ~2 milliarcseconds.
Conclusions. The detected wobble is in agreement with our model presented in
Paper III and confirms the orientation of the Aab orbital plane on the sky. The
residual dispersion compared to our model is 110 microarcseconds rms, that we
tentatively attribute to photometric variability of the fast rotating A-type
components Aa and/or Ab in the BrGamma line. Based on these results, we
conclude that in favorable conditions (bright source with only two resolved
components, small angular separation), narrow-angle astrometry with adaptive
optics on an 8-meter class telescope can reach an accuracy of 50 to 100
microarcseconds.

force D1S as an effective pairing interaction, both CDF models can provide
appropriate descriptions on the OESs of nuclear binding energies for C, O, Ca,
Ni, Zr, Sn, Ce, Gd and Pb isotopes as well as for N=50 and 82 isotones.
However, due to the inconsistence between the non-relativistic pairing
interaction and the relativistic effective Lagrangians, there exist some
systematical discrepancies from the data, i.e., the underestimated OESs in
light C and O isotopes and the overestimated ones in heavy region,
respectively. Such discrepancies can be eliminated partially by introducing a
$Z$- or $N$-dependent strength factor into the pairing force Gogny D1S. In
addition, successful descriptions of the occupation numbers of Sn isotopes are
achieved with the optimized Gogny pairing force. Furthermore, the analysis of

continuous and discrete variables on an equal footing. This generalization of
calculus was developed independently of the ""Calculus on Time Scales""
literature but may be seen to have interesting overlap with it as well as with
the ""h-Calculus"" of the book Quantum Calculus by V. Kac and P. Cheung. As in
the time scales literature, we first derive discrete analogues of all the
common continuous calculus functions with an eye to maintaining as much
similarity as possible between these discrete analogues and their continuous
forebears. For example, in order to maintain the crucial property that the
derivative of an exponential is a constant times itself, we replace the
continuous exponential, $e^{ax}$, with a discrete function, $e_{\Delta x}(a,x)
= [1+a \Delta x]^{x / \Delta x}$. Next, we develop a unified method of
evaluating integrals of discrete variables. We discover that summations such as
the Riemann Zeta Function, the Hurwitz Zeta Function, and the Digamma Function
frequently appear in evaluating such integrals. Thus, we subsume these
functions into a generalization of the natural logarithm, which we name
""$lnd(n,\Delta x,x)$"", and evaluate many types of discrete variable integrals
in terms of it. We provide a computer program, LNDX, to evaluate the
$lnd(n,\Delta x,x)$ function. Then, we develop a theory of control system
analysis based on what we name a ""$K_{\Delta x}$ Transform,"" which is related
to the well-known Z Transform but has advantages beyond it. In closing, we
highlight the fact that this document is structured somewhat like a textbook
with many sample problems and solutions in the hope that it will be readily
understood and found useful by those with even an undergraduate understanding
of calculus and control systems.

Shalev except when the ground field is of characteristic 2. We resolve the
characteristic 2 case here which completes the classification. As an
application of our result, we obtain a characterization of ordinary Lie
algebras over any field whose enveloping algebra is Lie solvable.

dependence in high-dimensional binary data. Several measures are in use
differing on specific tables and in their dependence on the margins.
  We study a 2-dimensional group of margin transformations on the 3-dimensional
manifold T of all 2x2 probability tables. The margin transformations allow
introducing natural coordinates that identify T with the real 3-space such that
the x-axis corresponds to log(sqrt(odds-ratio)) and margins vary on planes
x=const. We use these coordinates to visualise and compare measures of
association with respect to their dependence on the margins given the
odds-ratio, their limit behaviour when cells approach zero and their weighting
properties.
  We propose a novel measure of association in which tables with single small
entries are up-weighted but those with skewed margins are down-weighted
according to the relative entropy among the tables of the same odds-ratio.

(EMI) is performed when an electromotive force is generated in thin copper
turns, located inside a large magnetic coil. It has been established that the
electromotive force (emf) value should be dependent not only on changes of the
magnetic induction flux through a turn and on symmetry of its crossing by
magnetic power lines also. The law of EMI is applicable in sufficient
approximation in case of the changes of the magnetic field near the turn are
symmetrical. Experimental study of the induced emf in arcs and a direct section
of the conductor placed into the variable field has been carried out. Linear
dependence of the induced emf on the length of the arc has been ascertained in
case of the magnetic field distribution symmetry about it. Influence of the
magnetic field symmetry on the induced emf in the arc has been observed. The
curve of the induced emf in the direct section over period of current pulse is
similar to this one for the turns and arcs. The general law of EMI for a
curvilinear conductor has been deduced. Calculation of the induced emf in the
turns wrapped over it and comparison with the experimental data has been made.
The proportionality factor has been ascertained for the law. Special conditions
have been described, when the induced emf may not exist in the presence of
inductive current. Theoretical estimation of the inductive current has been
made at a induced low voltage in the turn. It has been noted the necessity to
take into account the concentration of current carriers in calculation of the
induced emf in semiconductors and ionized conductors.

a sequence of N heat reservoirs, with temperatures equally spaced between an
initial temperature T_0 and a final temperature T_N. The body and the heat
reservoirs are isolated from the rest of the universe, and the body is brought
in thermal contact successively with reservoirs of increasing temperature. We
determine the change of entropy of the composite thermodynamic system in the
total process in which the temperature of the body changes from T_0 to T_N. We
find that for large values of N the total change of entropy of the composite
process is proportional to (T_N-T_0)/N, but eventually a non-monotonic behavior
is found at small values of N.

capacity. Thanks to recent progress enabling a variety of optical transceivers
up to 40 Gb/s, many evolution possibilities to 200G PONs (passive optical

cases of evolution to 200G PON based on the combination of these improved
optical transceivers and WDM (wavelength division multiplexing). The physical
layer of the optical network has been simulated with OptiSystem software to
show the communication links performances behavior when considering key
components parameters in order to achieve good network design for a given area.
The complexity of the proposed architectures and financial cost comparisons are
also discussed.

Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations we solve self-consistently for the pair
correlation in rhombohedral (ABC) and Bernal (ABA) multilayer graphene by
considering a finite intrinsic s-wave pairing potential. We find that the two
different stacking configurations have opposite bulk/surface behavior for the
order parameter. Surface superconductivity is robust for ABC stacked multilayer
graphene even at very low pairing potentials for which the bulk order parameter
vanishes, in agreement with a recent analytical approach. In contrast, for
Bernal stacked multilayer graphene, we find that the order parameter is always
suppressed at the surface and that there exists a critical value for the
pairing potential below which no superconducting order is achieved. We
considered different doping scenarios and find that homogeneous doping strongly
suppresses surface superconductivity while non-homogeneous field-induced doping
has a much weaker effect on the superconducting order parameter. For multilayer
structures with hybrid stacking (ABC and ABA) we find that when the thickness
of each region is small (few layers), high-temperature surface
superconductivity survives throughout the bulk due to the proximity effect
between ABC/ABA interfaces where the order parameter is enhanced.

performance of the Xeon Phi coprocessor for SpMV. We first provide a
comprehensive introduction to this new architecture and analyze its peak
performance with a number of micro benchmarks. Although the design of a Xeon
Phi core is not much different than those of the cores in modern processors,
its large number of cores and hyperthreading capability allow many application
to saturate the available memory bandwidth, which is not the case for many
cutting-edge processors. Yet, our performance studies show that it is the
memory latency not the bandwidth which creates a bottleneck for SpMV on this

performance is very promising and even better than that of cutting-edge general

Nucleon-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus interactions are customarily $l$

reaction codes. The evidence for various forms of $l$ dependence of OMPs is
reviewed and the importance of implementing these forms is evaluated. Existing
arguments and evidence for $l$ dependence are reviewed and new arguments and
calculations are introduced. The relationship is examined between (i) $l$
dependence, and, (ii) the undularity (waviness) of $l$-independent potentials
that are $S$-matrix equivalent to $l$-dependent potentials. Such undularity is
a property of the dynamic polarisation potential (DPP) generated by the
coupling to reaction channels, or by coupling to excited states of the target
or projectile nuclei. Various examples, particularly involving weakly bound
projectile nuclei, are presented. Such undularity also occurs in
$l$-independent potentials that have been found in model independent fits to
precise wide angular range elastic scattering angular distributions. Cases of
such phenomenological undularity, for both light and heavy ions, are referenced
and shown to be related to undulatory properties of the dynamic polarisation
potentials (DPPs) arising from channel coupling. Other forms of $l$ dependence,
that could be standard options in direct reaction codes, are noted. Of
particular importance are $l$ dependencies arising from full
antisymmetrization. The case is made that reaction-induced $l$ dependence is a
general property of nucleon-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus interactions and

escape and reversion from cross-sectional data, which arises from the inherent
stochasticity in the evolutionary process. By application to empirical data, we
find that point estimates of rates from a previously published ODE model and
the integrated approach presented here are often similar, but can also differ
several-fold depending on the structure of the genealogy. The model-based

Yang-Mills-type gauge theory in a symmetry broken phase. In this picture the
gravity sector is described by an $SO(1,4)$ or $SO(2,3)$ gauge field
$A^{a}_{\phantom{a}b\mu}$ and Higgs field $V^{a}$ which acts to break the
symmetry down to that of the Lorentz group $SO(1,3)$. This symmetry breaking
mirrors that of electroweak theory. However, a notable difference is that while
the Higgs field $\Phi$ of electroweak theory is taken as a genuine dynamical
field satisfying a Klein-Gordon equation, the gauge independent norm $V^2\equiv
\eta_{ab}V^{a}V^{b}$ of the Higgs-type field $V^a$ is typically regarded as
non-dynamical. Instead, in many treatments $V^a$ does not appear explicitly in
the formalism or is required to satisfy $V^2 = \mathrm{const.} \neq 0$ by means
of a Lagrangian constraint. As an alternative to this we propose a class of
polynomial actions that treat both the gauge connection
$A^{a}_{\phantom{a}b\mu}$ and Higgs field $V^a$ as genuine dynamical fields
with no ad-hoc constraints imposed. The resultant equations of motion consist
of a set of first-order partial differential equations. We show that for
certain actions these equations may be cast in a second-order form,
corresponding to a scalar-tensor model of gravity. One simple choice leads to
the extensively studied Peebles-Ratra rolling quintessence model. Another
choice yields a scalar-tensor symmetry broken phase of the theory with positive
cosmological constant and an effective mass $M$ of the gravitational Higgs
field ensuring the constancy of $V^2$ at low energies and agreement with
empirical data if $M$ is sufficiently large. More general cases are discussed
corresponding to variants of Chern-Simons modified gravity and scalar-Euler
form gravity, each of which yield propagating torsion.

We develop a new algorithm that recovers the pre-collision state from the
post-collision state of the system, across a series of consecutive collisions,
with essentially no memory overhead. The challenge in achieving reversibility
for an n-particle collision (where, n << N) arises from the presence of nd-d-1
degrees of freedom during each collision, and from the complex geometrical
constraints placed on the colliding particles. To reverse the collisions in a
traditional simulation setting, all of the particular realizations of these
degrees of freedom during the forward simulation must be saved. This limitation
is addressed here by first performing a pseudo-randomization of angles,
ensuring determinism in the reverse path for any values of n and d. To address
the more difficult problem of geometrical and dynamic constraints, a new
approach is developed which correctly samples the constrained phase space. Upon
combining the pseudo-randomization with correct phase space sampling, perfect
reversibility of collisions is achieved, as illustrated for n <= 3, d=2, and
n=2, d=3 (and, in principle, generalizable to larger n). This result enables
for the first time reversible simulations of elastic collisions with
essentially zero memory accumulation. The reverse computation methodology
uncovers important issues of irreversibility in conventional models, and the
difficulties encountered in arriving at a reversible model for one of the most
basic physical system processes, namely, elastic collisions for hard spheres.
Insights and solution methodologies, with regard to accurate phase space
coverage with reversible random sampling proposed in this context, can help

extrapolate these relationships to lower and higher flare energies to estimate
the mass and energy loss due to CMEs from stellar coronae, assuming that the
observed X-ray emission of the latter is dominated by flares with a frequency
as a function of energy dn/dE=kE^-alpha. For solar-like stars at saturated
levels of X-ray activity, the implied losses depend fairly weakly on the
assumed value of alpha and are very large: M_dot ~ 5x10^-10 M_sun/yr and E_dot
~ 0.1L_sun. In order to avoid such large energy requirements, either the
relationships between CME mass and speed and flare energy must flatten for
X-ray fluence >~ 10^31 erg, or the flare-CME association must drop
significantly below 1 for more energetic events. If active coronae are
dominated by flares, then the total coronal energy budget is likely to be up to
an order of magnitude larger than the canonical 10^-3 L_bol X-ray saturation
threshold. This raises the question of what is the maximum energy a magnetic
dynamo can extract from a star? For an energy budget of 1% of L_bol, the CME
mass loss rate is about 5x10^-11 M_sun/yr.

force microscopy that probes the nonlinear tip-surface force by measurement of
the mixing of multiple tones in a frequency comb. A high $Q$ cantilever
resonance and a suitable drive comb will result in tip motion described by a
narrow-band frequency comb. We show by a separation of time scales, that such
motion is equivalent to rapid oscillations at the cantilever resonance with a
slow amplitude and phase or frequency modulation. With this time domain
perspective we analyze single oscillation cycles in ImAFM to extract the
Fourier components of the tip-surface force that are in-phase with tip motion
($F_I$) and quadrature to the motion ($F_Q$). Traditionally, these force
components have been considered as a function of the static probe height only.
Here we show that $F_I$ and $F_Q$ actually depend on both static probe height
and oscillation amplitude. We demonstrate on simulated data how to reconstruct
the amplitude dependence of $F_I$ and $F_Q$ from a single ImAFM measurement.
Furthermore, we introduce ImAFM approach measurements with which we reconstruct
the full amplitude and probe height dependence of the force components $F_I$
and $F_Q$, providing deeper insight into the tip-surface interaction. We
demonstrate the capabilities of ImAFM approach measurements on a polystyrene

0.01-percent per spectral channel. Both planets exhibit water absorption of
approximately 200 ppm at the water peak near 1.38 microns. Our result for XO-1b
contradicts the much larger absorption derived from NICMOS spectroscopy. The
weak water absorption we measure for HD209458b is reminiscent of the weakness
of sodium absorption in the first transmission spectroscopy of an exoplanet
atmosphere by Charbonneau et al. (2002). Model atmospheres having
uniformly-distributed extra opacity of 0.012 cm^2 per gram account
approximately for both our water measurement and the sodium absorption in this

spectrum that is dominated by continuous opacity due to haze and/or dust.
However, the extra opacity needed for HD209458b is grayer than for HD189733b,
with a weaker Rayleigh component.

important unresolved biological question. Unlike most candidate explanations,
this paper proposes that increasing evolvability can result without any
pressure to adapt. The insight is that if evolvability is heritable, then an
unbiased drifting process across genotypes can still create a distribution of
phenotypes biased towards evolvability, because evolvable organisms diffuse
more quickly through the space of possible phenotypes. Furthermore, because
phenotypic divergence often correlates with founding niches, niche founders may
on average be more evolvable, which through population growth provides a
genotypic bias towards evolvability. Interestingly, the combination of these
two mechanisms can lead to increasing evolvability without any pressure to
out-compete other organisms, as demonstrated through experiments with a series
of simulated models. Thus rather than from pressure to adapt, evolvability may
inevitably result from any drift through genotypic space combined with
evolution's passive tendency to accumulate niches.

fitness, i.e., genetic draft, dominate over genetic drift. As a result, neutral
genetic diversity depends weakly on population size, but strongly on the rate

that goes beyond the Standard Model of particle physics and Einstein's General
Relativity has received a great deal of interest in recent years. At the same
time, new experiments have been designed and conducted that are able to test
Lorentz symmetry at unprecedented levels. Much of this theoretical and
experimental progress has been driven by the development of the framework for
investigating Lorentz violation known as the Standard Model Extension (SME).
The SME is the lagrangian-based effective field theory that by definition
contains all Lorentz-violating interaction terms that can be written as
observer scalars involving particle fields in the Standard Model and
gravitational fields in a generalized theory of gravity. This includes all
terms that could arise from a process of spontaneous Lorentz violation as well
as terms that explicitly break Lorentz symmetry. In this article, an overview
of the SME is presented, including its motivations and construction. A very
useful minimal version of the SME in Minkowski spacetime that maintains gauge
invariance and power-counting renormalizability is constructed as well. Data
tables summarizing tests of local Lorentz invariance for the different particle
sectors in the Standard Model and with gravity are maintained by Kosteleck\'y's
group at Indiana University. A partial survey of these tests, including some of
the high-precision sensitivities they attain, is presented here.

neurons. Here, the task is to first memorize a set of patterns using a network
of neurons whose states assume values from a finite number of integer levels.
Later, the same network should be able to recall previously memorized patterns
from their noisy versions. Prior work in this area consider storing a finite
number of purely random patterns, and have shown that the pattern retrieval
capacities (maximum number of patterns that can be memorized) scale only
linearly with the number of neurons in the network.
  In our formulation of the problem, we concentrate on exploiting redundancy
and internal structure of the patterns in order to improve the pattern
retrieval capacity. Our first result shows that if the given patterns have a
suitable linear-algebraic structure, i.e. comprise a sub-space of the set of
all possible patterns, then the pattern retrieval capacity is in fact
exponential in terms of the number of neurons. The second result extends the
previous finding to cases where the patterns have weak minor components, i.e.
the smallest eigenvalues of the correlation matrix tend toward zero. We will
use these minor components (or the basis vectors of the pattern null space) to
both increase the pattern retrieval capacity and error correction capabilities.
  An iterative algorithm is proposed for the learning phase, and two simple
neural update algorithms are presented for the recall phase. Using analytical
results and simulations, we show that the proposed methods can tolerate a fair
amount of errors in the input while being able to memorize an exponentially
large number of patterns.

revealed in relation to other decentralized schemes even under left-stochastic
combination policies. First, closed-form expressions for the evolution of their
excess-risk are derived for strongly-convex risk functions under a diminishing
step-size rule. Second, using these results, it is shown that the diffusion
strategy improves the asymptotic convergence rate of the excess-risk relative
to non-cooperative schemes. Third, it is shown that when the in-network
cooperation rules are designed optimally, the performance of the diffusion
implementation can outperform that of naive centralized processing. Finally,
the arguments further show that diffusion outperforms consensus strategies
asymptotically, and that the asymptotic excess-risk expression is invariant to
the particular network topology. The framework adopted in this work studies
convergence in the stronger mean-square-error sense, rather than in
distribution, and develops tools that enable a close examination of the
differences between distributed strategies in terms of asymptotic behavior, as
well as in terms of convergence rates.

models to impact fission pathways of thorium and uranium isotopes. These
predictions have guided the interpretation of resonances seen experimentally.
On the other hand, self-consistent calculations consistently predict very
shallow potential-energy surfaces in the third minimum region. Purpose: We
investigate the interpretation of third-minimum configurations in terms of
dimolecular states. We study the isentropic potential-energy surfaces of
selected even-even thorium and uranium isotopes at several excitation energies.
In order to understand the driving effects behind the presence of third minima,
we study the interplay between pairing and shell effects. Methods: We use the
finite-temperature superfluid nuclear density functional theory. We consider a
traditional functional, SkM*, and a recent functional, UNEDF1, optimized for
fission studies. Results: We predict very shallow or no third minima in the
potential-energy surfaces of 232Th and 232U. In Th and U isotopes with N=136
and 138, the third minima are deeper. We show that the reflection-asymmetric
configurations around the third minimum can be associated with dimolecular
states involving the spherical doubly magic 132Sn and a lighter deformed Zr or
Mo fragment. The potential-energy surfaces for 228,232Th and 232U at several
excitation energies are presented. Conclusions: We show that the neutron shell
effect that governs the existence of the dimolecular states around the third
minimum is consistent with the spherical-to-deformed shape transition in the Zr
and Mo isotopes around N=58. We demonstrate that the thermal reduction of
pairing and enhancement of shell effects at small excitation energies help to
develop deeper third minima. At large excitation energies, shell effects are
washed out and third minima disappear altogether.

vector-control strategies on the Basic Reproduction Number and on the Force of
Infection of dengue. Each of the strategies was studied separately from the
others. The analysis presented allows us to conclude that of the available
vector control strategies, adulticide application is the most effective,
followed by the reduction of the exposure to mosquito bites, locating and
destroying breeding places and, finally, larvicides. Current vector-control
methods are concentrated in mechanical destruction of mosquitoes breeding
places. Our results suggest that reducing the contact between vector and hosts
(biting rates) are as efficient as the logistically difficult but very
efficient adult mosquitos control.

approach consists of three elements: (i) ab initio calculations of DNA, (ii)
Green's function approach for transport calculations, and (iii) the use of two
parameters to determine the decoherence rates. We first study the role of the
backbone. We find that the backbone can alter the coherent transmission
significantly at some energy points by interacting with the bases, though the
overall shape of the transmission stays similar for the two cases. More
importantly, we find that the coherent electrical conductance is tremendously
smaller than what the experiments measure. We consider DNA strands under a
variety of different experimental conditions and show that even in the most
ideal cases, the calculated coherent conductance is much smaller than the
experimental conductance. To understand the reasons for this, we carefully look
at the effect of decoherence. By including decoherence, we show that our model
can rationalize the measured conductance of the four strands, both
qualitatively and quantitatively. We find that the effect of decoherence on G:C
base pairs is crucial in getting agreement with the experiments. However, the
decoherence on G:C base pairs alone does not explain the experimental
conductance in strands containing a number of A:T base pairs. Including
decoherence on A:T base pairs is also essential. By fitting the experimental
trends and magnitudes in the conductance of the four different DNA molecules,
we estimate for the first time that the deocherence rate is 6 meV for G:C and
1.5 meV for A:T base pairs.

make statistical claims in entanglement verification experiments that are
reliable and have a clear interpretation. In this work, we apply recent results
by M. Christandl and R. Renner to construct a reliable entanglement
verification procedure based on the concept of confidence regions. The
statements made do not require the specification of a prior distribution, the
assumption of independent measurements nor the assumption of an independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) source of states. Moreover, we develop
numerical tools that are necessary to employ this approach in practice,

  scanner: application to the Rangitikei canyon (N-Z)",,,,,"physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Surveying techniques such as Terrestrial Laser Scanner have recently been
used to measure surface changes via 3D point cloud (PC) comparison. Two types
of approaches have been pursued: 3D tracking of homologous parts of the surface
to compute a displacement field, and distance calculation between two point
clouds when homologous parts cannot be defined. This study deals with the
second approach, typical of natural surfaces altered by erosion, sedimentation
or vegetation between surveys. Current comparison methods are based on a
closest point distance or require at least one of the PC to be meshed with
severe limitations when surfaces present roughness elements at all scales. We
introduce a new algorithm performing a direct comparison of point clouds in 3D.
Surface normals are first estimated in 3D at a scale consistent with the local
surface roughness. The measurement of the mean change along the normal
direction is then performed with an explicit calculation of a confidence
interval. Comparison with existing methods demonstrates the higher accuracy of
our approach, as well as an easier workflow due to the absence of surface
meshing or DEM generation. Application of the method in a rapidly eroding
meandering bedrock river (Rangitikei river canyon) illustrates its ability to
handle 3D differences in complex situations (flat and vertical surfaces on the
same scene), to reduce uncertainty related to point cloud roughness by local
averaging and to generate 3D maps of uncertainty levels. Combined with mm-range
local georeferencing of the point clouds, levels of detection down to 6 mm can
be routinely attained in situ over ranges of 50 m. We provide evidence for the
self-affine behavior of different surfaces. We show how this impacts the
calculation of normal vectors and demonstrate the scaling behavior of the level
of change detection.

departures from the growth in the LCDM model can be quantified in terms of two
functions of time and Fourier number k. We argue that in local theories of
gravity, in the quasi-static approximation, these functions must be ratios of
polynomials in k, with the numerator of one function being equal to the
denominator of the other. Moreover, the polynomials are even and of second
degree in practically all viable models considered today. This means that,
without significant loss of generality, one can use data to constraint only
five functions of a single variable, instead of two functions of two variables.
Furthermore, since the five functions are expected to be slowly varying, one
can fit them to data in a non-parametric way with the aid of an explicit
smoothness prior. We discuss practical application of this parametrization to
forecasts and fits.

associate progenitor galaxies with their descendants at lower redshifts. One
promising approach is to link galaxies at fixed number density, rather than
fixed luminosity or mass. This method is effective if stellar mass rank order
is broadly conserved through cosmic time. In this paper, we use the Guo et al.
(2011) semi-analytical model to analyze under what circumstances this
assumption is valid in the context of a cosmological simulation. Specifically,
we select progenitor galaxies at a constant number density and compare the
stellar mass evolution of their descendants to the evolution at a constant
number density. The median stellar mass of the descendants increases by a
factor of four (0.6 dex) from z = 3 to z = 0. Constant number density selection
reproduces this to within 40% (0.15 dex) over a wide range of number densities.
We show that the discrepancy primarily results from scatter in the stellar mass
growth rates and merging. After applying simple, observationally-based
corrections for these processes, the discrepancy is reduced to 12% (0.05 dex).
We conclude that number density selection can be used to predict the median
descendant mass of high-redshift progenitor galaxies. The main uncertainty in
this study is that semi-analytical models do not reproduce the observed mass
evolution of galaxies, which makes the quantitative aggregate effects of star
formation, merging, and quenching on the rank order of galaxies somewhat
uncertain.

submillimeter-selected galaxy SMM J04135+10277, using the Combined Array for
Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA). SMM J04135+10277 was previously
thought to be a gas-rich, submillimeter-selected quasar, with the highest
molecular gas mass among high-z quasars reported in the literature. Our maps at
~6x improved linear resolution relative to earlier observations spatially
resolve the emission on ~1.7"" scales, corresponding to a (lensing-corrected)
source radius of ~5.2 kpc. They also reveal that the molecular gas reservoir,
and thus, likely the submillimeter emission, is not associated with the host
galaxy of the quasar, but with an optically faint gas-rich galaxy at 5.2"", or
41.5 kpc projected distance from the active galactic nucleus (AGN). The
obscured gas-rich galaxy has a dynamical mass of M_dyn sin2(i)=5.6x10^11 M_sun,
corresponding to a gas mass fraction of ~21%. Assuming a typical M_BH/M* ratio
for z>2 quasars, the two galaxies in this system have an approximate mass ratio
of ~1.9. Our findings suggest that this quasar-starburst galaxy pair could
represent an early stage of a rare major, gas-rich/gas-poor (""wet-dry"") merger
of two massive galaxies at z=2.8, rather than a single, gas-rich AGN host
galaxy. Such systems could play an important role in the early buildup of
present-day massive galaxies through a submillimeter-luminous starburst phase,
and may remain hidden in larger numbers among rest-frame far-infrared-selected
quasar samples at low and high redshift.

Previous visible-wavelength spectra of this object show significant variability
across multiple epochs which could be the result of a compositionally
heterogeneous surface. We present new visible and near-infrared spectra to
demonstrate that thermally altered carbonaceous chondrites are plausible
compositional analogs, however this is a tentative association due to a lack of
any prominent absorption features in our data. We have also conducted a series
of high signal-to-noise visible-wavelength observations to investigate the
reported surface heterogeneity. Our time series of visible spectra do not show
evidence for variability at a precision level of a few percent. This result
suggests two most likely possibilities. One, that the surface of 1999 JU3 is
homogenous and that unaccounted for systematic effects are causing spectral
variation across epochs. Or two, that the surface of 1999 JU3 is regionally
heterogenous, in which case existing shape models suggest that any
heterogeneity must be limited to terrains smaller than approximately 5% of the
total surface area. These new observations represent the last opportunity
before both the launch and return of the Hayabusa II spacecraft to perform
ground-based characterization of this asteroid. Ultimately, these predictions
for composition and surface properties will be tested upon completion of the

short-baseline neutrino anomalies. In a neutrino-symmetric bath a ""thermal""
population of the sterile state would quickly grow, but in the presence of
primordial neutrino asymmetries a self-suppression as well as a resonant
sterile neutrino production can take place, depending on temperature and chosen
parameters. In order to characterize these effects, we go beyond the usual
average momentum and single mixing approximations and consider a multi-momentum
and multi-flavour treatment of the kinetic equations. We find that the
enhancement obtained in this case with respect to the average momentum
approximation is significant, up to \sim 20 % of a degree of freedom. Such
detailed and computationally demanding treatment further raises the asymmetry
values required to significantly suppress the sterile neutrino production, up
to large and preferentially net asymmetries |L_{\nu}| > O(10^{-2}). For such
asymmetries, however, the active-sterile flavour conversions happen so late
that significant distortions are produced in the electron (anti)neutrino
spectra. The larger |L_{\nu}|, the more the impact of these distortions takes
over as dominant cosmological effect, notably increasing the 4 He abundance in
primordial nucleosynthesis (BBN). The standard expression of the primordial
yields in terms of the effective number of neutrinos and asymmetries is also
greatly altered. We numerically estimate the magnitude of such effects for a
few representative cases and comment on possible implications for forthcoming
cosmological measurements.

to be common among galaxies in the so-called ""Green Valley"", a region of galaxy
color space believed to be composed mostly of galaxies undergoing
star-formation quenching. Combining the deepest current X-ray and Herschel.
PACS far-infrared (FIR) observations of the two Chandra Deep Fields (CDFs) with
redshifts, stellar masses and rest-frame photometry derived from the extensive

samples of inactive control galaxies. The UV-to-optical colors of AGNs are
consistent with equally massive inactive galaxies at redshifts out to z~2, but
we show that such colors are poor tracers of star formation. While the FIR
distributions of both star-forming AGNs and star-forming inactive galaxies are
statistically similar, we show that AGNs are preferentially found in
star-forming host galaxies, or, in other words, AGNs are less likely to be
found in weakly star-forming or quenched galaxies. We postulate that, among
X-ray selected AGNs of low and moderate accretion luminosities, the supply of
cold gas primarily determines the accretion rate distribution of the nuclear
black holes.

the Herschel Space Observatory and the LABOCA and SABOCA instruments on APEX as
part of the Herschel Orion Protostar Survey (HOPS). A total of 55 new protostar
candidates are detected at 70 um and 160 um that are either too faint (m24 > 7
mag) to be reliably classified as protostars or undetected in the Spitzer/MIPS
24 um band. We find that the 11 reddest protostar candidates with log (lambda
F_lambda 70) / (lambda F_lambda 24) > 1.65 are free of contamination and can
thus be reliably explained as protostars. The remaining 44 sources have less
extreme 70/24 colors, fainter 70 um fluxes, and higher levels of contamination.
Taking the previously known sample of Spitzer protostars and the new sample
together, we find 18 sources that have log (lambda F_lambda 70) / (lambda
F_lambda 24) > 1.65; we name these sources ""PACS Bright Red sources"", or PBRs.
Our analysis reveals that the PBRs sample is composed of Class 0 like sources
characterized by very red SEDs (T_bol < 45 K) and large values of
sub-millimeter fluxes (L_smm/L_bol > 0.6%). Modified black-body fits to the
SEDs provide lower limits to the envelope masses of 0.2 M_sun to 2 M_sun and
luminosities of 0.7 L_sun to 10 L_sun. Based on these properties, and a
comparison of the SEDs with radiative transfer models of protostars, we
conclude that the PBRs are most likely extreme Class 0 objects distinguished by
higher than typical envelope densities and hence, high mass infall rates.

is powered by dissipation from a steady-state r-mode. For masses $< 2
M_{\odot}$ we find dimensionless r-mode amplitudes in the range from about
$1\times 10^{-8}$ to $1.5\times 10^{-6}$. For the accreting millisecond X-ray
pulsar sources with known quiescent spin-down rates these limits suggest that
$\lesssim 1%$ of the observed rate can be due to an unstable r-mode.
Interestingly, the source with the highest amplitude limit, NGC 6440, could
have an r-mode spin-down rate comparable to the observed, quiescent rate for
SAX J1808-3658. Thus, quiescent spin-down measurements for this source would be
particularly interesting. For all sources considered here our amplitude limits
suggest that gravitational wave signals are likely too weak for detection with
Advanced LIGO. Our highest mass model ($2.21\, M_{\odot}$) can support
enhanced, direct Urca neutrino emission in the core and thus can have higher
r-mode amplitudes. Indeed, the inferred r-mode spin-down rates at these higher
amplitudes are inconsistent with the observed spin-down rates for some of the
sources, such as IGR J00291+5934 and XTE J1751-305. In the absence of other
significant sources of internal heat, these results could be used to place an
upper limit on the masses of these sources if they were made of hadronic
matter, or alternatively it could be used to probe the existence of exotic
matter in them if their masses were known.

from extragalactic sources is attenuated due to pair production in the
interaction with photons of the extragalactic background light (EBL). Depending
on the distance of the source, the Universe should be opaque to VHE photons
above a certain energy. However, indications exist that the Universe is more
transparent than previously thought. A recent statistical analysis of a large
sample of VHE spectra shows that the correction for absorption with current EBL
models is too strong for the data points with the highest attenuation. An
explanation might be the oscillation of VHE photons into hypothetical
axion-like particles (ALPs) in ambient magnetic fields. This mechanism would
decrease the opacity as ALPs propagate unimpeded over cosmological distances.
  Here, a large sample of VHE gamma-ray spectra obtained with imaging air
Cherenkov telescopes is used to set, for the first time, lower limits on the
photon-ALP coupling constant over a large range of ALP masses. The conversion
in different magnetic field configurations, including intra-cluster and

oscillations. For optimistic scenarios of the intervening magnetic fields, a
lower limit on the photon-ALP coupling of the order of
$10^{-12}\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ is obtained whereas more conservative model
assumptions result in $2\times10^{-11}\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$. The latter value is

decay mode is performed using 1.0/fb of data collected by the LHCb experiment
in 7 TeV center-of-mass energy pp collisions produced by the LHC. A modified
Dalitz plot analysis of the final state is performed using both the invariant
mass spectra and the decay angular distributions. Resonant structures are
observed in the K+K- mass spectrum as well as a significant non-resonant S-wave
contribution. The largest resonant component is the \phi(1020), accompanied by
f0(980), f'2(1525), and four additional resonances. The overall branching
fraction is measured to be B(Bs->J/\psi K+K-)=(7.70 +/-0.08 +/- 0.39 +/- 0.60)x
10^(-4), where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second systematic, and
the third due to the ratio of the number of Bs to B- mesons produced. The mass
and width of the f'2(1525) are measured to be 1522.2 +/- 2.8^{+5.3}_{-2.0} MeV
and 84 +/- 6^{+10}_{-5} MeV, respectively. The final state fractions of the
other resonant states are also reported.

motives. We start by extending the K-theory of endomorphisms functor from
ordinary rings to (stable) infinity categories. We then prove that this
extended functor KEnd(-) not only descends to the category of noncommutative
motives but moreover becomes co-represented by the noncommutative motive
associated to the tensor algebra S[t] of the sphere spectrum S. Using this
co-representability result, we then classify all the natural transformations of
KEnd(-) in terms of an integer plus a fraction between polynomials with
constant term 1; this solves a problem raised by Almkvist in the seventies.
Finally, making use of the multiplicative co-algebra structure of S[t], we
explain how the (rational) Witt vectors can also be recovered from the
symmetric monoidal category of noncommutative motives. Along the way we show
that the K_0-theory of endomorphisms of a connective ring spectrum R equals the
K_0-theory of endomorphisms of the underlying ordinary ring \pi_0(R).

untrusted non-regenerative relay to augment its direct transmission of a
confidential message to the destination. Since the relay is untrusted, it is
desirable to protect the confidential data from it while simultaneously making
use of it to increase the reliability of the transmission. We first examine the
secrecy outage probability (SOP) of the network assuming a single antenna
relay, and calculate the exact SOP for three different schemes: direct
transmission without using the relay, conventional non-regenerative relaying,
and cooperative jamming by the destination. Subsequently, we conduct an
asymptotic analysis of the SOPs to determine the optimal policies in different
operating regimes. We then generalize to the multi-antenna relay case and
investigate the impact of the number of relay antennas on the secrecy
performance. Finally, we study a scenario where the relay has only a single RF
chain which necessitates an antenna selection scheme, and we show that unlike
the case where all antennas are used, under certain conditions the cooperative
jamming scheme with antenna selection provides a diversity advantage for the
receiver. Numerical results are presented to verify the theoretical predictions
of the preferred transmission policies.

full NCSM calculations. We employ the Entem and Machleidt chiral two-body N3LO
interaction (regulated at 500 MeV/c), which has been modified to a phase-shift
equivalent potential by the similarity renormalization group (SRG) procedure.
We investigate the dependence of the procedure on the technique employed to
extrapolate to the complete Nmax space, the harmonic oscillator energy, and
investigate the dependence on the momentum-decoupling scale (\lambda) used in
the SRG. We also investigate the use of one or several reference states from
which the truncated basis is constructed. We find that the uncertainties
generated from various extrapolating functions used to extrapolate to the
complete Nmax space increase as Nmax increases. The extrapolation uncertainties
range from a few keV for the smallest Nmax spaces to about 50 keV for the
largest Nmax spaces. We note that the difference between extrapolated IT-NCSM
and NCSM ground-state energies, however, can be as large as a 100-250 keV

time, graphene is attractive for optoelectronics and photodetection
applications. However, the extraction of photoelectrons in conventional
metal-graphene junction devices is limited by their small junction area, where
the typical photoresponsivity is lower than 0.01 AW-1. On the other hand, the
atomically thin layer of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a two-dimensional (2d)
nanomaterial with a direct and finite band gap, offering the possibility of
acting as a 2d light absorber. The optoelectronic properties of the
heterostructure of these two films is therefore of great interest. The growth
of large-area graphene using chemical vapour deposition (CVD) has become mature
nowadays. However, the growth of large-area MoS2 monolayer is still
challenging. In this work, we show that a large-area and continuous MoS2
monolayer is achievable using a CVD method. Both graphene and MoS2 layers are
transferable onto desired substrates, making possible immediate and large-scale
optoelectronic applications. We demonstrate that a phototransistor based on the
graphene/MoS2 heterostructure is able to provide a high photoresponsivity
greater than 107 A/W while maintaining its ultrathin and planar structure. Our
experiments show that the electron-hole pairs are produced in the MoS2 layer
after light absorption and subsequently separated across the layers.
Contradictory to the expectation based on the conventional built-in electric
field model for metal-semiconductor contacts, photoelectrons are injected into
the graphene layer rather than trapped in MoS2 due to the alignment of the
graphene Fermi level with the conduction band of MoS2. The band alignment is
sensitive to the presence of a perpendicular electric field arising from, for
example, Coulomb impurities or an applied gate voltage, resulting in a tuneable
photoresponsivity.

estimating an embedded low-rank signal matrix? Principal component analysis
ascribes greater importance to the components that capture the greatest
variation, i.e., the singular vectors associated with the largest singular
values. This choice is often justified by invoking the Eckart-Young theorem
even though that work addresses the problem of how to best represent a
signal-plus-noise matrix using a low-rank approximation and not how to
best_infer_ the underlying low-rank signal component.
  Here we take a first-principles approach in which we start with a
signal-plus-noise data matrix and show how the spectrum of the noise-only
component governs whether the principal or the middle components of the
singular value decomposition of the data matrix will be the informative
components for inference. Simply put, if the noise spectrum is supported on a
connected interval, in a sense we make precise, then the use of the principal
components is justified. When the noise spectrum is supported on multiple
intervals, then the middle components might be more informative than the
principal components.
  The end result is a proper justification of the use of principal components
in the setting where the noise matrix is i.i.d. Gaussian and the identification
of scenarios, generically involving heterogeneous noise models such as mixtures
of Gaussians, where the middle components might be more informative than the
principal components so that they may be exploited to extract additional
processing gain. Our results show how the blind use of principal components can
lead to suboptimal or even faulty inference because of phase transitions that

onto dust grains in the primordial nebula and delivery through planetesimals
and planetary embryos have become more prominent. However, no sole source of
water provides a satisfactory explanation for Earth's water as a whole. In view
of that, using numerical simulations, we have developed a compound model
incorporating both the principal endogenous and exogenous theories, and
investigating their implications for terrestrial planet formation and
water-delivery. Comets are also considered in the final analysis, as it is
likely that at least some of Earth's water has cometary origin. We analyze our
results comparing two different water distribution models, and complement our
study using D/H ratio, finding possible relative contributions from each

field coupled with a barotropic fluid, the cosmological autonomous system has
five fixed points and one of them is stable if the adiabatic index $\gamma$
satisfies $0<\gamma<2$. This leads to the fact that the universe just have one
bounce point instead of the singularity which lies in the quantum dominated
area and it is caused by the quantum geometry effect. There are four fixed

newly discovered Fermi MSPs in the on-off gated image plane with an accuracy of
+-1"". Immediate knowledge of such precise position allows the use of sensitive
coherent beams of array telescopes for follow-up timing observations, which
substantially reduces the use of telescope time (~ 20X for the GMRT). In
addition, precise a-priori astrometric position reduces the effect of large
covariances in timing fit (with discovery position, pulsar period derivative
and unknown binary model), which in-turn accelerates the convergence to initial
timing model. For example, while fitting with precise a-priori position (+-1""),
timing model converges in about 100 days, accounting the effect of covariance
between position and pulsar period derivative. Moreover, such accurate
positions allows for rapid identification of pulsar counterpart at other

orbiting object that, at a given distance from its planet, is able to hold
itself together by self-gravity. It is directly related to the more familiar
""Roche limit,"" the distance from a planet at which a strengthless orbiting
object of given density is pulled apart by tides. The presence of a substantial
ring requires that transient clumps have an internal density less than
rho_Roche. Conversely, in the presence of abundant material for accretion, an
orbiting object with density greater than rho_Roche will grow.
  Comparing the rho_Roche values at which the Saturn and Uranus systems
transition rapidly from disruption-dominated (rings) to accretion-dominated
(moons), we infer that the material composing Uranus' rings is likely more
rocky, as well as less porous, than that composing Saturn's rings.
  From the high values of rho_Roche at the innermost ring-moons of Jupiter and
Neptune, we infer that those moons may be composed of denser material than
expected, or more likely that they are interlopers that formed farther from
their planets and have since migrated inward, now being held together by
internal material strength.
  Finally, the ""Portia group"" of eight closely-packed Uranian moons has an
overall surface density similar to that of Saturn's A ring. Thus, it can be
seen as an accretion-dominated ring system, of similar character to the
standard ring systems except that its material has a characteristic density
greater than the local rho_Roche.

masses. The model requires the following two key ingredients: (i) mass assembly
histories of central and satellite galaxies, and (ii) local observational
constraints of the star formation rates of central galaxies as function of halo
mass. We obtain a universal fitting formula that describes the (median) SFH of
central galaxies as function of halo mass, galaxy stellar mass and redshift. We
use this model to make predictions for various aspects of the star formation
rates of central galaxies across cosmic time. Our main findings are the
following. (1) The specific star formation rate (SSFR) at high $z$ increases
rapidly with increasing redshift [$\propto (1+z)^{2.5}$] for halos of a given
mass and only slowly with halo mass ($\propto M_h^{0.12}$) at a given $z$, in
almost perfect agreement with the specific mass accretion rate of dark matter
halos. (2) The ratio between the star formation rate (SFR) in the main-branch
progenitor and the final stellar mass of a galaxy peaks roughly at a constant
value, $\sim 10^{-9.3} h^2 {\rm yr}^{-1}$, independent of halo mass or the
final stellar mass of the galaxy. However, the redshift at which the SFR peaks
increases rapidly with halo mass. (3) More than half of the stars in the
present-day Universe were formed in halos with $10^{11.1}\msunh < M_h <
10^{12.3}\msunh$ in the redshift range $0.4 < z < 1.9$. (4) ... [abridged]

brane has a geometric tachyonic mode associated with displacement of the brane
along the circle. Cold inflationary scenario has been studied in connection
with this geometric tachyon \cite{PA1} where it was found that one needs a
background of minimum $10^4$ branes to realize a viable inflationary model. In
this piece of work, we have tried to study a model of inflation driven by this
geometric tachoyn in presence of radiation. We have found that compared to the
isentropic scenario, to satisfy the observational bounds, the number of
background branes required in this case reduces drastically and a viable model
can be obtained with even six to seven NS 5-branes in the background.In this

and observed that the concerned parameter lies well within the observation

conditions for cosmic rays, was unusual. The highest levels of galactic protons
were recorded at Earth in late 2009 in contrast to expectations. Proton spectra
observed for 2006 to 2009 from the PAMELA cosmic ray detector on-board the
Resurs-DK1 satellite are presented together with the solutions of a
comprehensive numerical model for the solar modulation of cosmic rays. The
model is used to determine what mechanisms were mainly responsible for the
modulation of protons during this period, and why the observed spectrum for
2009 was the highest ever recorded. From mid-2006 until December 2009 we find
that the spectra became significantly softer because increasingly more low
energy protons had reached Earth. To simulate this effect, the rigidity
dependence of the diffusion coefficients had to decrease significantly below ~3
GeV. The modulation minimum period of 2009 can thus be described as relatively
more ""diffusion dominated"" than previous solar minima. However, we illustrate
that drifts still had played a significant role but that the observable
modulation effects were not as well correlated with the waviness of the
heliospheric current sheet as before. Protons still experienced global gradient
and curvature drifts as the heliospheric magnetic field had decreased
significantly until the end of 2009, in contrast to the moderate decreases
observed during previous minimum periods. We conclude that all modulation
processes contributed to the observed increases in the proton spectra for this
period, exhibiting an intriguing interplay of these major mechanisms.

visible in AIA 304 \AA\ that shows curvatures on its surface with variable
cross-sections as well as enhanced brightness. These curvatures evolved and
thereafter smoothed out within a time-scale of a minute. The curved locations
on the flux tube exhibit a radial outward enhancement of the surface of about
1-2 Mm (factor of 2 larger than the original thickness of the flux tube) from
the equilibrium position. AIA 193 \AA\ snapshots also show the formation of
bright knots and narrow regions inbetween at the four locations as that of 304
\AA\ along the flux tube where plasma emission is larger compared to the

the narrow regions in < 60 s may be the morphological signature of the sausage
instability. We also find the flows of the confined plasma in these bright
knots along the field lines, which indicates the dynamicity of the flux tube

the closest (\mu = 29.04) and brightest (Bmax = 9.94 mag) SN Ia observed since
the advent of modern large scale programs for the intensive periodic followup
of supernovae. Both synthetic light curve measurements and spectral feature
analysis attest to the normality of SN 2011fe. There is very little evidence
for reddening in its host galaxy. The homogeneous calibration, intensive time
sampling, and high signal-to-noise ratio of the data set make it unique. Thus
it is ideal for studying the physics of SN Ia explosions in detail, and for
furthering the use of SNe Ia as standardizable candles for cosmology. Several
such applications are shown, from the creation of a bolometric light curve and
measurement of the 56Ni mass, to the simulation of detection thresholds for
unburned carbon, direct comparisons with other SNe Ia, and existing spectral

  and expanded prose",,,,"gr-qc math.PR q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Smolin (1992) proposed that the fine-tuning problem for parameters of the
Standard Model might be accounted for by a Darwinian process of universe
reproduction - Cosmological Natural Selection (CNS) - in which black holes give
rise to offspring universes with slightly altered parameters. The laws for
variation and inheritance of the parameters are also subject to CNS if
variation in transmission laws occurs. This is the strategy introduced by Nei
(1967) to understand genetic transmission, through the evolutionary theory of
modifier genes, whose methodology is adopted here. When mechanisms of variation
themselves vary, they are subject to Feldman's (1972) evolutionary Reduction
Principle that selection favors greater faithfulness of replication. A theorem
of Karlin (1982) allows one to generalize this principle beyond biological
genetics to the unknown inheritance laws that would operate in CNS. The
reduction principle for CNS is illustrated with a general multitype branching
process model of universe creation containing competing inheritance laws. The
most faithful inheritance law dominates the ensemble of universes. The
Reduction Principle thus provides a mechanism to account for high fidelity of
inheritance between universes. Moreover, it reveals that natural selection in
the presence of variation in inheritance mechanisms has two distinct objects:
maximization of both fitness and faithful inheritance. Tradeoffs between
fitness and faithfulness open the possibility that evolved fundamental
parameters are compromises, and not local optima to maximize universe
production, in which case their local non-optimality may point to their
involvement in the universe inheritance mechanisms.

clustering algorithm to the frequencies (y-values) on the smoothed histogram.
Hence, the frequencies of an image can be used instead of the conventional
whole data of image. The cluster that has the highest peak which represents the
maximum frequency in the image histogram will play as an excellent role in
determining a discerner cluster to the grey level image. Then, the pixels

This change of color SU(2) charges results in a rotation of the color vector
which is getting very fast at close partonic distances. The presence of this
non-Abelian additional term in the chromoelectric and chromomagnetic fields
creates a 'color charge glow', which is manifested as a distinct color wave
disturbance arising due to the finite distance at which the color interaction
becomes active. This situation may be relevant to the hadronization phase in
ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions, where the partonic state is governed by
strong local color fluctuations.

581 exoplanetary system. The system is known to harbour four planets (b-e). The
existence of another planet (g) in the liquid water habitable zone of the star
is debated after the latest analyses of the radial velocity (RV) measurements.
We integrated the 4 and 5-planet model of Vogt et al. (AN 333, 561-575, 2012)
with initial circular orbits. To characterize stability, the maximum
eccentricity was used that the planets reached over the time of the
integrations and the LCI and RLI to identify chaotic motion. Since circular
orbits in the RV fits seem to be a too strong restriction and the true orbits
might be elliptic, we investigated the stability of the planets as a function
of their eccentricity. The integration of the circular 4-planet model shows
that it is stable on a longer timescale for even an inclination i = 5{\deg}. A
fifth planetary body in the 4-planet model could have a stable orbit between
the two super-Earth sized planets c and d, and beyond the orbit of planet d,
although another planet would likely only be stable on circular or
near-circular orbit in the habitable zone of the star. Gliese 581 g in the
5-planet model would have a dynamically stable orbit, even for a wider range of
orbital parameters, but its stability is strongly dependent on the eccentricity
of planet d. The low-mass planet e, which quickly became unstable in eccentric
models, remains stable in the circular 4-planet model, but the stable region
around its initial semi-major axis and eccentricity is rather small. The
stability of the inner planets e and c is dependent on the eccentricity of the
Neptune-size planet b. The outermost planet d is far away from the adjacent
planet c to considerably influence its stability, however, the existence of a
planet between the two super-Earth planets c and d constrains its eccentricity.

adatoms on silicene, a graphene-like monolayer structure of silicon, are

interaction between the metal atoms and the silicene surface is quite strong
due to its highly reactive buckled hexagonal structure. In addition to
structural properties, we also calculate the electronic band dispersion, net
magnetic moment, charge transfer, workfunction and dipole moment of the metal
adsorbed silicene sheets. Alkali metals, Li, Na and K, adsorb to hollow site
without any lattice distortion. As a consequence of the significant charge
transfer from alkalis to silicene metalization of silicene takes place. Trends
directly related to atomic size, adsorption height, workfunction and dipole
moment of the silicene/alkali adatom system are also revealed. We found that
the adsorption of alkaline earth metals on silicene are entirely different from
their adsorption on graphene. The adsorption of Be, Mg and Ca turns silicene
into a narrow gap semiconductor. Adsorption characteristics of eight transition
metals Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Mo and W are also investigated. As a result of
their partially occupied d orbital, transition metals show diverse structural,
electronic and magnetic properties. Upon the adsorption of transition metals,
depending on the adatom type and atomic radius, the system can exhibit metal,
half-metal and semiconducting behavior. For all metal adsorbates the direction
of the charge transfer is from adsorbate to silicene, because of its high
surface reactivity. Our results indicate that the reactive crystal structure of
silicene provides a rich playground for functionalization at nanoscale.

affects the structure of the gas in most of our model clouds, creating large
and often well-cleared bubble structures and pillars. However, changes in the
structures of the embedded clusters produced are much weaker and not well
correlated to the evolution of the gas. We find that in all cases, star
formation efficiencies and rates are reduced by feedback and numbers of objects
increased, relative to control simulations. We find that local triggered star
formation does occur and that there is a good correlation between triggered
objects and pillars or bubble walls, but that triggered objects are often
spatially-mixed with those formed spontaneously. Some triggered objects acquire
large enough masses to become ionizing sources themselves, lending support to
the concept of propagating star formation. We find scant evidence for spatial
age gradients in most simulations, and where we do see them, they are not a
good indicator of triggering, as they apply equally to spontaneously-formed
objects as triggered ones. Overall, we conclude that inferring the global or
local effects of feedback on stellar populations from observing a system at a

here the parsec-scale Faraday Rotation distributions for the BL Lac objects
0716+714 and 1749+701, based on polarization data obtained with the Very Long
Baseline Array (VLBA) at two wavelengths near each of the 2cm, 4cm and 6cm
bands (0716+714) and at four wavelengths in the range 18-22 cm (1749+701). The
Rotation Measure (RM) maps for both these sources indicate systematic gradients
across their jets, as expected if these jets have helical B fields. The
significance of these transverse RM gradients is > 3 sigma in all cases. We
present the results of Monte Carlo simulations directly demonstrating the
possibility of observing such transverse RM gradients even if the intrinsic jet
structure is much narrower than the observing beam. We observe an intriguing
new feature in these sources, a reversal in the direction of the gradient in
the jet as compared to the gradient in the core region. This provides new
evidence to support models in which field lines emerging from the central
region of the accretion disk and closing in the outer region of the accretion
disk are both ""wound up"" by the differential rotation of the disk. The net
observed RM gradient will essentially be the sum effect of two regions of
helical field, one nested inside the other. The direction of the net RM
gradient will be determined by whether the inner or outer helix dominates the
RM integrated through the jet, and RM gradient reversals will be observed if
the inner and outer helical fields dominate in different regions of the jet.
This potentially provides new insights about the overall configuration of the
jet B fields.

event. Aims: By means of our interferometry observing campaign during this
outburst, supplemented by other observations, we investigate the temporal
evolution of the inner circumstellar structure of V1647 Ori We also study the
role of the changing extinction in the brightening of the object and separate
it from the accretional brightening. Methods: We observed V1647 Ori with
MIDI/VLTI at two epochs in this outburst. First, during the slowly fading
plateau phase (2005 March) and second, just before the rapid fading of the
object (2005 September), which ended the outburst. We used the radiative
transfer code MC3D to fit the interferometry data and the spectral energy
distributions from five different epochs at different stages of the outburst.
The comparison of these models allowed us to trace structural changes in the
system on AU-scales. We also considered qualitative alternatives for the
interpretation of our data. Results: We found that the disk and the envelope
are similar to those of non-eruptive young stars and that the accretion rate
varied during the outburst. We also found evidence for the increase of the
inner radii of the circumstellar disk and envelope at the beginning of the
outburst. Furthermore, the change of the interferometric visibilities indicates
structural changes in the circumstellar material. We test a few scenarios to
interpret these data. We also speculate that the changes are caused by the
fading of the central source, which is not immediately followed by the fading
of the outer regions. However, if the delay in the fading of the disk is
responsible for the changes seen in the MIDI data, the effect should be
confirmed by dynamical modeling.

equation is obtained for the crack face displacement of the reference crack.
Numerical results for the reflection and transmission coefficients are

quality and reduced reusability . Code clones are one of the most known bad
smells in source code. This design defect may occur in interfaces by
duplicating method/API declarations in several interfaces. Such interfaces are
similar from the point of view of public services/APIs they specify, thus they
indicate a bad organization of application services. In this paper, we
characterize the interface clone design defect and illustrate it via examples
taken from real-world open source software applications. We conduct an
empirical study covering nine real-world open source software applications to
quantify the presence of interface clones and evaluate their impact on
interface design quality . The results of the empirical study show that
interface clones are widely present in software interfaces. They also show that
the presence of interface clones may cause a degradation of interface cohesion
and indicate a considerable presence of code clones at implementations level.

galaxy encounters (merging and fly-by kind) during their merging histories. We

  tables",,"10.1007/JHEP06(2013)010",,"hep-ph hep-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the unknown parameters in neutrino oscillations is the octant of the
mixing angle theta_{23}. In this paper, we discuss the possibility of
determining the octant of theta_{23} in the long baseline experiments T2K and
NOvA in conjunction with future atmospheric neutrino detectors, in light of
non-zero value of theta_{13} measured by reactor experiments. We consider two
detector technologies for atmospheric neutrinos - magnetized iron calorimeter
and non-magnetized Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber. We present the octant
sensitivity for T2K/NOvA and atmospheric neutrino experiments separately as
well as combined. For the long baseline experiments, a precise measurement of
theta_{13}, which can exclude degenerate solutions in the wrong octant,
increases the sensitivity drastically. For theta_{23} = 39^o and sin^2 2
theta_{13} = 0.1, at least ~2 sigma sensitivity can be achieved by T2K+NOvA for
all values of delta_{CP} for both normal and inverted hierarchy. For
atmospheric neutrinos, the moderately large value of theta_{13} measured in the
reactor experiments is conducive to octant sensitivity because of enhanced
matter effects. A magnetized iron detector can give a 2 sigma octant
sensitivity for 500 kT yr exposure for theta_{23} = 39^o, delta_{CP} = 0 and
normal hierarchy. This increases to 3 sigma for both hierarchies by combining
with T2K+NOvA. This is due to a preference of different theta_{23} values at
the minimum chi^2 by T2K/NOvA and atmospheric neutrino experiments. A Liquid
Argon detector for atmospheric neutrinos with the same exposure can give higher
octant sensitivity, due to the interplay of muon and electron contributions and
superior resolutions. We obtain a ~3 sigma sensitivity for theta_{23} = 39^o
for normal hierarchy. This increases to > ~4 sigma for all values of delta_{CP}
if combined with T2K+NOvA. For inverted hierarchy the combined sensitivity is
~3 sigma.

central optical depth due to dust, \tau^f_B, and the stellar mass surface
density, \mu_{*}, of nearby (z < 0.13) spiral galaxies: log(\tau^f_B) =
1.12(+-0.11)log(\mu_{*}/M_sol kpc^2)-8.6(+-0.8). This relation was derived from
a sample of spiral galaxies taken from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA)
survey and detected in the FIR/submm in the Herschel-ATLAS survey. Using a
quantitative analysis of the NUV attenuation-inclination relation for complete
samples of GAMA spirals categorized according to \mu_{*} we demonstrate that
this correlation can be used to statistically correct for dust attenuation
purely on the basis of optical photometry and S'ersic-profile morphological
fits. Considered together with previously established empirical relationships
between stellar mass, metallicity and gas mass, the near linearity and high
constant of proportionality of the \tau^f_B-\mu_{*} relation disfavors a
stellar origin for the bulk of refractory grains in spiral galaxies, instead
being consistent with the existence of a ubiquitous and very rapid mechanism
for the growth of dust in the ISM. We use the \tau^f_B-\mu_{*} relation in
conjunction with the radiation transfer model for spiral galaxies of Popescu &
Tuffs (2011) to derive intrinsic scaling relations between specific star
formation rate (sSFR), stellar mass, and \mu_{*}, in which the attenuation of
the UV light used to measure the SFR is corrected on an object-to-object basis.
A marked reduction in scatter in these relations is achieved which is
demonstrably due to correction of both the inclination-dependent and face-on
components of attenuation. Our results are consistent with a picture of spiral
galaxies in which most of the submm emission originates from grains residing in
translucent structures, exposed to UV in the diffuse interstellar radiation
field.

low-dimensional flexible systems in a space of higher dimension, is pursued in
many fields from string theory to chemistry and biology. The case of a
two-dimensional (2D) membrane in three dimensions is the relevant one for
dealing with real materials. Traditionally, membranes are primarily discussed
in the context of biological membranes and soft matter in general. The
complexity of these systems hindered a realistic description of their
interatomic structures based on a truly microscopic approach. Therefore,
theories of membranes were developed mostly within phenomenological models.
From the point of view of statistical mechanics, membranes at finite
temperature are systems governed by interacting long-range fluctuations.
Graphene, the first truly two-dimensional system consisting of just one layer
of carbon atoms, provides a model system for the development of a microscopic
description of membranes. In this Account, we review key results in the
microscopic theory of structural and thermal properties of graphene and compare
them with the predictions of phenomenological theories. The two approaches are
in good agreement for the various scaling properties of correlation functions
of atomic displacements. However, some other properties, such as the
temperature dependence of the bending rigidity, cannot be understood based on
phenomenological approaches. We also consider graphene at very high temperature
and compare the results with existing models for two-dimensional melting. The
melting of graphene presents a different scenario, and we describe that process
as the decomposition of the graphene layer into entangled carbon chains.

by the presence of dust. Its observation is then a potentially valuable
diagnostic of dust attenuation, particularly at high-redshift where other
diagnostics are currently inaccesible. Interpreting the observed UV continuum
slope in the context of dust attenuation is often achieved assuming the
empirically calibrated Meurer et al. (1999) relation. Implicit in this relation
is the assumption of an intrinsic UV continuum slope ($\beta=-2.23$). However,
results from numerical simulations suggest that the intrinsic UV continuum
slopes of high-redshift star forming galaxies are bluer than this, and moreover
vary with redshift. Using values of the intrinsic slope predicted by numerical
models of galaxy formation combined with a Calzetti et al. (2000) reddening law
we infer UV attenuations ($A_{1500}$) $0.35-0.5\,{\rm mag}$ ($A_{V}$:
$0.14-0.2\,{\rm mag}$ assuming Calzetti et al. 2000) greater than simply
assuming the Meurer relation. This has significant implications for the
inferred amount of dust attenuation at very-high ($z\approx 7$) redshift given
current observational constraints on $\beta$, combined with the Meurer
relation, suggest dust attenuation to be virtually zero in all but the most
luminous systems.

Downsizing (TD) theory for planet formation play a very important role for the
evolution of accretion discs hosting them. Since all TD protoplanets are
initially as massive as $\sim 10$ Jupiter masses, they are able to open very
deep gaps in their discs, and even completely isolate the inner disc flows from
the outer ones. Furthermore, in contrast to other planet formation theories, TD
protoplanets are mass donors for their protostars. One potentially observable
signature of planets being devoured by their protostars are FU Ori like
outbursts, and episodic protostar accretion more generally, as discussed by a
number of authors recently.
  Here we explore another observational implication of TD hypothesis: dust poor
inner accretion flows, which we believe may be relevant to some of the observed
mm-bright transitional discs around protostars. In our model, a massive
protoplanet interrupts the flow of the outer dust-rich disc on its protostar,
and at the same time looses a part of its dust-poor envelope into the inner
disc. This then powers the observed gas-but-no-dust accretion onto the star.
Upon a more detailed investigation, we find that this scenario is quite natural
for young massive discs but is less so for older discs, e.g., those whose
self-gravitating phase has terminated a fraction of a Million year or more ago.
This stems from the fact that TD protoplanets of such an age should have
contracted significantly, and so are unlikely to loose much mass. Therefore, we
conclude that either (i) the population of ""transition discs"" with large holes
and dust-poor accretion is much younger than generally believed; or (ii) there
is a poorly understood stage for late removal of dust-poor envelopes from TD
planets; (iii) another explanation for the observations is correct.

in laser driven molecular systems applying a specifically chosen positively

entirely different final vibrational states. This phenomenon occurs when the
laser frequency and intensity are slowly varied around an exceptional point

a positively chirped laser pulse traces a counter-clockwise loop in time in the

power control where secondary users are allowed to use wireless resources of
the primary users when primary users are deactivated, but also allow secondary
users to coexist with primary users while primary users are activated by
managing interference caused from secondary users to primary users. Therefore,
a novel finite horizon adaptive optimal distributed power allocation scheme is
proposed by incorporating the effect of channel uncertainties for enhanced
cognitive radio network in the presence of wireless channel uncertainties under
two cases. In Case 1, proposed scheme can force the Signal-to-interference
(SIR) of the secondary users to converge to a higher target value for
increasing network throughput when primary users' are not communicating within
finite horizon. Once primary users are activated as in the Case 2, proposed
scheme can not only force the SIR of primary users to converge to a higher
target SIR, but also force the SIR of secondary users to converge to a lower
value for regulating their interference to Pus during finite time period. In
order to mitigate the attenuation of SIR due to channel uncertainties the
proposed novel finite horizon adaptive optimal distributed power allocation
allows the SIR of both primary users' and secondary users' to converge to a
desired target SIR while minimizing the energy consumption within finite
horizon. Simulation results illustrate that this novel finite horizon adaptive
optimal distributed power allocation scheme can converge much faster and cost
less energy than others by adapting to the channel variations optimally.

Following Hassett, we say that such a fourfold is special if it contains a

Special fourfolds correspond to a countable union of hypersurfaces in the

calculate the chemical evolution using an extended gas-grain network with
UV/X-ray-driven processes surface reactions, 3) a module to calculate the gas
thermal energy balance, and 4) a 1+1D module that simulates dust grain
evolution. For the first time, grain evolution and time-dependent molecular
chemistry are included in a protoplanetary disk model. We find that grain
growth and sedimentation of large grains to the disk midplane lead to a
dust-depleted atmosphere. Consequently, dust and gas temperatures become higher
in the inner disk (R < 50 AU) and lower in the outer disk (R > 50 AU), in
comparison with the disk model with pristine dust. The response of disk
chemical structure to the dust growth and sedimentation is twofold. First, due
to higher transparency a partly UV-shielded molecular layer is shifted closer
to the dense midplane. Second, the presence of big grains in the disk midplane
delays the freeze-out of volatile gas-phase species such as CO there, while in
adjacent upper layers the depletion is still effective. Molecular
concentrations and thus column densities of many species are enhanced in the
disk model with dust evolution, e.g., CO2, NH2CN, HNO, H2O, HCOOH, HCN, CO. We
also show that time-dependent chemistry is important for a proper description
of gas thermal balance.

vapor from the outer disk, where most of water ice reservoir is stored, was

Herschel/HIFI observations of the young TTS DG Tau in the ortho- and para-
water ground-state transitions at 557, 1113 GHz. The lines show a narrow
double-peaked profile, consistent with an origin in the outer disk, and are
~19-26 times brighter than in TW Hya. In contrast, CO and [C II] lines are
dominated by emission from the envelope/outflow, which makes H2O lines a unique
tracer of the disk of DG Tau. Disk modeling with the thermo-chemical code
ProDiMo indicates that the strong UV field, due to the young age and strong
accretion of DG Tau, irradiates a disk upper layer at 10-90 AU from the star,
heating it up to temperatures of 600 K and producing the observed bright water
lines. The models suggest a disk mass of 0.015-0.1 Msun, consistent with the
estimated minimum mass of the solar nebula before planet formation, and a water
reservoir of ~1e2-1e3 Earth oceans in vapour, and ~100 times larger in the form
of ice. Hence, this detection supports the scenario of ocean delivery on
terrestrial planets by impact of icy bodies forming in the outer disk.

the more traditional batch learning, where a pre-accumulated set of samples is

framework for planning and decision making. Applying the framework typically
requires elicitation of some form of probability and utility information. While
much work in AI has focused on providing representations and tools for
elicitation of probabilities, relatively little work has addressed the
elicitation of utility models. This imbalance is not particularly justified
considering that probability models are relatively stable across problem
instances, while utility models may be different for each instance. Spending
large amounts of time on elicitation can be undesirable for interactive systems
used in low-stakes decision making and in time-critical decision making. In
this paper we investigate the issues of reasoning with incomplete utility
models. We identify patterns of problem instances where plans can be proved to
be suboptimal if the (unknown) utility function satisfies certain conditions.
We present an approach to planning and decision making that performs the
utility elicitation incrementally and in a way that is informed by the domain
model.

Bayesian regression/classification (BRC) models, that can be factored into

convenient, because the conditional model (the portion of the full model that
we care about) can be analyzed by itself. We examine the practice of
transforming arbitrary Bayesian models to BRC models, and argue that this
practice is often inappropriate because it ignores prior knowledge that may be
important for learning. In addition, we examine Bayesian methods for learning
models from data. We discuss two criteria for Bayesian model selection that are
appropriate for repression/classification: one described by Spiegelhalter et
al. (1993), and another by Buntine (1993). We contrast these two criteria using
the prequential framework of Dawid (1984), and give sufficient conditions under

minimizes the distortion on the data and EM maximizes the likelihood, little is
known about the systematic differences of behavior between the two algorithms.
Here we shed light on these differences via an information-theoretic analysis.
The cornerstone of our results is a simple decomposition of the expected

parametric densities from unlabeled sample data) must implicitly manage a
trade-off between how similar the data assigned to each cluster are, and how
the data are balanced among the clusters. How well the data are balanced is
measured by the entropy of the partition defined by the hard assignments. In
addition to letting us predict and verify systematic differences between
K-means and EM on specific examples, the decomposition allows us to give a
rather general argument showing that K ?means will consistently find densities
with less ""overlap"" than EM. We also study a third natural assignment method

Classes also support inheritance of model fragments from a class to a subclass,
allowing the common aspects of related classes to be defined only once. Our
language has clear declarative semantics: an OOBN can be interpreted as a
stochastic functional program, so that it uniquely specifies a probabilistic
model. We provide an inference algorithm for OOBNs, and show that much of the

variables within an object and the reuse of model fragments in different
contexts--can also be used to speed up the inference process.

capture the novel senses of conditional utility and utility independence.
Finally, we present the notion of utility networks, which do for utilities what
Bayesian networks do for probabilities. Specifically, utility networks exploit
the new interpretation of conditional utility and utility independence to
compactly represent a utility distribution.

default rules that are presumed to work in all or most circumstances. We need
to take into account the importance of the context which is continuously
evolving during the reasoning process. Sequential thresholding is a
quantitative counterpart of default logic which makes explicit the role context
plays in the construction of a non-monotonic extension. We present a semantic
characterization of generic non-monotonic reasoning, as well as the
instantiations pertaining to default logic and sequential thresholding. This
provides a link between the two mechanisms as well as a way to integrate the
two that can be beneficial to both.

concerning probabilistic expert systems based on Bayesian networks. This paper
defines a version of these models, denoted as recursive exponential models,
which have evolved by the desire to impose sophisticated domain knowledge onto
local fragments of a model. Besides the structural knowledge, as specified by a
given model, the statistical modelling may also include expert opinion about
the values of parameters in the model. It is shown how to translate imprecise
expert knowledge into approximately conjugate prior distributions. Based on
possibly incomplete data, the score and the observed information are derived
for these models. This accounts for both the traditional score and observed
information, derived as derivatives of the log-likelihood, and the posterior
score and observed information, derived as derivatives of the log-posterior
distribution. Throughout the paper the specialization into recursive graphical
models is accounted for by a simple example.

  parallelization of multi-dimensional FFTs","24 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.NA cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The fast Fourier transform (FFT) is undoubtedly an essential primitive that
has been applied in various fields of science and engineering. In this paper,
we present a decomposition method for parallelization of multi-dimensional FFTs
with smallest communication amount for all ranges of the number of processes
compared to previously proposed methods. This is achieved by two distinguishing
features: adaptive decomposition and transpose order awareness. In the proposed
method, the FFT data are decomposed based on a row-wise basis that maps the
multi-dimensional data into one-dimensional data, and translates the
corresponding coordinates from multi-dimensions into one-dimension so that the
resultant one-dimensional data can be divided and allocated equally to the
processes. As a result, differently from previous works that have the
dimensions of decomposition pre-defined, our method can adaptively decompose
the FFT data on the lowest possible dimensions depending on the number of
processes. In addition, this row-wise decomposition provides plenty of
alternatives in data transpose, and different transpose order results in
different amount of communication. We identify the best transpose orders with
smallest communication amounts for the 3-D, 4-D, and 5-D FFTs by analyzing all
possible cases. Given both communication efficiency and scalability, our method
is promising in development of highly efficient parallel packages for the FFT.

evidences of resurfacing. It is accepted since 20 years (e.g. Tittemore and
Wisdom 1989, Malhotra and Dermott 1990) that this inclination is due to the
past trapping into the 3:1 resonance with Umbriel. These last years there is a
renewal of interest for the Uranian system since the Hubble Space Telescope
permitted the detection of an inner system of rings and small embedded
satellites, their dynamics being of course ruled by the main satellites. For
this reason, we here propose to revisit the long-term dynamics of Miranda,
using modern tools like intensive computing facilities and new chaos indicators
(MEGNO and frequency map analysis). As in the previous studies, we find the
resonance responsible for the inclination of Miranda and the secondary
resonances associated, likely to have stopped the rise of Miranda's inclination
at 4.5{\deg}. Moreover, we get other trajectories in which this inclination
reaches 7{\deg}. We also propose an analytical study of the secondary
resonances associated, based on the study by Moons and Henrard (1993).

boosted radiation from the jet, emission from the accretion disk, the broad

previously applied to radio and X-ray surveys, to the gamma-ray band and,
through detailed Monte Carlo simulations, compare our predictions to Fermi-LAT

observational results, including the percentages of BL Lacs and FSRQs, the

gamma-ray spectral index distributions. The strength and large scatter of the
oft-debated observed Gamma-ray -- radio flux density correlation is also
reproduced. In addition, we predict that almost 3/4 of Fermi-LAT BL Lacs, and
basically all of those without redshift determination, are actually FSRQs with
their emission lines swamped by the non-thermal continuum and as such should be
considered. Finally, several of the currently unassociated high Galactic

nonlinear magnetic-pressure gradient acts upon the medium (the ponderomotive
force). We investigate the nature of such a force in inhomogeneous 2.5D MHD
plasmas by analysing source terms in the nonlinear wave equations for the
general case of inhomogeneous B and {\rho}, and consider supporting nonlinear
numerical simulations. Our equations indicate there are two distinct classes of
ponderomotive effect induced by Alfven waves in general 2.5D MHD, each with
both a longitudinal and transverse manifestation; i) Geometric Effects:
Gradients in the pulse geometry relative to the background magnetic field cause
the wave to sustain cospatial disturbances, the longitudinal and transverse
daughter disturbances - where we report on the transverse disturbance for the
first time. ii) Grad (c_A) Effects: Where a pulse propagates through an
inhomogeneous region (where the non-zero gradients in the Alfven-speed profile
are non-zero), the nonlinear magnetic-pressure gradient acts to accelerate the
plasma. Transverse gradients (phase mixing regions) excite independently
propagating fast magnetoacoustic waves (generalising the result of Nakariakov
et al. 1997, Solar Physics, 175, 93) and longitudinal gradients perturb along
the field (thus creating static disturbances in {\beta} = 0, and slow waves in
{\beta} \= 0).
  We additionally demonstrate that mode conversion due the nonlinear Lorentz
force is a one-way process, and does not act as a mechanism to nonlinearly
generate Alfven waves due to propagating magnetoacoustic waves. We conclude
that these ponderomotive effects are induced by an Alfven wave propagating in
any MHD medium, and have the potential to have significant consequences on the
dynamics of energy transport and aspects of dissipation provided the system is
sufficiently nonlinear and inhomogeneous.

intense episodes of enhanced gamma-ray emission that we call ""waves"".

by themselves or in association with shorter flares. We present a refined flux
and spectral analysis of the Sept. - Oct. 2007 gamma-ray enhancement episode
detected by AGILE that shows both ""wave"" and flaring behavior. We extend our
analysis to the publicly available Fermi-LAT dataset and show that several
additional ""wave"" episodes can be identified. We discuss the spectral
properties of the September 2007 ""wave""/flare event and show that the physical

Plasma instabilities inducing ""waves"" appear to involve spatial distances l

Typically, the deduced total energy associated with the ""wave"" phenomenon (E_w

comparable with that associated to the flares, and can reach a few percent of

at large forward/backward photon pseudorapidities, close to the
pseudorapidities of scattered protons. In contrast, the photon-pomeron
(pomeron-photon) mechanism dominates at midrapidities but the related cross
section is rather small. In comparison the virtual-omega rescattering mechanism
contributes at smaller angles of photons (larger photon rapidities). Photons in
the forward/backward region can be measured by the Zero Degree Calorimeters
(ZDCs) installed in experiments at the LHC while the midrapidity photons are
difficult to measure (small cross section, small photon transverse momenta).
Protons could be measured by ALFA detector (ATLAS) or TOTEM detector at CMS.

Low mass local tadpoles were identified and studied photometrically in a
previous work, which we complete here analyzing their chemical and dynamical
properties. We measure Halpha velocity curves of seven local tadpoles,
representing 50% of the initial sample. Five of them show evidence for rotation
(sim 70%), and a sixth target hints at it. Often the center of rotation is
spatially offset with respect to the tadpole head (3 out of 5 cases). The size
and velocity dispersion of the heads are typical of giant HII regions, and
three of them yield dynamical masses in fair agreement with their stellar
masses as inferred from photometry. In four cases the velocity dispersion at
the head is reduced with respect to its immediate surroundings. The oxygen
metallicity estimated from [NII]6583/Halpha often shows significant spatial
variations across the galaxies (sim 0.5 dex), being smallest at the head and
larger elsewhere. The resulting chemical abundance gradients are opposite to
the ones observed in local spirals, but agrees with disk galaxies at high
redshift. We interpret the metallicity variation as a sign of external gas
accretion (cold-flows) onto the head of the tadpole. The galaxies are low
metallicity outliers of the mass-metallicity relationship. In particular, two
of the tadpole heads are extremely metal poor, with a metallicity smaller than
a tenth of the solar value. These two targets are also very young (ages smaller
than 5 Myr). All these results combined are consistent with the local tadpole
galaxies being disks in early stages of assembling, with their star formation
sustained by accretion of external metal poor gas.

the estimation of LTIR. We find that using data up to 250 um leads to local
LTIR values consistent with those obtained with a complete coverage (up to 500
um) within 10 per cent for most of our resolved elements. We then study the
distribution of energy in the resolved SEDs of our galaxies. The bulk of energy
(30-50 per cent) is contained in the (70-160 um) band. The (24-70 um) fraction
decreases with increasing metallicity. The (160-1100 um) submillimeter band can
account for up to 25 per cent of the LTIR in metal-rich galaxies. We
investigate the correlation between TIR surface brightnesses/luminosities and
monochromatic Spitzer and Herschel surface brightnesses/luminosities. The three
PACS bands can be used as reliable monochromatic estimators of the LTIR, the
100 um band being the most reliable monochromatic tracer. There is also a
strong correlation between the SPIRE 250um and LTIR, although with more scatter

$D'$ produces cycloidal harmonics that split $\Psi_1 $ and activate $\Phi_2$.

revealing latent factors that underlie sets of measurements or signals. It has
become a standard technique in functional neuroimaging. In functional
neuroimaging, so called group ICA (gICA) seeks to identify and quantify
networks of correlated regions across subjects. This paper reports on the
development of a new group ICA approach, Homotopic Group ICA (H-gICA), for
blind source separation of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) data. Resting state brain functional homotopy is the similarity of
spontaneous fluctuations between bilaterally symmetrically opposing regions
(i.e. those symmetric with respect to the mid-sagittal plane) (Zuo et al.,
2010). The approach we proposed improves network estimates by leveraging this
known brain functional homotopy. H-gICA increases the potential for network
discovery, effectively by averaging information across hemispheres. It is
theoretically proven to be identical to standard group ICA when the true
sources are both perfectly homotopic and noise-free, while simulation studies
and data explorations demonstrate its benefits in the presence of noise.
Moreover, compared to commonly applied group ICA algorithms, the structure of
the H-gICA input data leads to significant improvement in computational
efficiency. A simulation study comfirms its effectiveness in homotopic,
non-homotopic and mixed settings, as well as on the landmark ADHD-200 dataset.
From a relatively small subset of data, several brain networks were found
including: the visual, the default mode and auditory networks, as well as
others. These were shown to be more contiguous and clearly delineated than the
corresponding ordinary group ICA. Finally, in addition to improving network
estimation, H-gICA facilitates the investigation of functional homotopy via
ICA-based networks.

significantly larger than that expected from observational errors, accurately
quantified by means of extensive artificial stars experiments, (b) the

mapping (and more recently large-scale network studies) for decades. The
variety of citation behavior across scientific fields is both a research topic
in sociology of science, and a problem in scientific evaluation. Normalization,
tantamount to a particular weighting of links in the citation network, is
necessary for allowing across-field comparisons of citation scores and
interdisciplinary studies. In addition to classical normalization which
drastically reduces all variability factors altogether, two tracks of research
have emerged in the recent years. One is the revival of iterative ""influence
measures"". The second is the ""citing-side"" normalization, whose only purpose is
to control for the main factor of variability, the inequality in citing
propensity, letting other aspects play: knowledge export/imports and growth.
When all variables are defined at the same field-level, two propositions are
established: (a) the gross impact measure identifies with the product of
relative growth rate, gross balance of citation exchanges, and relative number
of references (b) the normalized impact identifies with the product of relative
growth rate and normalized balance. At the science level, the variance of
growth rate over domains is a proxy for change in the system, and the variance
of balance a measure of inter-disciplinary dependences. This opens a new
perspective, where the resulting variance of normalized impact, and a related
measure, the sum of these variances proposed as a Change-Exchange Indicator,
summarize important aspects of science structure and dynamism. Results based on
a decade's data are discussed. The behavior of normalized impact according to
scale changes is also briefly discussed.

has to be normalized, and (ii) the factorization rank has to be known in
advance. In this paper, we generalize Hottopixx in order to resolve these two
drawbacks, that is, we propose a new LP model which does not require
normalization and detects the factorization rank automatically. Moreover, the
new LP model is more flexible, significantly more tolerant to noise, and can
easily be adapted to handle outliers and other noise models. Finally, we show
on several synthetic datasets that it outperforms Hottopixx while competing
favorably with two state-of-the-art methods.

$\widetilde{\Theta}(T^{2/3})$. Interestingly, this rate is significantly worse

full-information case. Via a novel reduction from experts to bandits, we also
show that a bounded memory adversary can force $\widetilde{\Theta}(T^{2/3})$

easier to control than bounded memory adversaries. Our lower bounds rely on a

Statistical properties such as moment generation and characteristic functions,
moments and variance-covariance matrix are provided. The marginal and

which extends the bivariate L\'evy motion proposed by Kozubowski et al. (2008).

processes and we named it ${BMixGNB}$ motion. Basic properties such as
stochastic self-similarity and covariance matrix of the process are presented.
The bivariate distribution at fixed time of our ${BMixGNB}$ process is also

well-known hyperbolic branch (HB) and are found to possess sub-TeV neutralinos
and charginos, with mixed Bino/Higgsino LSP's with 200-800 GeV masses. In
addition, the models possess ~3-4 TeV gluino masses and heavy squarks and
sleptons with masses heavier than the gluino mass. Spectra with a Higgs mass
near 125 GeV and a relic density 0.109 < \Omega h^2 < 0.123 are found to
require EWFT at around the one-percent level, while those spectra with a much
lower relic density require EWFT of only a few percent. Moreover, the SI

directly model the peak height information and incorporates important artefacts

of one or more unknown contributors to a DNA sample. Our model is readily
extended to simultaneous analysis of more than one mixture as illustrated in a

partition of V into k parts such that only the identity permutation in G fixes
setwise all of the cells of the partition. The least cardinal number k such
that (G,V) is k-distinguishable is its distinguishing number. In particular, a
graph X is k-distinguishable if its automorphism group Aut(X) has
distinguishing number at most k in its action on the vertices of X.
  Various results in the literature demonstrate that when an infinite graph
fails to have some property, then often some finite subgraph is similarly
deficient. In this paper we show that whenever an infinite connected graph X is
not k-distinguishable (for a given cardinal k), then it contains a ball B of
finite radius whose distinguishing number is at least k. Moreover, this lower
bound cannot be sharpened, since for any integer k greater than 3 there exists
an infinite, locally finite, connected graph X that is not k-distinguishable
but in which every ball of finite radius is k-distinguishable.
  In the second half of this paper we show that a large distinguishing number
for an imprimitive graph X is traceable to a high distinguishing number either
of a block of imprimitivity or of the induced action of Aut(X) on the
corresponding system of imprimitivity. The distinguishing numbers of infinite
primitive graphs have been examined in detail in a previous paper by the
authors together with Tom W. Tucker.

Service Level Agreement (SLA) between the Cloud provider and the client that
can be expressed as follows: the client comes with a minimal number of service
instances which must be alive at the end of the day, and the Cloud provider
offers a list of pairs (price,compensation), this compensation being paid by
the Cloud provider if it fails to keep alive the required number of services.
On the Cloud provider side, each pair corresponds actually to a guaranteed
success probability of fulfilling the constraint on the minimal number of

probability of success, the question for the Cloud provider is to find the
number of necessary resources, their clock frequency and an allocation of the
instances (possibly using replication) onto machines. This solution should
satisfy all types of constraints during a given time period while minimizing
the energy consumption of used resources. We consider two energy consumption
models based on DVFS techniques, where the clock frequency of physical
resources can be changed. For each allocation problem and each energy model, we
prove deterministic approximation ratios on the consumed energy for algorithms

heuristic, whose energy ratio is not guaranteed.

DNA is of crucial importance for understanding and predicting regulatory
elements in gene networks. TFBS motifs are commonly described by Position
Weight Matrices (PWMs), in which each DNA base pair independently contributes
to the transcription factor (TF) binding, despite mounting evidence of
interdependence between base pairs positions. The recent availability of
genome-wide data on TF-bound DNA regions offers the possibility to revisit this
question in detail for TF binding {\em in vivo}. Here, we use available fly and
mouse ChIPseq data, and show that the independent model generally does not
reproduce the observed statistics of TFBS, generalizing previous observations.
We further show that TFBS description and predictability can be systematically
improved by taking into account pairwise correlations in the TFBS via the
principle of maximum entropy. The resulting pairwise interaction model is
formally equivalent to the disordered Potts models of statistical mechanics and
it generalizes previous approaches to interdependent positions. Its structure
allows for co-variation of two or more base pairs, as well as secondary motifs.
Although models consisting of mixtures of PWMs also have this last feature, we
show that pairwise interaction models outperform them. The significant pairwise
interactions are found to be sparse and found dominantly between consecutive
base pairs. Finally, the use of a pairwise interaction model for the
identification of TFBSs is shown to give significantly different predictions
than a model based on independent positions.

in this decay. The measurement has been carried out with the KLOE detector
operating at the phi-factory DAFNE in the Italian National Center for Nuclear
Physics in Frascati. The KS mesons were identified with high efficiency via
registration of these KL mesons which crossed the drift chamber without
decaying and then interacted with the KLOE electromagnetic calorimeter. The KS
four-momentum vector was then determined using the registered position of the
KL meson and the known momentum of the phi meson. Next, the search for the KS

gamma quanta which momenta were reconstructed using time and energy measured by
the electromagnetic calorimeter. To increase the signal over background ratio
after identification of the KS meson and requiring six reconstructed photons a
discriminant analysis is performed. It is based on kinematical fit, testing of
the signal and background hypotheses and exploiting of the differences in
kinematics of the KS decays into 2pi0 and 3pi0. Hence, we have obtained the
upper limit on the KS -> 3pi0 branching ratio at the 90% confidence level BR(KS

of constituent galaxies and partly to large rotational velocities in two
counter-rotating gas disks -- a scenario predicted to lead to the most intense
starbursts, which will therefore come in pairs. The disks have M(dyn) of

modest so the disks are unstable, potentially on scales commensurate with their
radii: these galaxies are undergoing extreme bursts of star formation, not
confined to their nuclei, at close to the Eddington limit. Their specific
star-formation rates place them ~>5x above the main sequence, which supposedly
comprises large gas disks like these. Their high star-formation efficiencies

tidal flares can also be produced by SMBHs in merging galaxies. In this paper,
we computed the tidal flare rates by dual SMBHs in two merging galaxies before
the SMBHs become self-gravitationally bounded. We employ an analytical model to
calculate the tidal loss-cone feeding rates for both SMBHs, taking into account
two-body relaxation of stars, tidal perturbations by the companion galaxy, and
chaotic stellar orbits in triaxial gravitational potential. We show that for
typical SMBHs with mass 10^7 M_\sun, the loss-cone feeding rates are enhanced
by mergers up to \Gamma ~ 10^{-2} yr^{-1}, about two order of magnitude higher
than those by single SMBHs in isolated galaxies and about four orders of
magnitude higher than those by recoiling SMBHs. The enhancements are mainly due
to tidal perturbations by the companion galaxy. We suggest that off-center
tidal flares are overwhelmed by those from merging galaxies, making the
identification of recoiling SMBHs challenging. Based on the calculated rates,
we estimate the relative contributions of tidal flare events by single, binary,
and dual SMBH systems during cosmic time. Our calculations show that the
off-center tidal disruption flares by un-bound SMBHs in merging galaxies
contribute a fraction comparable to that by single SMBHs in isolated galaxies.
We conclude that off-center tidal disruptions are powerful tracers of the

driving winds in a wide variety of astrophysical systems. However, the
efficiency of the coupling between the radiation field and the dusty gas is
poorly understood in environments characterized by high optical depths. We
present a series of idealized numerical experiments, performed with the
radiation-hydrodynamic code ORION, in which we study the dynamics of such winds
and quantify their properties. We find that, after wind acceleration begins,
radiation Rayleigh-Taylor instability forces the gas into a configuration that
reduces the rate of momentum transfer from the radiation field to the gas by a
factor ~ 10 - 100 compared to an estimate based on the optical depth at the
base of the atmosphere; instead, the rate of momentum transfer from a driving
radiation field of luminosity L to the gas is roughly L/c multiplied by one
plus half the optical depth evaluated using the photospheric temperature, which
is far smaller than the optical depth one would obtain using the interior
temperature. When we apply our results to conditions appropriate to ULIRGs and
star clusters, we find that the asymptotic wind momentum flux from such objects
should not significantly exceed that carried by the direct radiation field,
L/c. This result constrains the expected mass loss rates from systems that
exceed the Eddington limit to be of order the so-called ""single-scattering""
limit, and not significantly higher. We present an approximate fitting formula
for the rate of momentum transfer from radiation to dusty gas through which it

fraction of CEMP stars without invoking non-standard nucleosynthesis or a
substantial change in the initial mass function. This is interpreted as
evidence of missing physical ingredients in the models. Recent hydrodynamical
simulations show that efficient wind mass transfer is possible in the case of
the slow and dense winds typical of AGB stars through a mechanism called wind
Roche-lobe overflow (WRLOF), which lies in between the canonical
Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion and Roche-lobe overflow. WRLOF has an
effect on the accretion efficiency of mass transfer and on the angular momentum
lost by the binary system. The aim of this work is to understand the overall
effect of WRLOF on the population of CEMP stars. To simulate populations of
low-metallicity binaries we combined a synthetic nucleosynthesis model with a
binary population synthesis code. In this code we implemented the WRLOF
mechanism. We used the results of hydrodynamical simulations to model the
effect of WRLOF on the accretion efficiency and we took the effect on the
angular momentum loss into account by assuming a simple prescription. As a
result the number of CEMP stars predicted by our model increases by a factor
1.2-1.8 compared to earlier results that consider the BHL prescription.
Moreover, higher enrichments of carbon are produced and the final orbital
period distribution is shifted towards shorter periods.

at aligning the spins of few-solar mass black-hole progenitors with the orbital
angular momentum, we find that black-hole spins should be expected to
preferentially lie in a plane when they become detectable by gravitational-wave
interferometers. This ""resonant plane"" is identified by the conditions
\Delta\Phi=0{\deg} or \Delta\Phi=+/-180{\deg}, where \Delta\Phi is the angle
between the components of the black-hole spins in the plane orthogonal to the
orbital angular momentum. If the angles \Delta \Phi can be accurately measured
for a large sample of gravitational-wave detections, their distribution will
constrain models of compact binary formation. In particular, it will tell us
whether tidal interactions are efficient and whether a mechanism such as mass
transfer, stellar winds, or supernovae can induce a mass-ratio reversal (so
that the heavier black hole is produced by the initially lighter stellar
progenitor). Therefore our model offers a concrete observational link between
gravitational-wave measurements and astrophysics. We also hope that it will
stimulate further studies of precessional dynamics, gravitational-wave template
placement and parameter estimation for binaries locked in the resonant plane.

Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. In both cases the host stars are well-aligned with
the orbital planes of the planets. For KOI-94 we find \lambda=-11+-11 deg,
confirming a recent result by Hirano and coworkers. Kepler-25 was a more
challenging case because the transit depth is unusually small (0.13 %). To
obtain the obliquity it was necessary to use prior knowledge of the star's
projected rotation rate, and apply two different analysis methods to
independent wavelength regions of the spectra. The two methods gave consistent
results, \lambda=7+-8 deg and -0.5+-5.7 deg.
  There are now a total of five obliquity measurements for host stars of
systems of multiple transiting planets, all of which are consistent with
spin-orbit alignment. This alignment is unlikely to be the result of tidal
interactions, because of the relatively large orbital distances and low
planetary masses in the systems. In this respect the multiplanet host stars
differ from hot-Jupiter host stars, which commonly have large spin-orbit
misalignments whenever tidal interactions are weak. In particular the weak-tide
subset of hot-Jupiter hosts have obliquities consistent with an isotropic
distribution (p=0.6), but the multiplanet hosts are incompatible with such a
distribution (p~10^-6). This suggests that high obliquities are confined to
hot-Jupiter systems, and provides further evidence that hot Jupiter formation
involves processes that tilt the planetary orbit.

X-ray binaries in a super-Eddington accretion state, possibly with significant
beaming of their emission, or they might harbor a black hole of intermediate
mass (10^2 to 10^5 solar masses). Due to the enormous amount of energy
radiated, ULXs can have strong interactions with their environment,
particularly if the emission is not beamed and if they host a massive black
hole. We present early results of a project that uses archival Herschel
infrared observations of galaxies hosting bright ULXs in order to constrain the
nature of the environment surrounding the ULXs and possible interactions. We
already observe a spatial correlation between ULXs and dense clouds of cold
material, that will be quantified in subsequent work. Those observations will
allow us to test the similarities with the environment of Galactic high mass
X-ray binaries. This project will also shed light on the nature of the host
galaxies, and the possible factors that could favor the presence of a ULX in a

high-z gravitationally unstable disk galaxies. We find that the mass loss is
expected to occur through a steady wind over many tens of free-fall times (t_ff
~ 10 Myr) rather than by an explosive disruption in one or a few t_ff. Our
analysis is based on the finding from simulations that radiation trapping is
negligible because it destabilizes the wind (Krumholz & Thompson 2012, 2013).
Each photon can therefore contribute to the wind momentum only once, so the
radiative force is limited to L/c. When combining radiation, protostellar and
main-sequence winds, and supernovae, we estimate the total direct injection
rate of momentum into the outflow to be 2.5 L/c. The adiabatic phase of
supernovae and main-sequence winds can double this rate. The resulting outflow
mass-loading factor is of order unity, and if the clumps were to deplete their
gas the timescale would have been a few disk orbital times, to end with half
the original clump mass in stars. However, the clump migration time to the disk
center is on the order of an orbital time, about 250 Myr, so the clumps are
expected to complete their migration prior to depletion. Furthermore, the
clumps are expected to double their mass in a disk orbital time by accretion
from the disk and clump-clump mergers, so their mass actually grows in time and
with decreasing radius. From the 6-7 giant clumps with observed outflows, 5 are
consistent with these predictions, and one has a much higher mass-loading
factor and momentum injection rate. The latter either indicates that the
estimated outflow is an overestimate (within the 1-sigma error), that the SFR
has dropped since the time when the outflow was launched, or that the driving
mechanism is different, e.g. supernova feedback in a cavity generated by the
other feedbacks.

modest dimensions of NGC 1277. We suggest that this giant black hole was
ejected from the nearby giant galaxy NGC 1275 and subsequently captured by NGC
1277. The ejection was the result of gravitational radiation recoil when two
large black holes merged following the merger of two giant ellipticals that
helped to form NGC 1275. The black hole wandered in the cluster core until it
was captured in a close encounter with NGC 1277. The migration of black holes
in clusters may be a common occurrence.

representations theory, algebraic geometry and quantum information theory.
First - spherical actions of reductive groups on projective spaces. Second -
secant varieties of homogeneous projective varieties, and the related notions
of rank and border rank. Third - quantum entanglement. Our main result concerns
the relation between the problem of the state reconstruction from its reduced
one-particle density matrices and the minimal number of separable summands in
its decomposition. More precisely, we show that sphericity implies that states
of a given rank cannot be approximated by states of a lower rank. We call
states for which such approximation is possible exceptional states. For three,
important from quantum entanglement perspective cases of distinguishable,
fermionic and bosonic particles, we also show that non-sphericity implies the
existence of exceptional states. Remarkably, the exceptional states belong to
non-bipartite entanglement classes. In particular, we show that the $W$-type
states and their appropriate modifications are exceptional states stemming from
the second secant variety for three cases above. We point out that the
existence of the exceptional states is a physical obstruction for deciding the
local unitary equivalence of states by means of the one-particle reduced
density matrices. Finally, for a number of systems of distinguishable particles
with known orbit structure we list all exceptional states and discuss their
possible importance in entanglement theory.

is applied to a spin system, the magnetic component of a laser is shown to
induce a magnetization normal to the plane of polarization, leading to an
ultrafast phase transition. We first demonstrate this phenomenon numerically
for an $S=1$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin chain, where a new state emerges
with magnetization perpendicular to the polarization plane of the laser in
place of the topologically ordered Haldane state. We then elucidate its
physical mechanism by mapping the system to an effective static model. The
theory also indicates that the phenomenon should occur in general quantum spin
systems with a magnetic anisotropy. The required laser frequency is in the
terahertz range, with the required intensity being within a prospective
experimental feasibility.

universal Groebner basis, if G is a Groebner basis with respect to every term

the set of the maximal minors of a matrix X of variables is a universal
Groebner basis. Boocher recently proved that any initial ideal of the ideal of
maximal minors of X has a linear resolution.
  In this paper we give a quick proof of the results mentioned above. Our proof
is based on a specialization argument. Then we show that similar statements
hold in a more general setting, for matrices of linear forms satisfying certain
homogeneity conditions. More precisely, we show that the set of maximal minors
of a matrix L of linear forms is a universal Groebner basis for the ideal I
that it generates, provided that L is column-graded. Under the same assumption
we show that every initial ideal of I has a linear resolution. Furthermore, the
projective dimension of I and of its initial ideals is n-m, unless I=0 or a
column of L is identically 0. Here L is a matrix of size m times n, and m is
smaller than or equal to n. If instead L is row-graded, then we prove that I
has a universal Groebner basis of elements of degree m and that every initial
ideal of I has a linear resolution, provided that I has the expected
codimension.
  The proofs are based on a rigidity property of radical Borel fixed ideals in
a multigraded setting: We prove that if two Borel fixed ideals I and J have the
same multigraded Hilbert series and I is radical, then I = J. We also discuss
some of the consequences of this rigidity property.

classification takes into account only topological or physical features of the

that the internal structures formed by the words do present patterns that,
generally, cannot be correctly unveiled by only traditional techniques.

in 180 luminous and 22 ultraluminous IR galaxies represents a complete subset
of the IRAS RBGS and covers a range of merger stages, morphologies and spectral
types. The majority (>60%) of GOALS LIRGs have high 6.2um PAH equivalent widths
(EQW > 0.4um) and low levels of silicate absorption (s_9.7um >-1.0). There is a
general trend among the U/LIRGs for silicate depth and MIR slope to increase
with LIR. U/LIRGs in the late stages of a merger also have on average steeper
MIR slopes and higher levels of dust obscuration. Together these trends suggest
that as gas & dust is funneled towards the center of a coalescing merger, the
nuclei become more compact and obscured. The sources that depart from these
correlations have very low PAH EQW (EQW < 0.1um) consistent with their MIR
emission being dominated by an AGN. The most heavily dust obscured sources are
the most compact in their MIR emission, suggesting that the obscuring (cool)
dust is associated with the outer regions of the starburst. As the merger
progresses a marked decline is seen for the fraction of high EQW (star
formation dominated) sources while the fraction of composite sources increases
but the fraction of AGN-dominated sources remains low. When compared to the MIR
spectra of submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) at z~2, the average GOALS LIRG is more
absorbed at 9.7um and has more PAH emission. However, when the AGN
contributions to both the local LIRGs and the high-z SMGs are removed, the
average local starbursting LIRG closely resembles the starbursting SMGs.

the thermal mean-field, the low-energy enhancement of the strength functions in
highly-excited compound nuclei is explained by nucleonic transitions from the
thermally unblocked single-quasiparticle states to the single-(quasi)particle
continuum. This result is obtained within the finite-temperature quasiparticle
random phase approximation in the coordinate space with exact treatment of the
single-particle continuum and exactly eliminated spurious translational mode.
The case of radiative dipole strength functions at the nuclear excitation
energies typical for the thermal neutron capture is illustrated for 94-Mo and
144-Nd in comparison to available data.

measurably different peak luminosities. We attribute the difference in the UV
continua to significantly different progenitor metallicities. This is the first
robust detection of different metallicities for SN Ia progenitors. Theoretical
reasoning suggests that differences in metallicity also lead to differences in
luminosity. SNe Ia with higher progenitor metallicities have lower 56Ni yields,
and lower luminosities, for the same light-curve shape. SNe 2011by and 2011fe
have different peak luminosities (Delta M_V = 0.6 mag), which correspond to
different 56Ni yields: M_11fe(56Ni)/M_11by(56Ni) = 1.7^+0.7_-0.5. From
theoretical models that account for different neutron to proton ratios in
progenitors, the differences in 56Ni yields for SNe 2011by and 2011fe imply
that their progenitor stars were above and below solar metallicity,

10^{19}$ eV due to the limit on the spin rate of neutron stars. We have
previously shown that the escape through the young supernova remnant softens
the spectrum, decreases slightly the maximum energy, and generates secondary

effect of propagation in the interstellar and intergalactic media modifies the
combined spectrum of all pulsars. By assuming a normal distribution of pulsar
birth periods centered at 300 ms, we show that the contribution of
extragalactic pulsar births to the ultrahigh energy cosmic ray spectrum
naturally gives rise to a contribution to very high energy cosmic rays (VHECRs,
between $10^{16}$ and $10^{18}$ eV) by Galactic pulsar births. The required
injected composition to fit the observed spectrum depends on the absolute
energy scale, which is uncertain, differing between Auger Observatory and
Telescope Array. The contribution of Galactic pulsar births can also bridge the
gap between predictions for cosmic ray acceleration in supernova remnants and
the observed spectrum just below the ankle, depending on the composition of the
cosmic rays that escape the supernova remnant and the diffusion behavior of
VHECRs in the Galaxy.

expected, distinction was easier for the strongly simplified versions, where

monolingual terminology extraction and bilingual term alignment based on
multi-level termhood.
  Design/methodology/approach: A method based on multi-level termhood is
proposed. The new method computes the termhood of the terminology candidate as
well as the sentence that includes the terminology by the comparison of the
corpus. Since terminologies and general words usually have differently
distribution in the corpus, termhood can also be used to constrain and enhance
the performance of term alignment when aligning bilingual terms on the parallel
corpus. In this paper, bilingual term alignment based on termhood constraints
is presented.
  Findings: Experiment results show multi-level termhood can get better
performance than existing method for terminology extraction. If termhood is

Questions remain about the formation locations of the giant planets, and the
degree to which volatile material was mixed throughout the proto-planetary
system. One diagnostic which offers great promise in helping to unravel the
history of planet formation is the study of the level of deuteration in various
Solar system bodies. For example, the D/H ratio of methane in the atmosphere of
Titan can be used as a diagnostic of the initial conditions of the solar nebula
within the region of giant planet formation, and can help us to determine where
Titan (and, by extension, the Saturnian system) accreted its volatile material.
The level of Titanian deuteration also has implications for both the sources

results of observations taken in the 1.58 microns window using the NIFS

The suitability of using deeper hierarchies and network topology was confirmed

streamwise length scales may be significantly amplified even in the absence of
inertia. For fluctuations without streamwise variations, we derive explicit
analytical expressions for the dependence of the worst-case amplification (from
different forcing to different velocity and polymer stress components) on the
Weissenberg number ($We$), the maximum extensibility of the polymer chains
($L$), the viscosity ratio, and the spanwise wavenumber. For the Oldroyd-B
model, the amplification of the most energetic components of velocity and
polymer stress fields scales as $We^2$ and $We^4$. On the other hand, finite
extensibility of polymer molecules limits the largest achievable amplification
even in flows with infinitely large Weissenberg numbers: in the presence of
wall-normal and spanwise forces the amplification of the streamwise velocity
and polymer stress fluctuations is bounded by quadratic and quartic functions
of $L$. This high amplification signals low robustness to modeling
imperfections of inertialess channel flows of viscoelastic fluids. The
underlying physical mechanism involves interactions of polymer stress
fluctuations with a base shear, and it represents a close analog of the lift-up
mechanism that initiates a bypass transition in inertial flows of Newtonian

for private cloud. The challenge is trade-off between minimizing of energy
consumption and satisfying Quality of Service (QoS) (e.g. performance or
resource availability on time for reservation request). We consider resource
needs in context of a private cloud system to provide resources for
applications in teaching and researching. In which users request computing
resources for laboratory classes at start times and non-interrupted duration in
some hours in prior. Many previous works are based on migrating techniques to
move online virtual machines (VMs) from low utilization hosts and turn these
hosts off to reduce energy consumption. However, the techniques for migration
of VMs could not use in our case. In this paper, a genetic algorithm for
power-aware in scheduling of resource allocation (GAPA) has been proposed to
solve the static virtual machine allocation problem (SVMAP). Due to limited
resources (i.e. memory) for executing simulation, we created a workload that
contains a sample of one-day timetable of lab hours in our university. We
evaluate the GAPA and a baseline scheduling algorithm (BFD), which sorts list
of virtual machines in start time (i.e. earliest start time first) and using
best-fit decreasing (i.e. least increased power consumption) algorithm, for
solving the same SVMAP. As a result, the GAPA algorithm obtains total energy
consumption is lower than the baseline algorithm on simulated experimentation.

dynamical matrix. Entropies of the rescaled dynamical matrix known as map
entropies describe a degree of introduced decoherence. Within the so-called
natural representation, the quantum channel is formally posed by another matrix
obtained as reshuffling of the dynamical matrix. The corresponding entropies
characterize an amount, with which the receiver a priori knows the channel
output. As was previously shown, the map and receiver entropies are mutually
complementary characteristics. Indeed, there exists a non-trivial lower bound
on their sum. First, we extend the concept of receiver entropy to the family of

non-trivial lower bounds on the sum of the map and receiver $(q,s)$-entropies.

constant non-equilibrium constraints enforced by reservoirs exchanging
conserved microscopic quantities. In models with a finite number of possible
configurations, if the microscopic dynamics is assumed to be deterministic and
ergodic and to conserve energy according to some specific pattern, and if the
mesoscopic evolution of the global system is approximated by a Markov process
as closely as possible, then the mesoscopic transition rates obey three
constraints. In the limit where macroscopic bodies can be considered as
reservoirs at thermodynamic equilibrium (but with different intensive
parameters) the third constraint becomes modified detailed balance (MDB) ; the
latter is generically expressed in terms of the microscopic exchange entropy
variation. We investigate the generic statistical properties for measurable
quantities that arise from the MDB constraint. For a finite-time evolution
after the system prepared in an equilibrium state has been set in contact with
thermostats at different temperatures, we derive a detailed fluctuation
relation for the excess exchange entropy variation. In the non-equilibrium
stationary state (long-time limit), the proper mathematical definition of a
large deviation function is introduced together with alternative definitions,
and fluctuation relations are rederived. The generalization to systems
exchanging energy, volume and matter with several reservoirs, with a possible
conservative external force acting on the contact system, is given explicitly.
The infinite time limit of any odd cumulant per unit time of exchanged
quantities is expressed in terms of a series involving higher even cumulants

a new dimension of modularity. Existing techniques use the program to
incrementally construct a termination proof. While the proof keeps changing,
the program remains the same. Our technique goes a step further. We show how to
use the current partial proof to partition the transition relation into those
behaviors known to be terminating from the current proof, and those whose
status (terminating or not) is not known yet. This partition enables a new and
unexplored dimension of incremental reasoning on the program side. In addition,
we show that our approach naturally applies to conditional termination which
searches for a precondition ensuring termination. We further report on a
prototype implementation that advances the state-of-the-art on the grounds of
termination and conditional termination.

applications in many areas of computer science, including distributed
computing. In this paper, we focus on the problem of sampling random walks
efficiently in a distributed network and its applications. Given bandwidth
constraints, the goal is to minimize the number of rounds required to obtain
random walk samples.
  All previous algorithms that compute a random walk sample of length $\ell$ as
a subroutine always do so naively, i.e., in $O(\ell)$ rounds. The main
contribution of this paper is a fast distributed algorithm for performing
random walks. We present a sublinear time distributed algorithm for performing
random walks whose time complexity is sublinear in the length of the walk. Our
algorithm performs a random walk of length $\ell$ in $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\ell D})$
rounds ($\tilde{O}$ hides $\polylog{n}$ factors where $n$ is the number of
nodes in the network) with high probability on an undirected network, where $D$
is the diameter of the network. For small diameter graphs, this is a
significant improvement over the naive $O(\ell)$ bound. Furthermore, our
algorithm is optimal within a poly-logarithmic factor as there exists a
matching lower bound [Nanongkai et al. PODC 2011]. We further extend our
algorithms to efficiently perform $k$ independent random walks in
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{k\ell D} + k)$ rounds. We also show that our algorithm can be
applied to speedup the more general Metropolis-Hastings sampling.
  Our random walk algorithms can be used to speed up distributed algorithms in
applications that use random walks as a subroutine, such as computing a random
spanning tree and estimating mixing time and related parameters. Our algorithm
is fully decentralized and can serve as a building block in the design of
topologically-aware networks.

a graph $G$, the goal of the first type of random-walk domination problem is to
target $k$ nodes such that the total hitting time of an $L$-length random walk
starting from the remaining nodes to the targeted nodes is minimal. The second
type of random-walk domination problem is to find $k$ nodes to maximize the
expected number of nodes that hit any one targeted node through an $L$-length
random walk. We prove that these problems are two special instances of the
submodular set function maximization with cardinality constraint problem. To
solve them effectively, we propose a dynamic-programming (DP) based greedy
algorithm which is with near-optimal performance guarantee. The DP-based greedy
algorithm, however, is not very efficient due to the expensive marginal gain
evaluation. To further speed up the algorithm, we propose an approximate greedy
algorithm with linear time complexity w.r.t.\ the graph size and also with
near-optimal performance guarantee. The approximate greedy algorithm is based
on a carefully designed random-walk sampling and sample-materialization

presence of {\em small clusters}. Traditional results dictate that for an
algorithm to provably correctly recover the clusters, {\em all} clusters must
be sufficiently large (in particular, $\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{n})$ where $n$ is
the number of nodes of the graph). We show that this is not really a
restriction: by a more refined analysis of the trace-norm based recovery
approach proposed in Jalali et al. (2011) and Chen et al. (2012), we prove that
small clusters, under certain mild assumptions, do not hinder recovery of large
ones.
  Based on this result, we further devise an iterative algorithm to recover
{\em almost all clusters} via a ""peeling strategy"", i.e., recover large
clusters first, leading to a reduced problem, and repeat this procedure. These
results are extended to the {\em partial observation} setting, in which only a
(chosen) part of the graph is observed.The peeling strategy gives rise to an
active learning algorithm, in which edges adjacent to smaller clusters are
queried more often as large clusters are learned (and removed).
  From a high level, this paper sheds novel insights on high-dimensional
statistics and learning structured data, by presenting a structured matrix
learning problem for which a one shot convex relaxation approach necessarily
fails, but a carefully constructed sequence of convex relaxationsdoes the job.

it shown that when the well known properties of the under-cooled liquid regime,

the vicinity of the preliminary estimator and make further observations at some
design points in that vicinity. We fit an appropriate polynomial regression
model to estimate the location and size of the maximum. We establish that,
under suitable smoothness conditions and appropriate choice of the zooming, the
second stage estimators have better convergence rates than the corresponding
first stage estimators of $\bolds{\mu}$ and M. More specifically, for
$\alpha$-smooth regression functions, the optimal nonparametric rates
$n^{-(\alpha-1)/(2\alpha+d)}$ and $n^{-\alpha/(2\alpha+d)}$ at the first stage
can be improved to $n^{-(\alpha-1)/(2\alpha)}$ and $n^{-1/2}$, respectively,
for $\alpha>1+\sqrt{1+d/2}$. These rates are optimal in the class of all
possible sequential estimators. Interestingly, the two-stage procedure resolves
""the curse of the dimensionality"" problem to some extent, as the dimension d
does not control the second stage convergence rates, provided that the function
class is sufficiently smooth. We consider a multi-stage generalization of our
procedure that attains the optimal rate for any smoothness level $\alpha>2$
starting with a preliminary estimator with any power-law rate at the first

implemented a 1-D Energy Balance Model (EBM), the simplest seasonal model of
planetary climate, with new prescriptions for most physical quantities. Here we
apply our EBM to investigate the surface habitability of planets with an
Earth-like atmospheric composition but different levels of surface pressure.
The habitability, defined as the mean fraction of the planet's surface on which
liquid water could exist, is estimated from the pressure-dependent liquid water
temperature range, taking into account seasonal and latitudinal variations of
surface temperature. By running several thousands of EBM simulations we
generated a map of the habitable zone (HZ) in the plane of the orbital
semi-major axis, a, and surface pressure, p, for planets in circular orbits
around a Sun-like star. As pressure increases, the HZ becomes broader, with an
increase of 0.25 AU in its radial extent from p=1/3 bar to p=3 bar. At low
pressure, the habitability is low and varies with a; at high pressure, the
habitability is high and relatively constant inside the HZ. We interpret these
results in terms of the pressure dependence of the greenhouse effect, the
effciency of horizontal heat transport, and the extent of the liquid water
temperature range. Within the limits discussed in the paper, the results can be
extended to planets in eccentric orbits around non-solar type stars. The main
characteristics of the pressure-dependent HZ are modestly affected by
variations of planetary properties, particularly at high pressure.

invasion of the domain wall from the soft to the hard phase, domain wall
annihilation and the presence of the reversible magnetization with the applied

a single switching behaviour corresponding to the coherent reversal of the both
soft and hard phases. However, the composite having higher Cobalt Ferrite
particle size shows two peak behaviour in the FORC distribution resembling
individual switching of the soft and hard phases. The FORC distribution in (Hu,

influenced by their interaction with the magnetic field and corona of the host
star, the physics of this process can be effectively constrained by making
sensitive measurements of the planetary radio emission. Up to now, however,
numerous searches for radio emission from extrasolar planets at radio
wavelengths have only yielded negative results. Here we report deep radio
observations of the nearby Neptune-mass extrasolar transiting planet HAT-P-11b
at 150 MHz, using the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT). On July 16, 2009,
we detected a 3-sigma emission whose light curve is consistent with an eclipse
when the planet passed behind the star. This emission is at a position 14
arcsec from the transiting exoplanet's coordinates; thus, with a synthetized
beam of FWHM~16 arcsec, the position uncertainty of this weak radio signal
encompasses the location of HAT-P-11. We estimate a 5% false positive
probability that the observed radio light curve mimics the planet's eclipse
light curve. If the faint signature is indeed a radio eclipse event associated
with the planet, then its flux would be 3.87 mJy +/- 1.29 mJy at 150 MHz.
However, our equally sensitive repeat observations of the system on November
17, 2010 did not detect a significant signal in the radio light curve near the
same position. This lack of confirmation leaves us with the possibility of
either a variable planetary emission, or a chance occurrence of a false
positive signal in our first observation. Deeper observations are required to
confirm this hint of 150 MHz radio emission from HAT-P-11b.

$[0,1]$ and $[0,1]^2$ based on the decoration of nodes and edges. A graph
sequence is defined to be converging if the corresponding sequence of random
measures satisfies the Large Deviations Principle with respect to the topology
of weak convergence on bounded measures on $[0,1]^d, d=1,2$. We then establish
that LD-convergence implies several previous notions of convergence, namely
so-called right-convergence, left-convergence, and partition-convergence. The
corresponding large deviation rate function can be interpreted as the limit
object of the sparse graph sequence. In particular, we can express the limiting
free energies in terms of this limit object.

Nelson","Saving phase: Injectivity and stability for phase retrieval","22 pages",,,,"math.FA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","  Recent advances in convex optimization have led to new strides in the phase
retrieval problem over finite-dimensional vector spaces. However, certain
fundamental questions remain: What sorts of measurement vectors uniquely
determine every signal up to a global phase factor, and how many are needed to
do so? Furthermore, which measurement ensembles lend stability? This paper
presents several results that address each of these questions. We begin by
characterizing injectivity, and we identify that the complement property is
indeed a necessary condition in the complex case. We then pose a conjecture
that 4M-4 generic measurement vectors are both necessary and sufficient for
injectivity in M dimensions, and we prove this conjecture in the special cases
where M=2,3. Next, we shift our attention to stability, both in the worst and
average cases. Here, we characterize worst-case stability in the real case by
introducing a numerical version of the complement property. This new property
bears some resemblance to the restricted isometry property of compressed
sensing and can be used to derive a sharp lower Lipschitz bound on the
intensity measurement mapping. Localized frames are shown to lack this property
(suggesting instability), whereas Gaussian random measurements are shown to
satisfy this property with high probability. We conclude by presenting results
that use a stochastic noise model in both the real and complex cases, and we
leverage Cramer-Rao lower bounds to identify stability with stronger versions
of the injectivity characterizations.

parameter lambda is to be regarded as a measure of the non-commutativity -
setting lambda = 0 means a return to the standard quantum mechanics. As the
very first step a rotationaly invariant non-commutative 3D space, an analog of
the Coulomb problem configuration space (3D space with origin extracted), is
introduced. The non-commutative space in question is generated by NC
coordinates realized as operators acting in an auxiliary Fock space. The
properly weighted Hilbert-Schmidt operators in this Fock space form an NC
analog of the Hilbert space of the wave functions. We will refer to them as

hamiltonian as a hermitian operator is one of the key parts of this paper. The
resulting problem is exactly solvable. The full solution is provided, including

evaluate the vesicularity and noble gas fractionation, and to shed light on
bubble formation during MORB degassing. A previous simulation study (Guillot
and Sator (2011) GCA 75, 1829-1857) has shown that the solubility of CO2 in
basaltic melts increases steadily with the pressure and deviates significantly
from Henry's law at high pressures (e.g. 9.5 wt% CO2 at 50 kbar as compared
with 2.5 wt% from Henry's law). From the CO2 solubility curve and the equations
of state of the two coexisting phases (silicate melt and supercritical CO2),
deduced from the MD simulation, we have evaluated the evolution of the
vesicularity of a MORB melt at depth as function of its initial CO2 contents.
An excellent agreement is obtained between calculations and data on MORB
samples collected at oceanic ridges. Moreover, by implementing the test
particle method (Guillot and Sator (2012) GCA 80, 51-69), the solubility of
noble gases in the two coexisting phases (supercritical CO2 and CO2-saturated
melt), the partitioning and the fractionation of noble gases between melt and
vesicles have been evaluated as function of the pressure. We show that the
melt/CO2 partition coefficients of noble gases increase significantly with the
pressure whereas the large distribution of the 4He/40Ar* ratio reported in the
literature is explained if the magma experiences a suite of vesiculation and
vesicle loss during ascent. By applying a pressure drop to a volatile bearing
melt, the MD simulation reveals the main steps of bubble formation and noble
gas transfer at the nanometric scale. A key result is that the transfer of
noble gases is found to be driven by CO2 bubble nucleation, a finding which
suggests that the diffusivity difference between He and Ar in the degassing
melt has virtually no effect on the 4He/40Ar* ratio measured in the vesicles.

emission could be dominated by ions producing neutral pion-decay emission or
electrons producing inverse-Compton gamma-rays. Unambiguously identifying the

origin of CRs, it will add significantly to our understanding of the diffusive
shock acceleration (DSA) mechanism and improve our understanding of supernovae
and the impact SNRs have on the circumstellar medium. In this study, we
investigate the Vela Jr. SNR, an example of TeV-bright non-thermal SNRs. We
perform hydrodynamic simulations coupled with non-linear DSA and
non-equilibrium ionization near the forward shock (FS) to confront currently
available multi-wavelength data. We find, with an analysis similar to that used
earlier for SNR RX J1713.7-3946, that self-consistently modeling the thermal
X-ray line emission with the non-thermal continuum in our one-dimensional model
strongly constrains the fitting parameters, and this leads convincingly to a
leptonic origin for the GeV-TeV emission for Vela Jr. This conclusion is
further supported by applying additional constraints from observation,
including the radial brightness profiles of the SNR shell in TeV gamma-rays,
and the spatial variation of the X-ray synchrotron spectral index. We will

called e-dipole pulses. We address the conditions required, such as the quality
of the vacuum, for reaching high intensities without initiating beam-depleting
cascades, the number of pairs which can be created, and experimental detection
of the created pairs. We find that e-dipole pulses offer an optimal method of
investigating nonperturbative QED.

resource in quantum information theory. A fundamental need is then the
understanding its qualification and its quantification: Is the quantum state
entangled, and if it is, then how much entanglement is carried by that? These
questions introduce the topics of separability criteria and entanglement
measures, both of which are based on the issue of classification of
multipartite entanglement. In this dissertation, after reviewing these three
fundamental topics for finite dimensional Hilbert spaces, I present my
contribution to knowledge. My main result is the elaboration of the partial
separability classification of mixed states of quantum systems composed of
arbitrary number of subsystems of Hilbert spaces of arbitrary dimensions. This
problem is simple for pure states, however, for mixed states it has not been
considered in full detail yet. I give not only the classification but also
necessary and sufficient criteria for the classes, which make it possible to
determine to which class a mixed state belongs. Moreover, these criteria are
given by the vanishing of quantities measuring entanglement. Apart from these,
I present some side results related to the entanglement of mixed states. These
results are obtained in the learning phase of my studies and give some
illustrations and examples.

the verification of hardware and software, e.g., in bounded-model check- ing,
CEGAR, SMT, etc., whose hardest part is how to synthesize interpolants. Various
work for discovering interpolants for propositional logic, quantifier-free
fragments of first-order theories and their combinations have been proposed.
However, little work focuses on discovering polynomial interpolants in the
literature. In this paper, we provide an approach for constructing non-linear
interpolants based on semidefinite programming, and show how to apply such
results to the verification of programs by examples.

across two different Schottky interfaces viz. a polycrystalline Si(111)/Au and
an epitaxial Si(111)/NiSi_2 interface using ballistic electron emission
microscopy (BEEM). For similarly prepared Si(111) substrates and identical Ni
thickness, the BEEM transmission is found to be lower for the polycrystalline
interface than for the epitaxial interface. However, in both cases, the
hot-electron attenuation length in Ni is found to be the same. This is
elucidated by the temperature-independent inelastic scattering, transmission
probabilities across the Schottky interface, and scattering at dissimilar
interfaces.

of noncommutative field theory. The Einstein-Maxwell field equations are solved
with charged anisotropic fluid. We choose the forms of mass and charge
densities which belong to two parameter family of density distribution
functions instead of densities as Gaussian width length. It is found that the
corresponding densities and the Ricci scalar are singular at origin whereas the
metric is nonsingular indicating a spacelike singularity. The numerical
solution of the horizon equation implies that there are either two or one or no
horizon depending on the mass. We also evaluate the Hawking temperature which
implies that a black hole with two horizons is evaporated to an extremal black
hole with one horizon.

solutions in five dimensions in the Einstein--Born-Infeld theory. We start with
an extremal five-dimensional Myers-Perry black hole seed in which the two
possible angular momenta have equal magnitude, and add Born-Infeld electrical
charge keeping the extremality condition as a constraint. The perturbative
parameter is assumed to be the electric charge $q$ and the perturbations are
performed up to 4th order. We also study some physical properties of these
black holes. It is shown that the perturbative parameter $q$ and the
Born-Infeld parameter $\beta$ modify the values of the physical quantities of
the black holes. The solution suggests that the magnetic moment and
gyromagnetic ratio of the black hole spacetime change sign when the Born-Infeld
character of the solution starts to depart strongly from the Maxwell limit. We
venture an interpretation for the effect.

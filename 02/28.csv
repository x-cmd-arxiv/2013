While
conventional equilibrium statistical mechanics is not useful for characterizing
granular materials, the idea of constructing a statistical ensemble analogous
to its equilibrium counterpart to describe static granular matter was proposed
by Edwards and Oakshott more than two decades ago. Recent years have seen
several implementations of this idea. One of these is the stress ensemble,
which is based on properties of the force moment tensor, and applies to
frictional and frictionless grains. We demonstrate the full utility of this
statistical framework in shear jammed (SJ) experimental states [1,2], a special
class of granular solids created by pure shear, which is a strictly
non-equilbrium protocol for creating solids. We demonstrate that the stress
ensemble provides an excellent quantitative description of fluctuations in
experimental SJ states. We show that the stress fluctuations are controlled by
a single tensorial quantity: the angoricity of the system, which is a direct
analog of the thermodynamic temperature. SJ states exhibit significant
correlations in local stresses and are thus inherently different from
density-driven, isotropically jammed (IJ) states.

extreme cosmic event ca. AD775. Using a simple model, M12 claimed that the

This implied a new paradigm of either an impossibly strong solar flare or a
very strong cosmic ray event of unknown origin occurred ca. AD775. We show that
the strength of the event was significantly overestimated by M12. Several
subsequent works have attempted to find a possible exotic source for such an

event with analysis of new datasets and consistent theoretical modelling. We
verified the experimental result for the AD775 event using independent datasets
including 10Be series and newly measured 14C annual data. We surveyed available
historical chronicles for astronomical observations for the AD770s to identify
potential sightings of aurorae or supernovae. We interpreted the 14C
measurements using an appropriate carbon cycle model. We show that: (1) The
reality of the AD775 event is confirmed by new measurements of 14C; (2) by
using an inappropriate carbon cycle model, M12 strongly overestimated the
event's strength; (3) The revised magnitude of the event is consistent with
different independent datasets (14C, 10Be, 36Cl) and can be associated with a
strong, but not inexplicably strong, SEP event (or a sequence of events), and
provides the first evidence for an event of this magnitude (the fluence >30 MeV
was about 4.5*10^{10} /cm2) in multiple datasets; (4) This is in agreement with
increased auroral activity identified in historical chronicles. This point to
the likely solar origin of the event, which is the greatest solar event on a
multi-millennial time scale, placing a strong observational constraint on the
theory of explosive energy releases on the Sun and cool stars.

some refinements and improvements of the algorithm that allow us to calculate
the values of k(U(q)) for finite Chevalley groups of rank six and seven, except

conjecture holds for these groups. Moreover, if we write k(U(q)) as a
polynomial in q-1, then the coefficients are non-negative.

Qualitative
research in the history, philosophy, and sociology of science suggests that
this choice is shaped by an ""essential tension"" between the professional demand

this tension empirically in the context of biomedical chemistry. We use complex
networks to represent the evolving state of scientific knowledge, as expressed
in publications. We then define research strategies relative to these networks.
Scientists can introduce novel chemicals or chemical relationships--or delve
deeper into known ones. They can consolidate existing knowledge clusters, or
bridge distant ones. Analyzing such choices in aggregate, we find that the
distribution of strategies remains remarkably stable, even as chemical
knowledge grows dramatically. High-risk strategies, which explore new chemical
relationships, are less prevalent in the literature, reflecting a growing focus
on established knowledge at the expense of new opportunities. Research
following a risky strategy is more likely to be ignored but also more likely to
achieve high impact and recognition. While the outcome of a risky strategy has
a higher expected reward than the outcome of a conservative strategy, the
additional reward is insufficient to compensate for the additional risk. By
studying the winners of 137 different prizes in biomedicine and chemistry, we
show that the occasional ""gamble"" for extraordinary impact is the most
plausible explanation for observed levels of risk-taking. Our empirical
demonstration and unpacking of the ""essential tension"" suggests policy
interventions that may foster more innovative research.

that the presence of the 1/q^2-term in the SVZ-expansion due to a tachyonic
gluon mass appears naturally in the Minimum Soft Wall (MSW) and the
Gauge/String Dual (GSD) models which can also reproduce semi-quantitatively
some of the higher dimension condensate contributions appearing in the OPE. The
Hard-Wall model shows a large departure from the SVZ + 1/q^2 expansion in the
vector, scalar and gluonium channels due to the absence of any power
corrections. The equivalence of the MSW and GSD models is manifest in the
vector channel through the relation of the dilaton parameter with the tachyonic
gluon mass. For approximately reproducing the phenomenological values of the
dimension d=4,6 condensates, the holographic models require a tachyonic gluon
mass (\alpha_s/\pi)\lambda^2= -(0.12- 0.14) GeV^2, which is about twice the
fitted phenomenological value from e^+e^- data. The relation of the inverse
length parameter c_i to the tachyonic gluon mass also shows that c_i is channel
dependent but not universal for a given holographic model. Using the MSW model

field pattern created by electrical currents that are concentrated near (but
not confined within) the equatorial plane of a cylindrical coordinate system.
Our solution is not characterized by a cusp at the equatorial plane, as in
previous solutions based on a current sheet. The pattern we derive provides a
very good fit to hourglass magnetic field patterns emerging from
three-dimensional numerical simulations of core formation, and can in principle
be used for source-fitting of observed magnetic hourglass patterns.

affects the orbital motion of a test particle orbiting it with long-term
perturbations both at a classical and at a relativistic level. In this
preliminary sensitivity analysis, we show that, for the first time, the J2 c^-2
effects could be measured by the ongoing Juno mission in the gravitational
field of Jupiter during its yearlong science phase (10 November 2016-5 October
2017) thanks to its high eccentricity (e=0.947) and to the huge oblateness of
Jupiter (J2=1.47 10^-2). The semi-major axis a and the perijove \omega\ of Juno
are expected to be shifted by \Delta a =700-900 m and \Delta\omega = 50-60
milliarcseconds, respectively, over 1-2 yr. A numerical analysis shows also
that the expected J2c^-2 range-rate signal for Juno should be as large as 280
microns per second during a typical 6 h pass at its closest approach.
Independent analyses previously performed by other researchers about the
measurability of the Lense-Thirring effect showed that the radio science
apparatus of Juno should reach an accuracy in Doppler range-rate measurements
of 1-5 microns per second over such passes. The range-rate signature of the
classical even zonal perturbations is different from the 1PN one. Thus, further
investigations, based on covariance analyses of simulated Doppler data and
dedicated parameters estimation, are worth of further consideration. It turns
out that the J2 c^-2 effects cannot be responsible of the flyby anomaly in the
gravitational field of the Earth. A dedicated spacecraft in a 6678 km X 57103
km polar orbit would experience a geocentric J2 c^-2 range-rate shift of 0.4 mm

(BGs). The rms temperature fluctuations are below 100 K in the photosphere and
200-300 K in the chromosphere. The average temperature stratification in the QS
does not exhibit a clear chromospheric temperature rise, opposite to the AR
case. We find an energy content of about 7*10E18 J for BGs that repeat with a
cadence of about 160 secs. The precursors of BGs have a vertical extent of
about 200 km and a horizontal extent of about 1 Mm. The comparison of observed
with synthetic NLTE profiles confirms that the solar chromosphere in the QS
oscillates between an atmosphere in radiative equilibrium and one with a
moderate chromospheric temperature rise. Two-dimensional x-z temperature maps
exhibit nearly horizontal canopy-like structures with a few Mm extent around
photospheric magnetic field concentrations at a height of about 600 km. The
large difference between QS regions and ARs, and the better match of AR and
non-LTE reference spectra suggest that magnetic heating processes are more
important than commonly assumed. The temperature fluctuations in QS derived by
the LTE inversion do not suffice on average to maintain a stationary
chromospheric temperature rise. The spatially and vertically resolved
information on the temperature structure allows one to investigate in detail
the topology and evolution of the thermal structure in the lower solar
atmosphere.

ii) it reduces to the SU(3) Weinberg-Tomozawa Hamiltonian when light
pseudoscalar mesons are involved, thus, respecting chiral symmetry, iii)
spin-flavor in preserved in the light quark sector, and iv) heavy quark spin
symmetry is fulfilled in the heavy quark sector. In particular, baryon-meson
states with different content in c or in c-bar do not mix. The model is a
minimal one and it contains no free parameters. In this work, we focus on
baryon resonances with hidden-charm (at least one c-bar and one c quarks). We
analyze several possible sectors and, for the sector with zero net charm, we
write down the most general Lagrangian consistent with SU(3) and heavy quark
spin symmetry. We explicitly study the N and Delta states, which are produced
from the S-wave interaction of pseudoscalar and vector mesons with 1/2+ and
3/2+ baryons within the charmless and strangeless hidden charm sector. We
predict seven odd parity N-like and five Delta-like states with masses around 4
GeV, most of them as bound states. These states form heavy-quark spin
multiplets, which are almost degenerate in mass. The predicted new resonances
definitely cannot be accommodated by quark models with three constituent quarks

wall on an $L\times L$ box of $\bbZ^2$. The model describes a crystal surface
by assigning a non-negative integer height $\eta_x$ to each site $x$ in the box
and 0 heights to its boundary. The probability of a surface configuration
$\eta$ is proportional to $\exp(-\beta \mathcal{H}(\eta))$, where $\beta$ is
the inverse-temperature and $\mathcal{H}(\eta)$ sums the absolute values of
height differences between neighboring sites.
  We give a full description of the shape of the SOS surface for low enough
temperatures. First we show that with high probability the height of almost all
sites is concentrated on two levels, $H(L)=\lfloor (1/4\beta)\log L\rfloor$ and
$H(L)-1$. Moreover, for most values of $L$ the height is concentrated on the
single value $H(L)$. Next, we study the ensemble of level lines corresponding
to the heights $(H(L),H(L)-1,...)$. We prove that w.h.p. there is a unique
macroscopic level line for each height. Furthermore, when taking a diverging
sequence of system sizes $L_k$, the rescaled macroscopic level line at height
$H(L_k)-n$ has a limiting shape if the fractional parts of $(1/4\beta)\log L_k$
converge to a noncritical value. The scaling limit is an explicit convex subset
of the unit square $Q$ and its boundary has a flat component on the boundary of
$Q$. Finally, the highest macroscopic level line has $L_k^{1/3+o(1)}$
fluctuations along the flat part of the boundary of its limiting shape.

It has been recently shown that the infinite time limit of \rho_A(t) is

present some details on how to construct this ensemble in terms of local
integrals of motion, and show its equivalence to the expression in terms of
mode occupation numbers widely used in the literature. We then address the
question, how \rho_A(t) approaches \rho_{GGE,A} as a function of time. To that
end we introduce a distance on the space of density matrices and show that it
approaches zero as a universal power-law t^{-3/2} in time. As the RDM
completely determines all local observables within A, this provides information
on the relaxation of correlation functions of local operators. We then address
the issue, of how well a truncated generalized Gibbs ensemble with a finite
number of local higher conservation laws describes a given subsystem at late
times. We find that taking into account only local conservation laws with a
range at most comparable to the subsystem size provides a good description.
However, excluding even a single one of the most local conservation laws in
general completely spoils this agreement.

propagating in a material medium called ether. The speed c appearing in
Maxwell's wave equations was the speed of light with respect to the ether.
Therefore, according to the Galilean addition of velocities, the speed of light
in the laboratory would differ from c. The measure of such difference would
reveal the motion of the laboratory (the Earth) relative to the ether (a sort
of absolute motion). However the Earth's absolute motion was never evidenced.
  Galileo addition of velocities is based on the assumption that lengths and
time intervals are invariant (independent of the state of motion). This way of
thinking the spacetime emanates from our daily experience and lies at the heart
of Newton's Classical Mechanics. Nevertheless, in 1905 Einstein defied Galileo
addition of velocities by postulating that light travels at the same speed c in
any inertial frame. In doing so, Einstein extended the principle of relativity
to the electromagnetic phenomena described by Maxwell's laws. In Einstein's
Special Relativity the ether does not exist and the absolute motion is devoid
of meaning. The invariance of the speed of light forced the replacement of
Galileo transformations with Lorentz transformations. Thus, relativistic length
contractions and time dilations entered our understanding of the spacetime.
Newtonian mechanics had to be reformulated, which led to the discovery of the
mass-energy equivalence.

been suggested to be evolving with time, but the picture is far from clear.
While evidence for significant escape fractions has been found at high
redshifts in several studies, the picture looks different in the more nearby
universe. Here, we apply a new background subtraction routine on archival data
from the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE), in order to study local
galaxies in search for possible Lyman Continuum (LyC) leakage. In the process,
for the first time a stacked spectrum in the LyC is produced for local
galaxies. With this small sample, we also make a more tentative approach to
look for possible correlations between f_esc and physical parameters such as
internal absorption E(B-V)_i, mass, H I mass, specific star formation rate
(SSFR), metallicity, and Ly-alpha emission. Eight star forming galaxies with
redshifts z > 0.015 from the FUSE archive were re-examined. Also, a sub-sample
of an additional four galaxies with lower redshifts were included, for which
the escape fraction was estimated from residual flux in the low ionization
interstellar C II(1036{\AA}) line. Out of the eight galaxies, only one was
found to have significant LyC leakage, Tol 1247-232 (S/N=5.2). This is the
second detection of a leaking galaxy in the local universe. We find an absolute
escape fraction for Tol 1247-232 of f_esc = 2.4(+0.9/-0.8) %. The stacked
sample show an excess in the LyC with f_esc = 1.4(+0.6/-0.5) %, but we note
that there might be important selection biases involved. With the small sample,
we suggest a possible trend for higher f_esc with lower mass and with enhanced
SSFR. None of the galaxies with high values of E(B-V)_i were found to show any
sign of leakage.

It is assumed that stars of all masses contribute to nucleosynthesis by their
pre-explosive winds, but above a certain limiting main sequence mass, the
presupernova star becomes a black hole and ejects nothing more. The solar
abundances from oxygen to atomic mass 90 are fit quite well assuming no cut-off
at all, i.e., by assuming all stars up to 120 solar masses make successful
supernovae. Little degradation in the fit occurs if the upper limit is reduced
to 25 solar masses. The limit can be further reduced, but the required event
rate of supernovae in the remaining range rises rapidly to compensate for the
lost nucleosynthesis of the more massive stars. The nucleosynthesis of the
s-process declines precipitously and the production of species made in the
winds, e.g., carbon, becomes unacceptably large compared with elements made in
the explosion, e.g., silicon and oxygen. However, by varying uncertain physics,
especially the mass loss rate for massive stars and the rate for the neon-22 to
magnesium-25 reaction rate, acceptable nucleosynthesis might still be achieved
with a cutoff as low as 18 solar masses. This would require a supernova
frequency three times greater than the fiducial value obtained when all stars
explode in order to produce the required oxygen-16. The nucleosynthesis of

recent theory suggests that there are only a few key ""driver"" mutations

successes in developing drugs that treat cancers that carry these driver
mutations, several methods that rely on mutational clustering have been
developed to identify them. However, these methods consider proteins as a
single strand without taking their spatial structures into account. We propose
a new methodology that incorporates protein tertiary structure in order to
increase our power when identifying mutation clustering.
  Results: We have developed a novel algorithm, iPAC: identification of Protein
Amino acid Clustering, for the identification of non-random somatic mutations
in proteins that takes into account the three dimensional protein structure. By
using the tertiary information, we are able to detect both novel clusters in
proteins that are known to exhibit mutation clustering as well as identify
clusters in proteins without evidence of clustering based on existing methods.
For example, by combining the data in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the
Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer, our algorithm identifies new
mutational clusters in well known cancer proteins such as KRAS and PI3KCa.
Further, by utilizing the tertiary structure, our algorithm also identifies
clusters in EGFR, EIF2AK2, and other proteins that are not identified by

precisely we show that M admits such a metric if and only if its rational
Delzant polytope (which is a labelled quadrilateral) is K-polystable in the
relative, toric sense (as studied by S. Donaldson, E. Legendre, G. Szekelyhidi
et al.). Furthermore, in this case, the extremal Kaehler metric is ambitoric,
i.e., compatible with a conformally equivalent, oppositely oriented toric
Kaehler metric, which turns out to be extremal as well. These results provide a
computational test for the K-stability of labelled quadrilaterals.
  Extremal ambitoric structures were classified locally in Part I of this work,
but herein we only use the straightforward fact that explicit Kaehler metrics
obtained there are extremal, and the identification of Bach-flat (conformally
Einstein) examples among them. Using our global results, the latter yield
countably infinite families of compact toric Bach-flat Kaehler orbifolds,
including examples which are globally conformally Einstein, and examples which
are conformal to complete smooth Einstein metrics on an open subset, thus
extending the work of many authors.

non-vanishing cosmological constant. These Smarr relations display an
interesting symmetry between black holes and bubbles, being invariant under the
simultaneous interchange of the mass and black hole horizon area with the
tension and soliton bubble area. This property may indicate a symmetry between
the confining and deconfined phases of the dual gauge theory.

condition techniques reveal two different behaviours for the rotation frequency
of transient spiral arms like structures. Whereas unbarred disks present spiral
arms nearly corotatingwith disk particles, strong barred models (bulged or
bulge-less) quickly develop a bar-spiral structure dominant in density, with a
pattern speed almost constant in radius. As the bar strength decreases the arm
departs from bar rigid rotation and behaves similar to the unbarred case. In
strong barred models we detect in the frequency space other subdominant and
slower modes at large radii, in agreement with previous studies, however we
also detect them in the configuration space. We propose that the distinctive
behaviour of the dominant spiral modes can be exploited in order to constraint
the nature of Galactic spiral arms by the astrometric survey GAIA and by 2-D
spectroscopic surveys like CALIFA and MANGA in external galaxies.

all variants are unified by the matter trispectrum of squeezed configurations

the response of the power spectrum to a change in the background density. Our
method also applies to statistics that are based on radial projections of the

objects that assembled early, during the first billion years of cosmic time:
Obese Black-hole Galaxies (OBGs). OBGs are objects in which the mass of the
central black hole initially exceeds that of the stellar component of the host
galaxy, and the luminosity from black-hole accretion dominates the starlight.
From a cosmological simulation, we demonstrate that there are sites where star
formation is initially inhibited and direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs) form
due to the photo-dissociating effect of Lyman-Werner radiation on molecular
hydrogen. We show that the formation of OBGs is inevitable, because the
probability of finding the required extra-galactic environment and the right
physical conditions in a halo conducive to DCBH formation is quite high in the
early universe. We estimate an OBG number density of 0.009/Mpc^3 at z~8 and
0.03/Mpc^3 at z~6. Extrapolating from our simulation volume, we infer that the
most luminous quasars detected at z~6 likely transited through an earlier OBG
phase. We find that these primordial galaxies start off with an over-massive BH
and acquire their stellar component from subsequent merging as well as in-situ
star formation. In doing so, they inevitably go through an OBG phase dominated
by the accretion luminosity at the Eddington rate or below, released from the
growing BH. The OBG phase is characterised by an ultra-violet (UV) spectrum
with slope of beta ~ -2.3 and the absence of a Balmer Break. OBGs should also
be spatially unresolved, and are expected to be brighter than the majority of
known high-redshift galaxies. OBGs could potentially be revealed via HST
follow-up imaging of samples of brighter Lyman-break galaxies provided by
wide-area ground-based surveys such as UltraVISTA, and should be easily
uncovered and studied with instruments aboard JWST...(abridged)

most strongly modulated by dust attenuation, and is additionally correlated
with redshift, star-formation rate, and [OII] equivalent width, such that
systems at higher redshifts with lower dust levels, lower star-formation rates,
and larger [OII] equivalent widths show stronger FeII* emission. We detect MgII
emission in at least 15% of the individual spectra and we find that objects
showing stronger MgII emission have higher specific star-formation rates,
smaller [OII] linewidths, larger [OII] equivalent widths, lower dust
attenuations, and lower stellar masses than the sample as a whole. MgII
emission strength exhibits the strongest correlation with specific

stellar mass also play roles in the regulation of MgII emission. Future

rotational emission lines, and [C_{II}] fine-structure emission line from the
star-forming interstellar medium in the high-redshift submillimeter source HDF
850.1, at z = 5.183. We employ large velocity gradient (LVG) modeling to
analyze the spectra of this source assuming the [C_{II}] and CO emissions
originate from (i) separate unvirialized regions, (ii) separate virialized
regions, (iii) uniformly mixed unvirialized region, and (iv) uniformly mixed
virialized regions. We present the best fit set of parameters, including for
each case the ratio $\alpha$ between the total hydrogen/helium gas mass and the
CO(1-0) line luminosity. We also present computations of the ratio of H_{2}
mass to [C_{II}] line-luminosity for optically thin conditions, for a range of
gas temperatures and densities, for direct conversion of [C_{II}]
line-luminosities to ""dark-H_{2}"" masses. For HDF 850.1 we find that a model in
which the CO and C^{+} are uniformly mixed in gas that is shielded from UV
radiation, requires a cosmic-ray or X-ray ionization rate of $\zeta \approx$
10^{-13} s^{-1}, plausibly consistent with the large star-formation rate
($\sim$ 10^{3} M$_{\odot}$ yr^{-1}) observed in this source. Enforcing the
cosmological constraint posed by the abundance of dark matter halos in the
standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and taking into account other possible
contributions to the total gas mass, we find that three of these four models
are less likely at the 2$\sigma$ level. We conclude that modeling HDF 850.1's
ISM as a collection of unvirialized molecular clouds with distinct CO and C^{+}
layers, for which $\alpha$ = 0.6 M$_{\odot}$ (K km s^{-1} pc^{2})^{-1} for the
CO to H_{2} mass-to-luminosity ratio, (similar to the standard ULIRG value), is
most consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.

mass star where a detailed study of the structure of the planetary system can

discover planets around such stars using the radial velocity technique is to
observe 'retired' A stars, which are cooler and slower rotators compared to
their main-sequence counterparts. A planetary companion has already been
detected orbiting the subgiant Kappa CrB, with revised parameters of m sin i =
2.1MJ and apl = 2.8AU (Johnson et al. 2008a). We present additional Keck I
HIRES radial velocity measurements that provide evidence for a second planetary
companion, alongside Keck II AO imaging that places an upper limit on the mass
of this companion. Modelling of our Herschel images shows that the dust is
broadly distributed, but cannot distinguish between a single wide belt (from 20

existence of a second planetary companion beyond approximately 3AU it is
possible that the absence of dust within approximately 20AU is caused by
dynamical depletion, although the observations are not inconsistent with
depletion of these regions by collisional erosion, which occurs at higher rates
closer to the star.

extremely compact and low-power, but also variable and unreliable solid-state

quasielastic scattering spectra. The error invokes a valid calculation under
conditions in which its primary assumptions are incorrect, resulting in
misleading interpretations of spectra. Quasielastic scattering from dilute
probes yields the incoherent structure factor g^(1s)(q,t) = <exp(i q Dx(t))>,
with q being the magnitude of the scattering vector q and Dx(t) being the probe
displacement parallel to q during a time interval t. The error is a claim that
g^(1s)(q,t) ~ exp(- q^2 <(Dx(t))^2> /2) for probes in an arbitrary solution,
leading to the incorrect belief that <(Dx(t))^2 > of probes in complex fluids
can be inferred from quasielastic scattering. The actual theoretical result
refers only to monodisperse probes in simple Newtonian liquids. In general,
g^(1s)(q,t) is determined by all even moments <(Dx(t))^(2n) >, n = 1, 2, 3,...

hypergraph is known as the k-core. In this paper, we analyze parallel peeling
processes, where in each round, all vertices of degree less than k are removed.
It is known that, below a specific edge density threshold, the k-core is empty
with high probability. We show that, with high probability, below this
threshold, only (log log n)/log(k-1)(r-1) + O(1) rounds of peeling are needed
to obtain the empty k-core for r-uniform hypergraphs. Interestingly, we show
that above this threshold, Omega(log n) rounds of peeling are required to find
the non-empty k-core. Since most algorithms and data structures aim to peel to
an empty k-core, this asymmetry appears fortunate. We verify the theoretical
results both with simulation and with a parallel implementation using graphics

such as $p$-values, significance and confidence levels, is the relevant
sampling distribution. This feature results in violations of a principle known
as the strong likelihood principle (SLP), the focus of this paper. In
particular, if outcomes $\mathbf{x}^*$ and $\mathbf{y}^*$ from experiments
$E_1$ and $E_2$ (both with unknown parameter $\theta$) have different
probability models $f_1(\cdot),f_2(\cdot)$, then even though
$f_1(\mathbf{x}^*;\theta)=cf_2(\mathbf{y}^*;\theta)$ for all $\theta$, outcomes
$\mathbf{x}^*$ and $\mathbf{y}^*$ may have different implications for an
inference about $\theta$. Although such violations stem from considering
outcomes other than the one observed, we argue this does not require us to
consider experiments other than the one performed to produce the data. David
Cox [Ann. Math. Statist. 29 (1958) 357-372] proposes the Weak Conditionality
Principle (WCP) to justify restricting the space of relevant repetitions. The
WCP says that once it is known which $E_i$ produced the measurement, the
assessment should be in terms of the properties of $E_i$. The surprising upshot
of Allan Birnbaum's [J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 57 (1962) 269-306] argument is
that the SLP appears to follow from applying the WCP in the case of mixtures,
and so uncontroversial a principle as sufficiency (SP). But this would preclude
the use of sampling distributions. The goal of this article is to provide a new
clarification and critique of Birnbaum's argument. Although his argument
purports that [(WCP and SP) entails SLP], we show how data may violate the SLP
while holding both the WCP and SP. Such cases also refute [WCP entails SLP].

we formulate a new optimization problem, namely, \emph{Acceptance Probability

\emph{Selective Invitation with Tree and In-Node Aggregation (SITINA)}, to find
the optimal solution. We implement an active friending service with SITINA in

that SITINA outperforms manual selection and the baseline approach in solution

b= 13 kpc and 112 kpc. No absorption is detected in the four sightlines beyond
b=57 kpc. Of the six remaining sightlines, all of which lie at b<32 kpc and
within the N(HI)= 2E18 cm^{-2} boundary of the HI disk of M31, we detect
low-ionization absorption at M31 velocities along four of them (three of which
include MgII absorption). We also detect MgII absorption from an HVC. We find
that along sightlines where both are detected, the velocity location of the
low-ion gas tracks the peak in 21 cm emission. High-ionization absorption is
detected along the three inner sightlines, but not along the three outer
sightlines, for which CIV data exist. As inferred from 21 cm emission line
maps, only one sightline may have a damped Ly-alpha system. This sightline has
b= 17.5 kpc, and we detect both low- and high-ion absorption lines associated
with it.
  The impact parameters through M31 are similar to the impact parameters of
galaxies identified with MgII absorbers at redshifts 0.1<z<1.0 in a 2011 study
by Rao et al. However, the M31 MgII2796 rest equivalent width values are
significantly smaller. In comparison, moderate-to-strong MgII absorption from
Milky Way gas is detected along all ten sightlines. Thus, this study indicates
that M31 does not present itself as an absorbing galaxy which is typical of
higher-redshift galaxies inferred to give rise to moderate-strength quasar
absorption lines. M31 also appears not to possess an extensive large gaseous
cross section, at least not along the direction of its major axis. (Abridged.)

an avalanche of spin flips to become infinite is that it interacts in an
optimal way with previously flipped spins. Based on these criteria, we explain
why an infinite avalanche can occur in q-regular graphs only for q>3, and
suggest that this criterion might be relevant for other systems. The generating
function techniques developed for branching processes are applied to obtain
analytical expressions for the duration, pulse-shapes and power spectrum of the

scale core networks to meet increasingly dynamic capacity demands. Past work
has focused on designing the network to support all hose matrices (all matrices
not exceeding marginal bounds at the nodes). This model may be too conservative
if additional information on traffic patterns is available. Another extreme is
the fixed demand model, where one designs the network to support peak
point-to-point demands. We introduce a capped hose model to explore a broader
range of traffic matrices which includes the above two as special cases. It is
known that optimal designs for the hose model are always determined by
single-hub routing, and for the fixed- demand model are based on shortest-path
routing. We shed light on the wider space of capped hose matrices in order to
see which traffic models are more shortest path-like as opposed to hub-like. To
address the space in between, we use hierarchical multi-hub routing templates,
a generalization of hub and tree routing. In particular, we show that by adding
peak capacities into the hose model, the single-hub tree-routing template is no
longer cost-effective. This initiates the study of a class of robust network
design (RND) problems restricted to these templates. Our empirical analysis is
based on a heuristic for this new hierarchical RND problem. We also propose
that it is possible to define a routing indicator that accounts for the
strengths of the marginals and peak demands and use this information to choose
the appropriate routing template. We benchmark our approach against other
well-known routing templates, using representative carrier networks and a
variety of different capped hose traffic demands, parameterized by the relative
importance of their marginals as opposed to their point-to-point peak demands.

enhanced decay rate of h to \gamma\gamma\ at large tan \beta. We also suggest a
\tau-phobic Higgs scenario in which the lightest Higgs can have suppressed
couplings to down-type fermions. We propose to supplement the specified value
of the \mu\ parameter in some of these scenarios with additional values of both
signs. This has a significant impact on the interpretation of searches for the
non SM-like MSSM Higgs bosons. We also discuss the sensitivity of the searches
to heavy Higgs decays into light charginos and neutralinos, and to decays of
the form H to hh. Finally, in addition to all the other scenarios where the
lightest CP-even Higgs is interpreted as the LHC signal, we propose a low-MH
scenario, where instead the heavy CP-even Higgs boson corresponds to the new
state around 125.5 GeV.

Here, oscillations arise as consequence of interaction between an ion and the

provides an elegant explanation to why self-sustained oscillations occur only

(ISM) on the strength and the shape of the Lyman alpha (Lya) line in starburst
galaxies. Methods: Using our 3D Monte Carlo Lya radiation transfer code, we
study the radiative transfer of Lya, UV and optical continuum photons in
homogeneous and clumpy shells of neutral hydrogen and dust surrounding a
central source. Our simulations predict the Lya and continuum escape fraction,
the Lya equivalent width EW(Lya), the Lya line profile and their dependence on
the gas geometry and the main input physical parameters. Results: The ISM
clumpiness is found to have a strong impact on the Lya line radiative transfer,
entailing a strong dependence of the emergent features of the Lya line (escape
fraction, EW(Lya)) on the ISM morphology. Although a clumpy and dusty ISM
appears more transparent to radiation (both line and continuum) compared to an
equivalent homogeneous ISM of equal dust optical depth, we find that the Lya
photons are, in general, still more attenuated than UV continuum radiation. As
a consequence, the observed Lya equivalent width (EWobs(Lya)) is lower than the
intrinsic one (EWint(Lya)) for nearly all clumpy ISM configurations considered.
There are, however, special conditions under which Lya photons escape more
easily than the continuum, resulting in an enhanced EWobs(Lya). The requirement
for this to happen is that the ISM is almost static (galactic outflows < 200
km/s), extremely clumpy (with density contrasts >10^7 in HI between clumps and
the interclump medium), and very dusty (E(B-V) > 0.30). When these conditions
are fulfilled the emergent Lya line profile shows no velocity shift and little
asymmetry. Given the asymmetry and velocity shifts generally observed in
starburst galaxies with Lya emission, we conclude that clumping is unlikely to
significantly enhance their relative Lya/UV transmission.

simultaneous algebraic operator equations, $C^2=1$, $[C,PT]=0$, and $[C,H]=0$.
These equations are difficult to solve exactly, so perturbative methods have
been used in the past to calculate C. The usual approach has been to express
the Hamiltonian as $H=H_0+\epsilon H_1$, and to seek a solution for C in the
form $C=e^Q P$, where $Q=Q(q,p)$ is odd in the momentum p, even in the
coordinate q, and has a perturbation expansion of the form $Q=\epsilon
Q_1+\epsilon^3 Q_3+\epsilon^5 Q_5+\ldots$. [In previous work it has always been
assumed that the coefficients of even powers of $\epsilon$ in this expansion
would be absent because their presence would violate the condition that
$Q(p,q)$ is odd in p.] In an earlier paper it was argued that the C operator is
not unique because the perturbation coefficient $Q_1$ is nonunique. Here, the
nonuniqueness of C is demonstrated at a more fundamental level: It is shown
that the perturbation expansion for Q actually has the more general form
$Q=Q_0+\epsilon Q_1+\epsilon^2 Q_2+\ldots$ in which {\it all} powers and not
just odd powers of $\epsilon$ appear. For the case in which $H_0$ is the
harmonic-oscillator Hamiltonian, $Q_0$ is calculated exactly and in closed form
and it is shown explicitly to be nonunique. The results are verified by using
powerful summation procedures based on analytic continuation. It is also shown
how to calculate the higher coefficients in the perturbation series for Q.

for the size of the broad line region (BLR) in NGC 4051; an inner radius ~3
lt-days and a lower limit to the outer radius ~ 475 lt-days. Thus, the

n=10 and n=8, respectively, were generated, and their rotation sustained, by
means of rotating magnetic perturbations of the same n. Due to finite EFs, and
in spite of the applied perturbations rotating uniformly and having constant
amplitude, the kink modes were observed to rotate non-uniformly and be
modulated in amplitude. This behavior was used to precisely infer the amplitude
and approximately estimate the toroidal phase of the EF. A subsequent scan
permitted to optimize the toroidal phase. The technique was tested against
deliberately applied as well as intrinsic error fields of n=8 and 10.
Corrections equal and opposite to the estimated error fields were applied. The
efficacy of the error compensation was indicated by the increased discharge
duration and more uniform mode rotation in response to a uniformly rotating

real-time use of the signals. In fact, a simple toroidal extrapolation was
sufficient to lock the modulation to the O-point phase. This was accomplished
by a specially designed phase shifter of nearly flat response over the 1-7kHz
range. Moreover, correlation analysis of two channels slightly above and below
the ECCD frequency allowed checking the radial alignment to the island, based
on the fact that for satisfactory alignment the two signals are out of phase.

meminductive systems. In particular, by employing the well-known theory of
response functions and microscopic derivations, we show that resistors,
capacitors and inductors with memory emerge naturally in the response of
systems - especially those of nanoscale dimensions - subjected to external
perturbations. As a consequence, since memristances, memcapacitances, and
meminductances are simply response functions, they are not necessarily finite.
This means that, unlike what has always been argued in some literature,
diverging and non-crossing input-output curves of all these memory elements are
physically possible in both quantum and classical regimes. For similar reasons,
it is not surprising to find memcapacitances and meminductances that acquire
negative values at certain times during dynamics, while the passivity criterion
of memristive systems imposes always a non-negative value on the resistance at
any given time. We finally show that ideal memristors, namely those whose state
depends only on the charge that flows through them (or on the history of the
voltage) are subject to very strict physical conditions and are unable to
protect their memory state against the unavoidable fluctuations, and therefore
are susceptible to a stochastic catastrophe. Similar considerations apply to
ideal memcapacitors and meminductors.

ejecta from these explosions shock the circumstellar matter originating from
the mass loss of the progenitor during the final phases of its life. This
interaction accelerates particles to relativistic energies which then lose
energy via synchrotron radiation in the shock-amplified magnetic fields and
inverse Compton scattering against optical photons from the supernova. These
processes produce different signatures in the radio and X-ray part of the
electromagnetic spectrum. Observed together, they allow us to break the

the ATCA to study the relative importance of processes which accelerate

mass loss from the progenitor. The ejecta expands into a low density bubble
followed by interaction with a higher density wind from a red supergiant

However, many commonly used methods to predict these effects perform poorly in

non-alanine substitutions, and flexible loops are difficult to predict with
available tools and protocols. We present here an existing method applied in a
novel way to a new test case; we interrogate affinity differences resulting
from mutations in a host-virus protein-protein interface. We use steered
molecular dynamics (SMD) to computationally pull the machupo virus (MACV) spike
glycoprotein (GP1) away from the human transferrin receptor (hTfR1). We then
approximate affinity using the maximum applied force of separation and the area
under the force-versus-distance curve. We find, even without the rigor and
planning required for free energy calculations, that these quantities can
provide novel biophysical insight into the GP1/hTfR1 interaction. First, with
no prior knowledge of the system we can differentiate among wild type and
mutant complexes. Moreover, we show that this simple SMD scheme correlates well
with relative free energy differences computed via free energy perturbation.
Second, although the static co-crystal structure shows two large
hydrogen-bonding networks in the GP1/hTfR1 interface, our simulations indicate
that one of them may not be important for tight binding. Third, one viral site
known to be critical for infection may mark an important evolutionary
suppressor site for infection-resistant hTfR1 mutants. Finally, our approach
provides a framework to compare the effects of multiple mutations, individually

$C^{1,1}$-regularity assumption on the boundary data and the $d$-th root of the

representation of a random process from a collection of scattered pointwise
samples. The present work specifically focuses onto random quantities lying in
a high dimensional stochastic space in the context of limited amount of
information. The proposed approach involves a procedure for the selection of an
approximation basis and the evaluation of the associated coefficients. The
selection of the approximation basis relies on the a priori choice of the
High-Dimensional Model Representation format combined with a modified Least
Angle Regression technique. The resulting basis then provides the structure for
the actual approximation basis, possibly using different functions, more
parsimonious and nonlinear in its coefficients. To evaluate the coefficients,
both an alternate least squares and an alternate weighted total least squares
methods are employed. Examples are provided for the approximation of a random
variable in a high-dimensional space as well as the estimation of a random
field. Stochastic dimensions up to 100 are considered, with an amount of
information as low as about 3 samples per dimension, and robustness of the
approximation is demonstrated w.r.t. noise in the dataset. The computational
cost of the solution method is shown to scale only linearly with the
cardinality of the a priori basis and exhibits a (N_q)^s, 2 <= s <= 3,
dependence with the number N_q of samples in the dataset. The provided
numerical experiments illustrate the ability of the present approach to derive
an accurate approximation from scarce scattered data even in the presence of

with the means of organizing what would otherwise be unstructured collections.
They can help us cluster a huge collection into different topics or find a
subset of the collection that resembles the topical theme found in an article

  The first wave of topic models developed were able to discover the prevailing
topics in a big collection of documents spanning a period of time. It was later
realized that these time-invariant models were not capable of modeling 1) the
time varying number of topics they discover and 2) the time changing structure
of these topics. Few models were developed to address this two deficiencies.
The online-hierarchical Dirichlet process models the documents with a time
varying number of topics. It varies the structure of the topics over time as
well. However, it relies on document order, not timestamps to evolve the model
over time. The continuous-time dynamic topic model evolves topic structure in
continuous-time. However, it uses a fixed number of topics over time.
  In this dissertation, I present a model, the continuous-time infinite dynamic
topic model, that combines the advantages of these two models 1) the
online-hierarchical Dirichlet process, and 2) the continuous-time dynamic topic
model. More specifically, the model I present is a probabilistic topic model
that does the following: 1) it changes the number of topics over continuous
time, and 2) it changes the topic structure over continuous-time.
  I compared the model I developed with the two other models with different
setting values. The results obtained were favorable to my model and showed the
need for having a model that has a continuous-time varying number of topics and

CI techniques found their way to many control engineering applications,
including system identification, and the results obtained by many researchers
were encouraging. However, most control engineers and researchers used the
basic CI models as is or slightly modified them to match their needs.
Henceforth, the merits of one model over the other was not clear, and full
potential of these models was not exploited.
  In this research, Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization
(PSO) methods, which are different CI techniques, are modified to best suit the
multimodal problem of system identification. In the first case of GA, an
extension to the basic algorithm, which is inspired from nature as well, was
deployed by introducing redundant genetic material. This extension, which come
in handy in living organisms, did not result in significant performance
improvement to the basic algorithm. In the second case, the Clubs-based PSO
(C-PSO) dynamic neighborhood structure was introduced to replace the basic
static structure used in canonical PSO algorithms. This modification of the
neighborhood structure resulted in significant performance of the algorithm
regarding convergence speed, and equipped it with a tool to handle multimodal
problems.
  To understand the suitability of different GA and PSO techniques in the
problem of system identification, they were used in an induction motor's
parameter identification problem. The results enforced previous conclusions and
showed the superiority of PSO in general over the GA in such a multimodal

of abolishing conventional approximations and using only a few assumptions. Our

uncertainties of astrometric observations. We discuss how the determinations of
the LDMD vary with observational precisions on parallax, proper motion, and
line-of-sight velocity measurements. To examine the influences by the
observational imprecision, we created mock observation data for stars that are
dynamical tracers based on an analytical galaxy model and applied parametrized
observational errors to the mock data. We evaluated the accuracy of determining
the LDMD by applying the method to the mock data. In addition, we estimated a
sample size and observational precision required to determine the LDMD with
accuracy. We find that the method is capable of determining the LDMD with
accuracy if the sample size and observational precisions are satisfactory. The
random errors of parallaxes and proper motions can cause systematic
overestimation of the LDMD. We estimate the required precisions of the parallax
measurements to be approximately 0.1-0.3 milliarcseconds at 1 kpc away from the
Sun; the proper motion precisions do not seem to be as important as the
parallaxes. From these results, we expect that using the Hipparcos catalog
would overestimate the LDMD because of the imprecise parallax measurements if
this method is applied; however, we emphasize the capability of the method. We
expect that Gaia will provide data precise enough to determine the LDMD.

associated with slow long duration events (LDEs), i.e. flares with the long

analyzed the CME kinematics in detail. The parameters of the flares (GOES flux,
duration of the rising phase) show strong correlations with the CME parameters
(velocity, acceleration during main acceleration phase and duration of the CME
acceleration phase). These correlations confirm the strong relation between
slow LDEs and CMEs. We also analyzed the relation between the parameters of the
CMEs, i.e. a velocity, an acceleration during the main acceleration phase, a
duration of the acceleration phase, and a height of a CME at the end of the
acceleration phase. The CMEs associated with the slow LDEs are characterized by
high velocity during the propagation phase, with the median equal 1423 km/s. In
half of the analyzed cases, the main acceleration was low (a<300 m/s^2), which
suggests that the high velocity is caused by the prolongated acceleration phase
(the median for the duration of the acceleration phase is equal 90 minutes).
The CMEs were accelerated up to several solar radii (with the median 7 Rsun),
which is much higher than in typical impulsive CMEs. Therefore, slow LDEs may
potentially precede extremely strong geomagnetic storms. The analysis of slow
LDEs and associated CMEs may give important information for developing more
accurate space weather forecasts, especially for extreme events.

simply $k$-SGE, is to find a set $P$ of $n$ points in the plane and a bijection
$\phi: V \to P$ such that the induced straight-line drawings of $G_1,\dots,G_k$
under $\phi$ are all plane.
  This problem is polynomial-time equivalent to weak rectilinear realizability
of abstract topological graphs, which Kyn\v{c}l (doi:10.1007/s00454-010-9320-x)
proved to be complete for $\exists\mathbb{R}$, the existential theory of the
reals. Hence the problem $k$-SGE is polynomial-time equivalent to several other
problems in computational geometry, such as recognizing intersection graphs of
line segments or finding the rectilinear crossing number of a graph.
  We give an elementary reduction from the pseudoline stretchability problem to
$k$-SGE, with the property that both numbers $k$ and $n$ are linear in the
number of pseudolines. This implies not only the $\exists\mathbb{R}$-hardness
result, but also a $2^{2^{\Omega (n)}}$ lower bound on the minimum size of a
grid on which any such simultaneous embedding can be drawn. This bound is
tight. Hence there exists such collections of graphs that can be simultaneously
embedded, but every simultaneous drawing requires an exponential number of bits
per coordinates. The best value that can be extracted from Kyn\v{c}l's proof is
only $2^{2^{\Omega (\sqrt{n})}}$.

test for the cosmological distance scale. First, because Fornax is the 2nd

has a small line-of-sight depth; and second, because NGC1316 is the galaxy with
the largest number of detected SNeIa, giving the opportunity to test the
consistency of SNeIa distances internally and against other indicators.
  We measure SBF mags in NGC1316 from ground and space-based imaging data,
providing a homogeneous set of measurements over a wide wavelength interval.
The SBF, coupled with empirical and theoretical calibrations, are used to
estimate the distance to the galaxy. We present the first B-band SBF
measurements of NGC1316 and use them together with the optical and near-IR SBF
data to analyze the properties of field stars.
  Our distance modulus m-M=31.59 +-0.05(stat) +-0.14(sys), when placed in a
consistent Cepheid distance scale, agrees with the results from other
indicators. However, our result is ~17% larger than the most recent estimate
based on SNeIa. Possible explanations for this disagreement are the
uncertainties on internal extinction, or calibration issues. Concerning the
stellar population analysis, we confirm earlier results from other indicators:
the field stars in NGC1316 are dominated by a solar metallicity, intermediate
age component. A substantial mismatch exists between B-band SBF models and
data, a behavior that can be accounted for by an enhanced percentage of hot
horizontal branch stars.
  Our study of the SBF distance to NGC1316, and the comparison with distances
from other indicators, raises some concern about the homogeneity between the
calibrations of different indicators. If not properly placed in the same
reference scale, significant differences can occur, with dramatic impact on the
cosmological distance ladder.

characteristic aspect ratio of the columnar convection cells are all predicted
to be power-law functions of two observable quantities: the magnetic dipole
moment and the planetary rotation rate. The resulting scaling laws constitute a
somewhat modified version of the scalings proposed in Christensen & Aubert
(2006) and Christensen (2010). The main difference is that, in view of the
small value of the Rossby number in planetary cores, we insist that the
nonlinear inertial term, (u.grad)u, is negligible. This changes the exponents
in the power-laws which relate the various properties of the fluid dynamo to
the planetary dipole moment and rotation rate. Our scaling laws are consistent

illustrated by a detailed study of B\""acklund transformations for Toda-type

to consistency of the system of discrete multi-time Euler-Lagrange equations.
The precise meaning of the commutativity in the periodic case, when all maps
are double-valued, is established. It is shown that gluing of different
branches is governed by the so called superposition formulas. The closure
relation for the multi-time Lagrangian 1-form on solutions of the variational
equations is proved for all Toda-type systems. Superposition formulas are
instrumental for this proof. The closure relation was previously shown to be
equivalent to the spectrality property of B\""acklund transformations, i.e., to
the fact that the derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to the spectral
parameter is a common integral of motion of the family of B\""acklund
transformations. We relate this integral of motion to the monodromy matrix of
the zero curvature representation which is derived directly from equations of
motion in an algorithmic way. This serves as a further evidence in favor of the
idea that B\""acklund transformations serve as zero curvature representations
for themselves.

(Biferale et al., Phys. Fluids (2005)), we show that the probability of having
a stretching-tilting larger than twice the local enstrophy is negligible. By
using an anisotropic filter in the Fourier space we analyze these survival
statistics when the large, the small inertial or the small inertial and
dissipation scales are filtered out. The probability that the ratio (|{\omega}
\dot U|/|{\omega}|^2) is higher than a given threshold is higher in the
unfiltered isotropic field than in the fields where the large scales were
filtered out and is lower than in the fields were the small inertial and
dissipative scales are filtered out. This is due to the suppression of compact
structures in the removed ranges. The partial removal of the background of
filaments and sheets does not have a first order effect on these statistics.
These results are discussed in the light of a hypothesized relation between
vortical filaments, sheets and blobs. The study can be viewed as a test for
this idea and tries to highlight its limits. A qualitative relation in physical
space and in Fourier space can be supposed to exist for blobs only. That is for
the near isotropic structures which are sufficiently described by a single
spatial scale and do not suffer from the disambiguation problem as filaments
and sheets do. Information is also given on the filtering effect on the angles
between the strain rate tensor eigenvectors and the vorticity: eigenvector 2
reduces its alignment, while eigenvector 3 reduces its misalignment. All
filters increase the gap between the most extensional eigenvalue and the
intermediate one and the gap between this last and the contractile eigenvalue.
When the large scales are missing, eigenvalue modulus 1 and 3 become nearly
equal, similar to the modulus of the related components of the enstrophy
production.

galaxy formation predicted that the fraction of star-forming galaxies at z~0.9
decreases with increasing the projected galaxy density even if the effects of
the projection and the photo-z error in our analysis were taken into account.
The fraction of [OII] emitters decreases from ~60% at z~1.2 to ~30% at z~0.9

uncertainty quantification in such settings, for which we propose and review a
general multi-stage procedure called ensemble copula coupling (ECC), proceeding
as follows: 1. Generate a raw ensemble, consisting of multiple runs of the
computer model that differ in the inputs or model parameters in suitable ways.
2. Apply statistical postprocessing techniques, such as Bayesian model
averaging or nonhomogeneous regression, to correct for systematic errors in the
raw ensemble, to obtain calibrated and sharp predictive distributions for each
univariate output variable individually. 3. Draw a sample from each
postprocessed predictive distribution. 4. Rearrange the sampled values in the
rank order structure of the raw ensemble to obtain the ECC postprocessed
ensemble. The use of ensembles and statistical postprocessing have become
routine in weather forecasting over the past decade. We show that seemingly
unrelated, recent advances can be interpreted, fused and consolidated within
the framework of ECC, the common thread being the adoption of the empirical
copula of the raw ensemble. Depending on the use of Quantiles, Random draws or
Transformations at the sampling stage, we distinguish the ECC-Q, ECC-R and
ECC-T variants, respectively. We also describe relations to the Schaake shuffle
and extant copula-based techniques. In a case study, the ECC approach is
applied to predictions of temperature, pressure, precipitation and wind over
Germany, based on the 50-member European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
Forecasts (ECMWF) ensemble.

of < 0.05 dex by using the global seismic quantities Deltanu and nu_max along
with Teff and [Fe/H]. Surface gravity is also one of the four stellar
properties to be derived by automatic analyses for 1 billion stars from Gaia
data (workpackage GSP_Phot). We explore seismic data from MS F, G, K stars
(solar-like stars) observed by Kepler as a potential calibration source for
methods that Gaia will use for object characterisation (log g). We calculate
log g for bright nearby stars for which radii and masses are known, and using
their global seismic quantities in a grid-based method, we determine an
asteroseismic log g to within 0.01 dex of the direct calculation, thus
validating the accuracy of our method. We find that errors in Teff and mainly
[Fe/H] can cause systematic errors of 0.02 dex. We then apply our method to a
list of 40 stars to deliver precise values of surface gravity, i.e. sigma <
0.02 dex, and we find agreement with recent literature values. Finally, we
explore the precision we expect in a sample of 400+ Kepler stars which have
their global seismic quantities measured. We find a mean uncertainty
(precision) on the order of <0.02 dex in log g over the full explored range 3.8
< log g < 4.6, with the mean value varying only with stellar magnitude (0.01 -
0.02 dex). We study sources of systematic errors in log g and find possible
biases on the order of 0.04 dex, independent of log g and magnitude, which
accounts for errors in the Teff and [Fe/H] measurements, as well as from using
a different grid-based method. We conclude that Kepler stars provide a wealth
of reliable information that can help to calibrate methods that Gaia will use,
in particular, for source characterisation with GSP_Phot where excellent
precision (small uncertainties) and accuracy in log g is obtained from seismic
data.

determines a natural conformal structure $c_D$ on $M$; these conformal
structures are exactly those (on oriented $M$) whose normal conformal holonomy
is contained in the (split, real) simple Lie group $G_2$. Graham and Willse
showed that for real-analytic $D$ the same holds for the holonomy of the

groups are equal to $G_2$ for almost all $D$. We investigate here independently
interesting plane fields for which the associated holonomy groups are a proper

  Cartan solved the local equivalence problem for $2$-plane fields $D$ and
constructed the fundamental curvature tensor $A$ for these objects. He
furthermore claimed to describe locally all $D$ whose infinitesimal symmetry
algebra has rank at least $6$ and gave a local quasi-normal form, depending on
a single function of one variable, for those that furthermore satisfy a natural
degeneracy condition on $A$, but Doubrov and Govorov recently rediscovered a
counterexample to Cartan's claim. We show that for all $D$ given by Cartan's

Nurowski's construction are almost Einstein, that we can write their ambient
metrics explicitly, and that the holonomy groups associated to $c_D$ are always
the $5$-dimensional Heisenberg group, which here acts indecomposably but not
irreducibly. (Not all of these properties hold, however, for Doubrov and
Govorov's counterexample.) We also show that the similar results hold for the

clearly different proper motions from those of the foreground associations and
of the background stars. The data suggest that Chamaeleon II could have
different dynamical properties from Chamaeleon I. Although the two foreground
clusters \epsilon and \eta Chamaeleontis constitute two different proper motion
groups, they have similar spatial motions, which are different from the spatial
motion of Chamaeleon I. On the other hand, the space motions of the Chamaeleon

Chamaeleon I stars, but the numbers are low. Hence, with the available data it
is unclear to what extent the stellar populations in both clouds are physically

proved to be an attractive context for the study of nonlinear dynamics and
quantum effects at the macroscopic scale. Recently, atomic BECs have been used
to investigate quantum turbulence both experimentally and theoretically,
stimulated largely by the high degree of control which is available within
these quantum gases. In this article we motivate the use of atomic BECs for the
study of turbulence, discuss the characteristic regimes of turbulence which are
accessible, and briefly review some selected investigations of quantum
turbulence and recent results. We focus on three stages of turbulence - the
generation of turbulence, its steady state and its decay - and highlight some
fundamental questions regarding our understanding in each of these regimes.

large class of spherically symmetric spacetimes using periodicity in the
Euclidean sector and this procedure works for the de Sitter spacetime as well.
But, unlike e.g., the black hole spacetimes, the de Sitter spacetime also
allows a description in Friedmann coordinates. This raises the question of
whether the thermality of the de Sitter horizon can be obtained, working
entirely in the Friedmann coordinates, without reference to the static
coordinates or using the symmetries of de Sitter spacetime. We discuss several
aspects of this issue for de Sitter and approximately de Sitter spacetimes, in
the Friedmann coordinates (with a time-dependent background and the associated
ambiguities in defining the vacuum states). The different choices for the
vacuum states, behaviour of the mode functions and the detector response are
studied in both (1+1) and (1+3) dimensions. We compare and contrast the
differences brought about by the different choices. In the last part of the
paper, we also describe a general procedure for studying quantum field theory
in spacetimes which are approximately de Sitter and, as an example, derive the
corrections to thermal spectrum due to the presence of pressure-free matter.

  Systems",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a method to apply the popular cascade classifier
into face recognition to improve the computational efficiency while keeping
high recognition rate. In large scale face recognition systems, because the
probability of feature templates coming from different subjects is very high,
most of the matching pairs will be rejected by the early stages of the cascade.
Therefore, the cascade can improve the matching speed significantly. On the
other hand, using the nested structure of the cascade, we could drop some
stages at the end of feature to reduce the memory and bandwidth usage in some
resources intensive system while not sacrificing the performance too much. The
cascade is learned by two steps. Firstly, some kind of prepared features are
grouped into several nested stages. And then, the threshold of each stage is
learned to achieve user defined verification rate (VR). In the paper, we take a
landmark based Gabor+LDA face recognition system as baseline to illustrate the
process and advantages of the proposed method. However, the use of this method
is very generic and not limited in face recognition, which can be easily
generalized to other biometrics as a post-processing module. Experiments on the
FERET database show the good performance of our baseline and an experiment on a
self-collected large scale database illustrates that the cascade can improve
the matching speed significantly.

formation of UCXBs and their evolution, such as the onset of mass transfer and
late-time behavior. Methods. The binary population synthesis code SeBa and
stellar evolutionary tracks are used to model the UCXB population. The
luminosity behavior of UCXBs is predicted using long-term X-ray observations of
the known UCXBs and the thermal-viscous disk instability model. Results. In our
model, the majority of UCXBs initially have a helium burning star donor. In the
absence of a mechanism that destroys old UCXBs, we predict (0.2 - 1.9) x 10^5
UCXBs in the Galactic Bulge, mostly at orbital periods longer than 60 min (a
large number of long-period systems also follows from the observed short-period
UCXB population). About 5 - 50 UCXBs should be brighter than 10^35 erg/s,
mostly persistent sources with orbital periods shorter than 30 min and with
degenerate helium and carbon-oxygen donors. This is one order of magnitude more
than the observed number of (probably) three. Conclusions. This overprediction
of short-period UCXBs implies that fewer systems are formed, or that a
super-Eddington mass transfer rate is more difficult to survive than assumed.
The very small number of observed long-period UCXBs with respect to
short-period UCXBs, the surprisingly high luminosity of the observed UCXBs with
orbital periods around 50 min, and the properties of the PSR J1719-1438 system
all point to much faster UCXB evolution than expected from angular momentum
loss via gravitational wave radiation alone. Old UCXBs, if they still exist,
probably have orbital periods longer than 2 h and have become very faint due to
either reduced accretion or quiescence, or have become detached. UCXBs are
promising candidate progenitors of isolated millisecond radio pulsars.

Characterised by clearly defined ripple structures, Kinneyia are generally
found in areas that were formally littoral habitats and covered by microbial
mats. To date there has been no conclusive explanation of the processes
involved in the formation of these fossils. Microbial mats behave like
viscoelastic fluids. We propose that the key mechanism involved in the
formation of Kinneyia is a Kelvin-Helmholtz type instability induced in a
viscoelastic film under flowing water. A ripple corrugation is spontaneously
induced in the film and grows in amplitude over time. Theoretical predictions
show that the ripple instability has a wavelength proportional to the thickness
of the film. Experiments carried out using viscoelastic films confirm this
prediction. The ripple pattern that forms has a wavelength roughly three times
the thickness of the film. This behaviour is independent of the viscosity of
the film and the flow conditions. Laboratory-analogue Kinneyia were formed via
the sedimentation of glass beads, which preferentially deposit in the troughs
of the ripples. Well-ordered patterns form, with both honeycomb-like and
parallel ridges being observed, depending on the flow speed. These patterns
correspond well with those found in Kinneyia, with similar morphologies,
wavelengths and amplitudes being observed.

restore a satisfying locality principle. Separability here means that all
events associated to the union of some set of disjoint regions are combinations
of events associated to each region taken separately.
  In this article, it is shown that: (a) localised events can be consistently
defined without implying separability; (b) the definition of Bell's locality
condition does not rely on separability in any way; (c) the proof of Bell's
theorem does not use separability as an assumption. If, inspired by
considerations of non-separability, the assumptions of Bell's theorem are
weakened, what remains no longer embodies the locality principle. Teller's
argument for ""relational holism"" and Howard's arguments concerning separability
are criticised in the light of these results. Howard's claim that Einstein
grounded his arguments on the incompleteness of QM with a separability
assumption is also challenged. Instead, Einstein is better interpreted as
referring merely to the existence of localised events. Finally, it is argued
that Bell rejected the idea that separability is an assumption of his theorem.

are spaced 21.7 mutual Hill radii apart with a standard deviation of 9.5. This
dynamical spacing distribution is consistent with that of adjacent planets in
the Solar System. To test the packed planetary systems hypothesis, the idea
that all planetary systems are dynamically packed or filled to capacity, we
determined the fraction of systems that are dynamically packed by performing
long-term (10^8 years) numerical simulations. In each simulation, we integrated
a system with planets spaced according to our best-fit dynamical spacing
distribution but containing an additional planet on an intermediate orbit. The
fraction of simulations exhibiting signs of instability provides an approximate
lower bound on the fraction of systems that are dynamically packed; we found
that >31%, >35%, and >45% of 2-planet, 3-planet, and 4-planet systems are

pressure correction has to be solved at every time step in the dynamical core
of many numerical weather prediction models, and equations of a very similar
structure arise in global ocean models, subsurface flow simulations and gas and
oil reservoir modelling. The elliptic solve is often the bottleneck of the
forecast, and an algorithmically optimal method has to be used and implemented
efficiently. Graphics Processing Units have been shown to be highly efficient
for a wide range of applications in scientific computing, and recently
iterative solvers have been parallelised on these architectures. We describe
the GPU implementation and optimisation of a Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient
(PCG) algorithm for the solution of a three dimensional anisotropic elliptic
PDE for the pressure correction in NWP. Our implementation exploits the strong
vertical anisotropy of the elliptic operator in the construction of a suitable
preconditioner. As the algorithm is memory bound, performance can be improved
significantly by reducing the amount of global memory access. We achieve this
by using a matrix-free implementation which does not require explicit storage
of the matrix and instead recalculates the local stencil. Global memory access
can also be reduced by rewriting the algorithm using loop fusion and we show
that this further reduces the runtime on the GPU. We demonstrate the
performance of our matrix-free GPU code by comparing it to a sequential CPU
implementation and to a matrix-explicit GPU code which uses existing libraries.
The absolute performance of the algorithm for different problem sizes is
quantified in terms of floating point throughput and global memory bandwidth.

coalitional game and pricing in this paper. There are several vehicles and
roadside units (RSUs) in the networks. Each vehicle has a desire to transmit
with a certain probability, which represents its data burtiness. The RSUs can
enhance the vehicles' transmissions by cooperatively relaying the vehicles'
data. We consider two kinds of cooperations: cooperation among the vehicles and
cooperation between the vehicle and RSU. First, vehicles cooperate to avoid
interfering transmissions by scheduling the transmissions of the vehicles in
each coalition. Second, a RSU can join some coalition to cooperate the
transmissions of the vehicles in that coalition. Moreover, due to the mobility
of the vehicles, we introduce the notion of encounter between the vehicle and
RSU to indicate the availability of the relay in space. To stimulate the RSU's
cooperative relaying for the vehicles, the pricing mechanism is applied. A
non-transferable utility (NTU) game is developed to analyze the behaviors of
the vehicles and RSUs. The stability of the formulated game is studied.
Finally, we present and discuss the numerical results for the 2-vehicle and
2-RSU scenario, and the numerical results verify the theoretical analysis.

these time-variable instrumental speckles, and especially their interaction
with other aberrations, referred to as the pinning effect, is paramount for the
search of faint stellar companions. The temporal evolution of quasi-static
speckles is for instance required for a quantification of the gain expected
when using angular differential imaging (ADI), and to determine the interval on
which speckle nulling techniques must be carried out. Following an early
analysis of a time series of adaptively corrected, coronagraphic images
obtained in a laboratory condition with the High-Order Test bench (HOT) at ESO
Headquarters, we confirm our results with new measurements carried out with the
SPHERE instrument during its final test phase in Europe. The analysis of the
residual speckle pattern in both direct and differential coronagraphic images
enables the characterization of the temporal stability of quasi-static
speckles. Data were obtained in a thermally actively controlled environment
reproducing realistic conditions encountered at the telescope. The temporal
evolution of the quasi-static wavefront error exhibits linear power law, which
can be used to model quasi-static speckle evolution in the context of
forthcoming high-contrast imaging instruments, with implications for
instrumentation (design, observing strategies, data reduction). Such a model
can be used for instance to derive the timescale on which non-common path

pumped to values $>$ 0.1 within the timescales for which the disc is in the
self-gravitating regime. The high resulting velocity dispersion and the lack of
planetesimal concentration in the spiral arms means that the collision
timescale is very long and that the effect of those collisions that do occur is
destructive rather than leading to further planetesimal growth. We also use the
SPH simulations to calibrate Monte Carlo dynamical experiments: these can be
used to evolve the system over long timescales and can be compared with
analytical solutions of the diffusion equation in particle angular momentum
space. We find that if planetesimals are only formed in a belt at large radius

the majority of planetesimals remain at large radii. If planetesimals indeed
form at early evolutionary stages, when the disc is strongly self-gravitating,

governed by a set of coupled Gross-Pitaevskii-like (GP-like) equations, which
differ from the usual GP equations in the existence of an interference term due
to spin-exchange coupling between the two species. Using these GP-like
equations, we calculate such ground state properties as chemical potentials,
density profiles and spin density profiles, which are directly observable in
experiments. We compare the cases with and without spin exchange. It is
demonstrated that the spin exchange between the two species lowers the chemical
potentials, tends to equalize the wave functions of the two pseudospin
components of each species, and thus homogenizes the spin density. The novel
features of the density and spin density profiles can serve as experimental
probes of this novel Bose system.

Exclusion Principle for electrons leading to forbidden X-ray transitions in
copper atoms. VIP is aiming at a test of the Pauli Exclusion Principle for
electrons with high accuracy, down to the level of 10$^{-29}$ - 10$^{-30}$,
thus improving the previous limit by 3-4 orders of magnitude. The experimental

transition related to the ordering of iron rich clusters. At lower temperatures
(just below RT) two distinct thermally activated mechanisms are superimposed,

with randomly located impurities on shot noise in mesoscopic cavities. We show
that such a disorder becomes dominant in determining the noise behavior when
the amplitude of the potential fluctuations is comparable to the value of the
Fermi energy and for a large enough density of impurities. In contrast to
existing conjectures, random potential fluctuations are shown not to contribute
to achieving the chaotic regime whose signature is a Fano factor of 1/4, but,
rather, to the diffusive behavior typical of disordered conductors. In
particular, the 1/4 suppression factor expected for a symmetric cavity can be
achieved only in high-quality material, with a very low density of impurities.
As the disorder strength is increased, a relatively rapid transition of the
suppression factor from 1/4 to values typical of diffusive or quasi-diffusive
transport is observed. Finally, on the basis of a comparison between a
hard-wall and a realistic model of the cavity, we conclude that the specific
details of the confinement potential have a minor influence on noise.

bimetric theory of massive gravity, galileon modified gravity and DGP models
applied to late time expansion of the universe. We also carry out comparison
between bimetric and DGP models using Statefinder pairs {r, s} and {r, q}. We
show that statefinder diagnostic can differentiate between {\Lambda}CDM and
above mentioned cosmological models of dark energy, and finally show that
Statefinder S2 is an excellent discriminant of {\Lambda}CDM and modified
gravity models.

orbits by deriving the corresponding time rates of change of its orbital
elements. This is achieved by expanding the non singular potential into power
series up to second order. This series contains three terms, the first being
the Newtonian potential and the other two, (first order term)and (second order
term), express deviations of the singular potential from the Newtonian. These
deviations from the Newtonian potential are taken as disturbing potential terms
in the Lagrange planetary equations that provide the time rates of change of
the orbital elements of a satellite in a non singular gravitational field. We
split these effects into secular, low and high frequency components and we
evaluate them numerically using the low Earth orbiting mission Gravity Recovery
and Climate Experiment (GRACE). We show that the secular effect of the second
order disturbing term on the perigee and the mean anomaly are, 4.307 10^-9/a
and -2.533 10^-15/a respectively. These effects, are far too small and most
likely cannot easily be observed with todays technology. Numerical evaluation
of the low and high frequency effects of the disturbing term on low Earth
orbiters like GRACE are very small and undetectable by current observational
means.

information change and retrieval. As it becomes easier to publish documents, as
the number of users, and thus publishers, increases and as the number of
documents grows, searching for information is turning into a cumbersome and
time-consuming operation. Because of the loose interconnection between
documents, people have difficulty remembering where they have been and
returning to previously visited pages. Navigation through the web faces
problems of locating oneself with respect to space and time. The idea of
graphical assistance navigation is to help users to find their paths in
hyperspace by adapting the style of link presentation to the goals, knowledge
and other characteristics of an individual user. We first introduce the
concepts related to web navigation; we then present an overview of different
graphical navigation tools and techniques. We conclude by presenting a
comparative table of these tools based on some pertinent criteria.

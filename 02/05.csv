contact ballistic Josephson junctions is demonstrated. An etched InAs-based
heterostructure is laterally contacted to superconducting niobium leads and the
existence of two etched side gates permits, in combination with the application
of a perpendicular magnetic field, to modify continuously the magnetic
interference pattern by depleting the weak link. For wider junctions the
supercurrent presents a Fraunhofer-like interference pattern with periodicity
h/2e whereas by shrinking electrostatically the weak link, the periodicity
evolves continuously to a monotonic decay. These devices represent novel
tunable structures that might lead to the study of the elusive Majorana
fermions.

dark energy, but also cannot prevent, in principle, the determination of its

averaged observable and on the regime considered for the power spectrum.
However, taking into account the appropriate corrections arising in the

the 10% level which, for limited statistics, will necessarily limit the
attainable precision. The predicted dispersion appears to be in good agreement

freely among a finite set of modes, and whose dynamics is specified by a finite
number of real-valued variables with mode-dependent rates that can vary within
given bounded sets. The schedulability problem for BMMS is defined as an
infinite-round game between two players---the scheduler and the
environment---where in each round the scheduler proposes a time and a mode
while the environment chooses an allowable rate for that mode, and the state of
the system changes linearly in the direction of the rate vector. The goal of
the scheduler is to keep the state of the system within a pre-specified safe
set using a non-Zeno schedule, while the goal of the environment is the
opposite. Green scheduling under uncertainty is a paradigmatic example of BMMS
where a winning strategy of the scheduler corresponds to a robust
energy-optimal policy. We present an algorithm to decide whether the scheduler
has a winning strategy from an arbitrary starting state, and give an algorithm
to compute such a winning strategy, if it exists. We show that the
schedulability problem for BMMS is co-NP complete in general, but for two
variables it is in PTIME. We also study the discrete schedulability problem
where the environment has only finitely many choices of rate vectors in each

confirm the robustness of our previous conclusions [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109,

that a relay with multiple antennas or multiple relays employing a single

between the quantum states and the positions of the oscillators. Quantum
coherence, expectation values, and measurement probabilities for system
observables can therefore be realized from the corresponding classical states.
The time evolution of an N-level system is represented as the rotation of a
real state vector in hyperspace, as previously known for density matrix states

then mapped directly to n oscillators in one physical dimension. The number of

Although the well-known equivalence (SU(2), SO(3) homomorphism) of 2-level
quantum dynamics to a rotation in real, physical space cannot be generalized to
arbitrary N-level systems, representing quantum dynamics by a system of coupled
harmonic oscillators in one physical dimension is general for any N. Values for

observations with the ESO Very Large Telescope to search for optical
counterparts of the pulsar and its nebula and to explore their multi-wavelength
emission properties. The data were obtained in V and R bands and compared with
archival data in other spectral domains. We do not detect the pulsar in the

for its brightness. Using a red-clump star method, we estimate an interstellar
extinction towards the pulsar of 2 mag, which is consistent with the absorbing
column density derived form X-rays. The respective distance agrees with the
dispersion measure distance. We reanalyse the Chandra X-ray data and compare
the dereddened upper limits with the unabsorbed X-ray spectrum of the pulsar.
We find that regarding its optical-X-ray spectral properties this gamma-ray
pulsar is not distinct from other pulsars detected in both ranges. However,
like the Vela pulsar, it is very inefficient in the optical and X-rays. Among a
dozen optical sources overlapping with the pulsar X-ray nebula we find one with
V = 26.9 and R = 26.3 mag, whose colour is slightly bluer then that of the
field stars and consistent with the peculiar colours typical for pulsar nebula
features. It positionally coincides with a relatively bright feature of the
pulsar X-ray nebula, resembling the Crab wisp and locating in 2 arcsec from the
pulsar. We suggest this source as a counterpart candidate to the feature. Based
on the substantial interstellar extinction towards the pulsar and its optical
inefficiency, further optical studies should be carried out at longer

challenges in modern quantum physics. Such interactions are responsible for a
plethora of fascinating quantum phenomena such as topological quantum liquids

developments of nanoplasmonics with the progress in realizing laser-induced
gauge fields. Nanoplasmonics allows for strong confinement leading to a
geometric resonance in the atom-atom scattering. In combination with the
laser-coupling of the atomic states, this is shown to result in the desired
interaction. We illustrate how this scheme can be used for the stabilization of
strongly correlated fractional quantum Hall states in ultracold fermionic

Then, there is a polynomial function P:Rn -> R which has local minima on the

of P, this implies that there is a polynomial vector field with asymptotically
stable equilibria on X and no other equilibria. Some trajectories of this

Using ISAAC on the ESO VLT UT1 (Antu) we have made high spatial resolution 3.3
{\mu}m imaging observations of the central kiloparsec of CenA. These
observations have been compared with star formation tracers in the near- and
mid-infrared, as well as with mid-infrared tracers of nuclear activity.
Results. The nucleus is not devoid of PAH emission, implying that the PAH
particles are not destroyed in the nucleus as might be expected for such a
harsh environment. However, we see the feature to continuum ratio decrease
towards the AGN. As well, the 3.3 {\mu}m PAH feature emission generally traces
the sites of star formation in Cen A, but in detail there are spatial offsets,
consistent with an earlier study of the starburst galaxies NGC 253 and NGC
1808. However, the feature-to-continuum ratio does not drop at the positions of
star formation as was previously seen in that earlier study. The cause for this
difference remains uncertain. Finally, our data reveal possible evidence for a
nearly face-on, circular or spiral, dust structure surrounding the nucleus.

trace an extreme form of star-formation. We present a K-band study of SSC
candidates in a sample of local luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) using two
adaptive optics instruments (VLT/NACO and Gemini/ALTAIR/NIRI). In addition to
facilitating SSC detections in obscured environments, this work introduces SSC
studies in hosts with higher star-formation rates (SFRs) than most previous
studies. We find that the luminosity functions (LFs) of the clusters are
reasonably well-fitted by a single power-law with the values of the index
\alpha ranging between 1.5 to 2.4 with an average value of \alpha ~ 1.9. This
value appears to be less steep than the average \alpha ~ 2.2 in normal spiral
galaxies. Due to the host galaxy distances involved (median $D_L$ ~ 70 Mpc)
blending effects have to be taken into account, and are investigated using
Monte Carlo simulations of blending effects for LFs and a photometric SSC
analysis of the well-studied Antennae system which is artificially redshifted
to distances of our sample. While blending tends to flatten LFs our analyses
show that \Delta \alpha is less than ~ 0.1 in our sample. The simulations also
show that in the luminosity range, $M_K < -13$, considered in this work the
extracted SSC luminosities are generally dominated by a single dominant star
cluster rather than several knots of SF. We present resolution- and
distance-dependent SSC surface density confusion limits and show how blending
rates and aperture sizes affect the LFs. The smallest possible apertures should
be used in crowded regions.

defining two different parimagnetic configurations, which is a fully unexpected

enhanced effective moment due to the presence of short range magnetic

split ring resonators (ABC-SRRs) as a function of the relative in-plane
displacement between the two component SRRs. The asymmetry is defined as the
difference in the capacitive gap widths (\Delta g) between the two resonators
comprising a coupled unit. We characterize the response of ABC-SRRs both
numerically and experimentally via terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. As with
symmetric BC-SRRs (\Delta g=0 \mu m), a large redshift in the LC resonance is
observed with increasing displacement, resulting from changes in the capacitive
and inductive coupling. However, for ABC-SRRs, in-plane shifting between the
two resonators by more than 0.375Lo (Lo=SRR sidelength) results in a transition
to a response with two resonant modes, associated with decoupling in the
ABC-SRRs. For increasing \Delta g, the decoupling transition begins at the same
relative shift (0.375Lo), though with an increase in the oscillator strength of
the new mode. This strongly contrasts with symmetric BC-SRRs which present only
one resonance for shifts up to 0.75Lo. Since all BC-SRRs are effectively
asymmetric when placed on a substrate, an understanding of ABC-SRR behavior is
essential for a complete understanding of BC-SRR based metamaterials.

polyhedral grain shapes with a_eff = 0.1 {\mu}m. The shape characteristics
identified are: 1) elongation/reduction along one of three crystallographic
axes; 2) asymmetry, such that all three crystallographic axes are of different
lengths; and 3) the presence of crystalline faces that are not parallel to a
specific crystallographic axis, e.g., non-rectangular prisms and (di)pyramids.
Elongation/reduction dominates the locations and shapes of spectral features
near 10, 11, 16, 23.5, 27, and 33.5 {\mu}m, while asymmetry and tips are
secondary shape effects. Increasing grain sizes (0.1-1.0 {\mu}m) shifts the 10,
11 {\mu}m features systematically towards longer wavelengths and relative to
the 11 {\mu}m feature increases the strengths and slightly broadens the longer
wavelength features. Seven spectral shape classes are established for
crystallographic a-, b-, and c-axes and include columnar and platelet shapes
plus non-elongated or equant grain shapes. The spectral shape classes and the
effects of grain size have practical application in identifying or excluding
columnar, platelet or equant forsterite grain shapes in astrophysical environs.

  Performance Evaluation 2014",,,,"cs.NI cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most discovery systems for silent failures work in two phases: a continuous
monitoring phase that detects presence of failures through probe packets and a
localization phase that pinpoints the faulty element(s). This separation is
important because localization requires significantly more resources than
detection and should be initiated only when a fault is present.
  We focus on improving the efficiency of the detection phase, where the goal
is to balance the overhead with the cost associated with longer failure
detection times. We formulate a general model which unifies the treatment of
probe scheduling mechanisms, stochastic or deterministic, and different cost
objectives - minimizing average detection time (SUM) or worst-case detection
time (MAX).
  We then focus on two classes of schedules. {\em Memoryless schedules} -- a
subclass of stochastic schedules which is simple and suitable for distributed
deployment. We show that the optimal memorlyess schedulers can be efficiently
computed by convex programs (for SUM objectives) or linear programs (for MAX
objectives), and surprisingly perhaps, are guaranteed to have expected
detection times that are not too far off the (NP hard) stochastic optima. {\em
Deterministic schedules} allow us to bound the maximum (rather than expected)
cost of undetected faults, but like stochastic schedules, are NP hard to
optimize. We develop novel efficient deterministic schedulers with provable
approximation ratios.
  An extensive simulation study on real networks, demonstrates significant
performance gains of our memoryless and deterministic schedulers over previous
approaches. Our unified treatment also facilitates a clear comparison between
different objectives and scheduling mechanisms.

physical systems in which both the explicit diffusion of molecules and noise in
the chemical reaction process play important roles. The Smoluchowski
diffusion-limited reaction model (SDLR) is one of several that have been used
to study biological systems. Exact realizations of the underlying stochastic
process described by the SDLR model can be generated by the recently proposed
First-Passage Kinetic Monte Carlo (FPKMC) method. This exactness relies on
sampling analytical solutions to one and two-body diffusion equations in
simplified protective domains.
  In this work we extend the FPKMC to allow for drift arising from fixed,
background potentials. As the corresponding Fokker-Planck equations that
describe the motion of each molecule can no longer be solved analytically, we
develop a hybrid method that discretizes the protective domains. The
discretization is chosen so that the drift-diffusion of each molecule within
its protective domain is approximated by a continuous-time random walk on a
lattice. New lattices are defined dynamically as the protective domains are
updated, hence we will refer to our method as Dynamic Lattice FPKMC or
DL-FPKMC. We focus primarily on the one-dimensional case in this manuscript,
and demonstrate the numerical convergence and accuracy of our method in this
case for both smooth and discontinuous potentials. We also present applications
of our method, which illustrate the impact of drift on reaction kinetics.

weighted average of the fractional rate of change of the edges, lambda in L*,
of the circumcentric dual lattice, S*, that are in the dual of L. The inherent

higher spin black holes in SL(N,R)\times SL(N,R) Chern-Simons theory with
generalized asymptotically-anti-de Sitter boundary conditions. From a
holographic perspective, these bulk theories are dual to two-dimensional CFTs
with W_N symmetry algebras, and the black hole solutions are dual to thermal
states with higher spin chemical potentials and charges turned on. Because the
notion of horizon area is not gauge-invariant in the higher spin theory, the
traditional approaches to the computation of black hole entropy must be
reconsidered. One possibility, explored in the recent literature, involves
demanding the existence of a partition function in the CFT, and consistency
with the first law of thermodynamics. This approach is not free from
ambiguities, however, and in particular different definitions of energy result
in different expressions for the entropy. In the present work we show that
there are natural definitions of the thermodynamically conjugate variables that
follow from careful examination of the variational principle, and moreover
agree with those obtained via canonical methods. Building on this intuition, we
derive general expressions for the higher spin black hole entropy and free
energy which are written entirely in terms of the Chern-Simons connections, and
are valid for both static and rotating solutions. We compare our results to
other proposals in the literature, and provide a new and efficient way to
determine the generalization of the Cardy formula to a situation with higher
spin charges.

them using three complementary approaches: the computation of distances based
on the subsampling of diversity, assessing the separability of individual genes
for a specific cell line both within and between cell types, and a hierarchical
soft classification technique that will assign a membership value for specific
genes in specific cell types given a number of different criteria. These
approaches will allow us to assess the observed gene-expression diversity in
these datasets, as well as assess how well a priori cell types characterize
their constituent populations. In conclusion, the application of these findings

Chandra data with Spitzer IRAC/MIPS and VLA data within the GOODS-N/S and
COSMOS fields, we find evidence for AGN activity in ~14 percent of 271 AzTEC
SMGs, ~28 percent considering only the two GOODS fields. Through X-ray spectral
modeling and SED fitting using Monte Carlo Markov Chain techniques to
Siebenmorgen et al. (2004) (AGN) and Efstathiou et al. (2000) (starburst)
templates, we find that while star formation dominates the IR emission, with
SFRs ~100-1000 M_sun/yr, the X-ray emission for most sources is almost
exclusively from obscured AGNs, with column densities in excess of 10^23 cm^-2.
Only for ~6 percent of our sources do we find an X-ray-derived SFR consistent
with NIR-to-radio SED derived SFRs. Inclusion of the X-ray luminosities as a
prior to the NIR-to-radio SED effectively sets the AGN luminosity and SFR,
preventing significant contribution from the AGN template. Our SED modeling
further shows that the AGN and starburst templates typically lack the required
1.1 mm emission necessary to match observations, arguing for an extended, cool
dust component. The cross correlation function between the full samples of
X-ray sources and SMGs in these fields does not indicate a strong correlation
between the two populations at large scales, suggesting that SMGs and AGNs do
not necessarily trace the same underlying large scale structure. Combined with
the remaining X-ray-dim SMGs, this suggests that sub-mm bright sources may
evolve along multiple tracks, with X-ray-detected SMGs representing
transitionary objects between periods of high star formation and AGN activity
while X-ray-faint SMGs represent a brief starburst phase of more normal
galaxies.

initial abundances of these short-lived radionuclides in the solar

alternatively, the solar protoplanetary disk, thereby requiring a special
scenario for the formation of our Solar System. Here, we use supercomputers to
model---from first principles---the production, transport and admixing of

molecular clouds. The $^{60}$Fe/$^{26}$Al yield ratio of $\approx 0.2$
calculated from our simulations is consistent with the galactic value of 0.15
$\pm$ 0.06 inferred from $\gamma$--ray astronomy but is significantly higher

gas and dust emission of high-redshift galaxies (z>5). However, at these
redshifts the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature is higher,
approaching, and even exceeding, the temperature of cold dust and molecular gas
observed in the local Universe. In this paper, we discuss the impact of the
warmer CMB on (sub-)millimeter observations of high-redshift galaxies. The CMB
affects the observed (sub-)millimeter dust continuum and the line emission
(e.g. carbon monoxide, CO) in two ways: (i) it provides an additional source of
(both dust and gas) heating; and (ii) it is a non-negligible background against
which the line and continuum emission are measured. We show that these two
competing processes affect the way we interpret the dust and gas properties of
high-redshift galaxies using spectral energy distribution models. We quantify
these effects and provide correction factors to compute what fraction of the
intrinsic dust (and line) emission can be detected against the CMB as a
function of frequency, redshift and temperature. We discuss implications on the
derived properties of high-redshift galaxies from (sub-)millimeter data.
Specifically, the inferred dust and molecular gas masses can be severely
underestimated for cold systems if the impact of the CMB is not properly taken
into account.

the current correlators. We generalize our recent study of the QNMs of the a.c.
charge conductivity to include momentum dependence. This sheds light on the
various excitations in the CFT. We begin by discussing the R-current
correlators of the N=8 SU(N) super-Yang-Mills theory at its conformal fixed
point using holography. For instance, transitions in the QNM spectrum as a
function of momentum clearly identify hydrodynamic-to-relativistic crossovers.
We then extend our study to include four-derivative terms in the gravitational
description allowing us to study more generic charge response as well as the
role of S-duality, which plays a central role in understanding the correlators.
The presence of dispersing Drude-like QNMs can lead to new behavior, distinct
from what occurs in the aforementioned gauge theory. We also extend previous
conductivity sum rules to finite momentum and discuss their interpretation in
the gravity picture. A comparison is finally made with the conformal fixed
point of the vector O(N) model in the large-N limit.

that while CHI is generically quasi-telelogical in time-dependent backgrounds,

chiral (ABC) multilayer graphene placed on a boron nitride (BN) substrate. The
degree of flatness can be tuned by varying the number of graphene layers N. For
N = 7 the bands become nearly flat, with a small bandwidth of 3.6 meV. The two
nearly flat bands coming from the K and K' valleys cross along lines in the
reduced zone. Weak intervalley tunneling turns the bandcrossing into an avoided
crossing, producing two nearly flat bands with global Chern number zero, but
with local Berry curvature. The flatness of the bands suggests that many body
effects will dominate the physics, while the local Berry curvature of the bands
endows the system with a nontrivial quantum geometry. The quantum geometry
effects manifest themselves through the quantum distance (Fubini-Study) metric,
rather than the more conventional Chern number. Multilayer graphene on BN thus
provides a platform for investigating the effect of interactions in a system
with a non-trivial quantum distance metric, without the complication of
non-zero Chern numbers. We note in passing that flat bands with non-zero Chern
number can also be realized by making use of magnetic adatoms, and explicitly

estimation procedures. This estimator is straightforward to apply to
observations, it robustly finds the likelihood maximum, and it conveniently
selects angular scales at which fluctuations are well approximated as
independent between redshift bins and at which linear theory applies. We find
that the linear bias times number of objects in a redshift bin generally can be
constrained with cross-correlations to fractional error (10^2 n/N)^1/2, where N
is the total number of spectra per dz and n is the number of redshift bins
spanned by the bulk of the unknown population. The error is often independent
of the sky area and sampling fraction. Furthermore, we find that sub-percent

principle possible, although cosmic magnification needs to be accounted for at
fractional errors of <~ 10 per cent. We discuss how the sensitivity to dN/dz

optimize the survey strategy to constrain dN/dz. We also quantify how well

more strikingly because he measured the parallaxes of many stars at Cambridge,
and could plot absolute magnitude against spectral type for many points. The
general concept of dwarf and giant stars was essential in the galactic
structure work of Harlow Shapley, Russell's first graduate student. In order to
calibrate the period-luminosity relation of Cepheid variables, he was obliged
to fall back on statistical parallax using only 11 Cepheids, a very sparse
sample. Here the insight provided by the Russell diagram became critical. The
presence of yellow K giant stars in globular clusters credentialed his
calibration of the period-luminosity relation by showing that the calibrated
luminosity of the Cepheids was comparable to the luminosity of the K giants. It
is well known that in 1920 Shapley did not believe in the cosmological
distances of Heber Curtis' spiral nebulae. It is not so well known that in 1920
Curtis' plot of the period-luminosity relation suggests that he didn't believe

in the Einstein frame and correct identifications of mass parameters. Allowing
for a non-renormalizable K\""ahler potential in the hidden sector, the
decoupling limit of a superheavy sgoldstino is identified with an infinite
negative K\""ahler curvature. Constraints that lead to non-linear realizations
of supersymmetry emerge as consequence of the equations of motion of the
goldstino superfield when considering the decoupling limit. Finally, by
employing superspace Bianchi identities, we identify the real chiral

the detection of a magnetic field in three planet-hosting solar-like stars

compared the position of the stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram to
evolutionary tracks, to estimate their mass and age. We used the lithium
abundance, derived from the Stokes I spectra, to further constrain the ages. We
obtained a definite magnetic field detection for both HD 70642 and HD 154088,

between scale invariance and conformal invariance in relativistic quantum field
theories. Under some technical assumptions, we can prove that scale invariant
quantum field theories in $d=2$ dimension necessarily possess the enhanced
conformal symmetry. The use of the conformal symmetry is well appreciated in
the literature, but the fact that all the scale invariant phenomena in $d=2$
dimension enjoy the conformal property relies on the deep structure of the
renormalization group. The outstanding question is whether this feature is
specific to $d=2$ dimension or it holds in higher dimensions, too. As of
January 2014, our consensus is that there is no known example of scale
invariant but non-conformal field theories in $d=4$ dimension under the
assumptions of (1) unitarity, (2) Poincar\'e invariance (causality), (3)
discrete spectrum in scaling dimension, (4) existence of scale current and (5)
unbroken scale invariance in the vacuum. We have a perturbative proof of the
enhancement of conformal invariance from scale invariance based on the higher
dimensional analogue of Zamolodchikov's $c$-theorem, but the non-perturbative
proof is yet to come. As a reference we have tried to collect as many
interesting examples of scale invariance in relativistic quantum field theories
as possible in this article. We give a complementary holographic argument based
on the energy-condition of the gravitational system and the space-time
diffeomorphism in order to support the claim of the symmetry enhancement. We
believe that the possible enhancement of conformal invariance from scale
invariance reveals the sublime nature of the renormalization group and
space-time with holography.

from the differences between consecutive images taken by surveillance cameras.
This paper focuses on the problem of recovering a K-sparse signal x in N
dimensions. In the mainstream framework of compressed sensing (CS), the vector
x is recovered from M non-adaptive linear measurements y = xS, where S (of size
N x M) is typically a Gaussian (or Gaussian-like) design matrix, through some
optimization procedure such as linear programming (LP).
  In our proposed method, the design matrix S is generated from an
$\alpha$-stable distribution with $\alpha\approx 0$. Our decoding algorithm
mainly requires one linear scan of the coordinates, followed by a few
iterations on a small number of coordinates which are ""undetermined"" in the
previous iteration. Comparisons with two strong baselines, linear programming
(LP) and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), demonstrate that our algorithm can
be significantly faster in decoding speed and more accurate in recovery
quality, for the task of exact spare recovery. Our procedure is robust against
measurement noise. Even when there are no sufficient measurements, our
algorithm can still reliably recover a significant portion of the nonzero
coordinates.
  To provide the intuition for understanding our method, we also analyze the
procedure by assuming an idealistic setting. Interestingly, when K=2, the
""idealized"" algorithm achieves exact recovery with merely 3 measurements,
regardless of N. For general K, the required sample size of the ""idealized""
algorithm is about 5K.

representations of Lie groups and probability theory. It subdivides into
essentially three parts.
  In a first rather algebraic part, we construct a path model for geometric
crystals in the sense of Berenstein and Kazhdan, for complex semi-simple Lie
groups. We will mainly describe the algebraic structure, its natural morphisms
and parameterizations. The theory of total positivity will play a particularly
important role.
  Then, we anticipate on the probabilistic part by exhibiting a canonical
measure on geometric crystals. It uses as ingredients the superpotential for
the flag manifold and a measure invariant under the crystal actions. The image
measure under the weight map plays the role of Duistermaat-Heckman measure. Its
Laplace transform defines Whittaker functions, providing an interesting formula
for all Lie groups. Then it appears clearly that Whittaker functions are to
geometric crystals, what characters are to combinatorial crystals. The
Littlewood-Richardson rule is also exposed.
  Finally we present the probabilistic approach that allows to find the
canonical measure. It is based on the fundamental idea that the Wiener measure
will induce the adequate measure on the algebraic structures through the path
model.
  In the last chapter, we show how our geometric model degenerates to the
continuous classical Littelmann path model and thus recover known results. For
example, the canonical measure on a geometric crystal of highest weight
degenerates into a uniform measure on a polytope, and recovers the
parameterizations of continuous crystals.

Wilson renormalization group flow. However the kinematic viscosity receives
correction from the third order Lovelock term. We show that the equivalence

spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking (SChSB) in QCD is encoded in local chiral
properties of Dirac eigenmodes. Such association is possible when viewing
chirality as a dynamical effect, measured with respect to the benchmark of
statistically independent left-right components. Following this rationale leads
to describing local chiral behavior by a taylor-made correlation, namely the
recently introduced correlation coefficient of polarization C_A. In this
language, correlated modes (C_A>0) show dynamical preference for local
chirality while anti-correlated modes (C_A<0) favor anti-chirality. Our
conclusion is that SChSB in QCD can be viewed as dominance of low-energy
correlation (chirality) over anti-correlation (anti-chirality) of Dirac sea.
The spectral range of local chirality, chiral polarization scale Lambda_ch, is
a dynamically generated scale in the theory associated with SChSB. One
implication of these findings is briefly discussed.

magnitudes of the available SLSN-I are narrowly distributed ($M = -21.7 \pm
0.4$) in our unfiltered band pass and may suggest an even tighter intrinsic
distribution when the effects of dust are considered, although the sample may
be skewed by selection and publication biases. The presence of OII features
near maximum light may uniquely signal a high luminosity event, and we suggest
further observational and theoretical work is warranted to assess the possible
utility of such SN 2005ap-like SLSN-I as distance indicators. Using the
pseudo-absolute magnitude distributions derived from the light curve sample, we
measure the SLSN-I rate to be about (32^{+77}_{-26}) events Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}

theorem for the certificate-based notion of complexity. Roughly, we show that
Minesweeper evaluates $\beta$-acyclic queries in time linear in the certificate
plus the output size, while for any $\beta$-cyclic query there is some instance
that takes superlinear time in the certificate (and for which the output is no
larger than the certificate size). We also extend our certificate-complexity

  Lakeside, Malaysia (to be published)",,,,"quant-ph hep-th math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hidden-variables models are critically reassessed. It is first examined if
the quantum discord is classically described by the hidden-variable model of
Bell in the Hilbert space with $d=2$. The criterion of vanishing quantum
discord is related to the notion of reduction and, surprisingly, the
hidden-variable model in $d=2$, which has been believed to be consistent so
far, is in fact inconsistent and excluded by the analysis of conditional
measurement and reduction. The description of the full contents of quantum
discord by the deterministic hidden-variables models is not possible. We also
re-examine CHSH inequality. It is shown that the well-known prediction of CHSH
inequality $|B|\leq 2$ for the CHSH operator $B$ introduced by Cirel'son is not
unique. This non-uniqueness arises from the failure of linearity condition in
the non-contextual hidden-variables model in $d=4$ used by Bell and CHSH, in
agreement with Gleason's theorem which excludes $d=4$ non-contextual
hidden-variables models. If one imposes the linearity condition, their model is
converted to a factored product of two $d=2$ models which describes quantum
mechanical separable states. The CHSH inequality thus does not test the
hidden-variables model in $d=4$. This observation is consistent with an
application of the CHSH inequality to quantum cryptography by Ekert, which is
based on mixed separable states without referring to dispersion-free
representations. As for hidden-variables models, there exist no viable local
non-contextual models in any dimensions.

layer on their surface. In oscillatory rheological tests, this skin is found to
introduce a yield stress that typically dominates the elastic response but can
be tuned by exposing the metal to hydrochloric acid solutions of different
concentration. We systematically studied the normal impact of eutectic
gallium-indium (eGaIn) drops under different oxidation conditions and show how
this leads to two different dynamical regimes. At low impact velocity (or low
Weber number), eGaIn droplets display strong recoil and rebound from the
impacted surface when the oxide layer is removed. In addition, the degree of
drop deformation or spreading during the impact is controlled by the oxide
skin. We show that the scaling law known from ordinary liquids for the maximum
spreading radius as a function of impact velocity can still be applied to the
case of oxidized eGaIn if an effective Weber number $We^{\star}$ is employed
that uses an effective surface tension factoring in the yield stress. In
contrast, no influence on spreading from different oxidations conditions is
observed for high impact velocity. This suggests that the initial kinetic
energy is mostly damped by bulk viscous dissipation. Results from both regimes
can be collapsed in an impact phase diagram controlled by two variables, the
maximum spreading factor $P_m = R_0/R_m$, given by the ratio of initial to
maximum drop radius, and the impact number $K = We^{\star}/Re^{4/5}$, which
scales with the effective Weber number $We^{\star}$ as well as the Reynolds

in financial econometrics and risk management. The risk is often estimated by a
substitution of a good estimator of the volatility matrix. However, the
accuracy of such a risk estimator for large portfolios is largely unknown, and
a simple inequality in the previous literature gives an infeasible upper bound
for the estimation error. In addition, numerical studies illustrate that this
upper bound is very crude. In this paper, we propose factor-based risk
estimators under a large amount of assets, and introduce a high-confidence
level upper bound (H-CLUB) to assess the accuracy of the risk estimation. The
H-CLUB is constructed based on three different estimates of the volatility
matrix: sample covariance, approximate factor model with known factors, and
unknown factors (POET, Fan, Liao and Mincheva, 2013). For the first time in the

bounds significantly outperform the traditional crude bounds, and provide
insightful assessment of the estimation of the portfolio risks. In addition,
our simulated results quantify the relative error in the risk estimation, which
is usually negligible using 3-month daily data. Finally, the proposed methods

subdwarf stars, which are thought as a possible origin of UV-upturn of old
stellar populations, are found in binaries. Previous works showed that binary
evolution can make the spectra of binary star populations significantly
different from those of single star populations. However, the effect of binary
evolution has not been taken into account in most works of spectral fitting of
galaxies. This paper studies the role of binary evolution in spectral fitting
of early-type galaxies, via a stellar population synthesis model including both
single and binary star populations. Spectra from ultraviolet to optical band
are fitted to determine a few parameters of galaxies. The results show that the
inclusion of binaries in stellar population models may lead to obvious change
in the determination of some galaxy parameters and therefore it is potentially
important for spectral studies. In particular, the ages of young components of
composite stellar populations become much older when using binary star
population models instead of single star population models. This implies that
binary star population models will measure significantly different star
formation histories (SFHs) for galaxies compared to single star population
models. In addition, stellar population models with binary interactions measure
larger dust extinctions than single star population models on average. It
suggests that when using binary star population models instead of single star
population models, negative extinctions are possibly unnecessary in spectral
fitting of early-type galaxies.

result in appreciable production of 48Ca in such neutron-rich and low-entropy

consider possible uncertainties in the entropies or ejecta-mass distribution.
ECSNe could thus be a site of 48Ca production in addition to a hypothetical,
rare class of high-density Type Ia supernovae.

forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs). The recursive cost
functionals are defined by controlled fully coupled FBSDEs. We study two cases
of diffusion coefficients $\sigma$ of FSDEs. We use a new method to prove that
the value functions are deterministic, satisfy the dynamic programming
principle (DPP), and are viscosity solutions to the associated generalized
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. The associated generalized HJB
equations are related with algebraic equations when $\sigma$ depends on the
second component of the solution $(Y, Z)$ of the BSDE and doesn't depend on the
control. For this we adopt Peng's BSDE method, and so in particular, the notion
of stochastic backward semigroup in [16]. We emphasize that the fact that
$\sigma$ also depends on $Z$ makes the stochastic control much more complicate
and has as consequence that the associated HJB equation is combined with an
algebraic equation, which is inspired by Wu and Yu [19]. We use the
continuation method combined with the fixed point theorem to prove that the
algebraic equation has a unique solution, and moreover, we also give the
representation for this solution. On the other hand, we prove some new basic
estimates for fully coupled FBSDEs under the monotonic assumptions. In
particular, we prove under the Lipschitz and linear growth conditions that
fully coupled FBSDEs have a unique solution on the small time interval, if the
Lipschitz constant of $\sigma$\ with respect to $z$ is sufficiently small. We
also establish a generalized comparison theorem for such fully coupled FBSDEs.

  manuscript",,,,"math.AP math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Subject to suitable boundary conditions being imposed, sharp inequalities are
obtained on integrals over a region $\Omega$ of certain special quadratic
functions $f(\bf{E})$ where $\bf{E}(\bf{x})$ derives from a potential
$\bf{U}(\bf{x})$. With $\bf{E}=\nabla\bf{U}$ it is known that such sharp
inequalities can be obtained when $f(\bf{E})$ is a quasiconvex function and
when $\bf{U}$ satisfies affine boundary conditions (i.e., for some matrix
$\bf{D}$, $\bf{U}=\bf{D}\bf{x}$ on $\partial\Omega$). Here we allow for other
boundary conditions and for fields $\bf{E}$ that involve derivatives of a
variety orders of $\bf{U}$. We define a notion of convexity that generalizes
quasiconvexity. $Q^*$-convex quadratic functions are introduced, characterized
and an algorithm is given for generating sharply $Q^*$-convex functions. We
emphasize that this also solves the outstanding problem of finding an algorithm
for generating extremal quasiconvex quadratic functions. We also treat
integrals over $\Omega$ of special quadratic functions $g(\bf{J})$ where
$\bf{J}(\bf{x})$ satisfies a differential constraint involving derivatives
with, possibly, a variety of orders. The results generalize an example of Kang
and the author in three spatial dimensions where $\bf{J}(\bf{x})$ is a $3\times
3$ matrix valued field satisfying $\nabla\cdot\bf{J}=0$. In the addendum the
paper is clarified. Notably, much more general boundary conditions are given
under which sharp lower bounds on the integrals of certain quadratic functions
of the fields can be obtained. As a consequence, strict $Q^*$-convexity is
found to be an appropriate condition to ensure uniqueness of the solutions of a
wide class of partial differential equations with constant coefficients, in a
given domain $\Omega$ with appropriate boundary conditions.

agreement with observations is achieved when the surface speed of meridional
circulation is about 12 m/s. For this circulation speed the simulated sunspot
activity shows good synchronization with the polar magnetic fields. Such

contributes processors to the global pool but also jobs to be processed on the

  We consider on-line, non-clairvoyant scheduling of sequential jobs. The
started jobs cannot be stopped, canceled, preempted, or moved to other
processors. We consider identical processors, but most of our results can be
extended to related or unrelated processors.
  We model the fair scheduling problem as a cooperative game and we use the
Shapley value to determine the ideal fair schedule. In contrast to the current
literature, we do not use money to assess the relative utilities of jobs.
Instead, to calculate the contribution of an organization, we determine how the
presence of this organization influences the performance of other
organizations. Our approach can be used with arbitrary utility function (e.g.,
flow time, tardiness, resource utilization), but we argue that the utility
function should be strategy resilient. The organizations should be discouraged
from splitting, merging or delaying their jobs. We present the unique (to
within a multiplicative and additive constants) strategy resilient utility
function.
  We show that the problem of fair scheduling is NP-hard and hard to
approximate. However, for unit-size jobs, we present an FPRAS. Also, we show
that the problem parametrized with the number of organizations is FPT. Although
for the large number of the organizations the problem is computationally hard,
the presented exponential algorithm can be used as a fairness benchmark.

with a rate close to the fundamental limits, where the only restriction is that
the channel input alphabet and the reproduction alphabet of the lossy source
code are finite. Random numbers, which satisfy a condition specified by a
function and its value, are used to construct stochastic encoders. The proof of
the theorems is based on the hash property of an ensemble of functions, where
the results are extended to general channels/sources and alternative formulas
are introduced for channel capacity and the rate-distortion region. Since an
ensemble of sparse matrices has a hash property, we can construct a code by
using sparse matrices, where the sum-product algorithm can be used for encoding
and decoding by assuming that channels/sources are memoryless.

vector or tensor boson is crucial in the determination of their spin and CP
properties. We study jet angular correlations in events with a high mass bottom
quark pair or a top quark pair and two jets at the LHC, whose cross-section is
dominated by the virtual gluon fusion sub-processes when appropriate kinematic
selection cuts (vector-boson fusion cuts) are applied. We evaluate helicity
amplitudes for sub-processes initiated by qq, qg and gg collisions in the limit
where the intermediate gluons are collinear to the initial partons. We first
obtain a general expression for the azimuthal angle correlations among the
dijets and t t-bar or b b-bar, in terms of the gg to t t-bar or b b-bar
helicity amplitudes in the real gluon approximation of the full matrix
elements, and find simple analytic expressions in the two kinematic limits, the
production of a heavy quark pair near the threshold, and in the relativistic
limit where the invariant mass of the heavy quark pair is much larger than the
quark mass. For b b-bar + 2 jets we find strong azimuthal angle correlations
which are distinct from those expected for events with a CP-even or odd scalar
boson which may decay into a b b-bar pair. For t t-bar + 2 jets we find that
the angular correlations are similar to that of a CP-odd scalar+2 jets near the
threshold M_(t t-bar) ~ 2 m_t, while in the relativistic limit they resemble
the distribution for b b-bar + 2 jets. These correlations in the standard QCD
processes will help establish the experimental technique to measure the spin
and CP properties of new particles produced via gluon fusion at the LHC.

possible embeddings $e: \Sigma_g\to S^3$.
  We determine the extendabilities for all periodical maps on $\Sigma_2$. The
results involve various orientation preserving/reversing behalves of the
periodical maps on the pair $(S^3, \Sigma_g)$. To do this we first list all
periodic maps on $\Sigma_2$, and indeed we exhibit each of them as a
composition of primary and explicit symmetries, like rotations, reflections and
antipodal maps, which itself should be an interesting piece.
  A by-product is that for each even $g$, the maximum order periodic map on

find relations between two sets of variables. An important extension in pattern
analysis is to consider more than two sets of variables. This problem can be
expressed as a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP), commonly
referred to Multi-set Canonical Correlation Analysis (MCCA). This is a
non-convex problem and so greedy algorithms converge to local optima without
any guarantees on global optimality. In this paper, we show that despite being
highly structured, finding the optimal solution is NP-Hard. This motivates our
relaxation of the QCQP to a semidefinite program (SDP). The SDP is convex, can
be solved reasonably efficiently and comes with both absolute and
output-sensitive approximation quality. In addition to theoretical guarantees,
we do an extensive comparison of the QCQP method and the SDP relaxation on a
variety of synthetic and real world data. Finally, we present two useful
extensions: we incorporate kernel methods and computing multiple sets of
canonical vectors.

these networks are of great interest as dynamical models of biological and
cognitive processes, it is useful to understand how particular graphs can be
realised as robust heteroclinic networks that are attracting. This paper
presents two methods of realizing arbitrarily complex directed graphs as robust
heteroclinic networks for flows generated by ODEs---we say the ODEs {\em
realise} the graphs as heteroclinic networks between equilibria that represent
the vertices. Suppose we have a directed graph on $n_v$ vertices with $n_e$
edges. The ""simplex realisation"" embeds the graph as an invariant set of a flow
on an $(n_v-1)$-simplex. This method realises the graph as long as it is one-

set of a flow on a $(n_e+1)$-dimensional space. This method realises the graph
as long as it is one-cycle free. In both cases we find the graph as an
invariant set within an attractor, and discuss some illustrative examples,
including the influence of noise and parameters on the dynamics. In particular
we show that the resulting heteroclinic network may or may not display ""memory""

between the atoms and other material particles (collisional transitions). In
applications within the framework of the multiterm model atom (which accounts
for quantum interference between magnetic sublevels pertaining either to the
same J-level or to different J-levels within the same term) collisional
processes are generally neglected when solving the master equation for the
atomic density matrix. This is partly due to the lack of experimental data
and/or of approximate theoretical expressions for calculating the collisional
transfer and relaxation rates (in particular the rates for interference between
sublevels pertaining to different J-levels, and the depolarizing rates due to
elastic collisions). In this paper we formally define and investigate the
transfer and relaxation rates due to isotropic inelastic and superelastic
collisions that enter the statistical equilibrium equations of a multiterm
atom. Under the hypothesis that the atom-collider interaction can be described
by a dipolar operator, we provide expressions that relate the collisional rates

the early gas-rich epoch to terminate growth of galaxies. Here we present
simulations that show that AGN feedback may drive not only gas but also stars
out of their host galaxies under certain conditions. The mechanics of this
process is as following: (1) AGN-driven outflows accelerate and compress gas
filling the host galaxy; (2) the accelerated dense shells become
gravitationally unstable and form stars on radial trajectories. For the
spherically symmetric initial conditions explored here, the black hole needs to
exceed the host's M_sigma mass by a factor of a few to accelerate the shells
and the new stars to escape velocities. We discuss potential implications of
these effects for the host galaxies: (i) radial mixing of bulge stars with the
rest of the host; (ii) contribution of quasar outflows to galactic fountains as
sources of high-velocity clouds; (iii) wholesale ejection of hyper velocity
stars out of their hosts, giving rise to type II supernovae on galactic
outskirts, and contributing to reionization and metal enrichment of the
Universe; (iv) bulge erosion and even complete destruction in extreme cases
resulting in overweight or bulgeless SMBHs.

window is treated as noisy pixel. The estimation of the noisy pixels was
obtained by local averaging. The essential advantage of applying IQR filter is
to preserve edge sharpness better of the original image. A variety of test

to derive values of the in situ electron densities in the denser zones from

galaxy. A classical two phase model is used to derive the filling factors of
the regions. We find that although the mean electron density decreases with the
square root of the radius of the regions, the in situ density is essentially
independent of this radius. Thus the filling factor falls systematically, as
the radius and the luminosity of the regions increases, with a power law of
exponent -2.23 between filling factor and radius. These measurements should
enhance the perspectives for more refined physical models of HII regions.

problem of scheduling mixed-criticality systems upon uniprocessor or
multiprocessor platforms, with the main objective being to respect the
timeliness of the most critical tasks, at the expense of the requirements of
the less critical ones. In particular, the less critical tasks are carelessly
discarded when the computation demand of (some of) the high critical tasks
increases. This might nevertheless result in system failure, as these less
critical tasks could be accessing data, the consistency of which should be
preserved. In this paper, we address this problem and propose a method to
cautiously handle task suspension. Furthermore, it is usually assumed that the
less critical tasks will never be re-enabled once discarded. In this paper, we
also address this concern by proposing an approach to re-enable the less
critical tasks, without jeopardizing the timeliness of the high critical ones.
The suggested approaches apply to systems having two or more criticality
levels.

to include the effects of anisotropy which typically grow during the collapsing
phase. In this paper we investigate the Bianchi I model in $\bar{\mu}'$ scheme
which truly captures the regularization of the Hamiltonian constraint. To
compare with the earlier works and provide a comparison with the $\bar{\mu}'$
scheme, we also investigate the $\bar{\mu}$ scheme although it has many
disadvantages. First we construct the effective dynamics with higher order
holonomy corrections in a massless scalar field, then we extend it to the
inclusion of arbitrary matter. Besides that, we also analyze the behavior of
the anisotropy during the evolution of the universe. We find that in the
$\bar{\mu}'$ scheme, the singularity is never approached and the quantum bounce
is generic as in the isotropic case, regardless of the order of the holonomy
corrections. Some differences in the bouncing phase of the two schemes are also
found out. It is also shown that in the two schemes the behavior of the
anisotropy is not the same before and after the bounce.

accretion disk and the plasma jets, produced due to conservation of angular
momentum, to the highest energies, where they interact with each other and
produce pions, which decay among others in neutrinos. For a known cosmic ray
spectral behavior, the main parameters in the calcula- tion of the neutrino
flux from proton-proton interactions are the target density nH and the ratio of
electrons to protons fe . Using most recent neutrino flux limits from IceCube
point source searches, we set limits on the target densities for 33 FR-I
galaxies. The densities are shown to be smaller than 30 cm^{-3} to 2000
cm^{-3}, depending on the source and when using a fixed electron to proton
ratio of f_{e} = 0.1. This implies that some cosmic ray acceleration sites,
espe- cially those close to the core of the AGN, can already be excluded, or
else that the ratio of electrons to protons deviates significantly from the
commonly used value of 0.1. For Centaurus A (Cen A) and Messier 87 (M 87) we

extreme mass ratio binary black holes. In the adiabatic approximation, valid in
the extreme mass ratio case, if the orbital flux lost due to gravitational
radiation reaction is compensated for by the orbital flux gained from the spins
of the black holes via superradiant scattering (or, equivalently, tidal
acceleration) the orbital decay would be stalled, causing the binary to
""float"". We show that this flux balance is not, in practice, possible for
extreme mass ratio binary black holes with circular equatorial orbits;
furthermore, adding eccentricity and inclination to the orbits will not
significantly change this null result, thus ruling out the possibility of
floating orbits for extreme mass ratio binary black holes. We also argue that
binaries consisting of material bodies dense and massive enough to generate
gravitational waves detectable by any kind of gravitational wave detector are
also unlikely to float. Using a multipolar analysis, we show that a non-Kerr
spacetime which could produce a floating orbit (given the same amount of tidal
acceleration as in the case of a Kerr black hole) would need to be rapidly
rotating prolate spheroid, which would be an exotic object indeed.

a first-order electroweak phase transition which satisfy Sakharov's three
conditions for the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. These
extensions provide a sufficiently strong phase transition and remove the main
obstacles which appear in the context of the Standard Model: A far-too-high
lower bound on the Higgs mass, immediate wipeout of the newly-created baryon
asymmetry, and insufficient CP violation. We describe the Universe
hydrodynamically as a fluid coupled to the Higgs field via a phenomenological
friction term, and study the time evolution of bubbles nucleated during the
phase transition. We express the friction term in the hydrodynamic equations in
terms of the particle content of the model, calibrate the friction on the basis
of existing calculations for the Standard Model, and produce predictions for
the velocity of the expanding bubble wall in the stationary regime. This way we
develop a very efficient approach to compute bubble velocities. As an example,
we apply our formalism to the first-order phase transition of a dimension-6
extension of the Standard Model which, within the present bounds on the Higgs
mass, can reproduce the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe. Depending on
the strength of the phase transition, the wall velocity varies from about 0.3
to approaching the speed of light. Our method can easily be adapted to compute
wall velocities in other interesting extensions of the Standard Model.

strengthening the O I lines, and the difference between the non-LTE and LTE
abundances (non-LTE correction) is negative. The departures from LTE grow
toward higher effective temperature and lower surface gravity. In the entire
temperature range and log g = 4, the non-LTE correction does not exceed 0.05
dex in absolute value for O I lines in the visible spectral range. The non-LTE
corrections are significantly larger for the infrared O I 7771-5 A lines and
reach -1.9 dex in the model atmosphere with Teff = 10000 K and log g = 2. To
differentiate the effects of inelastic collisions with electrons and neutral
hydrogen atoms on the statistical equilibrium (SE) of O I, we derived the
oxygen abundance for the three well studied A-type stars Vega, Sirius, and HD
32115. For each star, non-LTE leads to smaller difference between the infrared

in LTE down to 0.14 dex when ignoring LTE. To remove the difference between the
infrared and visible lines in A-type stars completely, one needs to reduce the
used electron-impact excitation rates by Barklem (2007) by a factor of 4. In
the case of Procyon and the Sun, inelastic collisions with H I affect the SE of
O I, and agreement between the abundances from different lines is achieved when

XMM-Newton and GALEX data are combined with published spectroscopic studies of

dwarfs. We make use of synthetic model spectra to determine the relative
contributions of photospheric and chromospheric emission to the ultraviolet
flux. We also analyse the same diagnostics for a comparison sample of young M
dwarfs in the TWHya association (~10Myrs). We find that generally the emission
in the GALEX bands is dominated by the chromosphere but the photospheric
component is not negligible in early-M field dwarfs. The surface fluxes for the
Halpha, near-ultraviolet, far-ultraviolet and X-ray emission are connected via
a power law dependence. We present here for the first time such flux-flux
relations involving broad-band ultraviolet emission for M dwarfs. For given
spectral type the activity indices, defined as flux ratio between the activity
diagnostic and the bolometric flux of the star, display a spread of 2-3 dex
which is largest for M4 stars. The mean activity index for fast rotators,

the NUV band and Halpha, i.e. the fractional radiation output increases with
atmospheric height. The comparison to the ultraviolet and X-ray properties of
TWHya members shows a drop of nearly three orders of magnitude for the
luminosity in these bands between ~10Myr and few Gyrs age. A few young field
dwarfs (< 1Gyr) in the 10pc sample bridge the gap indicating that the drop in
magnetic activity with age is a continuous process. The slope of the age decay
is steeper for the X-ray than for the UV luminosity.

a photometric redshift. Our analysis allows us to accurately determine the
intrinsic absorption, the broad band continuum shape ({\Gamma}) and intrinsic
L(2-10) distributions, with an accuracy better than 30% on the spectral
parameters for 95% of the sample. The sample is equally divided in type-1
(49.7%) and type-2 AGN (48.7%) plus few passive galaxies at low z. We found a
significant difference in the distribution of {\Gamma} of type-1 and type-2,
with small intrinsic dispersion, a weak correlation of {\Gamma} with L(2-10)
and a large population (15% of the sample) of high luminosity, highly obscured
(QSO2) sources. The distribution of the X ray/Optical flux ratio (Log(FX /Fi))
for type-1 is narrow (0 < X/O < 1), while type-2 are spread up to X/O = 2. The
X/O correlates well with the amount of X-ray obscuration. Finally, a small
sample of Compton thick candidates and peculiar sources is presented. In the
appendix we discuss the comparison between Chandra and XMM-Newton spectra for
280 sources in common. We found a small systematic difference, with XMM-Newton
spectra that tend to have softer power-laws and lower obscuration.

  Method","34 pages, 13 figures",,,,"cond-mat.soft physics.med-ph q-bio.TO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The quantification of the stiffness of tubular biological structures is often
obtained, both in vivo and in vitro, as the slope of total transmural hoop
stress plotted against hoop strain. Total hoop stress is typically estimated
using the ""Laplace law."" We show that this procedure is fundamentally flawed
for two reasons: Firstly, the Laplace law predicts total stress incorrectly for
biological vessels. Furthermore, because muscle and other biological tissue are
closely volume-preserving, quantifications of elastic modulus require the
removal of the contribution to total stress from incompressibility. We show
that this hydrostatic contribution to total stress has a strong
material-dependent nonlinear response to deformation that is difficult to
predict or measure. To address this difficulty, we propose a new practical
method to estimate a mechanically viable modulus of elasticity that can be
applied both in vivo and in vitro using the same measurements as current
methods, with care taken to record the reference state. To be insensitive to
incompressibility, our method is based on shear stress rather than hoop stress,
and provides a true measure of the elastic response without application of the
Laplace law. We demonstrate the accuracy of our method using a mathematical
model of tube inflation with multiple constitutive models. We also re-analyze
an in vivo study from the gastro-intestinal literature that applied the
standard approach and concluded that a drug-induced change in elastic modulus
depended on the protocol used to distend the esophageal lumen. Our new method
removes this protocol-dependent inconsistency in the previous result.

detected is non-sinusoidal and depends on unknown parameters in a non-linear
manner. The attention is paid to the problem of estimating the statistical
significance of candidate periodicities found using such non-linear
periodograms. This problem is related to the task of quantifying the
distributions of maximum values of these periodograms. Based on recent results
in the mathematical theory of extreme values of random field (the generalized
Rice method), we give a general approach to find handy analytic approximation
for these distributions. This approximation has the general form $e^{-z}
P(\sqrt z)$, where $P$ is an algebraic polynomial and $z$ being the periodogram
maximum.
  The general tools developed in this paper can be used in a wide variety of
astronomical applications, for instance in the studies of variable stars and
extrasolar planets. For this goal, we develop and consider in details the
so-called von Mises periodogram: a specialized non-linear periodogram where the
signal is modelled by the von Mises periodic function $\exp(\nu \cos \omega
t)$. This simple function with an additional non-linear parameter $\nu$ can
model lightcurves of many astronomical objects that show periodic photometric
variability of different nature. We prove that our approach can be perfectly
applied to this non-linear periodogram.
  We provide a package of auxiliary C++ programs, attached as the online-only
material. They should faciliate the use of the von Mises periodogram in
practice.

narrow core of the iron Kalpha line and the luminosity of the continuum (i.e.
the X-ray Baldwin effect) in type-I active galactic nuclei has been confirmed
over the last years by several studies carried out with XMM-Newton, Chandra and
Suzaku. However, so far no general consensus on the origin of this trend has
been reached. Several works have proposed the decrease of the covering factor
of the molecular torus with the luminosity (in the framework of the
luminosity-dependent unification models) as a possible explanation for the
X-ray Baldwin effect. Using the fraction of obscured sources measured by recent
X-ray and IR surveys as a proxy of the half-opening angle of the torus, and the
recent Monte-Carlo simulations of the X-ray radiation reprocessed by a
structure with a spherical-toroidal geometry by Ikeda et al. (2009) and
Brightman & Nandra (2011), we test the hypothesis that the X-ray Baldwin effect
is related to the decrease of the half-opening angle of the torus with the
luminosity. Simulating the spectra of an unabsorbed population with a
luminosity-dependent covering factor of the torus as predicted by recent X-ray
surveys, we find that this mechanism is able to explain the observed X-ray
Baldwin effect. Fitting the simulated data with a log-linear L_{2-10keV}-EW
relation, we found that in the Seyfert regime (L_{2-10keV}< 10^44.2 erg s^-1)
luminosity-dependent unification produces a slope consistent with the
observations for average values of the equatorial column densities of the torus
of log N_H^T > 23.1. In the quasar regime (L_{2-10 keV}> 10^44.2 erg s^-1) a
decrease of the covering factor of the torus with the luminosity slower than
that observed in the Seyfert regime (as found by recent hard X-ray surveys) is
able to reproduce the observations for 23.2 < log N_H^T < 24.2.

""arabesques"", defined as closed chains of 2-element negative circuits. An
$n$-dimensional arabesque system has $n$ 2-element circuits, but in addition,
it displays by construction, two $n$-element circuits which are both positive
vs one positive and one negative, depending on the parity (even or odd) of the
dimension $n$. In view of the absence of diagonal terms in their Jacobian
matrices, all these dynamical systems are conservative and consequently, they
can not possess any attractor. First, we analyze a linear variant of them which
we call ""arabesque 0"" or for short ""A0"". For increasing dimensions, the
trajectories are increasingly complex open tori. Next, we inserted a single
cubic nonlinearity that does not affect the signs of its circuits (that we call
""arabesque 1"" or for short ""A1""). These systems have three steady states,
whatever the dimension is, in agreement with the order of the nonlinearity. All
three are unstable, as there can not be any attractor in their state-space. The
3D variant (that we call for short ""A1\_3D"") has been analyzed in some detail
and found to display a complex mixed set of quasi-periodic and chaotic
trajectories. Inserting $n$ cubic nonlinearities (one per equation) in the same
way as above, we generate systems ""A2\_$n$D"". A2\_3D behaves essentially as
A1\_3D, in agreement with the fact that the signs of the circuits remain
identical. A2\_4D, as well as other arabesque systems with even dimension, has
two positive $n$-circuits and nine steady states. Finally, we investigate and
compare the complex dynamics of this family of systems in terms of their
symmetries.

using 1.0 fb^{-1} of data collected in 2011 with the LHCb detector. Significant
\Lambda_b^0 \rightarrow J/\psi \Lambda, \Xi_b^-\rightarrow J/\psi \Xi^- and
\Omega_b^- \rightarrow J/\psi \Omega^- signals are observed and the
corresponding masses are measured to be M(\Lambda_b^0) = 5619.53 \pm 0.13
(stat) \pm 0.45 (syst) MeV/c^2, M(\Xi_b^-) = 5795.8 \pm 0.9 (stat) \pm 0.4
(syst) MeV/c^2, M(\Omega_b^-) = 6046.0 \pm 2.2 (stat) \pm 0.5 (syst) MeV/c^2,
while the differences with respect to the \Lambda_b^0 mass are
M(\Xi_b^-)-M(\Lambda_b^0) = 176.2 \pm 0.9 (stat) \pm 0.1 (syst) MeV/c^2,
M(\Omega_b^-)-M(\Lambda_b^0) = 426.4 \pm 2.2 (stat) \pm 0.4 (syst) MeV/c^2.
These are the most precise mass measurements of the \Lambda_b^0, \Xi_b^- and
\Omega_b^- baryons to date. Averaging the above \Lambda_b^0 mass measurement
with that published by LHCb using 35 pb^{-1} of data collected in 2010 yields
M(\Lambda_b^0) = 5619.44 \pm 0.13 (stat) \pm 0.38 (syst) MeV/c^2.

successful calculations of band gap, temperature dependent resistance value
confirm its semi-conducting nature and explore its potential application in
various industries. This work throws some light on and helps further research.

We give a characterization of the set of operators along which an operator is
natural invertible in terms of prescribed range and nullspace. Finally, the
special case when the prescribed idempotent is the spectral projection is
discussed.

through the usage of diverse state equations for gases, paramagnets, and other
simple thermodynamic systems. As it is well-known, the universality of the
Carnot efficiency is easily demonstrated in a temperature-entropy diagram,
which means that the Carnot efficiecy is independent of the working substance.
In this present work we remark that the universality of the Carnot theorem goes
beyond the conventional state equations, and it is fulfilled by gas state
equations that do not behave as ideal gas in the dilution limit when the volume
is infinite. Some of these unconventional state equations have certain
thermodynamic ""anomalies"" that nonetheless do not forbid them from obeying the
Carnot theorem. We discuss how this very general behaviour arises from the
Maxwell relations, which are connected with a geometrical property expressed
through preserving area transformations. A rule is proposed to calculate the
Maxwell relations associated with a thermodynamic system by using the
preserving area relationships. In this way it is possible to calculate the
number of possible preserving area mappings by giving the number of possible
Jacobian identities between all pairs of thermodynamic variables included in
the corresponding Gibbs equation. This work is intended for undergraduate and
specialists in thermodynamics and related areas.

figure out properties and characteristics of such a space-time and derive
conclusions. We prove that in such an expanding space-time, the geodesics are
curved and more precisely, they fluctuate on the boundaries of the expanding
basic elements. The non existence of privileged expansion direction leads to
the existence of an infinity of fluctuating geodesics between any two locations
in this space-time, that provides a prediction of polarization in geometric
optics, and a prediction of an earlier acceleration of the expansion as for the
cosmic inflation model. This simulation is a case study and an example of
space-time with variable topology using the principle of variation of topology
via a transformation that creates holes.

Rafael Sendra, Juana Sendra","The Relation Between Offset and Conchoid Constructions",,,,,"math.AG cs.CG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The one-sided offset surface Fd of a given surface F is, roughly speaking,
obtained by shifting the tangent planes of F in direction of its oriented
normal vector. The conchoid surface Gd of a given surface G is roughly speaking
obtained by increasing the distance of G to a fixed reference point O by d.
Whereas the offset operation is well known and implemented in most CAD-software
systems, the conchoid operation is less known, although already mentioned by
the ancient Greeks, and recently studied by some authors. These two operations
are algebraic and create new objects from given input objects. There is a
surprisingly simple relation between the offset and the conchoid operation. As
derived there exists a rational bijective quadratic map which transforms a
given surface F and its offset surfaces Fd to a surface G and its conchoidal
surface Gd, and vice versa. Geometric properties of this map are studied and
illustrated at hand of some complete examples. Furthermore rational universal
parameterizations for offsets and conchoid surfaces are provided.

singularities on a compact Riemann surface $\Sigma$ can be thought of as the
pullback of the standard metric on the 2-sphere by a multi-valued locally
univalent meromorphic function $f$ on $\Sigma\backslash \{{\rm
singularities}\}$, called the {\it developing map} of the metric $g$. When the
developing map $f$ of such a metric $g$ on the compact Riemann surface $\Sigma$
has reducible monodromy, we show that, up to some M{\"" o}bius transformation on
$f$, the logarithmic differential $d\,(\log\, f)$ of $f$ turns out to be an
abelian differential of 3rd kind on $\Sigma$, which satisfies some properties
and is called a {\it character 1-form of} $g$. Conversely, given such an
abelian differential $\omega$ of 3rd kind satisfying the above properties, we
prove that there exists a unique conformal metric $g$ on $\Sigma$ with constant
curvature one and conical singularities such that one of its character 1-forms
coincides with $\omega$. This provides new examples of conformal metrics on
compact Riemann surfaces of constant curvature one and with singularities.
Moreover, we prove that the developing map is a rational function for a
conformal metric $g$ with constant curvature one and finite conical
singularities with angles in $2\pi\,{\Bbb Z}_{>1}$ on the two-sphere.

proposed by Haldane, is to consider the set of functions which have all their
zeros at a single point. Since a LLL wave function on a torus, supporting
$N_\phi$ magnetic flux quanta, is uniquely defined by the position of its
$N_\phi$ zeros, this defines a set of functions that are expected to be
localized around the point maximally far away form the zeros. These two
families of localized states have many properties in common with the coherent
states on the plane and on the sphere, {\em viz.} a resolution of unity and a

limit of our survey is 2 x 10-15 erg/cm^2/s in the soft (0.5 - 2 keV) band and

new dimensions stabilize to the right size, and the known mechanisms for doing
so require bulk scalars that couple to the branes. Because of these couplings
the energetics of dimensional stabilization competes with the energetics of the
Higgs vacuum, with potentially observable effects. These effects are
particularly strong for one or two extra dimensions because the bulk-Higgs
couplings can then be super-renormalizable or dimensionless. Experimental reach
for such extra-dimensional Higgs `portals' are stronger than for gravitational
couplings because they are less suppressed at low-energies. We compute how
Higgs-bulk coupling through such a portal with two extra dimensions back-reacts
onto properties of the Higgs boson. When the KK mass is smaller than the Higgs
mass, mixing with KK modes results in an invisible Higgs decay width,
missing-energy signals at high-energy colliders, and new mechanisms of energy
loss in stars and supernovae. Astrophysical bounds turn out to be complementary
to collider measurements, with observable LHC signals allowed by existing
constraints. We comment on the changes to the Higgs mass-coupling relationship

are studied using three-body core-neutron-neutron model for ${}^{16}$C.
Single-scattering approximation (SSA) of four-particle equations for transition
operators is used to calculate three- and four-cluster breakup amplitudes at
200 and 300 MeV/nucleon energy near proton-neutron ($pn$) quasi free scattering
(QFS) conditions. The differential cross section is sharply peaked at $pn$ QFS
point and decreases rapidly whenever kinematical conditions deviate from $pn$
QFS. The accuracy of the SSA for the three-cluster breakup is estimated from a
three-body model and is found to be as good as 6\% at higher reaction energies
in suitable angular regimes. Furthermore, under an additional approximation the
three-cluster breakup amplitude factorizes into the $pn$ transition operator
and the overlap integral of two- and three-particle bound states. That
approximation usually reduces the cross section, in some cases even up to 10\%.

blended by radioactive decay resulting from the activation of the spacecraft

usually thought to be turbulent, and often modelled as a viscosity. This acts
to take energy from the radial shear, enabling the flow of mass and angular
momentum in the radial direction. In a previous paper we discussed
observational evidence for the magnitude of this viscosity, and pointed out
discrepancies between these values and those obtained in numerical simulations.
In this paper we discuss the observational evidence for the magnitude of the
dissipative effects which act in non--planar discs, both to transfer and to
eliminate the non--planarity. Estimates based on the model by Ogilvie (1999),
which assumes a small--scale, isotropic viscosity, give alignment timescales
for fully ionized discs which are apparently too short by a factor of a few
compared with observations, although we emphasize that more detailed
computations as well as tighter observational constraints are required to
verify this conclusion. For discs with low temperature and conductivity, we
find that the timescales for disc alignment based on isotropic viscosity are
too short by around two orders of magnitude. This large discrepancy suggests
that our understanding of viscosity in quiescent discs is currently inadequate.

originating from a tribimaximal dominant structure with small departures

propose an alternative construction of the spacetime manifold which naturally
enables time anisotropy. We promote the role of curvature: the Ricci scalar R
at a given point sets the length scales for physical processes - including
gravity - in the local inertial frames enclosing that point. The manifold is a
patchwork of local regions; each region is Lorentz invariant and adopts a local
scale a_R defined as a_R = 1/sqrt|R|. In each local patch, the length scales of
physical processes are measured relatively to a_R, and only their dimensionless
ratios partake in the dynamics of physical processes. Time anisotropy arises by
requiring that the form - but not necessarily the parameters - of physical laws
be unchanged under variations of the local a_R as one moves on the manifold.
The time scaling is found to be dt ~ a_R^(3/2) whereas the spatial part scales
as dx ~ a_R.
  We show how to conjoin the local patches of the manifold in a way which
respects causality and special relativity, as well as the equivalence and
general covariance principles. All of Einstein's insights are preserved but the
parameters of physical laws are only valid locally and become functions of the
prevailing Ricci scalar. This alternative construction of the manifold permits
a unique choice for the Lagrangian of gravity coupled with matter. Curvature is
actively involved in the dynamics of physical processes by setting the scale
for them.
  In vacuo our theory takes the form of R^2 gravity and adopts a larger set of
solutions superseding those of Einstein-Hilbert action R. We provide two
solutions: one solution connects our work to Mannheim's theory of galactic
rotation curves; the other leads to novel properties for Schwarzschild black
holes. We apply the theory to address problems in cosmology and discuss its

model. By considering probe quarks one can show that the fermionic spectrum at
the intermediate temperatures (T_c < T < 2 T_c) has a gap between near-zero
modes and the bulk of the spectrum - one more hint supporting the two-component
model.

current across a quantum dot which is tunnel coupled to two leads at different
chemical potentials is calculated by the use of two objects referred to as
kernels. The stationary reduced density matrix of the quantum dot is determined
by the use of the density matrix kernel, while the current kernel is used in a
second step to determine the stationary current across the dot. If the
tunneling Hamiltonian is multiplied by a coupling parameter ``w``, then
everything, including the kernels, the stationary density matrix as well as the
stationary current, can be viewed as a function of w. In the time space, and at
every single and fixed time t, the kernels have the clear structure of a
convergent power series in w. Refer to the coefficients of these power series
as the orders of the kernels. It is intuitive to truncate the kernels at some
finite order and to perform remaining calculations by the use of the
corresponding approximate kernels. However, the quantities which actually
appear in the calculations are not the kernels as a function of time but rather
their Laplace transforms, and here only in the limit \lambda \to 0. The
statement that even in this limit the structure of a convergent power series in
the coupling parameter is still conserved is shown in the text. The statement
that the stationary density matrix and current are still analytic in the
coupling parameter is shown, assuming the quantum dot is the single impurity
Anderson model (SIAM). Finally, results for the kernels up to sixth order,
neglecting the doubly occupied state and assuming equal energies E_\uparrow=
E_\downarrow, are presented and discussed. In case the degenerate level lies
below the Fermi level, a zero bias resonance, getting more and more pronounced
with decreasing temperature, is expected.

Indeed, the imperfect CSIT also impacts the DoF region of frequency correlated

spreading. The proposed method aims to avoid such spreading by explicitly
modeling the signal of interest as a sum of sinusoids with time-varying
amplitudes. So as to accommodate abrupt changes, it is further assumed that the
amplitude/phase functions are approximately piecewise constant (i.e., their
time-derivatives are sparse). The proposed method is based on a convex
variational (optimization) approach wherein the total variation (TV) of the
amplitude functions are regularized subject to a perfect (or approximate)
reconstruction constraint. A computationally efficient algorithm is derived
based on convex optimization techniques. The proposed technique can be used to
perform band-pass filtering that is relatively insensitive to narrow-band
amplitude/phase jumps present in data, which normally pose a challenge (due to
transients, leakage, etc.). The method is illustrated using both synthetic

M_sun to ~10^-2 M_sun for 1.35-1.35 M_sun binaries and from ~5*10^-3 M_sun to
~2*10^-2 M_sun for 1.2-1.5 M_sun systems (with kinetic energies between
~5*10^49 erg and 10^51 erg). Correspondingly, the bolometric peak luminosities
of the optical transients of symmetric (asymmetric) mergers vary between
3*10^41 erg/s and 14*10^41 erg/s (9*10^41 erg/s and 14.5*10^41 erg/s) on
timescales between ~2 h and ~12 h. If these signals with absolute bolometric
magnitudes from -15.0 to -16.7 are measured, the tight correlation of their
properties with those of the merging NSs might provide valuable constraints on
the high-density EoS. The r-process nucleosynthesis exhibits a remarkable
robustness independent of the EoS, producing a nearly solar abundance pattern
above mass number 130. By the r-process content of the Galaxy and the average
production per event the Galactic merger rate is limited to 4*10^-5/yr
(4*10^-4/yr) for a soft (stiff) NS EoS, if NS mergers are the main source of
heavy r-nuclei. The production ratio of radioactive 232Th to 238U attains a
stable value of 1.64-1.67, which does not exclude NS mergers as potential
sources of heavy r-material in the most metal-poor stars.

We demonstrate that this ``statistical Witten effect"" directly implies that if
the surface of the topological insulator is neither gapless, nor spontaneously
breaks the symmetry, it necessarily supports an intrinsic two-dimensional
topological order. Moreover, the surface properties cannot be fully realized in
a purely 2d system. We also confirm that the surface phases of the bosonic

nonlinear driven dissipative media, starting from the fluctuating hydrodynamic
equations describing the system mesoscopic evolution. Interestingly, the action
associated to a path in mesoscopic phase-space, from which large-deviation
functions for macroscopic observables can be derived, has the same simple form
as in non-dissipative systems. This is a consequence of the quasi-elasticity of
microscopic dynamics, required in order to have a nontrivial competition
between diffusion and dissipation at the mesoscale. Euler-Lagrange equations
for the optimal density and current fields that sustain an arbitrary
dissipation fluctuation are also derived. A perturbative solution thereof shows
that the probability distribution of small fluctuations is always gaussian, as
expected from the central limit theorem. On the other hand, strong separation
from the gaussian behavior is observed for large fluctuations, with a
distribution which shows no negative branch, thus violating the
Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation theorem as expected from the irreversibility of
the dynamics. The dissipation large-deviation function exhibits simple and
general scaling forms for weakly and strongly dissipative systems, with large
fluctuations favored in the former case but heavily supressed in the latter.

GGM models with 3, 5 and 6 input parameters and reduce the fine-tuning by
assuming simple relations between them at the high scale. We are able to find
solutions which give the correct value of the light Higgs mass and are less
fine-tuned than models with standard gauge mediation (and with gravity
mediation), however one never finds fine-tung measure lower than about $10^2$
if one neglects the data on $g_\mu-2$ and and about four times more if one
takes the constraint given by $g_\mu-2$ into account. In general the current
$g_\mu-2$ data push the models towards the high fine-tuning region. It is
interesting to note, that once one removes the contributions to the finetuning
induced by $\mu$ and $B_\mu$, then in the case with neglected $g_\mu-2$
constraint one can easily find realistic vacua with fine-tuning of order 1 or
lower, while the fine-tung remains always large when the $g_\mu-2$ constraint
is enforced. One should note, that in the last case even a small shift of the
light Higgs mass towards smaller values both reduces fine-tuning and helps to
improve agreement of a model with $g_\mu-2$ data.

Using schemes, such as the variational cluster approximation (VCA) and the

diagonalization (ED), they argued that a single bath orbital per site of the
six-atom unit cell is insufficient and leads to the erroneous conclusion that
the system is gapped for all nonzero values of the onsite Coulomb interaction
$U$. In contrast, we point out here that, in the case of the honeycomb lattice,
six bath levels per six-site unit cell are perfectly adequate for the
description of short-range correlations. Instead, we demonstrate that it is the
violation of long-range translation symmetry inherent in CDMFT-like schemes
which opens a gap at Dirac points. The gap found at small $U$ therefore does
not correspond to a Mott gap. As a result, present CDMFT schemes are not

scale in individual cells. A key example is the partitioning of membrane-bound
proteins via lipid domain formation or cytoskeleton-induced corralling. Yet the
impact of this spatial heterogeneity on biochemical signaling processes is
poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that partitioning improves the
reliability of biochemical signaling. We exactly solve a stochastic model
describing a ubiquitous motif in membrane signaling. The solution reveals that
partitioning improves signaling reliability via two effects: it moderates the
non-linearity of the switching response, and it reduces noise in the response
by suppressing correlations between molecules. An optimal partition size arises
from a trade-off between minimizing the number of proteins per partition to
improve signaling reliability and ensuring sufficient proteins per partition to
maintain signal propagation. The predicted optimal partition size agrees
quantitatively with experimentally observed systems. These results persist in
spatial simulations with explicit diffusion barriers. Our findings suggest that
molecular partitioning is not merely a consequence of the complexity of
cellular substructures, but also plays an important functional role in cell
signaling.

threshold $1/2$ replaced by $1$. In the special case of self-similar sets $K
\subset \mathbb{R}^{3}$ without rotations, we obtain a full Marstrand type
projection theorem for one-parameter families of projections onto lines. The

Hochman, but the $\dim_{\mathrm{H}} K > 1$ part is new: with this assumption,

where large numbers of a given subgraph occur. The mean behavior of subgraph
counts is known, and only recently were the related large deviations results
discovered. Consequently, it is natural to ask, can one develop efficient
numerical schemes to estimate the probability of an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph
containing an excessively large number of a fixed given subgraph? Using the
large deviation principle we study an importance sampling scheme as a method to
numerically compute the small probabilities of large triangle counts occurring
within Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs. We show that the exponential tilt suggested
directly by the large deviation principle does not always yield an optimal
scheme. The exponential tilt used in the importance sampling scheme comes from
a generalized class of exponential random graphs. Asymptotic optimality, a
measure of the efficiency of the importance sampling scheme, is achieved by a
special choice of the parameters in the exponential random graph that makes it
indistinguishable from an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph conditioned to have many
triangles in the large network limit. We show how this choice can be made for
the conditioned Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs both in the replica symmetric phase as
well as in parts of the replica breaking phase to yield asymptotically optimal
numerical schemes to estimate this rare event probability.

across multiple non-colluding adversaries. Most work in privacy-aware data
sharing has considered disclosing summaries where the aggregate information
about the data is preserved, but sensitive user information is protected.
Nonetheless, there are applications, including online advertising, cloud
computing and crowdsourcing markets, where detailed and fine-grained user-data
must be disclosed. We consider a new data sharing paradigm and introduce the
problem of privacy-aware data partitioning, where a sensitive dataset must be
partitioned among k untrusted parties (adversaries). The goal is to maximize
the utility derived by partitioning and distributing the dataset, while
minimizing the amount of sensitive information disclosed. The data should be
distributed so that an adversary, without colluding with other adversaries,
cannot draw additional inferences about the private information, by linking
together multiple pieces of information released to her. The assumption of no
collusion is both reasonable and necessary in the above application domains
that require release of private user information. SPARSI enables us to formally
define privacy-aware data partitioning using the notion of sensitive properties
for modeling private information and a hypergraph representation for describing
the interdependencies between data entries and private information. We show
that solving privacy-aware partitioning is, in general, NP-hard, but for
specific information disclosure functions, good approximate solutions can be
found using relaxation techniques. Finally, we present a local search algorithm
applicable to generic information disclosure functions. We apply SPARSI
together with the proposed algorithms on data from a real advertising scenario
and show that we can partition data with no disclosure to any single
advertiser.

defined by the Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence between the actual posterior,

typically have to contend with spatial disorder such as obstacles that hinder
an individual's motion or communication with neighbors. We study swarming
particles, with both aligning and repulsive interactions, on percolated
networks where topological disorder is modeled by the random removal of lattice
bonds. We find that an infinitesimal amount of disorder can completely suppress
swarming for particles that utilize only alignment interactions suggesting that
alignment alone is insufficient. The addition of repulsive forces between
particles produces a critical phase transition from a collectively moving swarm
to a disordered gas-like state. This novel phase transition is entirely driven
by the amount of topological disorder in the particles environment and displays
critical features that are similar to those of 2D percolation, while occurring
at a value of disorder that is far from the percolation critical point.

is usually attributed to a two-stage process: atmospheric levitation by
pulsation-induced shock waves, followed by radiative acceleration of newly
formed dust grains. The dust transfers momentum to the surrounding gas through
collisions and thereby triggers a general outflow. Radiation-hydrodynamical
models of M-type AGB stars suggest that these winds can be driven by photon
scattering -- in contrast to absorption -- on Fe-free silicate grains of sizes
0.1--1\,$\mu$m. In this paper we study photometric constraints for wind-driving
dust species in M-type AGB stars, as part of an ongoing effort to identify
likely candidates among the grain materials observed in circumstellar
envelopes. To investigate the scenario of stellar winds driven by photon
scattering on dust, and to explore how different optical and chemical
properties of wind-driving dust species affect photometry we focus on two sets
of dynamical models atmospheres: (i) models using a detailed description for
the growth of Mg$_2$SiO$_4$ grains, taking into account both scattering and
absorption cross-sections when calculating the radiative acceleration, and (ii)
models using a parameterized dust description, constructed to represent
different chemical and optical dust properties. By comparing synthetic
photometry from these two sets of models to observations of M-type AGB stars we
can provide constraints on the properties of wind-driving dust species.
Photometry from wind models with a detailed description for the growth of
Mg$_2$SiO$_4$ grains reproduces well both the values and the time-dependent
behavior of observations of M-type AGB stars, providing further support for the
scenario of winds driven by photon scattering on dust.

bit of information has been recently derived for bursty communication when
information is available infrequently at random times at the transmitter. This
result assumes that the receiver is always in the listening mode and samples
all channel outputs until it makes a decision. If the receiver is constrained
to sample only a fraction f>0 of the channel outputs, what is the cost penalty
due to sparse output sampling?
  Remarkably, there is no penalty: regardless of f>0 the asynchronous capacity
per unit cost is the same as under full sampling, ie, when f=1. There is not
even a penalty in terms of decoding delay---the elapsed time between when
information is available until when it is decoded. This latter result relies on
the possibility to sample adaptively; the next sample can be chosen as a
function of past samples. Under non-adaptive sampling, it is possible to
achieve the full sampling asynchronous capacity per unit cost, but the decoding
delay gets multiplied by 1/f. Therefore adaptive sampling strategies are of
particular interest in the very sparse sampling regime.

latitude. Far from the Galactic plane (|b| > 30 degrees), the observed
gamma-ray emission is nearly invariant with latitude, and is consistent with
arising from inverse Compton scattering of the interstellar radiation field by
cosmic-ray electrons with an approximately power-law spectrum. The same
electrons in the presence of microgauss-scale magnetic fields can also generate
the the observed microwave ""haze"". At lower latitudes (b < 20 degrees), in
contrast, the spectrum of the emission correlated with the Bubbles possesses a
pronounced spectral feature peaking at 1-4 GeV (in E^2 dN/dE) which cannot be
generated by any realistic spectrum of electrons. Instead, we conclude that a
second (non-inverse-Compton) emission mechanism must be responsible for the
bulk of the low-energy, low-latitude emission. This second component is
spectrally similar to the excess GeV emission previously reported from the
Galactic Center (GC), and also appears spatially consistent with a luminosity
per volume falling approximately as r^-2.4, where r is the distance from the
GC. We argue that the spectral feature visible in the low-latitude Bubbles is
the extended counterpart of the GC excess, now detected out to at least 2-3 kpc
from the GC. The spectrum and angular distribution of the signal is consistent
with that predicted from ~10 GeV dark matter particles annihilating to leptons,
or from ~50 GeV dark matter particles annihilating to quarks, following a
distribution similar to the canonical Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile. We
also consider millisecond pulsars as a possible astrophysical explanation for
the signal, as observed millisecond pulsars possess a spectral cutoff at
approximately the required energy. Any such scenario would require a large
population of unresolved millisecond pulsars extending at least 2-3 kpc from
the GC.

compared with the properties of the Milky Way dSph population. We also measure
the average metallicity ([Fe/H]) from the co-added spectra of member stars for
each M31 dSph and find that they are consistent with the trend of decreasing
[Fe/H] with luminosity observed in the Milky Way population. We find that three
of our studied M31 dSphs appear as significant outliers in terms of their
central velocity dispersion, And XIX, XXI and XXV, all of which have large
half-light radii (>700 pc) and low velocity dispersions (sigma_v<5 km/s). In
addition, And XXV has a mass-to-light ratio within its half-light radius of

impacted by the hot X-ray emitting gas in the vicinity of \sgra. For a stellar
mass loss rate of $4\times10^{-8}$ \msun per yr and wind velocity 100 \kms, the
bow shock will have an emission measure ($EM = n^2 vol$) at a distance
$\sim10^{16}$ cm, similar to that inferred from the IR emission lines. The
ionization of the dense bow shock gas is potentially provided by collisional
ionization at the shock front and cooling radiation (X-ray and UV) from the
post shock gas. The former would predict a constant line flux as a function of
distance from \sgra, while the latter will have increasing emission at lesser
distances. In this model, the star and its mass loss wind should survive
pericenter passage since the wind is likely launched at 0.2 AU and this is much
less than the Roche radius at pericenter ($\sim3$ AU for a stellar mass of
2\msun). In this model, the emission cloud will probably survive pericenter
passage, discriminating this scenario from others.

supersymmetry (B-type) on the boundary are classified in terms of subspaces of
the target space (""brane""). An A-type brane is a Lagrangian submanifold on
which the imaginary part of the superpotential is constant, while a B-type
brane is a holomorphic submanifold on which the superpotential is constant. We
also consider the N = 2 Maxwell theory with boundary and the abelian duality.
Finally we make some comments on N = 2 SQED with boundary condition and the
mirror symmetry.

-1.1. With the possible exception of Segue 1 and Ursa Major II, the individual
UFDs show on average lower [alpha/Fe] at higher metallicities, consistent with
enrichment from Type Ia supernovae. Thus even the faintest galaxies have
undergone at least a limited level of chemical self-enrichment. Together with
recent photometric studies, this suggests that star formation in the UFDs was
not a single burst, but instead lasted at least as much as the minimum time
delay of the onset of Type Ia supernovae (~100 Myr) and less than ~2 Gyr. We
further show that the combined population of UFDs has an [alpha/Fe] abundance
pattern that is inconsistent with a flat, Galactic halo-like alpha abundance
trend, and is also qualitatively different from that of the more luminous CVn I
dSph, which does show a hint of a plateau at very low [Fe/H].

reduces the age-extinction degeneracy of optical colours, thus enabling the

includes two AGN hosts. This first paper outlines the survey itself, the
observational datasets, the analysis methods, and presents a proof-of-concept
study of the large-scale properties and star cluster population of NGC 4041, a
massive SAbc galaxy at a distance of 23 Mpc, and part of a small grouping of
six giant members. We resolve two structural components with distinct stellar
populations, a morphology more akin to merging and interacting systems. We also
find strong evidence of a truncated, Schechter-type mass function, and a
similarly segmented luminosity function. These results indicate that binning
must erase much of the substructure present in the mass and luminosity
functions, and might account for the conflicting reports on the intrinsic shape
of these functions in the literature. We also note a tidal feature in the
outskirts of the galaxy in GALEX UV imaging, and follow it up with a
comprehensive multi-wavelength study of NGC 4041 and its parent group. We
deduce a minor merger as a likely cause of its segmented structure and the
observed pattern of a radially decreasing star formation rate. We propose that
combining the study of star cluster populations with broad-band metrics is not

neutrino with a given energy along some ray through a turbulent supernova are
random variates unique to each ray. If the source of the neutrinos were a point
then all neutrinos of a given energy and emitted at the same time which were
detected in some far off location would have seen the same turbulent profile
therefore their transition probabilities would be exactly correlated. But if
the source has a finite size then the profiles seen by neutrinos emitted from
different points at the source will have seen different turbulence and the
correlation of the transition probabilities will be reduced. In this paper we
study the correlation of the neutrino transition probabilities through
turbulent supernova profiles as a function of the separation between the
emission points using an isotropic and an anisotropic power spectrum for the
random field used to model the turbulence. The spectral features in the high
density resonance mixing channel of the next Galactic supernova neutrino burst
may be strongly obscured by large amplitude turbulence when it enters the
signal due to the finite size of the source while the presence of features in
the low density and non resonant mixing channels may persist, the exact amount
depending upon the degree of anisotropy of the turbulence.

antenna placement problem or the cell planning problem, involves locating and
configuring infrastructure for mobile networks by modified the original
Partitioning Around Medoids PAM algorithm. M-PAM (Modified Partitioning Around
Medoids) has been proposed to satisfy the requirements and constraints. PAM
needs to specify number of clusters (k) before starting to search for the best

to determine k. We calculate for each cluster its coverage and capacity and
determine if they satisfy the mobile requirements, if not we will increase (k)

of this algorithm to a real case study is presented. Experimental results and
analysis indicate that the M-PAM algorithm when applying method two is
effective in case of heavy load distribution, and leads to minimum number of
base stations, which directly affected onto the cost of planning the network.

terrestrial exoplanets with sulfur compounds (i.e., H2S and SO2) emitted from
their surfaces. We use a comprehensive one-dimensional photochemistry model and
radiative transfer model to investigate the sulfur chemistry in atmospheres
ranging from reducing to oxidizing. The most important finding is that both H2S
and SO2 are chemically short-lived in virtually all types of atmospheres on
terrestrial exoplanets, based on models of H2, N2, and CO2 atmospheres. This
implies that direct detection of surface sulfur emission is unlikely, as their
surface emission rates need to be extremely high (>1000 times Earth's volcanic
sulfur emission) for these gases to build up to a detectable level. We also
find that sulfur compounds emitted from the surface lead to photochemical
formation of elemental sulfur and sulfuric acid in the atmosphere, which would
condense to form aerosols if saturated. For terrestrial exoplanets in the
habitable zone of Sun-like stars or M stars, Earth-like sulfur emission rates
result in optically thick haze composed of elemental sulfur in reducing
H2-dominated atmospheres for a wide range of particle diameters (0.1-1 micron),
which is assumed as a free parameter in our simulations. In oxidized
atmospheres composed of N2 and CO2, optically thick haze, composed of elemental
sulfur aerosols (S8) or sulfuric acid aerosols (H2SO4), will form if the
surface sulfur emission is 2 orders of magnitude more than the volcanic sulfur
emission of Earth. Although direct detection of H2S and SO2 by their spectral
features is unlikely, their emission might be inferred by observing
aerosol-related features in reflected light with future generation space
telescopes.

diluted by competing effects such as direct water proton saturation (spillover)
and macromolecular magnetization transfer (MT). This leads to T2-and
MT-shine-through effects in the actual biochemical contrast of CEST. Therefore,
a simple evaluation algorithm which corrects the CEST signal was searched for.
By employing a recent eigenspace theory valid for spinlock and continuous wave
(cw) CEST we predict that the inverse Z-spectrum is beneficial to Z-spectrum
itself. Based on this we propose a new spillover- and MT-corrected
magnetization transfer ratio (MTRRex) yielding Rex, the exchange dependent
relaxation rate in the rotating frame. For verification, the amine proton
exchange of creatine in solutions with different agar concentration was studied
experimentally at clinical field strength of 3T. In contrast to the compared
standard evaluation for pulsed CEST experiments, MTRasym, our approach shows no
T2 or MT shine through effect. We demonstrate that spillover can be corrected
properly and also quantitative evaluation of pH and creatine concentration is
possible which proves MTRRex as quantitative CEST-MRI method. A spillover
correction is of special interest for clinical static field strengths and
protons resonating near the water peak. This is the case for -OH-CEST effects
like gagCEST or glucoCEST, but also amine exchange of creatine or glutamate
which require high B1. Although, only showed for amine exchange, we propose our
normalization to work generally for DIACEST, PARACEST in slow- and fast

Applied to acute stroke induced in rat brain, the corrected CEST signal shows

errors. Interferometry proves to be a promising approach for overcoming such a
challenge. In this paper we present a complete simulation pipeline of
interferometric observations of CMB polarization, including systematic errors.
We employ two different methods for obtaining the power spectra from mock data
produced by simulated observations: the maximum likelihood method and the
method of Gibbs sampling. We show that the results from both methods are
consistent with each other, as well as, within a factor of 6, with analytical
estimates. Several categories of systematic errors are considered: instrumental
errors, consisting of antenna gain and antenna coupling errors, and beam
errors, consisting of antenna pointing errors, beam cross-polarization and beam
shape (and size) errors. In order to recover the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$,
within a 10% tolerance level, which ensures the experiment is sensitive enough
to detect the $B$-signal at $r=0.01$ in the multipole range $28 < \ell < 384$,
we find that, for a QUBIC-like experiment, Gaussian-distributed systematic
errors must be controlled with precisions of $|g_{rms}| = 0.1$ for antenna

filamentary stellar structures, loops and plumes in the vicinity of the Virgo
Cluster, edge-on spiral galaxy, NGC 4216 that were previously identified by the
Blackbird Telescope. Using the deeper, higher-resolution and precisely
calibrated optical CFHT/MegaCam images obtained as part of the Next Generation
Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS), we confirm the previously identified features and
identify a few additional structures. The NGVS data allowed us to make a
physical study of these low-surface brightness features and investigate their
origin. The likely progenitors of the structures were identified as either
already catalogued VCC dwarfs or newly discovered satellites caught in the act
of being destroyed. They have the same g-i color index and likely contain
similar stellar populations. The alignment of three dwarfs along an apparently
single stream is intriguing, and we cannot totally exclude that these are
second-generation dwarf galaxies being born inside the filament from the debris
of an original dwarf. The observed complex structures, including in particular
a stream apparently emanating from a satellite of a satellite, point to a high
rate of ongoing dwarf destruction/accretion in the region of the Virgo Cluster
where NGC 4216 is located. We discuss the age of the interactions and whether
they occurred in a group that is just falling into the cluster and shows signs
of so-called ""pre-processing"" before it gets affected by the cluster
environment, or in a group which already ventured towards the central regions
of Virgo Cluster.

subject during several years. Many important models have been proposed in
literature for improving the accuracy and effectiveness of time series
forecasting. The aim of this dissertation work is to present a concise
description of some popular time series forecasting models used in practice,
with their salient features. In this thesis, we have described three important
classes of time series models, viz. the stochastic, neural networks and SVM
based models, together with their inherent forecasting strengths and
weaknesses. We have also discussed about the basic issues related to time
series modeling, such as stationarity, parsimony, overfitting, etc. Our
discussion about different time series models is supported by giving the
experimental forecast results, performed on six real time series datasets.
While fitting a model to a dataset, special care is taken to select the most
parsimonious one. To evaluate forecast accuracy as well as to compare among
different models fitted to a time series, we have used the five performance
measures, viz. MSE, MAD, RMSE, MAPE and Theil's U-statistics. For each of the
six datasets, we have shown the obtained forecast diagram which graphically
depicts the closeness between the original and forecasted observations. To have
authenticity as well as clarity in our discussion about time series modeling
and forecasting, we have taken the help of various published research works
from reputed journals and some standard books.

description of its slow relaxation processes, involving (i) identification of
the structural changes involved in these processes, and (ii) estimation of the
rates or timescales at which these slow processes occur. Most of the approaches
to this task, including Markov models, Master-equation models, and kinetic
network models, start by discretizing the high-dimensional state space and then
characterize relaxation processes in terms of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues
of a discrete transition matrix. The practical success of such an approach
depends very much on the ability to finely discretize the slow order
parameters. How can this task be achieved in a high-dimensional configuration
space without relying on subjective guesses of the slow order parameters? In
this paper, we use the variational principle of conformation dynamics to derive
an optimal way of identifying the ""slow subspace"" of a large set of prior order
parameters - either generic internal coordinates (distances and dihedral
angles), or a user-defined set of parameters. It is shown that a method to
identify this slow subspace exists in statistics: the time-lagged independent
component analysis (TICA). Furthermore, optimal indicators-order parameters
indicating the progress of the slow transitions and thus may serve as reaction
coordinates-are readily identified. We demonstrate that the slow subspace is
well suited to construct accurate kinetic models of two sets of molecular
dynamics simulations, the 6-residue fluorescent peptide MR121-GSGSW and the
30-residue natively disordered peptide KID. The identified optimal indicators
reveal the structural changes associated with the slow processes of the
molecular system under analysis.

In this paper, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) approach is used to
enhance the forecasting strengths of feedforward ANN (FANN) as well as Elman
ANN (EANN) models for seasonal data. Three widely popular versions of the basic
PSO algorithm, viz. Trelea-I, Trelea-II and Clerc-Type1 are considered here.
The empirical analysis is conducted on three real-world seasonal time series.
Results clearly show that each version of the PSO algorithm achieves notably
better forecasting accuracies than the standard Backpropagation (BP) training
method for both FANN and EANN models. The neural network forecasting results
are also compared with those from the three traditional statistical models,
viz. Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), Holt-Winters

PSO and BP based neural networks outperform SARIMA, HW and SVM models for all

improved through combining the outputs from the three PSO based models.

of travel times and number of stops for each traversed road segment using a
`stop-and-go' algorithm developed for this work. The compressed data is then
used as input for training a path travel time model, which couples a Markov

play an important role in shaping the physical properties of galaxies before
entering massive clusters at low redshift, and transformations of satellite
galaxies likely dominate the buildup of local environmental correlations. To
illuminate the physical processes that shape galaxy evolution in dense
environments, we study a sample of 116 X-ray selected galaxy groups at z=0.2-1
with halo masses of 10^13-10^14 M_sun and centroids determined with weak
lensing. We analyze morphologies based on HST imaging and colors determined
from 31 photometric bands for a stellar mass-limited population of 923
satellite galaxies and a comparison sample of 16644 field galaxies. Controlling
for variations in stellar mass across environments, we find significant trends
in the colors and morphologies of satellite galaxies with group-centric
distance and across cosmic time. Specifically at low stellar mass
(log(M_stellar/M_sun) = 9.8-10.3), the fraction of disk-dominated star-forming
galaxies declines from >50% among field galaxies to <20% among satellites near
the centers of groups. This decline is accompanied by a rise in quenched
galaxies with intermediate bulge+disk morphologies, and only a weak increase in
red bulge-dominated systems. These results show that both color and morphology
are influenced by a galaxy's location within a group halo. We suggest that
strangulation and disk fading alone are insufficient to explain the observed
morphological dependence on environment, and that galaxy mergers or close tidal
encounters must play a role in building up the population of quenched galaxies
with bulges seen in dense environments at low redshift.

our results with literature data, the mean number density at 0 < z < 4 is not

divided our entire HI absorbers at 1.9 < z < 3.2 into two samples, the
unenriched forest and the CIV-enriched forest, depending on whether HI lines

combination of these two well-characterised populations which overlap at log

similar power-law distribution to the entire forest. The CIV-enriched forest
dominates at log N(HI) > 15, with its distribution function proportional to
N(HI)^(-1.45). However, it starts to flatten out at lower N(HI), since the
enriched forest fraction decreases with decreasing N(HI). The deviation from
the power law at log N(HI) = [14, 17] shown in the CDDF for the entire HI
sample is a result of combining two different HI populations with a different
CDDF shape. The total HI mass density relative to the critical density is
Omega(HI) ~ 1.6 x 10^(-6) h^(-1), where the enriched forest accounts for ~40%

necessarily that of consumers. The social consequence of a top-down approach to
product development has been a large failure rate in new product introduction.
By surveying potential customers, a refined target is created that guides
developers and reduces the failure rate. Today, however, the proliferation of
products and the emergence of consumer choice has resulted in the
identification of segments within the market. Understanding your target market
typically involves conducting a product category assessment, where 12 to 30
commercial products are tested with consumers to create a preference map. Every
consumer gets to test every product in a complete-block design; however, many
classes of products do not lend themselves to such approaches because only a
few samples can be evaluated before `fatigue' sets in. We consider an analysis

estimation. This PEM algorithm circumvents the need for a traditional E-step,
by performing a partial E-step that reduces the Kullback-Leibler divergence

assembly and growth of massive galaxies, in particular the Early-Type Galaxies
(ETGs), is, below a redshift of 1, mainly due to the accretion of multiple
gas--poor satellites. In order to get observational evidence of the role played
by minor dry mergers, we are obtaining extremely deep optical images of a
complete volume limited sample of nearby ETGs.
  These observations, done with the CFHT as part of the \AD, NGVS and MATLAS
projects, reach a stunning 28.5)29 mag.arcsec-2 surface brightness limit in the
g' band. They allow us to detect the relics of past collisions such as faint
stellar tidal tails as well as the very extended stellar halos which keep the
memory of the last episodes of galactic accretion.
  Images and preliminary results from this on-going survey are presented, in
particular a possible correlation between the fine structure index (which
parametrizes the amount of tidal perturbation) of the ETGs, their stellar mass,
effective radius and gas content.

and evolution. The large abundance gradient across M101 (a factor of 20)
suggests that many more WR stars must be found in the inner parts of this
galaxy than in the outer regions. Many HII regions and massive star-forming
complexes have been identified in M101; they should be rich in WR stars, and
surrounded by RSG stars. Finally, the Wolf-Rayet stars in M101 may be abundant
enough for one to explode as a Type Ib or Ic supernova and/or GRB within a
generation. The clear identification of the progenitor of a Type Ib or Ic
supernova as a WR star would be a major confirmation of current stellar
evolution theory.
  Motivated by these considerations, we have used the Hubble Space Telescope to
carry out a deep, HeII optical narrowband imaging survey of the massive star
populations in the ScI spiral galaxy M101. Combined with archival broadband
images, we were able to image almost the entire galaxy with the unprecedented
depth and resolution that only HST affords.
  We describe the extent of the survey and our images, as well as our data
reduction procedures. A detailed study of a field east of the center of M101,
containing the giant star-forming region NGC 5462, demonstrates how we find
candidates, their properties and spatial distribution, and how we rule out most
contaminants. The spatial distributions of the WR and RSG stars near a giant
star-forming complex are strikingly different. WR stars dominate the complex
core, while RSG dominate the complex halo. Future papers in this series will
describe and catalog more than a thousand WR and RSG candidates that are
detectable in our images, as well as spectra of many of those candidates.

transceiver designs a novel weighted MSE model is proposed, which is defined as
a linear matrix function with respect to the traditional data detection MSE
matrix. The new model can be interpreted an extension of weighting operation
from vector field to matrix field. Based on the proposed weighting operation a
general transceiver design is proposed, which aims at minimizing an increasing
matrix-monotone function of the output of the previous linear matrix function.
The structure of the optimal solutions is also derived. Furthermore, two
important special cases of the matrix-monotone functions are discussed in
detail. It is also revealed that these two problems are exactly equivalent to
the transceiver designs of sum MSE minimization and capacity maximization for
dual-hop amplify-and-forward (AF) MIMO relaying systems, respectively. Finally,
it is concluded that the AF relaying is undoubtedly this kind of weighting
operation.

(qubits) and probes of decoherence, requires protocols for their
initialization, unitary manipulation, and readout. In many solid-state quantum
systems, these operations rely on disparate techniques that can vary widely
depending on the particular qubit structure. One such qubit, the
nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center spin in diamond, can be initialized and read out
through its special spin selective intersystem crossing, while microwave
electron spin resonance (ESR) techniques provide unitary spin rotations.
Instead, we demonstrate an alternative, fully optical approach to these control
protocols in an NV center that does not rely on its intersystem crossing. By
tuning an NV center to an excited-state spin anticrossing at cryogenic
temperatures, we use coherent population trapping and stimulated Raman
techniques to realize initialization, readout, and unitary manipulation of a
single spin. Each of these techniques can be directly performed along any
arbitrarily-chosen quantum basis, removing the need for extra control steps to
map the spin to and from a preferred basis. Combining these protocols, we
perform measurements of the NV center's spin coherence, a demonstration of this
full optical control. Consisting solely of optical pulses, these techniques
enable control within a smaller footprint and within photonic networks.
Likewise, this approach obviates the need for both ESR manipulation and spin
addressability through the intersystem crossing. This method could therefore be
applied to a wide range of potential solid-state qubits, including those which
currently lack a means to be addressed.

emissions, respectively. When we consider only bright ($M_{r}$ $<$ $-$21.5)

formation is still 39%. The quiescent red-sequence galaxies with mid-IR and
near-UV excess emissions are optically fainter and have slightly smaller
$D_{n}$4000 than those without mid-IR and near-UV excess emissions. We also
find that mid-IR weighted mean stellar ages of quiescent red-sequence galaxies
with mid-IR excess are larger than those with near-UV excess, and smaller than
those without mid-IR and near-UV excess. The environmental dependence of the
fraction of quiescent red-sequence galaxies with mid-IR and near-UV excess
seems strong even though the trends of quiescent red-sequence galaxies with
near-UV excess differ from those with mid-IR excess. These results indicate
that the recent star formation traced by near-UV ($\lesssim 1$ Gyr) and mid-IR
($\lesssim 2$ Gyr) excess is not negligible among nearby, quiescent, red,

We
explore the possibility of a boundary-induced phase transition for the chiral
symmetry of QCD. In particular, we investigate the consequences of imposing
homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions on the quark fields. Such boundary
conditions are sometimes employed in lattice gauge theory computations, for
example, when including external electromagnetic fields, or when computing
quark propagators with a reduced temporal extent. Homogeneous Dirichlet
boundary conditions force the chiral condensate to vanish at the boundary, and
thereby obstruct the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in the bulk. We
show the restoration of chiral symmetry due to a boundary is a non-perturbative
phenomenon depending upon the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking, and
utilize the sigma model to exemplify the issues. Within this model, we find
that chiral symmetry is completely restored if the length of the compact
direction is less than 2.0 fm. For lengths greater than about 4 fm, an
approximately uniform chiral condensate forms centered about the midpoint of
the compact direction. While the volume-averaged condensate approaches the
infinite volume value as the compact direction becomes very long, the
finite-size corrections are shown to be power law rather than exponential.

measurements (sensors) and REM accuracy. In this paper, we analyze this
tradeoff and determine that the REM error is a decreasing and convex function
of the number of measurements (sensors). The concept of geographic entropy is
introduced to quantify this relationship. And the influence of sensor
deployment on REM accuracy is examined using information theory techniques. The
results obtained in this paper are applicable not only for the REM, but also
for wireless sensor network deployment.

gamma-rays from magnetars. The magnetars have shown frequent X-ray bursts,
which would be triggered by crust fractures and could release the energy of
order of ~10^{41-42}erg. If the location of the crust cracking of the magnetic
field is close to the magnetic pole, part of the released energy may excite the
Alfevn wave that can propagate into outer magnetosphere. The oscillation of the
magnetic field induces the available potential drop ~10^{15}Volts, which can
accelerate the electrons and/or positrons to the Lorentz factor ~10^{7} in the
outer magnetosphere. The curvature radiation process at outer magnetosphere can
produce GeV gamma-rays. If the radiation process is occurred above r~5x 10^7cm
from the stellar surface, the emitted GeV gamma-rays can escape from the
pair-creation process with the X-rays and/or the magnetic field. The expected
luminosity of the GeV emissions is order of L_{\gamma}< 10^{35} erg/s, and the
radiation process will last for a temporal scale of years. The expected pulse
profiles have a broad shape with sometimes sharp peaks. We apply the model to

with PCA Tomography and spectral synthesis revealed the existence of
collimation and scattering of the AGN featureless continuum and also of a broad
component of the H{\alpha} emission line. The collimation and scattering of
this broad H{\alpha} component was also revealed by fitting the [NII]
{\lambda}{\lambda}6548,6583 and H{\alpha} emission lines as a sum of Gaussian
functions. The spectral synthesis, together with a V-I image obtained with the
Hubble Space Telescope, showed the existence of circumnuclear dust, which may
cause the light scattering. We also identify a dusty feature that may be
interpreted as a torus/disk structure. The existence of two opposite regions
with featureless continuum (P.A. = -18{\deg} +/- 13{\deg} and P.A. = 162{\deg}
+/- 13{\deg}) along a direction perpendicular to the torus/disk (P.A. =
72{\deg} +/- 14{\deg}) suggests that this structure is approximately edge-on

broad-line region. The proposed scenario is compatible with the Unified Model

that arise in gravitational collapse are always hidden inside of black holes,
invisible to distant observers. This conjecture, put forward by Penrose more
than four decades ago, is widely believed to be one of the basic principles of
nature. However, a complete proof of this hypothesis is still lacking and the
validity of the conjecture has therefore remained one of the most important
open questions in general relativity. In this study we analyze a gedanken
experiment which is designed to challenge cosmic censorship by trying to
overcharge a Reissner-Nordstr\""om black hole: a charged shell is lowered {\it
adiabatically} into the charged black hole. The mass-energy delivered to the
black hole can be red-shifted by letting the dropping point of the shell
approach the black-hole horizon. On the other hand, the electric charge of the
shell is not red-shifted by the gravitational field of the black hole. It
therefore seems, at first sight, that the charged shell is not hindered from
entering the black hole, overcharging it and removing its horizon. However, in
the present study we prove that the exposure of a naked singularity to distant
observers is actually excluded due to the formation of a new (and {\it larger})
horizon around the original black hole. Moreover, we shall prove that this new
horizon is already formed {\it before} the charged shell crosses the original
black-hole horizon. This result, which seems to have been previously
overlooked, guarantees the validity of the weak cosmic censorship conjecture in
this type of gedanken experiments.

algorithm to list decode these folded codes up to an error fraction approaching
$1-R$ where $R$ is the rate. The list decoding can be performed in polynomial
time given polynomial amount of pre-processed information about the function

constraints of trips are satisfied. We first propose two basic algorithms: a
branch-and-bound algorithm and an integer programing algorithm. However, these
algorithm structures do not adapt well to the dynamic nature of the ridesharing
problem. Thus, we then propose a kinetic tree algorithm capable of better
scheduling dynamic requests and adjusting routes on-the-fly. We perform
experiments on a large real taxi dataset from Shanghai. The results show that
the kinetic tree algorithm is faster than other algorithms in response time.

collection of approaches for harnessing such distributed human intelligence.
Recently, the bioinformatics community has begun to apply crowdsourcing in a
variety of contexts, yet few resources are available that describe how these
human-powered systems work and how to use them effectively in scientific
domains. Results: Here, we provide a framework for understanding and applying
several different types of crowdsourcing. The framework considers two broad
classes: systems for solving large-volume 'microtasks' and systems for solving
high-difficulty 'megatasks'. Within these classes, we discuss system types
including: volunteer labor, games with a purpose, microtask markets and open
innovation contests. We illustrate each system type with successful examples in
bioinformatics and conclude with a guide for matching problems to crowdsourcing

potential, which when falls below the noninteracting band minimum, signals the
onset of a phase with tightly bound, shorter pairs. As an evidence of the above

density for the nontrivial phase, while it remains sign unchanged for the

could provide tighter constrains on Saturn's internal structure. Also,
occultation measurements provide important information on the planetary shape
which is often not considered in structure models. In this paper we explore how
wind velocities and internal rotation affect the planetary shape and the
constraints on Saturn's interior. We show that within the geodetic approach
(Lindal et al., 1985, ApJ, 90, 1136) the derived physical shape is insensitive
to the assumed deep rotation. Saturn's re-derived equatorial and polar radii at
100 mbar are found to be 54,445 $\pm$10 km and 60,365$\pm$10 km, respectively.
To determine Saturn's interior we use {\it 1 D} three-layer hydrostatic
structure models, and present two approaches to include the constraints on the
shape. These approaches, however, result in only small differences in Saturn's
derived composition. The uncertainty in Saturn's rotation period is more
significant: with Voyager's 10h39mns period, the derived mass of heavy elements
in the envelope is 0-7 M$_{\oplus}$. With a rotation period of 10h32mns, this
value becomes $<4$ $M_{\oplus}$, below the minimum mass inferred from
spectroscopic measurements. Saturn's core mass is found to depend strongly on
the pressure at which helium phase separation occurs, and is estimated to be
5-20 M$_{\oplus}$. Lower core masses are possible if the separation occurs
deeper than 4 Mbars. We suggest that the analysis of Cassini's radio
occultation measurements is crucial to test shape models and could lead to
constraints on Saturn's rotation profile and departures from hydrostatic
equilibrium.

show that when using spread spectrum codes in the signal domain, the CS

Compressive Spread Spectrum (CSS), allows for a simple, effective receiver

the bit error rate performance is degraded by the subsampling in the CS-enabled
receivers, this may be remedied by including quantization in the receiver

significant errors in the estimated MEG yields. We develop a methodology to
determine proper scaling factors to the signals from the transient absorption
experiments. Using the methodology we find modest MEG yields in lead
chalcogenide nanocrystals including the nanorods.

promising new path in data analysis and de-trending of exoplanetary time series
signals. Such approaches do not require or assume any prior or auxiliary
knowledge on the data or instrument in order to de-convolve the astrophysical
light curve signal from instrument or stellar systematic noise. These methods
are often known as 'blind source separation' (BSS) algorithms. Unfortunately
all BSS methods suffer from a amplitude and sign ambiguity of their
de-convolved components which severely limits these methods in low
signal-to-noise (S/N) observations where their scalings cannot be determined
otherwise. Here we present a novel approach to calibrate ICA using sparse
wavelet calibrators. The Amplitude Calibrated Independent Component Analysis
(ACICA) allows for the direct retrieval of the independent components' scalings
and the robust de-trending of low S/N data. Such an approach gives us an unique
and unprecedented insight in the underlying morphology of a data set, making
this method a powerful tool for exoplanetary data de-trending and signal
diagnostics.

the existence of massive sterile neutrinos in both (3+1) and (3+2) scenarios,
and with the inclusion of SBL data the evidence is formally at the 3.3sigma
level in the case of a (3+1) model. Interestingly, cosmological and SBL data
both point to the same mass scale of approximately 1 eV. In the (3+1) framework
WMAP9+SPT provide a value of the sterile mass eigenstate m_4 = (1.72 \pm 0.65)
eV: this result is strenghtened by adding the prior from SBL posterior to m_4 =
(1.27 \pm 0.12) eV (m_4 = (1.23 \pm 0.13) eV when SDSS is also considered in
the cosmological analysis). In the (3+2) scheme, two additional, non--fully
thermalized, neutrinos are compatible with the whole set of cosmological and
SBL data, leading to mass values of m_4 = (0.95 \pm 0.30) eV and m_5 = (1.59

divergences of pressure and shear stress similar to the situation near the

smaller than those of the sheared granular systems, and are close to the
extrapolation from the kinetic theoretical regime. In a similar manner to the
jam- ming for frictional grains, the critical density decreases as the friction
constant of grains increases. For bi-disperse systems, the effective friction
constant defined as the ratio of shear stress to normal stress, monotonically
increases from near zero, as the strain rate increases. On the other hand, the
effective friction constant has two metastable branches for mono-disperse
systems because of the coexistence of a crystallized state and a liquid state.

investigated, mostly by using compulsory public good games. Recently, Sasaki et
al. (2012, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 109:1165-1169) considered optional
participation as well as institutional incentives and described how the
interplay between these mechanisms affects the evolution of cooperation in
public good games. Here, we present a full classification of these evolutionary

bi-stability of both cooperation and defection in cases in which participation
in the public good game is compulsory, these penalties will ultimately result
in cooperation if participation in the public good game is optional. The global
stability of coercion-based cooperation in this optional case contrasts
strikingly with the bi-stability that is observed in the compulsory case. We
also argue that optional participation is not so effective at improving
cooperation under rewards.

ubiquitous phenomena in ultrafast science, such as the dynamical evolution of
the electron density during complex chemical and biological processes.
Scattering of ultrashort x-ray pulses from an electronic wavepacket would
appear to be the most obvious approach to image the electronic motion in
real-time and real-space with the notion that such scattering patterns, in the
far-field regime, encode the instantaneous electron density of the wavepacket.
However, recent results by Dixit {\em et al.} [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,
{\bf 109}, 11636 (2012)] have put this notion into question and shown that the
scattering in the far-field regime probes spatio-temporal density-density
correlations. Here, we propose a possible way to image the instantaneous
electron density of the wavepacket via ultrafast x-ray {\em phase contrast
imaging}. Moreover, we show that inelastic scattering processes, which plague
ultrafast scattering in the far-field regime, do not contribute in ultrafast
x-ray phase contrast imaging as a consequence of an interference effect. We
illustrate our general findings by means of a wavepacket that lies in the time
and energy range of the dynamics of valence electrons in complex molecular and
biological systems. This present work offers a potential to image not only
instantaneous snapshots of non-stationary electron dynamics, but also the

producing reactions C13(alpha,n)O16 and Ne22(alpha,n)Mg25. We vary the mass
width of a partially mixed zone (PMZ), which is responsible for the formation

PMZ masses from zero up to an extreme upper limit of the entire He-intershell

to the partially mixed zone have almost no effect on surface sulphur abundances

successful collaborative software engineering projects. Triaging bugs can

paper, we propose an efficient and practical method to identify valid bug
reports which a) refer to an actual software bug, b) are not duplicates and c)
contain enough information to be processed right away. Our classification is
based on nine measures to quantify the social embeddedness of bug reporters in
the collaboration network. We demonstrate its applicability in a case study,
using a comprehensive data set of more than 700,000 bug reports obtained from
the Bugzilla installation of four major OSS communities, for a period of more
than ten years. For those projects that exhibit the lowest fraction of valid
bug reports, we find that the bug reporters' position in the collaboration
network is a strong indicator for the quality of bug reports. Based on this
finding, we develop an automated classification scheme that can easily be
integrated into bug tracking platforms and analyze its performance in the
considered OSS communities. A support vector machine (SVM) to identify valid
bug reports based on the nine measures yields a precision of up to 90.3% with
an associated recall of 38.9%. With this, we significantly improve the results
obtained in previous case studies for an automated early identification of bugs
that are eventually fixed. Furthermore, our study highlights the potential of
using quantitative measures of social organization in collaborative software
engineering. It also opens a broad perspective for the integration of social
awareness in the design of support infrastructures.

link and network data analysis. The central idea is to assign a probability
distribution on the set of all paths in a network. More precisely, a
Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution is defined over a bag of paths in a network, that
is, on a representation that considers all paths independently. We show that,
under this distribution, the probability of drawing a path connecting two nodes
can easily be computed in closed form by simple matrix inversion. This
probability captures a notion of relatedness between nodes of the graph: two
nodes are considered as highly related when they are connected by many,
preferably low-cost, paths. As an application, two families of distances
between nodes are derived from the BoP probabilities. Interestingly, the second
distance family interpolates between the shortest path distance and the
resistance distance. In addition, it extends the Bellman-Ford formula for
computing the shortest path distance in order to integrate sub-optimal paths by
simply replacing the minimum operator by the soft minimum operator.
Experimental results on semi-supervised classification show that both of the
new distance families are competitive with other state-of-the-art approaches.
In addition to the distance measures studied in this paper, the bag-of-paths
framework enables straightforward computation of many other relevant network
measures.

between independently arising beneficial mutations in different individuals,
which is known as clonal interference. Fisher and Muller proposed that
recombination provides an evolutionary advantage in large populations by
alleviating this competition. Based on recent progress in quantifying the speed
of adaptation in asexual populations undergoing clonal interference, we present
a detailed analysis of the Fisher-Muller mechanism for a model genome
consisting of two loci with an infinite number of beneficial alleles each and
multiplicative fitness effects. We solve the infinite population dynamics
exactly and show that, for a particular, natural mutation scheme, the speed of
adaptation in sexuals is twice as large as in asexuals. Guided by the infinite
population result and by previous work on asexual adaptation, we postulate an
expression for the speed of adaptation in finite sexual populations that agrees
with numerical simulations over a wide range of population sizes and
recombination rates. The ratio of the sexual to asexual adaptation speed is a
function of population size that increases in the clonal interference regime
and approaches 2 for extremely large populations. The simulations also show
that the imbalance between the numbers of accumulated mutations at the two loci
is strongly suppressed even by a small amount of recombination. The
generalization of the model to an arbitrary number $L$ of loci is briefly
discussed. If each offspring samples the alleles at each locus from the gene
pool of the whole population rather than from two parents, the ratio of the
sexual to asexual adaptation speed is approximately equal to $L$ in large
populations. A possible realization of this scenario is the reassortment of
genetic material in RNA viruses with $L$ genomic segments.

$a=2\sqrt{2}G_F N_e E$, where $N_e$ is the electron density in matter and $E$

$\theta_{13}$, as discovered by the reactor experiments, the running of the

neglected. It simplifies the analysis of the resulting expressions for the
oscillation probabilities considerably. Approaches which attempt to directly
provide approximate analytical expressions for the oscillation probabilities in
matter suffer in accuracy due to their reliance on expansion in $\theta_{13}$,
or in simplicity when higher order terms in $\theta_{13}$ are included. We
demonstrate the accuracy of our method by comparing it to the exact numerical
result, as well as the direct approximations of Cervera et al., Akhmedov et

its earliest stages. Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs) are cold, dense and massive
enough to harbour the sites of future high-mass star formation. But up to now,
mainly small samples have been observed and analysed. To understand the
physical conditions during the early stages of high-mass star formation, it is
necessary to learn more about the physical conditions and stability in
relatively unevolved IRDCs. Thus, for characterising IRDCs studies of large
samples are needed. We investigate a complete sample of 218 northern hemisphere
high-contrast IRDCs using the ammonia (1,1)- and (2,2)-inversion transitions.
We detected ammonia (1,1)-inversion transition lines in 109 of our IRDC
candidates. Using the data we were able to study the physical conditions within
the star-forming regions statistically. We compared them with the conditions in
more evolved regions which have been observed in the same fashion as our sample
sources. Our results show that IRDCs have, on average, rotation temperatures of
15 K, are turbulent (with line width FWHMs around 2 km s$^{-1}$), have ammonia
column densities on the order of $10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ and molecular hydrogen
column densities on the order of $10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. Their virial masses are
between 100 and a few 1000 M$_\odot$. The comparison of bulk kinetic and
potential energies indicate that the sources are close to virial equilibrium.
IRDCs are on average cooler and less turbulent than a comparison sample of
high-mass protostellar objects, and have lower ammonia column densities. Virial
parameters indicate that the majority of IRDCs are currently stable, but are
expected to collapse in the future.

two primitives to probabilistic causal networks: controllable variables and
persistent variables. Controllable variables allow the representation of
actions as directly setting the value of specific events in the domain, subject
to preconditions. Persistent variables provide a canonical model of persistence
according to which both the state of a variable and the causal mechanism
dictating its value persist over time unless intervened upon by an action (or
its consequences). Action networks also allow different methods for quantifying
the uncertainty in causal relationships, which go beyond traditional
probabilistic quantification. This paper describes both recent results and work

Both kappa rankings and infinitesimal probabilities have been used extensively

conditional belief nets (CBNs) to capture the probabilistic dependency of the

explore either explicitly or implicitly asymmetries among probabilities of

small number of probable states, no formal justification has been proposed of
why this should be the case. This paper attempts to fill this apparent gap by
studying asymmetries among probabilities of various states of uncertain models.
By rewriting the joint probability distribution over a model's variables into a
product of individual variables' prior and conditional probability
distributions, and applying central limit theorem to this product, we can
demonstrate that the probabilities of individual states of the model can be
expected to be drawn from highly skewed, log-normal distributions. With
sufficient asymmetry in individual prior and conditional probability
distributions, a small fraction of states can be expected to cover a large

a possibility degree or a necessity degree that expresses to what extent the
formula is possibly or necessarily true. Possibilistic resolution yields a
calculus for possibilistic logic which respects the semantics developed for

originally proposed as abductive explanations. IB assignments assign fewer

evidentially supported variables. We use IB assignments to approximate marginal
probabilities in Bayesian belief networks. Recent work in belief updating for
Bayes networks attempts to approximate posterior probabilities by finding a
small number of the highest probability complete (or perhaps evidentially
supported) assignments. Under certain assumptions, the probability mass in the
union of these assignments is sufficient to obtain a good approximation. Such
methods are especially useful for highly-connected networks, where the maximum
clique size or the cutset size make the standard algorithms intractable. Since
IB assignments contain fewer assigned variables, the probability mass in each
assignment is greater than in the respective complete assignment. Thus, fewer
IB assignments are sufficient, and a good approximation can be obtained more
efficiently. IB assignments can be used for efficiently approximating posterior
node probabilities even in cases which do not obey the rather strict skewness
assumptions used in previous research. Two algorithms for finding the high
probability IB assignments are suggested: one by doing a best-first heuristic
search, and another by special-purpose integer linear programming. Experimental

distributions are used for representing beliefs. Models which rely on single
probability distributions depict a complete ordering among the propositions of
interest, yet human beliefs are sometimes not completely ordered. Non-singleton
sets of probability distributions can represent partially ordered beliefs.
Convex sets are particularly convenient and expressive, but it is known that
there are reasonable patterns of belief whose faithful representation require
less restrictive sets. The present paper shows that prior ignorance about three
or more exclusive alternatives and the emergence of partially ordered beliefs
when evidence is obtained defy representation by any single set of
distributions, but yield to a representation baud on several uts. The partial
order is shown to be a partial qualitative probability which shares some
intuitively appealing attributes with probability distributions.

Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) from some lines of sight. From a
magnetohydrodynamical framework, the torus can be considered to be a particular
region of clouds surrounding the central engine where the clouds are dusty and
optically thick. In this framework, the magnetic field plays an important role
in the creation, morphology and evolution of the torus. If the dust grains
within the clouds are assumed to be aligned by paramagnetic alignment, then the
ratio of the intrinsic polarisation and visual extinction, P(%)/Av, is a
function of the magnetic field strength.
  To estimate the visual extinction through the torus and constrain the
polarisation mechanisms in the nucleus of AGN, we developed a polarisation
model to fit both the total and polarised flux in a 1.2"" (~263pc) aperture of
the type 2 AGN, IC5063. The polarisation model is consistent with the nuclear
polarisation observed at K being produced by dichroic absorption from aligned
dust grains with a visual extinction through the torus of 48$\pm$2 mag. We
estimated the intrinsic polarisation arising from dichroic absorption to be
P$_{K}^{dic}$=12.5$\pm$2.7%.
  We consider the physical conditions and environment of the gas and dust for
the torus of IC5063. Then, through paramagnetic alignment, we estimate a
magnetic field strength in the range of 12-128mG in the NIR emitting regions of
the torus of IC5063. Alternatively, we estimate the magnetic field strength in
the plane of the sky using the Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. The minimum magnetic
field strength in the plane of the sky is estimated to be 13 and 41 mG
depending of the conditions within the torus of IC5063. These techniques afford
the chance to make a survey of AGN, to investigate the effects of magnetic

that from the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation in the chiral limit. Thus our
data for the Nf=8 QCD are consistent with the spontaneously broken chiral
symmetry. Remarkably enough, while the Nf=8 data near the chiral limit are well
described by the ChPT, those for the relatively large fermion bare mass m_f
away from the chiral limit actually exhibit a finite-size hyperscaling
relation, suggesting a large anomalous dimension gamma_m ~ 1. This implies that
there exists a remnant of the infrared conformality, and suggests that a

resultant stiffness matrix and the Jacobi preconditioned stiffness matrix is
investigated using a density function approach proposed by Fried in 1973. It is
shown that the approach can be made mathematically rigorous for general domains
and used to develop bounds on the smallest eigenvalue and the condition number
that are sharper than existing estimates in one and two dimensions and
comparable in three and higher dimensions. The new results reveal that the mesh
concentration near the boundary has less influence on the condition number than
the mesh concentration in the interior of the domain. This is especially true
for the Jacobi preconditioned system where the former has little or almost no
influence on the condition number. Numerical examples are presented.

covariant spectator quark model, and predict the transition magnetic dipole
form factors for those involving the strange baryons. Utilizing SU(3) symmetry,
the valence quark contributions are supplemented by the pion cloud dressing
based on the one estimated in the $\gamma^\ast N \to \Delta$ reaction. Although
the valence quark contributions are dominant in general, the pion cloud effects
turn out to be very important to describe the experimental data. We also show
that, other mesons besides the pion in particular the kaon, may be relevant for
some reactions such as $\gamma^\ast \Sigma^+ \to \Sigma^{*+}$, based on our
analysis for the radiative decay widths of the strange decuplet baryons.

modify, and debug. Traditional tactic languages, often based on stack-based
goal propagation, make it easy to write proofs that obscure the flow of goals
between tactics and are fragile to minor changes in input, proof structure or
changes to tactics themselves. Here, we address this by introducing a graphical
language called PSGraph for writing proof strategies. Strategies are
constructed visually by ""wiring together"" collections of tactics and evaluated
by propagating goal nodes through the diagram via graph rewriting. Tactic nodes
can have many output wires, and use a filtering procedure based on goal-types
(predicates describing the features of a goal) to decide where best to send
newly-generated sub-goals.
  In addition to making the flow of goal information explicit, the graphical
language can fulfil the role of many tacticals using visual idioms like
branching, merging, and feedback loops. We argue that this language enables
development of more robust proof strategies and provide several examples, along
with a prototype implementation in Isabelle.

spin-charge stripes have not been observed yet. In Raman scattering if we set,
for example, incident and scattered light polarizations to two possible stripe
directions, we can observe the fluctuating stripe as if it is static. Using the
different symmetry selection rule between the B1g two-magnon scattering and the
B1g and B2g isotropic electronic scattering, we succeeded to obtain the
k\parallel and k\perp strip magnetic excitations separately in La2-xSrxCuO4.
Only the k\perp stripe excitations appear in the wide-energy isotropic
electronic Raman scattering, indicating that the charge transfer is restricted
to the direction perpendicular to the stripe. This is the same as the Burgers
vector of an edge dislocation which easily slides perpendicularly to the
stripe. Hence charges at the edge dislocation move together with the
dislocation perpendicularly to the stripe, while other charges are localized. A
looped edge dislocation has lower energy than a single edge dislocation. The
superconducting coherence length is close to the inter-charge stripe distance
at x \le 0.2. Therefore we conclude that Cooper pairs are formed at looped edge
dislocations. The restricted charge transfer direction naturally explains the
opening of a pseudogap around (0, {\pi}) for the stripe parallel to the b axis
and the reconstruction of the Fermi surface to have a flat plane near (0,
{\pi}). They break the four-fold rotational symmetry. Furthermore the
systematic experiments revealed the carrier density dependence of the isotropic
and anisotropic electronic excitations, the spin density wave and/or charge
density wave gap near ({\pi}/2, {\pi}/2), and the strong coupling between the
electronic states near ({\pi}/2, {\pi}/2) and the zone boundary phonons at
({\pi}, {\pi}).

genetic and environmental factors but remains poorly understood. We studied the
effect of genetic polymorphisms on transgenerational inheritance of yeast
segregants that were derived from a cross between a laboratory strain and a
wild strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For each SNP analyzed, the parental
allele present in less than half of the segregants panel was called the minor
allele (MA). We found a nonrandom distribution of MAs in the segregants,
indicating natural selection. We compared segregants with high MA content (MAC)
relative to those with less and found a more dramatic shortening of the lag
phase length for the high MAC group in response to 14 days of ethanol training.
Also, the short lag phase as acquired and epigenetically memorized by ethanol
training was more dramatically lost after 7 days of recovery in ethanol free
medium for the high MAC group. Sodium chloride treatment produced similar
observations. Using public datasets, we found MAC linkage to mRNA expression of
hundreds of genes. Finally, we found preferential effect of MAC on traits with
high number of known additive quantitative trait loci (QTLs). These results
provide evidence for the slightly deleterious nature of most MAs and a lower
capacity to maintain inheritance of traits in individuals or cells with greater
MAC, which have implications for disease prevention and treatment and the
""missing heritability"" problem in complex traits and diseases.

Submitted to PLOS One",,,,"physics.hist-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Indus Civilization, often denoted by its major city Harappa, spanned
almost two millennia from 3200 to 1300 BC. Its tradition reaches back to 7000
BC: a 5000 year long expansion of villages and towns, of trading activity, and
of technological advancements culminates between 2600 and 1900 BC in the
build-up of large cities, writing, and political authority; it emerges as one
of the first great civilizations in history. During the ensuing 600 years,
however, key technologies fall out of use, urban centers are depopulated, and
people emigrate from former core settlement areas. Although many different
hypotheses have been put forward to explain this deurbanization, a conclusive
causal chain has not yet been established. We here combine literature estimates
on brick typology, and on urban area for individual cities. In the context of
the existing extensive data on Harappan artifact find sites and put in their
chronological context, the combined narratives told by bricks, cities, and
spatial extent can provide a new point of departure for discussing the possible
reasons for the mysterious ""decline"".

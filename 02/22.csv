the cluster-perturbation theory. The cluster approach is adapted to studies of
two-dimensional lattice systems by using concepts of multiple-scattering theory
and a component decomposition of the non-equilibrium Green's function on the
Keldysh-Matsubara contour. We consider ""classical"" initial states formed as
tensor products of states on 2x2-plaquettes and trace the effects of the
inter-plaquette hopping in the final-state dynamics. Two different initially
excited states are considered on an individual plaquette, a fully polarized
staggered spin state (N\'eel) and a fully polarized charge-density wave (CDW).
The final-state dynamics is constrained by a dynamical symmetry, i.e. the
time-evolution operator and certain observables are invariant under an
anti-unitary transformation composed of time reversal, an asymmetric
particle-hole, and a staggered sign transformation. We find an interesting
interrelation between this dynamical symmetry and the separation of energy and
time scales: In case of a global excitation with all plaquettes excited, the
initial N\'eel and the initial CDW states are linked by the transformation.
This prevents an efficient relaxation of the CDW state on the short time scale
governing the dynamics of charge degrees of freedom. Contrary, the CDW state is
found to relax much faster than the N\'eel state in case of a local excitation
on a single plaquette where the symmetry relation between the two states is
broken by the coupling to the environment.

as one of the major questions in the frontiers of particle astrophysics. Gamma
ray bursts (GRB), the most violent explosions in the universe second only to
the Big Bang, have been a popular candidate site for UHECR productions. The
recent IceCube report on the non-observation of GRB induced neutrinos therefore
attracts wide attention. This dilemma requires a resolution: either the
assumption of GRB as UHECR accelerator is to be abandoned or the expected GRB
induced neutrino yield was wrong. It has been pointed out that IceCube has
overestimated the neutrino flux at GRB site by a factor of $\sim 5$. In this
paper we point out that, in addition to the issue of neutrino production at
source, the neutrino oscillation and the possible neutrino decay during their
flight from GRB to Earth should further reduce the detectability of IceCube,
which is most sensitive to the muon-neutrino flavor as far as point-source
identification is concerned. Specifically, neutrino oscillation will reduce the
muon-neutrino flavor ratio from 2/3 per neutrino at GRB source to 1/3 on Earth,
while neutrino decay, if exists and under the assumption of normal hierarchy of
mass eigenstates, would result in a further reduction of muon-neutrino ratio to
1/8. With these in mind, we note that there have been efforts in recent years
in pursuing other type of neutrino telescopes based on Askaryan effect, which
can in principle observe and distinguish all three flavors with comparable
sensitivities. Such new approach may therefore be complementary to IceCube in
shedding more lights on this cosmic accelerator question.

particular, under a condition on the mean curvature vector we show a critical
point minimizes the quasi-local energy locally. The same condition also implies
that the critical point is globally minimizing among all axially symmetric
embedding provided the image of the associated isometric embedding lies in a
totally geodesic Euclidean 3-space.

filtering problem can be solved exactly. In practice, the solution contains
terms that are computationally intractible. Assumed density filtering methods
attempt to match statistics of the filtering distribution to some set of more
tractible probability distributions. We describe a novel method that decomposes
the Brownian motion driving the signal in a generalised Fourier series, which
is truncated after a number of terms. This approximation to Brownian can be
described using a relatively small number of Fourier coefficients, and allows
us to compute statistics of the filtering distribution with a single
application of a sigma-point method. Assumed density filters that exist in the
literature usually rely on discretisation of the signal dynamics followed by
iterated application of a sigma point transform (or a limiting case thereof).
Iterating the transform in this manner can lead to loss of information about
the filtering distri- bution in highly nonlinear settings. We demonstrate that
our method is better equipped to cope with such problems.

strategies allow to cope with well-known problems associated with standard
portfolio insurance methods, like e.g. the CPPI cash lock-in. This is
especially an issue in times of market crisis. However, the minimum guaranteed

of the two strategies, various criteria are applied such as comparison of

and monitoring gene expression responses, are powerful tools for studying
cellular signal transduction pathways. However, it remains a challenge to
automatically derive knowledge of a cellular signaling system at a conceptual
level from systematic perturbation-response data. In this study, we explored a
framework that unifies knowledge mining and data mining approaches towards the
goal. The framework consists of the following automated processes: 1) applying
an ontology-driven knowledge mining approach to identify functional modules
among the genes responding to a perturbation in order to reveal potential
signals affected by the perturbation; 2) applying a graph-based data mining
approach to search for perturbations that affect a common signal with respect
to a functional module, and 3) revealing the architecture of a signaling system
organize signaling units into a hierarchy based on their relationships.
Applying this framework to a compendium of yeast perturbation-response data, we
have successfully recovered many well-known signal transduction pathways; in
addition, our analysis have led to many hypotheses regarding the yeast signal
transduction system; finally, our analysis automatically organized perturbed
genes as a graph reflecting the architect of the yeast signaling system.
Importantly, this framework transformed molecular findings from a gene level to
a conceptual level, which readily can be translated into computable knowledge
in the form of rules regarding the yeast signaling system, such as ""if genes
involved in MAPK signaling are perturbed, genes involved in pheromone responses
will be differentially expressed"".

that map pairs of instances to a logical indicator. This problem has
application in numerous areas of machine learning, such as ranking, entity
resolution and link prediction. Our learning framework incorporates an example
labeler that, given a sequence $X$ of $n$ instances and a desired training size
$m$, subsamples $m$ pairs from $X \times X$ without replacement. The challenge
in analyzing this learning scenario is that pairwise combinations of random
variables are inherently dependent, which prevents us from using traditional
learning-theoretic arguments. We present a unified, graph-based analysis, which
allows us to analyze this dependence using well-known graph identities. We are
then able to bound the generalization error of learned binary relations using
Rademacher complexity and algorithmic stability. The rate of uniform
convergence is partially determined by the labeler's subsampling process. We
thus examine how various assumptions about subsampling affect generalization;
under a natural random subsampling process, our bounds guarantee
$\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{n})$ uniform convergence.

indegree(v).
  This result also has an application to the problem of testing whether a given

problem in property testing and statistics. If the distribution is the
stationary distribution of the lazy random walk on a directed graph and the
graph is given as an input, then how many bits of the input graph do one need
to query in order to decide whether the distribution is uniform or ""far"" from
it? This is a problem of graph property testing and we consider this problem in
the orientation model (introduced by Halevy et al.). We reduce this problem to
test (in the orientation model) whether a directed graph is Eulerian. And using
result of Fischer et al. on query complexity of testing (in the orientation
model) whether a graph is Eulerian, we obtain bounds on the query complexity
for testing whether the stationary distribution is uniform.

gravitational instability models and planet population synthesis models

any new substellar companion. The survey's median detection performance reaches
contrasts of 10 mag at 0.5as and 11.5 mag at 1as. We find the occurrence of
planets to be between 10.8-24.8 % at 68 % confidence level assuming a uniform

show that this mechanism favors the formation of rather massive clump (Mclump >

orbital parameters of already catalogued objects. Using NEODyS we compute the
position and magnitude of these objects at the observing epochs of the 938 046
images comprising the Eigth Data Release of the Sloan Digitised Sky Survey
(SDSS). If the object lies within the image boundaries and the magnitude is
brighter than the limiting magnitude, then the associated image is visually
inspected by the project's collaborators (the citizens) to confirm or discard
the presence of the NEA. If confirmed, accurate coordinates and, sometimes,
magnitudes are submitted to the MPC. Using this methodology, 3,226 registered
users have made during the first fifteen months of the project more than
167,000 measurements which have improved the orbital elements of 551 NEAs (6%
of the total number of this type of asteroids). Even more remarkable is the
fact that these results have been obtained at zero cost to telescope time as
NEAs were serendipitously observed while the survey was being carried out. This
demonstrates the enormous scientific potential hidden in astronomical archives.
  The great reception of the project as well as the results obtained makes it a

state information (CSI) among K spatially distributed transmitters (TXs)
jointly cooperating to serve K receivers (RXs). One of the particularities of
this work lies in the fact that the CSI is distributed in the sense that each
TX obtains its own estimate of the global multi-user MIMO channel with no
further exchange of information being allowed between the TXs. Although this is
well suited to model the cooperation between non-colocated TXs, e.g., in
cellular Coordinated Multipoint (CoMP) schemes, this type of setting has
received little attention so far in the information theoretic society. We study
in this work what are the CSI requirements at every TX, as a function of the
network geometry, to ensure that the maximal number of degrees-of-freedom (DoF)
is achieved, i.e., the same DoF as obtained under perfect CSI at all TXs. We
advocate the use of the generalized DoF to take into account the geometry of
the network in the analysis. Consistent with the intuition, the derived DoF
maximizing CSI allocation policy suggests that TX cooperation should be limited
to a specific finite neighborhood around each TX. This is in sharp contrast
with the conventional (uniform) CSI dissemination policy which induces CSI
requirements that grow unbounded with the network size. The proposed CSI
allocation policy suggests an alternative to clustering which overcomes
fundamental limitations such as (i) edge interference and (ii) unbounded
increase of the CSIT requirements with the cluster size. Finally, we show how
finite neighborhood CSIT exchange translates into finite neighborhood message
exchange so that finally global interference management is possible with only
local cooperation

malleable, transparent, conducting films, with the technologically promising
application of being used as flexible electronic displays. Nanotubes disorderly
distributed in a film offers many possible paths for charge carriers to travel
across the entire system, but the theoretical description of how this charge
transport occurs is rather challenging for involving a combination of intrinsic
nanotube properties with network morphology aspects. Here we attempt to
describe the transport properties of such films in two different length scales.
Firstly, from a purely macroscopic point of view we carry out a geometrical
analysis that shows how the network connectivity depends on the nanotube
concentration and on their respective aspect ratio. Once this is done, we are
able to calculate the resistivity of a heavily disordered networked film.
Comparison with experiment offers us a way to infer about the junction
resistance between neighbouring nanotubes. Furthermore, in order to guide the
frantic search for high-conductivity films of nanotube networks, we turn to the
microscopic scale where we have developed a computationally efficient way for
calculating the ballistic transport across these networks. While the ballistic
transport is probably not capable of describing the observed transport
properties of these films, it is undoubtedly useful in establishing an upper
value for their conductivity. This can serve as a guideline in how much room
there is for improving the conductivity of such networks.

fading channel dominates another in the ergodic capacity ordering sense, if the
Shannon transform of the first is greater than that of the second at all values
of average signal to noise ratio. It is shown that some parametric fading
models such as the Nakagami-m, Rician, and Hoyt are distributions that are
monotonic in their line of sight parameters with respect to the ergodic
capacity order. Some operations under which the ergodic capacity order is
preserved are also discussed. Through these properties of the ergodic capacity
order, it is possible to compare under two different fading scenarios, the
ergodic capacity of a composite system involving multiple fading links with
coding/decoding capabilities only at the transmitter/receiver. Such comparisons
can be made even in cases when a closed form expression for the ergodic
capacity of the composite system is not analytically tractable. Applications to
multiple access channels, and extensions to multiple-input multiple-output

vertex, the surviving part $T'$ of $T$ still contains a BFS spanning tree for
(the surviving part of) $G$. Our main results are as follows. We present an

consider {\em fault-tolerant multi-source BFS trees}, or {\em FT-MBFS trees}

are provided, showing that there exists a poly-time algorithm that for every

$n$-vertex graphs with source sets $S \subseteq V$ of cardinality $\sigma$, on
which any FT-MBFS tree from $S$ has $\Omega(\sqrt{\sigma}\cdot n^{3/2})$ edges.
Finally, we propose an $O(\log n)$ approximation algorithm for constructing
FT-BFS and FT-MBFS structures. The latter is complemented by a hardness result
stating that there exists no $\Omega(\log n)$ approximation algorithm for these
problems under standard complexity assumptions.

waves in a polar coronal hole. Alfv\'en waves have been proposed as the energy
source that heats the corona and drives the solar wind. Previous work has shown
that line widths decrease with height in coronal holes, which is a signature of
wave damping, but have been unable to quantify the energy lost by the waves.
This is because line widths depend on both the non-thermal velocity v_nt and
the ion temperature T_i. We have implemented a means to separate the T_i and
v_nt contributions using the observation that at low heights the waves are
undamped and the ion temperatures do not change with height. This enables us to
determine the amount of energy carried by the waves at low heights, which is
proportional to v_nt. We find the initial energy flux density present was 6.7
+/- 0.7 x 10^5 erg cm^-2 s^-1, which is sufficient to heat the coronal hole and
acccelerate the solar wind during the 2007 - 2009 solar minimum. Additionally,
we find that about 85% of this energy is dissipated below 1.5 R_sun,
sufficiently low that thermal conduction can transport the energy throughout
the coronal hole, heating it and driving the fast solar wind. The remaining
energy is roughly consistent with what models show is needed to provide the
extended heating above the sonic point for the fast solar wind. We have also

crucial means to achieve a top-quality offer and, equally important, to enforce

research community are a good starting point to address this shortcoming, but
miss elements that would enable their applicability in an ISP's network.
  We extend pathlet routing by introducing a new control plane for internal
routing that has the following qualities: it is designed to operate in the
internal network of an ISP; it enables fine-grained management of network paths
with suitable configuration primitives; it is scalable because routing changes
are only propagated to the network portion that is affected by the changes; it
supports independent configuration of specific network portions without the
need to know the configuration of the whole network; it is robust thanks to the
adoption of multipath routing; it supports the enforcement of QoS levels; it is
independent of the specific data plane used in the ISP's network; it can be
incrementally deployed and it can nicely coexist with other control planes.
Besides formally introducing the algorithms and messages of our control plane,
we propose an experimental validation in the simulation framework OMNeT++ that
we use to assess the effectiveness and scalability of our approach.

theoretically challenging, with numerous approaches having been published in
the literature. We present a study of five distinct approaches to modelling AGN
feedback within gravitohydrodynamic simulations of major mergers of Milky
Way-sized galaxies. To constrain differences to only be between AGN feedback
models, all simulations start from the same initial conditions and use the same
star formation algorithm. Most AGN feedback algorithms have five key aspects:
black hole accretion rate, energy feedback rate and method, particle accretion
algorithm, black hole advection algorithm, and black hole merger algorithm. All
models follow different accretion histories, with accretion rates that differ
by up to three orders of magnitude at any given time. We consider models with
either thermal or kinetic feedback, with the associated energy deposited
locally around the black hole. Each feedback algorithm modifies the gas
properties near the black hole to different extents. The particle accretion
algorithms usually (but not always) maintain good agreement between the mass
accreted by \dot{M} dt and the mass of gas particles removed from the
simulation. The black hole advection algorithms dampen inappropriate dragging
of the black holes by two-body interactions. Advecting the black hole a limited
distance based upon local mass distributions has many desirably properties. The
black holes merge when given criteria are met, and we find a range of merger
times for different criteria. Using the M_{BH}-\sigma relation as a diagnostic
of the remnants yields three models that lie within the one-sigma scatter of
the observed relation and two that fall below it. The wide variation in
accretion behaviours of the models reinforces the fact that there remains much
to be learnt about the evolution of galactic nuclei. (abridged)

which is similar to that seen in blue optical bands. The supernova brightness
fades at 0.78+/-0.02 mag/100d in the 4.5 micron channel which is close to that
observed in the near-IR. We argue that the difference is a result of doubly
ionized iron-peak elements dominating the bluer IRAC band while singly ionized
species are controlling the longer wavelength channel. To test this, we use
Large Binocular Telescope spectra taken during the same phases to show that
doubly ionized emission lines do fade more slowly than their singly ionized
cousins. We also find that [Co III] emission fades at more than twice the
radioactive decay rate due to the combination of decreasing excitation in the
nebula, recombination and cobalt decaying to iron. The nebular emission
velocities of [Fe III] and [Co III] lines show a smaller blue-shift than
emission from singly ionized atoms. The Si II velocity gradient near maximum
light combined with our nebular velocity measurements suggest SN 2011fe was a
typical member of the `low velocity gradient' class of type Ia. Analyzing IRAC
photometry from other supernovae we find that mid-IR color of type Ia events is
correlated with the early light curve width and can be used as an indicator of

were performed on the William Herschel Telescope using ULTRACAM. Lightcurves
for both systems have been obtained with the SDSS filters $u'$, $g'$ and $r'$
simultaneously with cadences between $\approx0.5-2$ seconds, and allow us to
probe temporal frequencies between ~10^{-3} Hz and ~1 Hz. We find high levels
of coherence between the u', g' and r' lightcurves up to at least ~10^{-2} Hz.
Furthermore we detect red/negative lags where the redder bands lag the bluer
ones at the lowest observed frequencies. For MV Lyr time lags up to ~3 seconds
are observed, whilst LU Cam displays larger time lags of ~10 seconds.
Mechanisms which seek to explain red/negative lags observed in X-ray binaries
and Active Galactic Nuclei involve reflection of photons generated close to the
compact object onto the surface layers of the accretion disk, where the lag
delay is simply the light-travel time from the emitting source to the
reflecting accretion disk area. Although this could be a viable explanation for
the lags observed in MV Lyr, the lags observed in LU Cam are too large to be
explained by reflection from the disk and/or the donor star. We suggest
reprocessing on the thermal timescale of boundary layer photons onto the
accretion disk as a possible mechanism to explain the lags observed in
accreting white dwarfs, or reverse (inside-out) shocks within the disk
travelling through cooler disk regions as they move outwards.

N(H I) in the strongest H I component of each absorber. We find that the

metal-poor and metal-rich branches peaking at [X/H]=-1.6 and -0.3 (or about
2.5% and 50% solar metallicities). The cool CGM probed by these LLS is
predominantly ionized. The metal-rich branch of the population likely traces
winds, recycled outflows, and tidally stripped gas; the metal-poor branch has
properties consistent with cold accretion streams thought to be a major source
of fresh gas for star forming galaxies. Both branches have a nearly equal

exhibit a continuous transition from the paramagnetic semimetal/metal to an

evidence for spectral flattening, which is characterised by alpha = 0.852 +/-

the Majorana fermion - the elusive quantum entity at the border between
particles and antiparticles - has produced the first positive experimental
results, but is not over yet. Originally proposed by E. Majorana in the context
of particle physics, Majorana fermions have a condensed matter analog in the
zero-energy bound states emerging in topological superconductors. A promising
route to engineering topological superconductors capable of hosting Majorana
zero modes consists of proximity coupling semiconductor thin films or nanowires
with strong spin-orbit interaction to conventional s-wave superconductors in
the presence of an external Zeeman field. The Majorana zero mode is predicted
to emerge above a certain critical Zeeman field as a zero-energy state
localized near the order parameter defects, viz., vortices for thin films and
wire-ends for the nanowire. These Majorana bound states are expected to
manifest non--Abelian quantum statistics, which makes them ideal building
blocks for fault--tolerant topological quantum computation. This review
provides an update on current status of the search for Majorana fermions in
semiconductor nanowires by focusing on the recent developments, in particular
the period following the first reports of experimental signatures consistent
with the realization of Majorana bound states in semiconductor
nanowire--superconductor hybrid structures. We start with a discussion of the
fundamental aspects of the subject, followed by considerations on the realistic
modeling which is a critical bridge between theoretical predictions based on
idealized conditions and the real world, as probed experimentally. The last
part is dedicated to a few intriguing issues that were brought to the fore by
the recent encouraging experimental advances.

emission lines from highly ionized Mn, Cr, and Ni as well as Fe. The observed
Mn-to-Cr line flux ratio is ~0.60, ~30% larger than that measured in Tycho's

suggestive of a large neutron excess in the progenitor star before the onset of
the thermonuclear runaway. The observed Ni-to-Fe line flux ratio (~0.03)
corresponds to a mass ratio of ~0.06, which is generally consistent with the
products of explosive Si-burning regime in Type Ia explosion models, and rules
out contamination from the products of neutron-rich nuclear statistical
equilibrium in the shocked ejecta. Together with the previously suggested
luminous nature of the explosion, these mass ratios provide strong evidence for
a super-solar metallicity in the SN progenitor (~3 Z_sun). Kepler's supernova
was likely the thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf formed in the recent
past that must have exploded through a relatively prompt channel.

With the typical experimental selection cuts, the VBF sample is contaminated by
a 25% fraction from Higgs + 2 jet production via gluon fusion (ggF) which has
large perturbative uncertainties. We perform a detailed study of the
perturbative uncertainties in the NLO predictions for pp -> H+2 jets via ggF
used by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations, with the VBF selection cuts of their
current H -> gamma gamma analyses. We discuss in detail the application of the
so-called ""ST method"" for estimating fixed-order perturbative uncertainties in
this case, and also consider generalizations of it. Qualitatively, our results
apply equally to other decay channels with similar VBF selection cuts. Typical
VBF selections include indirect restrictions or explicit vetoes on additional
jet activity, primarily to reduce non-Higgs backgrounds. We find that such
restrictions have to be chosen carefully and are not necessarily beneficial for
the purpose of distinguishing between the VBF and ggF production modes, since a
modest reduction in the relative ggF contamination can be easily overwhelmed by
its quickly increasing perturbative uncertainties.

with radius. Metallicity profiles have also been produced, but no evidence of

obtained for both systems are not always in good agreement with what is

them as and relaxed systems. However, the decrement of the temperature in
Abell267 could start at lower radii. Also the presence of a recent merger in

gamma rays, with two major flaring episodes (2009 July and 2010 March) and a
harder-when-brighter behaviour, quite common for FSRQs and
low-synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs, in 2010 March. In the same way the SED of the
source cannot be modelled by a simple synchrotron self-Compton model, as
opposed to many BL Lacs, but the addition of an external Compton component of
seed photons from a dust torus is needed. The 230 GHz light curve showed an
increase simultaneous with the gamma-ray one, indicating co-spatiality of the
mm and gamma-ray emission region likely at large distance from the central
engine. The low, average, and high activity SED of the source could be fit
changing only the electron distribution parameters, but two breaks in the
electron distribution are necessary. The ensuing extra spectral break, located
at NIR-optical frequencies, together with that in gamma rays seem to indicate a
common origin, most likely due to an intrinsic feature in the underlying
electron distribution. An overall correlation between the gamma-ray band with
the R-band and K-band has been observed with no significant time lag. On the
other hand, when inspecting the light curves on short time scales some
differences are evident. In particular, flaring activity has been detected in
NIR and optical bands with no evident gamma-ray counterparts in 2009 September
and November. Moderate variability has been observed in X-rays with no
correlation between flux and photon index. An increase of the detected X-ray
flux with no counter part at the other wavelengths has been observed in 2008
October, suggesting once more a complex correlation between the emission at
different energy bands.

can improve the constraints on some cosmological parameters far beyond the
limits imposed by a simplistic interpretation of cosmic variance. This
enhancement derives from comparing the relative clustering between different
tracers of large-scale structure. We present a simple but fully generic
expression for the Fisher information matrix of surveys with any (discrete)
number of tracers, and show that the enhancement of the constraints on
bias-sensitive parameters are a straightforward consequence of this
multi-tracer Fisher matrix. In fact, the relative clustering amplitudes between
tracers are eigenvectors of this multi-tracer Fisher matrix. The diagonalized
multi-tracer Fisher matrix clearly shows that while the effective volume is
bounded by the physical volume of the survey, the relational information
between species is unbounded. As an application, we study the expected
enhancements in the constraints of realistic surveys that aim at mapping
several different types of tracers of large-scale structure. The gain obtained
by combining multiple tracers is highest at low redshifts, and in one
particular scenario we analyzed, the enhancement can be as large as a factor of
~3 for the accuracy in the determination of the redshift distortion parameter,
and a factor ~5 for the local non-Gaussianity parameter. Radial and angular
distance determinations from the baryonic features in the power spectrum may
also benefit from the multi-tracer approach.

information is revealed about the problem instance in each stage, but the cost
of taking actions increases. The dilemma for the decision-maker is whether to
wait for additional information and risk the inflation, or to take early
actions to hedge against rising costs. We study the ""k-robust"" uncertainty
model: in each stage i = 0, 1,...,T, the algorithm is shown some subset of size
k_i that completely contains the eventual demands to be covered; here k_1 > k_2
>...> k_T which ensures increasing information over time. The goal is to
minimize the cost incurred in the worst-case possible sequence of revelations.
  For the multistage k-robust set cover problem, we give an O(log m + log
n)-approximation algorithm, nearly matching the \Omega(log n + log m/loglog m)
hardness of approximation even for T=2 stages. Moreover, our algorithm has a
useful ""thrifty"" property: it takes actions on just two stages. We show similar
thrifty algorithms for multi-stage k-robust Steiner tree, Steiner forest, and
minimum-cut. For these problems our approximation guarantees are O(min{T, log
n, log L_{max}), where L_{max} is the maximum inflation over all the stages. We
conjecture that these problems also admit O(1)-approximate thrifty algorithms.

collisions among phonons in superfluid neutron stars. We use effective field
theory techniques to extract the allowed phonon collisional processes, written
as a function of the equation of state of the system. The solution of the
dynamical evolution of the phonon number density allows us to calculate the
bulk viscosity coefficients as function of the phonon collisional rate and the
phonon dispersion law, which depends on the neutron pairing gap. Our method of
computation is rather general, and could be used for different superfluid
systems, provided they share the same underlying symmetries. We find that the
behavior with temperature of the bulk viscosity coefficients is dominated by
the contributions coming from the collinear regime of the $2\leftrightarrow3$
phonon processes. For typical star radial pulsation frequencies of $\omega \sim
10^{4} s^{-1}$, we obtain that the bulk viscosity coefficients at densities $n
\gtrsim 4n_0$ are within 10% from its static value for $T \lesssim 10^9 K$ and
for the case of strong neutron superfluidity in the core with a maximum value
of the $^3P_2$ gap above 1 MeV, while, otherwise, the static solution is not a
valid approximation to the bulk viscosity coefficients. Compared to previous
results from Urca and modified Urca reactions, we conclude that at $T\sim

controlling the optical phase of a p-polarized light wave that is guided
through a surface-patterned metallic structure with subwavelength features. For
dynamic control, field-induced transparency (FIT) from photo-excited electrons
in a slit-embedded atomic system show up within a narrow frequency window for
modulating the intensity of focused transmitted light in the near-field region.
Based on the electromagnetic coupling, this is facilitated by surface plasmons
between the two FIT-atom embedded slits. For static control, the role of
surface curvature is obtained for focused transmitted light passing through a
Gaussian-shaped metallic microlens embedded with a linear array of slits, in
addition to a negative light-refraction pattern, which is associated with
higher-diffraction modes of light, under a large angle of incidence in the
near-field region. Most interesting, however, this anomalous negative
light-refraction pattern becomes suppressible with leaked higher-order
waveguide modes of light passing through a very thin film. At the same time, it
is also suppressible with a reinforced reflection at the left foothill of a
Gaussian-shaped slit array for the forward-propagating surface-plasmon wave at
large angles of incidence. A prediction is given for near-field focusing of
light with its sharpness dynamically controlled by the frequency of the light
in a very narrow window. Moreover, a different scheme based on Green's second
integral identity is proposed for overcoming a difficulty in calculating the
near-field distribution very close to a surface by means of a
finite-difference-time-domain method.

revealed significantly large amounts of newly-condensed dust in their ejecta,
comparable to the total mass of available refractory elements. The dust masses
derived from these observations assume that all the grains of a given species
radiate at the same temperature, regardless of the dust heating mechanism or
grain radius. In this paper, we derive the dust mass in the ejecta of the Crab
Nebula, using a physical model for the heating and radiation from the dust. We
adopt a power-law distribution of grain sizes and two different dust
compositions (silicates and amorphous carbon), and calculate the heating rate
of each dust grain by the radiation from the pulsar wind nebula (PWN). We find
that the grains attain a continuous range of temperatures, depending on their
size and composition. The total mass derived from the best-fit models to the
observed IR spectrum is 0.019-0.13 solar masses, depending on the assumed grain
composition. We find that the power-law size distribution of dust grains is
characterized by a power-law index of 3.5-4.0 and a maximum grain size larger
than 0.1 microns. The grain sizes and composition are consistent with what is
expected for dust grains formed in a Type IIP SN. Our derived dust mass is at
least a factor of two less than the mass reported in previous studies of the
Crab Nebula that assumed more simplified two-temperature models. The results of
this study show that a physical model resulting in a realistic distribution of
dust temperatures can constrain the dust properties and affect the derived dust
masses. Our study may also have important implications for deriving grain
properties and mass estimates in other SNRs and for the ultimate question of
whether SNe are major sources of dust in the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM)
and in external galaxies.

as an energy injection mechanism, to the IGM in general, and to the medium
within particular DM haloes. We consider thermal relic WIMP particles with
masses of 10GeV and 1TeV and we analyse in detail the clustering properties of
DM in a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, on all hierarchy levels, from haloes and their
mass function, to subhaloes and the DM density profiles within them,
considering adiabatic contraction by the presence of a SMBH. We then compute
the corresponding energy output, concluding that DM annihilation does not
constitute an important feedback mechanism. We also calculate the effects that
DM annihilation has on the IGM temperature and ionization fraction, and we find
that assuming maximal energy absorption, at z ~ 10, for the case of a 1TeV
WIMP, the ionization fraction could be raised to $6 \times 10^{-4}$ and the
temperature to 10K, and in the case of a 10GeV WIMP, the IGM temperature could
be raised to 200K and the ionization fraction to $8 \times 10^{-3}$. We
conclude that DM annihilations cannot be regarded as an alternative
reionization scenario. Regarding the detectability of the WIMP through the
modifications to the 21 cm differential brightness temperature signal

likelihood procedure in a factor analysis model. Typically, the model
estimation is done under the assumption that the common factors are orthogonal
(uncorrelated). However, the lasso-type penalization method based on the
orthogonal model can often estimate a completely different model from that with
the true factor structure when the common factors are correlated. In order to
overcome this problem, we propose to incorporate a factor correlation into the
model, and estimate the factor correlation along with parameters included in
the orthogonal model by maximum penalized likelihood procedure. An entire
solution path is computed by the EM algorithm with coordinate descent, which
permits the application to a wide variety of convex and nonconvex penalties.
The proposed method can provide sufficiently sparse solutions, and be applied
to the data where the number of variables is larger than the number of
observations. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to investigate the
effectiveness of our modeling strategies. The results show that the lasso-type
penalization based on the orthogonal model cannot often approximate the true
factor structure, whereas our approach performs well in various situations. The
usefulness of the proposed procedure is also illustrated through the analysis

binaries and microquasars, with the emphasize on recent developments in the
high energy regime. The focus is put on understanding the accretion flows and
measuring the parameters of black holes in them. It includes mainly two parts:
(1) Brief review of several recent review article on this subject; (2) Further
development on several topics, including black hole spin measurements, hot
accretion flows, corona formation, state transitions and thermal stability of
standard think disk. This is thus not a regular bottom-up approach, which I
feel not necessary at this stage. Major effort is made in making and
incorporating from many sources useful plots and illustrations, in order to
make this article more comprehensible to non-expert readers. In the end I
attempt to make a unification scheme on the accretion-outflow (wind/jet)
connections of all types of accreting BHs of all accretion rates and all BH
mass scales, and finally provide a brief outlook.

The anisotropy of the speed of light may imply that the spacetime is
anisotropic. Finsler geometry is a reasonable candidate to deal with the
spacetime anisotropy. In this paper, the Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) of
the photon sector is investigated in the locally Minkowski spacetime. The
locally Minkowski spacetime is a class of flat Finsler spacetime and refers a
metric with the anisotropic departure from the Minkowski one. The LIV matrices
used to fit the experimental data are represented in terms of these metric
deviations. The GRAAL experiment constrains the spacetime anisotropy to be less
than \(10^{-14}\). In addition, we find that the simplest Finslerian photon
sector could be viewed as a geometric representation of the photon sector in
the minimal standard model extension (SME).

A web survey and a web content analysis were conducted as the methods to elicit
data on web accessibility. Factors preventing accessibility were hypothesized
as an initial experiment. Affecting design elements are identified through web
content analysis, the results of which are utilized to develop specific
implications for improving web accessibility. The hypothesis tests show that
there is no significant correlation between accessibility and geographical or
economic factors. However, physical impairments of users have a considerable
influence on the accessibility of web page user interface if it has been
designed without full consideration of the needs of all users. Especially,
visual and mobility impaired users experience poor accessibility. Poor
readability and less navigable page designs are two observable issues, which
pose threats to accessibility. The lack of conformance to W3C accessibility
guidelines and the poor design process are the specific shortcomings which
reduce the overall accessibility. Guidelines aim to improve the accessibility
of sites with a strategic focus. Further enhancements are suggested with
adherence to principles, user centered design and developing customizable web
portals compatible for connections with differing speeds. Re-ordering search
results has been suggested as one of the finest step towards making the web
content accessible for users with differing needs. A need for developing new
design models for differencing user groups and implementing web accessibility

dissemination via e-commerce websites in the developing countries.

linkage disequilibrium (LD) and potential interactions can further enhance the
discovery process, leading to the identification of new disease-susceptibility
genetic variants. Motivated by the recent development in spatial statistics, we
propose a new statistical model based on the random field theory, referred to
as a genetic random field model (GenRF), for joint association analysis with
the consideration of possible gene-gene interactions and LD. Using a
pseudo-likelihood approach, a GenRF test for the joint association of multiple
genetic variants is developed, which has the following advantages: 1.
considering complex interactions for improved performance; 2. natural dimension
reduction; 3. boosting power in the presence of LD; 4. computationally
efficient. Simulation studies are conducted under various scenarios. Compared
with a commonly adopted kernel machine approach, SKAT, GenRF shows overall
comparable performance and better performance in the presence of complex
interactions. The method is further illustrated by an application to the Dallas

phases of atomic Fermi gases of two-hyperfine states loaded in a deep optical
lattice. To make our theory applicable for both superconductivity and
superfluidity, we assume the more general $t-U-J$ Hamiltonian.
  Using the functional differentiation we derive Schwinger-Dyson equations for
the single-particle Green's functions.
  The method of Legendre transform is used to give a systematic derivation of
the Bethe-Salpeter (BS) equation for the two-particle Green's function and the
associated collective modes. The numerical solution of the BS equation in the
limit $J\rightarrow 0$ shows the existence of two rotonlike collective modes
with different low-energy Goldstone dispersions and different positions of the
rotonlike minima. The two rotonlike modes lie outside of the region determined
by the lower boundary of the particle-hole continuum, and therefore, the two
modes are not damped and they should be experimentally observable.
  In the presence of superfluid flow at a certain critical flow momentum, the
minimum of the first rotonlike mode reaches zero energy, but this occurs before
the minimum of the second mode and the lower boundary of the particle-hole
continuum do, i.e. there are two critical flow momenta related to the existence
of two rotonlike excitations.

the computational power of both CPU and GPU with optimized algorithms, delivers
high speed and sensitivity simultaneously. Compared with widely adopted
aligners including BWA, Bowtie2, SeqAlto, GEM and GPU-based aligners including
BarraCUDA and CUSHAW, SOAP3-dp is two to tens of times faster, while
maintaining the highest sensitivity and lowest false discovery rate (FDR) on
Illumina reads with different lengths. Transcending its predecessor SOAP3,
which does not allow gapped alignment, SOAP3-dp by default tolerates alignment
similarity as low as 60 percent. Real data evaluation using human genome
demonstrates SOAP3-dp's power to enable more authentic variants and longer
Indels to be discovered. Fosmid sequencing shows a 9.1 percent FDR on newly
discovered deletions. SOAP3-dp natively supports BAM file format and provides a
scoring scheme same as BWA, which enables it to be integrated into existing

bandpasses of two photometric instruments planned to be mounted to the JWST. We
analyze in which filters and for which scenarios molecular absorption bands are

Absorption bands of CO2, H2O, CH4 and O3 are clearly visible in high-resolution
spectra as well as in the filters of photometric instruments. However, only
during primary eclipse bands of CO2, H2O and O3 are detectable for all
scenarios when using photometric instruments and an E-ELT telescope setup. CH4
is only detectable at the outer HZ of the K star since here the atmospheric
modeling results in very high abundances. Since the detectable CO2 and H2O
bands overlap, separate bands need to be observed to prove their existence in
the atmosphere. In order to detect H2O in a separate band, a S/N>7 needs to be
achieved for E-ELT observations, e.g. by co-adding at least 10 transit
observations. Using a spaceborne telescope like the JWST enables the detection
of CO2 at 4.3mu, which is not possible for ground-based observations due to the
Earth's atmospheric absorption. Hence combining observations of spaceborne and
groundbased telescopes might allow to detect the presence of the biomarker
molecule O3 and the related compounds H2O and CO2 in a planetary atmosphere.
Other absorption bands using the JWST can only be detected for much higher
S/Ns, which is not achievable by just co-adding transit observations since this
would be far beyond the planned mission time of JWST.(abridged)

provide some fault-tolerance and guarantee system reliability. Different coding
techniques have been proposed to provide the required redundancy more
efficiently than traditional replication schemes. However, compared to
replication, coding techniques are less efficient for repairing lost
redundancy, as they require retrieval of larger amounts of data from larger
subsets of storage nodes. To mitigate these problems, several recent works have
presented locally repairable codes designed to minimize the repair traffic and
the number of nodes involved per repair. Unfortunately, existing methods often
lead to codes where there is only one subset of nodes able to repair a piece of
lost data, limiting the local repairability to the availability of the nodes in
this subset. In this paper, we present a new family of locally repairable codes
that allows different trade-offs between the number of contacted nodes per
repair, and the number of different subsets of nodes that enable this repair.
We show that slightly increasing the number of contacted nodes per repair
allows to have repair alternatives, which in turn increases the probability of
being able to perform efficient repairs. Finally, we present pg-BLRC, an
explicit construction of locally repairable codes with multiple repair
alternatives, constructed from partial geometries, in particular from
Generalized Quadrangles. We show how these codes can achieve practical lengths
and high rates, while requiring a small number of nodes per repair, and
providing multiple repair alternatives.

constructed from the Green function of three conserved currents that are dual
to the higher spin fields. Conservation of the currents implies lowest order
gauge invariance. These vertex functions appear by the UV divergence as the
residue of the highest order pole in the dimensional regularization parameter
\epsilon. The method works for even D and maintains covariance at any step. The
resulting formula is quite concise.

it was identified with VLT/NaCo as a bona-fide exoplanet with a mass of about 9
times that of Jupiter at an orbital separation of 8-9 AU. The link between the
planet and the dusty disk is unambiguously attested and this system provides an
opportunity to study the disk/planet interactions and to constrain formation
and evolutionary models of gas giant planets. Still, {\beta} Pictoris b had
never been confirmed with other telescopes so far. Aims. We aimed at an
independent confirmation using a different instrument. Methods. We retrieved
archive images from Gemini South obtained with the instrument NICI, which is
designed for high contrast imaging. The observations combine coronagraphy and
angular differential imaging and were obtained at three epochs in Nov. 2008,
Dec. 2009 and Dec. 2010. Results. We report the detection with NICI of the
planet {\beta} Pictoris b in Dec. 2010 images at a separation of 404 \pm 10 mas

impose different classes of integral conditions, instead of usual boundary
ones. Well-posedness results for the heat equation under the condition that the
moments of order 0 and 1 are conserved had been known so far only in the case
of N=1 -- for which such conditions can be easily interpreted as conservation
of mass and barycenter. In this paper we show that in the case of general $N$
the heat equation with such integral conditions is still well-posed, upon
suitably relax the notion of solution.
  Existence and uniqueness of solutions with general initial data in a suitable
space of distibutions over $(0,1)^N$ are proved by introducing two appropriate
realizations of the Laplacian and checking by form methods that they generate
analytic semigroups. The solution thus obtained does however solve the heat
equation only in a certain distributional sense.
  However, it turns out that one of these realizations is tightly related to a
well-known object of operator theory, the Krein--von Neumann extension of the
Laplacian. This connection also establishes well-posedness in a classical
sense, as long as the initial data are $L^2$-functions.

derived the transition between both regimes from contact physics, we used the

law relation between dust-aggregate mass and impact velocity for the threshold

show that the transition between both regimes is not sharp, but follows a

when we add M2/D2-branes on the same directions with the near horizon branes of
Aharony-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena model, all symmetries and supersymmetries
are preserved trivially. In the case, we gain a localized object just in the

SU(4)x U(1), and agrees with a marginal boundary operator of the conformal

transformation, we see that the solution is localized in the Euclideanized
AdS_4 space and is attributable to the included anti-M2/D2-branes, which are
also necessary to ensure that there is no backreaction. The resultant theory
now breaks all N=8,6 supersymmetries to N=0 while other symmetries are so
preserved. The dual boundary operator then sets up from the skew-whiffing of
the representations 8_s and 8_v for the supercharges and scalars respectively,

address another alternate bulk to boundary matching procedure through turning
on one of the gauge fields of the full U(N)_k x U(N)_-k gauge group in the same

turbulent flows from the observation of an image sequence. From a Bayesian
perspective, a divergence-free isotropic fractional Brownian motion (fBm) is
chosen as a prior model for instantaneous turbulent velocity fields. This
self-similar prior characterizes accurately second-order statistics of velocity
fields in incompressible isotropic turbulence. Nevertheless, the associated
maximum a posteriori involves a fractional Laplacian operator which is delicate
to implement in practice. To deal with this issue, we propose to decompose the
divergent-free fBm on well-chosen wavelet bases. As a first alternative, we
propose to design wavelets as whitening filters. We show that these filters are
fractional Laplacian wavelets composed with the Leray projector. As a second
alternative, we use a divergence-free wavelet basis, which takes implicitly
into account the incompressibility constraint arising from physics. Although
the latter decomposition involves correlated wavelet coefficients, we are able
to handle this dependence in practice. Based on these two wavelet
decompositions, we finally provide effective and efficient algorithms to
approach the maximum a posteriori. An intensive numerical evaluation proves the
relevance of the proposed wavelet-based self-similar priors.

of superconducting quantum metamaterials an array of SQUIDs incorporated in a
low-dissipative transmission line (resonant cavity) will be studied. This
system will be modeled as a set of two-levels systems (qubits) strongly
interacting with resonant cavity photons. We predict and analyze {a
second(first)-order phase transition} between an incoherent (the
high-temperature phase) and coherent (the low-temperatures phase) states of
photons. In equilibrium state the partition function $Z$ of the electromagnetic
field (EF) in the cavity is determined by the effective action
$S_{eff}\{P(\tau)\}$ that, in turn, depends on imaginary-time dependent
momentum of photon field $P(\tau)$. We show that the order parameter of this
phase transition is the $P_{0}(\tau)$ minimizing the effective action of a
whole system. In the incoherent state the order parameter $P_{0}(\tau)=0$ but
at low temperatures we obtain various coherent states characterized by non-zero
values of $P_{0}(\tau)$. This phase transition in many aspects resembles the
Peierls metal-insulator and the metal-superconductor phase transitions. The
critical temperature of such phase transition $T^\star$ is determined by the
energy splitting of two-level systems $\Delta$, a number of SQUIDs in the array
$N$, and the strength of the interaction $\eta$ between SQUIDs and photons in

towards the ground state. Kinetic self-assembly is intrinsically more flexible

morphology of the final phase by tuning both the interactions and the
thermodynamic pathway leading to kinetic arrest. Here we propose strategies to
direct the gelation of two-component colloidal mixtures by sequentially
activating selective interspecies and intra-species interactions. We
investigate morphological changes in the structure of the arrested phases by
means of event driven molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and experimentally
using DNA-coated colloids (DNACCs). Our approach can be exploited to finely

objective is for an agent to learn to choose actions so as to minimise a total
cost function. In this paper we show that when discretized time is used to
model the motion of the agent, it can be very important to do ""clipping"" on the
motion of the agent in the final time step of the trajectory. By clipping we
mean that the final time step of the trajectory is to be truncated such that
the agent stops exactly at the first terminal state reached, and no distance
further. We demonstrate that when clipping is omitted, learning performance can
fail to reach the optimum; and when clipping is done properly, learning
performance can improve significantly.
  The clipping problem we describe affects algorithms which use explicit
derivatives of the model functions of the environment to calculate a learning
gradient. These include Backpropagation Through Time for Control, and methods
based on Dual Heuristic Dynamic Programming. However the clipping problem does
not significantly affect methods based on Heuristic Dynamic Programming,
Temporal Differences or Policy Gradient Learning algorithms. Similarly, the

spectroscopic observations, 150 years after the nova eruption. The spectral
properties pointed to a high-inclination system with a comparatively low
mass-transfer rate. In this paper we show that the object is an eclipsing
system with an orbital period of 3.32 h. It has enhanced long-term variability
that can be interpreted as 'stunted' dwarf-nova-type outbursts. Using the
ingress and egress times of the eclipsed components we calculate the radius of
the central object. The latter turns out to be significantly larger than a
white dwarf and we identify it with a hot inner disc. The implications for
models on the behaviour of post-novae are discussed.

twistorial point of view. In particular, it was demonstrated that the twistor
transform between chiral zero-rest-mass fields and cohomology classes on
twistor space can be generalized from four to six dimensions. On the other
hand, the possibility of generalizing the correspondence between instanton
gauge fields and holomorphic bundles over twistor space is questionable. It was
shown by Saemann and Wolf that holomorphic line bundles over the canonical
twistor space Tw(X) (defined as a bundle of almost complex structures over the
six-dimensional manifold X) correspond to pure-gauge Maxwell potentials, i.e.
the twistor transform fails. On the example of X=CP^3 we show that there exists
a twistor correspondence between Abelian or non-Abelian Yang-Mills instantons
on CP^3 and holomorphic bundles over complex submanifolds of Tw(CP^3), but it
is not so efficient as in the four-dimensional case because the twistor
transform does not parametrize instantons by unconstrained holomorphic data as
it does in four dimensions.

molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at high temperature. The method is applied
to the highly anharmonic case of dense hydrogen up to 500 K for pressures
ranging from 180 GPa to 300 GPa. On heating or pressurizing we find first-order
phase transitions at the experimental conditions of the phase III - IV
boundary. Direct comparison of Raman vibrons with experiment provides excellent
discrimination between subtly different structures, found in MD. We find
candidate structures whose Raman spectra are in good agreement with experiment.
The new phase obtained in high temperature simulations adopts a dynamic, simple
hexagonal structure with three layer types: freely rotating hydrogen molecules,
static hexagonal trimers and rotating hexagonal trimers. We show that
previously calculated structures for phase IV are inconsistent with experiment,
and their appearance in simulation is due to finite size effects.

can handle space- and time-dependent mass and potential terms and utilizes
exact discrete transparent boundary conditions (DTBCs). Based on a space- and
time-staggered leap-frog scheme it avoids fermion doubling and preserves the
dispersion relation of the continuum problem for mass zero (Weyl equation)
exactly. Considering boundary regions, each with a constant mass and potential
term, the associated DTBCs are derived by first applying this finite difference
scheme and then using the Z-transform in the discrete time variable. The
resulting constant coefficient difference equation in space can be solved
exactly on each of the two semi-infinite exterior domains. Admitting only
solutions in $l_2$ which vanish at infinity is equivalent to imposing outgoing
boundary conditions. An inverse Z-transformation leads to exact DTBCs in form
of a convolution in discrete time which suppress spurious reflections at the
boundaries and enforce stability of the whole space-time scheme. An exactly
preserved functional for the norm of the Dirac spinor on the staggered grid is
presented. Simulations of Gaussian wave packets, leaving the computational
domain without reflection, demonstrate the quality of the DTBCs numerically, as
well as the importance of a faithful representation of the energy-momentum
dispersion relation on a grid.

prove its consistency. We apply our method to autosomal SNPs genotypic data

pulsed magnetic fields up to 14 T and 62 T, respectively. Distinct anomalies
with significant changes in the sound velocity and attenuation are found in

order at T_s = 27 K and at the transition from the incommensurate to the

While the magnetization evolves gradually with field, steplike increments in
the ultrasound clearly signal a transition into a new magneto-structural state
between 6.2 and 16.5 K and at high magnetic fields. We argue that this is a
high-symmetry phase with only the longitudinal component of the magnetization
being ordered, while the transverse helical component remains disordered. This

nonlinear Gross-Pitaevskii equation and exhibit phenomena of nonlinear

more eigenvalues and the corresponding wave functions coalesce at critical
values of external parameters. E.g. in condensates without long-range
interactions a stable and an unstable state are created in a tangent
bifurcation when the scattering length of the contact interaction is varied. At
the critical point the coalescing states show the properties of an exceptional

investigate in detail the signatures of exceptional points related to
bifurcations in dipolar condensates. For the perturbation by two parameters,
viz. the scattering length and a parameter breaking the cylindrical symmetry of
the harmonic trap, two cases leading to different characteristic eigenvalue and
eigenvector patterns under cyclic variations of the parameters need to be
distinguished. The observed structures resemble those of three coalescing

the three colossal pyramids are oriented upon the four cardinal directions,
there have been a great many suggestions as to how this was achieved and why it
was of importance. Surprisingly, given the many astronomical hypotheses and
speculations that have been offered in the intervening 130 years, there have
been remarkably few attempts to reaffirm or improve on the basic survey data
concerning the primary orientations.
  This paper presents the results of a week-long Total Station survey
undertaken by the authors during December 2006 whose principal aim was to
clarify the basic data concerning the orientation of each side of the three
large pyramids and to determine, as accurately as possible, the orientations of
as many as possible of the associated structures. The principal difference
between this and all previous surveys is that it focuses upon measurements of
sequences of points along multiple straight and relatively well preserved
structural segments, with best-fit techniques being used to provide the best
estimate of their orientation, as opposed to simple triangulation between
directly identified or extrapolated corners.
  Our results suggest that there is only a very slight difference in
orientation (c. 0.5 arc minutes) between the north-south axes of Khufu's and
Khafre's pyramids, that the sides of Khafre's are more perfectly perpendicular
than those of Khufu's, and that the east-west axis is closer to true
cardinality in both cases. The broader context of associated structures
suggests that the east-west orientation in relation to sunrise or (in one case)
sunset may have been a, or even the, key factor in many cases.

models of data. In many modern applications, such as population genetics, it is
not possible to apply standard methods based on evaluating the likelihood
functions of the models, as these are numerically intractable. Approximate
Bayesian computation (ABC) is a commonly used alternative for such situations.
ABC simulates data x for many parameter values under each model, which is
compared to the observed data xobs. More weight is placed on models under which
S(x) is close to S(xobs), where S maps data to a vector of summary statistics.
Previous work has shown the choice of S is crucial to the efficiency and
accuracy of ABC. This paper provides a method to select good summary statistics
for model choice. It uses a preliminary step, simulating many x values from all
models and fitting regressions to this with the model as response. The
resulting model weight estimators are used as S in an ABC analysis. Theoretical
results are given to justify this as approximating low dimensional sufficient
statistics. A substantive application is presented: choosing between competing

observations of the pulsar PSR J0205+6449 in the young pulsar-wind nebula 3C
58, made in 2007 and 2010. We employed a novel technique where the ~105-m Green
Bank telescope is used simultaneously to obtain single-dish data used to
determine the pulsar's period as well as to obtain the VLBI data, allowing the
VLBI correlation to be gated synchronously with the pulse to increase the
signal-to-noise. The high timing noise of this young pulsar precludes the
determination of the proper motion from the pulsar timing. We derive the
position of the pulsar accurate at the milliarcsecond level, which is
consistent with a re-determined position from the Chandra X-ray observations.
We reject the original tentative optical identification of the pulsar by
Shearer and Neustroev (2008), but rather identify a different optical
counterpart on their images, with R-band magnitude ~24. We also determine an
accurate proper motion for PSR J0205+6449 of (2.3 +- 0.3) mas/yr, corresponding
to a projected velocity of only (35 +- 6) km/s for a distance of 3.2 kpc, at
p.a. -38 deg. This projected velocity is quite low compared to the velocity
dispersion of known pulsars of ~200 km/s. Our measured proper motion does not
suggest any particular kinematic age for the pulsar.

in $\Cc$. We study $A$-(co)ring structures on the left $A$-module $A\ot X$.
These correspond to (co)algebra structures in $EM(\Cc)(A)$, the Eilenberg-Moore
category associated to $\Cc$ and $A$. The ring structures are in bijective
correspondence to wreaths in $\Cc$, and their category of representations is
the category of representations over the induced wreath product. The coring
structures are in bijective correspondence to cowreaths in $\Cc$, and their
category of corepresentations is the category of generalized entwined modules.
We present several examples coming from (co)actions of Hopf algebras and their
generalizations. Various notions of smash products that have appeared in the
literature appear as special cases of our construction.

  Approaches for Representing Uncertainty and Making Decisions","Full version of an article [arXiv:1210.4853] that appeared in UAI '12",,,,"cs.GT cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a setting where an agent's uncertainty is represented by a set of
probability measures, rather than a single measure. Measure-by-measure updating
of such a set of measures upon acquiring new information is well-known to
suffer from problems; agents are not always able to learn appropriately. To
deal with these problems, we propose using weighted sets of probabilities: a
representation where each measure is associated with a weight, which denotes
its significance. We describe a natural approach to updating in such a
situation and a natural approach to determining the weights. We then show how
this representation can be used in decision-making, by modifying a standard
approach to decision making -- minimizing expected regret -- to obtain minimax
weighted expected regret (MWER). We provide an axiomatization that
characterizes preferences induced by MWER both in the static and dynamic case.

strong magnetic field, dispersionless magnons start emitting at any arbitrarily

dispersed they are generated when the spinpolaron velocity exceeds the minimum
phase velocity of magnons. The maximum power of magnon generation caused by the
drift of spinpolarons is estimated.

the recent observed CP-violation from like-sign dimuon charge asymmetry in the
B system.

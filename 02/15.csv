an open family of non-zero masses for which there exist smooth, finite energy,
and exponentially growing solutions to the corresponding Klein-Gordon equation.
If desired, for any non-zero integer m, an exponentially growing solution can
be found with mass arbitrarily close to |am|/2Mr_+. In addition to its direct
relevance for the stability of Kerr as a solution to the Einstein-Klein-Gordon
system, our result provides the first rigorous construction of a superradiant
instability. Finally, we note that this linear instability for the Klein-Gordon
equation contrasts strongly with recent work establishing linear stability for
the wave equation.

utilizing static team and person-by-person optimality criteria is well

distributed stochastic differential systems possibly due to technical
difficulties inherent with decentralized decision strategies.
  In this first part of the two-part paper, we derive team optimality and
person-by-person optimality conditions for distributed stochastic differential
systems with different information structures. The optimality conditions are
given in terms of a Hamiltonian system of equations described by a system of
coupled backward and forward stochastic differential equations and a
conditional Hamiltonian, under both regular and relaxed strategies. Our
methodology is based on the semi martingale representation theorem and
variational methods. Throughout the presentation we discuss similarities to

that we explore some efficient ways of handling these data. This study takes
the ""divide and conquer"" approach for analyzing high dimensional genomic data.
Our aims include reducing the dimensionality of the problem that has to be
dealt one at a time, improving the performance and interpretability of the
models. We propose using the inherent structures in the genome; to divide the
bigger problem into manageable parts. In plant and animal breeding studies a
distinction is made between the commercial value (additive + epistatic genetic
effects) and the breeding value (additive genetic effects) of an individual
since it is expected that some of the epistatic genetic effects will be lost
due to recombination. In this paper, we argue that the breeder can take
advantage of some of the epistatic marker effects in regions of low
recombination. The models introduced here aim to estimate local epistatic line
heritability by using the genetic map information and combine the local
additive and epistatic effects. To this end, we have used semi-parametric mixed
models with multiple local genomic relationship matrices with hierarchical
testing designs and lasso post-processing for sparsity in the final model and
speed. Our models produce good predictive performance along with genetic
association information.

the structure of the radio-infrared emission region. With TEXES on the
NASA-IRTF we measured the 10.5um [SIV] emission line with effective spectral
resolutions, including thermal broadening, of ~25 and ~3 km/s and spatial
resolution ~1"". The line profile shows two distinct, spatially coextensive,
emission features. The stronger feature is at galactic velocity and has FWHM 47
km/s. The second feature is ~44km/s redward of the first and has FWHM 32 km/s.
We argue that these are two giant embedded clusters, and estimate their masses
to be ~3x10^5Mo and ~1.5x10^5 Mo. The velocity shift is unexpectedly large for
such a small spatial offset. We suggest that it may arise in a previously
undetected kinematic feature remaining from the violent merger that formed the

performed by Gratton and colleagues on 150 subdwarf stars spectroscopically
observed at high-resolution. We then use a larger sample of 9131 giants (with

Results: The RAVE kinematical and chemical data proved to be reliable by
reproducing the results by Gratton et al. obtained with high-resolution

clear sign that some of these stars have experienced the effects of heating

theoretically explored as a function of Landau-level splitting, using highly
efficient real-space methods to compute the Kubo conductivities (both
$\sigma_{xx}$ and Hall $\sigma_{xy}$). As long as valley-degeneracy is
maintained, the obtained critical conductivity $\sigma_{xx}\simeq 1.4 e^{2}/h$
is robust upon disorder increase (by almost one order of magnitude) and
magnetic fields ranging from about 2 to 200 Tesla. When the sublattice symmetry
is broken, $\sigma_{xx}$ eventually vanishes at the Dirac point owing to
localization effects, whereas the critical conductivities of pseudospin-split
states (dictating the width of a $\sigma_{xy}=0$ plateau) change to
$\sigma_{xx}\simeq e^{2}/h$, regardless of the splitting strength, superimposed
disorder, or magnetic strength. These findings point towards the non

with combinatorial problems that arise in practice. It is known, e.g., by the
success of CPLEX, that preprocessing and simplification can greatly speed up
the process of optimizing an ILP. The present work seeks to further the
theoretical understanding of preprocessing for ILPs by initiating a rigorous
study within the framework of parameterized complexity and kernelization.
  A famous result of Lenstra (Mathematics of Operations Research, 1983) shows
that feasibility of any ILP with n variables and m constraints can be decided
in time O(c^{n^3} m^c'). Thus, by a folklore argument, any such ILP admits a
kernelization to an equivalent instance of size O(c^{n^3}). It is known, that
unless NP \subseteq coNP/poly and the polynomial hierarchy collapses, no
kernelization with size bound polynomial in n is possible. However, this lower
bound only applies for the case when constraints may include an arbitrary
number of variables since it follows from lower bounds for Satisfiability and
Hitting Set, whose bounded arity variants admit polynomial kernelizations.
  We consider the feasibility problem for ILPs Ax<= b where A is an
r-row-sparse matrix parameterized by the number of variables. We show that the
kernelizability of this problem depends strongly on the range of the variables.
If the range is unbounded then this problem does not admit a polynomial
kernelization unless NP \subseteq coNP/poly. If, on the other hand, the range
of each variable is polynomially bounded in n then we do get a polynomial
kernelization. Additionally, this holds also for the more general case when the
maximum range d is an additional parameter, i.e., the size obtained is
polynomial in n+d.

stable approximations to the problem of minimizing the weighted least-squares

computing $u^{\eta}\equiv \arg\min_{u\in X}\frac{1}{2}\vert\vert

error covariance, $Y$ is the observation space and $X$ is a set of admissible

means of the regularizing Levenberg-Marquardt scheme developed in
\cite{Hanke,Hanke2}. Under certain conditions on $G$, the theory of
\cite{Hanke,Hanke2} ensures convergence of the scheme to stable approximations
to the inverse problem. We propose an implementation of the regularizing
Levenberg-Marquardt scheme that enforces prior knowledge of the geologic
properties. In particular, the prior mean $\overline{u}$ is incorporated in the
initial guess of the algorithm and the prior error covariance $C$ is enforced
through the definition of the parameter space $X$. Our main goal is to
numerically show that the proposed implementation of the regularizing
Levenberg-Marquardt scheme of Hanke is a robust method capable of providing
accurate estimates of the geologic properties for small noise measurements. The
performance for recovering the true permeability with the regularizing
Levenberg-Marquardt scheme is compared against the more standard techniques for
history matching proposed in \cite{Li,Tavakoli,svdRML,Oliver}. Our numerical

considered for an ultracold atomic gas with resonant interactions in the
zero-range limit. A Feynman diagrammatic series is developed for the one-body
and two-body propagators providing information about the polaron and molecule
channel respectively. The DiagMC technique allows us to reach diagram orders
that are high enough for extrapolation to infinite order. The robustness of the
extracted results is examined by checking various resummation techniques and by
running the simulations with various choices for the propagators and vertex
functions. It turns out that dressing the lines in the diagrams as much as
possible is not always the optimal choice. We also identify classes of dominant
diagrams for the one-body and two-body self-energy in the region of strong
interaction. These dominant diagrams turn out to be the leading processes of
the strong-coupling limit. The quasiparticle energies and $Z$-factor are
obtained as a function of the interaction strength. We find that the DiagMC
results for the molecule and polaron properties are very similar to those
obtained with a variational ansatz. Surprisingly, this variational ansatz gives
very good predictions for the quasiparticle residue even when this residue is
significantly smaller than one.

this transition can be observed for sub-critical Reynolds numbers. In that
case, the basin of attraction of the laminar state coexists with the sustained
turbulence. In this article, the trajectory on the separatrix between these two
states is simulated. The state on the separatrix is independent from the
initial condition and is dynamically connected to both the laminar flow and the
turbulence. Such an edge state provides information regarding the basic
features of the transitional flow. The solution takes the form of a low speed
streak, flanked by two quasi-streamwise sinuous vortices. The shape of the
streaks is close to that simulated with the linear optimal perturbation method.
This solution is compared to existing results concerning streak breakdown. The
simulations are realized in a temporal framework for a local boundary layer,
with periodic boundary conditions in the streamwise direction. A dedicated
model, based on a scale separation, is presented. The mean flow is a solution
of the Prandtl boundary layer equations while the superposed small-scale
fluctuations are a solution of the periodic Navier-Stokes equations. The model
is validated with turbulent flow simulations and satisfactorily reproduces the
physical characteristics of a boundary layer flow, especially in the outer
region, where external fluid is entrained toward the boundary layer.

algorithm either computes multiple solutions or the solution oscillates below
and above the fraction. This implies that the min-sum algorithm computes the
optimal integral solution only if the LP has a unique optimal solution that is
integral.
  The converse is not true in general. For a special case of packing and
covering problems, we prove that if the LP has a unique optimal solution that
is integral and on the boundary of the box constraints, then the min-sum
algorithm computes the optimal solution in pseudo-polynomial time.
  Our results unify and extend recent results for the maximum weight matching
problem by [Sanghavi et al.,'2011] and [Bayati et al., 2011] and for the
maximum weight independent set problem [Sanghavi et al.'2009].

deviations to circular motions in the disk that can be modeled and explained
with the inclusion of a radial inflow probably generated by a bar or by spiral

At the same time, from the analysis of position-velocity diagrams, we found
some evidence that the extraplanar gas could lag in rotation velocity with
respect to the midplane rotation.

star formation regions are rare. A technique which has found application for
the derivation of spatial densities in Galactic star formation regions utilizes
the density-sensitive properties of the K-doublet transitions of formaldehyde
(H2CO). In this paper, we present an extension of our survey of the
formaldehyde 1(10)-1(11) (lambda = 6.2 cm) and 2(11)-2(12) (lambda = 2.1 cm)
K-doublet transitions of H2CO in a sample of 56 starburst systems (Mangum etal.
2008). We have extended the number of galaxies in which both transitions have
been detected from 5 to 13. We have improved our spatial density measurements
by incorporating kinetic temperatures based upon NH3 measurements of 11 of the
galaxies with a total of 14 velocity components in our sample (Mangum etal.
2013). Our spatial density measurements lie in a relatively narrow range of
from 10^(4.5) to 10^(5.5) cm^(-3). This implies that the Schmidt-Kennicutt
relation between L_(IR) and M_(dense): (1) Is an indication of the dense gas
mass reservoir available to form stars, and (2) Is not directly dependent upon
a higher average density driving the star formation process in the most
luminous starburst galaxies. We have also used our H2CO measurements to derive
two separate measures of the dense gas mass which are generally smaller, in
many cases by a factor of 10^2-10^3, than those derived using HCN. This
disparity suggests that H2CO traces a denser, more compact, component of the
giant molecular clouds in our starburst galaxy sample.
  We also report measurements of the rotationally-excited lambda = 6.3 cm

states in a model independent way. We use the weak-coupling version of the
effective field theory named potential NRQCD with the static potential exactly
incorporated in the leading order Hamiltonian. The precision we reach is
$k_{\gamma}^3/m^2\times{\cal O}(\alpha_s^2,v^2)$ and
$k_{\gamma}^3/m^2\times{\cal O}(v^4)$ for the allowed and forbidden transitions
respectively. We also resum the large logarithms associated to the heavy quark
mass scale. The specific transitions considered in this paper are the
following: $\Upsilon(1S) \to \eta_b(1S)\,\gamma$, $J/\psi(1S) \to
\eta_c(1S)\,\gamma$, $h_b(1P) \to \chi_{b0,1}(1P)\,\gamma$, $\chi_{b2}(1P) \to

new power counting is found to be large and the exact treatment of the soft
logarithms of the static potential makes the factorization scale dependence
much smaller. The convergence for the $b\bar b$ ground state is quite good, and
also quite reasonable for the $c\bar c$ ground state and the $b\bar b$ 1P
state. For all of them we give solid predictions. For the 2S decays the
situation is less conclusive, yet our results are perfectly consistent with
existing data, as the previous disagreement with experiment for the
$\Upsilon(2S) \to \eta_b(1S)\,\gamma$ decay fades away. We also profit to
compute some expectation values like the electromagnetic radius, r^2, or p^2.
We find r^2 to be nicely convergent in all cases, whereas the convergence of
p^2 is typically worse.

clarify the parameter region in which each of these two approaches is valid:
while the fermion mass $m$ is fixed in the standard large-$N_c$ arguments ('t
Hooft large-$N_c$ limit), $m$ must be scaled appropriately with a certain
negative power of $N_c$ in order for the gauge theories to be described by the
$\chi$RMT. Then, although these two limits are not compatible in general, we
show that the breakdown of chiral symmetry can be detected by combining the
large-$N_c$ argument and the $\chi$RMT with some cares. As a concrete example,
we numerically study the four dimensional $SU(N_c)$ gauge theory with $N_f=2$
heavy adjoint fermions, introduced as the center symmetry preserver keeping the
infrared physics intact, on a $2^4$ lattice. By looking at the low-lying
eigenvalues of the Dirac operator for a massless probe fermion in the adjoint
representation, we find that the chiral symmetry is indeed broken with the
expected breaking pattern. This result reproduces a well-known fact that the
chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken in the pure $SU(N_c)$ gauge theory in
the large-$N_c$ and the large-volume limit, and therefore supports the validity
of the combined approach. We also provide the interpretation of the gap and
unexpected $N_c$-scaling, both of which are observed in the Dirac spectrum.

(B) = 0.90 mag). Similarly, the Si II lambda_6355 velocity at the time of B-max
is greater than ""normal"" for a SN Ia, but it is not extreme (v_Si = 13,400
km/s). The -14d and -13d spectra clearly resolve HVF from Si II lambda_6355 as
separate absorptions from a detached line forming region. At these very early
phases, detached HVF are prevalent in all lines. From -12d to -6d, HVF and PVF
are detected simultaneously, and the two line forming regions maintain a
constant separation of about 8,000 km/s. After -6d all absorption features are
PVF. The observations of SN 2009ig provide a complete picture of the transition
from HVF to PVF. Most SN Ia show evidence for HVF from multiple lines in
spectra obtained before -10d, and we compare the spectra of SN 2009ig to
observations of other SN. We show that each of the unusual line profiles for Si
II lambda_6355 found in early-time spectra of SN Ia correlate to a specific
phase in a common development sequence from HVF to PVF.

circumplanetary disks around wide-orbit proto-gas giants. At large distances
from the star (~100 AU), gravitational instability followed by disk
fragmentation can form low-mass substellar companions (massive gas giants
and/or brown dwarfs) that are likely to host large disks. We examine the
initial evolution of these subdisks and their role in regulating the growth of
their substellar companions, as well as explore consequences of their
interactions with circumstellar material. We find that subdisks that form in
the context of GIs evolve quickly from a very massive state. Long-term
accretion rates from the subdisk onto the proto-gas giant reach ~0.3 Jupiter
masses per kyr. We also find consistency with previous simulations,
demonstrating that subdisks are truncated at ~1/3 of the companion's Hill
radius and are thick, with (h/r) of great than or equal to 0.2. The thickness
of subdisks draws to question the use of thin-disk approximations for
understanding the behavior of subdisks, and the morphology of subdisks has
implications for the formation and extent of satellite systems. These subdisks
create heating events in otherwise cold regions of the circumstellar disk, and
serve as planet formation beacons that can be detected by instruments such as
ALMA.

include modeling the capacity of enzymes to catalyze reactions and the clinical

important for understanding search difficulty. This paper presents a novel and
transparent characterization of NK landscapes.
  We prove that NK landscapes can be represented by parametric linear
interaction models where model coefficients have meaningful interpretations. We
derive the statistical properties of the model coefficients, providing insight
into how the NK algorithm parses importance to main effects and interactions.
An important insight derived from the linear model representation is that the
rank of the linear model defined by the NK algorithm is correlated with the
number of local optima, a strong determinant of landscape complexity and search
difficulty. We show that the maximal rank for an NK landscape is achieved
through epistatic interactions that form partially balanced incomplete block
designs. Finally, an analytic expression representing the expected number of
local optima on the landscape is derived, providing a way to quickly compute
the expected number of local optima for very large landscapes.

punishers in the group. Phase diagrams in dependence on the punishment fine and
cost reveal that the two types of punishers cannot coexist. Spontaneous
coarsening of the two strategies leads to an indirect territorial competition
with the defectors, which is won by unconditional punishers only if the
sanctioning is inexpensive. Otherwise conditional punishers are the victors of
the indirect competition, indicating that under more realistic conditions they
are indeed the more effective strategy. Both continuous and discontinuous phase
transitions as well as tricritical points characterize the complex evolutionary
dynamics, which is due to multipoint interactions that are introduced by
conditional punishment. We propose indirect territorial competition as a
generally applicable mechanism relying on pattern formation, by means of which
spatial structure can be utilized by seemingly subordinate strategies to avoid

widely used in the observational literature, as well as a more stringent 3D
isolation criterion that uses the full 3D-real space information. In
qualitative agreement with observational results, isolated model galaxies have
larger fractions of late-type, star forming galaxies with respect to randomly
selected samples of galaxies with the same mass distribution. We also find that
the samples of isolated model galaxies typically contain a fraction of less
than 15 per cent of satellite galaxies, that reside at the outskirts of their
parent haloes where the galaxy number density is low. Projection effects cause
a contamination of 2D samples of about 18 per cent, while we estimate a typical

small (few per cent) fraction of bulge dominated galaxies (B/T > 0.8) whose
bulges have been built mainly by minor mergers. Our study demonstrates that
about 65-70 per cent of 2D isolated galaxies that are classified as isolated at
z = 0 have indeed been completely isolated since z = 1 and only 7 per cent have
had more than 3 neighbours within a comoving radius of 1 Mpc. Irrespectively of
the isolation criteria, roughly 45 per cent of isolated galaxies have
experienced at least one merger event in the past (most of the mergers are

classical grid of ATLAS9 models computed by (Castelli & Kurucz, 2004), the grid
of new ATLAS9 models computed for the APOGEE survey (Mezsaros et al., 2012) and
the MARCS models with the standard composition (Gustafsson et al., 2008). When
the ATLAS9 models are used, new model atmospheres are calculated starting from
an existing guess model and according to the pre-tabulated Opacity Distribution
Functions (ODF) and Rosseland opacity tables. When MARCS are used, each new
model is obtained by interpolating within the MARCS grid.

affected by spatial confinement, which is ubiquitous in biological systems.
Motivated by recent advancements in single DNA molecule experiments based on
nanofluidic devices, and by the introduction of algorithms capable of detecting
knots in open chains, we investigate numerically the entanglement of linear,
open DNA chains confined inside nano-slits. The results regard the abundance,
type and length of occurring knots and are compared with recent findings for
DNA inside nano-channels. In both cases, the width of the confining region, D,
spans the 30nm- 1\mu m range and the confined DNA chains are 1 to 4\mu m long.
It is found that the knotting probability is maximum for slit widths in the
70-100nm range. However, over the considered DNA contour lengths, the maximum
incidence of knots remains below 20%, while for channel confinement it tops
50%. Further differences of the entanglement are seen for the average contour
length of the knotted region which drops significantly below D ~100nm for
channel-confinement, while it stays approximately constant for slit-like
confinement. These properties ought to reverberate in different kinetic
properties of linear DNA depending on confinement and could be detectable
experimentally or exploitable in nano-technological applications.

turbulent velocities, if the one-dimensional velocity dispersion is larger than
approximately 35 km/s, the gas moves into an unstable regime that leads to
rapid heating. I study the implications of this turbulent runaway, showing that
it causes a hot gas outflow to form in all galaxies with a gas surface density

velocities above 200 km/s, the sonic point of this hot outflow should lie
interior to the region containing cold gas and stars, while for galaxies with
smaller escape velocities, the sonic point should lie outside this region. This
leads to efficient cold cloud acceleration in higher mass galaxies, while in
lower mass galaxies, clouds may be ejected by random turbulent motions rather
than accelerated by the wind. Finally, I show that energy balance cannot be
achieved at all for turbulent media above a surface density of approximately

mass loading factor scale as expected for momentum-driven outflows for larger
galaxies and energy-driven outflows for dwarfs (sigma<75 km/s). To obtain
predicted HI masses, we employ a simple but effective local correction for
particle self-shielding, and an observationally-constrained transition from
neutral to molecular hydrogen. Our ezw simulation produces an HI mass function
whose faint-end slope of -1.3 agrees well with observations from the ALFALFA
survey; other models agree less well. Satellite galaxies have a bimodal
distribution in HI fraction versus halo mass, with smaller satellites and/or
those in larger halos more often being HI-deficient. At a given stellar mass,
HI content correlates with star formation rate and inversely correlates with
metallicity, as expected if driven by stochasticity in the accretion rate. To
higher redshifts, massive HI galaxies disappear and the mass function steepens.
The global cosmic HI density conspires to remain fairly constant from z~5-0,
but the relative contribution from smaller galaxies increases with redshift.

of Messiah and Greenberg (1964) to the configuration space approach due to
Souriau (1967), Laidlaw and DeWitt (1971), Leinaas and Myrheim (1977), and
others. The former allows parastatistics, whereas the latter apparently leaves
room for bosons and fermions only. This seems to contradict the operator
approach as far as the admissibility of parastatistics is concerned. To resolve
this, we first prove that the topologically nontrivial configuration spaces of
the second approach are quantized by the algebras of observables of the first.
Second, we show that the irreducible representations of the latter may be
realized by vector bundle constructions, which include the line bundles of the
second approach: representations on higher-dimensional bundles (which define
parastatistics) cannot be excluded a priori. However, we show that the
corresponding particle states may always be realized in terms of bosons and/or
fermions with an unobserved internal degree of freedom. Although based on
non-relativistic quantum mechanics, this conclusion is analogous to the
rigorous results of the Doplicher-Haag-Roberts analysis in algebraic quantum

We develop theoretical justification for the effectiveness of
nearest-neighbor-like classification of time series. Our guiding hypothesis is
that in many applications, such as forecasting which topics will become trends
on Twitter, there aren't actually that many prototypical time series to begin
with, relative to the number of time series we have access to, e.g., topics
become trends on Twitter only in a few distinct manners whereas we can collect
massive amounts of Twitter data. To operationalize this hypothesis, we propose
a latent source model for time series, which naturally leads to a ""weighted
majority voting"" classification rule that can be approximated by a
nearest-neighbor classifier. We establish nonasymptotic performance guarantees
of both weighted majority voting and nearest-neighbor classification under our
model accounting for how much of the time series we observe and the model
complexity. Experimental results on synthetic data show weighted majority
voting achieving the same misclassification rate as nearest-neighbor
classification while observing less of the time series. We then use weighted
majority to forecast which news topics on Twitter become trends, where we are
able to detect such ""trending topics"" in advance of Twitter 79% of the time,
with a mean early advantage of 1 hour and 26 minutes, a true positive rate of

Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stt293",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Extended emission gamma-ray bursts are a subset of the `short' class of burst
which exhibit an early time rebrightening of gamma emission in their light
curves. This extended emission arises just after the initial emission spike,
and can persist for up to hundreds of seconds after trigger. When their light
curves are overlaid, our sample of 14 extended emission bursts show a
remarkable uniformity in their evolution, strongly suggesting a common central
engine powering the emission. One potential central engine capable of this is a
highly magnetized, rapidly rotating neutron star, known as a magnetar.
Magnetars can be formed by two compact objects coallescing, a scenario which is
one of the leading progenitor models for short bursts in general. Assuming a
magnetar is formed, we gain a value for the magnetic field and late time spin
period for 9 of the extended emission bursts by fitting the magnetic dipole
spin-down model of Zhang & Meszaros (2001). Assuming the magnetic field is
constant, and the observed energy release during extended emission is entirely
due to the spin-down of this magnetar, we then derive the spin period at birth
for the sample. We find all birth spin periods are in good agreement with those
predicted for a newly born magnetar.

observations were conducted on the Kuiper 1.55 m telescope in Arizona and the
STELLA-I robotic 1.2 m telescope in Tenerife, Spain. From the derived light
curves we extracted transit depths in R (0.65 {\mu}m), V (0.55 {\mu}m), and g'
(0.475 {\mu}m) bands. Most previous observations of this exoplanet suggest a
flat spectrum varying little with wavelength from the near-infrared to the
optical, corresponding to a low-scale-height, high-molecular-weight atmosphere.
However, a handful of observations around Ks band (~2.15 {\mu}m) and g-band
(~0.46 {\mu}m) are inconsistent with this scenario and suggest a variation on a
hydrogen- or water-dominated atmosphere that also contains a haze layer of
small particles. In particular, the g-band observations of de Mooij et al.
(2012), consistent with Rayleigh scattering, limit the potential atmosphere
compositions of GJ 1214b due to the increasing slope at optical wavelengths
(Howe & Burrows 2012). We find that our results overlap within errors the
short-wavelength observations of de Mooij et al. (2012), but are also
consistent with a spectral slope of zero in GJ 1214b in the optical wavelength
region. Our observations thus allow for a larger suite of possible atmosphere
compositions, including those with a high-molecular-weight and/or hazes.

reproduced by minijet contributions to the recombination of thermal and shower
partons. Without using hydrodynamics the minijet approach does not trace the
evolution of the expanding system. The thermal distribution of the medium
partons at the time of hadronization is assumed, but rapid thermalization
initially is not required so as to allow minijets to leave their footprints on
the system in the final state. Azimuthal anisotropy due to minijets is directly
calculated in the momentum space without any fluid assumption relating the
spatial eccentricity to $v_2$. There are no more parameters used, compared to
the hydro approach in fitting the data on $v_2$ and $p_T$ spectra. Thus both

of the system stops being adiabatic as a result of the critical slowing down in
the neighborhood of the critical point. In systems with a topologically
nontrivial vacuum manifold, disparate local choices of the ground state lead to
the formation of topological defects. The universality class of the transition
imprints a signature on the resulting density of topological defects: It obeys
a power law in the quench rate, with an exponent dictated by a combination of
the critical exponents of the transition. In inhomogeneous systems the
situation is more complicated, as the spontaneous symmetry breaking competes
with bias caused by the influence of the nearby regions that already chose the
new vacuum. As a result, the choice of the broken symmetry vacuum may be
inherited from the neighboring regions that have already entered the new phase.
This competition between the inherited and spontaneous symmetry breaking
enhances the role of causality, as the defect formation is restricted to a
fraction of the system where the front velocity surpasses the relevant sound
velocity and phase transition remains effectively homogeneous. As a
consequence, the overall number of topological defects can be substantially
suppressed. When the fraction of the system is small, the resulting total
number of defects is still given by a power law related to the universality
class of the transition, but exhibits a more pronounced dependence on the
quench rate. This enhanced dependence complicates the analysis but may also
facilitate experimental test of defect formation theories.

two-dimensional disk model to the available star+disk photometry and all
observed H2O lines, using a simple step-function parameterization of the water
vapor content near the disk surface. We find that water vapor is abundant
(~10^{-4} per H2) in a narrow ring, located at the disk transition radius some
4AU from the central star, but drops rapidly by several orders of magnitude
beyond 4.2 AU over a scale length of no more than 0.5AU. The inner disk
(0.5-4AU) is also dry, with an upper limit on the vertically averaged water
abundance of 10^{-6} per H2. The water vapor peak occurs at a radius
significantly more distant than that expected for a passive continuous disk
around a 0.6 Msun star, representing a volatile distribution in the TW Hya disk
that bears strong similarities to that of the solar system. This is
observational evidence for a snow line that moves outward with time in passive
disks, with a dry inner disk that results either from gas giant formation or
gas dissipation and a significant ice reservoir at large radii. The amount of
water present near the snow line is sufficient to potentially catalyze the
(further) formation of planetesimals and planets at distances beyond a few AU.

that the objective is concave in the source and noise densities and convex in
the density of the input to the channel. We then derive the necessary
conditions for optimality of the encoder and decoder mappings. A well known
result in information theory pertains to the linearity of optimal encoding and
decoding mappings in the scalar Gaussian source and channel setting, at all
channel signal-to-noise ratios (CSNRs). In this paper, we study this result
more generally, beyond the Gaussian source and channel, and derive the
necessary and sufficient condition for linearity of optimal mappings, given a
noise (or source) distribution, and a specified power constraint. We also prove
that the Gaussian source-channel pair is unique in the sense that it is the
only source-channel pair for which the optimal mappings are linear at more than
one CSNR values. Moreover, we show the asymptotic linearity of optimal mappings
for low CSNR if the channel is Gaussian regardless of the source and, at the
other extreme, for high CSNR if the source is Gaussian, regardless of the
channel. Our numerical results show strict improvement over prior methods. The
numerical approach is extended to the scenario of source-channel coding with
decoder side information. The resulting encoding mappings are shown to be
continuous relatives of, and in fact subsume as special case, the Wyner-Ziv
mappings encountered in digital distributed source coding systems.

triangular lattice. The origin of the VBS formation has remained controversial.
We investigate the microscopic mechanism by elucidating the $d$ orbital
character via on-site $^{51}$V NMR measurements in a single crystal up to 550 K
across a structural transition temperature $T_c$. The Knight shift, $K$, and
nuclear quadrupole frequency, $\delta \nu$, show that the 3d orbital with local
trigonal symmetry are reconstructed into a $d_{yz}d_{zx}$ orbital order below
$T_c$. Together with the NMR spectra with three-fold rotational symmetry, we
confirm a vanadium trimerization with $d$-$d$ $\sigma$ bonds. The Knight shift
extracts the large Van-Vleck orbital susceptibility, $\chi^{\rm VV} = 3.6
\times 10^{-4}$, in a paramagnetic state above $T_c$, which is comparable to
the spin susceptibility. The results suggest that orbitally induced Peierls
transition in the proximity of the frustrated itinerant state is the dominant
driving force of the trimerization transition.

necessary because of the dramatically different densities and viscosities

melting, sputtering and kinetic energy of the ablated mass. Low entry

with bioinformatics tools and techniques. The signatures of 60 computer viruses

multiply aligned separately to identify conserved regions across different

alignment of all 120 aligned signatures together so that non-conserved regions
were identified prior to input to a number of machine learning techniques.
Differences in length between virus and worm signatures after the first

indicates that representing computer malware signatures as amino acid sequences
followed by alignment leads to greater classification and prediction accuracy.
Our second set of experiments indicates that checking the results of data
mining from artificial virus and worm data against known proteins can lead to
generalizations being made from the domain of naturally occurring proteins to
malware signatures. However, further work is needed to determine the advantages

  Layouts",,,,,"cs.CG cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A rectangular layout $\mathcal{L}$ is a rectangle partitioned into disjoint
smaller rectangles so that no four smaller rectangles meet at the same point.
Rectangular layouts were originally used as floorplans in VLSI design to
represent VLSI chip layouts. More recently, they are used in graph drawing as
rectangular cartograms. In these applications, an area $a(r)$ is assigned to
each rectangle $r$, and the actual area of $r$ in $\mathcal{L}$ is required to
be $a(r)$. Moreover, some applications require that we use combinatorially
equivalent rectangular layouts to represent multiple area assignment functions.
$\mathcal{L}$ is called {\em area-universal} if any area assignment to its
rectangles can be realized by a layout that is combinatorially equivalent to
$\mathcal{L}$.
  A basic question in this area is to determine if a given plane graph $G$ has
an area-universal rectangular layout or not. A fixed-parameter-tractable
algorithm for solving this problem was obtained in \cite{EMSV12}. Their
algorithm takes $O(2^{O(K^2)}n^{O(1)})$ time (where $K$ is the maximum number
of degree 4 vertices in any minimal separation component), which is exponential
time in general case. It is an open problem to find a true polynomial time
algorithm for solving this problem. In this paper, we describe such a
polynomial time algorithm.
  This paper has been revised for many versions. For previous versions,
referrers who are familiar with area-universal rectangular layouts always have
the same doubt for the correctness of our algorithm. They doubt that our
algorithm will give a wrong output which combine two \emph{conflicting} REL
together.
  In the current version, we realize this critical issue for the previous
algorithm and we will provide two subsections 5.3 and 5.4 to solve this issue.

approach of the density functional theory (DFT) and the dynamical mean field
theory (DMFT). Low temperature (T) spec-tral functions show dispersive KR
states, similarly to the recent experimental observation. During the evolution
from the nonf conduction band state at high T to the dispersive KR band state
at low T, which have topologically different band shapes, we have found the
existence of kinks in the spectral function near EF . The observation of kink
is clearly in correspondence with the multiple temperature scale of the
formation of the KR band. We suggest that the detailed analysis on the abrupt
change of electron velocity and the scattering rate near the Fermi level will
provide crucial information for the heavy fermion system.

against cosmological models is prone to subtle caveats that can easily lead to
misinterpretations. Our analysis reveals full statistical consistency between
~5000 galaxy rotations, observed in line-of-sight projection, and predictions
based on the standard cosmological model (LCDM) at the mass-resolution of the
Millennium simulation (HI line-based circular velocities above ~50 km/s).
Explicitly, the HI linewidths in the HI Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS) are
found consistent with those in S3-SAX, a post-processed semi-analytic model for
the Millennium simulation. Previously found anomalies in the VF can be
plausibly attributed to (1) the mass-limit of the Millennium simulation, (2)
confused sources in HIPASS, (3) inaccurate inclination measurements for
optically faint sources, and (4) the non-detectability of gas-poor early-type
galaxies. These issues can be bypassed by comparing observations and models
using linewidth source counts rather than VFs. We investigate if and how well
such source counts can constrain the temperature of DM.

crucial to better forecast disasters and limit their consequences. However,
almost all the previous phenomenological studies involved only a long-ranged
autocorrelation function, or disregarded the multi-scaling properties induced
by potential higher order dependencies. Consequently, they missed the facts
that non-linear dependences do impact both the statistics and dynamics of
recurrence times, and that scaling arguments for the unconditional distribution
may not be applicable. We argue that copulas is the correct model-free
framework to study non-linear dependencies in time series and related concepts

recurrence intervals is very much system specific, and cannot actually benefit
from universal features, in contrast to the previous claims. This has important
implications in epilepsy prognosis and financial risk management applications.

observed at RHIC was weak and hence never decisive in constraining models,
there is now a strong and non-trivial P_T dependence observed at the LHC. This

effect of anisotropy in the surface tension, and show that in the limit of
strong anisotropy $\Delta G(V)$ once more develops a term logarithmic on $V$,

orbital-angular-momentum pairing states of the superconductor, exemplifying
topologically nontrivial states which are gapped and gapless in the bulk,
respectively. Utilizing a quasiclassical scattering theory, we derive an
expression for the interface current in terms of Andreev reflection
coefficients. Performing a systematic study of the current, we find stark
qualitative differences between the gapped and gapless superconductors, which
reflect the very different underlying topological properties. For the fully
gapped superconductor, there is a sharp drop in the zero-temperature current as
the system is tuned from a topologically nontrivial to a trivial phase. We
explain this in terms of the sudden disappearance of the contribution to the
current from the subgap edge states at the topological transition. The current
in the gapless superconductor is characterized by a dramatic enhancement at low
temperatures, and exhibits a singular dependence on the exchange-field strength
in the ferromagnetic metal at zero temperature. This is caused by the energy
shift of the strongly spin-polarized nondegenerate zero-energy flat bands due
to their coupling to the exchange field. We argue that the interface current
provides a novel test of the topology of the superconductor, and discuss
prospects for the experimental verification of our predictions.

affected by dynamic effects. Based on the resulting structures and under the
assumptions of chemical equilibrium as well as LTE, we computed synthetic
spectra and synthetic broad-band photometry (Johnson-Cousins-Glass). A set of
five representative models with different stellar parameters describes a
sequence from less to more evolved objects with steadily increasing mass-loss
rates. This allowed us to study the significant influence of circumstellar dust
on the spectral energy distributions and the (amplitudes of) lightcurves in
different filters. We tested the photometric properties (mean NIR magnitudes,
colours, and amplitudes) and other characteristics of the models (mass-loss
rates, periods, and bolometric corrections) by comparing these with the
corresponding observational data adopted from the literature. Using different
kinds of diagrams we illustrate where the models are located in a supposed
evolutionary sequence defined by observed C-type Mira samples. Based on
comparisons of galactic targets with empirical relations derived for C stars in
the Large Magellanic Cloud we discuss the relevance of metallicity and excess
carbon (C--O) for the development of dust-driven winds. Having investigated the
dynamic model atmospheres from different (mainly photometric) perspectives, we
conclude that our modelling approach (meaning the combination of numerical
method and a suitable choice of model parameters) is able to describe C-rich
long-period variables over a wide range of mass-loss rates, i.e., from
moderately pulsating objects without any dusty wind to highly dust-enshrouded

coherent population trapping (CPT) resonances in buffer gas-filled vapor cells
with push-pull optical pumping (PPOP) on Cs D1 line. We point out that the
push-pull interaction scheme is identical to the so-called lin per lin
polarization scheme. Expressions of the relevant dark states, as well as of
absorption, are reported. The experimental setup is based on the combination of
a distributed feedback (DFB) diode laser, a pigtailed intensity Mach-Zehnder
electro-optic modulator (MZ EOM) for optical sidebands generation and a
Michelson-like interferometer. A microwave technique to stabilize the transfer
function operating point of the MZ EOM is implemented for proper operation. A
CPT resonance contrast as high as 78% is reported in a cm-scale cell for the
magnetic-field insensitive clock transition. The impact of the laser intensity
on the CPT clock signal key parameters (linewidth - contrast -
linewidth/contrast ratio) is reported for three different cells with various
dimensions and buffer gas contents. The potential of the PPOP technique for the
development of high-performance atomic vapor cell clocks is discussed.

both flat and curved geometries. We analyzed two classes of models. In the
isotropic models the non-universal parameters are uniform along the surface,
whereas in the anisotropic growth they vary. In the latter case, that produces
curved surfaces, the statistics must be computed independently along fixed
directions. The ansatz h = v t + (\Gamma t)^{1/3} \chi + \eta, where \chi is a
Tracy-Widom (geometry-dependent) distribution and \eta is a time-independent
correction, is probed. Our numerical analysis shows that the non-universal
parameter \Gamma determined through the first cumulant leads to a very good
accordance with the extended KPZ ansatz for all investigated models in contrast
with the estimates of \Gamma obtained from higher order cumulants that indicate
a violation of the generalized ansatz for some of the studied models. We
associate the discrepancies to corrections of unknown nature, which hampers an
accurate estimation of \Gamma at finite times. The discrepancies in \Gamma via
different approaches are relatively small but sufficient to modify the scaling
law t^{-1/3} that characterize the finite-time corrections due to \eta. Among
the investigated models, we have revisited an off-lattice Eden model that
supposedly disobeyed the shift in the mean scaling as t^{-1/3} and showed that
there is a crossover to the expected regime. We have found model-dependent
(non-universal) corrections for cumulants of order n > 1. All investigated
models are consistent with a further term of order t^{-1/3} in the KPZ ansatz.

chains) is the computation of {\em termination probabilities}, and computing
these probabilities in turn boils down to computing the {\em least fixed point}
(LFP) solution of a corresponding {\em monotone polynomial system} (MPS) of
equations, denoted x=P(x).
  It was shown by Etessami & Yannakakis that a decomposed variant of Newton's
method converges monotonically to the LFP solution for any MPS that has a
non-negative solution. Subsequently, Esparza, Kiefer, & Luttenberger obtained
upper bounds on the convergence rate of Newton's method for certain classes of
MPSs. More recently, better upper bounds have been obtained for special classes
of MPSs. However, prior to this paper, for arbitrary (not necessarily
strongly-connected) MPSs, no upper bounds at all were known on the convergence
rate of Newton's method as a function of the encoding size |P| of the input
MPS, x=P(x).
  In this paper we provide worst-case upper bounds, as a function of both the
input encoding size |P|, and epsilon > 0, on the number of iterations required
for decomposed Newton's method (even with rounding) to converge within additive
error epsilon > 0 of q^*, for any MPS with LFP solution q^*. Our upper bounds
are essentially optimal in terms of several important parameters.
  Using our upper bounds, and building on prior work, we obtain the first
P-time algorithm (in the standard Turing model of computation) for quantitative
model checking, to within desired precision, of discrete-time QBDs and
(equivalently) probabilistic 1-counter automata, with respect to any (fixed)

create the initial beam that is accelerated by the rest of the machine. This
paper will introduce the many methods of creating a beam for high-power hadron
accelerators. A brief introduction to some of the relevant concepts of plasma
physics and beam formation is given. The different types of ion source used in
accelerators today are examined. Positive ion sources for producing H+ ions and
multiply charged heavy ions are covered. The physical principles involved with
negative ion production are outlined and different types of negative ion
sources are described. Cutting edge ion source technology and the techniques
used to develop sources for the next generation of accelerators are discussed.

preferable adsorption sites are found to be valley, bridge, valley and hill

previously constructed wormholes, the notion of the phantom energy was used in
a more extended sense than in cosmology, where the phantom energy is considered
a homogeneously distributed fluid. Specifically, for some static wormhole

anisotropic fluid, with radial and lateral pressures satisfying the relations
$p_{r}/\rho<-1$ and $p_{_l} \neq p_r$, respectively. In this paper we construct

function and evolution of microbial communities. The estimation of microbial
diversity has received renewed attention with the advent of large-scale
metagenomic studies. Here, we consider what the diversity observed in a sample
tells us about the diversity of the community being sampled. First, we argue
that one cannot reliably estimate the absolute and relative number of microbial
species present in a community without making unsupported assumptions about
species abundance distributions. The reason for this is that sample data do not
contain information about the number of rare species in the tail of species
abundance distributions. We illustrate the difficulty in comparing species
richness estimates by applying Chao's estimator of species richness to a set of
in silico communities: they are ranked incorrectly in the presence of large
numbers of rare species. Next, we extend our analysis to a general family of
diversity metrics (""Hill diversities""), and construct lower and upper estimates
of diversity values consistent with the sample data. The theory generalizes
Chao's estimator, which we retrieve as the lower estimate of species richness.
We show that Shannon and Simpson diversity can be robustly estimated for the in
silico communities. We analyze nine metagenomic data sets from a wide range of
environments, and show that our findings are relevant for empirically-sampled
communities. Hence, we recommend the use of Shannon and Simpson diversity
rather than species richness in efforts to quantify and compare microbial
diversity.

Accepted for publication in A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201220536",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We show that condensation is an efficient particle growth mechanism, leading
to growth beyond decimeter-sized pebbles close to an ice line in protoplanetary
discs. As coagulation of dust particles is frustrated by bouncing and
fragmentation, condensation could be a complementary, or even dominant, growth
mode in the early stages of planet formation. Ice particles diffuse across the
ice line and sublimate, and vapour diffusing back across the ice line
recondenses onto already existing particles, causing them to grow. We develop a
numerical model of the dynamical behaviour of ice particles close to the water
ice line, approximately 3 AU from the host star. Particles move with the
turbulent gas, modelled as a random walk. They also sediment towards the
midplane and drift radially towards the central star. Condensation and
sublimation are calculated using a Monte Carlo approach. Our results indicate
that, with a turbulent alpha-value of 0.01, growth from millimeter to at least
decimeter-sized pebbles is possible on a time scale of 1000 years. We find that
particle growth is dominated by ice and vapour transport across the radial ice
line, with growth due to transport across the atmospheric ice line being
negligible. Ice particles mix outwards by turbulent diffusion, leading to net
growth across the entire cold region. The resulting particles are large enough
to be sensitive to concentration by streaming instabilities, and in pressure
bumps and vortices, which can cause further growth into planetesimals. In our
model, particles are considered to be homogeneous ice particles. Taking into
account the more realistic composition of ice condensed onto rocky ice nuclei
might affect the growth time scales, by release of refractory ice nuclei after
sublimation. We also ignore sticking and fragmentation in particle collisions.
These effects will be the subject of future investigations.

the connection between physics and professional matters is quite explicit.
Students often feel physics as boring and useless, i.e. very far from their
interests. In these schools it is almost always required the physics lab, but
it does not always exist. The physics teachers of a local Agricultural
Technical Institute asked us to realize a learning path in laboratory for their

from thermal equilibrium to a full understanding of the measures made with the

calorimetry and state transitions connecting them to the functioning of an
instrument that students use in their professional career. The feedback of

compression was caused by a very dense, cold, and fast high-beta magnetosheath
plasma flow, a so-called plasma jet, whose kinetic energy was approximately
three times higher than the energy of the incident solar wind. The plasma jet
resulted in the effective penetration of the magnetosheath plasma inside the

sequence generated a tripolar magnetic pulse 'decrease-peak-decrease' (DPD)

descent methods. We consider a typical multiscale registration setting where
the global 2-D translation between a pair of images is estimated by smoothing
the images and minimizing the distance between them with gradient descent. Our
study particularly concentrates on the effect of noise and low-pass filtering
on the alignment accuracy. We adopt an analytic representation for images and
analyze the well-behavedness of the image distance function by estimating the
neighborhood of translations for which it is free of undesired local minima.
This corresponds to the neighborhood of translation vectors that are correctly
computable with a simple gradient descent minimization. We show that the area
of this neighborhood increases at least quadratically with the smoothing filter
size, which justifies the use of a smoothing step in image registration with
local optimizers such as gradient descent. We then examine the effect of noise
on the alignment accuracy and derive an upper bound for the alignment error in
terms of the noise properties and filter size. Our main finding is that the
error increases at a rate that is at least linear with respect to the filter
size. Therefore, smoothing improves the well-behavedness of the distance
function; however, this comes at the cost of amplifying the alignment error in
noisy settings. Our results provide a mathematical insight about why
hierarchical techniques are effective in image registration, suggesting that
the multiscale coarse-to-fine alignment strategy of these techniques is very
suitable from the perspective of the trade-off between the well-behavedness of
the objective function and the registration accuracy. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first such study for descent-based image registration.

client, who does not have enough quantum technologies at her disposal, can
delegate her quantum computation to a server, who has a fully-fledged quantum
computer, in such a way that the server cannot learn anything about client's
input, output, and program. If the client interacts with only a single server,
the client has to have some minimum quantum power, such as the ability of
emitting randomly rotated single-qubit states or the ability of measuring
states. If the client interacts with two servers who share Bell pairs but
cannot communicate with each other, the client can be completely classical. For
such a double-server scheme, two servers have to share clean Bell pairs, and
therefore the entanglement distillation is necessary in a realistic noisy
environment. In this paper, we show that it is possible to perform entanglement
distillation in the double-server scheme without degrading the security of the
blind quantum computing.

and a composition which are rather temperature independent, while increasing R
simply increases the number of these clusters.

theories, investigating mathematical and physical properties and, more
specifically, the feature of viable and realistic models able to reproduce the
dark energy epoch and the early-time inflation. We will discuss the black hole
solutions in generalized theories of gravity: it is of fundamental interest to
understand how properties and laws of black holes in General Relativity can be
addressed in the framework of modified theories. In particular, we will discuss
the energy issue and the possibility to derive the First Law of thermodynamics
from the field equations. Then, in the analysis of cosmological solutions, we
will pay a particular attention to the occurrence of finite-time future
singularities and to the possibility to avoid them in $\mathcal
F(R,G)$-gravity. Furthermore, realistic models of $F(R)$-gravity will be
analyzed in the detail. A general feature occurring in matter era will be
shown, namely the high derivatives of Hubble parameter may be influenced by the
high frequency oscillation of the dark energy and some correction term is
required in order to stabilize the theory at high redshift. The inflationary
scenario is also carefully analyzed and an unified description of the universe
is risen. In the final part of the work, we will have a look at the last
developments in modified gravity, namely we will investigate cosmological and
black hole solutions in a covariant field theory of gravity and we will
introduce the extended ""teleparallel"" $F(T)$-gravity theories. A nice
application to the dark matter problem will be presented.

product of nonnegative matrices, and the almost sure rank one property of its

that at least one of the $A(k)$ is not diagonal, the normalized columns of the
product matrix $P_n=A(\omega_1)\dots A(\omega_n)$ converge almost surely (for
the product probability) with an exponential rate of convergence if and only if
the Lyapunov exponents are almost surely distinct. If this condition is
satisfied, given a nonnegative column vector $V$ the column vector
$\frac{P_nV}{\Vert P_nV\Vert}$ also converges almost surely with an exponential
rate of convergence. On the other hand if we assume only that at least one of

$ad\ne0$, nor the form $\begin{pmatrix}0&b\\d&0\end{pmatrix}$, $bc\ne0$, the

advance of atoms' outer s electrons through the nuclei of neighbor atoms in a
solid. The necessary progression of holes in the opposite direction has the
electric and magnetic effect as if two electrons were advancing instead of each
actual one. Superconductivity ceases when the associated lateral oscillation of
the outer s electrons extends between neighbor atoms. If such overswing occurs
already at T = 0, then the material is a normal conductor. Otherwise, lateral
overswing can be caused by lattice vibrations at a critical temperature Tc or
by a critical magnetic field Bc. Lateral electron oscillations are reduced -
and Tc is increased - when the atoms of the outer s electrons are squeezed, be
it in the bulk crystal, in a thin film, or under external pressure on the
sample. The model is applied to alkali metals and alkali-doped fullerenes.
Aluminum serves as an example of a simple metal with superconductivity.
Application of the model to transition metals, intertransitional alloys and
compounds of transition metals with other elements sheds light on the pattern
of their critical temperature. More examples of the squeeze effect are provided
by the superconductivity of PdH, MgB2, borocarbides, ferropnictides, and
organic charge-transfer salts. The model also provides the superconduction
mechanism in the oxide superconductors, exemplified by YBa2Cu3O7. Finally the
model suggests which steps to take in order to reach superconductivity at room
temperature and above.

  self-organization","28 pages, 1 figure",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work an extremal principle driving the far from equilibrium evolution
of a system of structureless particles is derived by using the stochastic
quantum hydrodynamic analogy. For a classical phase (i.e., the quantum
correlations decay on a distance smaller than the mean inter-molecular
distance) the far from equilibrium kinetic equation can be cast in the form of
a Fokker-Plank equation whose phase space velocity vector maximizes the
dissipation of the energy-type function, named here, stochastic free energy.
Near equilibrium the maximum stochastic free energy dissipation is shown to be
compatible with the Prigogine s principle of minimum entropy production.
Moreover, in the case of elastic molecular collisions and in absence of
chemical reactions, in quasi-isothermal far from equilibrium states, the theory
shows that the maximum stochastic free energy dissipation reduces to the
maximum free energy dissipation. Following the tendency to reach the highest
rate of stochastic free energy dissipation, the system transition to states
with higher free energy can happen. Given that in incompressible ordinary
fluids such an increase of free energy is almost given by a decrease of
entropy, the matter self-organization becomes possible. When chemical reactions
or relevant thermal gradients are present, the theory highlights that the
Sawada enunciation of maximum free energy dissipation can be violated. The
proposed model depicts the Prigogine s principle of minimum entropy production
near-equilibrium and the far from equilibrium Sawada s principle of maximum
energy dissipation as two complementary principia of a unique theory where the
latter one is a particular case of the more general one of maximum stochastic
free energy dissipation.

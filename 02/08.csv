architecture. The architecture consists of two components, an aperture assembly
and a sensor. No lens is used. The aperture assembly consists of a two
dimensional array of aperture elements. The transmittance of each aperture
element is independently controllable. The sensor is a single detection
element, such as a single photo-conductive cell. Each aperture element together
with the sensor defines a cone of a bundle of rays, and the cones of the
aperture assembly define the pixels of an image. Each pixel value of an image
is the integration of the bundle of rays in a cone. The sensor is used for
taking compressive measurements. Each measurement is the integration of rays in
the cones modulated by the transmittance of the aperture elements. A
compressive sensing matrix is implemented by adjusting the transmittance of the
individual aperture elements according to the values of the sensing matrix. The
proposed architecture is simple and reliable because no lens is used.
Furthermore, the sharpness of an image from our device is only limited by the
resolution of the aperture assembly, but not affected by blurring due to
defocus. The architecture can be used for capturing images of visible lights,
and other spectra such as infrared, or millimeter waves. Such devices may be
used in surveillance applications for detecting anomalies or extracting
features such as speed of moving objects. Multiple sensors may be used with a
single aperture assembly to capture multi-view images simultaneously. A
prototype was built by using a LCD panel and a photoelectric sensor for
capturing images of visible spectrum.

by targeted searches of unidentified gamma-ray sources found by the Fermi
Gamma-Ray Space Telescope. A large fraction of these millisecond pulsars are in
compact binaries with low-mass companions. These systems often show eclipses of
the pulsar signal and are commonly known as black widows and redbacks because
the pulsar is gradually destroying its companion. In this paper, we report on
the optical discovery of four strongly irradiated millisecond pulsar
companions. All four sources show modulations of their color and luminosity at
the known orbital periods from radio timing. Light curve modelling of our
exploratory data shows that the equilibrium temperature reached on the
companion's dayside with respect to their nightside is consistent with about
10-30% of the available spin-down energy from the pulsar being reprocessed to
increase the companion's dayside temperature. This value compares well with the
range observed in other irradiated pulsar binaries and offers insights about
the energetics of the pulsar wind and the production of gamma-ray emission. In
addition, this provides a simple way of estimating the brightness of irradiated
pulsar companions given the pulsar spin-down luminosity. Our analysis also
suggests that two of the four new irradiated pulsar companions are only
partially filling their Roche lobe. Some of these sources are relatively bright
and represent good targets for spectroscopic follow-up. These measurements
could enable, among other things, mass determination of the neutron stars in
these systems.

38 were studies of twin pairs, 3 were studies of twins and non-twin siblings,
and 1 was a study of adoptees. These studies provided n = 89 heritability (h2)
effect size estimates from a total of 94,517 sibling pairs who ranged in age
from 1.5 to 18 years; studies provided data for 29 moderators (predictors). We
employed a random-effects meta-analysis model to achieve three goals: (a)
perform statistical inference of the overall heritability distribution in the
underlying population of studies, (b) identify significant study level
moderators (predictors) of heritability, and (c) examine how the heritability
distribution varied as a function of age and type of informant, particularly in
longitudinal research. The meta-analysis indicated a bimodal overall
heritability distribution, indicating two clusters of moderate and high
heritability values, respectively; identified four moderators that predicted
significant changes in mean heritability; and indicated differential patterns
of median h2 and variance (interquartile ranges) across informants and ages. We
argue for a cross-perspective, cross-setting model for selecting informants in
behavioral genetic research, that is flexible and sensitive to changes in
antisocial behavior over time.

random planar graph. As a particular case, that model yields tessellations with
only T-vertices (T-tessellations). Using a similar approach involving Poisson
lines, a new model of random T-tessellations is proposed. Campbell measures,
Papangelou kernels and Georgii-Nguyen-Zessin formulae are translated from point
process theory to random T-tessellations. It is shown that the new model shows
properties similar to the Poisson point process and can therefore be considered
as a completely random T-tessellation. Gibbs variants are introduced leading to
models of random T-tessellations where selected features are controlled. Gibbs
random T-tessellations are expected to better represent observed tessellations.
As numerical experiments are a key tool for investigating Gibbs models, we
derive a simulation algorithm of the Metropolis-Hastings-Green family.

the rest mass of a particle is some kind of energy. This energy is generally
referred to as ""rest energy"", since the particle is believed to be at rest.
This paper proposes a new interpretation to the term mc^2. Observing the
similarity between the term mc^2 and the kinetic energy term mv^2/2, we propose
to interpret mc^2 as being one term of kinetic energy. In other words we
propose that, in the called ""rest frame"", the massive particles are not really
at rest, but they are doing a special kind of motion at the light speed c. In
this interpretation the ""mass"" is not an intrinsic property of the particle.
The ""mass"" is simply the kinetic energy associated with this special kind of
motion. The more important consequence of this hypothesis is that the term
mc^2, present in the relativistic Hamiltonian, must be rewritten as: mc^2 =>
p_0 c, where p_0 = mc is the modulus of the instantaneous linear moment
\vec{p}_0 associated with the special motion. We analyse a physical scenario in
which this special motion is a Microscopic Orbital Circular Motion (MOCM). The
characteristic length scale of the MOCM is of the order of the Compton

magnetohydrodynamics (CRMHD) model are carried out by means of the
Energy-Casimir (EC) method. Stability results are compared with those obtained
for ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) from the classical {\delta}W criterion. An
identification of the terms in the second variation of the free energy
functional for CRMHD with those of {\delta}W is made: two destabilizing effects
present for CRMHD turn out to correspond to the kink and interchange
instabilities in usual MHD, while the stabilizing roles of field line bending
and compressibility are also identified in the reduced model. Also, using the
EC method, stability conditions in the presence of toroidal flow are obtained.
A formal analogy between CRMHD and a reduced incompressible model for
magnetized rotating disks, due to Julien and Knobloch [EAS Pub. Series, 21, 81
(2006)], is discovered. In light of this analogy, energy stability analysis
shows that the condition for magnetorotational instability (MRI) for the latter
model, corresponds to the condition for interchange instability in CRMHD, with
the Coriolis term and shear velocity playing the roles of the curvature term
and pressure gradient, respectively. Using the EC method, stability conditions
for the rotating disk model, for a large class of equilibria with possible
non-uniform magnetic fields, are obtained. In particular, this shows it is
possible for the MRI system to undergo, in addition to the MRI, another
instability that is analogous to the kink instability. For vanishing magnetic
field, the Rayleigh hydrodynamical stability condition is recovered.

the transforms are singular and involve terms proportional to the Dirac delta
function. Our approach makes use of the Rayleigh expansion of exp(i p.r) in
terms of spherical Bessel functions, and we study a number of integrals,
including singular integrals, involving a power of the independent variable
times a spherical Bessel function. We work through several examples of
three-dimensional Fourier transforms using our approach and show how to derive
a number of identities involving multiple derivatives of 1/r, 1/r^2, and
delta(\vec r).

correlation with charged particles at RHIC are shown, including the absence of
a low pT (thermal) photon enhancement in d+Au collisions. Attempts to

fading IC with partial Channel State Information at the Transmitters (CSIT)
where each transmitter is equipped with an arbitrary deterministic function of
the channel state (this model yields a full control over how much state
information is available). One of the main challenges in the analysis of fading
networks, specifically multi-receiver networks including fading ICs, is to
obtain efficient capacity outer bounds. In this paper, a novel capacity outer
bound is established for the two-user ergodic fading IC. For this purpose, by a
subtle combination of broadcast channel techniques (i.e., manipulating mutual
information functions composed of vector random variables by Csiszar-Korner
identity) and genie-aided techniques, first a single-letter outer bound
characterized by mutual information functions including some auxiliary random
variables is derived. Then, by novel arguments the derived bound is optimized
over its auxiliaries only using the entropy power inequality. Besides being
well-described, our outer bound is efficient from several aspects.
Specifically, it is optimal for the fading IC with uniformly strong
interference. Also, it is sum-rate optimal for the channel with uniformly mixed
interference. More importantly, it is proved that when each transmitter has
access to any amount of CSIT that includes the interference to noise ratio of
its non-corresponding receiver, the outer bound differs by no more than one bit
from the achievable rate region given by Han-Kobayashi scheme. This result is
viewed as a natural generalization of the ETW to within one bit capacity result
for the static channel to the wireless ergodic fading case.

capacity region for the two-user Interference Channel (IC). In this paper, new
results are derived for this channel. As a first result, a noisy interference
regime is given for the general IC where the sum-rate capacity is achieved by
treating interference as noise at the receivers. To obtain this result, a
single-letter outer bound in terms of some auxiliary random variables is first
established for the sum-rate capacity of the general IC and then those
conditions under which this outer bound is reduced to the achievable sum-rate
given by the simple treating interference as noise strategy are specified. The
main benefit of this approach is that it is applicable for any two-user IC
(potentially non-Gaussian). For the special case of Gaussian channel, our
result is reduced to the noisy interference regime that was previously
obtained. Next, some results are given on the Han-Kobayashi (HK) achievable
rate region. The evaluation of this rate region is in general difficult. In
this paper, a simple characterization of the HK rate region is derived for some
special cases, specifically, for a novel very weak interference regime. As a
remarkable characteristic, it is shown that for this very weak interference
regime, the achievable sum-rate due to the HK region is identical to the one
given by the simple treating interference as noise strategy.

portion of the domain boundary which is similar to the degeneracy of a model
linear operator identified by Daskalopoulos and Hamilton (1998) in their study
of the porous medium equation or the degeneracy of the Heston operator (1993)
in mathematical finance. Existence of a solution to the Dirichlet problem on a
half-ball, where the operator becomes degenerate on the flat boundary and a
Dirichlet condition is only imposed on the spherical boundary, provides the key
additional ingredient required for our Perron method. The solution to the
Dirichlet problem on the half-ball can be converted to a Dirichlet problem on
an infinite slab via a suitable diffeomorphism which becomes holomorphic in
dimension two. The required Schauder regularity theory and existence of a
solution to the Dirichlet problem on the slab can nevertheless be obtained
using previous work of the author and C. Pop [arXiv:1210.6727]. Our Perron
method relies on weak and strong maximum principles for degenerate-elliptic

investigated, but this dependence does not seem as strong as the metallicity
dependence. Even for metallicity, however, the exact form of the correlation
has not been established. In this paper, we test several scenarios for
describing the frequency of giant planets as a function of its host parameters.
We perform this test on two volume-limited samples (from CORALIE and HARPS). By
using a Bayesian analysis, we quantitatively compared the different scenarios.
We confirm that giant planet frequency is indeed a function of metallicity.
However, there is no statistical difference between a constant or an
exponential function for stars with subsolar metallicities contrary to what has
been previously stated in the literature. The dependence on stellar mass could
neither be confirmed nor be discarded.

While natural molecular motors have evolved towards very high efficiency, it
remains a major challenge to develop efficient designs for man-made molecular
motors. Inspired by biological motor proteins like kinesin and myosin,
molecular spiders comprise a body and several legs. The legs walk on a lattice
that is coated with substrate which can be cleaved catalytically. We propose a
novel molecular spider design in which n spiders form a team. Our theoretical
considerations show that coupling several spiders together alters the dynamics
of the resulting team significantly. Although spiders operate at a scale where
diffusion is dominant, spider teams can be tuned to behave nearly ballistic,
which results in fast and predictable motion. Based on the separation of time
scales of substrate and product dwell times, we develop a theory which utilises
equivalence classes to coarse-grain the micro-state space. In addition, we
calculate diffusion coefficients of the spider teams, employing a mapping of an
n-spider team to an n-dimensional random walker on a confined lattice. We
validate these results with Monte Carlo simulations and predict optimal
parameters of the molecular spider team architecture which makes their motion
most directed and maximally predictable.

type and similar energies but separated spatially to yield a high efficiency.
We present three methods for phase-space implementation that have been
integrated into the most recent version of the GPU-based Monte Carlo
radiotherapy dose calculation package gDPM v3.0. The first method is to
sequentially read particles from a patient-dependent phase-space and sort them
on-the-fly based on particle type and energy. The second method supplements
this with a simple secondary collimator model and fluence map implementation so
that patient-independent phase-space sources can be used. Finally, as the third
method (called the phase-space-let, or PSL, method) we introduce a novel
strategy to pre-process patient-independent phase-spaces and bin particles by
type, energy and position. Position bins located outside a rectangular region
of interest enclosing the treatment field are ignored, substantially decreasing
simulation time. The three methods were validated in absolute dose against
BEAMnrc/DOSXYZnrc and compared using gamma-index tests (2%/2mm above the 10%
isodose). It was found that the PSL method has the optimal balance between
accuracy and efficiency and thus is used as the default method in gDPM v3.0.
Using the PSL method, open fields of 4x4, 10x10 and 30x30 cm2 in water resulted
in gamma passing rates of 99.96%, 99.92% and 98.66%, respectively. Relative
output factors agreed within 1%. An IMRT patient plan using the PSL method

distinguished geometrically from those of scalars through the parity of the

SMBHs ever closer. In a static spherical galaxy model, the binary stalls at a
separation of about a parsec after ejecting all the stars in its loss cone --
this is the well-known final parsec problem. Earlier work has shown that the
centrophilic orbits in triaxial galaxy models are key in refilling the loss

the evolution of binary SMBHs has never been explored in axisymmetric galaxies,
so it is not clear if the final parsec problem persists in these systems. Here
we use a suite of direct N-body simulations to follow SMBH binary evolution in

pulsating DA (hydrogen atmosphere) white dwarf (WD), observed in the 292.9 s

exceeds by more than two orders of magnitude the expected rate from cooling
alone for this class of slow and simply evolving pulsating WDs. This result
indicates the presence of an additional timescale for period evolution in these
pulsating objects. We also measure the rates of period change of nonlinear
combination frequencies and show that they share the evolutionary
characteristics of their parent modes, confirming that these combination
frequencies are not independent modes but rather artifacts of some nonlinear

electronic systems. The simplest system in which interactions can play an
interesting role is that of two electrons on a string. In the presence of
strong interactions the two electrons are predicted to form a Wigner molecule,
separating to the ends of the string due to their mutual repulsion. This
spatial structure is believed to be clearly imprinted on the energy spectrum,
yet to date a direct measurement of such a spectrum in a controllable
one-dimensional setting is still missing. Here we use an ultra-clean suspended
carbon nanotube to realize this system in a tunable potential. Using tunneling
spectroscopy we measure the excitation spectra of two interacting carriers,
electrons or holes, and identify seven low-energy states characterized by their
spin and isospin quantum numbers. These states fall into two multiplets
according to their exchange symmetries. The formation of a strongly-interacting
Wigner molecule is evident from the small energy splitting measured between the
two multiplets, that is quenched by an order of magnitude compared to the
non-interacting value. Our ability to tune the two-electron state in space and
to study it for both electrons and holes provides an unambiguous demonstration
of the fundamental Wigner molecule state.

metallicity of $\sigma = 0.38 \pm 0.04$ dex, similar to the mean and spread
observed in the massive dSph Fornax and the Small Magellanic Cloud. Thus,
despite its isolated environment the global metallicity still follows
expectations for WLM's mass and its global chemical evolution is similar to
other nearby luminous dwarf galaxies (gas-rich or gas-poor). The data also show
a radial gradient in [Fe/H] of $\rm{d[Fe/H]/dr_{c}} = -0.04 \pm 0.04$ dex
$\rm{r_{c}^{-1}}$, which is flatter than that seen in the unbiased and
spatially extended surveys of dSphs. Comparison of the spatial distribution of
[Fe/H] in WLM, the Magellanic Clouds, and a sample of Local Group dSphs, shows
an apparent dichotomy in the sense that the dIrrs have statistically flatter
radial [Fe/H] gradients than the low angular momentum dSphs. The correlation
between angular momentum and radial metallicity gradient is further supported
when considering the Local Group dEs. This chemodynamic relationship offers a
new and useful constraint for environment driven dwarf galaxy evolution models

our findings with directly-imaged, wide-orbit (>= 50 AU) companions known
to-date. The viability of the disk fragmentation scenario for the formation of
wide-orbit companions in protostellar disks around (sub-)solar mass stars was
investigated. Methods: We used numerical hydrodynamics simulations of disk
formation and evolution with an accurate treatment of disk thermodynamics. The
use of the thin-disk limit allowed us to probe the long-term evolution of
protostellar disks. We focused on models that produced wide-orbit GP/BD
embryos, which opened a gap in the disk and showed radial migration timescales
similar to or longer than the typical disk lifetime. Results: While disk
fragmentation was seen in the majority of our models, only 6 models out of 60
revealed the formation of quasi-stable, wide-orbit GP/BD embryos. Disk
fragmentation produced GP/BD embryos with masses in the 3.5-43 M_J range,
covering the whole mass spectrum of directly-imaged, wide-orbit companions to
(sub-)solar mass stars. On the other hand, our modelling failed to produce
embryos on orbital distances <= 170 AU, whereas several directly-imaged
companions were found at smaller orbits down to a few AU. Disk fragmentation
also failed to produce wide-orbit companions around stars with mass <= 0.7
Msun, in disagreement with observations. Conclusions: Disk fragmentation is
unlikely to explain the whole observed spectrum of wide-orbit companions to
(sub-)solar-mass stars and other formation mechanisms, e.g., dynamical
scattering of closely-packed companions onto wide orbits, should be invoked to
account for companions at orbital distance from a few tens to \approx 150 AU
and wide-orbit companions with masses of the host star <= 0.7 Msun. (abridged)

ionized interstellar medium that are responsible for the scintillations are
relatively quiescent, with scintillation and scattering resulting from weak
waves propagating along magnetic domain boundary current sheets, which are both
expected from helicity conservation and have been observed in numerical
simulations. The model statistically predicts the spacing and amplitudes of
inverted parabolic arcs seen in Fourier-transformed dynamical spectra of
strongly scintillating pulsars with only 3 parameters. Multi-frequency,
multi-epoch low frequency VLBI observations can quantitatively test this

to precise nanoarcsecond pulsar astrometry, distance measurements, and emission

alternative to a point-to-point MIMO system, when a single receiver is not
equipped with multiple antennas. It is evident that the practicality of CF
cooperation will be greatly enhanced if an efficient source coding technique
can be used at the relay. It is even more desirable that CF cooperation should
not be unduly sensitive to carrier frequency offsets (CFOs). This paper
presents a practical study of these two issues. Firstly, codebook designs of
the Voronoi vector quantization (VQ) and the tree-structure vector quantization
(TSVQ) to enable CF cooperation at the relay are described. A comparison in
terms of the codebook design and encoding complexity is analyzed. It is shown
that the TSVQ is much simpler to design and operate, and can achieve a
favorable performance-complexity tradeoff. Furthermore, this paper demonstrates
that CFO can lead to significant performance degradation for the virtual MIMO

jointly estimate the CFO between the relay and the destination. This approach
is shown to provide a significant performance improvement.

observations is underway since 2006 to monitor these stars and verify their
stability which has to be better than 300 m/s over several years. The

10214 radial velocity measurements have been obtained for the 1420 stars. With
a mean time baseline of 6.35 years, 92.9% of the candidates fulfill a target
stability criterion of 300 m/s. 343 stars are found to be constant at the level
of 100 m/s over 10 years. Comparisons with the catalogues of Nidever et

development of the fluorescence techniques. On the other hand, developing
organisms, e.g. {\em D. melanogaster}, exhibit strikingly precise
spatio-temporal patterns of protein/mRNA concentrations
\cite{gregor07b,manu09a,manu09b,boettiger09}. Those two characteristics of
living organisms are in apparent contradiction: the precise patterns of protein
concentrations are the result of multiple mutually interacting random chemical
reactions. The main question is to establish biochemical mechanisms for
coupling random reactions so that canalization, or fluctuations reduction
instead of amplification, takes place. Here we explore a model for coupling two
stochastic processes where the noise of the combined process can be smaller
than that of the isolated ones. Such a canalization occurs if, and only if,
there is negative covariance between the random variables of the model. Our
results are obtained in the framework of a master equation for a negatively
self-regulated -- or externally regulated -- binary gene and show that the
precise control due to negative self regulation \cite{becskei00} is because it
may generate negative covariance. Our results suggest that negative covariance,
in the coupling of random chemical reactions, is a theoretical mechanism
underlying the precision of developmental processes.

electrons and protons. The astrophysical environment where AGNs and their jets
are found is characterized by large concentrations of both dark matter (DM) and
intra-cluster medium (ICM) gas. As the high-energy jet particles transverse the
DM and the ICM, elastic and inelastic scattering processes generically lead to
the production of final-state photons. As first envisioned by Bloom and Wells
(1998), and as more recently pointed out by us and others, the scattering of
electrons off of DM could lead to a potentially detectable gamma-ray signal,
with the parton-level contribution from protons offering dimmer perspectives.
Recently, Chang et al. argued that taking into account photons from
hadronization and showering, the actual photon flux is substantially increased.
Here, we point out that the proton-jets have to be highly collimated, contrary
to what predicted by simple blob-geometry jet-models sometimes employed in
these studies, otherwise they would produce a very large flux of photons from
inelastic collisions with ICM nucleons, which would outshine by many orders of
magnitude the signal from DM, for almost any reasonable ICM and DM density
profiles.

estimate what we call the dissimilarity probability of a sample, i.e., the
probability of a draw from one distribution not being observed in k draws from
another distribution. We show our estimator of dissimilarity to be a
U-statistic and a uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator of
dissimilarity over the largest appropriate range of k. Furthermore, despite the
non-Markovian nature of our estimator when applied sequentially over k, we show
it converges uniformly in probability to the dissimilarity parameter, and we
present criteria when it is approximately normally distributed and admits a
consistent jackknife estimator of its variance. As proof of concept, we analyze
V35 16S rRNA data to discern between various microbial environments. Other
potential applications concern any situation where dissimilarity of two
discrete distributions may be of interest. For instance, in SELEX experiments,
each urn could represent a random RNA pool and each draw a possible solution to
a particular binding site problem over that pool. The dissimilarity of these
pools is then related to the probability of finding binding site solutions in

massive subhalos. The gravity of a subhalo in a cluster compresses the
surrounding intracluster gas and enhances its X-ray emission. We present a
simple model, which treats subhalos as slow moving and gasless, for computing
this effect. Recent weak lensing measurements by Okabe et al. have determined
masses of ~ 10^13 solar masses for three mass concentrations projected within
300 kpc of the center of the Coma Cluster, two of which are centered on the
giant elliptical galaxies NGC 4889 and NGC 4874. Adopting a smooth spheroidal
beta-model for the gas distribution in the unperturbed cluster, we model the
effect of these subhalos on the X-ray morphology of the Coma Cluster, comparing
our results to Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray data. The agreement between the
models and the X-ray morphology of the central Coma Cluster is striking. With
subhalo parameters from the lensing measurements, the distances of the three
subhalos from the Coma Cluster midplane along our line of sight are all tightly
constrained. Using the model to fit the subhalo masses for NGC 4889 and NGC
4874 gives 9.1 x 10^12 and 7.6 x 10^12 solar masses, respectively, in good
agreement with the lensing masses. These results lend strong support to the
argument that NGC 4889 and NGC 4874 are each associated with a subhalo that
resides near the center of the Coma Cluster. In addition to constraining the
masses and 3-d location of subhalos, the X-ray data show promise as a means of
probing the structure of central subhalos.

This theory modifies the Einstein-Hilbert action through the introduction of a
dynamical scalar field coupled to the Pontryagin density. We here treat this
theory as an effective model, working to leading order in the Chern-Simons
coupling. We first construct isolated neutron star solutions in the
slow-rotation expansion to quadratic order in spin. We find that isolated
neutron stars acquire a scalar dipole charge that corrects its spin angular
momentum to linear order in spin and corrects its mass and quadrupole moment to
quadratic order in spin, as measured by an observer at spatial infinity. We
then consider neutron stars binaries that are widely separated and solve for
their orbital evolution in this modified theory. We find that the evolution of
post-Keplerian parameters is modified, with the rate of periastron advance
being the dominant correction at first post-Newtonian order. We conclude by
applying these results to observed pulsars with the aim to place constraints on
dynamical Chern-Simons gravity. We find that the modifications to the observed
mass are degenerate with the neutron star equation of state, which prevents us
from testing the theory with the inferred mass of the millisecond pulsar
J1614-2230. We also find that the corrections to the post-Keplerian parameters
are too small to be observable today even with data from the double binary
pulsar J0737-3039. Our results suggest that pulsar observations are not
currently capable of constraining dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, and thus,
gravitational-wave observations may be the only path to a stringent constraint
of this theory in the imminent future.

three widely-used NW PCM peration schemes (constant electric field, voltage,
and current) are studied and compared. It is shown that if the device size is
downscaled by a factor of 1/k (k>1), the peration energy (current) will be
reduced by more than k3 (k) times, and the operation speed will be increased by
k2 times. It is also shown that more than 90% of operation energy is wasted as
thermal flux into substrate and electrodes. We predict that, if the wasted
thermal flux is effectively reduced by heat confinement technologies, the
energy consumed per RESET operation can be decreased from about 1 pJ to less
than 100 fJ. It is shown that reducing NW aspect ratio (AR) helps decreasing
PCM energy consumption. It is revealed that cross-cell thermal proximity
disturbance is counter-intuitively alleviated by scaling, leading to a
desirable scaling scenario.

38 Angstrom (12 atomic layers) still shows a band gap and the electrical
conductance is mainly due to electron transport via intra-gap states. If the
ultrathin films are further scaled, the a-GeTe band gap disappears due to
overlap of the two metal induced gap states (MIGS) regions near the TiN
electrodes, leading to sharp increase of a-GeTe conductance and significant
decrease of c-GeTe/a-GeTe conductance ratio. The c-GeTe/a-GeTe conductance
ratio drops below one order of magnitude if the ultrathin films are scaled
below about 33 Angstrom, making it difficult to reliably perform read
operations in thin film based phase change memory devices. This overlap of the
MIGS regions sets up the ultimate scaling limit of phase change memory
technology. Our results suggest that the ultimate scaling limit can be pushed
to even smaller size, by using phase change material (PCM) with larger

exponentially faster than classical computers. Recently, Harrow, Hassidim and
Lloyd proposed a quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations:
given an $N\times{N}$ matrix $A$ and a vector $\vec b$, find the vector $\vec
x$ that satisfies $A\vec x = \vec b$. It has been shown that using the
algorithm one could obtain the solution encoded in a quantum state $|x$ using
$O(\log{N})$ quantum operations, while classical algorithms require at least
O(N) steps. If one is not interested in the solution $\vec{x}$ itself but
certain statistical feature of the solution ${x}|M|x$ ($M$ is some quantum
mechanical operator), the quantum algorithm will be able to achieve exponential
speedup over the best classical algorithm as $N$ grows. Here we report a
proof-of-concept experimental demonstration of the quantum algorithm using a
4-qubit nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum information processor. For all
the three sets of experiments with different choices of $\vec b$, we obtain the
solutions with over 96% fidelity. This experiment is a first implementation of
the algorithm. Because solving linear systems is a common problem in nearly all

equation for an isotropic hyperelastic solid in the presence of initial stress
is derived. This derivation involves invariants that couple the deformation
with the initial stress and in general, for a compressible material, it
requires 10 invariants, reducing to 9 for an incompressible material.
Expressions for the Cauchy and nominal stress tensors in a finitely deformed
configuration are given along with the elasticity tensor and its specialization
to the initially stressed undeformed configuration. The equations governing
infinitesimal motions superimposed on a finite deformation are then used to
study the combined effects of initial stress and finite deformation on the
propagation of homogeneous plane waves in a homogeneously deformed and
initially stressed solid of infinite extent. This general framework allows for
various different specializations, which make contact with earlier works. In
particular, connections with results derived within Biot's classical theory are
highlighted. The general results are also specialized to the case of a small
initial stress and a small pre-deformation, i.e. to the evaluation of the
acoustoelastic effect. Here the formulas derived for the wave speeds cover the
case of a second-order elastic solid without initial stress and subject to a
uniaxial tension [Hughes and Kelly, Phys. Rev. 92 (1953) 1145] and are
consistent with results for an undeformed solid subject to a residual stress
[Man and Lu, J. Elasticity 17 (1987) 159]. These formulas provide a basis for
acoustic evaluation of the second- and third-order elasticity constants and of
the residual stresses. The results are further illustrated in respect of a
prototype model of nonlinear elasticity with initial stress, allowing for both
finite deformation and nonlinear dependence on the initial stress.

diffusion is only a factor of two faster than diffusion in the {\Sigma}5 GB but
significantly faster than diffusion in the general GBs. Both the GBs and the TJ
studied here show a premelting behavior near the bulk melting point, where
their diffusivities converge to the diffusivity of bulk liquid. Although our
results are consistent with the common assumption that TJ diffusion is
generally faster than GB diffusion, the difference between the two

for joint estimation of multiple networks in this nonidentically distributed

We provide an upper bound on the gains that joint estimation offers relative to
separate estimation for each network and empirical results that support and
extend the theory, including an extensive simulation study and an application
to proteomic data from human cancer cell lines. Finally, we describe
approximations that are still more computationally efficient than the exact

optimization problem is solved in distributed fashion using dual decomposition,
it is important to keep the number of iterations in the solution algorithm,
i.e. the amount of communication between subsystems, as small as possible. At
the same time, the number of iterations must be enough to give a feasible
solution to the optimization problem and to guarantee stability of the closed
loop system. In this paper, a stopping condition to the distributed
optimization algorithm that guarantees these properties, is presented. The
stopping condition is based on two theoretical contributions. First, since the
optimization problem is solved using dual decomposition, standard techniques to
prove stability in model predictive control (MPC), i.e. with a terminal cost
and a terminal constraint set that involve all state variables, do not apply.
For the case without a terminal cost or a terminal constraint set, we present a
new method to quantify the control horizon needed to ensure stability and a
prespecified performance. Second, the stopping condition is based on a novel
adaptive constraint tightening approach. Using this adaptive constraint
tightening approach, we guarantee that a primal feasible solution to the
optimization problem is found and that closed loop stability and performance is
obtained. Numerical examples show that the number of iterations needed to
guarantee feasibility of the optimization problem, stability and a prespecified
performance of the closed-loop system can be reduced significantly using the

crystallization is originally starting with the Ni3Nb phase formation. It was
shown that surface crystallization drastically differs from the bulk
crystallization due to the possible surface reconstruction. The mechanism of

the local metastable (3x3)-Ni(111) surface phase formation. The possibility of
different surface nano-structures development by the annealing of the
originally glassy alloy in ultra high vacuum at the temperature lower, than the
crystallization temperature was shown. The increase of mean square surface
roughness parameter Rq while moving from glassy to fully crystallized state can
be caused by concurrent growth of Ni3Nb and Ni6Nb7 bulk phases. The simple
empirical model for the estimation of Ni63.5Nb36.5 cluster size was suggested,

catalog (http://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/CME_list). The emission lines observed
provide diagnostics of CME plasma parameters, such as the light-of-sight
velocity, density and temperature and allow to link the CME onset data to the
extended corona white-light images. The catalog indicates whether there are
clear signatures of features such as shock waves, current sheets, O VI flares,
helical motions and which part of the CME structures (front, cavity or
prominence material) are detected. The most common detected structure is the
cool prominence material (in about 70% of the events). For each event, the
catalog also contains movie, images, plots and information relevant to address
detailed scientific investigations. The number of events detected in UV is
about 1/10 of the LASCO CMEs, and about 1/4 of the halo events. We find that

compare the results with those obtained in the standard CDM scenario with
different efficiencies for the stellar feedback. Taking on our previous
exploration of galaxy formation in WDM cosmology, we assume as a reference case
a spectrum which is suppressed - compared to the standard CDM case - below a
cut-off scale ~ 0.2$ Mpc corresponding (for thermal relic WDM particles) to a
mass m_X=0.75 keV. We run our fiducial semi-analytic model with such a WDM
spectrum to derive AGN luminosity functions from z~6 to the present over a wide
range of luminosities (10^43< L_X/erg/s < 10^46 in the 2-10 keV X-ray band), to
compare with recent observations and with the results in the CDM case. When
compared with the standard CDM case, the luminosity distributions we obtain
assuming a WDM spectrum are characterized by a similar behaviour at low
redshift, and by a flatter slope at faint magnitudes for z>3, which provide an
excellent fit to present observations. We discuss how such a result compares
with CDM models with maximized feedback efficiency, and how future deep AGN
surveys will allow for a better discrimination between feedback and
cosmological effects on the evolution of AGN in interaction-driven models for
AGN fueling.

this is the first reported effort where a realistic force field is used to
investigate the folding pathways of a protein with complex native topology. By
using the dominant-reaction pathway scheme we collected about 30 successful
folding trajectories for the 82-amino acid long trefoil-knotted protein.
Despite the dissimilarity of their initial unfolded configuration, these
trajectories reach the natively-knotted state through a remarkably similar
succession of steps. In particular it is found that knotting occurs essentially
through a threading mechanism, involving the passage of the C-terminal through
an open region created by the formation of the native beta-sheet at an earlier
stage. The dominance of the knotting by threading mechanism is not observed in

as a function of their flux density was one of the earliest cosmological
probes. Radio source counts continue to be an area of interest, used to study
the relative populations of galaxy types in the Universe (as well as
investigate any cosmological evolution in luminosity functions). They are a
vital consideration for determining how source confusion may limit the depth of
a radio interferometer observation, and are essential for characterising
extragalactic foregrounds in CMB experiments. There is currently no consensus
as to the relative populations of the faintest (sub-mJy) source types, where
the counts turn-up. Most of the source counts in this regime are gathered from
multiple observations that each use a deep, single pointing with a radio
interferometer. These independent measurements show large amounts of scatter
(factors ~ a few) that significantly exceeds their stated uncertainties. In
this article we use a simulation of the extragalactic radio continuum emission
to assess the level at which sample variance may be the cause of the scatter.
We find that the scatter induced by sample variance in the simulated counts
decreases towards lower flux density bins as the raw source counts increase.
The field-to-field variations are significant, and could even be the sole cause
at >100 {\mu}Jy. We present a method for evaluating the flux density limit that
a survey must reach in order to reduce the count uncertainty induced by sample
variance to a specific value. We also derive a method for correcting Poisson
errors on counts in order to include the uncertainties due to the cosmological
clustering of sources. An empirical constraint on the effect of sample variance
at these low luminosities is unlikely to arise until the completion of new

concern of every organization. As an organizations employees need to access
such information in order to carry out their daily work, data leakage detection
is both an essential and challenging task. Whether caused by malicious intent
or an inadvertent mistake, data loss can result in significant damage to the
organization. Fingerprinting is a content-based method used for detecting data
leakage. In fingerprinting, signatures of known confidential content are
extracted and matched with outgoing content in order to detect leakage of
sensitive content. Existing fingerprinting methods, however, suffer from two
major limitations. First, fingerprinting can be bypassed by rephrasing (or
minor modification) of the confidential content, and second, usually the whole
content of document is fingerprinted (including non-confidential parts),
resulting in false alarms. In this paper we propose an extension to the
fingerprinting approach that is based on sorted k-skip-n-grams. The proposed
method is able to produce a fingerprint of the core confidential content which
ignores non-relevant (non-confidential) sections. In addition, the proposed
fingerprint method is more robust to rephrasing and can also be used to detect
a previously unseen confidential document and therefore provide better
detection of intentional leakage incidents.

inclined orbits. For given planet mass, a threshold relative orbital
inclination exists under which a gap forms. At high relative inclinations, the
inclination decay rate increases for increasing planet mass and decreasing
initial relative inclination.
  For an initial semi-major axis of 5 AU and relative inclination of
$i_0=80^\circ,$ the times required for the inclination to decay by $10^\circ$
is $\sim10^{6}\ \rmn{yr}$ and $\sim10^{5}\ \rmn{yr}$ for $1\ \rmn{M_J}$ and $6\

using an in silico approach. Six types of the nucleotide tandem repeat motifs
have been investigated, including mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and
hexanucleotide. The distribution of the repeat motifs in the gene was analyzed.
The results of this study provide an insight into the biomolecular mechanisms
and pathogenesis implicated by the GIF of gastric parietal cells. Based on the
findings of the tandem repeats in GIF of gastric parietal cells, therapeutic
strategies and disease markers may be developed accordingly by the biomedical
scientists.

Accepted by MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stt257",,"astro-ph.SR astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The flux density spectra of radio pulsars are known to be steep and, to first
order, described by a power-law relationship of the form S_{\nu} \propto
\nu^{\alpha}, where S_{\nu} is the flux density at some frequency \nu and
\alpha is the spectral index. Although measurements of \alpha have been made
over the years for several hundred pulsars, a study of the intrinsic
distribution of pulsar spectra has not been carried out. From the result of
pulsar surveys carried out at three different radio frequencies, we use
population synthesis techniques and a likelihood analysis to deduce what
underlying spectral index distribution is required to replicate the results of
these surveys. We find that in general the results of the surveys can be
modelled by a Gaussian distribution of spectral indices with a mean of -1.4 and
unit standard deviation. We also consider the impact of the so-called
""Gigahertz-peaked spectrum"" pulsars. The fraction of peaked spectrum sources in
the population with significant turn-over at low frequencies appears to be at
most 10%. We demonstrate that high-frequency (>2 GHz) surveys preferentially
select flatter-spectrum pulsars and the converse is true for lower-frequency
(<1 GHz) surveys. This implies that any correlations between \alpha and other
pulsar parameters (for example age or magnetic field) need to carefully account
for selection biases in pulsar surveys. We also expect that many known pulsars
which have been detected at high frequencies will have shallow, or positive,
spectral indices. The majority of pulsars do not have recorded flux density
measurements over a wide frequency range, making it impossible to constrain
their spectral shapes. We also suggest that such measurements would allow an
improved description of any populations of pulsars with 'non-standard' spectra.

a moduli stack of semistable morphisms from Azumaya nodal curves with a
fundamental module to a projective Calabi-Yau 3-fold $Y$. In this Part I of the
note, D(10.1), we define the notion of twisted central charge $Z$ for
Fourier-Mukai transforms of dimension 1 and width [0] from nodal curves and the

transforms of dimension 1 and width [0] from nodal curves in the family
$C_{\cal M}/{\cal M}$ to $Y$ of fixed twisted central charge $c$ is compact.
For the application in the sequel D(10.2), $C_{\cal M}/{\cal M}$ will contain
$C_{\bar{\cal M}_g}/\bar{\cal M}_g$ as a substack and $FM^{1,[0];Zss}_{C_{\cal

introduce an optimization model for reconstruction of sparse signals from 1-bit

signals satisfying consistency constraints stemming from the 1-bit
measurements. An algorithm for solving the model is developed. Convergence
analysis of the algorithm is presented. Our approach is to obtain a sequence of
optimization problems by successively approximating the l0-norm and to solve
resulting problems by exploiting the proximity operator. We examine the
performance of our proposed algorithm and compare it with the binary iterative
hard thresholding (BIHT) [10] a state-of-the-art algorithm for 1-bit
compressive sampling reconstruction. Unlike the BIHT, our model and algorithm
does not require a prior knowledge on the sparsity of the signal. This makes
our proposed work a promising practical approach for signal acquisition.

non-interacting qubits subject to a classical random telegraph noise in common
and separated environments. Two initial entangled states of the system are
examined, namely the GHZ- and W-type states. The dynamics of quantum
correlations results to be strongly affected by the input configuration of the
qubits, the type of the system-environment interaction, and the memory
properties of the environmental noise. When the qubits are non-locally coupled
to the random telegraph noise, the GHZ-type states partially preserve, at long
times, both discord and entanglement, regardless the correlation time of the
environmental noise. The survived entangled states turn out to be also
detectable by means of suitable entanglement witnesses. On the other hand, in
the same conditions, the decohering effects suppress all the quantum
correlation of the W-type states which are thus less robust than the GHZ-type
ones. The long-time survival of tripartite discord and entanglement opens
interesting perspectives in the use of multipartite entangled states for
practical applications in quantum information science.

line core intensity contrast of network and faculae, specifically, their
relationship with magnetic field and disc position. Full-disc magnetograms and
intensity images by the HMI instrument onboard SDO were employed. Bright
magnetic features, representing network and faculae, were identified and the
relationship between their intensity contrast at continuum and line core with
magnetogram signal and heliocentric angle examined. Care was taken to minimize
the inclusion of the magnetic canopy and straylight from sunspots and pores as
network and faculae. In line with earlier studies, network features, on a per
unit magnetic flux basis, appeared brighter than facular features. Intensity
contrasts in the continuum and line core differ considerably, most notably,
they exhibit opposite centre-to-limb variations. We found this difference in
behaviour to likely be due to the different mechanisms of the formation of the
two spectral components. From a simple model based on bivariate polynomial fits
to the measured contrasts we confirmed spectral line changes to be a
significant driver of facular contribution to variation in solar irradiance.
The discrepancy between the continuum contrast reported here and in the
literature was shown to arise mainly from differences in spatial resolution and
treatment of magnetic signals adjacent to sunspots and pores. HMI is a source
of accurate contrasts and low-noise magnetograms covering the full solar disc.
For irradiance studies it is important to consider not just the contribution
from the continuum but also from the spectral lines. In order not to
underestimate long-term variations in solar irradiance, irradiance models
should take the greater contrast per unit magnetic flux associated with
magnetic features with low magnetic flux into account.

non-thermal fixed points, the system shows universal long-range properties
manifest through scaling, i.e., self-similar correlations. The spatial field

domain formation whose geometry gives rise to the particular scaling laws seen

At each time-slot, the source and (possibly) one of the relays transmit a

inter-relay interference (IRI). In this work, with the aid of buffers at the
relays, we mitigate the detrimental effect of IRI through interference
cancellation. More specifically, we propose the min-power scheme that minimizes
the total energy expenditure per time slot under an IRI cancellation scheme.
Apart from minimizing the energy expenditure, the min-power selection scheme,
also provides better throughput and lower outage probability than existing
works in the literature. It is the first time that interference cancellation is
combined with buffer-aided relays and power adaptation to mitigate the IRI and
minimize the energy expenditure. The new relay selection policy is analyzed in
terms of outage probability and diversity, by modeling the evolution of the
relay buffers as a Markov Chain (MC). We construct the state transition matrix
of the MC, and hence obtain the steady state with which we can characterize the
outage probability. The proposed scheme outperforms relevant state-of-the-art
relay selection schemes in terms of throughput, diversity and energy

arising from the interaction of the interplanetary magnetic field and the
planetary magnetosphere, and show that this is capable of providing enough
energy to explain the observed planetary radii. Such a model predicts that the
degree of heating should be dependent on the stellar magnetic field, for which
stellar activity serves as a proxy. Accordingly, I examine populations of hot
Jupiters from the Kepler database and confirm that stellar activity (determined
using Kepler CDPP levels) is correlated with the presence of planetary radii
inflated beyond the basal level of R = 0.87 R_J identified by previous
researchers. I propose that the primary mechanism for transferring energy from
the magnetosphere to the planetary interior is Joule heating arising from
global electric circuits analogous to those seen in solar system objects.

contrasting the 2012 May 17 GLE with six other non-GLE eruptions from

that the latitudinal distance from the ecliptic is rather large for the non-GLE

angle, making the connectivity to Earth poorer. We also find that the coronal

wideband spectrum using partial measurements without reconstructing the full
frequency spectrum. Sub-Nyquist sampling rates are adopted in sampling channels
for wrapping the frequency spectrum onto itself. This significantly reduces
sensing requirements of CR. The effects of sub-Nyquist sampling are considered,
and the performance of multi-channel sub-Nyquist samplings is analyzed. To
improve its detection performance, sub-Nyquist sampling rates are chosen to be
different such that the numbers of samples are consecutive prime numbers.
Furthermore, when the received signals at CRs are faded or shadowed, the
performance of MS3 is analytically evaluated. Numerical results show that the

control the timing of Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles. Evidence comes
from power spectrum analysis of palaeoclimate records and from inspection of
the timing of glacial and deglacial transitions. However, we do not know how
tight this control is. Is it, for example, conceivable that random climatic
fluctuations could cause a delay in deglaciation, bad enough to skip a full
precession or obliquity cycle and subsequently modify the sequence of ice ages?
  To address this question, seven previously published conceptual models of ice
ages are analysed by reference to the notion of generalised synchronisation.
Insight is being gained by comparing the effects of the astronomical forcing
with idealised forcings composed of only one or two periodic components. In
general, the richness of the astronomical forcing allows for synchronisation
over a wider range of parameters, compared to periodic forcing. Hence, glacial
cycles may conceivably have remained paced by the astronomical forcing

  However, all the models examined here also show a range of parameters for
which the structural stability of the ice age dynamics is weak. This means that
small variations in parameters or random fluctuations may cause significant
shifts in the succession of ice ages if the system were effectively in that
parameter range. Whether or not the system has strong structural stability
depends on the amplitude of the effects associated with the astronomical
forcing, which significantly differ across the different models studied here.
The possibility of synchronisation on eccentricity is also discussed and it is
shown that a high Rayleigh number on eccentricity, as recently found in
observations, is no guarantee of reliable synchronisation.

multi-waveband light curves and to seek correlations between the variability

(ZDCF) is a new method for estimating the CCF of sparse, unevenly sampled light
curves. Unlike the commonly used interpolation method, it does not assume that
the light curves are smooth and it does provide errors on its estimates. The
ZDCF corrects several biases of the discrete correlation function method of
Edelson & Krolik (1988) by using equal population binning and Fisher's z
-transform. These lead to a more robust and powerful method of estimating the
CCF of sparse light curves of as few as 12 points. Two examples of light curve
analysis with the ZDCF are presented. 1) The ZDCF estimate of the
auto-correlation function is used to uncover a correlation between AGN
magnitude and variability time scale in a small simulated sample of very sparse

ZDCF peak location is used to estimate the time-lag between two light curves.

associated with the problem has a robust local inverse even though its
condition number is exponentially small. A corollary of our result is the first
polynomial time algorithm for learning DNFs in the restriction access model of

making unjustified the use solely of traditional, 'hot-start' cooling tracks to
interpret direct imaging results and calling for an observational determination
of initial entropies to guide formation scenarios. Using a grid of models in
mass and entropy, we show how to place joint constraints on the mass and
initial entropy of an object from its observed luminosity and age. This
generalises the usual estimate of only a lower bound on the real mass through
hot-start tracks. Moreover, we demonstrate that with mass information, e.g.
from dynamical stability analyses or radial velocity, tighter bounds can be set
on the initial entropy. We apply this procedure to 2M1207 b and find that its
initial entropy is at least 9.2 kB/baryon, assuming that it does not burn
deuterium. For the planets of the HR 8799 system, we infer that they must have
formed with S_i > 9.2 kB/baryon, independent of uncertainties about the age of
the star. Finally, a similar analysis for beta Pic b reveals that it must have
formed with S_i > 10.5 kB/baryon, using the radial-velocity mass upper limit.
These initial entropy values are respectively ca. 0.7, 0.5, and 1.5 kB/baryon
higher than the ones obtained from core accretion models by Marley et al.,
thereby quantitatively ruling out the coldest starts for these objects and
constraining warm starts, especially for beta Pic b.

(BHs) and galaxies within a hierarchical Universe. The model is tuned to match
the mass function of BHs at z=0 and the luminosity functions of active galactic
nuclei (AGNs) at z<4. We use a new observational constraint, which relates the
luminosity of AGNs to the star-formation rate (SFR) of their host galaxies. We
show that this new constraint is important in various aspects: a) it indicates
that BH accretion events are episodic; b) it favours a scenario in which BH
accretion is triggered by merger events of all mass ratios; c) it constrains
the duration of both merger-induced star-bursts and BH accretion events. The
model reproduces the observations once we assume that only 4 per cent of the
merger events trigger BH accretion; BHs accretion is not related to secular
evolution; and only a few per cent of the mass made in bursts goes into the BH.
We find that AGNs with low or intermediate luminosity are mostly being
triggered by minor merger events, in broad agreement with observations. Our
model matches various observed properties of galaxies, such as the stellar mass
function at z<4 and the clustering of galaxies at redshift zero. This allows us
to use galaxies as a reliable backbone for BH growth, with reasonable estimates
for the frequency of merger events. Other modes of BH accretion, such as
disk-instability events, were not considered here, and should be further
examined in the future.

lenticular galaxies (S0's), on the basis that even minor ones induce structural
changes that are difficult to reconcile with the strong bulge-disk coupling
observed in the photometric scaling relations of S0's. We check if the
evolution induced onto S0's by dry intermediate and minor mergers can reproduce
their photometric scaling relations, analysing the bulge-disk decompositions of
the merger simulations presented in Eliche-Moral et al. (2012). The mergers
induce an evolution in the photometric planes compatible with the data of S0's,
even in those ones indicating a strong bulge-disk coupling. The mergers drive
the formation of the observed photometric relation in some cases, whereas they
induce a slight dispersion compatible with data in others. Therefore, this
evolutionary mechanism tends to preserve these scaling relations. In those
photometric planes where the morphological types segregate, the mergers always
induce evolution towards the region populated by S0's. The structural coupling
of the bulge and the disk is preserved or reinforced because the mergers
trigger internal secular processes in the primary disk that induce significant
bulge growth, even although these models do not induce bars. Intermediate and
minor mergers can thus be considered as plausible mechanisms for the evolution
of S0's attending to their photometric scaling relations, as they can preserve
and even strengthen any pre-existing structural bulge-disk coupling, triggering
significant internal secular evolution (even in the absence of bars or
dissipational effects). This means that it may be difficult to isolate the
effects of pure internal secular evolution from those of the merger-driven one
in present-day early-type disks (abridged).

through different amounts of matter in Earth and since different flavors of

measurement of the angular distribution of incoming events by a neutrino

an attempt. Simulations were performed, where the detector configuration was
based on the proposed Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) Observatory at the South Pole,
to investigate the expected event-direction distribution for each flavor.
Assuming $\nu_{\mu}$-$\nu_{\tau}$ symmetry and invoking the standard
oscillation and the neutrino decay scenarios, the probability distribution
functions (PDF) of the event directions are utilized to extract the flavor
ratio of cosmogenic neutrinos on Earth. The simulation results are summarized
in terms of the probability of flavor ratio extraction and resolution as
functions of the number of observed events and the angular resolution of
neutrino directions. We show that it is feasible to constrain the UHECN flavor

substantially lower than expected from the local black hole - velocity

gain-based, low-rank approximation to turbulent channel flows, determined by
the resolvent formulation of McKeon & Sharma (2010), in order to obtain a
description of the streamwise turbulence intensity from direct consideration of
the Navier-Stokes equations. Under this formulation, the velocity field is
decomposed into propagating waves (with single streamwise and spanwise
wavelengths and wave speed) whose wall-normal shapes are determined from the
principal singular function of the corresponding resolvent operator. Using the
accepted scalings of the mean velocity in wall-bounded turbulent flows, we
establish that the resolvent operator admits three classes of wave parameters
that induce universal behavior with Reynolds number on the low-rank model, and
which are consistent with scalings proposed throughout the wall turbulence
literature. In addition, it was shown that a necessary condition for
geometrically self-similar resolvent modes is the presence of a logarithmic
turbulent mean velocity. We identify the scalings that constitute hierarchies
of self-similar modes that are parameterized by the critical wall-normal
location where the speed of the mode equals the local turbulent mean velocity.
For the rank-1 model subject to broadband forcing, the integrated streamwise
energy density takes a universal form which is consistent with the dominant
near-wall turbulent motions. When the shape of the forcing is optimized to
enforce matching with results from direct numerical simulations at low
turbulent Reynolds numbers, further similarity appears. Representation of these
weight functions using similarity laws enables prediction of the Reynolds
number and wall-normal variations of the streamwise energy intensity at high
Reynolds numbers (${Re}_\tau \approx 10^3 - 10^{10}$).

coupling between a localized magnetic moment and valence electrons, increases
with reducing temperature. The electronic spectral function for such a system
predicts a narrow Kondo resonance close to Fermi energy below its Kondo
temperature 'TK'. The internal energy level structure of the localized magnetic
moment introduces sidebands near the Kondo resonance, each with its respective
Kondo temperature increasing as the sideband position moves towards higher
binding energies. Consequently, the temperature dependence of the resonance
features becomes weaker as we go towards higher binding energies. Here, we show
a Ce4f photoemission spectral evolution obtained from a prototypical Kondo
system CeAl2, departing from the predictions of the spectral function. Our
measurements reveal a uniform temperature dependence for all the well screened
Ce4f photoemission features (4f1 final state), which are usually interpreted as
resonance features, as we reduce the temperature suggesting that the resonance
interpretation for the 4f1 final state features is not appropriate. Instead,
the spectral evolution is explained simply by the temperature dependence of the
strength of the coupling between Ce4f and valence electrons, which remains
uniform over the range of 4f1 final state features. As a possible explanation
to the observed spectral evolution, we propose the phenomenon of collapse of
the Kondo singlet wave function upon photoelectron kinetic energy measurement,
analogous to the wave function collapse observed upon measurements performed on
an entangled EPR (Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen) pair. Our proposal highlights how

these cosmological horizons in an accelerated universe with two state
equations, cosmological constant and dust. We have obtained closed-form
expressions for the horizons, which have allowed us to compute their velocities
in terms of their respective recession velocities that generalize the previous
results for one state equation only. With the equations of state considered, it
is proved that both velocities remain always positive.

Documents clustering aim to automatically group similar documents in one

affected by the documents length, useful information on the documents is often
accompanied by a large amount of noise, and therefore it is necessary to
eliminate this noise while keeping useful information to boost the performance

bulge, which is often taken as a signature of dissipative processes in the
formation of a classical bulge. Various evidence shows, however, that the Milky
Way is a barred galaxy with a boxy bulge representing the inner
three-dimensional part of the bar. Here we show with a secular evolution N-body
model that a boxy bulge formed through bar and buckling instabilities can show
vertical metallicity gradients similar to the observed gradient, if the initial
axisymmetric disk had a comparable radial metallicity gradient. In this
framework the range of metallicities in bulge fields constrains the chemical
structure of the Galactic disk at early times, before bar formation. Our
secular evolution model was previously shown to reproduce inner Galaxy star
counts and we show here that it also has cylindrical rotation. We use it to
predict a full mean metallicity map across the Galactic bulge from a simple
metallicity model for the initial disk. This map shows a general outward
gradient on the sky as well as longitudinal perspective asymmetries. We also
briefly comment on interpreting metallicity gradient observations in external
boxy bulges.

confining fluorescence excitation to a thin layer close to the cell/substrate
interface. How thin this light sheet exactly is, however, is often unknown.
Particularly in the popular objective-type total internal reflection
fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) configuration large deviations from the
expected exponential intensity decay of the evanescent wave have been reported.
Propagating, i.e., non-evanescent, excitation light diminishes the optical
sectioning effect, reduces contrast and renders the quantification of TIRFM
images uncertain. Here, we use a combination of azimuthal- and polar-angle beam
scanning, dark-field scatter imaging, and atomic force microscopy to identify
the sources of this unwanted background fluorescence excitation. We identify
stray light originating from the microscope optics and the objective lens
itself as the major sources of background, with minor contributions due to
evanescent-wave scattering at the reflecting interface and at refractive-index
boundaries in the sample. Apart from evanescence in excitation light, light
emitted from a fluorophore can also show observable effects of evanescence.
Only fluorophores located close to the coverslip can couple their near-field
radiation into propagating waves detectable at supercritical angles. We show
that selectively detecting this supercritical-angle fluorescence (SAF) through
a high-numerical aperture objective effectively rejects fluorescence from
deeper sample regions and improves optical sectioning. The microscopy scheme
presented here merges the benefits of TIRF excitation and SAF detection and
provides the conditions for quantitative wide-field imaging of fluorophore
dynamics at or near the plasma membrane.

we derive an equivalent Kalman filter for sensor selection, i.e., generalized
information filter. Then, under a regularity condition, we prove that the
multistage look-ahead policy that minimizes either the final or the average
estimation error covariances of next multiple time steps is equivalent to a
myopic sensor selection policy that maximizes the trace of the generalized
information gain at each time step. Moreover, when the measurement noises are
uncorrelated between sensors, the optimal solution can be obtained analytically
for sensor selection when constraints are temporally separable. When
constraints are temporally inseparable, sensor selections can be obtained by
approximately solving a linear programming problem so that the sensor selection
problem for a large sensor network can be dealt with quickly. Although there is
no guarantee that the gap between the performance of the chosen subset and the
performance bound is always small, numerical examples suggest that the
algorithm is near-optimal in many cases. Finally, when the measurement noises
are correlated between sensors, the sensor selection problem with temporally
inseparable constraints can be relaxed to a Boolean quadratic programming
problem which can be efficiently solved by a Gaussian randomization procedure
along with solving a semi-definite programming problem. Numerical examples show
that the proposed method is much better than the method that ignores dependence

maintain eccentric orbits despite tidal circularization timescales that are
typically shorter than stellar ages. We explore gravitational interactions with
a distant planetary companion as a possible cause of these non-zero
eccentricities. For simplicity, we focus on the evolution of a planar
two-planet system subject to slow eccentricity damping and provide an intuitive
interpretation of the resulting long-term orbital evolution. We show that
dissipation shifts the two normal eigenmode frequencies and eccentricity ratios
of the standard secular theory slightly, and that each mode decays at its own
rate. Tidal damping of the eccentricities drives orbits to transition between
periods of pericenter circulation and libration, and the planetary system
settles into a locked state where the pericenters are nearly aligned or
anti-aligned. Once in the locked state, the eccentricities of the two orbits
decrease very slowly due to tides rather than at the much more rapid
single-planet rate, and thus eccentric orbits, even for close-in planets, can
often survive much longer than the age of the system. Assuming that an observed
close-in planet on an elliptical orbit is apsidally-locked to a more distant,
and perhaps unseen companion, we provide a constraint on the mass, semi-major
axis, and eccentricity of the companion. We find the observed two-planet system
HAT-P-13 might be in just such an apsidally-locked state, with parameters that
obey our constraint well. We also survey close-in single planets, and found
that none provide compelling evidence for unseen companions. Instead, we
suspect that (1) orbits are circular, (2) tidal damping rates are slower than
our assumption, or (3) a recent event has excited these eccentricities. Our
method should prove useful for interpreting the results of current and future
planet searches.

two-point statistics using N-body simulations. We find that nonlinear damping
of the BAO signal is less severe for halos in the mass range we investigate
than for dark matter. The amount of damping depends weakly on the halo mass.
The correlation functions show a mass-dependent drop of the halo clustering
bias below roughly 90 Mpc/h, which coincides with the scale of the BAO trough.
The drop of bias is 4% for halos with mass M>10^{14} Msun/h and reduces to
roughly 2% for halos with mass M>10^{13} Msun/h. In contrast, halo biases in
simulations without BAO change more smoothly around 90 Mpc/h. In Fourier space,
the bias of M>10^{14} Msun/h halos decreases smoothly by 11% from wavenumber k
= 0.012 h/Mpc to 0.2 h/Mpc, whereas that of M>10^{13} Msun/h halos decreases by
less than 4% over the same range. By comparing the halo biases in pairs of
otherwise identical simulations, one with and the other without BAO, we also
observe a modulation of the halo bias. These results suggest that precise
calibrations of the mass-dependent BAO signal and scale-dependent bias on large
scales would be needed for interpreting precise measurements of the two-point
statistics of clusters or massive galaxies in the future.

times (or relative rates of entropy increase above Tg) across a
""strong-fragile"" spectrum of behaviors, the ""strong"" liquids have always
appeared rather uninteresting [1, 2]. Here we use updated plots of the same
type for crystal phases of the ""rotator"" variety [3] to confirm that the same
pattern of behavior exists for these simpler (center of mass ordered) systems.
However, in this case we can show that the ""strong"" systems owe their behavior
to the existence of lambda-type order-disorder transitions at higher
temperatures (directly observable in the cases where observations are not
interrupted by prior melting). Furthermore, the same observation can be made
for other systems in which the glass transition, at which the ordering is
arrested, occurs in the thermodynamic ground state of the system. This prompts
an enquiry into the behavior of strong liquids at high temperatures. Using the
case of silica itself, we again find strong evidence from extended ion dynamics
simulations, for a lambda transition at high temperatures, but only if pressure
is adjusted to a critical value. In this case the lambda point is identifiable
as a liquid-liquid critical point of the type suggested for supercooled water.
We recognize the possibility of exploring, a postiori, the consequences of
rapid cooling of laboratory liquid SiO2 from >5000K and multi-GPa pressures,
using the phenomenology of damage-induced plasmas in optical fibers. The
ramifications of these considerations will be explored to establish a ""big

given an ergodic Brownian diffusion with a unique invariant distribution, what

trajectories are driven by the same Brownian path. Under this assumption, we
first show that uniqueness of the invariant distribution (weak confluence) of
the duplicated system is essentially always true in the one-dimensional case.
In the multidimensional case, we begin by exhibiting explicit counter-examples.
Then, we provide a series of weak confluence criterions (of integral type) and
also of a.s. pathwise confluence, depending on the drift and diffusion
coefficients through a non-infinitesimal Lyapunov exponent. As examples, we
apply our criterions to some non-trivially confluent settings such as classes
of gradient systems with non-convex potentials or diffusions where the
confluence is generated by the diffusive component. We finally establish that
the weak confluence property is connected with an optimal transport problem. As
a main application, we apply our results to the optimization of the
Richardson-Romberg extrapolation for the numerical approximation of the
invariant measure of the initial ergodic Brownian diffusion.

The model describes consistent local-time evolutions of fuzzy spaces through a

structure functions. In fact, the algebra provides an algebraically consistent
discretization of the Dirac-DeWitt constraint algebra in the canonical
formalism of general relativity. However, the configuration space of this model
contains obvious degeneracies of representing identical fuzzy spaces. In this
paper, to delete the degeneracies, another first-class constraint representing
a scaling symmetry is added to propose a new canonical rank-three tensor model.
A consequence is that, while classical solutions of the previous model have
typically runaway or vanishing behaviors, the new model has a compact
configuration space and its classical solutions asymptotically approach either
fixed points or cyclic orbits in time evolution. Among others, fixed points
contain configurations with group symmetries, and may represent stationary
symmetric fuzzy spaces. Another consequence on the uniqueness of the local
Hamiltonian constraint is also discussed, and a minimal canonical tensor model,

where signals from multiple cameras are transmitted to a central location. Due
to the high pathloss of 60 GHz radiation over the large distances encountered
in this scenario, the use of relays might be required. The current paper
analyzes the joint selection of the routes (relays) and the compression rates
from the various sources for maximization of the overall video quality. We
consider three different scenarios: (i) each source transmits only to one relay
and the relay can receive only one data stream, and (ii) each source can
transmit only to a single relay, but relays can aggregate streams from
different sources and forward to the destination, and (iii) the source can
split its data stream into parallel streams, which can be transmitted via
different relays to the destination. For each scenario, we derive the
mathematical formulations of the optimization problem and re-formulate them as
convex mixed-integer programming, which can guarantee optimal solutions.
Extensive simulations demonstrate that high-quality transmission is possible
for at least ten cameras over distances of 300 m. Furthermore, optimization of
the video quality gives results that can significantly outperform algorithms

generating the latter process (i.e. one has $Y(t)=X(t,H(t))$ for all $t\in\R$).
This leads us to introduce random wavelet series representations of $\{X(u,v) :
(u,v)\in\R \times (1/\alpha,1)\}$ as well as of all its pathwise partial
derivatives of any order with respect to $v$. Then our strategy consists in
using wavelet methods. Among other things, we solve a conjecture of Stoev and
Taqqu, concerning the existence for LMSM of a modification with almost surely
continuous paths; moreover we provides some bounds for the local H\""older
exponent of LMSM: namely, we obtain a quasi-optimal global modulus of
continuity for it, and also an optimal local one. It is worth noticing that,
even in the quite classical case of LFSM, the latter optimal local modulus of
continuity provides a new result which was unknown so far.

why DDDP exhibits larger routing overhead than FDDDP by 74.2% on average.
Although CBDDP produces approximately 94.6% smaller overhead than DDDP and

the galaxy. All the clusters have masses exceeding 10^5 Msun and are, despite
the 64 Mpc distance to the galaxy, (partly) resolved on the HST images.
Effective radii can be measured down to ~2.5 pc, and the largest clusters have
Reff approaching 20 pc. The median Reff of our sample clusters is ~6-7 pc,
which is larger than typical radii of YMCs (~2.5 pc). This could be due to our
sample selection (only selecting resolved sources) or to an intrinsic
mass--radius relation within the cluster population. We find at least three
clusters that have power-law profiles of the Elson, Fall, & Freeman (1987,
""EFF"") type extending out to >150 pc. Among them are the two most massive
clusters, W3 and W30, which have profiles that extend to at least 500 and 250
pc, respectively. Despite their extended profiles, the effective radii of the
three clusters are 17.2, 12.6 and 9.1 pc for W3, W26 and W30, respectively. We
compare these extended profiles with those of YMCs in the LMC (R136 in 30 Dor),
the Antennae galaxies (Knot S) and in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 6946.
Extended profiles seem to be a somewhat common feature, even though many nearby
YMCs show distinct truncations. A continuous distribution between these two
extremes, i.e. truncated or extremely extended, is the most likely
interpretation. We suggest that the presence or absence of an extended envelope
in {\em very young clusters} may be due to the gas distribution of the
proto-cluster giant molecular cloud, in particular if the proto-cluster core
becomes distinct from the surrounding gas before star formation begins.

all $H$-free graphs with $n$ vertices. Pikhurko and Taraz generalize this
Tur\'an-type problem: let $f$ be a non-negative increasing real function and
$e_f(G)=\sum_{i=1}^n f(d_i)$, and then define $ex_f(n,H)$ as the maximum value

$ex_f(n,H)=ex_p(n,H)$ if $f(x)=x^p$. Bollob\'as and Nikiforov mentioned that it
is important to study concrete functions. They gave an example
$f(x)=\phi(k)={x\choose k}$, since $\sum_{i=1}^n{d_i\choose k}$ counts the
$(k+1)$-vertex subgraphs of $G$ with a dominating vertex.
  Denote by $T_r(n)$ the $r$-partite Tur\'an graph of order $n$. In this paper,
using the Bollob\'as--Nikiforov's methods, we give some results on

$ex_\phi(n,K_{r+1})=e_\phi(T_r(n))$; for each $k$, there exists a constant
$c=c(k)$ such that for every $r\geq c(k)$ and sufficiently large $n$,
$ex_\phi(n,K_{r+1})=e_\phi(T_r(n))$; for a fixed $(r+1)$-chromatic graph $H$

and Dirac spinor fields are investigated in (D+1)-dimensional de Sitter (dS)

dimensions we impose quasiperiodicity conditions with arbitrary phases. In
addition, the presence of a classical constant gauge field is assumed. The VEVs
of the charge density and of the components for the current density along
noncompact dimensions vanish. The gauge field leads to Aharonov-Bohm-like
oscillations of the components along compact dimensions as functions of the
magnetic flux. For small values of the comoving length of a compact dimension,
compared with the dS curvature scale, the current density is related to the
corresponding current in the Minkowski spacetime by a conformal relation. For
large values of the comoving length and for a scalar field, depending on the
mass of the field, two different regimes are realized with the monotonic and
oscillatory damping of the current density. For a massive spinor field, the
decay of the current density is always oscillatory. In supersymmetric models on
the background of Minkowski spacetime with equal number of scalar and fermionic
degrees of freedom and with the same phases in the periodicity conditions, the
total current density vanishes due to the cancellation between the scalar and
fermionic parts. The background gravitational field modifies the current

evolution of low-mass X-ray binaries, both containing a neutron star and a
black hole, was possible. In this context, the notion of source states
characterizing the X-ray emission from black-hole binaries and neutron-star
low-mass X-ray binaries revealed to be a very useful tool to disentangle the
complex spectral and aperiodic phenomenology displayed by those classes of
accreting objects. Be/X-ray binaries constitute another major class of
transient accreting binaries, for which very little work has been done on the
correlated timing and spectral variability. Especially, no definition of source
states exists for this class, in spite of their highly variable X-ray emission.
When active, Be/X-ray binaries are among the brightest objects in the X-ray sky
and are characterized by dramatic variability in brightness on timescales
ranging from seconds to years. It is then worth it to ask whether a definition
of spectral states is possible for these systems. In this work, we try to
address such a question, investigating whether accreting X-ray pulsars display
source states and characterizing those states through their spectral
properties. Our results show that Be/X-ray pulsars trace two different branches
in their hardness-intensity diagram: the horizontal branch, a low-intensity
state, and the diagonal branch, a high-intensity state that only appears when
the X-ray luminosity exceeds a critical limit. We propose that the two branches
are the phenomenological signature of two different accretion modes -- in
agreement with recently proposed models -- depending on whether the luminosity
of the source is above or below a critical value.

makes the neutron star core symmetric and lepton-deficient. We show that these

of neutron star. We also show that the recently observed 1.97$\pm$.04 solar

Transient (SFXT) with the shortest orbital period (3.32 days). This allowed us
to perform a 250 ks long X-ray observation with Suzaku in 2012 February,
covering most of its orbit, including the eclipse egress. Outside the eclipse,
the source luminosity is around a few 1E34erg/s. The X-ray spectrum can be fit
with an absorbed power law together with a neutral iron emission line at 6.4
keV. The column density is constant at 1E23 cm-2 outside the X-ray eclipse.
During the eclipse it is lower, consistent with a scattering origin for the low
X-ray emission during the eclipse by the supergiant companion wind. The
scattered X-ray emission during the X-ray eclipse is used to directly probe the
density of the companion wind at the orbital separation, resulting in 7E-14
g/cm3, which translates into a ratio Mdot_w/v_terminal = 7E-17 solar masses/km
of the wind mass loss rate to the wind terminal velocity. This ratio, assuming
reasonable terminal velocities in the range 500-3000 km/s, translates into an
accretion luminosity two orders of magnitude higher than that observed. We
conclude that a mechanism reducing the accretion rate onto the compact object
is at work, likely due to the neutron star magnetosphere.

significant differences between quantum-bath decoherence and decoherence by
classical field noise. We perform measurements of decoherence times of bismuth
donors in natural silicon using both electron spin resonance (ESR) and nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) transitions, and in both cases find excellent
agreement with our theory across a wide parameter range. The universality of
our expression is also tested by quantitative comparisons with previous

direction is chosen to be timelike. This case of a ""periodic time"" is probably
the simplest example of a causality-violating spacetime; it trivially satisfies
all energy conditions usually assumed in general relativity, and its geodesics
are just straight lines. Its relevance for phenomenology of the LHC, on the
other hand, depends on consistency with observational constraints on gravity,
as is mentioned in general but not discussed in any detail by Ho and Weiler. We
verify a basic consistency check for stationary sources.

images collected with the CCD mosaic camera MegaCam at the
Canada-France-Hawaii-Telescope and with the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the
Hubble Space Telescope. The ground-based data were supplemented with the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey photometric catalog. Special care was taken to discriminate
candidate cluster stars from field stars and to subtract the background
contamination from both profiles. By examining the contour levels of the number
density, we found that the stellar distribution becomes clumpy at radial
distances larger than about 13 arcminutes, and there is no preferred
orientation of contours in space. We performed detailed fits of King and Wilson
models to the observed profiles. The best-fit models underestimate the number
density inside the core radius. Wilson models better represent the
observations, in particular in the outermost cluster regions: the good global
agreement of these models with the observations suggests that there is no need
to introduce an extra-tidal halo to explain the radial distribution of stars at
large radial distances. The best-fit models for the number density and the
surface brightness profiles are different, even though they are based on the
same observations. Additional tests support the evidence that this fact
reflects the difference in the radial distribution of the stellar tracers that
determine the observed profiles (main sequence stars for the number density,
bright evolved stars for the surface brightness).

in string theory. The evolution of the closed string is envisaged on the
worldsheet in the presence of its massless excitations. The duality symmetry is
studied when some of the spacial coordinates are compactified on d-dimensional
torus, $T^d$. The known results are reviewed to elucidate that equations of
motion for the compact coordinates are $O(d,d)$ covariant, $d$ being the number
of compact directions. Next, the vertex operators of excited massive levels are
considered in a simple compactification scheme. It is shown that the vertex
operators for each massive level can be cast in a T-duality invariant form in
such a case. Subsequently, the duality properties of superstring is
investigated in the NSR formulation for the massless backgrounds such as
graviton and antisymmetric tensor. The worldsheet superfield formulation is
found to be very suitable for our purpose. The Hassan-Sen compactification is
adopted and it is shown that the worldsheet equations of motion for compact
superfields to be very suitable for our purpose. The Hassan-Sen
compactification is adopted and it is shown that the worldsheet equations of
motion for compact superfields are $O(d,d)$ covariant when the backgrounds are
independent of superfields along compact directions. The vertex operators for
excited levels are presented in the NS-NS sector and it is shown that they can
be cast in T-duality invariant form for the case of Hassan-Sen compactification
scheme. An illustrative example is presented to realize our proposal.

To support our modelling assumptions, we introduce an inequality that resembles
the Second Law of Thermodynamics, containing an entropy-like functional. We
show that its time derivative equals a positive dissipation term minus a
corrector term. The latter term should be small for the time derivative of the
entropy to be positive. In case of isotropic interactions the corrector term is

this term is sufficiently small for the entropy still to increase. Moreover, we
show that the entropy converges in time towards a limit value.

reconnection are anisotropic, have non-trivial spatial correlation and exhibit
the hallmarks of finite range fluid turbulence; they have non-Gaussian
distributions, exhibit Extended Self-Similarity in their scaling and are
spatially multifractal. Furthermore, we find that the field J.E is also
multifractal, so that magnetic energy is converted to plasma kinetic energy in
a manner that is spatially intermittent. This suggests that dissipation in this
sense in collisionless reconnection on kinetic scales has an analogue in
fluid-like turbulent phenomenology, in that it proceeds via multifractal
structures generated by an intermittent cascade.

carry external phases, affecting significantly the state of the measuring
device. These ""predecoherence"" waves perturb randomly the growth of other

wave interactions could generate random fluctuations in the quantum
probabilities of different measurement channels, which could lead in turn to a

  Pathological Synchronization in Parkinson's Disease","19 pages, 8 figures","PLoS ONE 8(3): e58264, 2013","10.1371/journal.pone.0058264",,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Suppression of excessively synchronous beta-band oscillatory activity in the
brain is believed to suppress hypokinetic motor symptoms of Parkinson's
disease. Recently, a lot of interest has been devoted to desynchronizing
delayed feedback deep brain stimulation (DBS). This type of synchrony control
was shown to destabilize the synchronized state in networks of simple model
oscillators as well as in networks of coupled model neurons. However, the
dynamics of the neural activity in Parkinson's disease exhibits complex
intermittent synchronous patterns, far from the idealized synchronous dynamics
used to study the delayed feedback stimulation. This study explores the action
of delayed feedback stimulation on partially synchronized oscillatory dynamics,
similar to what one observes experimentally in parkinsonian patients. We employ
a model of the basal ganglia networks which reproduces experimentally observed
fine temporal structure of the synchronous dynamics. When the parameters of our
model are such that the synchrony is unphysiologically strong, the feedback
exerts a desynchronizing action. However, when the network is tuned to
reproduce the highly variable temporal patterns observed experimentally, the
same kind of delayed feedback may actually increase the synchrony. As network
parameters are changed from the range which produces complete synchrony to
those favoring less synchronous dynamics, desynchronizing delayed feedback may
gradually turn into synchronizing stimulation. This suggests that delayed
feedback DBS in Parkinson's disease may boost rather than suppress
synchronization and is unlikely to be clinically successful. The study also
indicates that delayed feedback stimulation may not necessarily exhibit a
desynchronization effect when acting on a physiologically realistic partially
synchronous dynamics, and provides an example of how to estimate the
stimulation effect.

framework of a reinterpreted Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian on the Lie group u(3).
We calculate expressions for a scalar Higgs mass, an electroweak energy scale,
and vector gauge boson masses which all compare well with observed or derived
values. Our sole ad hoc inputs to the calculations are the classical electron
radius and the weak mixing angle. Our result for the Higgs mass relative to the
electron mass involves only mathematical constants and the fine structure
constant. It yields 125.1 GeV for a fine structure constant taken as a
geometric mean between it's sliding scale values at respectively the electron
mass and the W vector boson mass which are both involved in the neutron decay.
In passing we compare with the neutral flavour baryon spectrum and mention an
approximate calculation of the relative neutron to proton mass ratio of 0.13847
percent which is promisingly close to the observed value of 0.137842 percent.
We finally mention the Fermi coupling constant as a derived quantity.

stressing coronal fields and storing magnetic free energy, which may then be
released during a flare. The \emph{Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager} (HMI)
onboard the \emph{Solar Dynamics Observatory} (SDO) captured the entire
emergence of NOAA AR 11158. This region emerged as two distinct bipoles,
possibly connected underneath the photosphere, yet characterized by different
photospheric field evolutions and fluxes. The combined active region complex
produced 15 GOES C--class, 2 M--class, and the X2.2 Valentine's Day Flare
during the four days after initial emergence on February 12th, 2011. The M and
X class flares are of particular interest because they are nonhomologous,
involving different subregions of the active region. We use a Magnetic Charge
Topology together with the Minimum Current Corona model of the coronal field to
model field evolution of the complex. Combining this with observations of flare
ribbons in the 1600\AA\ channel of the \emph{Atmospheric Imaging Assembly}
(AIA) onboard SDO, we propose a minimization algorithm for estimating the
amount of reconnected flux and resulting drop in magnetic free energy during a
flare. For the M6.6, M2.2, and X2.2 flares, we find a flux exchange of

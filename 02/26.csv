the quantum Hall effect regime. At specific magnetic fields, causing resonant
Umklapp scattering, the system is gapped in the bulk and supports chiral edge
states in close analogy to topological insulators. These gaps result in
plateaus for the Hall conductivity exactly at the known fillings n/m (both
positive integers and m odd) for the integer and fractional quantum Hall
effect. For double strips we find topological phase transitions with phases
that support midgap edge states with flat dispersion. The topological effects
predicted here could be tested directly in optical lattices.

24 northern sky Be stars. The K-band continuum survey was made using the CHARA
Array long baseline interferometer (baselines of 30 to 331 m). The
interferometric visibilities were corrected for the flux contribution of
stellar companions in those cases where the Be star is a member of a known
binary or multiple system. For those targets with good uv coverage, we used a
four parameter Gaussian elliptical disk model to fit the visibilities and to
determine the axial ratio, position angle, K-band photospheric flux
contribution, and angular diameter of the disk major axis. For the other
targets with relatively limited uv coverage, we constrained the axial ratio,
inclination angle, and or disk position angle where necessary in order to
resolve the degeneracy between possible model solutions. We also made fits of
the ultraviolet and infrared spectral energy distributions to estimate the
stellar angular diameter and infrared flux excess of each target. The mean
ratio of the disk diameter (measured in K-band emission) to stellar diameter
(from SED modeling) is 4.4 among the 14 cases where we reliably resolved the
disk emission, a value which is generally lower than the disk size ratio
measured in the higher opacity Halpha emission line. We estimated the
equatorial rotational velocity from the projected rotational velocity and disk
inclination for 12 stars, and most of these stars rotate close to or at the
critical rotational velocity.

unusual renormalizations of the Fermi velocity $v_F$ and gap velocity
$v_{\Delta}$ of these quasiparticles close to various quantum critical points
in a superconducting dome. Special attention is paid to the behavior of the
velocity ratio, $v_{\Delta}/v_F$, since it determines a number of observable
quantities. We perform a renormalization-group analysis and show that the
velocity ratio may vanish, approach unity, or diverge at different quantum
critical points. The corresponding superfluid densities and critical
temperatures are suppressed, slightly increased, or significantly enhanced. The
effects of three types of static disorders, namely, random mass, random gauge
potential, and random chemical potential, on the stability of the system are
also addressed. An analogous analysis reveals that both random mass and random
gauge potential are irrelevant. This implies that these fixed points of the
velocity ratio are stable, and hence observable effects ignited by them are
unchanged. However, the random chemical potential is marginal. As a result,
these fixed points are broken, and thus, the instabilities of quantum phase
transitions are triggered.

finite-dimensional representations of the symmetry algebra of the system,
called the Schwinger-Dunkl algebra sd(2), are investigated. The algebra sd(2)
has six generators, including two involutions and a central element, and can be
seen as a deformation of the Lie algebra u(2). Two of the symmetry generators,
J_3 and J_2, are respectively associated to the separation of variables in
Cartesian and polar coordinates. Using the parabosonic creation/annihilation
operators, two bases for the representations of sd(2), the Cartesian and
circular bases, are constructed. In the Cartesian basis, the operator J_3 is
diagonal and the operator J_2 acts in a tridiagonal fashion. In the circular
basis, the operator J_2 is block upper-triangular with all blocks 2x2 and the
operator J_3 acts in a tridiagonal fashion. The expansion coefficients between
the two bases are given by the Krawtchouk polynomials. In the general case, the
eigenvectors of J_2 in the circular basis are generated by the Heun polynomials
and their components are expressed in terms of the para-Krawtchouk polynomials.
In the fully isotropic case, the eigenvectors of J_2 are generated by little -1
Jacobi or ordinary Jacobi polynomials. The basis in which the operator J_2 is
diagonal is then considered. In this basis, the defining relations of the
Schwinger-Dunkl algebra imply that J_3 acts in a block tridiagonal fashion with
all blocks 2x2. The matrix elements of J_3 in this basis are given explicitly.

in spaces of commuting and anticommuting differential forms. Unlike the
standard supersymmetry, it has Lorentz scalar transformation parameters. It is
related but is not reducible to standard supersymmetry. Reformulation of the
Standard Model with the new supersymmetry, called scalar supersymmetry, can be
achieved with the particle content of the SM. BRST symmetry is extended to
include scalar supersymmetry multiplets. Linear realization of scalar
supersymmetry with free fields or with fields interacting with background
gravity is described. Gauge interactions require non-linear realizations of
scalar supersymmetry and, except for SU(2), non-linear gauge-fixing conditions.
Requiring scalar supersymmetry of interacting action with the simplest chiral
multiplet can reduce the dynamical content of the theory to that of the SM: one
complex scalar, gauge fields, and three generations of Weyl spinors. At low
energies scalar supersymmetry is explicitly broken by gauge interactions.
However, in the asymptotically free case it becomes exact in the ultraviolet
limit. Thus it has the two most desirable features of softly broken standard
supersymmetry built in. Implementation of exact scalar supersymmetry in an
interacting string action is given.

the Minkowski bilinear form of signature $(+,...,+,-)$ instead of the usual
scalar product, and we ask the Gauss map to be a surjection onto the hyperbolic
space $\H^d$. Important examples are embeddings of the universal cover of
so-called globally hyperbolic maximal flat Lorentzian manifolds.
  Basic tools are first derived, similarly to the classical study of convex
bodies. For example, F-convex sets are determined by their support function,
which is defined on $\H^d$. Then the area measures of order $i$, $0\leq i\leq
d$ are defined. As in the convex bodies case, they are the coefficients of the
polynomial in $\epsilon$ which is the volume of an $\epsilon$ approximation of
the convex set. Here the area measures are defined with respect to the
  Lorentzian structure.
  Then we focus on the area measure of order one. Finding necessary and
sufficient conditions for a measure (here on $\H^d$) to be the first area
measure of a F-convex set is the Christoffel Problem. We derive many results
about this problem. If we restrict to ""Fuchsian"" F-convex set (those who are
invariant under linear isometries acting cocompactly on $\H^d$), then the
problem is totally solved, analogously to the case of convex bodies. In this
case the measure can be given on a compact hyperbolic manifold.
  Particular attention is given on the smooth and polyhedral cases. In those
cases, the Christoffel problem is equivalent to prescribing the mean radius of
curvature and the edge lengths respectively.

oscillations, which are neither periodic in 1/B (quantum Hall effect) nor in

a new commensurability between the magnetic flux enclosed within the edge

balance between the pressure gradients, both isotropic and anisotropic, and the
strength of the fields induced by the Misner-Sharp mass inside the separating
shell and by the pressure fluxes. This defines a local equilibrium condition,
but conveys also a non-local character given the definition of the Misner-Sharp
mass. By the same token, it is also a generalized thermodynamical equation of
state as usually interpreted for the perfect fluid case, which now has the
novel feature of involving both the isotropic and the anisotropic stress. We
have cast the governing equations in terms of local, gauge invariant quantities
which are revealing of the role played by the anisotropic pressures and
inhomogeneous electric part of the Weyl tensor. We analyse a particular
solution with dust and radiation that provides an illustration of our
conditions. In addition, our gauge invariant formalism not only encompasses the

rates, the space-time structure of the relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions
is studied. The reaction zones and the reaction frequencies for various types
of reactions are calculated for AGS and SPS energies within the microscopic
transport model. The relation of the reaction zones to the kinetic and chemical
freeze-out processes is discussed. It is shown that the space-time freeze-out
layer is most extended in time in the central region, while, especially for
higher collision energies, the layer becomes very narrow at the sides. The
parametrization of freeze-out hypersurface in the form of specific hyperbola of
constant proper time was confirmed. The specific characteristic time moments of
the fireball evolution are introduced. It is found that the time of the
division of a reaction zone into two separate parts does not depend on the
collision energy. Calculations of the hadronic reaction frequency show that the
evolution of nucleus-nucleus collision can be divided into two hadronic stages.

$\epsilon$-approximate degree of the two-level AND-OR tree for any constant

line of incrementally larger lower bounds. The same lower bound was recently
obtained independently by Sherstov using related techniques. Our second result
gives an explicit dual polynomial that witnesses a tight lower bound for the
approximate degree of any symmetric Boolean function, addressing a question of
\v{S}palek. Our final contribution is to reprove several Markov-type

SMAA methodology with the Choquet integral preference model in order to get
robust recommendations taking into account the whole space of preference

alternatives are evaluated by all the criteria on a common scale, the
preference parameters are given by the capacity expressing the non-additive

criteria are instead evaluated on different scales, besides the capacity,
preference parameters include the common scale on which the evaluations of

which ULX form are poorly understood, but recent evidence suggests they may be
more common in low metallicity systems. Here we investigate the hypothesis that
ULX form preferentially in low metallicity galaxies by searching for ULX in a
sample of Extremely Metal Poor Galaxies (XMPG) observed with the Chandra X-ray
Observatory. XMPG are defined as galaxies with log(O/H)+12<7.65, or less than
5% solar. These are the most metal-deficient galaxies known, and a logical
place to find ULX if they favor metal poor systems. We compare the number of
ULX (corrected for background contamination) per unit of star formation (Nulx)
in the XMPG sample with Nulx in a comparison sample of galaxies with higher
metallicities taken from the Spitzer Infrared Galaxy Sample (SINGS). We find
that ULX occur preferentially in the metal poor sample with a formal
statistical significance of 2.3 sigma. We do not see strong evidence for a
trend in the formation of ULX in the high metallicity sample: above 12+log(O/H)
~ 8.0 the efficiency of ULX production appears to be flat. The effect we see is
strongest in the lowest metallicity bin. We discuss briefly the implications of
these results for the formation of black holes in low metallicity gas.

singularity within an intuitive formalism based on Wannier-function
localization and analytically prove Wigner-Seitz truncation to be the ideal

the number of k-points used to sample the Brillouin zone for all but
zero-temperature metallic systems. To facilitate the implementation of this

compare several regularization methods for the exchange kernel in a variety of

chiral magnetic materials without spatial inversion symmetry, and have
attracted enormous attention due to their promising application in spintronics
since only a low applied current is necessary to drive their motion. When a
conduction electron moves around the skyrmion, its spin is fully polarized by
the spin texture and acquires a quantized phase; thus, the skyrmion yields an
emergent electrodynamics that in turn determines skyrmion motion and gives rise
to a finite Hall angle. While Skyrmions behave as particles, no particle level
description of their dynamics exists to date. Such a model would have
tremendous impact on understanding skyrmion dynamics by theoretical analysis
and computational modeling. Here we derive the equation of motion from a
microscopic continuum model and obtain the short-range interaction between
skyrmions, and the interaction between skyrmions and defects. Skyrmions also
experience a Magnus force perpendicular to their velocity due to the underlying
emergent electromagnetic field. We validate the equation of motion by studying
the depinning transition using both the particle and the continuum models. By
using the particle description, we explain the recent experimental observations
of the rotation of a skyrmion lattice in the presence of a temperature
gradient. We also predict quantum and thermal creep motion of skyrmions in the

the ANN forecast accuracies. The weight for each training algorithm is
determined from the performance of the corresponding ANN model on the
validation dataset. Experimental results on four important time series depicts
that our proposed technique reduces the mentioned shortcomings of individual
ANN training algorithms to a great extent. Also it achieves significantly
better forecast accuracies than two other popular statistical models.

  Barred Spiral Galaxies","Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stt354",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We have performed a series of chemodynamical simulations of barred disc
galaxies. Our goal is to determine the physical processes responsible for the
increase in the central gas-phase metallicity and of the central SFR observed
in SDSS. We define a 2kpc diameter central aperture to approximate the
integrated spectroscopic fibre measurements from the SDSS. The chemical
evolution observed within this central region depends critically upon the
relative size of the bar and the aperture, which evolves strongly with time. At
t~0.5Gyr, a strong bar forms, whose length is considerably longer than the 2kpc
aperture. The stars and gas lose angular momentum and follow elongated orbits
that cause an intense mixing of the gas between the central region and its
surroundings. During the next 1.5Gyr, the orbits of the gas contract
significantly until the entire gas bar is contained in the 2kpc aperture,
resulting in a net flux of gas into the central region. During this period, the
metallicity in the central region increases steadily, and this enrichment is
dominated by metal-rich gas that is flowing into the central region. The main
result of this work is therefore that the observed enrichment in the centres of
barred galaxies is not dominated by in-situ enrichment by stars formed in the
centre. Rather, star formation occurs along the full length of the bar, much of
which occurs initially outside the 2kpc aperture. About 50% of the metals that
end up in the central region originate from this extended bar-long star
formation, but flow into the central region due to loss of angular momentum. We
conclude that there is no direct connection between central SFR and central
metallicity. The central metallicity does not originate exclusively from
central stars. Instead, the global SFR (especially along the bar) and the
large-scale flow of enriched gas play a major role.

the powerful collision of stellar winds driven by radiation pressure on
spectral line transitions. We examine the influence of the X-rays from the
wind-wind collision shocks on the radiative driving of the stellar winds using
steady state models that include a parameterized line force with X-ray
ionization dependence. Our primary result is that X-ray radiation from the
shocks inhibits wind acceleration and can lead to a lower pre-shock velocity,
and a correspondingly lower shocked plasma temperature, yet the intrinsic X-ray
luminosity of the shocks, LX remains largely unaltered, with the exception of a
modest increase at small binary separations. Due to the feedback loop between
the ionizing X-rays from the shocks and the wind-driving, we term this scenario
as self regulated shocks. This effect is found to greatly increase the range of
binary separations at which a wind-photosphere collision is likely to occur in
systems where the momenta of the two winds are significantly different.
Furthermore, the excessive levels of X-ray ionization close to the shocks
completely suppresses the line force, and we suggest that this may render
radiative braking less effective. Comparisons of model results against
observations reveals reasonable agreement in terms of log(LX/Lbol). The
inclusion of self regulated shocks improves the match for kT values in roughly
equal wind momenta systems, but there is a systematic offset for systems with
unequal wind momenta (if considered to be a wind-photosphere collision).

metallicity gradients change with angular resolution, signal-to-noise (S/N),
and annular binning parameters. Two approaches are used: 1. We downgrade the
high angular resolution integral-field data of a gravitationally lensed galaxy
and re-derive the metallicity gradients at different angular resolution; 2. We
simulate high-redshift integral field spectroscopy (IFS) observations under
different angular resolution and S/N conditions using a local galaxy with a
known gradient. We find that the measured metallicity gradient changes
systematically with angular resolution and annular binning. Seeing-limited
observations produce significantly flatter gradients than higher angular
resolution observations. There is a critical angular resolution limit beyond
which the measured metallicity gradient is substantially different to the
intrinsic gradient. This critical angular resolution depends on the intrinsic
gradient of the galaxy and is < 0.02 arcsec for our simulated galaxy. We show
that seeing-limited high-redshift metallicity gradients are likely to be
strongly affected by resolution-driven gradient flattening. Annular binning
with a small number of annuli produces a more flattened gradient than the
intrinsic gradient due to weak line smearing. For 3-annuli bins, a minimum S/N
of ~ 5 on the [NII] line is required for the faintest annulus to constrain the

water, H2-17O and H2-18O, toward the carbon-rich AGB star IRC+10216 (a.k.a. CW
Leonis) using the HIFI instrument on the Herschel Space Observatory. This
search was motivated by the fact that any detection of isotopic enhancement in
the H2-17O and H2-18O abundances would have strongly implicated CO
photodissociation as the source of the atomic oxygen needed to produce water in
a carbon-rich circumstellar envelope. Our observations place an upper limit of
1/470 on the H2-17O/H2-16O abundance ratio. Given the isotopic 17O/16O ratio of
1/840 inferred previously for the photosphere of IRC+10216, this result places
an upper limit of a factor 1.8 on the extent of any isotope-selective
enhancement of H2-17O in the circumstellar material, and provides an important
constraint on any model that invokes CO photodissociation as the source of O
for H2O production. In the context of the clumpy photodissociation model
proposed previously for the origin of water in IRC+10216, our limit implies
that 12C-16O (not 13C-16O or SiO) must be the dominant source of 16O for H2O
production, and that the effects of self-shielding can only have reduced the
12C-16O photodissociation rate by at most a factor ~ 2.

entangled phases of quantum matter. Examples include gapped topological ordered
phases, gapless quantum spin liquids and non-fermi liquid phases. An insightful
window into such phases is provided by recent developments in the theory of
short ranged entangled Symmetry Protected Topological (SPT) phases . First they
generate useful no-go constraints on how global symmetry may be implemented in
a highly entangled phase. Possible symmetry implementation in gapped
topological phases and some proposed gapless spin/bose liquids are examined in
this light. We show that some previously proposed spin liquid states for 2d
quantum magnets do not in fact have consistent symmetry implementation unless
they occur as the surface of a 3d SPT phase. A second SPT-based insight into
highly entangled states is the development of a view point of such states as
SPT phases of one of the emergent excitations. We describe this in the specific
context of time reversal symmetric 3d U(1) quantum spin liquids with an
emergent photon. Different such spin liquids are shown to be equivalent to
different SPT insulating phases of the emergent monopole excitation of such
phases. The highly entangled states also in turn enrich our understanding of
SPT phases. We use the insights obtained from our results to provide an
explicit construction of bosonic SPT phases in 3d in a system of coupled
layers. This includes construction of a time reversal symmetric SPT state that
is not currently part of the cohomology classification of such states.

length scales for the initiation of He detonations that range between 1 -
$10^{10}$ cm. A simple estimate of the length scales over which the total
consumption of fuel will occur for steady-state detonations is provided by the
Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) formalism. Our initiation lengths are consistently smaller
than the corresponding CJ length scales by a factor of $\Sim 100$, providing
opportunities for thermonuclear explosions in a wider range of low-mass white
dwarfs (WDs) than previously thought possible. We find that virialized WDs with
as little mass as 0.24 $M_\odot$ can be detonated, and that even less massive
WDs can be detonated if a sizable fraction of their mass is raised to a higher
adiabat. That the initiation length is exceeded by the CJ length implies that
certain systems may not reach nuclear statistical equilibrium within the time
it takes a detonation to traverse the object. In support of this hypothesis, we
demonstrate that incomplete burning will occur in the majority of He WD
detonations and that $^{40}$Ca, $^{44}$Ti, or $^{48}$Cr, rather than $^{56}$Ni,

(Mbh) and host galaxy properties (velocity dispersion, bulge stellar mass and
bulge luminosity) depend on the large scale environment. For each of a sample
of 69 galaxies with dynamical black hole measurements we compile four
environmental measures (nearest neighbor distance, fixed aperture number
density, total halo mass, and central/satellite). We find that central and
satellite galaxies follow distinctly separate scalings in each of the three
relations we have examined. The Mbh - sigma relation of central galaxies is
significantly steeper (6.38 +/- 0.49) than that of satellite galaxies (4.91 +/-
0.49), but has a similar intercept. This behavior remains even after
restricting to a sample of only early type galaxies or after removing the 8
brightest cluster galaxies. The Mbh - sigma relation shows more modest
differences when splitting the sample based on the other environmental
indicators, suggesting that they are driven by the underlying satellite/central
fractions. Separate relations for centrals and satellites are also seen in the
power law scaling between black hole mass and bulge stellar mass or bulge
luminosity. We suggest that gas rich, low mass galaxies undergo a period of
rapid black hole growth in the process of becoming satellites. If central
galaxies on the current Mbh - sigma relation are representative progenitors of
the satellite population, the observations imply that a sigma = 120 km/s galaxy
must nearly triple its central black hole mass. The elevated black hole masses
of massive central galaxies are then a natural consequence of the accretion of
satellites.

We interpret this as a detection of the ionized ISM of M31 along two lines of

measurement techniques are used, including single Sersic fits, two-component
Sersic models, and a non-parametric method. Through simple simulations, we show
that the non-parametric and two-component Sersic methods provide the most
robust effective radius measurements, while those based on single Sersic
profiles are often overestimates, especially for massive red/early-type
galaxies. Using our robust sizes, we show for all sub-samples that the
mass-size relations are shallow at low stellar masses and steepen above ~ 3-4 x
10^{10}\msun. The mass-size relations for galaxies classified as late-type,
low-n, and star-forming are consistent with each other, while blue galaxies
follow a somewhat steeper relation. The mass-size relations of early-type,
high-n, red, and quiescent galaxies all agree with each other but are somewhat
steeper at the high-mass end than previous results. To test potential
systematics at high redshift, we artificially redshifted our sample (including
surface brightness dimming and degraded resolution) to z=1 and re-fit the
galaxies using single Serisc profiles. The sizes of these galaxies before and
after redshifting are consistent and we conclude that systematic effects in
sizes and the size-mass relation at z ~ 1 are negligible. Interestingly, since
the poorer physical resolution at high redshift washes out bright galaxy
substructures, single-Sersic fitting appears to provide more reliable and
unbiased effective radius measurements at high z than for nearby, well-resolved

degeneracy. We find that the Galileon model can fit the WMAP 9-year results
better than the standard \Lambda-Cold Dark Matter model, but gives a slightly

signal from the first two nights is robust, but we find no compelling
explanation for its absence in the final night. The latter suffers from
stronger noise residuals and greater instrumental instability than the first

possible that the integrated dayside emission from 51 Peg b is instead strongly
affected by weather. However, more data are required before we can claim any

radiation above 160 MeV in their rest frame. This limit is given by the balance
between the accelerating electric force and the radiation reaction force acting
on the electrons. The discovery of synchrotron gamma-ray flares in the Crab
Nebula, well above this limit, challenges this classical picture of particle
acceleration. To overcome this limit, particles must accelerate in a region of
high electric field and low magnetic field. This is possible only with a
non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic process, like magnetic reconnection. We present
the first numerical evidence of particle acceleration beyond the synchrotron
burnoff limit, using a set of 2D particle-in-cell simulations of
ultra-relativistic pair plasma reconnection. We use a new code, Zeltron, that
includes self-consistently the radiation reaction force in the equation of
motion of the particles. We demonstrate that the most energetic particles move
back and forth across the reconnection layer, following relativistic Speiser
orbits. These particles then radiate >160 MeV synchrotron radiation rapidly,
within a fraction of a full gyration, after they exit the layer. Our analysis
shows that the high-energy synchrotron flux is highly variable in time because
of the strong anisotropy and inhomogeneity of the energetic particles. We
discover a robust positive correlation between the flux and the cut-off energy
of the emitted radiation, mimicking the effect of relativistic Doppler
amplification. A strong guide field quenches the emission of >160 MeV
synchrotron radiation. Our results are consistent with the observed properties
of the Crab flares, supporting the reconnection scenario.

At the point of little rip the Hubble rate and its cosmic time derivative
approach infinity, which is quite similar to the big rip singularity except
that the former happens at infinite future while the latter at a finite cosmic
time; both events happen in the future and at high energies. In the case of the
big rip, a combination of ultra-violet and infra-red effects can smooth its
doomsday. We therefore wonder if the little rip can also be smoothed in a
similar way. We address the ultra-violet and infra-red effects in general
relativity through a brane-world model with a Gauss-Bonnet term in the bulk and
an induced gravity term on the brane. We find that the little rip is
transformed in this case into a sudden singularity, or a ""big brake"". Even
though the big brake is smoother than the little rip in that the Hubble rate is
finite at the event, the trade-off is that it takes place sooner, at a finite
cosmic time. In our estimate, the big brake would happen at roughly 1300Gyr.

measured relative to all cluster galaxies more luminous than M*_{3.6}(z)+1,
where M*_{3.6}(z) is the absolute magnitude of the break in the galaxy
luminosity function at the cluster redshift in the IRAC 3.6um bandpass. The
cluster AGN fraction is 30 times greater than the 3sigma upper limit on the
value for AGN of similar luminosity at z~0.25, as well as more than an order of
magnitude greater than the AGN fraction at z~0.75. AGN with L_{X,H} >= 10^{43}
erg/s exhibit similarly pronounced evolution with redshift. In contrast with
the local universe, where the luminous AGN fraction is higher in the field than
in clusters, the X-ray and MIR-selected AGN fractions in the field and clusters
are consistent at 1<z<1.5. This is evidence that the cluster AGN population has
evolved more rapidly than the field population from z~1.5 to the present. This

theory, including a streamlined review of previous literature on the subject.
Such long strings can appear in the form of solitonic strings, as in the 4d
Abelian Higgs model, or in the form of confining strings, as in Yang-Mills
theories. The bottom line is that upon expanding in powers of 1/L the energy
levels of long (closed) strings (where L is the length of the string), all the
terms up to (and including) order 1/L^5 are universal. We argue that for
excited strings in D>3 space-time dimensions there is a universal deviation at
order 1/L^5 from the naive formula that is usually used to fit lattice results.
For D=3 this naive formula is valid even at order 1/L^5. At order 1/L^7
non-universal terms generically appear in all cases. We explain the physical
origin of these results, and illuminate them in three different formulations of
the effective action of long strings (the relationships among which we partly
clarify). In addition, we corroborate these results by an explicit computation
of the effective action on long strings in confining theories which have a
gravitational dual. These predictions can be tested by precise simulations of
4d Yang-Mills theory on the lattice.

system, we broadly mean that small disturbances either in the system inputs or
in the initial conditions do not lead to large changes in the overall behavior

theory of stability is a vast, rapidly growing subject with prolific and
innovative contributions from numerous researchers. As such, an introductory
book that covers the basic concepts and minute details about this theory is
essential. The primary aim of this book is to make the readers familiar with
the various terminologies and methods related to the stability analysis of
time-invariant (autonomous) and time-varying (non-autonomous) systems. A
special treatment is given to the celebrated Liapunov's direct method which is
so far the most widely used and perhaps the best method for determining the
stability nature of both autonomous as well as non-autonomous systems. After
discussing autonomous systems to a considerable extent, the book concentrates
on the non-autonomous systems. From stability point of view, these systems are
often quite difficult to manage. Also, unlike their autonomous counterparts,
the non-autonomous systems often behave in peculiar manners which can make the
analysts arrive at misleading conclusions. Due to these issues, this book
attempts to present a careful and systematic study about the stability
properties of non-autonomous systems.

least one large spot group on the surface causing a 1-10% flux modulation in
the Kepler passband. By identifying and tracking spot groups over a range of
inferred latitudes, we measured the surface differential rotation to be much
smaller than that found for the Sun. We also searched for a correlation between
the seventeen stellar flares that occurred during our observations and the
orientation of the dominant surface spot at the time of each flare. No
statistically-significant correlation was found except perhaps for the very
brightest flares, suggesting most flares are associated with regions devoid of
spots or spots too small to be clearly discerned using our reconstruction
technique. While we may see hints of long-term changes in the spot
characteristics and flare statistics within our current dataset, a longer
baseline of observation will be needed to detect the existence of a magnetic
cycle in KIC 5110407.

Specifically, we carry out an analysis in terms of mobility fields and
distributions of persistence times and exchange times. In so doing, we show
that dynamics in these systems is facilitated by transient disorder in
frustrated two-dimensional hydrogen bonding networks. The frustration is the
result of unfavorable geometry imposed by strong metal-water bonding. The
geometry depends upon the structure of the underlying metal surface. Dynamic
heterogeneity of water on the Pt 111 surface is therefore qualitatively
different than that for water on the Pt 100 surface. In both cases, statistics
of this adlayer dynamic heterogeneity responds asymmetrically to applied

dynamics with running quark masses and wave function renormalization in
accordance with lattice QCD (LQCD) in vacuum. Their generalization to finite
temperature T and chemical potential \mu{} allows to reproduce the
\mu-dependence of the pseudocritical temperature from LQCD when a nonvanishing
vector meson coupling is adjusted. This restricts the region for the critical
endpoint in the QCD phase diagram and stiffens the quark matter equation of
state (EoS). It is demonstrated that the construction of a hybrid EoS for
compact star applications within a two-phase approach employing the nonlocal
PNJL EoS and an advanced hadronic EoS leads to the masquerade problem. A
density dependence of the vector meson coupling is suggested as a possible
solution which can be adjusted in a suitable way to describe hybrid stars with

creating social links: if Alice follows Bob and Bob follows Charlie, Alice will
follow Charlie. Here we present an analysis of longitudinal micro-blogging
data, revealing a more nuanced view of the strategies employed by users when
expanding their social circles. While the network structure affects the spread
of information among users, the network is in turn shaped by this communication
activity. This suggests a link creation mechanism whereby Alice is more likely
to follow Charlie after seeing many messages by Charlie. We characterize users
with a set of parameters associated with different link creation strategies,
estimated by a Maximum-Likelihood approach. Triadic closure does have a strong
effect on link formation, but shortcuts based on traffic are another key factor
in interpreting network evolution. However, individual strategies for following
other users are highly heterogeneous. Link creation behaviors can be summarized
by classifying users in different categories with distinct structural and
behavioral characteristics. Users who are popular, active, and influential tend
to create traffic-based shortcuts, making the information diffusion process
more efficient in the network.

since Erd\H{o}s' famous proof in 1947 that the 'diagonal' Ramsey numbers $R(k)$
grow exponentially in $k$. In the early 1990s, the triangle-free process was
introduced as a model which might potentially provide good lower bounds for the
'off-diagonal' Ramsey numbers $R(3,k)$. In this model, edges of $K_n$ are
introduced one-by-one at random and added to the graph if they do not create a
triangle; the resulting final (random) graph is denoted $G_{n,\triangle}$. In
2009, Bohman succeeded in following this process for a positive fraction of its
duration, and thus obtained a second proof of Kim's celebrated result that
$R(3,k) = \Theta \big( k^2 / \log k \big)$.
  In this paper we improve the results of both Bohman and Kim, and follow the
triangle-free process all the way to its asymptotic end. In particular, we
shall prove that $$e\big( G_{n,\triangle} \big) \,=\, \left(
\frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}} + o(1) \right) n^{3/2} \sqrt{\log n },$$ with high
probability as $n \to \infty$. We also obtain several pseudorandom properties
of $G_{n,\triangle}$, and use them to bound its independence number, which
gives as an immediate corollary $$R(3,k) \, \ge \, \left( \frac{1}{4} - o(1)
\right) \frac{k^2}{\log k}.$$ This significantly improves Kim's lower bound,
and is within a factor of $4 + o(1)$ of the best known upper bound, proved by
Shearer over 25 years ago.

an anomalous increase as temperature decreases. The thermal diffusivity, i. e.,
the ratio of the thermal conductivity and the heat capacity per unit volume,
shows a decrease. These anomalies may be associated with a hypothetical
liquid-liquid critical point in supercooled water below the line of homogeneous
nucleation. However, while the thermal conductivity is known to diverge at the
vapor-liquid critical point due to critical density fluctuations, the thermal
conductivity of supercooled water, calculated as the product of thermal
diffusivity and heat capacity, does not show any sign of such an anomaly. We
have used mode-coupling theory to investigate the possible effect of critical
fluctuations on the thermal conductivity of supercooled water, and found that
indeed any critical thermal-conductivity enhancement would be too small to be
measurable at experimentally accessible temperatures. Moreover, the behavior of
thermal conductivity can be explained by the observed anomalies of the
thermodynamic properties. In particular, we show that thermal conductivity
should go through a minimum as temperature is decreased, as Kumar and Stanley
observed in the TIP5P model of water. We discuss physical reasons for the
striking difference between the behavior of thermal conductivity in water near
the vapor-liquid and liquid-liquid critical points.

Half of the 18 novae belong to the Fe II class, with the remaining nine

studies of M31 and M33, the He/N and Fe IIb novae have on average faster

novae have faster rates of decline than do novae in the Galaxy and M31. It
appears that the increased fraction of faster, He/N and Fe IIb novae observed

the underlying stellar population between the two galaxies. We propose that the
younger population seen in the LMC compared with M31's bulge (where most of the

that the presheaves of plain, derived and stable representations all form
stacks on the category of finite $G$-sets (or the orbit category of $G$), with
respect to a suitable Grothendieck topology that we call the sipp topology.

noncoherent solutions. In this paper, turbo-coded orthogonal multi-tone
frequency-shift keying (FSK) is considered for the two-way relay channel. In
contrast with analog network coding, the system considered is an instance of
digital network coding; i.e., the relay decodes the network codeword and
forwards a re-encoded version. Crucial to noncoherent digital network coding is
the implementation of the relay receiver, which is the primary focus of the
paper. The relay receiver derived in this paper supports any modulation order
that is a power of two, and features the iterative feedback of a priori
information from the turbo channel decoder to the demodulator; i.e., it uses
bit interleaved coded modulation with iterative decoding (BICM-ID). The
performance of the receiver is investigated in Rayeligh fading channels through
error-rate simulations and a capacity analysis. Results show that the BICM-ID

phylogenetic uncertainty affects a commonly used method (MEDUSA, modelling
evolutionary diversity using stepwise AIC) for estimating shifts in
diversification rates in lineages of the family Nymphalidae, by extending the
method to run across a random sample of phylogenetic trees from the posterior
distribution of a Bayesian run. We found that phylogenetic uncertainty greatly
affects diversification rate estimates. Different trees from the posterior
distribution can give diversification rates ranging from high values to almost
zero for the same clade, and for some clades both significant rate increase and
decrease were estimated. Only three out of 13 significant shifts found on the
maximum credibility tree were consistent across more than 95% of the trees from
the posterior: (i) accelerated diversification for Solanaceae feeders in the
tribe Ithomiini; (ii) accelerated diversification in the genus Charaxes, and
(iii) deceleration in the Danaina. By using the binary speciation and
extinction model (BISSE), we found that a hostplant shift to Solanaceae or a
codistributed character is responsible for the increase in diversification rate
in Ithomiini, and the result is congruent with the diffuse cospeciation
hypothesis. A shift to Apocynaceae is not responsible for the slowdown of
diversification in Danaina. Our results show that taking phylogenetic
uncertainty into account when estimating diversification rate shifts is of
great importance, and relying on the maximum credibility tree alone potentially

binary merger channel, the progenitor binary of VFTS102 would evolve into
contact while two components are still on the main sequence, and then merge
into a rapidly rotating single star. Employing Eggleton's stellar evolution
code, we performed binary stellar evolution calculations and mapped out the
initial parameters of the progenitor of VFTS102 in the orbital period-mass
ratio ($P-q$) plane. We found that the progenitor binary of VFTS102 with
initial mass ratio $q_0 \la 0.7$ should have an initial orbital period shorter
than $3.76-4.25$\,days, while above this mass ratio it should have an initial
orbital period shorter than $1.44-1.55$\,days. The progenitor of VFTS102 would
evolve into contact during the rapid mass transfer phase or during the
subsequent slow mass transfer phase, and might ultimately merge into a rapidly
rotating massive star. In addition, we performed Monte Carlo simulations to
investigate the binary merger channel. We estimated the fraction of binaries
that would merge into single stars and the fraction of single stars that might
be produced from the binary merger channel. It is found that about 8.7% of
binaries would evolve into contact and merge into rapidly rotating single
stars, and about 17.1% of single stars might be produced from the binary merger
channel and should have similar properties to VFTS102. This suggests that the
binary merger channel might be one of the main channels for the formation of
rapidly rotating massive stars like VFTS102.

to date fully relativistic simulations of BHNS binaries have included
black-hole spins only up to $S/M^2$=0.9, which corresponds to the black hole

accretion disk and the largest tidal tail outflow of any fully relativistic
BHNS simulations to date, even exceeding the results implied by extrapolating
results from simulations with lower black-hole spin. The disk appears to be
remarkably stable. We also find that the high black-hole spin persists until
shortly before the time of merger; afterwards, both merger and accretion spin
down the black hole.

  ultra-compact binaries","6 pages, 4 figures",,,,"astro-ph.SR astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The quasi-periodic feature of 1-10 years exhibited in pulsar timing noise has
not been well understood since 1980. The recently demonstrated correlation
between timing noise and variation of pulse profile motivates us to further
investigate its origins. We suggest that the quasi-periodicity feature of
timing noise, with rapid oscillations lying on lower frequency structure, comes
from the geodetic precession of an unseen binary system, which induces
additional motion of the pulsar spin axis. The resultant change of azimuth and
latitude at which the observer's line of sight crosses the emission beam is
responsible for the variation of timing noise and pulse profile respectively.
The first numerical simulation to both timing noise and pulse profile variation
are thus performed, from which the orbital periods of these pulsars are of 1-35
minutes. Considering the existence of the ultracompact binary white dwarf of
orbital period of 5.4 minute, HM Cancri, such orbital periods to pulsar
binaries are not strange. The change of latitude of the magnetic moment
exceeding the range of emission beam of a pulsar results in the intermittency,
which explains the behavior of PSR B1931+24. Therefore, it provides not only a
mechanism of the quasi-periodic feature displayed on some ``singular"" pulsars,
like timing noise, variation of pulse profile and intermittency; but also a new
approach of searching ultra-compact binaries, possibly pulsar-black hole binary
systems.

both reciprocal edges (i.e., edges that have already been linked back) and
parasocial edges (i.e., edges that haven't been linked back). Thus,
understanding the structures and evolutions of reciprocal edges and parasocial
ones, exploring the factors that influence parasocial edges to become
reciprocal ones, and predicting whether a parasocial edge will turn into a
reciprocal one are basic research problems.
  However, there have been few systematic studies about such problems. In this
paper, we bridge this gap using a novel large-scale Google+ dataset crawled by
ourselves as well as one publicly available social network dataset. First, we
compare the structures and evolutions of reciprocal edges and those of
parasocial edges. For instance, we find that reciprocal edges are more likely
to connect users with similar degrees while parasocial edges are more likely to
link ordinary users (e.g., users with low degrees) and popular users (e.g.,
celebrities). However, the impacts of reciprocal edges linking ordinary and
popular users on the network structures increase slowly as the social networks
evolve. Second, we observe that factors including user behaviors, node
attributes, and edge attributes all have significant impacts on the formation
of reciprocal edges. Third, in contrast to previous studies that treat
reciprocal edge prediction as either a supervised or a semi-supervised learning
problem, we identify that reciprocal edge prediction is better modeled as an
outlier detection problem. Finally, we perform extensive evaluations with the
two datasets, and we show that our proposal outperforms previous reciprocal
edge prediction approaches.

architectures are not designed for security and forensics. To date, very little
research has been done to develop the theory and practice of cloud forensics.
Many factors complicate forensic investigations in a cloud environment. First,
the storage system is no longer local. Therefore, even with a subpoena, law
enforcement agents cannot confiscate the suspect's computer and get access to
the suspect's files. Second, each cloud server contains files from many users.
Hence, it is not feasible to seize servers from a data center without violating
the privacy of many other users. Third, even if the data belonging to a
particular suspect is identified, separating it from other users' data is
difficult. Moreover, other than the cloud provider's word, there is usually no
evidence that links a given data file to a particular suspect. For such
challenges, clouds cannot be used to store healthcare, business, or national
security related data, which require audit and regulatory compliance. In this

molecular isotopic ratios 140 6 14N/15N 6 250 and 140 6 14N/15N 6 360,
respectively. The range of values reflect genuine spatial variations within the
cores. A comprehensive analysis of the available measurements of the nitrogen
isotopic ratio in prestellar cores show that molecules carrying the nitrile
functional group appear to be systematically 15N-enriched com- pared to those
carrying the amine functional group. A chemical origin for the differential
15N-enhance- ment between nitrile- and amine-bearing interstellar molecules is
proposed. This sheds new light on several observations of Solar System objects:
(i) the similar N isotopic fractionation in Jupiter's NH3 and solar wind N+;
(ii) the 15N-enrichments in cometary HCN and CN (that might represent a direct
inter- stellar inheritance); and (iii) 15N-enrichments observed in organics in
primitive cosmomaterials. The large variations in the isotopic composition of
N-bearing molecules in Solar System objects might then simply reflect the
different interstellar N reservoirs from which they are originating.

Specifically we tackle the question: Which class of first-order term graphs

homomorphism-based sharing-order on lambda-ho-term-graphs is preserved and
reflected, and (ii) the image of the embedding corresponds closely to a natural

  We systematically examine whether a number of classes of lambda-term-graphs

satisfies this criterion. Term graphs of this class are built from application,
abstraction, variable, and scope-delimiter vertices, and have the
characteristic feature that the latter two kinds of vertices have back-links to

Spatial data consists of values that denote the location and shape of objects
and areas on the earths surface. Spatial information includes facts such as
location of features, the relationship of geographic features and measurements
of geographic features. The spatial cognition is a primal area of study in
various other fields such as Robotics, Psychology, Geosciences, Geography,
Political Sciences, Geographic Economy, Environmental, Mining and Petroleum
Engineering, Natural Resources, Epidemiology, Demography etc., Any text
document which contains physical location specifications such as place names,
geographic coordinates, landmarks, country names etc., are supposed to contain
the spatial information. The spatial information may also be represented using
vague or fuzzy descriptions involving linguistic terms such as near to, far
from, to the east of, very close. Given a query involving events, the aim of
this ongoing research work is to extract the relevant information from multiple
text documents, resolve the uncertainty and vagueness and translate them in to
locations in a map. The input to the system would be a text Corpus and a
Spatial Query event. The output of the system is a map showing the most
possible, disambiguated location of the event queried. The author proposes
Fuzzy Logic Techniques for resolving the uncertainty in the spatial
expressions.

Every subnetwork of $f$ has a unique fixed point if and only if $f$ has no

theorem of Shih and Dong, which asserts that if for every $x$ in $\{0,1\}^n$
there is no directed cycle in the directed graph whose the adjacency matrix is
the discrete Jacobian matrix of $f$ evaluated at point $x$, then $f$ has a
unique fixed point. Then, denoting by $\mathcal{C}^+$ (resp. $\mathcal{C}^-$)

partial surface oxidation of the former to the corresponding Fe@FexOy
core@shell domains. HNCs with variable population and size of the Fe-based
nanodomains could be synthesized depending on the surface reactivity of the ZnO

studied. In HNCs characterized by a large number of small Fe@FexOy core@shell
nanodomains on the ZnO seed surface, the interfacial communication across the
Fe-core and FexOy-shell generated a sizeable exchange-bias effect mediated by
frozen interfacial spins. On the other hand, in HNCs carrying a lower density
of comparatively larger Fe@FexOy domains, partial removal of the Fe core
created an inner void in-between that led to suppressed exchange coupling
anisotropy. As a further proof of functionality, the HNCs exhibited pronounced
band-edge ultraviolet fluorescence. The latter was blue-shifted compared to the
parent ZnO NRs, inferring coupling of the semiconductor and magnet sections.

J1549$-$4848 in our Spitzer survey of a few middle-aged radio pulsars.
Following the discovery, multi-wavelength imaging and spectroscopic
observations of the nebula were carried out. We detected the nebula in Spitzer
IRAC 8.0, MIPS 24 and 70 $\mu$m imaging and in Spitzer IRS 7.5--14.4 $\mu$m
spectroscopic observations, and also in the WISE all-sky survey at 12 and 22
$\mu$m.These data were analyzed in detail, and we find that the nebula can be
described with a standard bow-shock shape, and that its spectrum contains
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and H$_2$ emission features. However, it is not
certain which object drives the nebula. We analyze the field stars and conclude
that none of them can be the associated object because stars with a strong wind
or mass ejection that usually produce bow shocks are much brighter than the
field stars. The pulsar is approximately 15\arcsec\ away from the region in
which the associated object is expected to be located. In order to resolve the
discrepancy, we suggest that a highly collimated wind could be emitted from the
pulsar and produce the bow shock. X-ray imaging to detect the interaction of
the wind with the ambient medium and high-spatial resolution radio imaging to
determine the proper motion of the pulsar should be carried out, which will
help verify the association of the pulsar with the bow shock nebula.

stacks of global G-shtukas, the function field analogs for Shimura varieties.
Here G is a flat affine group scheme of finite type over a smooth projective
curve C over a finite field. Global G-shtukas are generalizations of Drinfeld
shtukas and analogs of abelian varieties with additional structure. We prove
that the moduli stacks of global G-shtukas are algebraic Deligne-Mumford stacks
separated and locally of finite type. They generalize various moduli spaces
used by different authors to prove instances of the Langlands program over
function fields. In the first article we explained the relation between global
G-shtukas and local P-shtukas, which are the function field analogs of
p-divisible groups. Here P is the base change of G to the complete local ring
at a point of C. When P is smooth with connected reductive generic fiber we
proved the existence of Rapoport-Zink spaces for local P-shtukas. In the
present article we use these spaces to (partly) uniformize the moduli stacks of
global G-shtukas for smooth G with connected fibers and reductive generic
fiber. This is our main result. It has applications to the analog of the
Langlands-Rapoport conjecture for our moduli stacks.

ciphertext attack (IND-CCA2) is a challenge problem. To the date, full
CCA2-security of all proposed lattice-based PKE schemes achieved by using a
generic transformations such as either strongly unforgeable one-time signature
schemes (SU-OT-SS), or a message authentication code (MAC) and weak form of
commitment. The drawback of these schemes is that encryption requires ""separate
encryption"". Therefore, the resulting encryption scheme is not sufficiently
efficient to be used in practice and it is inappropriate for many applications
such as small ubiquitous computing devices with limited resources such as smart
cards, active RFID tags, wireless sensor networks and other embedded devices.
  In this work, for the first time, we introduce an efficient universal random
data padding (URDP) scheme, and show how it can be used to construct a ""direct""
CCA2-secure encryption scheme from ""any"" worst-case hardness problems in
(ideal) lattice in the standard model, resolving a problem that has remained
open till date. This novel approach is a ""black-box"" construction and leads to
the elimination of separate encryption, as it avoids using general
transformation from CPA-secure scheme to a CCA2-secure one. IND-CCA2 security
of this scheme can be tightly reduced in the standard model to the assumption
that the underlying primitive is an one-way trapdoor function.

service providers matter due to the lack of faceto- face interactions,
uncertainty, intangibility, hyper competition, increasing risk of fraud and
lack of trust. Relationship quality (RQ) is replacing service quality as a key
source of superior performance and competitive advantage. Accordingly, this
study investigates the dimensions of relationship quality from e-Banking
services and explores the differences among customers of Jordanian and foreign
banks. Many of the foreign banks in Jordan are equipped with large financial
capital, having high banking and financial experiences and are offering many
modern hi-tech banking services. This situation makes Jordanian banks in front
of unprecedented competition and so they have invested heavily to develop their
e-banking services, in order to strengthening their relationships with existing
customers, enhancing their trust, letting them satisfied, ensuring their
commitment and attracting of new ones. This paper aims to identify the key
dimensions that shape the relationship quality among Jordanian and foreign
banks and their customers who are utilizing the e-Banking services. Based on an
extensive review of relevant literature, we have formulated nine hypotheses and
identified three factors (satisfaction, trust, and commitment) that may affect
the competitiveness and success of Jordanian and foreign banks. Survey data
from 350 customers from four Jordanian banks and four foreign banks in Amman
city the capital of Jordan were collected and used to test the proposed
hypotheses. Based on the structural equation modeling and Ttest analyses, our

multidimensional space-times with symmetric connections and their reductions to
two-dimensional dilaton - vecton gravity field theories (DVG). The distinctive
feature of these theories is the presence of an absolutely neutral massive (or
tachyonic) vector field (vecton) with essentially nonlinear coupling to the
dilaton gravity (DG). We show that in DVG the vecton field can be consistently
replaced by an effectively massive scalar field (scalaron) with an unusual
coupling to dilaton gravity. With this vecton - scalaron duality, one can use
methods and results of the standard DG coupled to usual scalars (DGS) in more
complex dilaton - scalaron gravity theories (DSG) equivalent to DVG. We present
the DVG models derived by reductions of multidimensional affine theories and
obtain one-dimensional dynamical systems simultaneously describing cosmological
and static states in any gauge. Our approach is fully applicable to studying
static and cosmological solutions in multidimensional theories as well as in
general one-dimensional DGS models. We focus on global properties of the
models, look for integrals and analyze the structure of the solution spaces. In
integrable cases, it can be usefully visualized by drawing a `topological
portrait' resembling phase portraits of dynamical systems and simply exposing
global properties of static and cosmological solutions, including horizons,
singularities, etc. For analytic approximations we also propose an integral
equation well suited for iterations.

naturally in systems of hybrid particles, such as exciton-polaritons, where it
is not obvious which transport channel dominates the coupled system. Here we
address the question of whether the coupling between a strongly and a weakly
disordered channel will result in localized (insulating) or delocalized
(metallic) behavior. Complementing an earlier study in 1D [H. Y. Xie, V. E.
Kravtsov, and M. M\""uller, Phys. Rev. B \textbf{86} 014205 (2012)], the problem
is solved here on a bilayer Bethe lattice with parametrically different
parameters. The comparison with the analytical solution in 1D shows that
dimensionality plays a crucial role. In D=1 localization is in general
dominated by the dirtier channel, which sets the backscattering rate. In
contrast, on the Bethe lattice a delocalized channel remains almost always
delocalized, even when coupled to strongly localized channels. We conjecture
that this phenomenology holds true for finite dimensions $D>2$ as well.
Possible implications for interacting many-body systems are discussed.

dynamics occurs at length scales that are 1/D times smaller than the horizon

separation of scales at large D, which is due to the large gradient of the

It exhibits the
physical mechanism underlying shape perception for weakly electric fish. These
fish orient themselves at night in complete darkness by employing their active
electrolocation system. They generate a stable, high-frequency, weak electric
field and perceive the transdermal potential modulations caused by a nearby
target with different admittivity than the surrounding water. In this paper, we
explain how weakly electric fish might identify and classify a target, knowing
by advance that the latter belongs to a certain collection of shapes. Our model
of the weakly electric fish relies on differential imaging, i.e., by forming an
image from the perturbations of the field due to targets, and physics-based
classification. The electric fish would first locate the target using a
specific location search algorithm. Then it could extract, from the
perturbations of the electric field, generalized (or high-order) polarization
tensors of the target. Computing, from the extracted features, invariants under
rigid motions and scaling yields shape descriptors. The weakly electric fish
might classify a target by comparing its invariants with those of a set of
learned shapes. On the other hand, when measurements are taken at multiple
frequencies, the fish might exploit the shifts and use the spectral content of
the generalized polarization tensors to dramatically improve the stability with
respect to measurement noise of the classification procedure in
electro-sensing. Surprisingly, it turns out that the first-order polarization
tensor at multiple frequencies could be enough for the purpose of
classification. A procedure to eliminate the background field in the case where
the permittivity of the surrounding medium can be neglected, and hence improve
further the stability of the classification process, is also discussed.

susceptible-infected-susceptible model are studied on long-range connected
networks in the presence of random transition rates by means of a strong
disorder renormalization group method and Monte Carlo simulations. We focus on
the case where the connection probability decays with the distance $l$ as
$p(l)\simeq\beta l^{-2}$ in one dimension. Here, the graph dimension of the
network can be continuously tuned with $\beta$. The critical behavior of the
models is found to be described by an infinite randomness fixed point which
manifests itself in logarithmic dynamical scaling. Estimates of the complete
set of the critical exponents, which are found to vary with the graph
dimension, are provided by different methods. According to the results, the
additional disorder of transition rates does not alter the infinite randomness
critical behavior induced by the disordered topology of the underlying random
network. This finding opens up the possibility of the application of an
alternative tool, the strong disorder renormalization group method to dynamical
processes on topologically disordered structures. As the random
transverse-field Ising model falls into the same universality class as the
random contact process, the results can be directly transferred to that model
defined on the same networks.

applications within algebraic geometry and beyond. Following from his original
work in 1988, McCallum presented an improved algorithm, CADW, which offered a
huge increase in the practical utility of CAD. In 2009 a team based at the
University of Western Ontario presented a new and quite separate algorithm for
CAD, which was implemented and included in the computer algebra system Maple.
As part of a wider project at Bath investigating CAD and its applications,
Collins and McCallum's CAD algorithms have been implemented in Maple. This
report details these implementations and compares them to Qepcad and the
Ontario algorithm.
  The implementations were originally undertaken to facilitate research into
the connections between the algorithms. However, the ability of the code to
guarantee order-invariant output has led to its use in new research on CADs
which are minimal for certain problems. In addition, the implementation
described here is of interest as the only full implementation of CADW, (since
Qepcad does not currently make use of McCallum's delineating polynomials), and
hence can solve problems not admissible to other CAD implementations.

packed densely to form triads of close-packed, mutually touching spheres, in

spheres, which involves manipulating the positions of a few spheres to create a
template for the deposition process. The findings show that it is possible to
discover new structures through varying only the configuration of few spheres
within the template, where this approach relies on a sensitive dependence of
the deposition-generated structures on the template.

a number of oscillations before it quantum mechanically tunnels to the bounce

characteristic regimes: a bright flash, occurring within 100 ns after the pulse
(when the discharge emission increases by 2-3 orders of magnitude over the
steady-state level), and a dark phase, lasting a few hundreds \mu s (when the
intensity of the discharge emission drops significantly below the steady-state
level). The electron density increases during the flash and remains very large
at the dark phase. 1D3V particle-in-cell simulations qualitatively reproduce
both regimes and allow for detailed analysis of the underlying mechanisms. It
is found that the high-voltage nanosecond pulse is capable of removing a
significant fraction of plasma electrons out of the discharge gap, and that the
flash is the result of the excitation of gas atoms, triggered by residual
electrons accelerated in the electric field of immobile bulk ions. The
secondary emission from the electrodes due to vacuum UV radiation plays an
important role at this stage. High-density plasma generated during the flash
provides efficient screening of the RF field (which sustains the steady-state
plasma). This leads to the electron cooling and, hence, onset of the dark

attached, while still preserving the structural integrity of the building block
itself. This leads to a toolbox of CrSi$_{20}$H$_{20-2n}$ monomers with

illustrate that such aggregates conserve the high spin moments of the dopant

structural completion of the individual endohedral cages within the

some of the nice prop- erties of cold inflation is preserved, in cyclic
inflationary models thermal excitations are continually produced and there
exists a unique opportunity of imprinting interesting thermal history in CMBR.
In particular, we will see that a phase transition can lead to observably large
higher order nongaus- sianities as the critical temperature is approached, and
that these are increasingly divergent with the order of the correlations.

The two compounds present very different ground states: Er2Ti2O7, which has a
planar crystal field anisotropy, is an antiferromagnet with T_N=1.2K, whereas
Tb2Ti2O7 is expected to have Ising character and shows no magnetic ordering
down to 0.05K, being thus labelled a ``spin liquid''. Our model is a mean field
self-consistent calculation involving the 4 rare earth sites of a tetrahedron,
the building unit of the pyrochlore lattice. It includes the full crystal field
hamiltonian, the infinite range dipolar interaction and anisotropic nearest
neighbour exchange described by a 3-component tensor. For Er2Ti2O7, we discuss
the equivalence of our treatment of the exchange tensor, taken to be diagonal
in a frame linked to a rare earth - rare earth bond, with the pseudo-spin
hamiltonian recently developped for Kramers doublets in a pyrochlore lattice.
In Tb2Ti2O7, an essential ingredient of our model is a symmetry breaking
developping at very low temperature. We compare its prediction for the
isothermal magnetisation with that of ``the quantum spin ice'' model.

organisms are expected to be generated by a common process (e.g. the coalescent
process), it is well-known that numerous other coexisting processes (e.g.
horizontal gene transfers, gene duplication and subsequent
neofunctionalization) will cause some genes to exhibit a history quite distinct
from those of the majority of genes. Such ""outlying"" gene trees are considered
to be biologically interesting and identifying these genes has become an
important problem in phylogenetics.
  Results: We propose and implement KDETREES, a nonparametric method of
estimating distributions of phylogenetic trees, with the goal of identifying
trees which are significantly different from the rest of the trees in the
sample. Our method compares favorably with a similar recently-published method,
featuring an improvement of one polynomial order of computational complexity
(to quadratic in the number of trees analyzed), with simulation studies
suggesting only a small penalty to classification accuracy. Application of
KDETREES to a set of Apicomplexa genes identified several unreliable sequence
alignments which had escaped previous detection, as well as a gene
independently reported as a possible case of horizontal gene transfer. We also
analyze a set of Epichloe genes, fungi symbiotic with grasses, successfully
identifying a contrived instance of paralogy.

outlying trees is implemented as the R package KDETREES, and is available for
download from CRAN.

consists of seven homologous Sirt-s having structurally similar cores but
different terminal segments, being rather variable in length and/or
intrinsically disordered. Many studies have determined their cellular location
as well as biological functions although molecular mechanisms through which
they act are actually little known. Therefore, the aim of this work was to
define, explore and understand the Sirtuin-related human interactome. As a
first step, we have integrated the experimentally determined protein-protein
interactions of the Sirtuin-family as well as their first and second neighbors
to a Sirtuin-related sub-interactome. Our data showed that the second-neighbor
network of Sirtuins encompasses 25% of the entire human interactome, exhibits a
scale-free degree distribution and interconnectedness among top degree nodes.
Moreover, the Sirtuin sub interactome showed a modular structure around the
core comprising mixed functions. Finally, we extracted from the Sirtuin
sub-interactome subnets related to cancer, aging and post-translational
modifications for information on key nodes and topological space of the subnets

energy to the Fermi level of the metallic leads. Their degeneracy is broken
when the molecule is contacted to the leads, giving rise to two resonances
which become pinned close to the Fermi level and display destructive
interference.

charmonium decays \eta_c -> \Lambda \Lambda, \chi_{c0} -> \Lambda\Lambda and
J/\Psi -> \Lambda\Lambda. We develop a new formulation of the Bell's inequality
represented with particles' momenta which can be measured definitely in
experiment and seek if it violates in these decays. It is illustrated that the
\eta_c channel and the \chi_{c0} channel maximally violate Bell's inequality,
while the J/\Psi channel gives no inconsistency with it. Simulations dealing
with experimental aspects are also implemented. The expected statistical
fluctuations and achievable significance are estimated as a function of sample
size.

lasing regime due to formation of a polariton condensate, while its shape can
become non-Lorentzian owing to interaction-induced spin decoherence.

the iron-based superconductor BaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$ over a broad
isoelectron phosphorus substitution range from $x$=0 to $x$=0.60, from
non-superconducting parent compound to heavily overdoped superconducting
composition with $T_c\approx 10 K$. The features due to structural and magnetic
transitions are clearly resolved in $\rho_c(T)$ of the underdoped crystals. A
characteristic maximum in $\rho_c(T)$, found in the parent BaFe$_2$As$_2$ at
around 200 K, moves rapidly with phosphorus substitution to high temperatures.
At the optimal doping, the inter-plane resistivity shows $T$-linear temperature
dependence without any cross-over anomalies, similar to the previously reported
in-plane resistivity. This observation is in stark contrast with dissimilar
temperature dependences found at optimal doping in electron-doped
Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$. Our finding suggests that despite similar
values of the resistivity and its anisotropy, the temperature dependent
transport in the normal state is very different in electron and isoelectron
doped compounds. Similar temperature dependence of both in-plane and
inter-plane resistivities, in which the dominant contributions are coming from
different parts of the Fermi surface, suggests that scattering is the same on
the whole Fermi surface. Since magnetic fluctuations are expected to be much
stronger on the quasi-nested sheets, this observation may point to the
importance of the inter-orbital scattering between different sheets.

event-by-event fluctuations, the influence of jets can explain quantitatively
the ratio v_4/v_2^2 at p_T < 2 GeV/c for both energies and qualitatively the

approach is a modelling solution often proposed. Complexity can also be due to
external events or internal to systems, whose main characteristics are
uncertainty, imprecision, or whose perception is subjective (i.e. interpreted).
Insofar as fuzzy logic provides a solution for modelling uncertainty, the
concept of fuzzy agent can model both the complexity and uncertainty. This
paper focuses on introducing the concept of fuzzy agent: a classical
architecture of agent is redefined according to a fuzzy perspective. A
pedagogical illustration of fuzzy agentification of a smart watering system is
then proposed.

G29.96-0.02 is a high-mass star-forming cloud observed at 70, 160,
250, 350, and 500 microns as part of the Herschel survey of the Galactic Plane
during the Science Demonstration Phase. Aims. We wish to conduct a far-infrared
study of the sources associated with this star-forming region by estimating
their physical properties and evolutionary stage, and investigating the clump
mass function, the star formation efficiency and rate in the cloud. Methods. We
have identified the Hi-GAL sources associated with the cloud, searched for
possible counterparts at centimeter and infrared wavelengths, fitted their
spectral energy distribution and estimated their physical parameters. Results.
A total of 198 sources have been detected in all 5 Hi-GAL bands, 117 of which
are associated with 24 microns emission and 87 of which are not associated with
24 microns emission. We called the former sources 24 microns-bright and the
latter ones 24 microns-dark. The [70-160] color of the 24 microns-dark sources
is smaller than that of the 24 microns-bright ones. The 24 microns-dark sources
have lower L_bol and L_bol/M_env than the 24 microns-bright ones for similar
M_env, which suggests that they are in an earlier evolutionary phase. The
G29-SFR cloud is associated with 10 NVSS sources and with extended centimeter
continuum emission well correlated with the 70 microns emission. Most of the
NVSS sources appear to be early B or late O-type stars. The most massive and
luminous Hi-GAL sources in the cloud are located close to the G29-UC region,
which suggests that there is a privileged area for massive star formation
towards the center of the G29-SFR cloud. Almost all the Hi-GAL sources have
masses well above the Jeans mass but only 5% have masses above the virial mass,
which indicates that most of the sources are stable against gravitational
collapse. The sources with M_env > M_virial and that ...

which are one order smaller in the normalised Larmor radius, compared with the
derivative of the eikonal. The mechanism, therefore, does not introduce an
inhomogeneity in the radial direction, in contrast with the effect of profile
shearing. Numerical simulations of the linear ion temperature gradient mode
with adiabatic electrons, retaining the finite rho* effects in the ExB

found to be linear in the normalised Larmor radius (\rho*) but is,

surface, and increases with increasing magnetic shear, safety factor, and

processes occurring in high-energy hadron-hadron collisions, for example at the
LHC, are studied in the valence quark region, within constituent quark models.
In this framework, two particle correlations are present without any additional
prescription, at variance with what happens, for example, in independent
particle models, such as the MIT bag model in its simplest version. From the
present analysis, conclusions similar to the ones obtained recenty in a
modified version of the bag model can be drawn: correlations in the
longitudinal momenta of the active quarks are found to be sizable, while those
in transverse momentum are much smaller. However, the used framework allows to
understand clearly the dynamical origin of the correlations. In particular, it
is shown that the small size of the correlations in transverse momentum is a
model dependent result, which would not occur if models with sizable quark
orbital angular momentum were used to describe the proton. Our analysis permits
therefore to clarify the dynamical origin of the double parton correlations and
to establish which, among the features of the results, are model independent.

existence of magnetic white dwarfs is the merger of a binary white dwarf
system, as there are viable mechanisms for producing sustainable magnetic
fields within the merger product. However, the lack of rapid rotators in the
magnetic white dwarf population has been always considered a problematic issue
of this scenario. Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics simulations show that in
mergers in which the two white dwarfs have different masses a disc around the
central compact object is formed. If the central object is magnetized it can
interact with the disc through its magnetosphere. The torque applied by the
disc changes the spin of the star, whereas the transferred angular momentum
from the star to the disc determines the properties of the disc. In this work
we build a model for the disc evolution under the effect of magnetic accretion,
and for the angular momentum evolution of the star, which can be compared with
the observations. Our model predicts that the magnetospheric interaction of
magnetic white dwarfs with their discs results in a significant spin down, and
we show that for magnetic white dwarfs with relatively strong fields (larger
than 10 MG) the observed rotation periods of the magnetic white dwarf
population can be reproduced. We also investigate whether turbulence can be
sustained during the late phases of the evolution of the system. When a
critical temperature below which turbulence is not sustained is introduced into
the model, the periods of the three fast rotating, strongly magnetic, massive
white dwarfs in the solar neighborhood are recovered.

state. As an example we consider the electron transport through the system with
electron-phonon interaction. The concept of embedding (buffer zones between the

sufficient accuracy are likely to become the direct mise en pratique of the
possible new quantum definition of the ampere. Furthermore, they are essential
for closing the quantum metrological triangle experiment which tests for
possible corrections to the quantum relations linking e and h, the electron
charge and the Planck constant, to voltage, resistance and current. We present
here single-island hybrid metal/semiconductor transistor pumps which combine
the simplicity and efficiency of Coulomb blockade in metals with the
unsurpassed performances of silicon switches. Robust and simple pumping at
650MHz and 0.5K is demonstrated. The pumped current obtained over a voltage
bias range of 1.4mV corresponds to a relative deviation of 5e-4 from the
calculated value, well within the 1.5e-3 uncertainty of the measurement setup.
Multi-charge pumping can be performed. The simple design fully integrated in an
industrial CMOS process makes it an ideal candidate for national measurement
institutes to realize and share a future quantum ampere.

fluid which is experiencing dissipation in the form of heat flow,
free-streaming radiation, and shearing viscosity, undergoing gravitational
collapse. We calculate the Einstein-Maxwell field equations and, using the
Darmois junction conditions, match the interior non-static cylindrically
symmetric space-time with the exterior anisotropic, charged, cylindrically
symmetric space-time. The behavior of the density, pressure and luminosity of
the collapsing matter has been analyzed. From the dynamical equations, the
effect of charge and dissipative quantities over the cylindrical collapse are
studied. Finally, we have derived the solutions for the collapsing matter which
is valid during the later stages of collapse and have discussed the
significance from a physical standpoint.

instead of h citations as the threshold for the definition of the index, thus
changing the size of the core of the most influential publications of a
dataset. I analyze the citation records of 26 physicists in order to determine
how much the prefactor q influences the ranking. Likewise, the arbitrariness of
the highly-cited-publications indicator is due to the threshold value, given
either as an absolute number of citations or as a percentage of highly cited
papers. The analysis of the 26 citation records shows that the changes in the
rankings in dependence on these thresholds are rather large and comparable with
the respective changes for the h-index.

problems. Correspondingly, a number of algorithms have been developed that
exploit Toeplitz structure to gain computational efficiency when solving these

operations, while more recent ""superfast"" algorithms reduce the cost to O(n
(log n)^2) or below. In this work, we present a superfast algorithm for
Tikhonov regularization of Toeplitz systems. Using an
""extension-and-transformation"" technique, our algorithm translates a
Tikhonov-regularized Toeplitz system into a type of specialized polynomial
problem known as tangential interpolation. Under this formulation, we can
compute the solution in only O(n (log n)^2) operations. We use numerical
simulations to demonstrate our algorithm's complexity and verify that it
returns stable solutions.

automata with local tests between brothers of Bogaert and Tison (1992) and with
global equality and disequality constraints (TAGED) of Filiot et al. (2007).
TABG can test for equality and disequality modulo a given flat equational
theory between brother subterms and between subterms whose positions are
defined by the states reached during a computation. In particular, TABG can
check that all the subterms reaching a given state are distinct. This
constraint is related to monadic key constraints for XML documents, meaning
that every two distinct positions of a given type have different values. We
prove decidability of the emptiness problem for TABG. This solves, in
particular, the open question of the decidability of emptiness for TAGED. We
further extend our result by allowing global arithmetic constraints for
counting the number of occurrences of some state or the number of different
equivalence classes of subterms (modulo a given flat equational theory)
reaching some state during a computation. We also adapt the model to unranked
ordered terms. As a consequence of our results for TABG, we prove the
decidability of a fragment of the monadic second order logic on trees extended
with predicates for equality and disequality between subtrees, and cardinality.

set A with a structure of set of preferences by ""replacing"" the elements of I
with their inverse images via p considered as ""balloons"" (sets endowed with an
equivalence relation), lifting the linear order on A, and ""agglutinating"" this
structure with the balloons. Every ballooning A of a structure of linearly
ordered set I is a set of preferences whose preference relation (not
necessarily complete) is negatively transitive and every such structure on a
given set A can be obtained by ballooning of certain structure of a linearly
ordered set I, intrinsically encoded in A. In other words, the difference
between linearity and negative transitivity is constituted of balloons. As a
consequence of this characterization, under certain natural topological
conditions on the set of preferences A furnished with its interval topology,
the existence of a continuous generalized utility function on A is proved.

the same significant computational challenge of estimating probability density
in very high dimensional spaces with limited samples. We have developed a fast

these types of saliency maps possible. By aligning pixels from the center and
surround regions and treating their location coordinates as random variables,
we use a k-d partitioning method to efficiently estimating the center surround

eye tracking still image databases and show that the new technique is
competitive with state of the art bottom-up saliency computational methods. We
have also extended the technique to compute spatiotemporal visual saliency of

reflect a mismatch between magnetic energy density and energy density of the

the fractionalization of the quantum numbers of the global symmetry on some

different SPT states. For example, 2+1D bosonic SPT states with $Z_n$ symmetry
are classified by a $Z_n$ integer $m \in {\cal H}^3(Z_n, R/Z)=Z_n$. We find

spectrum radio quasar, PKS 1510-089, based on 3.75 years of observations with
the Large Area Telescope (LAT) detector on-board the Fermi gamma-ray Space
Telescope. Throughout the observing period, the 0.1 GeV < E < 300 GeV gamma-ray
flux was highly variable, undergoing several flaring events where the daily
flux exceeded 10^{-5} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} on 3 separate occasions. The
increased photon statistics of these large flares allowed the observations to
be re-analysed in 6 and 3 hour intervals, revealing flux doubling timescales as
small as 1.3\pm0.12 hours during the flare rise time, and flux halving
timescales of 1.21\pm0.15 hours during the flare decay. These are the smallest
variability timescales measured to date at MeV-GeV energies for the Flat
Spectrum Radio Quasar class of Active Galactic Nuclei.
  The >10^{-5} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} flare events were also studied in more
detail in an attempt to uncover evidence for the location of PKS 1510-089's
gamma-ray emission region. In particular, two approaches were used: (i)
searching for an energy dependence to the cooling timescales, and (ii)
searching for evidence of a spectral cut-off. Furthermore, an analysis of the
highest photon events within the 3.75 year data set finds PKS 1510-089 to be a
source of >20 GeV gamma-rays at the 13.5\sigma confidence level; a
observational property which is difficult to explain in the traditional view
that gamma-ray emission from Active Galactic Nuclei originates from the base of
the relativistic jet.
  The combined results of these two approaches, along with the confirmation of
>20 GeV photon flux from PKS 1510-089, suggest the presence of multiple
gamma-ray emission regions being located in both the broad line region and
molecular torus region of PKS 1510-089.

the coronal field lines. The linear and nonlinear dynamics are investigated in
the reduced magnetohydrodynamic regime in Cartesian geometry. Initially the
magnetic field lines get twisted and the system becomes unstable to the
internal kink mode, confirming and extending previous results. As typical in
this kind of investigations, where initial conditions implement smooth fields
and flux-tubes, we have neglected fluctuations and the fields are laminar until
the instability sets in. But previous investigations indicate that
fluctuations, excited by photospheric motions and coronal dynamics, are
naturally present at all scales in the coronal fields. Thus, in order to
understand the effect of a photospheric vortex on a more realistic corona, we
continue the simulations after kink instability sets in, when turbulent
fluctuations have already developed in the corona. In the nonlinear stage the
system never returns to the simple initial state with ordered twisted field
lines, and kink instability does not occur again. Nevertheless field lines get
twisted, but in a disordered way, and energy accumulates at large scales
through an inverse cascade. This energy can subsequently be released in
micro-flares or larger flares, when interaction with neighboring structures
occurs or via other mechanisms. The impact on coronal dynamics and CMEs

cooperation since it enables non-cooperative individuals to invade cooperative
clusters. Thus, in most biological scenarios, where the mobility of competing
individuals is an irrefutable fact, the spatial prisoner's dilemma alone cannot
explain stable cooperation but additional mechanisms are necessary for spatial
structure to promote the evolution of cooperation. The breakdown of cooperation
is analyzed in detail. We confirm the existence of a phase transition, here
controlled by mobility and costs, which distinguishes between purely
cooperative and non-cooperative absorbing states. While in one dimension the
model is in the class of the Voter Model, it belongs to the Directed
Percolation (DP) universality class in two dimensions.

interacting resonant levels connected by a Fermi sea, by means of
time-dependent density matrix renormalization group. We first consider
methodological issues, like the protocol that leads to a current-currying state
and the characterization of the steady state. At finite sizes both the current
and the occupations of the interacting levels oscillate as a function of time.
We determine the amplitude and period of such oscillations as a function of
bias. We find that the occupations on the two dots oscillate with a relative
phase which depends on the distance between the impurities and on the Fermi
momentum of the Fermi sea, as expected for RKKY interactions. Also the
approximant to the steady-state current displays oscillations as a function of
the distance between the impurities. Such a behavior can be explained by
resonances in the free case. We then discuss the incidence of interaction on
such a behavior. We conclude by showing the effect of the bias on the current,
making connection with the one-impurity case.

In the second approach, we perform our calculations numerically by considering
only the effects caused by the first few KK modes, present in the 4-dimensional
effective theory. In the case of a Higgs leaking far from the brane, both
approaches give the same predictions as the effects of the heavier KK modes
decouple. However, as the Higgs boson is pushed towards the TeV brane, the two
approaches seem to be equivalent only when one includes heavier and heavier
degrees of freedom (which do not seem to decouple). To reconcile these results
it is necessary to introduce a type of higher derivative operator which
essentially encodes the effects of integrating out the heavy KK modes and
dresses the brane Higgs so that it looks just like a bulk Higgs.

explicit and optimal LRCs that are simple to construct. Our construction is
based on grouping Reed-Solomon (RS) coded symbols to obtain RS coded symbols

selectively reversing the translated code. We illustrate the approach by
showing that coupling it with minimal extensions to a generic Prolog debugger

address two questions: (i) What is the role of the particles' aspect ratio in
the context of cluster formation, and does the particle shape affect the
system's behavior on hydrodynamic scales? (ii) To what extent does particle
conservation influence pattern formation? To answer these questions we suggest
a simple kinetic model permitting to depict some of the interaction properties
between freely moving particles and particles integrated in clusters. To this
end, we introduce two particle species: single and cluster particles.
Specifically, we account for coalescence of clusters from single particles,
assembly of single particles on existing clusters, collisions between clusters,
and cluster disassembly. Coarse-graining our kinetic model, (i) we demonstrate
that particle shape (i.e. aspect ratio) shifts the scale of the transition
density, but does not impact the instabilities at the ordering threshold. (ii)
We show that the validity of particle conservation determines the existence of
a longitudinal instability, which tends to amplify density heterogeneities
locally, and in turn triggers a wave pattern with wave vectors parallel to the
axis of macroscopic order. If the system is in contact with a particle
reservoir this instability vanishes due to a compensation of density
heterogeneities.

Domains, included with the Ciao Prolog system. The library is entirely written
in Prolog, leveraging on Ciao's module system and code transformation
capabilities in order to achieve a highly modular design without compromising
performance. We describe the interface, implementation, and design rationale of
each modular component.
  The library meets several design goals: a high level of modularity, allowing
the individual components to be replaced by different versions;
high-efficiency, being competitive with other FD implementations; a glass-box
approach, so the user can specify new constraints at different levels; and a
Prolog implementation, in order to ease the integration with Ciao's code
analysis components.
  The core is built upon two small libraries which implement integer ranges and
closures. On top of that, a finite domain variable datatype is defined, taking
care of constraint reexecution depending on range changes. These three
libraries form what we call the FD kernel of the library.
  This FD kernel is used in turn to implement several higher-level finite
domain constraints, specified using indexicals. Together with a labeling module
this layer forms what we name \emph{the FD solver}. A final level integrates
the clp(FD) paradigm with our FD solver. This is achieved using attributed
variables and a compiler from the clp(FD) language to the set of constraints
provided by the solver.
  It should be noted that the user of the library is encouraged to work in any
of those levels as seen convenient: from writing a new range module to
enriching the set of FD constraints by writing new indexicals.

surrounded by broad-line regions (BLRs). The broad emission lines seen in the
AGN spectra are emitted in this spatially unresolved region. We intend to
obtain information on the structure and geometry of this BLR based on observed
line profiles. We modeled the rotational and turbulent velocities in the
line-emitting region on the basis of the line-width FWHM and line dispersion
sigma_line of the variable broad emission lines in NGC5548. Based on these
velocities we estimated the height of the line-emitting regions above the
midplane in the context of their distances from the center. The broad emission
lines originate at distances of 2 to 27 light days from the center. Higher
ionized lines originate in the inner region (lesser equal 13 light days) in
specific filamentary structures 1 to 14 light days above the midplane. In
contrast, the Hbeta line is emitted in an outer (6 - 26 light days), more
flattened configuration at heights of 0.7 to 4 light days only above the
midplane. The derived geometry of the line-emitting region in NGC5548 is
consistent with an outflowing wind launched from an accretion disk.

galaxies has been known to be lower than theoretical expectations for 20 years.
In addition, both X-ray luminosity and metal abundance vary significantly among
galaxies of similar optical luminosities. This suggests some missing factors in
the galaxy evolution process, especially the metal enrichment process. With
{\it Chandra} and {\it XMM-Newton}, we studied 32 early-type galaxies (kT
$\lesssim$ 1 keV) covering a span of two orders of $L_{X,\rm gas}/L_{K}$ to
investigate these missing factors. Contrary to previous studies that X-ray
faint galaxies show extremely low Fe abundance ($\sim 0.1$ Z${_\odot}$), nearly
all galaxies in our sample show an Fe abundance at least 0.3 Z${_\odot}$,
although the measured Fe abundance difference between X-ray faint and X-ray
bright galaxies remains remarkable. We investigated whether this dichotomy of
hot gas Fe abundances can be related to the dilution of hot gas by mixing with
cold gas. With a subset of 24 galaxies in this sample, we find that there is
virtually no correlation between hot gas Fe abundances and their atomic gas
content, which disproves the scenario that the low metal abundance of X-ray
faint galaxies might be a result of the dilution of the remaining hot gas by
pristine atomic gas. In contrast, we demonstrate a negative correlation between
the measured hot gas Fe abundance and the ratio of molecular gas mass to hot
gas mass, although it is unclear what is responsible for this apparent
anti-correlation. We discuss several possibilities including that externally
originated molecular gas might be able to dilute the hot gas metal content.

Cartan structure equation as soon as the Lorentz gauge connections are
identified with the contortion tensor, an interaction term between the Lorentz
gauge fields and the spin connections has to be postulated. The full picture
involving gravity, torsion and spinors is described by a coupled set of field

electron transport. In MoS2, the longitudinal acoustic phonons show the

convexity-constrained nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator of the ROC
curve given by Lloyd (2002). Like Lloyd we use the Pool Adjacent Violator
Algorithm (PAVA) to construct the estimate of the convex curve. We present a
direct proof that this estimate is a convex hull of the empirical ROC curve.
The estimate is simple to construct by hand, and follows the suggestions by
Pesce, et~al.~(2010).
  We examine the properties of this constrained nonparametric maximum
likelihood estimator (NPMLE) under a large number of experimental conditions.
In particular we examine the behavior of the area under the curve which is
often used as summary metric of diagnostic performance. This constrained ROC
estimator gives an area under the curve (AUC) estimate that is biased high with
respect to the usual empirical AUC estimate, but may be less biased with
respect to the underlying continuous true AUC value. The constrained ROC
estimator has lower variance than the usual empirical one. Unlike previous
authors who used complex bootstrapping to estimate the variance of the
constrained NPMLE we demonstrate that standard unbiased estimators of variance
work well to estimate the variance of the NPMLE AUC.

represented by directed dissimilarities. The goal is to study methods for the
determination of hierarchical clusters, i.e., a family of nested partitions
indexed by a connectivity parameter, induced by the given dissimilarity
structures. Our construction of hierarchical clustering methods is based on
defining admissible methods to be those methods that abide by the axioms of
value - nodes in a network with two nodes are clustered together at the maximum
of the two dissimilarities between them - and transformation - when
dissimilarities are reduced, the network may become more clustered but not
less. Several admissible methods are constructed and two particular methods,
termed reciprocal and nonreciprocal clustering, are shown to provide upper and
lower bounds in the space of admissible methods. Alternative clustering
methodologies and axioms are further considered. Allowing the outcome of
hierarchical clustering to be asymmetric, so that it matches the asymmetry of
the original data, leads to the inception of quasi-clustering methods. The
existence of a unique quasi-clustering method is shown. Allowing clustering in
a two-node network to proceed at the minimum of the two dissimilarities
generates an alternative axiomatic construction. There is a unique clustering
method in this case too. The paper also develops algorithms for the computation
of hierarchical clusters using matrix powers on a min-max dioid algebra and
studies the stability of the methods proposed. We proved that most of the
methods introduced in this paper are such that similar networks yield similar
hierarchical clustering results. Algorithms are exemplified through their
application to networks describing internal migration within states of the
United States (U.S.) and the interrelation between sectors of the U.S. economy.

higher genus compact Riemann surfaces was initiated by Krichever and Novikov.
The elements of these algebras are meromorphic objects which are holomorphic
outside a finite set of points. A crucial and non-trivial point is to establish
an almost-grading replacing the honest grading in the Virasoro case. Such an
almost-grading is given by splitting the set of points of possible poles into
two non-empty disjoint subsets. Krichever and Novikov considered the two-point
case. Schlichenmaier studied the most general multi-point situation with
arbitrary splittings. Here we will review the path of developments from the
Virasoro algebra to its higher genus and multi-point analogs. The starting
point will be a Poisson algebra structure on the space of meromorphic forms of
all weights. As sub-structures the vector field algebras, function algebras,
Lie superalgebras and the related current algebras show up. All these algebras
will be almost-graded. In detail almost-graded central extensions are
classified. In particular, for the vector field algebra it is essentially
unique. The defining cocycle are given in geometric terms. Some applications,
including the semi-infinite wedge form representations are recalled. Finally,
some remarks on the by Krichever and Sheinman recently introduced Lax operator
algebras are made.

modern automotive structural parts because of its outstanding maximal
elongation and tensile strength. Nonetheless there is still a lack of corrosion
protection for this material due to the fact that cost efficient hot dip
galvanizing can not be applied. The reason for the insufficient coatability
with zinc is found in the segregation of manganese to the surface during
annealing and the formation of manganese oxides prior coating. This work
analyses the structure and chemical composition of the surface oxides on so
called nano-TWIP (twinning induced plasticity) steel on the nanoscopic scale
after hot dip galvanizing in a simulator with employed analytical methods
comprising scanning Auger electron spectroscopy (SAES), energy dispersive x-ray
spectroscopy (EDX), and focused ion beam (FIB) for cross section preparation.
By the combination of these methods it was possible to obtain detailed chemical

the benefits of exploiting symmetry in order to reduce storage and computation
is in conflict with a desire to simplify memory access patterns. In this paper,
we propose a blocked data structure (Blocked Compact Symmetric Storage) wherein
we consider the tensor by blocks and store only the unique blocks of a
symmetric tensor. We propose an algorithm-by-blocks, already shown of benefit
for matrix computations, that exploits this storage format by utilizing a
series of temporary tensors to avoid redundant computation. Further, partial
symmetry within temporaries is exploited to further avoid redundant storage and
redundant computation. A detailed analysis shows that, relative to storing and
computing with tensors without taking advantage of symmetry and partial
symmetry, storage requirements are reduced by a factor of $ O\left( m! \right)$
and computational requirements by a factor of $O\left( (m+1)!/2^m \right)$,
where $ m $ is the order of the tensor. However, as the analysis shows, care
must be taken in choosing the correct block size to ensure these storage and
computational benefits are achieved (particularly for low-order tensors). An
implementation demonstrates that storage is greatly reduced and the complexity
introduced by storing and computing with tensors by blocks is manageable.
Preliminary results demonstrate that computational time is also reduced. The
paper concludes with a discussion of how insights in this paper point to
opportunities for generalizing recent advances in the domain of linear algebra
libraries to the field of multi-linear computation.

pairs of stochastic quantities. MIC is based on mutual information, a
fundamental quantity in information theory that is widely understood to serve
this need. MIC, however, is not an estimate of mutual information. Indeed, it
was claimed that MIC possesses a desirable mathematical property called
""equitability"" that mutual information lacks. This was not proven; instead it
was argued solely through the analysis of simulated data. Here we show that
this claim, in fact, is incorrect. First we offer mathematical proof that no
(non-trivial) dependence measure satisfies the definition of equitability
proposed by Reshef et al.. We then propose a self-consistent and more general
definition of equitability that follows naturally from the Data Processing
Inequality. Mutual information satisfies this new definition of equitability
while MIC does not. Finally, we show that the simulation evidence offered by
Reshef et al. was artifactual. We conclude that estimating mutual information
is not only practical for many real-world applications, but also provides a
natural solution to the problem of quantifying associations in large data sets.

it was observed in several but not all seasons. A long-term monitoring of the

lines as a proxy for chromospheric activity, and we studied the X-ray emission
in search of flux modulations and to determine basic properties of the coronal
plasma. A detailed analysis of the flux in the cores of the CaII H&K lines and
a similar study of the X-ray photometry shows evidence of source variability,
including one flare. The analysis of the the time series of chromospheric data
indicates a modulation with a ~11 days period, compatible with the stellar
rotation period at high latitudes. Instead, the X-ray light curve suggests a
signal with a period of ~4 days, consistent with the presence of two active
regions on opposite hemispheres. The observed variability can be explained,
most likely, as due to rotational modulation and to intrinsic evolution of
chromospheric and coronal activity. There is no clear signature related to the
orbital motion of the planet, but the possibility that just a fraction of the
chromospheric and coronal variability is modulated with the orbital period of
the planet, or the stellar-planet beat period, cannot be excluded. We conclude
that any effect due to the presence of the planet is difficult to disentangle.

roughly Earth-mass microhalos in order to determine their inner density
profile. We find that CDM microhalos in simulations without a cutoff in the
power spectrum roughly follow the NFW density profile, just like the much
larger CDM halos on galaxy and galaxy cluster scales. But having a cutoff in
the initial power spectrum at a typical neutralino free streaming scale of
$10^{-7} M_{\odot}$ makes their inner density profiles considerably steeper,
i.e. $\rho \propto r^{-(1.3-1.4)}$, in good agreement with the results from
Ishiyama et al. (2010). An extrapolation of the halo and subhalo mass functions
down to the cutoff scale indicates that microhalos are extremely abundant
throughout the present day dark matter distribution and might contribute
significantly to indirect dark matter detection signals. Assuming a transition
from a NFW to a steeper inner profile ($\rho \propto r^{-1.4}$) two orders of
magnitude above the cutoff scale, the total boost factor for a Milky Way sized
dark matter halo increases from about 3.5 to 4. We further find that CDM
microhalo concentrations are consistent with the Bullock et al. (2001) model
and clearly rule out simplistic power law models for the mass dependence of
concentrations and subhalo annihilation, which would erroneously lead to very
large boost factors (a few hundred for galaxy halos and over 1000 for

simultaneously solving for the surface spectra and their geographical

known viewing geometry. We use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo to determine best-fit

  Aims. We are aiming to characterise the young stellar and protostellar
population in and around Gum 31 and to investigate the star-formation process
in this region.
  Methods. We identify candidate young stellar objects from Spitzer, WISE, and
Herschel data. Combining these, we analyse the spectral energy distributions of
the candidate young stellar objects. With density and temperature maps obtained
from Herschel data and comparisons to a 'collect and collapse' scenario for the
region we are able to further constrain the characteristics of the region as a
whole.
  Results. 661 candidate young stellar objects are found from WISE data, 91
protostar candidates are detected through Herschel observations in a 1.0 deg x
1.1 deg area. Most of these objects are found in small clusters or are well
aligned with the H II bubble. We also identify the sources of Herbig-Haro jets.
The infrared morphology of the region suggests that it is part of the larger
Carina Nebula complex.
  Conclusions. The location of the candidate young stellar objects in the rim
of the H II bubble is suggestive of their being triggered by a 'collect and
collapse' scenario, which agrees well with the observed parameters of the
region. Some candidate young stellar objects are found in the heads of pillars,
which points towards radiative triggering of star formation. Thus, we find
evidence that in the region different mechanisms of triggered star formation
are at work. Correcting the number of candidate young stellar objects for
contamination we find ~ 600 young stellar objects in Gum 31 above our
completeness limit of about 1 M_sol. Extrapolating the intital mass function
down to 0.1 M_sol, we estimate a total population of ~ 5000 young stars for the

tidal stirring model posits that late-type, rotationally-supported dwarfs
resembling present-day dwarf irregular (dIrr) galaxies can transform into dSphs
via interactions with Milky Way-sized hosts. Using collisionless N-body
simulations, we investigate for the first time how tidal stirring depends on
the dark matter (DM) density distribution in the central stellar region of the
progenitor disky dwarf. Specifically, we explore various asymptotic inner
slopes gamma of the dwarf DM density profiles (rho \propto r^{-gamma} as r ->
0). For a given orbit inside the primary, rotationally-supported dwarfs
embedded in DM halos with core-like density distributions (gamma = 0.2) and
mild density cusps (gamma = 0.6) demonstrate a substantially enhanced
likelihood and efficiency of transformation into dSphs compared to their
counterparts with steeper DM density profiles (gamma = 1). Such shallow DM
distributions are akin to those of observed dIrrs, highlighting tidal stirring
as a plausible model for the LG morphology-density relation. When gamma <1, a
single pericentric passage can induce dSph formation and disky dwarfs on
low-eccentricity or large-pericenter orbits are able to transform into dSphs;
these new results allow the tidal stirring model to explain the existence of
virtually all known dSphs across a wide range of distances from their hosts. A
subset of rotationally-supported dwarfs with gamma <1 are eventually disrupted
by the primary; those that survive as dSphs are generally on orbits that are
biased towards lower eccentricities and/or larger pericenters relative to those
of typical CDM satellites. The latter could explain the rather peculiar orbits
of several classic LG dSphs such as Fornax, Leo I, Tucana, and Cetus.

peaked at z_P1=21.7 mag, making PS1-10afx comparable to the most luminous known
SNe, with M_u = -22.3 mag. Our extensive optical and NIR observations indicate
that the bolometric light curve of PS1-10afx rose on the unusually fast
timescale of ~12 d to the extraordinary peak luminosity of 4.1e44 erg/s (M_bol
= -22.8 mag) and subsequently faded rapidly. Equally important, the SED is
unusually red for a SLSN, with a color temperature of 6800 K near maximum
light, in contrast to previous H-poor SLSNe, which are bright in the UV. The
spectra more closely resemble those of a normal SN Ic than any known SLSN, with
a photospheric velocity of 11,000 km/s and evidence for line blanketing in the
rest-frame UV. Despite the fast rise, these parameters imply a very large
emitting radius (>5e15 cm). We demonstrate that no existing theoretical model
can satisfactorily explain this combination of properties: (i) a nickel-powered
light curve cannot match the combination of high peak luminosity with the fast
timescale; (ii) models powered by the spindown energy of a rapidly-rotating
magnetar predict significantly hotter and faster ejecta; and (iii) models
invoking shock breakout through a dense circumstellar medium cannot explain the
observed spectra or color evolution. The host galaxy is well detected in
pre-explosion imaging with a luminosity near L*, a star formation rate of 15

relativistic, the flux is greatly amplified in the direction of motion, making
blazars the most powerful persistent objects in the Universe. This is true at
all frequencies, but especially where their spectrum peaks. Although the
spectrum of moderate powerful sources peaks in the ~GeV range, extremely
powerful sources at high redshifts peak in the ~MeV band. This implies that the
hard X-ray band is the optimal one to find powerful blazars beyond a redshift
of ~4. First indications strongly suggest that powerful high-z blazars harbor
the most massive and active early black holes, exceeding a billion solar
masses. Since for each detected blazars there must exist hundreds of similar,
but misaligned, sources, the search for high-z blazars is becoming competitive
with the search of early massive black holes using radio-quiet quasars. Finding
how the two populations of black holes (one in jetted sources, the other in
radio-quiet objects) evolve in redshift will shed light on the growth of the
most massive black holes and possibly on the feedback between the central
engine and the rest of the host galaxy.

extended by terms that describe crystal-field splittings and orbital-lattice

potential terms that act both on doped holes and on electrons within occupied

breaking caused by the onset of magnetic and orbital order is taken into

presence of defect states and strong correlations. These features reflect the
action on electrons/holes of the generalized defect potential that affects
charge and orbital degrees of freedom, and indirectly also spin ones. The
present study elucidates the mechanism behind the Coulomb gap appearing in the

thermal spectra from quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries (qLMXBs) inside globular
clusters (GCs). Recent observations of NSs have presented evidence that cold
ultra dense matter -- present in the core of NSs -- is best described by
""normal matter"" equations of state (EoSs). Such EoSs predict that the radii of
NSs, Rns, are quasi-constant (within measurement errors, of ~10%) for
astrophysically relevant masses (Mns > 0.5 Msun). The present work adopts this
theoretical prediction as an assumption, and uses it to constrain a single Rns
value from five qLMXB targets with available high signal-to-noise X-ray
spectroscopic data. Employing a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo approach, we produce
the marginalized posterior distribution for Rns, constrained to be the same
value for all five NSs in the sample. An effort was made to include all
quantifiable sources of uncertainty into the uncertainty of the quoted radius
measurement. These include the uncertainties in the distances to the GCs, the
uncertainties due to the Galactic absorption in the direction of the GCs, and
the possibility of a hard power-law spectral component for count excesses at
high photon energy, which are observed in some qLMXBs in the Galactic plane.
Using conservative assumptions,we found that the radius, common to the five
qLMXBs and constant for a wide range of masses, lies in the low range of
possible NS radii, Rns=9.1(+1.3)(-1.5) km (90%-confidence). Such a value is
consistent with low-res equations of state. We compare this result with
previous radius measurements of NSs from various analyses of different types of
systems. In addition, we compare the spectral analyses of individual qLMXBs to
previous works.

the mass of the graviton, which in turn can be kept small in a technically
natural way. Thus PM gravity could offer a compelling solution to the old

dynamics is obtained by computing the so-called isochrons, i.e. the sets of
points that converge toward the same trajectory on the limit cycle. Motivated
by the analysis of excitable systems, a similar reduction has been attempted
for non-periodic systems admitting a stable fixed point. In this case, the
isochrons can still be defined but they do not capture the asymptotic behavior
of the trajectories. Instead, the sets of interest-that we call isostables-are
defined in literature as the sets of points that converge toward the same
trajectory on the stable slow manifold of the fixed point. However, it turns
out that this definition of the isostables holds only for systems with
slow-fast dynamics. Also, efficient methods for computing the isostables are
missing.
  The present paper provides a general framework for the definition and the
computation of the isostables of stable fixed points, which is based on the
spectral properties of the so-called Koopman operator. More precisely, the
isostables are defined as the level sets of a particular eigenfunction of the
Koopman operator. Through this approach, the isostables are unique and
well-defined objects related to the asymptotic properties of the system. Also,
the framework reveals that the isostables and the isochrons are two different
but complementary notions which define a set of action-angle coordinates for
the dynamics. In addition, an efficient algorithm for computing the isostables
is obtained, which relies on the evaluation of Laplace averages along the
trajectories. The method is illustrated with the excitable FitzHugh-Nagumo
model and with the Lorenz model. Finally, we discuss how these methods based on
the Koopman operator framework relate to the global linearization of the system
and to the derivation of special Lyapunov functions.

of these phases (through a number of ab initio path-integral molecular dynamics
(PIMD) simulations at particular points on the phase diagram). We also examine
the importance of van der Waals forces in this system by performing
calculations using the optB88-vdW density functional, which accounts for
non-local correlations. Our calculations reveal that the transition between
phases I and II is strongly quantum in nature, resulting from a competition
between anisotropic inter-molecular interactions that restrict molecular
rotation and thermal plus quantum fluctuations of the nuclear positions that
facilitate it. The transition from phase II to III is more classical because
quantum nuclear motion plays only a secondary role and the transition is
determined primarily by the underlying potential energy surface. A structure of
P21c symmetry with 24 atoms in the primitive unit cell is found to be stable
when anharmonic quantum nuclear vibrational motion is included at finite
temperatures using the PIMD method. This structure gives a good account of the
infra-red (IR) and Raman vibron frequencies of phase II. We find ad-ditional
support for C2/c structure as a strong candidate for phase III, since it
remains transparent up to 300 GPa, even when quantum nuclear effects are
included. Finally, we find that accounting for van der Waals forces improves
the agreement between experiment and theory for the parts of the phase diagram

a bimatrix game (2-NASH) can be formulated as a linear complementarity problem
(LCP). In addition, 2-NASH is known to be complete in the complexity class PPAD
(Polynomial-time Parity Argument Directed). However, the ingeniously
constructed reduction (which is designed for any PPAD problem) is very
complicated, so while of great theoretical significance, it is not practical
for actually solving an LCP via 2-NASH, and it may not provide the potential
insight that can be gained from studying the game obtained from a problem
formulated as an LCP (e.g. market equilibrium). The main goal of this paper is
the construction of a simple explicit reduction of any LCP(q,M) that can be
verified as belonging to PPAD via the graph induced by the generic Lemke
algorithm with some positive covering vector d, to a symmetric 2-NASH. In
particular, any endpoint of this graph (with the exception of the initial point
of the algorithm) corresponds to either a solution or to a so-called secondary
ray. Thus, an LCP problem is verified as belonging to PPAD if any secondary ray
can be used to construct, in polynomial time, a certificate that there is no
solution to the problem. We achieve our goal by showing that for any M,q and a
positive d satisfying a certain nondegeneracy assumption with respect to M, we
can simply and directly construct a symmetric 2-NASH whose Nash equilibria
correspond one-to-one to the end points of the graph induced by LCP(q,M) and
the Lemke algorithm with a covering vector d. We note that for a given M the

a payoff based on her strategy, the strategy of her neighbors and a payoff
matrix. Following the traditional approach of evolutionary game theory, this
payoff is interpreted as a fitness: the dynamics of the system is derived by
thinking of positive payoffs as birth rates and the absolute value of negative
payoffs as death rates. The nonspatial mean-field approximation obtained under
the assumption that the population is well mixing is the popular replicator
equation. The main objective is to understand the consequences of the inclusion

matrices. Our results indicate that the inclusion of local interactions induces
a reduction of the coexistence region of the replicator equation and the
presence of a dominant strategy that wins even when starting at arbitrarily low
density in the region where the replicator equation displays bistability. We
also discuss the implications of these results in the parameter regions that
correspond to the most popular games: the prisoner's dilemma, the stag hunt

and can be effectively characterized through X-ray absorption line
spectroscopy. However, in a study of the hot medium using the accreting neutron
star X-ray binary, Cyg X-2, as a background light source, a mystery came about
when the putatively strong OVII Kalpha line was not detected in Chandra grating
observations, while other normally weaker lines such as OVII Kbeta as well as
OVI and OVIII Kalpha are clearly present (Yao et al. 2009). We have
investigated the grating spectra of Cyg X-2 from 10 XMM-Newton observations, in
search of the missing line. We detect it consistently in nine of these
observations, but the line is absent in the remaining one observation or is
inconsistent with the detection in others at a 4sigma confidence level. This
absence of the line resembles that seen in the Chandra observations. Similarly,
the OVI Kalpha line is found to disappear occasionally, but not in concert with
the variation of the OVII Kalpha line. All these variations are most likely due
to the presence of changing OVII and OVI Kalpha emission lines of Cyg X-2,
which are blurred together with the absorption ones in the X-ray spectra. A
re-examination of the Chandra grating data indeed shows evidence for a narrow
emission line slightly off the OVI Kalpha absorption line. We further show that
narrow NV emission lines with varying centroids and fluxes are present in
far-UV spectra from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph aboard the Hubble Space
Telescope. These results provide new constraints on the accretion around the
neutron star and on the X-ray-heating of the stellar companion. The
understanding of these physical processes is also important to the fidelity of
using such local X-ray binaries for interstellar absorption line spectroscopy.

that it is independent of the parameter $a$ for $a>3 - \eta_{sr}$ and is equal

yielding 10 new detections of the [O III]{\lambda}4363 auroral line. The oxygen
abundance gradient measured from these data, combined with previous
observations, displays a local scatter of 0.15+/-0.03 dex along an arc in the
west side of the galaxy, compared with a smaller scatter of 0.08+/-0.01 dex in
the rest of the disk. One of the H I I regions in our sample (H27) has a
significantly lower oxygen abundance than surrounding nebulae at a similar
galactocentric distance, while an additional, relatively nearby one (H128) was
already known to have a high oxygen abundance for its position in the galaxy.
These results represent marginal evidence for the existence of moderate
deviations from chemical abundance homogeneity in the interstellar medium of
M101. Using a variety of strong-line abundance indicators, we find no evidence
for significant large-scale azimuthal variations of the oxygen abundance across
the whole disk of the galaxy.

of the intracluster medium (ICM) in the Abell 1835 galaxy cluster (kT ~ 8 keV,
z = 0.253) out to the virial radius (r_vir ~ 2.9 Mpc) and beyond. Faint X-ray
emission from the ICM out to r_vir is detected. The temperature gradually
decreases with radius from ~8 keV in the inner region to ~2 keV at r_vir. The
entropy profile is shown to flatten beyond r_500, in disagreement with the
r_1.1 dependence predicted from the accretion shock heating model. The thermal
pressure profile in the range 0.3r_500 < r < r_vir agrees well with that
obtained from the stacked Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect observations with the
Planck satellite. The hydrostatic mass profile in the cluster outskirts (r_500
< r < r_vir) falls well short of the weak lensing one derived from
Subaru/Suprime-Cam observations, showing an unphysical decrease with radius.
The gas mass fraction at r_vir defined with the lensing total mass agrees with
the cosmic baryon fraction from the WMAP 7-year data. All these results
indicate, rather than the gas-clumping effect, that the bulk of the ICM in the
cluster outskirts is far from hydrostatic equilibrium and infalling matter
retained some of its kinetic energy. Finally, combining with our recent Suzaku
and lensing analysis of Abell 1689, a cluster of similar mass, temperature, and
redshift, we show that the cluster temperature distribution in the outskirts is
significantly correlated with the galaxy density field in the surrounding
large-scale environment at (1-2)r_vir.

studying the formation and evolution of galaxies, because all galaxies contain
many stars and they evolve with galaxies. Spectra data are usually used to
determine the stellar populations of nearby galaxies as they have the ability
to disentangle the degeneracy between stellar age and metallicity. However, it
is difficult to give similar studies to distant (e.g., $z >$ 0.3) galaxies
because of the lack of reliable spectra data. This is actually limited by
current observational equipments and methods. In fact, the information of the
stellar ages and metallicities of distant galaxies are crucial for solving the
problem of galaxy formation and evolution. Colours can give us some information
of the stellar populations of distant galaxies. In the paper, I introduce our
works about using colours to estimate the ages and metallicities of the stellar

parameters (age and metallicity) and their sensitivities to stellar-population

only one of 200,000 of the computing time. Although we can use the database to

dynamics over time in a multiple markets setting, where firms interact within

contract their shares, and compete to consolidate their position by acquiring
new ones in both the market where they operate and in new markets. The model
parameters can meaningfully account for phenomena such as barriers to entry and
exit, fixed and sunk costs, costs of expanding to new sectors with different
technologies and competitive advantage among firms. The construction is
obtained in a Bayesian framework by means of a collection of nonparametric
hierarchical mixtures, which induce the dependence between markets and provide
a generalization of the Blackwell-MacQueen P\'{o}lya urn scheme, which in turn
is used to generate a partially exchangeable dynamical particle system. A
Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm is provided for simulating trajectories of
the system, by means of which we perform a simulation study for transitions to
different economic regimes. Moreover, it is shown that the infinite-dimensional
properties of the system, when appropriately transformed and rescaled, are
those of a collection of interacting Fleming-Viot diffusions.

Math. Phys",,"10.1007/s11232-013-0074-5",,"nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Annihilation processes, where the reacting particles are influenced by some
external advective field, are one of the simplest examples of nonlinear
statistical systems. This type of processes can be observed in miscellaneous
chemical, biological or physical systems. In low space dimensions usual
description by means of kinetic rate equation is not sufficient and the effect
of density fluctuations must be taken into ac- count. Using perturbative
renormalization group we study the influ- ence of random velocity field on the
kinetics of single-species annihila- tion reaction at and below its critical
dimension $d_c = 2$. The advecting velocity field is modelled by the
self-similar in space Gaussian variable finite correlated in time
(Antonov-Kraichnan model). Effect of the compressibility of velocity field is
taken into account and the model is analyzed near its critical dimension by
means of three-parameter expansion in $\epsilon$, $\Delta$ and $\eta$. Here
$\epsilon$ is the deviation from the Kolmogorov scaling, $\Delta$ is the
deviation from the (critical) space dimension 2 and {\eta} is the deviation
from the parabolic dispersion law. Depending on the value of these exponents
and the value of compressiblity parameter {\alpha}, the studied model can
exhibit various asymptotic (long-time) regimes corresponding to the infrared
(IR) fixed points of the renormalization group. The possible regimes are
summarized and the decay rates for the mean particle number are calculated in
the leading order of the perturbation theory.

state and metallic surface state involving Dirac fermions that behave as
massless relativistic particles. These Dirac fermions are responsible for
achieving a number of novel and exotic quantum phenomena in the topological
insulators and for their potential applications in spintronics and quantum
computations. It is thus essential to understand the electron dynamics of the
Dirac fermions, i.e., how they interact with other electrons, phonons and
disorders. Here we report super-high resolution angle-resolved photoemission
studies on the Dirac fermion dynamics in the prototypical Bi2(Te,Se)3
topological insulators. We have directly revealed signatures of the
electron-phonon coupling in these topological insulators and found that the
electron-disorder interaction is the dominant factor in the scattering process.
The Dirac fermion dynamics in Bi2(Te3-xSex) topological insulators can be tuned
by varying the composition, x, or by controlling the charge carriers. Our
findings provide crucial information in understanding the electron dynamics of
the Dirac fermions in topological insulators and in engineering their surface

numerically observed with examples. In fact, numerical experiments show that
there exist minimization problems for which the existing algorithm generates

describe a probabilistic model for a time-series process of this nature, and
use this to perform inference of single- and multi-level arc processes from
data. We describe an efficient Viterbi-like process for MAP inference of arcs.
Our approach is score-agnostic, and together with efficient inference allows
for online analysis of performances including improvisations, and can predict
immediate future tempo trajectories.

the initial configurations of the models so that an accelerated expansion may

previous model that reproduces the polarised synchrotron is not compatible with
the WMAP 94 GHz polarised emission data. In particular, the high degree of dust
polarisation in the outer Galaxy (90deg < l < 270deg) implies that the fields
in the dust-emitting regions are more ordered than the average of
synchrotron-emitting regions. This new dust information allows us to constrain
the spatial mixing of the coherent and random magnetic field components in the
outer Galaxy. The inner Galaxy differs in polarisation degree and apparently
requires a more complicated scenario than our current model. In the scenario
that each interstellar component (including fields and now dust) follows a
spiral arm modulation, as observed in external galaxies, the changing degree of
ordering of the fields in dust-emitting regions may imply that the dust arms
and the field component arms are shifted as a varying function of
Galacto-centric radius. We discuss the implications for how the spiral arm
compression affects the various components of the magnetised interstellar
medium but conclude that improved data such as that expected from the Planck

requires monitoring large parts of the sky. This idea has gained some
instrumental support in recent years, such as with the ""Pi of the Sky"" project.
The broad sky coverage of the ""Pi of the Sky"" apparatus results from using
cameras with wide-angle lenses (20x20 deg field of view). Optics of this kind
introduce significant deformations of the point spread function (PSF),
increasing with the distance from the frame centre. A deformed PSF results in
additional uncertainties in data analysis. Our aim was to create a model
describing highly deformed PSF in optical astronomy, allowing uncertainties
caused by image deformations to be reduced. Detailed laboratory measurements of
PSF, pixel sensitivity, and pixel response functions were performed. These data
were used to create an effective high quality polynomial model of the PSF.
Finally, tuning the model and tests in applications to the real sky data were
performed.
  We have developed a PSF model that accurately describes even very deformed
stars in our wide-field experiment. The model is suitable for use in any other
experiment with similar image deformation, with a simple tuning of its
parameters. Applying this model to astrometric procedures results in a
significant improvement over standard methods, while basic photometry precision
performed with the model is comparable to the results of an optimised aperture
algorithm. Additionally, the model was used to search for a weak signal --
namely a possible gamma ray burst optical precursor -- showing very promising
results. Precise modelling of the PSF function significantly improves the
astrometric precision and enhances the discovery potential of a wide-field
system with lens optics.

saturation where both the carrier density and a particle-hole ""excitonic""

corresponding quantities in free field theory, while the conventional chiral
condensate is strongly suppressed. The corresponding ground state is speculated
to be a strongly-correlated degenerate fermion system, with a remnant Fermi

distribution (see for example, the invariance principle proved by Csorgo et al
(2003, Ann Probab) for self-normalised sums that converges to Brownian motion).
The proof uses recursive equations similar to those that arise in the area of
stochastic approximation and it shows (through examples) that one can simulate
any functionals of any segment of the OU process. The similar things can be
done for any diffusion process as well.

from H$_2$ into cooling rate around $T\sim (4-5)\times 10^3$ K stimulates
thermal instability in the metallicity range $Z\simlt 10^{-2} Z_\odot$.
Isobaric cooling rates are generally lower than isochoric ones, because the
associated increase of gas density leads to both more efficient hydrogen
recombination and equilibration of the fine-structure level populations.
Isochoric cooling keeps the ionization fraction remains quite high at
$T\simlt10^4$ K: up to $\sim0.01$ at $T\simeq 10^3$ K and $Z\simlt 0.1
Z_\odot$, and even higher at higher metallicity, contrary to isobaric cooling
where it at least an order of magnitude lower. Despite this increase in
ionization fraction the gas-phase formation rate of molecular hydrogen (via
H$^-$) lowers with metallicity, because higher metallicity shorttens the
evolution time. We implement our self-consistent cooling rates into the
multi-dimensional parallel code ZEUS-MP in order to simulate evolution of a
supernova remnant, and compare it with an analogous model with tabulated
cooling rates published in previous works. We find significant differences
between the two descriptions, which may appear, e.g., in mixing of the ejected

evolution of attitudes, beliefs and behaviour within social groups. Homophily
relates the similarity between pairs of individuals' attitudinal states to
their frequency of interaction, and hence structural tie strength, while social
influence causes the convergence of individuals' states during interaction.
Building on these basic elements, we propose a new mathematical modelling
framework to describe the evolution of attitudes within a group of interacting
agents. Specifically, our model describes sub-conscious attitudes that have an
activator-inhibitor relationship. We consider a homogeneous population using a
deterministic, continuous-time dynamical system. Surprisingly, the combined
effects of homophily and social influence do not necessarily lead to group
consensus or global monoculture. We observe that sub-group formation and
polarisation-like effects may be transient, the long-time dynamics being
quasi-periodic with sensitive dependence to initial conditions. This is due to
the interplay between the evolving interaction network and Turing instability
associated with the attitudinal state dynamics.

1990N, 2000cx and 2005hj (that all exhibit low velocity decline rates for the

that are highly polarized. The polarization of these features decreases as they
become weaker from -5 days. At +2 days, the polarization angles of the low

different velocities, the high and low velocity Ca components have orthogonal

spectroscopic binary and showed, as well, clear evidence of Gamma Dor type
pulsations. We obtained phase resolved high-resolution spectroscopy with the
Sandiford spectrograph at the McDonald 2.1m telescope and the FEROS
spectrograph at the ESO 2.2m telescope. Spectroscopy yielded both the radial

temperatures, metallicity and line-of-sight projected rotational velocities.
The CoRoT light curve was analyzed with an iterative procedure, devised to
disentangle eclipses from pulsations. We obtained an accurate determination of
the system parameters, and by comparison with evolutionary models strict
constraints on the system age. Finally, the residuals obtained after
subtraction of the best fitting eclipsing binary model were analyzed to
determine the pulsator properties. We achieved a quite complete and consistent
description of the system. The primary star pulsates with typical {\gamma} Dor
frequencies and shows a splitting in period which is consistent with high order
g-mode pulsations in a star of the corresponding physical parameters. The value
of the splitting, in particular, is consistent with pulsations in l = 1 modes.

measurement code for weak gravitational lensing shear. im3shape performs a
maximum likelihood fit of a bulge-plus-disc galaxy model to noisy images,
incorporating an applied point spread function. We detail challenges faced and
choices made in its design and implementation, and then discuss various
limitations that affect this and other maximum likelihood methods. We assess
the bias arising from fitting an incorrect galaxy model using simple noise-free
images and find that it should not be a concern for current cosmic shear
surveys.
  We test im3shape on the GREAT08 Challenge image simulations, and meet the
requirements for upcoming cosmic shear surveys in the case that the simulations
are encompassed by the fitted model, using a simple correction for image noise
bias. For the fiducial branch of GREAT08 we obtain a negligible additive shear
bias and sub-two percent level multiplicative bias, which is suitable for
analysis of current surveys. We fall short of the sub-percent level requirement
for upcoming surveys, which we attribute to a combination of noise bias and the
mis-match between our galaxy model and the model used in the GREAT08
simulations. We meet the requirements for current surveys across all branches
of GREAT08, except those with small or high noise galaxies, which we would cut
from our analysis. Using the GREAT08 metric we we obtain a score of Q=717 for
the usable branches, relative to the goal of Q=1000 for future experiments. The

transfer scale $\Gamma_{\rm eff}$ and the dynamically induced capacitive
coupling $U_{\rm eff}$ between the molecular level and the lead electrons which
turns out to be proportional to the polaronic energy shift $E_p$ for the

the phonon frequency $\w_0$ correspond to additional maxima in the differential
conductance. Non-equilibrium effects, however, lead to significant deviations
between a symmetric junction and a junction in the tunnel regime. The
suppression of the current for asymmetric junctions with increasing

profiles in VLBI images of astrophysical jets to profiles predicted by a
theoretical model. As an example, the method is used to fit profiles of the jet
in the Active Galactic Nucleus Mrk501 with profiles predicted by a model in
which a cylindrical jet of synchrotron plasma is threaded by a magnetic field
with helical and disordered components. This fitting yields model Stokes Q
profiles that agree with the observed profiles to within the 1-2 \sigma
uncertainties; the I model and observed profiles are overall not in such good
agreement, with the model I profiles being generally more symmetrical than the
observed profiles. Consistent fitting results are obtained for profiles derived
from 6cm VLBI images at two distances from the core, and also for profiles
obtained for different wavelengths at a single location in the VLBI jet. The
most striking success of the model is its ability to reproduce the spine-sheath
polarization structure observed across the jet. Using the derived viewing angle
in the jet rest frame, \delta' approximately 83 degrees, together with a
superluminal speed reported in the literature, \beta apparent = 3.3, yields a
solution for the viewing angle and velocity of the jet in the observer's frame
\delta degrees and \beta approximately 0.96. Although these results for Mrk501
must be considered tentative, the combined analysis of polarization profiles
and apparent component speeds holds promise as a means of further elucidating
the magnetic field structures and other parameters of parsec-scale AGN jets.

the most important SNRs for investigating the acceleration of multi-TeV
particles and the origin of Galactic cosmic rays because of its strong
synchrotron X-ray and TeV gamma-ray emission, which show a shell-like
morphology similar to each other. Using the XMM-Newton archival data consisting
of multiple pointing observations of the northwestern rim of the remnant, we
investigate the spatial properties of the nonthermal X-ray emission as a
function of distance from an outer shock wave. All X-ray spectra are well
reproduced by an absorbed power-law model above 2 keV. It is found that the
spectra show gradual softening from a photon index 2.56 in the rim region to
2.96 in the interior region. We show that this radial profile can be
interpreted as a gradual decrease of the cutoff energy of the electron spectrum
due to synchrotron cooling. By using a simple spectral evolution model that
includes continuous synchrotron losses, the spectral softening can be
reproduced with the magnetic field strength in the post-shock flow to less than
several tens of uG. If this is a typical magnetic field in the SNR shell,
gamma-ray emission would be accounted for by inverse Compton scattering of
high-energy electrons that also produce the synchrotron X-ray emission. Future
hard X-ray imaging observations with Nustar and ASTRO-H and TeV gamma-ray
observations with the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will allow to us to
explore other possible explanations of the systematic softening of the X-ray

show a dearth of outbursts compared to those observed in the field. A number of
explanations have been proposed, including low mass-transfer rates and/or
moderate magnetic fields implying higher mass white dwarfs than the average
observed in the field. Alternatively this apparent dearth may be simply a
selection bias. Aims. We examine multi-wavelength data of a new cataclysmic
variable, CV1, in the globular cluster M 22 to try to constrain its period and
magnetic nature, with an aim at understanding whether globular cluster
cataclysmic variables are intrinsically different from those observed in the
field. Methods. We use the sub-arcsecond resolution of the Chandra ACIS-S to
identify the X-ray counterpart to CV1 and analyse the X-ray spectrum to
determine the spectral model that best describes this source. We also examine
the low resolution optical spectrum for emission lines typical of cataclysmic
variables. Cross correlating the Halpha line in each individual spectrum also
allows us to search for orbital motion. Results. The X-ray spectrum reveals a
source best-fitted with a high-temperature bremsstrahlung model and an X-ray
unabsorbed luminosity of 1.8e32 erg/s (0.3-8.0 keV), which are typical of
cataclysmic variables. Optical spectra reveal Balmer emission lines, which are
indicative of an accretion disc. Potential radial velocity in the Halpha
emission line is detected and a period for CV1 is proposed. Conclusions. These
observations support the CV identification. The radial velocity measurements
suggest that CV1 may have an orbital period of ~7 hours, but further higher
resolution optical spectroscopy of CV1 is needed to unequivocally establish the
nature of this CV and its orbital period.

outflows in quasars. The first study uses new Chandra X-ray and ground-based
rest-frame UV observations of 7 quasars with mini-BALs at extreme high speeds,
in the range 0.1c to 0.2c, to test the idea that strong radiative shielding is
needed to moderate the mini-BAL ionizations and facilitate their acceleration
to extreme speeds. We find that the X-ray absorption is weak or absent, with
generally N_H < few x 10^22 mc^-2, and that radiative shielding is not
important. We argue that the mini-BAL ionizations are controlled, instead, by
high gas densities of order n_H ~ 4 x 10^8 cm^-3 in small outflow
substructures. If we conservatively assume that the total column density in the
mini-BAL gas is N_H < 10^22 cm^-2, covering >15% of the UV continuum source
along our lines of sight (based on measured line depths), then the radial
thickness of these outflows is only Delta_R < 3 x 10^13 cm and their transverse
size is > 8 x 10^15 cm. Thus the outflow regions have the shape of very thin
""pancakes"" viewed face-on, or they occupy larger volumes like a spray of dense
cloudlets with a very small volume filling factor. We speculate that this
situation (with ineffective shielding and small dense outflow substructures)
applies to most quasar outflows, including BALs. Our second study focuses from
BALs of low-abundance ions, mainly PV 1118,1128 A, whose significant strengths
imply large column densities, N_H > 10^22 cm^-2, that can further challenge
models of the outflow acceleration. In spite of the difficulties of finding
this line in the Ly-alpha forest, a search through the SDSS DR9 quasar catalog
reveals >50 BAL sources at redshifts z>2.3 with strong PV BALs, which we are

application throughput, recent research works have embedded application
deadline information into design of network flow schedule to meet the latency
requirement. Here, arises a critical question: does application-level
throughput mean providing better quality service? We note that there are
usually a set of semantic related responses (or flows) for answering a query;
and, some responses are highly correlative with the query while others do not.
Thus, this observation motivates us to associate the importance of the contents
with the application flows (or responses) in order to enhance the service
quality. We first model the application importance maximization problem in a
generic network and in a server-centric network. Since both of them are too
complicated to be deployed in the real world, we propose the importance-aware
delivery protocol, which is a distributed event-driven rate-based delivery
control protocol, for server-centric datacenter networks. The proposed protocol
is able to make use of the multiple disjoin paths of server-centric network,
and jointly consider flow importance, flow size, and deadline to maximize the
goodput of most-related semantic data of a query. Through real-data-based or

oscillator phase locked to 1 GHz output derived from a cryogenic sapphire
oscillator.

intensive research in various communities of wave dynamics, e.g., optics,
electromagnetics, acoustics, etc. However, their inhomogeneous and extreme
parameters imposed by transformation-optic method will usually require
challenging realization with metamaterials, resulting in narrow bandwidth,
loss, polarization-dependence, etc. On the contrary, we demonstrate that
tunable thermodynamic cloak can be achieved with homogeneous and finite
conductivity only employing naturally available materials. The controlled
localization of thermal distribution inside the coating layer has been
presented, and it shows that an incomplete cloak can function perfectly.
Practical realization of such homogeneous thermal cloak has been suggested by
using two naturally occurring conductive materials, which provides an
unprecedentedly plausible way to flexibly realize flexible thermal cloak and
manipulate thermal flow.

group of late type galaxies, Holmberg 124 made using archival data from the
Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT). Holmberg 124 is a group of four late
type galaxies: NGC 2805, NGC 2814, NGC 2820 and Mrk 108. We detect spectral
line emission from all the four galaxies and note several signatures of tidal
interactions among the member galaxies. Our results for the triplet (namely NGC
2820, NGC 2814 and Mrk 108) confirm the earlier results of Kantharia et al.
(2005) notably the detection of a possible tidal dwarf galaxy to the north-east
of NGC 2820. Further, in these images where the pointing center of the
observations was changed, we have recovered most of the H{\sc i} emission in
NGC 2805 as compared to Kantharia et al. (2005). We also report possible
detection of small discrete clouds between NGC 2820 and NGC 2805 which might be
stripped H{\sc i} in the intragroup medium (IGrM). However, these need
confirmation.

with a three-dimensional model of coronal heating using reduced
magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD), we have obtained scaling results of heating rate
versus Lundquist number based on a series of runs in which random photospheric
motions are imposed for hundreds to thousands of \al time in order to obtain
converged statistical values. The heating rate found in these simulations
saturate to a level that is independent of the Lundquist number. This scaling
result was also supported by an analysis with the assumption of the
Sweet-Parker scaling of the current sheets, as well as how the width, length
and number of current sheets scale with Lundquist number. In order to test
these assumptions, we have implemented an automated routine to analyze
thousands of current sheets in these simulations and return statistical
scalings for these quantities. It is found that the Sweet-Parker scaling is
justified. However, some discrepancies are also found and require further
study.

"1302.0860","Howard Reiss","H. R. Reiss","Incompatibility of the tunneling limit with laser fields",,,,,"quant-ph physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Schwinger limit refers to longitudinal electric fields that are
sufficiently strong to ""polarize the vacuum"" into electron-positron pairs by a
tunneling mechanism. Laser fields are transverse electromagnetic fields for
which the Schwinger limit has no relevance. Longitudinal and transverse fields
are fundamentally different because of the different values of the
F^{{\mu}{\nu}}F_{{\mu}{\nu}} Lorentz invariant that characterizes the fields.
One aspect of this difference is the zero-frequency limit, that exists for
longitudinal fields, but is ill-defined for transverse fields. The goal of
approaching the Schwinger limit with sufficiently strong lasers is thus not a
possibility. Tunneling transition rates are characterized by an exponential
behavior of the form exp(-C/E), where E is the magnitude of the applied
electric field and C is a system-dependent constant. Searches for such behavior
within a Coulomb-gauge treatment of laser-induced processes are shown to fail.

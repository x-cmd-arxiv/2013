30-October 6, 2012. We describe a formula (obtained in joint work with Alvise
Trevisan) for computing the Betti numbers of real toric manifolds, based on a
study of cohomology with coefficients in rank one local systems for various
polyhedral products. Applying this formula, we recover Henderson's computation
of the Betti numbers of real Hessenberg varieties. We conclude with a
discussion of the formality question in this context.

consider a subset of non-local games: symmetric XOR games of $n$ players with
0-1 valued questions. For this class of games, each player receives an input
bit and responds with an output bit without communicating to the other players.
The winning condition only depends on XOR of output bits and is constant w.r.t.
permutation of players.
  We prove that for almost any $n$-player symmetric XOR game the entangled
value of the game is $\Theta (\frac{\sqrt{\ln{n}}}{n^{1/4}})$ adapting an old

Mirror Descent algorithm or Nesterov's optimal algorithm of smooth convex
optimization, are well known to have optimal (theoretical) complexity estimates
which do not depend on the problem dimension. However, to attain the
optimality, the domain of the problem should admit a ""good proximal setup"". The
latter essentially means that 1) the problem domain should satisfy certain
geometric conditions of ""favorable geometry"", and 2) the practical use of these
methods is conditioned by our ability to compute at a moderate cost {\em
proximal transformation} at each iteration. More often than not these two
conditions are satisfied in optimization problems arising in computational
learning, what explains why proximal type FO methods recently became methods of
choice when solving various learning problems. Yet, they meet their limits in
several important problems such as multi-task learning with large number of
tasks, where the problem domain does not exhibit favorable geometry, and
learning and matrix completion problems with nuclear norm constraint, when the
numerical cost of computing proximal transformation becomes prohibitive in
large-scale problems. We propose a novel approach to solving nonsmooth
optimization problems arising in learning applications where Fenchel-type
representation of the objective function is available. The approach is based on
applying FO algorithms to the dual problem and using the {\em accuracy
certificates} supplied by the method to recover the primal solution. While
suboptimal in terms of accuracy guaranties, the proposed approach does not rely
upon ""good proximal setup"" for the primal problem but requires the problem
domain to admit a Linear Optimization oracle -- the ability to efficiently
maximize a linear form on the domain of the primal problem.

similar events (GRB 111209A and GRB 121027A) lie at z=0.677 and z=1.773
respectively. The systems show extremely unusual X-ray and optical lightcurves,
very different from classical GRBs, with long lasting highly variable X-ray
emission and optical light curves that exhibit little correlation with the
behaviour seen in the X-ray. Their host galaxies are faint, compact, and highly
star forming dwarf galaxies, typical of ""blue compact galaxies"". We propose
that these bursts are the prototypes of a hitherto largely unrecognized
population of ultra-long GRBs, that while observationally difficult to detect
may be astrophysically relatively common. The long durations may naturally be
explained by the engine driven explosions of stars of much larger radii than
normally considered for GRB progenitors which are thought to have compact
Wolf-Rayet progenitor stars. However, we cannot unambiguously identify
supernova signatures within their light curves or spectra. We also consider the
alternative possibility that they arise from the tidal disruption of stars by

Tl1+ and Tl3+ were located in two different crystallographic positions that

found in the Tl1+ position. The charge ordering between Tl1+ and Tl3+ was
confirmed by x-ray absorption and Raman spectroscopy. The Raman spectroscopy of
CsTlCl3 under high pressure (58 GPa) did not indicate any phase transition to a
possible single Tl2+ state. However, the highly insulating material becomes
less resistive with increasing high pressure, while undergoing a change in the
optical properties, from transparent to deeply opaque red, indicative of a
decrease of the band gap. The theoretical design and experimental validation of
the existence of CsTlF3 and CsTlCl3 cubic perovskites is the necessary first
step in confirming the theoretical prediction of superconductivity in these

Higgs boson. We point out the possibility that the Higgs bosons appear in
models of top-quark condensation, where the masses of the bosonic excitations
are related to the top quark mass by the sum rule similar to the Nambu sum rule
of the NJL models \cite{Nambu}. This rule was originally considered by Nambu
for superfluid $^3$He-B and for the BCS model of superconductivity. It relates
the two masses of bosonic excitations existing in each channel of Cooper
pairing to the fermion mass. An example of the Nambu partners is provided by
the amplitude and the phase modes in the BCS model describing Cooper pairing in
the s-wave channel. This sum rule suggests the existence of the Nambu partners
for the 125 GeV Higgs boson. Their masses can be predicted by the Nambu sum
rule under certain circumstances. For example, if there are only two states in
the given channel, the mass of the Nambu partner is $\sim$ 325 GeV. They
together satisfy the Nambu sum rule $M_1^2 + M_2^2 = 4 M_t^2$, where $M_t \sim
$174 GeV is the mass of the top quark. If there are two doubly degenerated
states, then the second mass is $\sim$ 210 GeV. In this case the Nambu sum rule
is $2 M_1^2 + 2 M_2^2 = 4 M_t^2$. In addition, the properties of the Higgs
modes in superfluid $^3$He-A, where the symmetry breaking is similar to that of
the Standard Model of particle physics, suggest the existence of two
electrically charged Higgs particles with masses around 245 GeV, which together
also obey the Nambu sum rule $M_+^2 + M_-^2 = 4 M_t^2$.

a boundary, that implies that the auxiliary field has a non-zero expectation
value, signalling spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. This is due to the
presence of ""fermionic"" zeromodes, whose contribution cannot be cancelled by a
surface term. This we prove by an explicit calculation of the regularized
partition function, as well as by computing the moments of the auxiliary field
and checking whether they satisfy the identities implied by Wick's theorem.
Nevertheless, supersymmetry manifests itself in the identities that are
satisfied by the moments of the scalar, whose expressions we can calculate,for
all values of the coupling constant. We also provide some quantitative
estimates concerning the visibility of supersymmetry breaking effects in the

two models with dynamical dark energy, viewed as a quintessence scalar field
[using a Ratra and Peebles (RP) and a supergravity (SUGRA) potential form], and
two extended quintessence models, one with positive and one with negative
coupling (EQp and EQn respectively), where the quintessence scalar field
interacts non-minimally with gravity (scalar-tensor theories). All the models
are normalized in order to match CMB data from Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy
Probe 3 (WMAP3). [Abridged] We consider both the complete catalog of clusters
and groups and a subsample of relaxed objects. The c-M relation of our
reference LambdaCDM model is in good agreement with the results in literature,
and relaxed objects have a higher normalization and a shallower slope with
respect to the complete sample. For the different dark energy models, we find
that for LambdaCDM, RP and SUGRA the normalization of the c-M relation is
linked to the growth factor D+ and the power spectrum normalization sigma8,
with models having a higher value of sigma8 D+ having also a higher
normalization. This simple scheme is no longer valid for EQp and EQn because in
these models it is present a time dependent effective gravitational
interaction, whose redshift evolution depends on the sign of the coupling. This
leads to a decrease (increase) of the expected normalization in the EQp (EQn)
model. This result shows a direct manifestation of the coupling between gravity
and the quintessence scalar field characterizing EQ models that cannot be seen
at the background level but can be investigated in the non-linear regime.

revealed the presence of a trigonal strain as high as 0.7 % in some samples.

effort to detect the extremely weak signals generated by expected sources. With
the next round of upgrades the ground based instruments are likely to make the
first detections of the sources, and a new era of astronomy will begin,
possibly as early as 2017. Inconveniently, due to seismic noise and baseline
length issues, the low frequency (<10Hz) part of the spectrum, where the most
interesting events are expected, will not be accessible. The space-based
detector, LISA1, was conceived to fill this gap extending the observational
capability to about 10-4 Hz. Due to mission cost growth and severe budget
constraints, a flight prior to 2030 now seems very unlikely. This paper
examines the case for a scaled down mission that is comparable in cost and
duration to medium scale astrophysics missions such as the 1978 ($630M)
Einstein (HEAO 2) x-ray Observatory2, the 1989 ($680M) COBE Cosmic Background

We find that a mission of this class is possible if the measurement
requirements are somewhat relaxed and a baseline smaller than LISA is used. It
appears that such a mission could be launched by 2020 using a conventional
program development plan, possibly including international collaboration. It
would enable the timely development of this game-changing field of
astrophysics, complementing the expected ground results with observations of
massive black hole collisions. It would also serve as a stepping stone to LISA,
greatly reducing the risk profile of that mission.

Four texture zeros in the Yukawa coupling matrix is equivalent to either a
single texture zero or a single cofactor zero for an off-diagonal element of

D. thesis of the author",,,,"math.MG math.DG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We prove some rigidity theorems for configurations of closed disks. First,
fix two collections $\mathcal{C}$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{C}}$ of closed disks in
the Riemann sphere $\hat{\mathbb{C}}$, sharing a contact graph which
(mostly-)triangulates $\hat{\mathbb{C}}$, so that for all corresponding pairs
of intersecting disks $D_i, D_j \in \mathcal{C}$ and $\tilde D_i, \tilde D_j
\in \tilde{\mathcal{C}}$ we have that the overlap angle between $D_i$ and $D_j$
agrees with that between $\tilde D_i$ and $\tilde D_j$. We require the extra
condition that the collections are ""thin"", meaning that no pair of disks of
$\mathcal{C}$ meet in the interior of a third, and similarly for
$\tilde{\mathcal{C}}$. Then $\mathcal{C}$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{C}}$ differ by a
M\""obius or anti-M\""obius transformation. We also prove the analogous
statements for collections of closed disks in the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$,
and in the hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H}^2$.
  Our method of proof is elementary and self-contained, relying only on plane
topology arguments and manipulations by M\""obius transformations. In
particular, we generalize a fixed-point argument which was previously applied
by Schramm and He to prove the analogs of our theorems in the circle-packing
setting, that is, where the disks in question are pairwise interiorwise
disjoint. It was previously thought that these methods of proof depended too
crucially on the pairwise interiorwise disjointness of the disks for there to
be a hope for generalizing them to the setting of configurations of overlapping
disks.
  We end by stating some open problems and conjectures, including conjectured
generalizations both of our main result and of our main technical theorem.

unknown obstacle is assumed to be sound-soft one. The governing equation of the
wave is given by the classical wave equation. The wave is generated by the
initial data localized outside the obstacle and observed over a finite time
interval at a place which is not necessary the same as the support of the
initial data. The observed data are the so-called bistatic data. In this paper,
an enclosure method which employs the bistatic data and is based on two main
analytical formulae, is developed. The first one enables us to extract the
maximum spheroid with focal points at the center of the support of the initial
data and that of the observation points whose exterior encloses the unknown
obstacle of general shape. The second one, under some technical assumption for
the obstacle including convexity as an example, indicates the deviation of the
geometry of the boundary of the obstacle and the maximum spheroid at the
contact points. Several implications of those two formulae are also given. In
particular, a constructive proof of a uniqueness of a spherical obstacle using

is true that the AGB populations show very different distributions then it
presents a serious problem for low mass stellar evolution theory, since such a
surface abundance change going from the RGB to AGB is not predicted by stellar
models. However this is only a tentative conclusion, since it is based on very
small AGB sample sizes. To test whether this problem really exists we have
carried out an observational campaign specifically targeting AGB stars in GCs.
We have obtained medium resolution spectra for about 250 AGB stars across 9
Galactic GCs using the multi-object spectrograph on the AAT (2df/AAOmega). We
present some of the preliminary findings of the study for the second parameter
trio of GCs: NGC 288, NGC 362 and NGC 1851. The results indeed show that there
is a deficiency of stars with strong CN bands on the AGB. To confirm that this
phenomenon is robust and not just confined to CN band strengths and their
vagaries, we have made observations using FLAMES/VLT to measure elemental
abundances for NGC 6752.We present some initial results from this study also.

need some smoothing property for the coefficient in front of the noise. The
main idea of this paper consists of expressing the stochastic integral in terms
of non-stochastic integrals and the noisy path by using an integration by

theorem it is crucial to have the H\""older norm of the noisy path to be
sufficiently small. Later, by using appropriate stopping times, we shall derive
the existence and uniqueness of a global mild solution. Furthermore, the

check for inconsistencies in our model of the Universe. In this paper we
develop a joint analysis framework for six different second-order statistics
calculated from three tracers of the dark matter density field, namely galaxy
position, shear, and magnification. We extend a data compression scheme
developed in the context of shear-shear statistics (the so-called COSEBIs) to
the other five second-order statistics, thereby significantly reducing the
number of data points in the joint data vector. We use CosmoLike, a newly
developed software framework for joint likelihood analyses, to forecast
parameter constraints for the Dark Energy Survey (DES). The simulated MCMCs
cover a five dimensional cosmological parameter space comparing the information
content of the individual probes to several combined probes (CP) data vectors.
Given the significant correlations of these second-order statistics we model
all cross terms in the covariance matrix; furthermore we go beyond the Gaussian
covariance approximation and use the halo model to include higher order
correlations of the density field. We find that adding magnification
information (including cross probes with shear and clustering) noticeably
increases the information content and that the correct modeling of the
covariance (i.e., accounting for non-Gaussianity and cross terms) is essential
for accurate likelihood contours from the CP data vector. We also identify
several nulltests based on the degeneracy of magnification and shear statistics
which can be used to quantify the contamination of data sets by astrophysical
systematics and/or calibration issues.

in an optical lattice and modeled by the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, using a
variety of numerical and analytical approaches. The dynamic structure factor,
experimentally measurable by Bragg spectroscopy, is studied in three relevant
cases: in the clean regime, featuring either a superfluid or a Mott phase; and
in the presence of two types of (quasi-)disordered external potentials: a
quasi-periodic potential obtained from a bichromatic superlattice and a
random-box disorder - both featuring a Bose glass phase. In the clean case, we
show the emergence of a gapped doublon mode (corresponding to a repulsively
bound state) for incommensurate filling, well separated from the low-energy
acoustic mode. In the disordered case, we show that the dynamic structure
factor provides a direct insight into the spatial structure of the excitations,
unveiling their localized nature, which represents a fundamental signature of
the Bose glass phase. Furthermore, it provides a clear fingerprint of the very
nature of the localization mechanism which differs for the two kinds of
disorder potentials we consider. In special cases, the dynamic structure factor
may provide an estimate of the position of the localization transition from
superfluid to Bose glass, in a complementary manner to the information deduced
from the momentum distribution.

that the subgraph induced by any two color classes is a linear forest (an
acyclic graph with maximum degree at most two). The {\em acyclic chromatic
index} $\chiup_{a}'(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the least number of colors needed in
an acyclic edge coloring of $G$. Fiam\v{c}\'{i}k (1978) conjectured that
$\chiup_{a}'(G) \leq \Delta(G) + 2$, where $\Delta(G)$ is the maximum degree of
$G$. This conjecture is well known as Acyclic Edge Coloring Conjecture (AECC).
A graph $G$ with maximum degree at most $\kappa$ is {\em
$\kappa$-deletion-minimal} if $\chiup_{a}'(G) > \kappa$ and $\chiup_{a}'(H)
\leq \kappa$ for every proper subgraph $H$ of $G$. The purpose of this paper is
to provide many structural lemmas on $\kappa$-deletion-minimal graphs. By using
the structural lemmas, we firstly prove that AECC is true for the graphs with
maximum average degree less than four (\autoref{NMAD4}). We secondly prove that
AECC is true for the planar graphs without triangles adjacent to cycles of
length at most four, with an additional condition that every $5$-cycle has at
most three edges contained in triangles (\autoref{NoAdjacent}), from which we
can conclude some known results as corollaries. We thirdly prove that every
planar graph $G$ without intersecting triangles satisfies $\chiup_{a}'(G) \leq
\Delta(G) + 3$ (\autoref{NoIntersect}). Finally, we consider one extreme case
and prove it: if $G$ is a graph with $\Delta(G) \geq 3$ and all the
$3^{+}$-vertices are independent, then $\chiup_{a}'(G) = \Delta(G)$. We hope
the structural lemmas will shed some light on the acyclic edge coloring

calculations at MP2/6-31G(d,p) level of theory. A comparison is made between
the calculated interaction energies and the experimental enthalpies of
microhydration of bases, obtained from mass spectrometry at low temperatures.
Each local water-base interaction energy minimum obtained with MM corresponds
to the minimum obtained with QM. General qualitative agreement was observed in
the geometrical characteristics of the local minima obtained via the two groups
of methods. MM minima correspond to slightly more coplanar structures than
those obtained via QM methods, and the absolute MM energy values overestimate
corresponding values obtained with QM. For Adenine and Thymine the QM local
minima energy values are closer to those obtained by the PM potential (average
of 0.72 kcal/mol) than by the AMBER force field (1.86 kcal/mol). The
differences in energy between MM and QM results are more pronounced for Guanine
and Cytosine, especially for minima with the water molecule forming H-bonds
with two proton-acceptor centers of the base. Such minima are the deepest ones
obtained via MM methods while QM calculations result in the global minima
corresponding to water molecule H-bonded to one acceptor and one donor site of
the base. Calculations for trimethylated bases with a water molecule
corroborate the MM results. The energy profiles were obtained with some degrees
of freedom of the water molecule being frozen. This data will contribute to the
improvement of the molecular mechanics force fields.

form of quartic polynomials. We find that a subset of such potentials has
simple analytic far-field solutions, and is a linear transformation of our
original potential. By scaling, we can relate their solutions to those of our
original potential. For special cases, the lengths of the sides of the small
triangle are proportional to the corresponding interfacial tensions. For the
case of equal interfacial tensions, we calculate a line tension that is

Raman scattering has the distinguishing features of high spatial resolution

require long measurement times to achieve broad spectral spans. Here we
overcome this difficulty and introduce a novel concept of coherent anti-Stokes

Co3+ is in the low-spin (LS) state. At T around T*, the sharp valence

compensation. This is accompanied by an equally sharp spin state transition of

reactive parameters, which depend on the type of the spatial support and which
allow for an effective MF description. As working example the Lattice Limit
Cycle dynamics is used, restricted on a 2D square lattice with nearest

when the kinetic rates are replaced with their effective values. The same
conclusion holds when reactive stochastic rewiring is introduced in the system
via long distance reactive coupling. Instead, when the stochastic coupling
becomes diffusive the effective parameters no longer predict the steady state.
This is attributed to the diffusion process which is an additional factor
introduced into the dynamics and is not accounted for, in the kinetic MF
scheme.

between the Hardy space $H^p$ and $\Dp$, the integral operator {displaymath}
T_g(f)(z)=\int_{0}^{z}f(\zeta)\,g'(\zeta)\,d\zeta,\quad z\in\D, {displaymath}
acting from one of these spaces to another is studied. In particular, it is
shown, on one hand, that $T_g:\Dp\to H^p$ is bounded if and only if $g\in\BMOA$
when $0<p\le 2$, and, on the other hand, that this equivalence is very far from
being true if $p>2$. Those symbols $g$ such that $T_g:\Dp\to H^q$ is bounded
(or compact) when $p<q$ are also characterized. Moreover, the best known
sufficient $L^\infty$-type condition for a positive Borel measure $\mu$ on $\D$
to be a $p$-Carleson measures for $\Dp$, $p>2$, is significantly relaxed, and
the established result is shown to be sharp in a very strong sense.

linearly on a small variable $\varepsilon$, the successive derivatives of the

control over the perturbative QCD corrections, the non-perturbative condensate
contributions in the framework of the operator product expansion (OPE), as well

required. On the perturbative QCD side, the contour-improved versus fixed-order

the analysis, self-consistent fits to the data including all theory parameters
have to be performed, and this is also explained in some detail. The fit
quantities are moment integrals of the tau spectral function data in a certain

species whose evolution is not treelike, which is the case, for instance, in

inference methods such as Maximum Parsimony need to be modified in order to be
applicable to networks. In this paper, we discuss two different definitions of
Maximum Parsimony on networks, ""hardwired"" and ""softwired"", and examine the
complexity of computing them given a network topology and a character. By
exploiting a link with the problem Multicut, we show that computing the
hardwired parsimony score for 2-state characters is polynomial-time solvable,
while for characters with more states this problem becomes NP-hard but is still
approximable and fixed parameter tractable in the parsimony score. On the other
hand we show that, for the softwired definition, obtaining even weak
approximation guarantees is already difficult for binary characters and
restricted network topologies, and fixed-parameter tractable algorithms in the
parsimony score are unlikely. On the positive side we show that computing the
softwired parsimony score is fixed-parameter tractable in the level of the
network, a natural parameter describing how tangled reticulate activity is in
the network. Finally, we show that both the hardwired and softwired parsimony
score can be computed efficiently using Integer Linear Programming. The

$\pi^{0}\to \gamma\gamma$ decay rate shows that non-anomaly terms would make a
negligible contribution to the decay rate, in agreement with the
Sutherland-Veltman theorem. Thus the conventional $q\bar{q}$ bound-state
description of the pion could not be valid since it would produce a $\pi^{0}\to
\gamma\gamma$ decay amplitude not suppressed in the soft pion limit, in
contradiction with the Sutherland-Veltman theorem. Therefore, if the pion is to
be treated as a $q\bar{q}$ bound state, this bound state would be a
longitudinal axial-vector meson. In this paper, we consider the pion to be a
longitudinal axial-vector meson $q\bar{q}$ bound state with derivative coupling
for the pion $q\bar{q}$ Bethe-Salpeter(BS) wave function. We shall show that
this BS wave function could produce a suppressed $\pi^{0}\to \gamma\gamma$
decay amplitude in the soft pion limit, in agreement with the
Sutherland-Veltman theorem. This explains the almost perfect agreement of the
anomaly prediction with experiment and the suppression of the virtual
one-photon exchange contribution in $\eta\to 3\pi$ decay. The Goldstone boson
equivalence theorem used for longitudinal gauge bosons scattering in the
electroweak standard model then identifies the longitudinal axial-vector meson
$q\bar{q}$ bound state with the pion.

atmosphere models. Exoplanet searches have unveiled a large population of
short-period objects with hot atmospheres, very different from what we find in
our solar system. Transiting exoplanets whose atmospheres can now be studied by
transit spectroscopy receive extremely strong UV fluxes and have typical
temperatures ranging from 400 to 2500 K. At these temperatures, UV photolysis
cross section data are severely lacking. Aims. Our goal is to provide
high-temperature absorption cross sections and their temperature dependency for
important atmospheric compounds. This study is dedicated to CO2, which is
observed and photodissociated in exoplanet atmospheres. We also investigate the
influence of these new data on the photochemistry of some exoplanets. We
performed these measurements for the 115 - 200 nm range at 300, 410, 480, and
550 K. In the 195 - 230 nm range, we worked at seven temperatures between 465
and 800 K. We implemented the measured cross section into a 1D photochemical
model. For wavelengths > 170 nm, the wavelength dependence of
ln(cross-section_CO2(wavelength, T)x1/Qv(T)) can be parametrized with a linear
law. Thus, we can interpolate cross-section_CO2(wavelength, T) at any
temperature between 300 and 800 K. Within the studied range of temperature, the
CO2 cross section can vary by more than two orders of magnitude. This, in
particular, makes the absorption of CO2 significant up to wavelengths as high
as 230 nm. The absorption cross section of CO2 is very sensitive to
temperature. The model predicts that accounting for this temperature dependency
of CO2 cross section can affect the computed abundances of NH3, CO2, and CO by
one order of magnitude in the atmospheres of hot Jupiter and hot Neptune. This
effect will be more important in hot CO2-dominated atmospheres.

feedback from winds and supernovae on inhomogeneous molecular material left
over from the formation of a massive stellar cluster. We simulate the
interaction of the mechanical energy input from a cluster with 3 O-stars into a
giant molecular cloud (GMC) clump containing 3240 solar masses of molecular
material within a 4 pc radius. The cluster wind blows out of the molecular
clump along low-density channels, into which denser clump material is
entrained. We find that the densest molecular regions are surprisingly
resistant to ablation by the cluster wind, in part due to shielding by other
dense regions closer to the cluster. Nonetheless, molecular material is
gradually removed by the cluster wind during which mass-loading factors in
excess of several 100 are obtained. Because the clump is very porous, 60-75 per
cent of the injected wind energy escapes the simulation domain, with the
difference being radiated. After 4.4 Myr, the massive stars in our simulation
begin to explode as supernovae. The highly structured environment into which
the SN energy is released allows even weaker coupling to the remaining dense
material and practically all of the SN energy reaches the wider environment.
The molecular material is almost completely dispersed and destroyed after 6
Myr. The escape fraction of ionizing radiation is estimated to be about 50 per
cent during the first 4 Myr of the cluster's life. A similar model with a
larger and more massive GMC clump reveals the same general picture, though more
time is needed for it to be destroyed.

central black hole and for obtaining a firm description of the contribution of
AGN to the Cosmic X-ray Background. Although broad-band X-ray measurements of
AGN have been made in the past, these did not generally pertain to a complete
sample of sources. Since few years, we have started a systematic analysis of
the 0.1-100 keV spectra of a complete sample of AGN selected in the hard X-ray

of operating X-ray telescopes. Thanks to data obtained through an XMM-Newton
Large Programme, we have now high quality 0.1-10 keV data for all sources in
the sample; these combined with high energy observations from INTEGRAL/IBIS and
Swift/BAT will allow us to study the spectral properties of this complete
sample. Here in particular, we report the progress made on type 1 AGN, focusing
in particular on the continuum and its high energy cut-off, the reflection

achieved by solving a semi-infinite optimization problem, where the dynamics
enter the problem as constraints. The proof of existence of a solution for an

to the case of realistic combustion models including thermochemistry by
considering the properties of proper maps. The model reduction approach is
finally applied to three models based on realistic reaction mechanisms: 1.

2-fluid model (of plasma and neutrals) and used it to perform 1D simulations of
Alfv\'en waves in a solar atmosphere with realistic density and temperature
structure. Studies of a range of solar features (faculae, plage, penumbra and
umbra) show that energy transmission from corona to chromosphere can exceed 20%
of incident energy for wave periods of one second or less. Damping of waves in
the chromosphere depends strongly on wave frequency: waves with periods 10
seconds or longer pass through the chromosphere with relatively little damping,
however, for periods of 1 second or less, a substantial fraction (37%-100%) of
wave energy entering the chromosphere is damped by ion-neutral friction in the
mid and upper chromosphere, with electron resistivity playing some role in the
lower chromosphere and in umbras. We therefore conclude that Alfv\'enic waves
with periods of a few seconds or less are capable of heating the chromosphere
during solar flares, and speculate that they could also contribute to electron
acceleration or exciting sunquakes.

interaction of the SNR shock wave with the ambient interstellar medium (ISM).
Methods: The Lobe and the northeastern part of the SNR were observed with
Chandra ACIS-I. We analysed the spectrum of the X-ray emission by dividing the
entire observed emission into small regions. The X-ray emission is best
reproduced with one-component or two-component non-equilibrium ionisation
models depending on the position. In the two-component model one emission
component represents the shocked ISM and the other the shocked ejecta. Results:
We detect enhanced element abundances, in particular for Si and Fe, in and
around the Lobe. There is one particular region next to the Lobe with a high Si
abundance of 3.3 (2.6 - 4.0) times the solar value. This is the first,
unequivocal detection of ejecta in CTB 109. Conclusions: The new Chandra data
confirm that the Lobe was created by the interaction of the SNR shock and the
supernova ejecta with dense and inhomogeneous medium in the environment of SNR
CTB 109. The newly calculated age of the SNR is t ~ 1.4 x 10^4 yr.

from a finite simplicial complex K. When this construction is applied to a

polytope, the result is a manifold. Moment-angle manifolds and complexes are
central objects in toric topology, and currently are gaining much interest in
homotopy theory, complex and symplectic geometry.
  The geometric aspects of the theory of moment-angle complexes are the main
theme of this survey. We review constructions of non-Kahler complex-analytic
structures on moment-angle manifolds corresponding to polytopes and complete
simplicial fans, and describe invariants of these structures, such as the Hodge
numbers and Dolbeault cohomology rings. Symplectic and Lagrangian aspects of
the theory are also of considerable interest. Moment-angle manifolds appear as
level sets for quadratic Hamiltonians of torus actions, and can be used to
construct new families of Hamiltonian-minimal Lagrangian submanifolds in a
complex space, complex projective space or toric varieties.

Consequently, as long as the actual fault is unknown, there is always some risk

achieved and minimizes the risk of using low-quality meta information.
Therefore, this method is suitable for application scenarios where reliable

controlled setting. We found that the adjustment of individual guesses depends
linearly on the distance to the mean of all guesses. This is a remarkable, and

Rayleigh block-fading multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel with T
transmit antennas and R receive antennas in the noncoherent setting (no a
priori channel knowledge at the transmitter and the receiver). In this model,
the fading process changes independently across blocks of length L and is
temporally correlated within each block for each transmit-receive antenna pair,
with a given rank Q of the corresponding correlation matrix. Our result implies
that for almost all choices of the coloring matrix that models the temporal
correlation, the pre-log can be lower-bounded by T(1-1/L) for T <= (L-1)/Q
provided that R is sufficiently large. The widely used constant block-fading
model is equivalent to the temporally correlated block-fading model with Q = 1
for the special case when the temporal correlation for each transmit-receive
antenna pair is the same, which is unlikely to be observed in practice. For the
constant block-fading model, the capacity pre-log is given by T(1-T/L), which
is smaller than our lower bound for the case Q = 1. Thus, our result suggests
that the assumptions underlying the constant block- fading model lead to a
pessimistic result for the capacity pre-log.

tight-binding model and a recursive Green's function technique that we extend
to deal with periodic structures, we calculate Hofstadter butterflies of GALs.
We compare the results to those obtained in a simpler gapped graphene model. A
crucial difference emerges in the behaviour of the lowest Landau level, which
in a gapped graphene model is independent of magnetic field. In stark contrast
to this picture, we find that in GALs the band gap can be completely closed by
applying a magnetic field. While our numerical simulations can only be
performed on structures much smaller than can be experimentally realized, we
find that the critical magnetic field for which the gap closes can be directly
related to the ratio between the cyclotron radius and the neck width of the
GAL. In this way, we obtain a simple scaling law for extrapolation of our
results to more realistically sized structures and find resulting quenching
magnetic fields that should be well within reach of experiments.

proto-white dwarfs/sdB stars, with a gravity log(g)=4.9+/-0.3, and effective
temperature 16000+/-500 K. The strongest lines in the spectrum are from
hydrogen, but numerous lines from helium, calcium, silicon, and magnesium are
present as well, with implied abundances of roughly ten times solar (relative
to hydrogen). As such, while from the spectrum the companion to PSR J1816+4510

gravity, is substantially larger, and shows substantial metals. Furthermore, it
is able to produce ionized gas eclipses, which had previously been seen only
for low-mass, non-degenerate companions in redback or black widow systems. We
discuss the companion in relation to other sources, but find we understand

amounts of residual gas after the initial formation of the first stellar
generation. Recently, Krause et al. (2012) found that supernovae may not be
able to expel that gas, as required to explain their present day gas-free
state, and suggested that a sudden accretion on to the dark remnants, at a
stage when type II supernovae have ceased, may plausibly lead to fast gas
expulsion. Here, we explore the consequences of these results for the
self-enrichment scenario via fast rotating massive stars (FRMS). We analyse the
interaction of FRMS with the intra-cluster medium (ICM), in particular where,
when and how the second generation of stars may form. From the results, we
develop a timeline of the first approximately 40 Myr of GC evolution. The
results of Paper I imply three phases during which the ICM is in a
fundamentally different state, namely the wind bubble phase (lasting 3.5 to 8.8
Myr), the supernova phase (lasting 26.2 to 31.5 Myr), and the dark remnant
accretion phase (lasting 0.1 to 4 Myr): (i) Quickly after the first generation
massive stars have formed, stellar wind bubbles compress the ICM into thin
filaments. No stars may form in the normal way during this phase, due to the
high Lyman-Werner flux density. If the first generation massive stars have
however equatorial ejections, as we proposed in the FRMS scenario, accretion
may resume in the shadow of the equatorial ejecta. The second generation stars
may then form due to gravitational instability in these discs that are fed by
both the FRMS ejecta and pristine gas. [...]

viruses and a polymer depletant can assume a variety of shapes such as flat
disks and twisted ribbons. A theoretical model based on the de Gennes model for
the smectic A phase, the Helfrich model of membrane elasticity and a simple
edge energy has been previously used to calculate the disk-ribbon phase
diagram. In this paper we apply this model to the nucleation process of
ribbons. First, we study the ""rippled disks"" that have been observed as
precursors of ribbons. Using a model shape proposed by Meyer which includes
rippling in both the in-plane and out of plane directions, we study the
energetics of the disks as functions of the edge energy modulus (a measure of
the polymer concentration) and the mean curvature modulus k. We find that as
the edge energy modulus is reduced the radial size of the ripples grows rapidly
in agreement with experimental observations. For small enough k we find that
the out of plane size of the ripples grows but its value saturates at a
fraction of the twist penetration depth, too small to be experimentally
observable. For large k the membrane remains flat though rippled in the radial
direction. Such membranes do not have negative Gaussian curvature and thus will
not likely spawn twisted ribbons. We also study the creation of twisted ribbons
produced by stretching the edge of a flat membrane in a localized region. In
experiments using a pair of optical traps it has been observed that once the
membrane has been sufficiently stretched a ribbon forms on the stretched edge.
We study this process theoretically using a free energy consisting of the
Helfrich and edge energies alone. We add a small ribbon-like perturbation to
the protrusion producd by stretching and determine whether it is energetically
favorable as a function of the size of the protrusion.

ability of these systems to profile users is what enables such intelligent
functionality, but at the same time, it is the source of serious privacy
concerns. In this paper we investigate a privacy-enhancing technology that aims
at hindering an attacker in its efforts to accurately profile users based on
the items they rate. Our approach capitalizes on the combination of two
perturbative mechanisms---the forgery and the suppression of ratings. While
this technique enhances user privacy to a certain extent, it inevitably comes
at the cost of a loss in data utility, namely a degradation of the
recommendation's accuracy. In short, it poses a trade-off between privacy and
utility.
  The theoretical analysis of said trade-off is the object of this work. We
measure privacy as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the user's and the
population's item distributions, and quantify utility as the proportion of
ratings users consent to forge and eliminate. Equipped with these quantitative
measures, we find a closed-form solution to the problem of optimal forgery and
suppression of ratings, and characterize the trade-off among privacy, forgery
rate and suppression rate. Experimental results on a popular recommendation
system show how our approach may contribute to privacy enhancement.

and/or dense stellar systems. The question about their modes of formation is
still under debate. A likely explanation of the formation of the central dense
stellar systems in both spiral and elliptical galaxies is based on the orbital
decay of massive globular clusters in the central region of galaxies due to
kinetic energy dissipation by dynamical friction. Their merging leads to the
formation of a nuclear star cluster, like that of the Milky Way, where a
massive black hole (Sgr A*) is also present. Actually, high precision N-body
simulations (Antonini, Capuzzo-Dolcetta et al. 2012, ApJ, 750, 111) show a good
fit to the observational characteristics of the Milky Way nuclear cluster,
giving further reliability to the cited `migratory' model for the formation of
compact systems in the inner galaxy regions.

compact radio emission of young stellar objects. At the same time, such
measurements can be used for precise astrometric measurements of parallaxes and
proper motions. Here, we aimed to make the first detections of very compact
radio emission from class I protostars in the Corona Australis star-forming
region. Methods: We have used the Long Baseline Array (LBA) to observe the
protostars IRS 5 and IRS 7 in the Corona Australis star-forming region in three
separate epochs Results: We report the first firm radio detection of a class I
protostar using very long baseline interferometry. We have detected the
previously known non-thermal source IRS 5b, part of a binary system. IRS 5a and
IRS 5N were undetected, as were all sources in the IRS 7 region. Conclusions:
These results underline the unusual nature of IRS 5b as a genuine protostar
with confirmed non-thermal radio emission. Also, these observations highlight
the potential of the LBA as a tool to provide precision astrometric
measurements of individual young stellar objects in southern star-forming
regions that are not accessible to the Very Long Baseline Array in the northern
hemisphere.

polydisperse, frictionless sphere packings at the random closed packing density
through simulations. We observe universal correlations between particle size
and contact number that are independent of the polydispersity of the packing.
This allows us to formulate a mean field version of the granocentric model to
predict the contact number distribution P(z). We find the predictions to be in
good agreement with a wide range of discrete and continuous size distributions.
The values of the two parameters that appear in the model are also independent
of the polydispersity of the packing. Finally we look at the nearest neighbour
spatial correlations to investigate the validity of the granocentric approach.
We find that both particle size and contact number are anti-correlated which
contrasts with the assumptions of the granocentric model. Despite this
shortcoming, the correlations are sufficiently weak which explains the good
approximation of P(z) obtained from the model.

when studying the heating of solar flare footpoints. However, determining this
for impulsive phase footpoints has been difficult in the past due to
insufficient spatial resolution to resolve the footpoints from the loop
structures, and a lack of spectral and temporal coverage. We use the
capabilities of Hinode/EIS to obtain the first emission measure distributions
(EMDs) from impulsive phase footpoints in six flares. Observations with good
spectral coverage were analysed using a regularized inversion method to recover
the EMDs. We find that the EMDs all share a peak temperature of around 8 MK,
with lines formed around this temperature having emission measures peaking
between 10^28 and 10^29 cm^-5, indicating a substantial presence of plasma at
very high temperatures within the footpoints. An EMD gradient of EM(T) ~ T is
found in all events. Previous theoretical work on emission measure gradients
shows this to be consistent with a scenario in which the deposited flare energy
directly heats only the top layer of the flare chromosphere, while deeper
layers are heated by conduction.

more mid-infrared emission relative to their near-infrared and FIR emission

We find increases in the dust luminosity and mass, SFR, and cold (15-25 K) dust

includes the gravity force of the stellar component and a central supermassive

that a filamentary/clumpy structure is formed in the inner part of the cluster.

approaches is presented, all based on linear encoders.
  The first approach uses a common matrix to encode all the sources and a
Korner-Marton like receiver to directly compute $W$. The second improves upon
the first by showing that it is often more efficient to compute a carefully
chosen superspace $U$ of $W$. The superspace is identified by showing that the
joint distribution of the $\{X_i\}$ induces a unique decomposition of the set
of all linear combinations of the $\{X_i\}$, into a chain of subspaces
identified by a normalized measure of entropy. This subspace chain also
suggests a third approach, one that employs nested codes. For any joint
distribution of the $\{X_i\}$ and any $W$, the sum-rate of the nested code
approach is no larger than that under the Slepian-Wolf (SW) approach. Under the
SW approach, $W$ is computed by first recovering each of the $\{X_i\}$. For a
large class of joint distributions and subspaces $W$, the nested code approach
is shown to improve upon SW. Additionally, a class of source distributions and
subspaces are identified, for which the nested-code approach is sum-rate
optimal.

of the high-mobility clusters and strings is associated with a diffusive time
scale, while the low-mobility particles' time scale relates to a structural
relaxation time. We find a high degree of similarity in the geometrical
structure of these particle clusters. In particular, we show that the fractal
dimensions of these clusters are consistent with those of swollen branched

contrast, the fractal dimension of the strings crosses over from that of
self-avoiding walks for small strings, to simple random walks for longer, {more

excluded-volume interactions. We examine the appropriateness of identifying the
size scales of either mobile particle clusters or strings with the size of
cooperatively rearranging regions (CRR) in the AG and RFOT theories. We find
that the string size appears to be the most consistent measure of CRR for both

supernova 2010mc (PTF 10tel) was energized by mass accretion onto an O
main-sequence stellar companion. According to this suggestion the SN progenitor
suffered a rapid expansion within months before explosion. The expansion was
driven by leakage of energy from the core where vigorous oxygen nuclear burning
takes place within a year prior to explosion. This expansion triggered mass
transfer onto the secondary star. Most of the extra energy of the outburst
comes from the accretion of ~0.1Mo onto the secondary star. As well, the gas
outflowing at v~2000 km/s was launched from the accreting secondary star, most
likely in a bipolar outflow. The binary model can account for the slower
circumstellar medium that was ejected at earlier times, and explain the
red-shifted peak of the Halpha emission at 5.8 days past explosion. I compare
some properties of the PEO of SN 2010mc to those of other stellar eruptions,
such as the stellar merger event V838 Monocerotis and the nineteenth century
Great Eruption of the massive stellar binary system Eta Carinae. I speculate

No evidence is found for any magnetic fluctuations in the spectrum of either
material in the energy and wavevector ranges probed. Special attention is paid
to the wavevector at which spin-density-wave-like fluctuations are seen in
other iron-based superconductors. We estimate that the magnetic signal, if
present, is at least a factor of four (Sr2ScO3FeP) or seven (LaFePO) smaller
than in the related iron arsenide and chalcogenide superconductors. These
results suggest that magnetic fluctuations are not as influential on the
electronic properties of the iron phosphide systems as they are in other
iron-based superconductors.

unauthorized viewers and the use of algorithmic recognition technologies by
providers. To address these concerns, we propose a privacy-preserving photo
encoding algorithm that extracts and encrypts a small, but significant,
component of the photo, while preserving the remainder in a public,
standards-compatible, part. These two components can be separately stored. This
technique significantly reduces the signal-to-noise ratio and the accuracy of
automated detection and recognition on the public part, while preserving the
ability of the provider to perform server-side transformations to conserve

commonly studied using the local-density approximation + dynamical mean-field
theory approach. Typically, however, such simulations are restricted to
simplified models (density-density Coulomb interactions, high symmetry
couplings and few-band models). In this work we implement an efficient general
hybridization-expansion continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo impurity solver
(Krylov approach) which allows us to investigate orbital and spin ordering in a
more realistic setting, including interactions that are often neglected (e.g.,
spin-flip and pair-hopping terms), enlarged basis sets (full d versus eg),
low-symmetry distortions, and reaching the very low-temperature (experimental)
regime. We use this solver to study ordering phenomena in a selection of
exemplary low-symmetry transition-metal oxides: LaMnO3 and rare-earth
manganites as well as the perovskites CaVO3 and YTiO3. We show that spin-flip
and pair hopping terms do not affect the Kugel-Khomskii orbital-order melting
transition in rare-earth manganites, or the suppression of orbital fluctuations
driven by crystal field and Coulomb repulsion. For the Mott insulator YTiO3 we
find a ferromagnetic transition temperature 50 K, in remarkably good agreement
with experiments. For LaMnO3 we show that the classical t2g-spin approximation,
commonly adopted for studying manganites, yields indeed an occupied eg orbital
in very good agreement with that obtained for the full d 5-orbital Hubbard
model, while the spin-spin e_g-t_{2g} correlation function calculated from the
full d model is 0.74, very close to the value expected for aligned eg and t2g
spins; the eg spectral function matrix is also well reproduced. Finally, we
show that the t2g screening reduces the eg-eg Coulomb repulsion by about 10%

and Models for Robotic Systems (DSLRob'12), held at the 2012 International
Conference on Simulation, Modeling, and Programming for Autonomous Robots
(SIMPAR 2012), November 2012 in Tsukuba, Japan.
  The main topics of the workshop were Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) and
Model-driven Architecture (MDA) for robotics. A domain-specific language (DSL)
is a programming language dedicated to a particular problem domain that offers
specific notations and abstractions that increase programmer productivity
within that domain. Models-driven architecture (MDA) offers a high-level way
for domain users to specify the functionality of their system at the right
level of abstraction. DSLs and models have historically been used for
programming complex systems. However recently they have garnered interest as a
separate field of study. Robotic systems blend hardware and software in a
holistic way that intrinsically raises many crosscutting concerns (concurrency,
uncertainty, time constraints, ...), for which reason, traditional
general-purpose languages often lead to a poor fit between the language
features and the implementation requirements. DSLs and models offer a powerful,
systematic way to overcome this problem, enabling the programmer to quickly and
precisely implement novel software solutions to complex problems within the
robotics domain.

one-dimensional optical lattice after its sudden release from a harmonic trap.
Just after the trap has been removed, a linear ramp potential is applied,
mimicking the so called Galileo ramp experiment. The non-equilibrium expansion
of the bosonic cloud is elucidated through a hydrodynamical description which
is compared to the exact numerical evolution obtained by exact diagonalization
on finite lattice sizes. The system is found to exhibit a rich behavior showing
in particular Bloch oscillations of a self-trapped condensate and an ejected
particle density leading to two diverging entangled condensates. Depending on
the initial density of the gas different regimes of Josephson-like oscillations
are observed. At low densities, the trapped part of the cloud is in a
superfluid phase that oscillates in time as a whole. At higher densities, the
trapped condensate is in a mixed superfluid-Mott phase that show a breathing
regime for steep enough potential ramps.

0.1888%+/-0.0072% in the 3.6, 4.5, and 8.0 \mu m bands respectively. We compare
our measured secondary eclipse depths to the predictions from a one-dimensional
radiative transfer model, which suggests the possible presence of a transient
day side inversion in HAT-P-2b's atmosphere near periapse. We also derive
improved estimates for the system parameters, including its mass, radius, and
orbital ephemeris. Our simultaneous fit to the transit, secondary eclipse, and
radial velocity data allows us to determine the eccentricity and argument of
periapse of HAT-P-2b's orbit with a greater precision than has been achieved
for any other eccentric extrasolar planet. We also find evidence for a
long-term linear trend in the radial velocity data. This trend suggests the
presence of another substellar companion in the HAT-P-2 system, which could
have caused HAT-P-2b to migrate inward to its present-day orbit via the Kozai
mechanism.

in both the surface-brightness distribution and the flux spectrum. The spectral
features have been use previously to determine $\log_{10} (g)$, and now that
the luminosity and radius of a non-binary red giant or red supergiant can be
observed, spherical model stellar atmospheres can be used to determine the

variations with mass are slightly smaller than can be resolved by current

constitute examples of symmetry protected topological states in the absence of

of these non-magnetic bulk insulators is the protected metallic electronic
states confined to the material's surfaces. Electrons in these surface states
are spin polarized with their spins governed by their direction of travel
(linear momentum), resulting in a helical spin texture in momentum space. Spin-
and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (spin-ARPES) has been the only
tool capable of directly observing this central feature with simultaneous
energy, momentum, and spin sensitivity. By using an innovative photoelectron
spectrometer with a high-flux laser-based light source, we discovered another
surprising property of these surface electrons which behave like Dirac
fermions. We found that the spin polarization of the resulting photoelectrons
can be fully manipulated in all three dimensions through selection of the light
polarization. These surprising effects are due to the spin-dependent
interaction of the helical Dirac fermions with light, which originates from the
strong spin-orbit coupling in the material. Our results illustrate unusual
scenarios in which the spin polarization of photoelectrons is completely
different from the spin state of electrons in the originating initial states.
The results also provide the basis for a novel source of highly spin-polarized
electrons with tunable polarization in three dimensions.

conditions necessary for triggering this instability can be present already in
the color-glass-condensate initial state or dynamically generated by the rapid
longitudinal expansion of the matter created in a heavy-ion collision. Using
the hard-loop framework we study the case that the one-particle distribution
function possesses an arbitrary initial momentum anisotropy that increases in
time due to longitudinal free streaming. The resulting three-dimensional
dynamical equations for the chromofield evolution are solved numerically. We
find that there is regeneration of the longitudinal pressure due to unstable

this UV bright population to wide-field infrared surveys such as the near

of the UV luminous WiggleZ galaxies are detected at >5sigma in the UKIDSS-LAS

WISE 3.4 and 4.6um bands. We compute stellar masses for this very large sample

estimates to various assumptions made during the SED fitting. The median
stellar masses are log10(M*/M0)=9.6\pm0.7, 10.2\pm0.5 and 10.4\pm0.4 for the
IR-undetected, UKIDSS detected and UKIDSS+WISE detected galaxies respectively.
We demonstrate that the inclusion of NIR photometry can lead to tighter

sensitive to the inclusion of secondary bursts of star formation as well as
changes in the stellar population synthesis models, both of which can lead to
median discrepancies of the order of 0.3dex in the stellar masses. We find that
the best-fit M/LK is significantly lower (by ~0.4 dex) than that predicted by
simple optical colour based estimators, in particular for the bluer galaxies
with younger best-fit ages. The WiggleZ galaxies have star formation rates of
3-10 M0/yr and mostly lie at the upper end of the main sequence of star-forming
galaxies at these redshifts. Their rest-frame UV luminosities and stellar

First, we derive the zero temperature phase diagram of a clean Dirac fermion
system with tunable doping level ({\mu}) and attraction strength (g). We show
that it contains two phases: a superconductor and a Dirac semimetal. Then, we
show that arbitrarily weak disorder destroys the Dirac semimetal, turning it
into a superconductor. We discuss the strength of the superconductivity for
both long range and short range disorder. For long range disorder, the
superconductivity is exponentially weak in the disorder strength. For short
range disorder, a uniform mean field analysis predicts that superconductivity
should be doubly exponentially weak in the disorder strength. However, a more
careful treatment of mesoscopic fluctuations suggests that locally
superconducting puddles should form at a much higher temperature, and should
establish global phase coherence at a temperature that is only exponentially
small in weak disorder. We also discuss the effect of disorder on the quantum
critical point of the clean system, building in the effect of disorder through
a replica field theory. We show that disorder is a relevant perturbation to the
supersymmetric quantum critical point. We expect that in the presence of
attractive interactions, the flow away from the critical point ends up in the
superconducting phase, although firm conclusions cannot be drawn since the
renormalization group analysis flows to strong coupling. We argue that although
we expect the quantum critical point to get buried under a superconducting
phase, signatures of the critical point may be visible in the finite
temperature quantum critical regime.

a large scatter in scaling relations in low-mass or high-mass systems depending
on the size of cut. A velocity dispersion based virial radius can more
overestimate velocity dispersion in comparison to X-ray based virial radius for
low mass systems. There is no significant difference between these two radial
cuts for more massive systems. Independent of radial cut, overestimation of

number densities of quenched early-type galaxies (Q-ETGs) of a given size over
the interval 0.2 < z < 1.0 to study the claimed size evolution of these
galaxies. At 10^10.5<Mgalaxy<10^11 Msun, we see no change in the number density
of compact Q-ETGs, while at >10^11 Msun we find a decrease by 30%. In both mass
bins, the increase of the median sizes of Q-ETGs with time is primarily caused
by the addition to the size function of larger and more diffuse Q-ETGs. At all
masses, compact Q-ETGs become systematically redder towards later epochs, with
a (U-V) difference consistent with passive evolution of their stellar
populations, indicating that they are a population that does not appreciably
evolve in size. At all epochs, the larger Q-ETGs (at least in the lower mass
bin) have average rest-frame colors systematically bluer than those of the more
compact Q-ETGs, suggesting that the former are younger than the latter. The
idea that new, large, Q-ETGs are responsible for the observed growth in the
median size of the population at a given mass is supported by the sizes and
number of the star-forming galaxies that are expected to be progenitors of the
new Q-ETGs over the same period. In the low mass bin, the new Q-ETG have 30%
smaller sizes than their star-forming progenitors. This is likely due to the
fading of their disks after they cease star-formation. Comparison with higher z
shows that the median size of newly-quenched galaxies roughly scales, at
constant mass, as (1+z)^-1. The dominant cause of the size evolution seen in
the Q-ETG population is thus that the average sizes of individual Q-ETGs scale
with the average density of the Universe at the time when they were quenched,
with subsequent size changes in individual objects through eg merging of
secondary importance, especially at masses <10^11 Msun.

This fact poses the more general question of whether it is at all feasible that
the numerous genes that are coregulated on a given chromosome, especially those
at large genomic distances, might become proximate inside the nucleus. This
problem is studied here using steered molecular dynamics simulations in order
to enforce the colocalization of thousands of knowledge-based gene sequences on
a model for the gene-rich human chromosome 19. Remarkably, it is found that
most (~80%) gene pairs can be brought simultaneously into contact. This is made
possible by the low degree of intra-chromosome entanglement and the large
number of cliques in the gene coregulatory network, that is the many groups of
genes that are all mutually coregulated. The constrained conformations for the
model chromosome 19 are further shown to be organised in spatial macrodomains
that are similar to those inferred from recent HiC measurements. The findings
indicate that gene coregulation and colocalization are largely compatible and
that this relationship can be exploited to draft the overall spatial
organization of the chromosome in vivo. The more general validity and
implications of these findings could be investigated by applying to other

of password management schemes --- systematic strategies to help users create
and remember multiple passwords. In the same way that security proofs in
cryptography are based on complexity-theoretic assumptions (e.g., hardness of
factoring and discrete logarithm), we quantify usability by introducing
usability assumptions. In particular, password management relies on assumptions
about human memory, e.g., that a user who follows a particular rehearsal
schedule will successfully maintain the corresponding memory. These assumptions
are informed by research in cognitive science and validated through empirical
studies. Given rehearsal requirements and a user's visitation schedule for each
account, we use the total number of extra rehearsals that the user would have
to do to remember all of his passwords as a measure of the usability of the
password scheme. Our usability model leads us to a key observation: password
reuse benefits users not only by reducing the number of passwords that the user
has to memorize, but more importantly by increasing the natural rehearsal rate
for each password. We also present a security model which accounts for the
complexity of password management with multiple accounts and associated
threats, including online, offline, and plaintext password leak attacks.
Observing that current password management schemes are either insecure or
unusable, we present Shared Cues--- a new scheme in which the underlying secret
is strategically shared across accounts to ensure that most rehearsal
requirements are satisfied naturally while simultaneously providing strong
security. The construction uses the Chinese Remainder Theorem to achieve these

with ringlike shape are investigated. Similar to experimental self-assembled
quantum rings, the analyzed quantum dots have volcano-like shapes. The
continuum mechanical model is employed to determine the strain distribution,
and the single-band envelope function approach is adopted to compute the
electron states. The hole states are determined by the axially symmetric
multiband Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian, and the exciton states are obtained from
an exact diagonalization. We found that the presence of the inner layer
covering the ring opening enhances the excitonic Aharonov-Bohm (AB)
oscillations. The reason is that the hole becomes mainly localized in the inner
part of the quantum dot due to strain, whereas the electron resides mainly
inside the ring-shaped rim. Interestingly, larger AB oscillations are found in
the analyzed quantum dot than in a fully opened quantum ring of the same width.
Comparison with the unstrained ring-like quantum dot shows that the amplitude
of the excitonic Aharonov-Bohm oscillations are almost doubled in the presence
of strain. The computed oscillations of the exciton energy levels are
comparable in magnitude to the oscillations measured in recent experiments.

3.6um to 160um, as well as visible-wavelength HST images. We use the Spitzer
data to estimate dust masses, or establish upper limits, and find that all of
the ETGs with dust lanes in the HST data are detected in all of the Spitzer
bands and have dust masses of ~10^{5-6.5} Msun, while galaxies without dust
lanes are not detected at 70um and 160um and typically have <10^5 Msun of dust.
The apparently dust-free galaxies do have 24um emission that scales with the
shorter wavelength flux, yet substantially exceeds the expectations of
photospheric emission by approximately a factor of three. We conclude this
emission is dominated by hot, circumstellar dust around evolved stars that does
not survive to form a substantial interstellar component. The order of
magnitude variations in dust masses between galaxies with similar stellar
populations rules out a subtantial contribution from continual, internal
production in spite of the clear evidence for circumstellar dust. We
demonstrate that the interstellar dust is not due to purely external accretion,
unless the product of the merger rate of dusty satellites and the dust lifetime
is at least an order of magnitude higher than expected. We propose that dust in
ETGs is seeded by external accretion, yet the accreted dust is maintained by
continued growth in externally-accreted cold gas beyond the nominal lifetime of
individual grains. The several Gyr depletion time of the cold gas is long
enough to reconcile the fraction of dusty ETGs with the merger rate of gas-rich
satellites. As the majority of dusty ETGs are also low-luminosity AGN and
likely fueled by this cold gas, their lifetime should similarly be several Gyr.

probability distribution from data. Many techniques have been proposed to study
the structure of data, most often building around the assumption that
observations lie on a lower-dimensional manifold of high probability. It has
been more difficult, however, to exploit this insight to build explicit,
tractable density models for high-dimensional data. In this paper, we introduce
the deep density model (DDM), a new approach to density estimation. We exploit
insights from deep learning to construct a bijective map to a representation
space, under which the transformation of the distribution of the data is
approximately factorized and has identical and known marginal densities. The
simplicity of the latent distribution under the model allows us to feasibly
explore it, and the invertibility of the map to characterize contraction of
measure across it. This enables us to compute normalized densities for
out-of-sample data. This combination of tractability and flexibility allows us
to tackle a variety of probabilistic tasks on high-dimensional datasets,
including: rapid computation of normalized densities at test-time without
evaluating a partition function; generation of samples without MCMC; and
characterization of the joint entropy of the data.

in a non-equilibrium steady state. We use such a numerical laboratory to study
the appropriateness of the so-called first order (Chapman-Enskog) relativistic
hydrodynamics by calculating various transport coefficients. Our numerical
results are consistent with predictions of such a theory for a wide range of
temperatures. Our results are somewhat surprising since such linear theories
are not consistent with the fundamental assumption of the special theory of
relativity ($v\leq c$). We therefore seek to explain such results by studying
the appropriateness of diffusive transport in the relativistic gas, comparing
our results with that of a classical gas. We find that the relativistic
correction (constraint) in the hydrodynamic limit amounts to small negligible
corrections, thus indicating the validity of the linear approximation in near

altithorax and the better known African species B. brancai. However,
examination of the overlapping material shows 26 differences between the
species. B. brancai must be removed from Brachiosaurus and referred to the
genus Giraffatitan, which has been previously proposed for it.
  Xenoposeidon proneneukos is a new neosauropod from the Lower Cretaceous
Hastings Bed Group, known from a single partial dorsal vertebra. The excellent
preservation of the Xenoposeidon holotype reveals six unique characters. The
distinctive morphology suggests that Xenoposeidon may represent a new sauropod
family, extending sauropod disparity as well as bringing to four the number of
sauropod families known from the Wealden.
  A second new Early Cretaceous genus is also described, a titanosauriform from
the Ruby Ranch Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation, in Utah. This taxon is
known from at least two individuals, an adult and a juvenile, which together
provide vertebrae, ribs, a scapula, sternal plates and an ilium. The ilium is
particularly unusual, exhibiting five unique features.
  The longest sauropod necks were five times as long as those of the next
longest terrestrial animals, and four separate lineages evolved necks exceeding
10 m. Elongation was enabled by sheer size, vertebral pneumaticity and the
relative smallness of sauropod heads, despite aspects of cervical osteology
that are difficult to understand on mechanical first principles.

  Perspective",,,,,"cs.SI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The study of social networks is a burgeoning research area. However, most
existing work deals with networks that simply encode whether relationships
exist or not. In contrast, relationships in signed networks can be positive
(""like"", ""trust"") or negative (""dislike"", ""distrust""). The theory of social
balance shows that signed networks tend to conform to some local patterns that,
in turn, induce certain global characteristics. In this paper, we exploit both
local as well as global aspects of social balance theory for two fundamental
problems in the analysis of signed networks: sign prediction and clustering.
Motivated by local patterns of social balance, we first propose two families of
sign prediction methods: measures of social imbalance (MOIs), and supervised
learning using high order cycles (HOCs). These methods predict signs of edges
based on triangles and \ell-cycles for relatively small values of \ell.
Interestingly, by examining measures of social imbalance, we show that the
classic Katz measure, which is used widely in unsigned link prediction,
actually has a balance theoretic interpretation when applied to signed
networks. Furthermore, motivated by the global structure of balanced networks,
we propose an effective low rank modeling approach for both sign prediction and
clustering. For the low rank modeling approach, we provide theoretical
performance guarantees via convex relaxations, scale it up to large problem
sizes using a matrix factorization based algorithm, and provide extensive
experimental validation including comparisons with local approaches. Our
experimental results indicate that, by adopting a more global viewpoint of
balance structure, we get significant performance and computational gains in
prediction and clustering tasks on signed networks. Our work therefore
highlights the usefulness of the global aspect of balance theory for the
analysis of signed networks.

evolution of the oxygen vacancy distribution at different temperatures and
dopant concentrations in the presence or absence of an alternating external
field. We predict the characteristic time scale for the alignment of all defect
dipoles with the spontanenous polarization of the surrounding matrix. In this
state the defect dipoles act as obstacles for domain wall motion and contribute
to the experimentally observed aging. Under cycling conditions the fully
aligned configuration is perturbed and a dynamic equilibrium is established
with defect dipoles in parallel and anti-parallel orientation relative to the
spontaneous polarization. This process can be related to the deaging behavior
of piezoelectric ceramics.

This Green's function is a modified version of what Doi and Edwards first
derived to describe the polymer chain confined in the tube-like domain of
surrounding entangled polymers [J. Chem. Soc. Farad. Trans. II 74 (1978) 1802].
In contradiction to the results found by Ianniruberto and Marrucci (IM) when
applying the Doi-Edwards Green function [J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 79 (1998)
225], we find that the stress-optical rule is violated for any tube potential
either circular or elliptic if the corrected Green's function is used. The
violation is due to the presence of the virtual springs to confine the chain in
the tube rather than the anisotropy of the confinement potential. On the other
hand, Doi and Edwards used their Green's function only for estimation of the
monomer density along the primitive path where we find just a small correction.
Since they did not use it for rheological calculations, the stress-optic rule
appears to be safe for the Doi-Edwards model.

of the recently proposed two physically inequivalent gauge-invariant
decompositions of the nucleon spin. It is crucialy important to recognize the
fact that the standard gauge fixing procedure is essentially a process of
projecting out the physical components of the massless gauge field. A
complexity of the nonabelian gauge theory as compared with the abelian case is
that a closed expression for the physical component can be given only with use
of the non-local Wilson line, which is generally path-dependent. It is known
that, by choosing an infinitely long straight-line path in space and time, the
direction of which is characterized by a constant 4-vector $n^\mu$, one can
cover a class of gauge called the general axial gauge, containing three popular
gauges, i.e. the temporal, the light-cone, and the spatial axial gauge. Within
this general axial gauge, we have calculated the 1-loop evolution matrix for
the quark and gluon longitudinal spins in the nucleon. We found that the final
answer is exactly the same independently of the choices of $n^\mu$, which
amounts to proving the gauge-independence and path-independence simultaneously,
although within a restricted class of gauges and paths. By drawing on all of
these findings together with well-established knowledge from gauge theories, we
argue against the rapidly spreading view in the community that there are
infinitely many decompositions of the nucleon spin.

codes which controls this growth. They approximated each bit-channel with a
better channel and a worse channel while reducing the alphabet size. They
constructed a polar code based on the worse channel and used the better channel

presented using iterative upgrading of the bit-channels which successively
results in a channel closer to the original one. It is shown that this approach

access, thus gaining more and more interests in both the academia and the
industry. However, data replication introduces the problem of data consistency.
Modern commercial data replication systems often provide weak consistency for
high availability under certain failure scenarios. An important weak
consistency is Pipelined-RAM (PRAM) consistency. It allows different processes
to hold different views of data. To determine whether a data replication system
indeed provides PRAM consistency, we study the problem of Verifying PRAM
Consistency over read/write traces (or VPC, for short).
  We first identify four variants of VPC according to a) whether there are
Multiple shared variables (or one Single variable), and b) whether write
operations can assign Duplicate values (or only Unique values) for each shared
variable; the four variants are labeled VPC-SU, VPC-MU, VPC-SD, and VPC-MD.
Second, we present a simple VPC-MU algorithm, called RW-CLOSURE. It constructs
an operation graph $\mathcal{G}$ by iteratively adding edges according to three
rules. Its time complexity is $O(n^5)$, where n is the number of operations in
the trace. Third, we present an improved VPC-MU algorithm, called READ-CENTRIC,
with time complexity $O(n^4)$. Basically it attempts to construct the operation
graph $\mathcal{G}$ in an incremental and efficient way. Its correctness is
based on that of RW-CLOSURE. Finally, we prove that VPC-SD (so is VPC-MD) is

non-Gaussian features of concentric circles of low temperature variance.
Conformal cyclic cosmology (CCC) predicts such features from supermassive
black-hole encounters in an aeon preceding our Big Bang. The significance of
individual low-variance circles in the true data has been disputed; yet a
recent independent analysis has confirmed CCC's expectation that CMB circles
have a non-Gaussian temperature distribution. Here we examine concentric sets
of low-variance circular rings in the WMAP data, finding a highly non-isotropic
distribution. A new ""sky-twist"" procedure, directly analysing WMAP data,
without appeal to simulations, shows that the prevalence of these concentric
sets depends on the rings being circular, rather than even slightly elliptical,
numbers dropping off dramatically with increasing ellipticity. This is
consistent with CCC's expectations; so also is the crucial fact that whereas
some of the rings' radii are found to reach around $15^\circ$, none exceed
$20^\circ$. The non-isotropic distribution of the concentric sets may be linked
to previously known anomalous and non-Gaussian CMB features.

range of halo-mass catalogues with a number density comparable to the latest
large-volume galaxy surveys such as the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey and the

span halo masses with bias factors ranging from unity (probed by emission-line
galaxies) to more massive haloes hosting Luminous Red Galaxies. We show that
the measured growth rate is sensitive to the model adopted for the small-scale
real-space correlation function, and in particular that the ""standard""
assumption of a power-law correlation function can result in a significant
systematic error in the growth rate determination. We introduce a new,
empirical fitting function that produces results with a lower (5-10%) amplitude
of systematic error. We also introduce a new technique which permits the galaxy
pairwise velocity distribution, the quantity which drives the non-linear growth
of structure, to be measured as a non-parametric stepwise function. Our
(model-independent) results agree well with an exponential pairwise velocity
distribution, expected from theoretical considerations, and are consistent with

30 %. This level of departure from HSE is consistent with the previous claims,
but our physical interpretation is rather different. We demonstrate that the
inertial term in the Euler equations makes a negligible contribution to the
total mass, and the overall gravity of the cluster is balanced by the thermal
gas pressure gradient and the gas acceleration term. Indeed the deviation from
the HSE mass is well explained by the acceleration term at almost all radii. We
also clarify the confusion of previous work due to the inappropriate
application of the Jeans equations in considering the validity of HSE from the

the laws that controls the events at these scales. Further, it is supposed that
the time dependence of the entropy, which determine the direction of the time
arrow, originates at the same time scale and, thus, the nature of the time
arrow will be never established either. Finally, I conjecture that the brain

Since these problems are meta-heuristic, despite a lot of research, practically

method, which improves over the existing methods in every stage of the object

extract other features in a robust, computationally efficient, and less
meta-heuristic manner. We also propose a new hierarchical codebook, which
provides good generalization and discriminative properties. The codebook
enables fast multi-path inference mechanisms based on propagation of
conditional likelihoods, that make it robust to occlusion and noise. It has the
capability of dynamic learning. We also propose a new learning method that has
generative and discriminative learning capabilities, does not need large and
fully supervised training dataset, and is capable of online learning. The
preliminary work of detecting geometric shapes in real images has been
completed. This preliminary work is the focus of this report. Future path for

However, traditional erasure codes are inefficient on reading stored data in

to cope with distributed storage system nuances are vigorously being

this study to design CORE, a general storage primitive that we integrate into

the gains are respectively 15% and 60% for double node failures.

orbital cycle, accounting for the gravitational influence of the companion star
on the shape and physical properties of the stellar surface. Methods: We used
the Roche potential modified to account for radiation pressure to compute the
stellar surface of close circular systems and we used the TIDES code for
surface computation of eccentric systems. In both cases, we accounted for
gravity darkening and mutual heating generated by irradiation to compute the
surface temperature. We then interpolated NLTE plane-parallel atmosphere model
spectra in a grid to obtain the local spectrum at each surface point. We
finally summed all contributions, accounting for the Doppler shift,
limb-darkening, and visibility to obtain the total synthetic spectrum. We
computed different orbital phases and sets of physical and orbital parameters.
Results: Our models predict line strength variations through the orbital cycle,
but fail to completely reproduce the Struve-Sahade effect. Including radiation
pressure allows us to reproduce a surface temperature distribution that is
consistent with observations of semi-detached binary systems. Conclusions:
Radiation pressure effects on the stellar surface are weak in (over)contact
binaries and well-detached systems but can become very significant in
semi-detached systems. The classical von Zeipel theorem is sufficient for the
spectral computation. Broad-band light curves derived from the spectral
computation are different from those computed with a model in which the stellar
surfaces are equipotentials of the Roche potential scaled by the instantaneous
orbital separation. In many cases, the fit of two Gaussian/Lorentzian profiles
fails to properly measure the equivalent width of the lines and leads to
apparent variations that could explain some of the effects reported in the
literature.

memory, with which future information can help sharpen the inference about the
current state. By providing theoretical justification of several existing
algorithms and introducing several new ones, we study systematically how to
construct efficient SMC algorithms to take advantage of the ""future""
information without creating a substantially high computational burden. The
main idea is to allow for lookahead in the Monte Carlo process so that future
information can be utilized in weighting and generating Monte Carlo samples, or
resampling from samples of the current state.

are reported in this study. The chains were obtained by unraveling carbon atoms
from graphene ribbons while an electrical current flowed through the ribbon
and, successively, through the chain. The formation of the chains was
accompanied by a characteristic drop in the electrical conductivity. The
conductivity of carbon chains was much lower than previously predicted for
ideal chains. First-principles calculations using both density functional and
many-body perturbation theory show that strain in the chains determines the
conductivity in a decisive way. Indeed, carbon chains are always under varying
non-zero strain that transforms its atomic structure from cumulene to polyyne
configuration, thus inducing a tunable band gap. The modified electronic
structure and the characteristics of the contact to the graphitic periphery
explain the low conductivity of the locally constrained carbon chain.

with the HERschel Multi tiered Extragalactic Survey (HerMES) data at 250, 350

total infrared (IR) luminosity functions (LFs) up to z~4. We detect very strong
luminosity evolution for the total IR LF combined with a density evolution. In
agreement with previous findings, the IR luminosity density increases steeply
to z~1, then flattens between z~1 and z~3 to decrease at z greater than 3.
Galaxies with different SEDs, masses and sSFRs evolve in very different ways
and this large and deep statistical sample is the first one allowing us to
separately study the different evolutionary behaviours of the individual IR
populations contributing to the IR luminosity density. Galaxies occupying the
well established SFR/stellar mass main sequence (MS) are found to dominate both
the total IR LF and luminosity density at all redshifts, with the contribution
from off MS sources (0.6 dex above MS) being nearly constant (~20% of the total
IR luminosity density) and showing no significant signs of increase with
increasing z over the whole 0.8<z<2.2 range. Sources with mass in the 10<
log(M/Msun) <11 range are found to dominate the total IR LF, with more massive
galaxies prevailing at the bright end of the high-z LF. A two-fold evolutionary
scheme for IR galaxies is envisaged: on the one hand, a starburst-dominated
phase in which the SMBH grows and is obscured by dust, is followed by an AGN
dominated phase, then evolving toward a local elliptical. On the other hand,
moderately starforming galaxies containing a low-luminosity AGN have various
properties suggesting they are good candidates for systems in a transition
phase preceding the formation of steady spiral galaxies.

number of such chains is minimized by taking sets as close to the middle level

k-chains, for all k. In this paper, making the first progress on this problem,
we verify Kleitman's conjecture for the families whose size is at most the size
of the $k+1$ middle levels. We also characterize all extremal configurations.

networks, Cayley trees and Vicsek fractals, which separately model dendrimers
and regular hyperbranched polymers. Our goal is to explore the impact of trap
location on the efficiency of trapping in these two important polymer systems,
with the efficiency being measured by the average trapping time (ATT) that is
the average of source-to-trap mean first-passage time over every staring point
in the whole networks. For Cayley trees, we derive an exact analytic formula
for the ATT to an arbitrary trap node, based on which we further obtain the
explicit expression of ATT for the case that the trap is uniformly distributed.
For Vicsek fractals, we provide the closed-form solution for ATT to a
peripheral node farthest from the central node, as well as the numerical
solutions for the case when the trap is placed on other nodes. Moreover, we
derive the exact formula for the ATT corresponding to the trapping problem when
the trap has an uniform distribution over all nodes. Our results show that the
influence of trap location on the trapping efficiency is completely different
for the two polymer networks. In Cayley trees, the leading scaling of ATT
increases with the shortest distance between the trap and the central node,
implying that trap's position has an essential impact on the trapping
efficiency; while in Vicsek fractals, the effect of location of the trap is
negligible, since the dominant behavior of ATT is identical, respective of the
location where the trap is placed. We also present that for all cases of
trapping problems being studied, the trapping process is more efficient in
Cayley trees than in Vicsek fractals. We demonstrate that all differences
related to trapping in the two polymer systems are rooted in their underlying
topological structures.

BPS black hole solutions. As in the Euclidean case, preserved supersymmetry for
asymptotically locally AdS solutions implies the existence of a (charged)
""conformal Killing spinor"" on the boundary. We find that such spinors exist
whenever there is a conformal Killing vector which is null or timelike. We
match these results with expectations from supersymmetric four-dimensional
asymptotically AdS black holes. In particular, BPS bulk solutions in global AdS
are known to fall in two classes, depending on their graviphoton magnetic
charge, and we reproduce this dichotomy from the boundary perspective. We
finish by sketching a proposal to find the dual superconformal quantum
mechanics on the horizon of the magnetic black holes.

non-equilibrium state can appear at much higher temperatures than in an
equilibrium state. However, any system is subject to the natural relaxation
process establishing equilibrium. The work deals with the numerical study of
entanglement dynamics in a dipolar coupled spin-1/2 system under the transition
from a non-equilibrium state to an equilibrium state. The spin system is
characterized by a two-temperature density matrix, and the process of the
establishment of equilibrium is in the equalization of these temperatures. The
method of the non-equilibrium statistical operator is used to describe the
evolution of the system. The process of establishing an equilibrium state in
the homonuclear spin systems at low temperature was first considered. It was
shown that the time dependences of the inverse temperatures of the spin
subsystems are given by a solution of non-linear equations in contrast to the
linear equations in the well-known high temperature approximation. It was first
studied the entanglement dynamics during the equilibrium state establishment
and found that, during establishing equilibrium, the concurrence changes
non-monotonically with time and temperatures. Entanglement fades long before
equilibrium is established in the system. It was shown that the entanglement
dynamics depends strongly on the ratio of the Zeeman energy to the dipolar
energy. At a high ratio, the concurrence in the system decreases quickly for
time about 100 {\mu}s while, at a low ratio, establishment of equilibrium and
fading entanglement take prolonged time up to 1 ms.

when the goal is the quantification of a relationship between two variables,
not simply the establishment of its existence. Much of the literature on
dependence measures is focused, at least implicitly, on detection or revolves
around the inclusion/exclusion of particular axioms and discussing which
measures satisfy said axioms. In contrast, we start with only a few
nonrestrictive guidelines focused on existence, range and interpretability,
which provide a very open and flexible framework. For quantification, the most
crucial is the notion of interpretability, whose foundation can be found in the
work of Goodman and Kruskal [Measures of Association for Cross Classifications
(1979) Springer], and whose importance can be seen in the popularity of tools
such as the $R^2$ in linear regression. While Goodman and Kruskal focused on
probabilistic interpretations for their measures, we demonstrate how more
general measures of information can be used to achieve the same goal. To that
end, we present a strategy for building dependence measures that is designed to
allow practitioners to tailor measures to their needs. We demonstrate how many
well-known measures fit in with our framework and conclude the paper by
presenting two real data examples. Our first example explores U.S. income and
education where we demonstrate how this methodology can help guide the
selection and development of a dependence measure. Our second example examines
measures of dependence for functional data, and illustrates them using data on

large scale and it becomes essential to provide means to analyse this
phenomenon. In this paper we address the issue of predicting the temporal
dynamics of the information diffusion process. We develop a graph-based
approach built on the assumption that the macroscopic dynamics of the spreading
process are explained by the topology of the network and the interactions that
occur through it, between pairs of users, on the basis of properties at the
microscopic level. We introduce a generic model, called T-BaSIC, and describe
how to estimate its parameters from users behaviours using machine learning
techniques. Contrary to classical approaches where the parameters are fixed in
advance, T-BaSIC's parameters are functions depending of time, which permit to
better approximate and adapt to the diffusion phenomenon observed in online
social networks. Our proposal has been validated on real Twitter datasets.
Experiments show that our approach is able to capture the particular patterns
of diffusion depending of the studied sub-networks of users and topics. The
results corroborate the ""two-step"" theory (1955) that states that information
flows from media to a few ""opinion leaders"" who then transfer it to the mass
population via social networks and show that it applies in the online context.
This work also highlights interesting recommendations for future
investigations.

fascinating property of spin-momentum locking. In a Rashba system the inversion
symmetry normal to the plane of a two-dimensional (2D) electron gas is broken,
generating a Fermi surface spin texture reminiscent of spin vortices of
different radii. This can be exploited in a spin-based field-effect transistor
(spin- FET), where the Rashba system forms a 2D channel between ferromagnetic
(FM) source and drain electrodes. The electron spin precesses when propagating
through the Rashba channel and spin orientations (anti)parallel to the drain
give (low) high conductivity. Crucial is the possibility to tune the momentum
splitting, and consequently the precession angle, through an external

correlation functions involving local fields at positive flow times can be
established using a representation through a local field theory in 4+1
dimensions. Applications of the extended flow in lattice QCD include
non-perturbative renormalization and O(a) improvement as well as accurate
calculations of the chiral condensate and of the pseudo-scalar decay constant
in the chiral limit.

ever-increasing number of multiple-planet systems are being announced. But how
many of these systems are truly what they seem? In many cases, such systems are
announced solely on the basis of orbital fits to observational data, and no
attempt is made to see whether the proposed orbits are actually dynamically
feasible. As a result, it is certain that planetary systems are being announced
that involve planets moving on orbits that would be dynamically unstable on
timescales of just a few hundred years.
  Here, we present the results of dynamical simulations that investigate the
orbital stability and evolution of a number of recently discovered exoplanetary
systems. These simulations have enabled us to create highly detailed dynamical
maps of those systems, allowing us to better constrain the orbits of the
planets contained therein. In some cases, our results have even led to the very
existence of the planets themselves being called into question.

investigated in the framework of WKB theory discovering interesting interplay
with the Hawking radiation. A more precise and general account of that
phenomenon has been subsequently given within the framework of QFT in curved
spacetime by two of the authors of the present paper. In particular, it has
been shown that, in the limit of sharp localization on opposite sides of a
Killing horizon, the quantum correlation functions of a scalar field appear to
have thermal nature, and the tunnelling probability is proportional to
$\exp\{-\beta_{Hawking} E\}$. This local result is valid in every spacetime
including a local Killing horizon, no field equation is necessary, while a
suitable choice for the quantum state is relevant. Indeed, the two point
function has to verify a short-distance condition weaker than the Hadamard one.
In this paper we consider a massive scalar quantum field with a $\phi^3$
self-interaction and we investigate the issue whether or not the black hole
radiation can be handled at perturbative level, including the renormalisation
contributions. We prove that, for the simplest model of the Killing horizon
generated by the boost in Minkowski spacetime, and referring to Minkowski
vacuum, the tunnelling probability in the limit of sharp localization on
opposite sides of the horizon preserves the thermal form proportional to
$\exp\{-\beta_H E\}$ even taking the one-loop renormalisation corrections into
account. A similar result is expected to hold for the Unruh state in the
Kruskal manifold, since that state is Hadamard and looks like Minkowski vacuum
close to the horizon.

are good candidates to form part of a library of formulae. Same as libraries of

problem and therefore fix the electroweak (EW) scale in the presence of quantum
corrections. Numerical methods testing the SUSY models often report a good
likelihood L (or chi^2=-2ln L) to fit the data {\it including} the EW scale
itself (m_Z^0) with a {\it simultaneously} large fine-tuning i.e. a large
variation of this scale under a small variation of the SUSY parameters. We
argue that this is inconsistent and we identify the origin of this problem. Our
claim is that the likelihood (or chi^2) to fit the data that is usually
reported in such models does not account for the chi^2 cost of fixing the EW
scale. When this constraint is implemented, the likelihood (or chi^2) receives
a significant correction (delta_chi^2) that worsens the current data fits of
SUSY models. We estimate this correction for the models: constrained MSSM
(CMSSM), models with non-universal gaugino masses (NUGM) or higgs soft masses
(NUHM1, NUHM2), the NMSSM and the general NMSSM (GNMSSM). For a higgs mass
m_h\approx 126 GeV, one finds that in these models (delta_chi^2)/ndf> 1.5
(approx 1 for GNMSSM), which violates the usual condition of a good fit (total
chi^2/ndf approx 1) already before fitting observables other than the EW scale
itself (ndf=number of degrees of freedom). This has (negative) implications for
SUSY models and it is suggested that future data fits properly account for this
effect, if one remains true to the original goal of SUSY. Since the expression
of delta_chi^2 that emerges from our calculation depends on a familiar measure
of fine-tuning, one concludes that EW fine-tuning is an intrinsic part of the
likelihood to fit the data that includes the EW scale (m_Z^0).

antidot and along the edges of the bar are tunnel coupled. The close connection
between spin and chirality, typical of helical systems, allows to generate a
spin-polarized current flowing across the bar. This current is studied as a
function of the external voltages, by varying the asymmetry between the
barriers. For asymmetric setups, a switching behavior of the spin current is
observed as the bias is increased, both in the absence and in the presence of
electron interactions. This device allows to generate and control the
spin-polarized current by simple electrical means.

in practical applications has been severely hampered due to the breakdown of
their magnetotransport properties at temperatures well below their magnetic
transition temperature. This breakdown has been usually associated to surface
and interface related problems but its physical origin has not been clearly
established yet. In this work we investigate the interface between
La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 (LSMO) thin films and different capping layers by means of x-ray
linear dichroism and transport measurements. Our data reveal that, irrespective
to the capping material, LSMO/capping layer bilayers exhibit an
antiferromegnetic/insulating phase at the interface, likely to originate from a
preferential occupancy of Mn 3d 3z2-r2 eg orbitals. This phase, which extends
ca. 2 unit cells, is also observed in an uncapped LSMO reference sample thus,
pointing to an intrinsic interfacial phase separation phenomenon, likely to be
promoted by the structural disruption and symmetry breaking at the LSMO free
surface/interface. These experimental observations strongly suggest that the
structural disruption at the LSMO interfaces play a major role on the observed
depressed magnetotransport properties in manganite-based magnetic tunneling
junctions and it is at the origin of the so-called dead layer.

procedure could later be interpreted as adding an anti-D4(M5)-brane to the
prime N=6 membrane theory resulting in a N=0 antimembrane theory while other
symmetries are preserved. Then, according to the well-known state-operator
correspondence rules, we find a proper dual operator with the conformal
dimension of {\Delta}=3 that matches to the bulk massless pseudoscalar state.

reduce, the dark matter density and they modify in a significant way the viable

density constraint for dark matter masses well below 500 GeV. The dependence of
the relic density on the relevant parameters of the model, such as the dark
matter mass, the mass splitting, and the number of coannihilating fermions, is
analyzed in detail. We also investigate, via a scan over the parameter space,
the new viable regions that are obtained when coannihilations are taken into
account. Notably, they feature large indirect detection rates, with sigmav
reaching values of order 10^{-24} cm^3/s. Finally, we emphasize that

induce a bias and a dispersion of the Hubble diagram. This is investigated by
considering a Swiss-cheese cosmological model, which (1) is an exact solution
of the Einstein field equations, (2) is strongly inhomogeneous on small scales,
but (3) has the same expansion history as a strictly homogeneous and isotropic
universe. By simulating Hubble diagrams in such models, we quantify the
influence of inhomogeneities on the measurement of the cosmological parameters.
Though significant in general, the effects reduce drastically for a universe
dominated by the cosmological constant.

Focusing on the case of double U(1) gauge fields, we systematically investigate

nontrivial power law behavior in the electric AC conductivity when the

formation rates (SFRs) and stellar mass (M*) over the last ~10 Gyrs,
particularly focusing on its environmental dependence. We first present the
mid-infrared (MIR) properties of the H-alpha-selected galaxies in a rich
cluster Cl0939+4713 at z=0.4. With a MIR stacking analysis, we find that the
median SFR of H-alpha emitters is higher in higher-density environment at
z=0.4. We also find that star-forming galaxies in high-density environment tend
to have higher specific SFR (SSFR), although the trend is much less significant
compared to that of SFR. This increase of SSFR in high-density environment is
not visible when we consider the SFR derived from H-alpha alone, suggesting
that the dust attenuation in galaxies depends on environment; galaxies in
high-density environment tend to be dustier (by up to ~0.5 mag). We then
discuss the environmental dependence of the SFR-M* relation for star-forming
galaxies since z~2, by compiling our comparable, narrow-band selected, large
H-alpha emitter samples in both distant cluster environments (from
MAHALO-Subaru) and field environments (from HiZELS). We find that the SSFR of
H-alpha-selected galaxies (at the fixed mass of log(M*/Msun)=10) rapidly
evolves as (1+z)^3, but the SFR-M* relation is independent of the environment
since z~2, as far as we rely on the H-alpha-based SFRs (with M*-dependent
extinction correction). Even if we consider the possible environmental
variation in the dust attenuation, we conclude that the difference in the
SFR-M* relation between cluster and field star-forming galaxies is always small
(~<0.2dex level) at any time in the history of the Universe since z~2.

$-h^2\Delta+V$ (on $\mathbb{R}^n$ or on a Riemannian manifold) it is possible
to detect critical levels of the potential $V$. Via micro-local methods one can
express spectral statistics in terms of different invariants: \begin{itemize}
\item Geometry of energy surfaces (heat invariant like). \item Classical orbits
(wave invariants). \item But also classical equilibria (new wave invariants).
\end{itemize} Any critical point of $V$ with zero momentum is an equilibrium of
the flow and generates many singularities in the semi-classical distribution of
eigenvalues. Via sharp spectral estimates, this phenomena indicates the
presence of a critical energy level and the information contained in this
singularity allows to reconstruct partially the local shape of $V$. Several

propose and analyze a new interpretation of the wave-particle duality, and
propose a new rule that relates the corpuscular and wave properties of quantum

about quantum particles as temporary objects that are born permanently in a
wave field and spontaneously decayed due to their ""instability"". Thus, we fill
with the physical meaning the standard notions of ""creation"" and ""annihilation""

traditional probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics in the form of
the Born's rule is an approximate consequence of the proposed theory. The
proposed theory allows explaining the indistinguishability of quantum particles
and shows meaninglessness of the concept of their trajectories. We give an
explanation of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle within the limits of this
theory in terms of classical physics that allows us to return to an objective
understanding of the measurement process and do not consider it as a compulsory

waveform cross correlation requires a uniform coverage of the globe with master
events well recorded at array stations of the International Monitoring System.
The essence of cross correlation as a monitoring tool consists in a continuous
comparison of digital waveforms at a given station with waveform templates from
the global set of master events. At array stations, cross correlation
demonstrates a higher resolution because the time delays at individual sensors
from master and slave events are the same but they may differ from theoretical
ones used in standard beamforming. In the regions where master events and thus
waveform templates are available, one can reduce the amplitude threshold of
signal detection by a factor of 2 to 3 relative to standard beamforming and
STA/LTA detector used at the International Data Centre. The gain in sensitivity
corresponds to a body wave magnitude reduction by 0.3 to 0.4 units and doubles
the number of detected events. This gain is crucial for seismic monitoring
under the CTBT. The coverage by real master events is sparse and confined to
areas with historical seismicity, however. In two parts of this study, we
investigate the possibility to populate the global grid with real and synthetic
master events. In Part I, we replicate a high-quality master event over a
regular grid several hundred kilometers from its actual position. In Part II,
we model waveform templates using synthetic seismograms with the aim to apply
them in aseismic zones. Both approaches are tested using the aftershock
sequence of the April 11, 2012 Sumatera earthquake (Ms(IDC)=8.2). We used
sixteen master events to recover the aftershocks in the Reviewed Event Bulletin
of the IDC.

plays a role in determining measurement outcome and could therefore serve as a
""hidden"" variable. The Born rule for measurement equates the probability for a
given outcome with the absolute square of the coefficient of the basis state,
which by design removes the relative phase from the formulation. The value of
this phase at the moment of measurement naturally averages out in an ensemble,
which would prevent any dependence from being observed, and we show that
conventional frequency-spectroscopy measurements on discrete quantum systems
cannot be imposed at a specific phase due to a straightforward uncertainty
relation. We lay out general conditions for imposing measurements at a specific
value of the relative phase so that the possibility of its role as a hidden
variable can be tested, and we discuss implementation for the specific case of
an atomic two-state system with laser-induced fluorescence for measurement.

expansions during long-lasting intervals of quasi-radial interplanetary
magnetic field (IMF) and nearly constant solar wind dynamic pressure. The
expansions were global: the magnetopause was located more than 3 RE and ~7 RE
outside its nominal dayside and magnetotail locations, respectively. The
expanded states persisted several hours, just as long as the quasi-radial IMF
conditions, indicating steady-state situations. For an observed solar wind
pressure of ~1.1-1.3 nPa, the new equilibrium subsolar MP position lay at ~14.5
RE, far beyond its expected location. The equilibrium position was affected by
geomagnetic activity. The magnetopause expansions result from significant
decreases in the total pressure of the high-beta magnetosheath, which we term
the low-pressure magnetosheath (LPM) mode. A prominent LPM mode was observed
for upstream conditions characterized by IMF cone angles less than 20 ~ 25
grad, high Mach numbers and proton plasma beta<1.3. The minimum value for the
total pressure observed by THEMIS in the magnetosheath adjacent to the
magnetopause was 0.16 nPa and the fraction of the solar wind pressure applied
to the magnetopause was therefore 0.2, extremely small. The equilibrium
location of the magnetopause was modulated by a nearly continuous wavy motion
over a wide range of time and space scales.

be found, some amount of communication needs to take place between the players.
We are interested in algorithms where the communication is substantially less
than the contents of a payoff matrix, for example logarithmic in the size of
the matrix. When the communication is polylogarithmic in the number of
strategies n, we show how to obtain epsilon-approximate Nash equilibria for
epsilon approximately 0.438, and for well-supported approximate equilibria we
obtain epsilon approximately 0.732. For one-way communication we show that
epsilon=1/2 is achievable, but no constant improvement over 1/2 is possible,
even with unlimited one-way communication. For well-supported equilibria, no
value of epsilon less than 1 is achievable with one-way communication. When the
players do not communicate at all, epsilon-Nash equilibria can be obtained for

calculating only soft 1-loop diagrams with effective lines and vertices. It is
of interest to know if the photon self-energy is the only exception to this

refined power-counting analysis using real-time finite temperature field theory
which is particularly well suited to the task. We show that the standard
power-counting rules obtained from the imaginary time formalism usually
over-estimate the size of the 2-loop diagrams. We argue that the only

variety of self-organized spatial patterns. As particles exhibit an
increasingly higher tendency to align to neighbors, they first self-segregate
into disordered particle aggregates. Aggregates turn into traffic jams. Traffic
jams evolve toward gliders, triangular high density regions that migrate in a
well-defined direction. Maximum order is achieved by the formation of elongated
high density regions - bands - that transverse the entire system. Numerical
evidence suggests that below the percolation density the phase transition
associated to orientational order is of first-order, while at full occupancy it
is of second-order. The model highlights the (pattern formation) importance of
a coupling between local density, orientation, and local speed.

present the correlator previously used split into its two component parts to
reveal correlations parallel and perpendicular to the event plane. The results

approach in which each observation can be a linear combination of samples from
multiple sequences. The test has two stages. In the first stage, namely
scanning stage, one takes a linear combination of a pair of sequences with the
hope of scanning through sequences that are unlikely to be generated from $F_1$
and quickly identifying a pair of sequences such that at least one of them is
highly likely to be generated by $F_1$. In the second stage, namely refinement
stage, one examines the pair identified from the first stage more closely and
picks one sequence to be the final sequence. The problem under this setup
belongs to a class of multiple stopping time problems. In particular, it is an
ordered two concatenated Markov stopping time problem. We obtain the optimal

in large scale networks. This method is appreciated for its simplicity,
robustness, and efficiency. In the ""push"" protocol, every informed node
selects, at every time step (a.k.a. round), one of its neighboring node
uniformly at random and forwards the information to this node. This protocol is
known to complete information spreading in $O(\log n)$ time steps with high
probability (w.h.p.) in several families of $n$-node ""static"" networks. The
Push protocol has also been empirically shown to perform well in practice, and,
specifically, to be robust against dynamic topological changes.
  In this paper, we aim at analyzing the Push protocol in ""dynamic"" networks.
We consider the ""edge-Markovian"" evolving graph model which captures natural
temporal dependencies between the structure of the network at time $t$, and the
one at time $t+1$. Precisely, a non-edge appears with probability $p$, while an
existing edge dies with probability $q$. In order to fit with real-world
traces, we mostly concentrate our study on the case where $p=\Omega(1/n)$ and
$q$ is constant. We prove that, in this realistic scenario, the Push protocol
does perform well, completing information spreading in $O(\log n)$ time steps
w.h.p. Note that this performance holds even when the network is, w.h.p.,
disconnected at every time step (e.g., when $p << (\log n) / n$). Our result
provides the first formal argument demonstrating the robustness of the Push
protocol against network changes. We also address other ranges of parameters
$p$ and $q$ (e.g., $p+q=1$ with arbitrary $p$ and $q$, and $p=1/n$ with
arbitrary $q$). Although they do not precisely fit with the measures performed
on real-world traces, they can be of independent interest for other settings.
The results in these cases confirm the positive impact of dynamism.

particular, a wireless sensor powered by renewable energy takes observations
from a random sequence, whose distribution will change at a certain unknown
time. Such a change implies events of interest. The energy in the sensor is
consumed by taking observations and is replenished randomly. The sensor cannot
take observations if there is no energy left in the battery. Our goal is to
design a power allocation scheme and a detection strategy to minimize the worst
case detection delay, which is the difference between the time when an alarm is
raised and the time when the change occurs. Two types of average run length
(ARL) constraint, namely an algorithm level ARL constraint and an system level
ARL constraint, are considered. We propose a low complexity scheme in which the
energy allocation rule is to spend energy to take observations as long as the

show that this scheme is optimal for the formulation with the algorithm level

infinite word $x\in A^\mathbb{N}$, with values in a finite set $A$, is said to
be $k$-self-shuffling $(k\geq 2)$ if $x$ admits factorizations:
$x=\prod_{i=0}^\infty U_i^{(1)}\cdots U_i^{(k)}=\prod_{i=0}^\infty
U_i^{(1)}=\cdots =\prod_{i=0}^\infty U_i^{(k)}$. In other words, there exists a
shuffle of $k$-copies of $x$ which produces $x$. We are particularly interested
in the case $k=2$, in which case we say $x$ is self-shuffling. This property of
infinite words is shown to be an intrinsic property of the word and not of its
language (set of factors). For instance, every aperiodic word contains a non
self-shuffling word in its shift orbit closure. While the property of being
self-shuffling is a relatively strong condition, many important words arising
in the area of symbolic dynamics are verified to be self-shuffling. They
include for instance the Thue-Morse word and all Sturmian words of intercept
$0<\rho <1$ (while those of intercept $\rho=0$ are not self-shuffling). Our
characterization of self-shuffling Sturmian words can be interpreted
arithmetically in terms of a dynamical embedding and defines an arithmetic
process we call the {\it stepping stone model}. One important feature of
self-shuffling words stems from its morphic invariance, which provides a useful
tool for showing that one word is not the morphic image of another. The notion
of self-shuffling has other unexpected applications particularly in the area of
substitutive dynamical systems. For example, as a consequence of our
characterization of self-shuffling Sturmian words, we recover a number
theoretic result, originally due to Yasutomi, on a classification of pure
morphic Sturmian words in the orbit of the characteristic.

outside the microscopic domain, while quantum structures satisfactorily model
various situations in several areas of science, including biological, cognitive
and social processes. In this paper, we elaborate a quantum mechanical model
which faithfully describes the 'Ellsberg paradox' in economics, showing that
the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics is capable to represent the
'ambiguity' present in this kind of situations, because of the presence of
'contextuality'. Then, we analyze the data collected in a concrete experiment
we performed on the Ellsberg paradox and work out a complete representation of
them in complex Hilbert space. We prove that the presence of quantum structure
is genuine, that is, 'interference' and 'superposition' in a complex Hilbert
space are really necessary to describe the conceptual situation presented by
Ellsberg. Moreover, our approach sheds light on 'ambiguity laden' decision
processes in economics and decision theory, and allows to deal with different
Ellsberg-type generalizations, e.g., the 'Machina paradox'.

explore these results. With this in mind, we study the NIR spectra of a sample
of 23 HII and starburst galaxies, aimed at characterizing the most prominent
spectral features and continuum shape in the 0.8-2.4 micron region of these
objects. Spectral indices are derived for the relevant absorption lines/bands
and a comparison with optical indices of the same sample available in the
literature is made. We found no correlation between the optical and the NIR
indexes. This is probably due to the differences in aperture between these two
sets of data. That result is further supported by the absence or weakness of
emission lines in the NIR for a subsample galaxies, while in the optical the
emission lines are strong and clear, which means that the ionisation source in
many of these galaxies is not nuclear, but circumnuclear or located in hot
spots. We detected important signatures predicted for a stellar population
dominated by the TP-AGBs, like CN 1.1 micron and CO 2.3 micron. In at least one
galaxy (NGC 4102) the CN band at 1.4 micron was detected for the first time. We
also detect TiO and ZrO bands that have never been reported before in
extragalactic sources. The shape of the continuum emission is found to be
strongly correlated to the presence/lack of emission lines. An observational
template for the star-forming galaxies is derived to be used as a benchmark of
stellar population(s) in starburst galaxies against which to compare near-IR

  In this paper, we propose a novel computational approach, QUIRE, to identify
discriminative complex interactions among informative gene features for cancer

relevant feature groups for the disease and, then explores the search space
capturing the combinatorial relationships among the genes from the selected
informative groups. Using QUIRE, we explore the differential patterns and the
interactions among informative gene features in three different types of
cancers, Renal Cell Carcinoma(RCC), Ovarian Cancer(OVC) and Colorectal Cancer

interactions that can better identify the different cancer stages of samples
and can predict CRC recurrence and death from CRC more successfully, as
compared to other state-of-the-art feature selection methods. A literature
survey shows that many of the interactions identified by QUIRE play important
roles in the development of cancer.

Multi-Target Localization With Noisy Sensors' accepted to the 2013 IEEE

  This paper addresses the task of searching for an unknown number of static
targets within a known obstacle map using a team of mobile robots equipped with
noisy, limited field-of-view sensors. Such sensors may fail to detect a subset
of the visible targets or return false positive detections. These measurement
sets are used to localize the targets using the Probability Hypothesis Density,
or PHD, filter. Robots communicate with each other on a local peer-to-peer
basis and with a server or the cloud via access points, exchanging measurements
and poses to update their belief about the targets and plan future actions. The
server provides a mechanism to collect and synthesize information from all
robots and to share the global, albeit time-delayed, belief state to robots
near access points. We design a decentralized control scheme that exploits this
communication architecture and the PHD representation of the belief state.
Specifically, robots move to maximize mutual information between the target set
and measurements, both self-collected and those available by accessing the
server, balancing local exploration with sharing knowledge across the team.
Furthermore, robots coordinate their actions with other robots exploring the
same local region of the environment.

SOFIA-FORCAST. The high surface density of the natal core around the protostar
leads to high extinction, even at these relatively long wavelengths, causing
the observed flux to be dominated by that emerging from the near-facing outflow
cavity. However, emission from the far-facing cavity is still clearly detected.
We combine these results with fluxes from the near-infrared to mm to construct
a spectral energy distribution (SED). For isotropic emission the bolometric
luminosity would be 3.3x10^4 Lsun. We perform radiative transfer modeling of a
protostar forming by ordered, symmetric collapse from a massive core bounded by
a clump with high mass surface density, Sigma_cl. To fit the SED requires
protostellar masses ~20-34 Msun depending on the outflow cavity opening angle
(35 - 50 degrees), and Sigma_cl ~ 0.4-1 g cm-2. After accounting for the
foreground extinction and the flashlight effect, the true bolometric luminosity
is ~ (0.7-2.2)x10^5 Lsun. One of these models also has excellent agreement with
the observed intensity profiles along the outflow axis at 10, 18, 31 and 37
microns. Overall our results support a model of massive star formation
involving the relatively ordered, symmetric collapse of a massive, dense core
and the launching bipolar outflows that clear low density cavities. Thus a
unified model may apply for the formation of both low and high mass stars.

that is a minimum for majorization among all eigenvalues of frame operators of

equivalent way: given a finite sequence of vectors $\mathcal F_0$ in $\C^d$ we
show that the completions with prescribed norms that minimize the convex

the sense that they do not depend on the particular choice of the convex

  71 Pages",,,,"q-bio.TO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Sauropoda were the largest terrestrial animals ever to have lived on this
planet. As their nutritional requirements were so huge, their diet holds sway
over the ecology of many Mesozoic herbivores. The diet of the sauropods is
limited by their feeding envelope, which in turn is governed by the posture and
flexibility of their elongate necks. Yet the exact nature of the flexibility
and posture of the neck has been a contentious issue. Previous studies have
utilised computer models of dry bone, mechanical principles or the flexibility
of the necks of extant animals. However, the effect of the musculature of the
neck has yet to be investigated. Through measurements of the flexibility of the
ostrich neck after cumulative tissue removal, analyses of the muscle attachment
sites of the ostrich and sauropods, and testing of the Osteological Neutral
Pose model, this study attempts to rectify this situation. The ostrich neck was
shown to have three sections of flexibility; a slightly flexible anterior
section, a very flexible middle section and a stiff posterior section. The
Osteological Neutral Pose did not show these sections, and was shown to
potentially overestimate and underestimate flexibility. It was also found that
the inter-vertebral space could account for varying estimates of flexibility,
and that sauropods would have proportionally more muscle mass at the base of
the neck in relation to the ostrich. Ultimately, it was shown that the tissues
of the neck place the limits of flexibility, and that zygapophyseal overlap
does not indicate the flexibility of the neck. Should the Osteological Neutral
Pose affect sauropod flexibility estimates in the same manner as that of the
ostrich (a general overestimate), then the sauropods would have a more limited
feeding envelope than previously thought, allowing for greater niche
partitioning between groups.

This work addresses this issue by building a middleware framework, which maps

more natural and customized user-experience but it also defines an
interoperable virtual controller. In this version of the framework, body poses
and voice commands are respectively recognized through the Kinect's built-in
cameras and microphones. The acquired data is then translated into the native
interaction scheme in real time using a lightweight method based on spatial
restrictions. The system is also prepared to use Nintendo's Wiimote as an
auxiliary and unobtrusive gamepad for physically or verbally impractical
commands. System validation was performed by analyzing the performance of
certain tasks and examining user reports. Both confirmed this approach as a
practical and alluring alternative to the game's native interaction scheme. In
sum, this framework provides a game-controlling tool that is totally
customizable and very flexible, thus expanding the market of game consumers.

construction of finite-state models that are related to the original control
systems, then use techniques from finite-state synthesis to compute controllers
satisfying specifications given in a temporal logic, and finally translate the
synthesized schemes back as controllers for the concrete complex systems. Such
approaches have been successfully developed and implemented for the synthesis
of controllers over non-probabilistic control systems. In this paper, we extend
the technique to probabilistic control systems modeled by controlled stochastic
differential equations. We show that for every stochastic control system
satisfying a probabilistic variant of incremental input-to-state stability, and
for every given precision $\varepsilon>0$, a finite-state transition system can
be constructed, which is $\varepsilon$-approximately bisimilar (in the sense of
moments) to the original stochastic control system. Moreover, we provide
results relating stochastic control systems to their corresponding finite-state
transition systems in terms of probabilistic bisimulation relations known in
the literature. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the construction by
synthesizing controllers for stochastic control systems over rich
specifications expressed in linear temporal logic. The discussed technique
enables a new, automated, correct-by-construction controller synthesis approach

information transfer between the spin variables. At this point the amount of
information that can be redistributed by some nodes reaches a limit and the net

on the nodes that are more prone to became bottlenecks of information. The

a toroidal magnetic field generated by the flow of gas along field lines. It is
suggested that the axial magnetic field strength may be derived from the excess
line width of the HI emission over and above that due to kinetic temperature by
invoking the role of Alfven waves that create what is in essence a form of
magnetic turbulence. At a distance of 200 pc the axial and the derived toroidal

the clouds they are about 4 microGauss. The dependence of the derived field

low-mass protostar HOPS-68. Our spectrum, obtained with the Infrared
Spectrograph onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope, reveals a 15.2 micron CO2 ice
bending mode profile that cannot modeled with the same ice structure typically
found toward other protostars. We develop a modified CO2 ice profile
decomposition, including the addition of new high-quality laboratory spectra of
pure, crystalline CO2 ice. Using this model, we find that 87-92% of the CO2 is
sequestered as spherical, CO2-rich mantles, while typical interstellar ices
show evidence of irregularly-shaped, hydrogen-rich mantles. We propose that (1)
the nearly complete absence of unprocessed ices along the line-of-sight is due
to the flattened envelope structure of HOPS-68, which lacks cold absorbing
material in its outer envelope, and possesses an extreme concentration of
material within its inner (10 AU) envelope region and (2) an energetic event
led to the evaporation of inner envelope ices, followed by cooling and
re-condensation, explaining the sequestration of spherical, CO2 ice mantles in
a hydrogen-poor mixture. The mechanism responsible for the sublimation could be
either a transient accretion event or shocks in the interaction region between
the protostellar outflow and envelope. The proposed scenario is consistent with
the rarity of the observed CO2 ice profile, the formation of nearly pure CO2
ice, and the production of spherical ice mantles. HOPS-68 may therefore provide
a unique window into the protostellar feedback process, as outflows and heating
shape the physical and chemical structure of protostellar envelopes and
molecular clouds.

battery that provides power to the circuit, thereby lighting up the pair just
before merger. Although originally suggested as a promising electromagnetic
counterpart to gravitational-wave detection, the luminous signals are promising
more generally as potentially detectable phenomena, such as short gamma-ray
bursts. To aid in the theoretical understanding, we present analytic solutions
for the electromagnetic fields of a magnetic dipole in the presence of an event

magnetic dipole on an arbitrary worldline. We present these solutions here and

ensure the presence of hot interior gas. Three PNe showing nebular O VI, namely
IC 418, NGC 2392, and NGC 6826, have been selected for Chandra observations and
diffuse X-ray emission is indeed detected in each of these PNe. Among the
three, NGC 2392 has peculiarly high diffuse X-ray luminosity and plasma
temperature compared with those expected from its stellar wind's mechanical
luminosity and terminal velocity. The limited effects of heat conduction on the
plasma temperature of a hot bubble at the low terminal velocity of the stellar
wind of NGC 2392 may partially account for its high plasma temperature, but the
high X-ray luminosity needs to be powered by processes other than the observed
stellar wind, probably caused by the presence of an unseen binary companion of
the CSPN of NGC 2392. We have compiled relevant information on the X-ray,
stellar, and nebular properties of PNe with a bubble morphology and found that
the expectations of bubble models including heat conduction compare favorably
with the present X-ray observations of hot bubbles around H-rich CSPNe, but
have notable discrepancies for those around H-poor [WR] CSPNe. We note that PNe
with more massive central stars can produce hotter plasma and higher X-ray
surface brightness inside central hot bubbles.

based on the FEniCS system is presented. Its main features are an intuitive
mathematical interface, a high degree of automation, and an efficient
implementation of the generated adjoint model. The framework is based upon the
extension of a domain-specific language for variational problems to cleanly
express complex optimisation problems in a compact, high-level syntax. For
example, optimisation problems constrained by the time-dependent Navier-Stokes
equations can be written in tens of lines of code. Based on this high-level
representation, the framework derives the associated adjoint equations in the
same domain-specific language, and uses the FEniCS code generation technology
to emit parallel optimised low-level C++ code for the solution of the forward
and adjoint systems. The functional and gradient information so computed is
then passed to the optimisation algorithm to update the parameter values. This
approach works both for steady-state as well as transient, and for linear as
well as nonlinear governing PDEs and a wide range of functionals and control
parameters. We demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of this approach on
classical textbook optimisation problems and advanced examples.

velocity and angular dependence of self-scattering more broadly, in the
strongly-coupled resonant and classical regimes where many partial modes are

this method over the existing methods are reliability and explicit error

  The need for a numerical solution is motivated by difficulties in computation
of the exact solution. The approximation developed in this paper is with a view
of generalisation to matrix Wiener-Hopf for which the exact solution, in

  The second part of the paper describes the approach of approximately solving
the Wiener-Hopf equation that employs the Rational Caratheodory-Fejer

to the unit interval. Numerical examples to demonstrate the use of the proposed

minimal automaton has n states), then its syntactic complexity is at most n^n

has at most 2^n atoms and this bound is tight. The maximal quotient complexity
of any atom with r complemented quotients is 2^n-1, if r=0 or r=n, and

ideal glass, stresses relax only partially, leaving behind a finite persistent
residual stress. For intermediate times, relaxation curves scale as a function
of $\dot\gamma t$, even though no flow is present. The macroscopic stress
evolution is connected to a length scale of residual liquefaction displayed by
microscopic mean-squared displacements. The theory describes this history
dependence of glasses sharing the same thermodynamic state variables, but
differing static properties.

analysis method which targets repeated long quasi-monochromatic transients
(triggers) from cosmic sources. The algorithm concept can be applied to
multi-trigger data sets in which the detector-source orientation and the
statistical properties of the data stream change with time, and does not
require the assumption that the data is Gaussian. Reconstructing or limiting
the energetics of potential gravitational wave emissions associated with
quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in the X-ray lightcurve tails of
soft gamma repeater flares might be an interesting endeavour of the future.
Therefore we chose this in a simplified form to illustrate the flow,
capabilities, and performance of the method. We investigate performance aspects
of a multi-trigger based data analysis approach by using O(100 s) long
stretches of mock data in coincidence with the times of observed QPOs, and by
using the known sky location of the source. We analytically derive the PDF of
the background distribution and compare to the results obtained by applying the
concept to simulated Gaussian noise, as well as off-source playground data
collected by the 4-km Hanford detector (H1) during LIGO's fifth science run
(S5). We show that the transient glitch rejection and adaptive differential
energy comparison methods we apply succeed in rejecting outliers in the S5
background data. Finally, we discuss how to extend the method to a network
containing multiple detectors, and as an example, tune the method to maximize
sensitivity to SGR 1806-20 flare times.

efficiency. We show that k-d darts are useful for exploring a function's
properties, such as estimating its integral, or finding an exemplar above a

  We demonstrate that k-d darts are more efficient than point-wise samples in
high dimensions, depending on the characteristics of the sampling domain: e.g.
the subregion of interest has small volume and evaluating the function along a
flat is not too expensive. We present three concrete applications using line
darts (1-d darts): relaxed maximal Poisson-disk sampling, high-quality
rasterization of depth-of-field blur, and estimation of the probability of
failure from a response surface for uncertainty quantification. In these
applications, line darts achieve the same fidelity output as point darts in
less time. We also demonstrate the accuracy of higher dimensional darts for a
volume estimation problem. For Poisson-disk sampling, we use significantly less

estimation of the maximum-likelihood parameter values of constrained
multivariate autoregressive Gaussian state-space (MARSS) models. The MARSS
model can be written: x(t)=Bx(t-1)+u+w(t), y(t)=Zx(t)+a+v(t), where w(t) and
v(t) are multivariate normal error-terms with variance-covariance matrices Q
and R respectively. MARSS models are a class of dynamic linear model and vector
autoregressive state-space model. Shumway and Stoffer presented an
unconstrained EM algorithm for this class of models in 1982, and a number of
researchers have presented EM algorithms for specific types of constrained
MARSS models since then. In this report, I present a general EM algorithm for
constrained MARSS models, where the constraints are on the elements within the
parameter matrices (B,u,Q,Z,a,R). The constraints take the form vec(M)=f+Dm,
where M is the parameter matrix, f is a column vector of fixed values, D is a
matrix of multipliers, and m is the column vector of estimated values. This
allows a wide variety of constrained parameter matrix forms. The presentation
is for a time-varying MARSS model, where time-variation enters through the
fixed (meaning not estimated) f(t) and D(t) matrices for each parameter. The
algorithm allows missing values in y and partially deterministic systems where
0s appear on the diagonals of Q or R. Open source code for estimating MARSS
models with this algorithm is provided in the MARSS R package on the
Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).

The
model contains, in addition to the standard model (SM) Higgs boson, an inert
SU(2)_L doublet scalar eta and two inert singlet scalars phi and chi. The
lepton number is softly broken by a dimension-two operator, and the tree-level
Dirac mass is forbidden by Z_2 x Z_2' (or D_{2N}), which predicts the existence
of two or three dark matter particles. The scalar sector is minimal; none of
the scalar fields can be suppressed for the radiative seesaw mechanism to work.
There are by-products: The SM Higgs boson decay into two gamma's is slightly
enhanced by eta^+ (the charged component of eta) circulating in one-loop
diagrams for h to gamma gamma. The 135 GeV gamma-ray line observed at the Fermi
LAT can be also explained by the annihilation of chi dark matter. We employ a
mechanism of temperature-dependent annihilation cross section to suppress the
continuum gamma rays and the production of antiprotons. The explanation can
survive even down to the XENON1T sensitivity limit.

detailed structures of the dense envelope within the core. We found that the

in the power-law indices between the outer and inner regions of the core: p~2

overall velocity gradient of ~1.0 km s^-1 over the scale of 20,000 AU across
the outflow axis. We believe that this velocity gradient represents a
solid-body-like rotation of the core. The dense envelope has a quite
symmetrical velocity structure with a remarkable line broadening toward the
core center, which is especially prominent in the position-velocity diagram
across the outflow axis. The model calculations of position-velocity diagrams
do a good job of reproducing observational results using the collapse model of
an isothermal sphere in which the core has an inner free-fall region and an
outer region conserving the conditions at the formation stage of a central
stellar object. We derived a central stellar mass of ~0.1 M_sun, and suggest a
small inward velocity, v(r>r_inf) ~ 0 km s^-1 in the outer core at >= 4000 AU.
We concluded that our data can be well explained by gravitational collapse with
a quasi-static initial condition, such as Shu's model, or by the isothermal
collapse of a marginally critical Bonnor-Ebert sphere.

questions regarding neural systems:
  1) How the activity of neurons, via synaptic changes, can shape the topology
of the network they form part of, and
  2) How the resulting network structure, in its turn, might condition aspects
of brain behaviour.
  Although the emphasis is on neural networks, several theoretical findings
which are relevant for complex networks in general are presented -- such as a
method for studying network evolution as a stochastic process, or a theory that
allows for ensembles of correlated networks, and sets of dynamical elements
thereon, to be treated mathematically and computationally in a
model-independent manner. Some of the results are used to explain experimental
data -- certain properties of brain tissue, the spontaneous emergence of
correlations in all kinds of networks... -- and predictions regarding
statistical aspects of the central nervous system are made. The mechanism of
Cluster Reverberation is proposed to account for the near-instant storage of
novel information the brain is capable of.

are released over list and provide a nearly optimal online algorithm. More
precisely, an online algorithm whose competitive ratio is at most (1+\epsilon)
times that of an optimal online algorithm could be achieved in polynomial time,
where m, the number of machines, is a part of the input. It substantially
improves upon the previous results by almost closing the gap between the
currently best known lower bound of 1.88 (Rudin, Ph.D thesis, 2001) and the
best known upper bound of 1.92 (Fleischer, Wahl, Journal of Scheduling, 2000).
It has been known by folklore that an online problem could be viewed as a game
between an adversary and the online player. Our approach extensively explores
such a structure and builds up a completely new framework to show that, for the
online over list scheduling problem, given any \epsilon>0, there exists a
uniform threshold K which is polynomial in m such that if the competitive ratio
of an online algorithm is \rho<=2, then there exists a list of at most K jobs
to enforce the online algorithm to achieve a competitive ratio of at least
\rho-O(\epsilon). Our approach is substantially different from that of Gunther
et al. (Gunther et al., SODA 2013), in which an approximation scheme for online
over time scheduling problems is given, where the number of machines is fixed.
Our method could also be extended to several related online over list
scheduling models.

with its different input parameters, to choose the most appropriate one. There
are several clustering validity techniques based on inner density and outer
density of clusters that represent different metrics to choose the most
appropriate clustering independent of the input parameters. According to
dependency of previous methods on the input parameters, one challenge in facing
with large systems, is to complete data incrementally that effects on the final
choice of the most appropriate clustering. Those methods define the existence
of high intensity in a cluster, and low intensity among different clusters as

cosmic gamma-rays which is complementary to observations by imaging Cherenkov
telescopes. Their particular strength lies in the multi-TeV to ultra high
energy range (E > 30 TeV), where large effective areas, yet small light
sensitive areas per detector station are needed. To exploit this potential to
full extent, a large station spacing is required to achieve a large effective
area at a reasonable effort. In such a detector, the low number of signals per
event, the absence of imaging information, and the poor signal to noise ratio
of Cherenkov light to night sky brightness pose considerable challenges for the
event reconstruction, especially the gamma hadron separation. The event
reconstruction presented in this paper has been developed for the wide-angle
detector HiSCORE, but the concepts may be applied more generically. It is
tested on simulated data in the 10 TeV to 5 PeV energy range. For the tests, a
regular grid of 22 x 22 detector stations with a spacing of 150 m is assumed,
covering an area of 10 km^2. The angular resolution of individual events is
found to be about 0.3 degree near the energy threshold, improving to below 0.1
degree at higher energies. The relative energy resolution is 20% at the
threshold and improves to 10% at higher energies. Several parameters for gamma
hadron separation are described. With a combination of these parameters, 80% to
90% of the hadronic background can be suppressed, while about 60% of the
gamma-ray events are retained. The point source sensitivity to gamma-ray
sources is estimated, with conservative assumptions, to be about 8 x 10^(-13)
erg / s / cm^2 at 100 TeV gamma-ray for a 10 km^2 array. With more optimistic
assumptions, and a 100 km^2 array, a sensitivity of about 1 x 10^(-13) erg / s
/ cm^2 can be achieved (at 100 TeV).

find a condition in which the antenna molecules faithfully play their roles:
Their effective absorption ratios are larger than those of the receiver
molecule directly coupled to the reaction center. In the absence of
energy-level mismatches and dephasing noise, there arises quantum destructive
interference between multiple paths that restricts the energy transfer. On the
other hand, the destructive interference diminishes as asymmetrically biasing
the energy-level mismatches and/or introducing quantum noise of dephasing for
the antenna molecules, so that the transfer efficiency is greatly enhanced to
near unity. Remarkably, the near-unity efficiency can be achieved at a wide
range of asymmetric energy-level mismatches. Temporal characteristics are also
optimized at the energy-level mismatches where the transfer efficiency is near
unity. We discuss these effects, in particular, for the Fenna-Matthews-Olson

adding an optimal weighted Hoelder semi-norm. To achieve this we first obtain a
local improvement. We also obtain a refinement of both the Sobolev inequality
for $p>n$ and the Hardy inequality, the latter having the best constant.

mass-energy equivalence from special relativity. However, exploiting a double
spherical shell model, it will be shown that the ensuing gravitational
self-energy and mass renormalization prevent the formation of such an object.

  Communication System","This paper has been accepted in IEEE trans. on Communications (will
  appear soon on IEEE explore). arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with
  arXiv:1303.2552",,"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.071013.130225",,"cs.OH","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  A new Multi-Carrier Differential Chaos Shift Keying (MC-DCSK) modulation is
presented in this paper. The system endeavors to provide a good trade-off
between robustness, energy efficiency and high data rate, while still being
simple compared to conventional multi-carrier spread spectrum systems. This
system can be seen as a parallel extension of the DCSK modulation where one
chaotic reference sequence is transmitted over a predefined subcarrier
frequency. Multiple modulated data streams are transmitted over the remaining
subcarriers. This transmitter structure increases the spectral efficiency of
the conventional DCSK system and uses less energy. The receiver design makes
this system easy to implement where no radio frequency (RF) delay circuit is
needed to demodulate received data. Various system design parameters are
discussed throughout the paper, including the number of subcarriers, the
spreading factor, and the transmitted energy. Once the design is explained, the
bit error rate performance of the MC-DCSK system is computed and compared to
the conventional DCSK system under an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and
Rayleigh channels. Simulation results confirm the advantages of this new hybrid
design.

best guess for the given data, we consider optimal regions of estimators. As
the natural counterpart of the popular maximum-likelihood point estimator, we
introduce the maximum-likelihood region---the region of largest likelihood
among all regions of the same size. Here, the size of a region is its prior
probability. Another concept is the smallest credible region---the smallest
region with pre-chosen posterior probability. For both optimization problems,
the optimal region has constant likelihood on its boundary. We discuss criteria
for assigning prior probabilities to regions, and illustrate the concepts and
methods with several examples.

simultaneously, using a conjugate gradient method. The degrees of degeneracy of

edges established by citations. The most relevant factor was content
similarity, while the other two - in-degree (i.e. citation counts) and {age of

dependence indicates that additional factors could play a role. Indeed, by
intuition one should expect the reputation (or visibility) of authors and/or

considered via the in-degree that should correlate with such reputation.
Because information on reputation is not readily available, we simulated its
effect on artificial citation networks considering two communities with
distinct fitness (visibility) parameters. One community was assumed to have
twice the fitness value of the other, which amounts to a double probability for
a paper being cited. While the h-index for authors in the community with larger

addition of rocky material. They form a flat disk, as the result of an
interplay of angular momentum conservation and the steady loss of energy in
dissipative inter-particle collisions. For particles in the size range from a
few centimeters to a few meters, a power-law distribution of radii, $\sim
r^{-q}$ with $q \approx 3$, has been inferred; for larger sizes, the
distribution has a steep cutoff. It has been suggested that this size
distribution may arise from a balance between aggregation and fragmentation of
ring particles, yet neither the power-law dependence nor the upper size cutoff
have been established on theoretical grounds. Here we propose a model for the
particle size distribution that quantitatively explains the observations. In
accordance with data, our model predicts the exponent $q$ to be constrained to
the interval $2.75 \le q \le 3.5$. Also an exponential cutoff for larger
particle sizes establishes naturally with the cutoff-radius being set by the
relative frequency of aggregating and disruptive collisions. This cutoff is
much smaller than the typical scale of micro-structures seen in Saturn's rings.

movements over the last 5 centuries. The most important factor contributing to
the distinction between different literary styles was {the average shortest

over time there has been a trend toward larger average shortest path lengths,
which is correlated with increased syntactic complexity, and a more uniform use
of the words reflected in a smaller power-law coefficient for the distribution

mathematical model is described via a probability measure. The joint
distribution of the unknown input and the data is then conditioned, using
Bayes' formula, giving rise to the posterior distribution on the unknown input.
In this setting we prove posterior consistency for nonlinear inverse problems:
a sequence of data is considered, with diminishing fluctuations around a single
truth and it is then of interest to show that the resulting sequence of
posterior measures arising from this sequence of data concentrates around the
truth used to generate the data. Posterior consistency justifies the use of the
Bayesian approach very much in the same way as error bounds and convergence
results for regularisation techniques do. As a guiding example, we consider the
inverse problem of reconstructing the diffusion coefficient from noisy
observations of the solution to an elliptic PDE in divergence form. This
problem is approached by splitting the forward operator into the underlying
continuum model and a simpler observation operator based on the output of the
model.
  In general, these splittings allow us to conclude posterior consistency
provided a deterministic stability result for the underlying inverse problem
and a posterior consistency result for the Bayesian regression problem with the
push-forward prior.
  Moreover, we prove posterior consistency for the Bayesian regression problem
based on the regularity, the tail behaviour and the small ball probabilities of
the prior.

function and the inhibition of this function by drug molecules. Many enzymes
change from an open to a closed conformation upon binding of substrate or
inhibitor molecules. These conformational changes have been suggested to follow
an induced-fit mechanism in which the molecules first bind in the open
conformation in those cases where binding in the closed conformation appears to
be sterically obstructed such as for the HIV-1 protease. In this article, we
present a general model for the catalysis and inhibition of enzymes with
induced-fit binding mechanism. We derive general expressions that specify how
the overall catalytic rate of the enzymes depends on the rates for binding, for
the conformational changes, and for the chemical reaction. Based on these
expressions, we analyze the effect of mutations that mainly shift the
conformational equilibrium on catalysis and inhibition. If the overall
catalytic rate is limited by product unbinding, we find that mutations that
destabilize the closed conformation relative to the open conformation increase
the catalytic rate in the presence of inhibitors by a factor exp(ddG/RT) where
ddG is the mutation-induced shift of the free-energy difference between the
conformations. This increase in the catalytic rate due to changes in the
conformational equilibrium is independent of the inhibitor molecule and, thus,
may help to understand how non-active-site mutations can contribute to the
multi-drug-resistance that has been observed for the HIV-1 protease. A
comparison to experimental data for the non-active-site mutation L90M of the
HIV-1 protease indicates that the mutation slightly destabilizes the closed
conformation of the enzyme.

Ver{\dh}trygg{\dh} l\'an, negatively amortised, index-linked loans whose
outstanding principal is increased by the rate of the consumer price inflation
index(CPI). The loans were part of a general government policy which used
indexation to the CPI to address the economic consequences of the
hyperinflation. Although most other forms of indexation were subsequently
removed, loan indexation has remained, and these loans now comprise the
majority of mortgages in Iceland. Although it is still often argued that
index-linked loans helped to stop the hyperinflation, these arguments are
typically based on high level macro-economic interpretations of the Icelandic
economy, they fail to identify specific mechanisms to support their claims. In
this paper we take the opposite approach, and present a detailed analysis of
the monetary mechanics used for the loans at the double entry bookkeeping level
of the banking system.
  Based on this analysis there appears to be no evidence or mechanism that
would support the claim that index-linked loans reduce or stop inflation. On
the contrary: our research shows that the bookkeeping treatment of these loans
within the banking system directly contributes to the banking system's monetary
expansion rate, and hence index-linked loans act to increase the inflation rate
to which they are linked, rather than reducing it. They consequently create a
positive feedback loop within the banking system's monetary regulation
operating directly on the money supply. Since the feedback into monetary
expansion only occurs at annual CPI rates above approximately 2%, we suggest
one solution would be to stabilise the money supply to 0% growth, and we
explore some ways this could be achieved by modifying the Basel Regulatory
Framework within the Icelandic Banking System.

model based on the hydrodynamic drift-diffusion approximation are presented and
compared. The comparison with the MC model clearly validates our high order
fluid model, thus supporting its correct theoretical derivation and numerical

results with an approximation for the high order tensor in the energy flux

$\varphi(s)=c_0 s+\psi(s)$, where $c_0$ is a nonnegative integer and $\psi$ a

half-plane into the half-plane $\operatorname{Re} s >1/2$ if $c_0=0$ and is
either identically zero or maps the right half-plane into itself if $c_0$ is
positive. It is shown that the $n$th approximation numbers of bounded

$r^n$ for some $0<r<1$ when $c_0=0$ and bounded below by a constant times
$n^{-A}$ for some $A>0$ when $c_0$ is positive. Both results are best possible.
The case when $c_0=0$, $\psi$ is bounded and smooth up to the boundary of the
right half-plane, and $\sup \operatorname{Re} \psi=1/2$, is discussed in depth;
it includes examples of non-compact operators as well as operators belonging to
all Schatten classes $S_p$. For $\varphi(s)=c_1+\sum_{j=1}^d c_{q_j} q_j^{-s}$
with $q_j$ independent integers, it is shown that the $n$th approximation
number behaves as $n^{-(d-1)/2}$, possibly up to a factor $(\log n)^{(d-1)/2}$.
Estimates rely mainly on a general Hilbert space method involving finite linear
combinations of reproducing kernels. A key role is played by a recently
developed interpolation method for $\mathscr{H}^2$ using estimates of solutions
of the $\bar{\partial}$ equation. Finally, by a transference principle from
$H^2$ of the unit disc, explicit examples of compact composition operators with
approximation numbers decaying at essentially any sub-exponential rate can be
displayed.

frequency agile and the nodes will be equipped with multiple radios capable of
tuning across large swaths of spectrum. The MAC scheduling problem in such
networks refers to making intelligent decisions on which communication links to
activate at which time instant and over which frequency band. The challenge in
designing a low-complexity distributed MAC, that achieves low delay, is posed
by two additional dimensions of cognitive radio networks: interference graphs
and data rates that are frequency-band dependent, and explosion in number of
feasible schedules due to large number of available frequency-bands. In this
paper, we propose MAXIMALGAIN MAC, a distributed MAC scheduler for frequency
agile multi-band networks that simultaneously achieves the following: (i)
optimal network-delay scaling with respect to the number of communicating
pairs, (ii) low computational complexity of O(log2(maximum degree of the
interference graphs)) which is independent of the number of frequency bands,
number of radios per node, and overall size of the network, and (iii)
robustness, i.e., it can be adapted to a scenario where nodes are not
synchronized and control packets could be lost. Our proposed MAC also achieves
a throughput provably within a constant fraction (under isotropic propagation)
of the maximum throughput. Due to a recent impossibility result, optimal
delay-scaling could only be achieved with some amount of throughput loss [30].
Extensive simulations using OMNeT++ network simulator shows that, compared to a
multi-band extension of a state-of-art CSMA algorithm (namely, Q-CSMA), our
asynchronous algorithm achieves a 2.5x? reduction in delay while achieving at
least 85% of the maximum achievable throughput. Our MAC algorithms are derived
from a novel local search based technique.

between a small set of slowly evolving variables and much larger set of rapidly
changing variables, direct numerical simulations of such systems are difficult
to carry out due to many dynamical variables and the need for an extremely
small time discretization step to resolve fast dynamics. One of the common
remedies for that is to approximate a multiscale dynamical systems by a closed
approximate model for slow variables alone, which reduces the total effective
dimension of the phase space of dynamics, as well as allows for a longer time
discretization step. Recently we developed a new method for constructing a
deterministic reduced model of multiscale dynamics where coupling terms were
parameterized via the Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem. In this work we further
improve this previously developed method for deterministic reduced models of
multiscale dynamics by introducing a new method for parameterizing slow-fast
interactions through additive stochastic noise in a systematic fashion. For the
two-scale Lorenz 96 system with linear coupling, we demonstrate that the new
method is able to recover additional features of multiscale dynamics in a
stochastically forced reduced model, which the previously developed

star system NSVS 14256825. As is the case for other recently proposed
circumbinary planetary systems detected through the timing of mutual eclipses
between the central binary stars, the proposed planets do not stand up to
dynamical scrutiny. The proposed orbits for the two planets are extremely
unstable on timescales of less than a thousand years, regardless of the mutual
inclination between the planetary orbits.
  For the scenario where the planetary orbits are coplanar, a small region of
moderate stability was observed, featuring orbits that were somewhat protected
from destabilisation by the influence of mutual 2:1 mean-motion resonance
between the orbits of the planets. Even in this stable region, however, the
systems tested typically only survived on timescales of order 1 million years,
far shorter than the age of the system.

they must move on orbits dramatically different to those proposed in the

any obstacle in designing truthful mechanisms, even for multi-parameter
domains, and even when we can only call the allocation rule once. We present a
general reduction that takes any allocation rule which satisfies ""cyclic
monotonicity"" (a known necessary and sufficient condition for truthfulness) and
converts it to a truthful mechanism using a single call to the allocation rule,
with arbitrarily small loss to the expected social welfare.
  A prominent example for a multi-parameter setting in which an allocation rule
can only be called once arises in sponsored search auctions. These are
multi-parameter domains when each advertiser has multiple possible ads he may
display, each with a different value per click. Moreover, the mechanism
typically does not have complete knowledge of the click-realization or the
click-through rates (CTRs); it can only call the allocation rule a single time
and observe the click information for ads that were presented. % are not known.
On the negative side, we show that an allocation that is truthful for any
realization essentially cannot depend on the bids, and hence cannot do better
than random selection for one agent. We then consider a relaxed requirement of
truthfulness, only in expectation over the CTRs. Even for that relaxed version,
making any progress is challenging as standard techniques for construction of
truthful mechanisms (as using VCG or an MIDR allocation rule) cannot be used in
this setting. We design an allocation rule with non-trivial performance and
directly prove it is cyclic-monotone, and thus it can be used to create a
truthful mechanism using our general reduction.

Cluster, the nearest and X-ray brightest hot, dynamically active, non-cool core
system, focusing on the thermodynamic properties of the ICM on large scales.
For azimuths not aligned with an infalling subcluster towards the southwest,
our measured temperature and X-ray brightness profiles exhibit broadly
consistent radial trends, with the temperature decreasing from about 8.5 keV at
the cluster center to about 2 keV at a radius of 2 Mpc, which is the edge of
our detection limit. The SW merger significantly boosts the surface brightness,
allowing us to detect X-ray emission out to ~2.2 Mpc along this direction.
Apart from the southwestern infalling subcluster, the surface brightness
profiles show multiple edges around radii of 30-40 arcmin. The azimuthally
averaged temperature profile, as well as the deprojected density and pressure
profiles, all show a sharp drop consistent with an outward propagating shock
front located at 40 arcmin, corresponding to the outermost edge of the giant
radio halo observed at 352 MHz with the WSRT. The shock front may be powering
this radio emission. A clear entropy excess inside of r_500 reflects the
violent merging events linked with these morphological features. Beyond r_500,
the entropy profiles of the Coma Cluster along the relatively relaxed
directions are consistent with the power-law behavior expected from simple

  optimization problem","10 pages, 7 figures, one table",,,,"cs.NE cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Radial Basis Functions Neural Networks (RBFNNs) are tools widely used in
regression problems. One of their principal drawbacks is that the formulation
corresponding to the training with the supervision of both the centers and the
weights is a highly non-convex optimization problem, which leads to some
fundamentally difficulties for traditional optimization theory and methods.
  This paper presents a generalized canonical duality theory for solving this
challenging problem. We demonstrate that by sequential canonical dual
transformations, the nonconvex optimization problem of the RBFNN can be
reformulated as a canonical dual problem (without duality gap). Both global
optimal solution and local extrema can be classified. Several applications to
one of the most used Radial Basis Functions, the Gaussian function, are
illustrated. Our results show that even for one-dimensional case, the global
minimizer of the nonconvex problem may not be the best solution to the RBFNNs,
and the canonical dual theory is a promising tool for solving general neural
networks training problems.

scattering theory for pairs of self-adjoint operators $H_0$ and $H_1$ on a

open bounded subset $\Delta$ of $\mathbb R,$ the operators $F E_\Delta^{H_0}$
and $F E_\Delta^{H_1}$ are Hilbert-Schmidt and (ii) $V = H_1- H_0$ is bounded
and admits decomposition $V = F^*JF,$ where $F$ is a bounded operator with
trivial kernel from $\mathcal H$ to another Hilbert space $\mathcal K$ and $J$

existence and completeness of wave operators $W_\pm(H_1,H_0)$ and a new
constructive proof of stationary formula for the scattering matrix. This
approach to scattering theory is based on explicit diagonalization of a
self-adjoint operator $H$ on a sheaf of Hilbert spaces $\EuScript S(H,F)$

$\EuScript S(H_0,F)$ and $\EuScript S(H_1,F)$ respectively. The wave operators
$W_\pm(H_1,H_0)$ are then defined as direct integrals of wave matrices and are
proved to coincide with classical time-dependent definition of wave operators.

dielectric material. The commonly used material for building the best cryogenic
microwave oscillators is sapphire. However sapphire is becoming a limiting
factor for higher frequencies design. It is then important to find new
candidates that can fulfil the requirements for millimetre wave low noise
oscillators at room and cryogenic temperatures. These clocks are used as a
reference in many fields, like modern telecommunication systems, radio
astronomy (VLBI), and precision measurements at the quantum limit.
High-resolution measurements were made of the temperature-dependence of the
electromagnetic properties of a polycrystalline diamond disk at temperatures
between 35 K and 330 K at microwave to sub-millimetre wave frequencies. The
cryogenic measurements were made using a TE01{\delta} dielectric mode resonator
placed inside a vacuum chamber connected to a single-stage pulse-tube
cryocooler. The high frequency characterization was performed at room
temperature using a combination of a quasi-optical two-lens transmission setup,
a Fabry-Perot cavity and a whispering gallery mode resonator excited with
waveguides. Our CVD diamond sample exhibits a decreasing loss tangent with
increasing frequencies. We compare the results with well known crystals. This
comparison makes clear that polycrystalline diamond could be an important

structure determination of proteins has been presented here. Compared to
currently available strategies used for the purpose, the method employs only a
single reduced dimensionality (RD) experiment -(4,3)D-hnCOCANH and exploits the
linear combinations of backbone (13Ca and 13C') chemical shifts to achieve a
dispersion relatively better compared to those of individual chemical shifts
(see the text) for efficient and rapid data analysis. Further, the experiment
leads to the spectrum with direct distinction of self (intra-residue) and
sequential (inter-residue) carbon correlation peaks; these appear opposite in
signs and therefore can easily be discriminated without using an additional
complementary experiment. On top of all this, the main strength of the method
is its efficient and robust assignment strategy based on: (a) multiple, but
unidirectional sequential 15N and 13C correlations (i-->i-1) and (b) the
distinctive peak patterns of self and sequential peaks in different
[(F1(13C)-F3(1H) and (F2(15N)-F3(1H)] planes of the 3D spectrum which enable
ready identification of certain specific triplet sequences (see the text) and
thus serve as check points for mapping the stretches of sequentially connected
HSQC cross peaks on to the primary sequence for assigning the resonances
sequence specifically. Overall, the standalone method presented here will be an
important backbone assignment tool for structural and functional proteomics,
protein folding, and drug discovery research programs by NMR.

  D",,"10.1103/PhysRevD.87.064043","RUP-13-2","gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a renormalization group analysis to Einstein-Rosen waves or vacuum
spacetimes with whole-cylinder symmetry. It is found that self-similar
solutions appear as fixed points in the renormalization group transformation.
These solutions correspond to the explosive gravitational waves and the
collapsing gravitational waves at late times and early times, respectively.
Based on the linear perturbation analysis of the self-similar solutions, we
conclude that the self-similar evolution is stable as explosive gravitational
waves under the condition of no incoming waves, while it is weakly unstable as
collapsing gravitational waves. The result implies that self-similar solutions
can describe the asymptotic behavior of more general solutions for exploding
gravitational waves and thus extends the similarity hypothesis in general
relativity from spherical symmetry to cylindrical symmetry.

nonlinear shifts for Xe are opposite in sign to the previously measured shifts
for Ar and Kr, even though all three gases have negative linear shifts. The Xe

Most of this discrepancy is eliminated by accounting for the spin-rotation

the limit of our experimental accuracy, the shifts of 87Rb and 133Cs in He, Ne,

Examples include Willmore surfaces, stationary solitons for the surface
diffusion flow, and biharmonic immersed surfaces in the sense of Chen. On the
boundary we enforce either umbilic or flat boundary conditions: that the
tracefree second fundamental form and its derivative or the full second
fundamental form and its derivative vanish. For the umbilic boundary condition
we prove that any surface with small L^2-norm of the tracefree second
fundamental form or full second fundamental form must be totally umbilic; that
is, a union of pieces of round spheres and flat planes. We prove that the
stricter smallness condition allows consideration for a broader range of
differential operators. For the flat boundary condition we prove the same
result with weaker hypotheses, allowing more general operators, and a stronger
conclusion: only pieces of planes are allowed. The method used relies only on
the smallness assumption and thus holds without requiring the imposition of
additional symmetries. The result holds in the class of surfaces with any genus
and irrespective of the number or shape of the boundaries.

domains has led to a dramatic rise in the number of distributed data management
systems, both parallel relational databases, and systems that support
alternative frameworks like MapReduce. There is thus an increasing contention
on scarce data center resources like network bandwidth; further, the energy
requirements for powering the computing equipment are also growing
dramatically. As we show empirically, increasing the execution parallelism by
spreading out data across a large number of machines may achieve the intended
goal of decreasing query latencies, but in most cases, may increase the total
resource and energy consumption significantly. For many analytical workloads,
however, minimizing query latencies is often not critical; in such scenarios,
we argue that we should instead focus on minimizing the average query span,
i.e., the average number of machines that are involved in processing of a
query, through colocation of data items that are frequently accessed together.
In this work, we exploit the fact that most distributed environments need to
use replication for fault tolerance, and we devise workload-driven replica
selection and placement algorithms that attempt to minimize the average query
span. We model a historical query workload trace as a hypergraph over a set of
data items, and formulate and analyze the problem of replica placement by
drawing connections to several well-studied graph theoretic concepts. We
develop a series of algorithms to decide which data items to replicate, and
where to place the replicas. We show effectiveness of our proposed approach by
presenting results on a collection of synthetic and real workloads. Our
experiments show that careful data placement and replication can dramatically
reduce the average query spans resulting in significant reductions in the
resource consumption.

about 6.3 years. This analysis was made only from studying the periodic
modulation of the two periods, when during the periastron passage one binary
has an apparently shorter period, while the other one longer, exactly as
required by a theory. Additionally, it was found that both inner eclipsing
pairs orbit with slightly eccentric orbits undergoing a slow apsidal motions

formation. We also calculate protostellar evolution to derive protostellar
luminosity with time-dependent mass accretion through a circumstellar disk. The
protostellar outflow is driven by the first core prior to protostar formation
and is directly driven by the circumstellar disk after protostar formation. The
opening angle of the outflow is large in the Class 0 stage. A large fraction of
the cloud mass is ejected in this stage, which reduces the star formation
efficiency to \sim 50%. After the outflow breaks out from the natal cloud, the
outflow collimation is gradually improved in the Class I stage. The head of the
outflow travels more than \sim 10^5AU in \sim 10^5 yr. The outflow momentum,
energy and mass derived in our calculations agree well with observations. In
addition, our simulations show the same correlations among outflow momentum
flux, protostellar luminosity and envelope mass as those in observations. These
correlations differ between Class 0 and I stages, which is explained by
different evolutionary stages of the outflow; in the Class 0 stage, the outflow
is powered by the accreting mass and acquires its momentum from the infalling
envelope; in the Class I stage, the outflow enters the momentum-driven
snow-plough phase. Our results suggest that protostellar outflow should
determine the final stellar mass and significantly affect the early evolution

in an atomic orbital expands when a second electron occupies the orbital. These
models give rise to superconductivity driven by lowering of kinetic energy when
the electronic energy band is almost full, with higher transition temperatures
resulting when the ions are negatively charged. We show that the charge
distribution in dynamic Hubbard models can be highly inhomogeneous in the
presence of disorder, and that a finite system will expel {\it negative charge}
from the interior to the surface, and that these tendencies are largest in the
parameter regime where the models give rise to highest superconducting
transition temperatures. High $T_c$ cuprate materials exhibit charge
inhomogeneity and they exhibit tunneling asymmetry, a larger tendency to emit
electrons rather than holes in NIS tunnel junctions. We propose that these
properties, as well as their high $T_c$'s, are evidence that they are governed
by the physics described by dynamic Hubbard models. Below the superconducting
transition temperature the models considered here describe a negatively charged
superfluid and positively charged quasiparticles, unlike the situation in
conventional BCS superconductors where quasiparticles are charge neutral on
average. We examine the temperature dependence of the superfluid and
quasiparticle charges and conclude that spontaneous electric fields should be
observable in the interior and in the vicinity of superconducting materials
described by these models at sufficiently low temperatures. We furthermore
suggest that the dynamics of the negatively charged superfluid and positively

both the light p-nuclei and the heavy-p nuclei at a quite flat average
production factor. For the first time, the very abundant Ru and Mo p-isotopes
are reproduced at the same level as the heavy p-nuclei. We investigate the
metallicity effect on the p-process production. Starting with a range of
s-seeds distributions obtained for different metallicities, running SNIa
two-dimensional models and using a simple chemical evolution code, we give
estimates of the SNIa contribution to the solar p-process composition. We find
that SNIa contribute for at least 50% at the solar p-nuclei composition, in a
primary way.

shows that Bell's inequalities can be violated with a theory of local random
variables if one accepts that the outcomes of these variables are not
predetermined prior to measurement. The article describes the relation between
Bell's theorem and the Strong Free Will theorem of Conway and Kochen. Then, the
original articles of Bell are analyzed in detail. Following an article of
Faris, it is explained that Bell's work on the hidden variable question in fact
describes two separate theorems. Bell's first theorem says that there can be no
model for the singlet state where an outcome does not depend locally on the
settings of the detector where the outcome was measured. Bell's second theorem
shows that Bell's inequalities can be violated by a theory that is either not
deterministic, or violates causality in the sense of relativity or the free
will assumption of the experimenters. It is shown in detail where Bell
implicitly makes the various locality assumptions that Nelson has shown to be
necessary for deriving Bell's inequality. The article closes by relating the
various assumptions needed to derive Bell's theorem with the reality criterion
of EPR

in the jet/wind structure of the driving source and time variable mass
accretion probed by optical emission lines. This may allow us to constrain the
understanding of the jet/wind launching mechanism, the location of the
launching region, and the physical link with magnetospheric mass accretion. In
2010, observations were made at six different epochs to investigate how daily
and monthly variability might affect such a study. We perform comparisons
between the line profiles we observed and those in the literature over a period
of decades and confirm the presence of time variability separate from the daily
and monthly variability during our observations. This is so far consistent with
the idea that these line profiles have a long term variability (3-20 years)
related to episodic mass ejection suggested by the structures in the extended
flow components. We also investigate the correlations between equivalent widths
and between luminosities for different lines. We find that these correlations
are consistent with the present paradigm of steady magnetospheric mass
accretion and emission line regions that are close to the star.

cosmological vector mode perturbations in the primordial plasma. The vector
mode, however, has only a decaying solution in General Relativity if the plasma
consists of perfect fluids. In order to investigate a possible mechanism of
magnetogenesis in the primordial plasma, here we consider cosmological
perturbations in the Einstein-Aether gravity model, in which the aether field
can act as a new source of vector metric perturbations and thus of magnetic
fields. We estimate the angular power spectra of temperature and B-mode
polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Anisotropies in this
model and put a rough constraint on the aether field parameters from latest
observations. We then estimate the power spectrum of associated magnetic fields
around the recombination epoch within this limit. It is found that the spectrum
has a characteristic peak at $k=0.1 h{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$, and at that scale the
amplitude can be as large as $B\sim 10^{-22}$ Gauss where the upper bound comes
from CMB temperature anisotropies. The magnetic fields with this amplitude can
be seeds of large scale magnetic fields observed today if the sufficient dynamo
mechanism takes place. Analytic interpretation for the power spectra is also
given.

stellar spin axes are randomly orientated and that cool starspots have a
characteristic scale length and are randomly distributed across the stellar
surfaces. The model is compared with observational data for highly magnetically
active M-dwarfs in the young cluster NGC 2516. We find that the best fitting
starspot scale length is not constrained by these data alone, but requires
assumptions about the overall starspot filling factor and starspot temperature.
Assuming a spot coverage fraction of 0.4+/-0.1 and a starspot to unspotted
photosphere temperature ratio of 0.7+/-0.05, as suggested by the inflated radii
of these stars compared to evolutionary model predictions and by TiO band
measurements on other active cool stars of earlier spectral type, the
best-fitting starspot angular scale length is 3.5(+2)(-1) degrees, or a linear
scale length of \sim 25000 km. This linear scale length is similar to large
sunspot groups, but 2--5 times smaller than the starspots recently deduced on
an active G-dwarf using eclipse mapping by a transiting exoplanet. However, the
best-fitting spot scale length in the NGC 2516 M-dwarfs increases with the
assumed spot temperature ratio and with the inverse square root of the assumed
spot filling factor. Hence the light curve amplitude distribution might equally
well be described by these larger spot scale lengths if the spot filling
factors are <0.1 or the spot temperature ratio is >0.9.

odds with the underlying linearity of quantum mechanics. We show how it can
emerge in a simple way from the underlying microscopic quantum world governed
by Schrodinger's equation without the need for observers or their brains. In
order to achieve this, we assemble pieces of various pre-existing ideas.
Firstly, we adopt a relational approach and use the eigenvectors of the reduced
density matrix of a quantum sub-system, or equivalently the Schmidt
decomposition, to define the `internal state' of a sub-system. Previous work
has identified serious objections to such an interpretation because it
apparently leads to macroscopic superpositions and physically unacceptable
instabilities near degeneracies. We show that both these problems are solved if
the sub-system consists of a large number of coarse grained degrees of freedom
as one expects in order to make contact with the classical world. We further
argue that coarse graining is a necessary ingredient because measuring devices
have both finite spatial and temporal resolutions. What results is an
interpretation in which both decoherence and coarse graining play key roles and
from which the rules of the Copenhagen interpretation are seen to emerge in
realistic situations that include the measurement of the position of a particle
and a decay process.

The LES model cannot lead to spontaneous mirror symmetry breaking (SMSB) either
in closed systems with a homogeneous temperature distribution nor in closed
systems with a stationary non-uniform temperature distribution. However,
simulations of chemical kinetics in a two-compartment model demonstrate that
SMSB may occur if both autocatalytic reactions are spatially separated at
different temperatures in different compartments but coupled under the action
of a continous internal flow. In such conditions the system can evolve, for
certain reaction and system parameters, towards a chiral stationary state,
i.e., the system is able to reach a bifurcation point leading to SMSB.
Numerical simulations using reasonable chemical parameters suggest that an
adequate scenario for such a SMSB would be that of abyssal hydrothermal vents,
by virtue of the typical temperature gradients found there and the role of
inorganic solids mediating chemical reactions in an enzyme-like role.

rest of the solar system planets has become of the utmost importance for the
future characterization of rocky exoplanets. As this is not only interesting at
present times but also along the planetary evolution, we studied the effect
that the evolution of microbial mats and plants over land has had on the way
our planet looks from afar. As life evolved, continental surfaces changed
gradually and non- uniformly from deserts through microbial mats to land
plants, modifying the reflective properties of the ground and most probably the
distribution of moisture and cloudiness. Here, we used a radiative transfer
model of the Earth, together with geological paleo-records of the continental
distribution and a reconstructed cloud distribution, to simulate the visible
and near-IR radiation reflected by our planet as a function of Earth's
rotation. We found that the evolution from deserts to microbial mats and to
land plants produces detectable changes in the globally-averaged Earth's
reflectance. The variability of each surface type is located in different bands
and can induce reflectance changes of up to 40% in period of hours. We conclude
that using photometric observations of an Earth- like planet at different
photometric bands, it would be possible to discriminate between different
surface types. While recent literature proposes the red edge feature of
vegetation near 0.7 {\mu}m as a signature for land plants, observations in
near-IR bands can be equally or even better suited for this purpose.

important in view of the magnetic anisotropy of the molecule. The measured
X-ray magnetic circular dichroism shows a strong dependence on the photon
incidence angle, which we could relate to a huge value of $7< T_z>$, e.g. on

reduction of the effective spin moment $m_s + 7< T_z>$. Calculations have also
been performed to study the influence of possible ligands such as Cl and O
atoms on the magnetic properties of the molecule and the interaction between
molecule and surface, because the experimental spectra display a clear
dependence on the ligand, which is used to stabilize the molecule in the gas
phase. Both types of ligands weaken the hybridization between surface and

common belief that the very concept of ""ray trajectory"" is reserved to the

reducing to the eikonal approximation in the absence of Wave Potential, shows
that its presence induces a mutual, perpendicular ray-coupling, which is the
one and only cause of any typically wave-like phenomenon, such as diffraction
and interference. Recalling, then, that the time-independent Schroedinger and
Klein-Gordon equations (associating stationary ""matter waves"" to mono-energetic
particles) are themselves Helmholtz-like equations, the exact, ray-based
treatment developed for classical electromagnetic waves is extended - without
resorting to statistical concepts - to the exact, trajectory-based Hamiltonian
dynamics of mono-energetic point-like particles, both in the non-relativistic

coupled, once more, by an exact, stationary, energy-dependent Wave Potential,
coinciding in the form, but not in the physical meaning, with the statistical,
time-varying, energy-independent ""Quantum Potential"" of Bohm's theory, which
views particles, just like the standard Copenhagen interpretation, as traveling
wave-packets. These results, together with the connection which is shown to
exist between Wave Potential and Uncertainty Principle, suggest a novel,

of deep optical imaging of 22 AGB stars with high mass loss rates: 16 with the
ESO 3.5 m NTT telescope, and the remainder with other telescopes. The
circumstellar envelopes are detected in 15 objects, with mass loss rates > 2E-6
Msun/year. The surface brightness of the envelopes shows a strong decrease with
Galactic radius, which indicates a steep radial gradient in the interstellar
radiation field. The envelopes range from circular to elliptical in shape, and
we characterize them by the ellipticity (E = major/minor axis) of iso-intensity
contours. We find that about 50 percent of the envelopes are close to circular
with E < 1.1, and others are more elliptical with about 20 percent with E >
1.2. We interpret the shapes in terms of populations of single stars and
binaries whose envelopes are flattened by a companion. The distribution of E is
qualitatively consistent with expectations based on population synthesis models
of binary AGB stars. We also find that about 50 percent of the sample exhibit
small-scale, elongated features in the central regions. We interpret these as
the escape of light from the central star through polar holes, which are also
likely produced by companions. Our observations of envelope flattening and
polar holes point to a hidden population of companions within the circumstellar
envelopes of AGB stars. These companions are expected to play an important role
in the transition to post-AGB stars and the formation of planetary nebulae.

organization: sparseness, in which only a small fraction of possible
interactions between components actually occur; and modularity - the near
decomposability of the system into modules with distinct functionality. Recent
work suggests that modularity can evolve in a variety of circumstances,
including goals that vary in time such that they share the same subgoals
(modularly varying goals), or when connections are costly. Here, we studied the
origin of modularity and sparseness focusing on the nature of the mutation
process, rather than on connection cost or variations in the goal. We use
simulations of evolution with different mutation rules. We found that commonly
used sum-rule mutations, in which interactions are mutated by adding random
numbers, do not lead to modularity or sparseness except for in special
situations. In contrast, product-rule mutations in which interactions are
mutated by multiplying by random numbers - a better model for the effects of
biological mutations - led to sparseness naturally. When the goals of evolution
are modular, in the sense that specific groups of inputs affect specific groups
of outputs, product-rule mutations also lead to modular structure; sum-rule
mutations do not. Product-rule mutations generate sparseness and modularity
because they tend to reduce interactions, and to keep small interaction terms
small.

FIR/sub-mm detections from $Herschel$-ATLAS; and a visually classified sample
of 551 ETGs which are undetected with $Herschel$-ATLAS. Active galactic nuclei
(AGN) are removed from our samples using optical emission line diagnostics.
These samples are scrutinised to determine characteristics of sub-mm detected
versus undetected ETGs. We find similarities in the stellar mass distributions
of the two ETG samples but testing other properties uncovers significant
differences. The sub-mm detected sample is shown to have lower concentration
and S\'ersic indices than those in the undetected sample - a result which may
be linked to the presence of dust in the former. Optical and UV-optical colours
are also shown to be much bluer, indicating that the dust is linked with recent
star formation. The intrinsic effective radii are on average 1.5 times larger
for the sub-mm detected ETGs. Surface densities and groups data from the GAMA
database are examined for the two samples, leading to the conclusion that dusty
ETGs inhabit sparser environments than non-dusty ETGs in the nearby universe,
although environments of the brightest ETGs are shown to differ the least.
Modified Planck functions are fit to the H-ATLAS detected PACS and SPIRE fluxes
for ETGs with sub-mm flux densities of at least 3$\sigma$ in the 350$\mu$m
SPIRE band, giving a resultant mean cold dust temperature of T$_{d}$=22.1K,
with a range of 9-30K. The corresponding mean dust mass is
1.8$\times10^{7}$M$_{\odot}$, with a range of
(0.08-35.0)$\times10^{7}$M$_{\odot}$. The dust masses calculated from these
fits, normalised by stellar mass, are shown to increase with decreasing stellar
mass and bluer colours.

of radio-pure germanium material to cosmic radiation resulting in a significant
suppression of cosmogenic activation in the germanium detectors. The project
has been strongly motivated by a special production of germanium detectors for
the GERDA experiment. GERDA, currently collecting data at the Laboratori
Nazionali del Gran Sasso of INFN, is searching for the neutrinoless double beta
decay of 76Ge. In the near future, GERDA will increase its mass and sensitivity
by adding new Broad Energy Germanium (BEGe) detectors. The production of the
BEGe detectors is done at Canberra in Olen (Belgium), located about 30km from
the underground test site. Therefore, HADES is used both for storage of the
crystals over night, during diode production, and for the characterization
measurements. A full quality control chain has been setup and tested on the
first seven prototype detectors delivered by the manufacturer at the beginning
of 2012. The screening capabilities demonstrate that the installed setup
fulfills a fast and complete set of measurements on the diodes and it can be
seen as a general test facility for the fast screening of high purity germanium
detectors. The results are of major importance for a future massive production

sequences of ordinary conformal field theories with varying central charge c.
Logarithmic behaviour arises from degeneracies in the spectrum of scaling
dimensions at certain values of c. The theories we consider are all invariant
under some internal symmetry group, and logarithmic behaviour occurs when the
decomposition of the physical observables into irreducible operators becomes
singular. Examples considered are quenched random magnets using the replica
formalism, self-avoiding walks as the n->0 of the O(n) model, and percolation
as the limit Q->1 of the Potts model. In these cases we identify logarithmic
operators and pay particular attention to how the c->0 paradox is resolved and
how the b-parameter is evaluated. We also show how this approach gives
information on logarithmic behaviour in the extended Ising model, uniform
spanning trees and the O(-2) model. Most of our results apply to general
dimensionality. We also consider massive logarithmic theories and, in two
dimensions, derive sum rules for the effective central charge and the
b-parameter.

$\alpha_s$ at a $e^+ e^-$ collider with the collision energy around the $Z^0$
peak. Quarkonia are produced through the semi-exclusive channels $e^{+}e^{-}
\rightarrow |H_{Q\bar{Q}}\rangle +X$ with $X=Q\bar{Q}$ or $gg$, where $Q$
indicates a heavy quark (respectively $b$ or $c$). It is noted that in addition
to the color-singlet 1S-level quarkonium states, the 2S and 1P color-singlet
states and the color-octet $|(Q\bar{Q})[1^3S_1^{({\bf 8})}]g\rangle$ state also
provide sizable contributions. The heavy quarkonium transverse momentum and
rapidity distributions for the $e^+ e^-$ collision energy $E_{cm}=m_Z$ are
presented. For both charmonium and bottomonium production via the $Z^0$
propagator, there is approximate ""spin degeneracy"" between the spin-triplet and
spin-singlet quarkonium states. Uncertainties for the total cross sections are
estimated by taking $m_c=1.50\pm0.15$ GeV and $m_b=4.90\pm0.15$ GeV. Around
$E_{cm}=m_{Z}$, due to the $Z^0$-boson resonance effect, total cross sections
for the channels via the $Z^0$-propagator become much larger than the channels
via the virtual photon propagator. We conclude that, in addition to the $B$
factories as BaBar and Belle and the hadronic colliders as Tevatron and LHC,
such a super $Z$-factory will present an excellent platform for studying the
heavy quarkonium properties.

  MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stt399",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Comparisons of the integrated thermal pressure support of gas against its
gravitational potential energy lead to critical mass scales for gravitational
instability such as the Jeans and the Bonnor-Ebert masses, which play an
important role in analysis of many physical systems, including the heuristics
of numerical simulations. In a strict theoretical sense, however, neither the
Jeans nor the Bonnor-Ebert mass are meaningful when applied locally to
substructure in a self-gravitating turbulent medium. For this reason, we
investigate the local support by thermal pressure, turbulence, and magnetic
fields against gravitational compression through an approach that is
independent of these concepts. At the centre of our approach is the dynamical
equation for the divergence of the velocity field. We carry out a statistical
analysis of the source terms of the local compression rate (the negative time
derivative of the divergence) for simulations of forced self-gravitating
turbulence in periodic boxes with zero, weak, and moderately strong mean
magnetic fields (measured by the averages of the magnetic and thermal
pressures). We also consider the amplification of the magnetic field energy by
shear and by compression. Thereby, we are able to demonstrate that the support
against gravity is dominated by thermal pressure fluctuations, although
magnetic pressure also yields a significant contribution. The net effect of
turbulence in the highly supersonic regime, however, is to enhance compression
rather than supporting overdense gas even if the vorticity is very high. This
is incommensurate with the support of the highly dynamical substructures in
magneto-turbulent fluids being determined by local virial equilibria of volume
energies without surface stresses.

different spins are the main concepts of the molecular theory of graphene. In
contrast to the theory of aromaticity, the molecular theory is based on the
fact that odd electrons with different spins occupy different places in the
space so that the configuration interaction becomes the central point of the
theory. Consequently, a multi-determinant presentation of the wave function of
the system of weakly interacting odd electrons is absolutely mandatory on the
way of the theory realization at the computational level. However, the efficacy
of the available CI computational techniques is quite restricted in regards
large polyatomic systems, which does not allow performing extensive
computational experiments. Facing the problem, computationists have addressed
to standard single-determinant ones albeit not often being aware of how correct
are the obtained results. The current chapter presents the molecular theory of
graphene in terms of single-determinant computational schemes and discloses how
reliable information about electron-correlated system can be obtained by using
either UHF or UDFT computational schemes.

ends, the isocurvature is negligible for the double quadratic and double

features large isocurvature at the end of inflation, the isocurvature decays
during reheating and is around five orders of magnitudes smaller than the

contact lines, or cracks proceed via intermittent motion, called avalanches. We
develop a field-theoretic treatment to calculate, from first principles, the
space-time statistics of instantaneous velocities within an avalanche. For
elastic interfaces at (or above) their (internal) upper critical dimension d >=
d_uc (d_uc = 2, 4 respectively for long-ranged and short-ranged elasticity) we
show that the field theory for the center of mass reduces to the motion of a
point particle in a random-force landscape, which is itself a random walk (ABBM
model). Furthermore, the full spatial dependence of the velocity correlations
is described by the Brownian-force model (BFM) where each point of the
interface sees an independent Brownian-force landscape. Both ABBM and BFM can
be solved exactly in any dimension d (for monotonous driving) by summing tree
graphs, equivalent to solving a (non-linear) instanton equation. This tree
approximation is the mean-field theory (MFT) for realistic interfaces in
short-ranged disorder. Both for the center of mass, and for a given Fourier
mode q, we obtain probability distribution functions (PDF's) of the velocity,
as well as the avalanche shape and its fluctuations (second shape). Within MFT
we find that velocity correlations at non-zero q are asymmetric under time
reversal. Next we calculate, beyond MFT, i.e. including loop corrections, the
1-time PDF of the center-of-mass velocity du/dt for dimension d< d_uc. The
singularity at small velocity P(du/dt) ~ 1/(du/dt)^a is substantially reduced
from a=1 (MFT) to a = 1 - 2/9 (4-d) + ... (short-ranged elasticity) and a = 1 -
4/9 (2-d) + ... (long-ranged elasticity). We show how the dynamical theory
recovers the avalanche-size distribution, and how the instanton relates to the
response to an infinitesimal step in the force.

reaches $\sim$2 ms$^{-1}$. This level of precision means that RV models have to
take into account additional non-Keplerian effects such as tidal and rotational
distortion of the components of a binary star, relativistic effects and orbital
precession.
  We generate synthetic binaries using Yonsei-Yale stellar models. For typical
representatives we investigate the impact of various orbital orientations and
different non-Keplerian effects on the RV curves. To this end we simulate RV
observations with an added white noise of different scale. Subsequently we try
to reconstruct the input orbital parameters and their errors by fitting a model
using a standard least-squares method. In particular we investigate the
connection between the tidal distortion of the shape of the stars and the
best-fit orbital eccentricity, the possibility of deriving orbital inclination
of a non-eclipsing binary star by exploiting relativistic effects and the
circumstances in which the orbital precession can be detected.
  We confirm that the method proposed by to obtain orbital inclination with use
of the relativistic effect does work in favourable cases and that it can be
used even for orbital configurations far from an edge-on orientation. We show
that the RV variations imposed by tidally distorted stars can mimic non-zero
eccentricity in some binaries. The scale of such an effect depends on the RV
accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate that the apsidal precession can be easily
detected with precision RVs. In particular we can detect orbital precession of
$10^{-4}$ rad yr$^{-1}$, $10^{-3}$ rad yr$^{-1}$ for precision of RVs of 1
ms$^{-1}$ and 10 ms$^{-1}$ respectively.

spatial populations due to the linear rather than exponential growth of clones.
Recent theoretical studies have pointed out that the resulting fitness dynamics
is analogous to a surface growth process, where new layers nucleate and spread
stochastically, leading to the build up of scale-invariant roughness. This
scenario differs qualitatively from the standard view of adaptation in that the
speed of adaptation becomes independent of population size while the fitness
variance does not. Here we exploit recent progress in the understanding of
surface growth processes to obtain precise predictions for the universal,
non-Gaussian shape of the fitness distribution for one-dimensional habitats,
which are verified by simulations. When the mutations are deleterious rather
than beneficial the problem becomes a spatial version of Muller's ratchet. In
contrast to the case of well-mixed populations, the rate of fitness decline
remains finite even in the limit of an infinite habitat, provided the ratio
$U_d/s^2$ between the deleterious mutation rate and the square of the
(negative) selection coefficient is sufficiently large. Using again an analogy
to surface growth models we show that the transition between the stationary and

product of powers of the norm of $V$, the measure of $D$, and a sharp Sobolev
constant. In most cases, these inequalities are best possible. Applications to
non-linear eigenvalue problems are also discussed.

  arXiv:1302.4130",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive reduced-rank strategy for very
large multiuser multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems. The proposed
reduced-rank scheme is based on the concept of joint iterative optimization
(JIO) of filters according to the minimization of the bit error rate (BER) cost
function. The proposed optimization technique adjusts the weights of a
projection matrix and a reduced-rank filter jointly. We develop stochastic
gradient (SG) algorithms for their adaptive implementation and introduce a
novel automatic rank selection method based on the BER criterion. Simulation
results for multiuser MIMO systems show that the proposed adaptive algorithms
significantly outperform existing schemes.

other fields. The problems in these areas can be solved reducing differential

Teams play a
number of games within their divisions and fewer games against teams in
different divisions and conferences. Usually, a league structure remains stable
from one season to the next. However, structures change when growth or
contraction occurs, and realignment of the four major professional sports
leagues in North America has occurred more than twenty-five times since 1967.
In this paper, we describe a method for realigning sports leagues that is
flexible, adaptive, and that enables construction of schedules that minimize
travel while satisfying other criteria. We do not build schedules; we develop
league structures which support the subsequent construction of efficient
schedules. Our initial focus is the NHL, which has an urgent need for
realignment following the recent move of the Atlanta Thrashers to Winnipeg, but
our methods can be adapted to virtually any situation. We examine a variety of
scenarios for the NHL, and apply our methods to the NBA, MLB, and NFL. We find
the biggest improvements for MLB and the NFL, where adopting the best solutions
would reduce league travel by about 20%.

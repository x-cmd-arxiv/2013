charge, so-called non-congruent PTs, have characteristic differences compared
to congruent PTs (e.g., dimensionality of phase diagrams, location and
properties of critical points and endpoints). In the present article we
investigate the non-congruence of the nuclear liquid-gas PT at sub-saturation
densities and the deconfinement PT at high densities and/or temperatures in
Coulomb-less models, relevant for heavy-ion collisions and neutron stars. For
the first PT, we use the FSUgold relativistic mean-field model and for the
second one the relativistic chiral SU(3) model. The chiral SU(3) model is one
of the few models for the deconfinement PT, which contains quarks and hadrons
in arbitrary proportions (i.e. a ""solution"") and gives a continuous transition
from pure hadronic to pure quark matter above a critical point. The study shows
the universality of the applied concept of non-congruence for the two PTs with
an upper critical point, and illustrates the different typical scales involved.
In addition, we find a principle difference between the liquid-gas and the
deconfinement PTs: in contrast to the ordinary Van-der-Waals-like PT, the phase
coexistence line of the deconfinement PT has a negative slope in the
pressure-temperature plane. As another qualitative difference we find that the
non-congruent features of the deconfinement PT become vanishingly small around
the critical point.

understanding of its complex atomistic origin has been a remaining challenge.
We report an investigation of the thermodynamics of such surfaces at the atomic

a parameterization of previous ab initio results and successfully describes the

This behavior is explained by a synergy between (i) the complex phase
separation in the bulk alloy, (ii) local phase transitions that tune the layers
closest to the surface to an iron-rich state and inhibit the bulk phase
separation in this region, and (iii) its compensation by a strong and
non-linear enrichment in Cr of the next few layers. Implications with respect

technological applications is often limited by their toughness, which is
defined as the area under the stress vs. strain curve before plastic yielding.
Recently toughness was found to increase significantly by the addition of small
concentrations of foreign atoms that act as pinning centers. We model this
phenomenon at zero temperature and quasi-static straining with randomly
positioned particles that participate in the elastic deformation but are pinned
in the non-affine return to mechanical equilibrium. We find a very strong
effect on toughness via the increase of both the shear modulus and the yield
stress as a function of the density of pinned particles. Understanding the
results calls for analyzing separately the elastic, or ""Born term"" and the
contributions of the ""excess modes"" that result from glassy disorder. Finally
we present a scaling theory that collapses the data on one universal curve as a
function of rescaled variables.

quantum states is limited by quantum inequalities, which take the form of an
inverse relation between the magnitude and duration of the negative energy. The
quantum inequalities severely limit the utilization of negative energy to
produce gross macroscopic effects, such as violations of the second law of
thermodynamics. The restrictions on the sampled energy density along the
worldlines of accelerated observers are much weaker than for inertial
observers. Here we will illustrate this with several explicit examples. We
consider the worldline of a particle undergoing sinusoidal motion in space in
the presence of a single mode squeezed vacuum state of the electromagnetic
field. We show that it is possible for the integrated energy density along such
a worldline to become arbitrarily negative at a constant average rate. Thus the
averaged weak energy condition is violated in these examples.This can be the
case even when the particle moves at non-relativistic speeds. We use the
Raychaudhuri equation to show that there can be net defocussing of a congruence
of these accelerated worldlines. This defocussing is an operational signature
of the negative integrated energy density. These results in no way invalidate
nor undermine either the validity or utility of the quantum inequalities for
inertial observers. In particular, they do not change previous constraints on
the production of macroscopic effects with negative energy, e.g., the
maintenance of traversable wormholes.

are studied before, during and after the peak X-ray emission. Using
observations from the Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI),
we deduce the temporal changes in emitting X-ray length, corpulence, volume,
position, number density and thermal pressure. We observe a decrease in the
loop length, width and volume before the X-ray peak, and an increasing number
density and thermal pressure. After the X-ray peak, volume increases and loop
corpulence grows due to an increasing width. The volume variations are more
pronounced than the position variations, often known as magnetic line
contraction. We believe this is the first dedicated study of the temporal
evolution of X-ray loop lengths and widths. Collectively, the observations also
show for the first time three temporal phases given by peaks in temperature,
X-ray emission and thermal pressure, with minimum volume coinciding with the
X-ray peak. Although the volume of the flaring plasma decreases before the peak
in X-ray emission, the relationship between temperature and volume does not
support simple compressive heating in a collapsing magnetic trap model. Within
a low beta plasma, shrinking loop widths perpendicular to the guiding field can
be explained by squeezing the magnetic field threading the region. Plasma
heating leads to chromospheric evaporation and growing number density,
producing increasing thermal pressure and decreasing loop lengths as electrons
interact at shorter distances and we believe after the X-ray peak, the
increasing loop corpulence.

dispersion and comparing them to higher mass/lower redshift analogs is
important to understand how the AGN formation process is related to
environmental properties. We use our well-tested cluster finding algorithm to
identify structures in the GOODS North and South fields, exploiting the
available spectroscopic redshifts and accurate photometric redshifts. We
identify 9 structures in GOODS-south (presented in a previous paper) and 8 new
structures in GOODS-north. We only consider structures where at least 2/3 of
the members brighter than M_R=-20 have a spectroscopic redshift. For those
group members that coincide with X-ray sources in the 4 and 2 Msec Chandra
source catalogs respectively, we determine if the X-ray emission originates
from AGN activity or it is related to the galaxies' star-formation activity. We
find that the fraction of AGN with Log L_H > 42 erg/s in galaxies with M_R <
-20 is on average 6.3+-1.3%, much higher than in lower redshift groups of
similar mass and more than double the fraction found in massive clusters at a
similarly high redshift. We then explore the spatial distribution of AGN in the
structures and find that they preferentially populate the outer regions. The
colors of AGN host galaxies in structures tend to be confined to the green
valley, thus avoiding the blue cloud and, partially, also the red-sequence,
contrary to what happens in the field. We finally compare our results to the
predictions of two sets of semi analytic models to investigate the evolution of
AGN and evaluate potential triggering and fueling mechanisms. The outcome of
this comparison attests the importance of galaxy encounters, not necessarily
leading to mergers, as an efficient AGN triggering mechanism. (abridged)

the quasi-one dimensional case to an anisotropic XY chain we show that the

critical temperature and leads to a peculiar behavior of matter, with
frictionless flow, the formation of quantized vortices, and the quenching of
the moment of inertia being intriguing examples. A remarkable explanation for
many phenomena exhibited by a superfluid at finite temperature can be given in
terms of a two-fluid mixture comprised of a normal component that behaves like
a usual fluid and a superfluid component with zero viscosity and zero entropy.
Important examples of superfluid systems are liquid helium and neutron stars.
More recently, ultracold atomic gases have emerged as new superfluid systems
with unprecedented possibilities to control interactions and external
confinement. Here we report the first observation of `second sound' in an
ultracold Fermi gas with resonant interactions. Second sound is a striking
manifestation of the two-component nature of a superfluid and corresponds to an
entropy wave, where the superfluid and the non-superfluid components oscillate
in opposite phase, different from ordinary sound (`first sound'), where they
oscillate in phase. The speed of second sound depends explicitly on the value
of the superfluid fraction, a quantity sensitive to the spectrum of elementary
excitations. Our measurements allow us to extract the temperature dependence of
the superfluid fraction, which in strongly interacting quantum gases has been
an inaccessible quantity so far.

information transmission over such systems is revisited. Among numerous

the achievable rate at high launch power. However, this distortion and similar
ones arising from nonlinearity are primarily due to the use of methods suited
for linear systems, namely WDM and linear pulse-train transmission, for the
nonlinear optical channel. Exploiting the integrability of the nonlinear
Schr\""odinger (NLS) equation, a nonlinear frequency-division multiplexing
(NFDM) scheme is presented, which directly modulates non-interacting signal
degrees-of-freedom under NLS propagation. The main distinction between this and
previous methods is that NFDM is able to cope with the nonlinearity, and thus,
as the the signal power or transmission distance is increased, the new method
does not suffer from the deterministic cross-talk between signal components
which has degraded the performance of previous approaches. In this paper,
emphasis is placed on modulation of the discrete component of the nonlinear
Fourier transform of the signal and some simple examples of achievable spectral
efficiencies are provided.

Results of numerical simulations for relatively short chains reveal an
interesting new feature of the network. When the current through the system
takes its maximum value, a simple translation of the double-chain section
forward or backward along the network, leads to a sharp change in the shape of
the density profiles in the parallel chains, thus affecting the total number of
cars in that part of the network. In the symmetric case of equal injection and
ejection rates (\alpha = \beta >1/2) and equal lengths of the head and tail
sections, the density profiles in the two parallel chains are almost linear,
characteristic for the coexistence line (shock phase). Upon moving the section
forward (backward), their shape changes to the one typical for the high (low)
density phases of a simple chain. The total bulk density of cars in a section
with a large number of parallel chains is evaluated too. The observed effect
might have interesting implications for the traffic flow control as well as for
biological transport processes in living cells. An explanation of this
phenomenon is offered in terms of finite-size dependence of the effective
injection and ejection rates at the ends of the double-chain section.

an important physical aspect that, however, is often neglected in practical
applications by adopting the simplifying approximation of complete
redistribution on velocity. In this paper, we present an application of the
Non-LTE problem for polarized radiation taking such correlations into account
through the velocity-space density matrix formalism. We consider a two-level
atom with infinitely sharp upper and lower levels, and we derive the
corresponding statistical equilibrium equations neglecting the contribution of
velocity-changing collisions. Coupling such equations with the radiative
transfer equations for polarized radiation, we derive a set of coupled
equations for the velocity-dependent source function. This set of equations is
then particularized to the case of a plane-parallel atmosphere. The equations
presented in this paper provide a complete and solid description of the physics
of pure Doppler redistribution, a phenomenon generally described within the
framework of the redistribution matrix formalism. The redistribution matrix
corresponding to this problem (generally referred to as R_I) is derived
starting from the statistical equilibrium equations for the velocity-space
density matrix and from the radiative transfer equations for polarized
radiation, thus showing the equivalence of the two approaches.

one of the most promising approaches to scalable quantum computers. However, it
faces problems such as initializing the spins, selectively addressing and
manipulating single spins, and reading out the state of the individual spins.
We have recently sketched a scheme that potentially solves all of these
problems5. This is achieved by making use of a unique phosphorus-doped 28Si
sample (28Si:P), and applying powerful new electron spin resonance (ESR)
techniques for parallel excitation, detection, and imaging in order to
implement QCs and efficiently obtain their results. The beauty of our proposed
scheme is that, contrary to other approaches, single-spin detection sensitivity
is not required and a capability to measure signals of ~100-1000 spins is
sufficient to implement it. Here we take the first experimental step towards
the actual implementation of such scheme. We show that, by making use of the
smallest ESR resonator constructed to date (~5 microns), together with a unique
cryogenic amplification scheme and sub-micron imaging capabilities, a
sensitivity of less than 1000 electron spin is obtained with spatial resolution
of ~500 nm. This is the most sensitive induction-detection experiment carried
out to date, and such capabilities put this approach on the fast track to the
demonstration of a scalable QC capability.

associated with an extra Abelian gauge group. In this study, we explore the
potential effects of such a boson with family-nonuniversal couplings on the

lepton magnetic dipole moments. Adopting a model-independent approach and
assuming that the Z' has negligible mixing with the Z boson, we find that
present data allow the Z' effects to reach a few percent or higher on h decays
into a pair of leptons. Future measurements on h at the LHC or a linear
collider can therefore detect the Z' contributions or impose further
constraints on its couplings. We also consider Z'-mediated four-lepton decays

relation between the transition temperature and the stiffness, $\rho_s(T_{\rm

$T_{\rm BKT}(L_1,L_2)$ based on a pair of system sizes $L_1,L_2$, e.g.,
$L_2=2L_1$. We use Monte Carlo data for the standard two-dimensional classical
XY model to demonstrate that this quantity is well behaved and can be reliably
extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit using the next expected logarithmic
correction beyond the ones included in defining $T_{\rm BKT}(L_1,L_2)$. For the
Monte Carlo calculations we use GPU (graphical processing unit) computing to
obtain high-precision data for $L$ up to 512. We find that the sub-leading
logarithmic corrections have significant effects on the extrapolation. Our
result $T_{\rm BKT}=0.8935(1)$ is several error bars above the previously best
estimates of the transition temperature; $T_{\rm BKT} \approx 0.8929$. If only
the leading log-correction is used, the result is, however, consistent with the
lower value, suggesting that previous works have underestimated $T_{\rm BKT}$
because of neglect of sub-leading logarithms. Our method is easy to implement
in practice and should be applicable to generic BKT transitions.

evolution on rugged genetic fitness landscapes, and determine that peaks in

shallow and narrow, such that evolutionary trajectories towards the highest

find a gradual decline in the gas temperature from 5 keV around NGC4839 to 3.6
keV at the radio relic, across which there is a further, steeper drop down to
1.5 keV. This drop as well as the observed surface brightness profile are
consistent with a shock with Mach number M = 2.2 pm 0.5 and velocity vs = (1410
pm 110) km s^-1. A lower limit of B > 0.33 mu G is derived on the magnetic
field strength around the relic from upper limits to inverse Compton X-ray
emission. Although this suggests that the non-thermal electrons responsible for
the relic are generated by diffusive shock acceleration (DSA), the relation
between the measured Mach number and the electron spectrum inferred from radio
observations are inconsistent with that expected from the simplest,
test-particle theory of DSA. Nevertheless, DSA is still viable if it is
initiated by the injection of a pre-existing population of non-thermal
electrons. Combined with previous measurements, the temperature profile of Coma
in the southwest direction is shallower outside NGC4839 and also slightly
shallower in the outermost region. The metal abundance around NGC4839 is
confirmed to be higher than in its vicinity, implying a significant peak in the
abundance profile that decreases to 0.2 solar toward the outskirts. We
interpret these facts as due to ram pressure stripping of metal-enriched gas
from NGC4839 as it falls into Coma. The relic shock may result from the
combined interaction of pre-existing intracluster gas, gas associated with NGC
4839, and cooler gas flowing in from the large-scale structure filament in the

four redshift bins between z=0.04 and z=1.6, using data from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS) and the NEWFIRM Medium Band Survey (NMBS). We measure the
projected radial distribution of galaxies in cylinders around a constant number
density selected sample of massive galaxies and utilize a statistical
subtraction of contaminating sources. Our analysis shows that massive primary
galaxies typically live in group halos and are surrounded by 2 to 3 satellites
with masses more than one-tenth of the primary galaxy mass. The cumulative
stellar mass in these satellites roughly equals the mass of the primary galaxy
itself. We further find that the radial number density profile of galaxies
around massive primaries has not evolved significantly in either slope or
overall normalization in the past 9.5 Gyr. A simplistic interpretation of this
result can be taken as evidence for a lack of mergers in the studied groups and
as support for a static evolution model of halos containing massive primaries.
Alternatively, there exists a tight balance between mergers and accretion of
new satellites such that the overall distribution of galaxies in and around the
halo is preserved. The latter interpretation is supported by a comparison to a
semi-analytic model, which shows a similar constant average satellite
distribution over the same redshift range.

significant progress during the last years in theory and observations. Violent
mergers of two carbon--oxygen (CO) white dwarfs (WDs) are one candidate
suggested to be responsible for at least a significant fraction of normal SNe
Ia. Here, we simulate the merger of two CO WDs using a moving-mesh code that
allows for the inclusion of thin helium (He) shells (0.01\,\msun) on top of the
WDs, at an unprecedented numerical resolution. The accretion of He onto the
primary WD leads to the formation of a detonation in its He shell. This
detonation propagates around the CO WD and sends a converging shock wave into
its core, known to robustly trigger a second detonation, as in the well-known
double-detonation scenario for
  He-accreting CO WDs. However, in contrast to that scenario where a massive He
shell is required to form a detonation through thermal instability, here the He
detonation is ignited dynamically. Accordingly the required He-shell mass is
significantly smaller, and hence its burning products are unlikely to affect
the optical display of the explosion. We show that this scenario, which works
for CO primary WDs with CO- as well as He-WD companions, has the potential to
explain the different brightness distributions, delay times and relative rates
of normal and fast declining SNe Ia. Finally, we discuss extensions to our
unified merger model needed to obtain a comprehensive picture of the full
observed diversity of SNe Ia.

very difficult to get a Higgs of mass lighter than $m_t$. Consequently, in
light of the LHC discovery of the ~125 GeV Higgs, such models face a
significant obstacle. Moreover, with three generations those models have a
superheavy cut-off around $10^{17}$ GeV, requiring a significant fine-tuning.
To overcome these twin difficulties, we propose a hybrid framework for EWSB, in
which the Higgs mechanism is combined with a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio mechanism. The
model introduces a strongly coupled doublet of heavy quarks with a mass around
500 GeV, which forms a condensate at a compositeness scale $\Lambda$ about a
few TeV, and an additional unconstrained scalar doublet which behaves as a
""fundamental"" doublet at $\Lambda$. This ""fundamental""-like doublet has a
vanishing quartic term at $\Lambda$ and is, therefore, not the SM doublet, but
should rather be viewed as a pseudo-Goldstone boson of the underlying strong
dynamics. This setup is matched at the compositeness scale $\Lambda$ to a
tightly constrained hybrid two Higgs doublet model, where both the composite
and unconstrained scalars participate in EWSB. This allows us to get a good
candidate for the recently observed 125 GeV scalar which has properties very
similar to the Standard Model Higgs. The heavier (mostly composite) CP-even
scalar has a mass around 500 GeV, while the pseudoscalar and the charged Higgs
particles have masses in the range 200 -300 GeV.

deducing the physical parameters of a system from the gravitational waves
alone. It is also used to define the corotating frame of the waveform. When

therefore as slowly evolving as possible. The resulting simplifications lead to

IR-AGN samples defined using the IRAC color selection of Stern et al. and
Donley et al. with X-ray detected AGN samples. For roughly similar depth IR and
X-ray surveys, we find that ~75% of IR-AGN are identified as X-ray AGN. This
fraction increases to ~90% when comparing against the deepest X-ray data,
indicating that only ~10% of IR-selected AGN may be heavily obscured. The
IR-AGN selection proposed by Stern et al. suffers from contamination by
star-forming galaxies at various redshifts when using deeper IR data, though
the selection technique works well for shallow IR data. While similar overall,
the IR-AGN samples preferentially contain more luminous AGN, while the X-ray
AGN samples preferentially contain lower specific accretion rate AGN, where the
host galaxy light dominates at IR wavelengths. The host galaxy populations of

By design, these systems possess negligible disorder, granting them a high

systems exist inside an imperfect host material, subjecting them to
uncontrollable, random disorder, which often destroys delicate correlated
phases and precludes local tunability. The realization of a condensed matter
system that is disorder-free and locally-tunable thus remains an outstanding
challenge. Here, we demonstrate a new technique for deterministic creation of
locally-tunable, ultra-low-disorder electron systems in carbon nanotubes
suspended over circuits of unprecedented complexity. Using transport
experiments we show that electrons can be localized at any position along the
nanotube and that the confinement potential can be smoothly moved from location
to location. Nearly perfect mirror symmetry of transport characteristics about
the centre of the nanotube establishes the negligible effects of electronic
disorder, thus allowing experiments in precision engineered one-dimensional
potentials. We further demonstrate the ability to position multiple nanotubes
at chosen separations, generalizing these devices to coupled one-dimensional
systems. These new capabilities open the door to a broad spectrum of new
experiments on electronics, mechanics, and spins in one dimension.

We propose that the modulation wall is a structure permeable to cosmic rays as
a result of a sectored magnetic field topology compressed by plasma slowdown on
approach to the heliopause and stretched to high latitudes by latitudinal flows
in the heliosheath. The tightly folded warped current sheet permits efficient
cosmic-ray transport in the radial direction via a drift-like mechanism. We
show that when stochastic variations in the sector widths are taken into
account, particle transport becomes predominantly diffusive both along and
across the magnetic sectors. Using a test-particle model for cosmic rays in the

properties of the sector structure and on particle energy.

electromagnetism and was required when the latter was formulated in terms of

principle of nature, stating that different forms of these potentials yield the
same physical description: they describe the same electromagnetic field as long
as they are related to each other by gauge transformations. Gauge invariance
can also be included into the quantum description of matter interacting with an
electromagnetic field by assuming that the wave function transforms under a
given local unitary transformation. The result of this procedure is a quantum
theory describing the coupling of electrons, nuclei and photons. Therefore, it
is a very important concept: it is used in almost every fields of physics and
it has been generalized to describe electroweak and strong interactions in the
standard model of particles. A review of quantum mechanical gauge invariance
and general unitary transformations is presented for atoms and molecules in
interaction with intense short laser pulses, spanning the perturbative to
highly nonlinear nonperturbative interaction regimes. Various unitary
transformations for single spinless particle Time Dependent Schr\""odinger
Equations, TDSE, are shown to correspond to different time-dependent
Hamiltonians and wave functions. Accuracy of approximation methods involved in
solutions of TDSE's such as perturbation theory and popular numerical methods
depend on gauge or representation choices which can be more convenient due to
faster convergence criteria. We focus on three main representations: length and
velocity gauges, in addition to the acceleration form which is not a gauge, to
describe perturbative and nonperturbative radiative interactions. Numerical
schemes for solving TDSE's in different representations are also discussed.

the noun-verb distinction (e.g., Straits Salish), whereas others have a
proliferation of fine-grained syntactic categories (e.g., Tzeltal); and some
languages do without morphology (e.g., Mandarin), while others pack a whole
sentence into a single word (e.g., Cayuga). A challenge for evolutionary
biology is to reconcile the diversity of languages with the high degree of
biological uniformity of their speakers. Here, we model processes of language
change and geographical dispersion and find a consistent pressure for flexible
learning, irrespective of the language being spoken. This pressure arises
because flexible learners can best cope with the observed high rates of
linguistic change associated with divergent cultural evolution following human
migration. Thus, rather than genetic adaptations for specific aspects of
language, such as recursion, the coevolution of genes and fast-changing
linguistic structure provides the biological basis for linguistic diversity.
Only biological adaptations for flexible learning combined with cultural
evolution can explain how each child has the potential to learn any human
language.

larger than measured radii of magnetically inactive M-dwarfs. The relative
radius difference is correlated with magnitude, increasing from a few per cent
at MI = 7 to greater than 50 per cent for the lowest luminosity stars in their

two-temperature star spot model is capable of explaining the observations, but
their model requires spot coverage fractions of at least 50 per cent in rapidly
rotating M-dwarfs. Here we examine these results in terms of stellar models
that include the inhibiting effects of magnetic fields on convective energy
transport, with and without the effects of star spots. We find that a pure spot
model is inconsistent with the color - magnitude diagram. The observations of
radii versus color and radii versus absolute magnitude in NGC 2516 are
consistent with models which include only magnetic inhibition or a combination
of magnetic inhibition and spots. At a given mass we find a large dispersion in

decreasing mass from a few hundred Gauss at 0.65 Msun to 600 - 900 Gauss,

elliptical and spiral galaxies with classical bulges cannot be in late single
activity event (be ""primordial""). Instead of it they have had events of
activity earlier in their evolution. It means that their presence on low
redshifts is connected with the recurrence phenomenon, sequential wet minor
mergings, because timescale of the activity does not exceed several units of
$10^7$ years.
  2. We define a new class - ""AGN III"" as active galactic nuclei in isolated
late-type spirals with low-mass rapidly rotating pseudobulges. We also state
that only such objects can be in the primordial phase of activity at low
redshifts. Black holes in such galaxies have masses $M_{BH}<10^7M_\odot$ and
also, probably very high spin. Such properties can explain their peculiar
emission spectra.
  A good representative of AGN III might be the galaxies with narrow (${\rm
FWHM}(H\beta)\leq1200$ km/s) broad permitted emission lines - NLS. It is
believed that their black hole masses are less than $M_{BH}<10^7M_\odot$ and
their host galaxies have pseudobulges instead of the classical ones. Because
host galaxies of NLS have pseudobulges and BLS (Broad-Line Seyfert galaxies)
have classical bulges these two types of objects cannot have evolutionary
connection. Presumably, the parent population of NLS are the quasars of

a non-thermal parameter, quantum fluctuations are critically enhanced, often
leading to the emergence of unconventional superconductivity. In these `quantum
critical' superconductors it has been widely reported that the normal-state
properties above the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ often exhibit
anomalous non-Fermi liquid behaviors and enhanced electron correlations.
However, the effect of these strong critical fluctuations on the
superconducting condensate below $T_c$ is less well established. Here we report
measurements of the magnetic penetration depth in heavy-fermion, iron-pnictide,
and organic superconductors located close to antiferromagnetic quantum critical
points showing that the superfluid density in these nodal superconductors
universally exhibit, unlike the expected $T$-linear dependence, an anomalous
3/2 power-law temperature dependence over a wide temperature range. We propose
that this non-integer power-law can be explained if a strong renormalization of
effective Fermi velocity due to quantum fluctuations occurs only for momenta
$\bm{k}$ close to the nodes in the superconducting energy gap $\Delta(\bm{k})$.
We suggest that such `nodal criticality' may have an impact on low-energy

The low C/Fe ratio distinguishes this object from most other extremely metal
poor stars. The effective temperature and surface gravity have been determined
to be Teff = 5811 plus/minus 150 K and log g = 4.0 plus/minus 0.5. The surface
gravity estimate is problematical in that it places the star between the main
sequence and the subgiants in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. If it is assumed
that the star is on the main sequence, its mass and are estimated to be M =
0.72 plus/minus 0.06 Msun and L = 0.45 plus/minus 0.10 Lsun, placing it at a
distance of 1.35 plus/minus 0.16 kpc. The upper limit on the lithium abundance,
A(Li) < 0.9, is inconsistent with the star being a dwarf, assuming that mixing
is due only to convection. In this paper, we propose that SJ102915 is a
sub-giant that formed with significantly higher Z than currently observed, in
agreement with theoretical predictions for the minimum C and/or O abundances
needed for low mass star formation. In this scenario, extremely low Z and low
Li abundance result from gravitational settling on the main sequence followed
by incomplete convective dredge-up during subgiant evolution. The observed Fe
abundance requires the initial Fe abundance to be enhanced compared to C and O,
which we interpret as formation of SJ102915 occurring in the vicinity of a type

diazonium salts is used to covalently attach scFv to NT-FETs, as confirmed by
atomic force microscopy, while preserving the activity of the biological

functionalized NT-FET may be used to detect the binding of OPN to the
complementary scFv protein. A concentration-dependent increase in the
source-drain current is observed in the regime of clinical significance, with a
detection limit of approximately 30 fM. The scFv-NT hybrid devices exhibit
selectivity for OPN over other control proteins. These devices respond to the
presence of OPN in a background of concentrated bovine serum albumin, without
loss of signal. Based on these observations, the detection mechanism is
attributed to changes in scattering at scFv protein-occupied defect sites on
the carbon nanotube sidewall. The functionalization procedure described here is

original idea of the MapReduce framework and are currently gaining a lot of
momentum in both research and industrial communities. We also cover a set of
introduced systems that have been implemented to provide declarative
programming interfaces on top of the MapReduce framework. In addition, we
review several large scale data processing systems that resemble some of the
ideas of the MapReduce framework for different purposes and application
scenarios. Finally, we discuss some of the future research directions for
implementing the next generation of MapReduce-like solutions.

eight galaxies from the rotation velocity data from THINGS, we find that the

isothermal Boltzmann gas, and suggests that an effective description in terms
of a Boltzmann gas is possible for dark matter in these regions. This could be
an indication that dark matter self-interactions are sufficient in strength and
number to lead to thermal equilibrium in these regions. We write down the
dynamics and boundary conditions for a Boltzmann gas description and examine
some of its qualitative and quantitative consequences. Solutions to the
dynamical system are determined by three dimensionfull parameters, and provide
reasonable fits to the rotational velocity data in the regions where the
Boltzmann-like behavior was found. Unlike in the usual approach to curve
fitting, we do not assume a specific form for the dark matter density profile

follows a Gaussian distribution. The width of the distribution, and hence the
degree of roughness of the energy landscape, was varied and its effect on the
particle dynamics studied. This situation represents an example of Brownian
dynamics in the presence of disorder. In the experiments, the energy landscapes
were generated optically using a holographic set-up with a spatial light
modulator, and the particle trajectories were followed by video microscopy. The
dynamics are characterized using, e.g., the time-dependent diffusion
coefficient, the mean squared displacement, the van Hove function and the
non-Gaussian parameter. In both, experiments and simulations, the dynamics are
initially diffusive, show an extended sub-diffusive regime at intermediate
times before diffusive motion is recovered at very long times. The dependence
of the long-time diffusion coefficient on the width of the Gaussian
distribution agrees with theoretical predictions. Compared to the dynamics in a
one-dimensional potential energy landscape, the localization at intermediate
times is weaker and the diffusive regime at long times reached earlier, which
is due to the possibility to avoid local maxima in two-dimensional energy
landscapes.

a wide range of questions. These analyses will, for example, identify genes
that have evolutionary shifts in expression that are correlated with
evolutionary changes in morphological, physiological, and developmental
characters of interest. This will provide entirely new opportunities to
identify genes related to particular phenotypes. There are, however, three key
challenges that must be addressed for such studies to realize their potential.
First, gene expression data must be measured from multiple species, some of
which may be field collected, and parameterized in such a way that they can be
compared across species. Second, it will be necessary to develop phylogenetic
comparative methods suitable for large multidimensional datasets. In most
phylogenetic comparative studies to date, the number n of independent
observations (independent contrasts) has been greater than the number p of
variables (characters). The behavior of comparative methods for these classic
n>p problems are now well understood under a wide variety of conditions. In
gene expression studies, and studies based on other high-throughput tools, the
number n of samples is dwarfed by the number p of variables. The estimated
covariance matrices will be singular, complicating their analysis and
interpretation, and prone to spurious results. Third, new approaches are needed
to investigate the expression of the many genes whose phylogenies are not
congruent with species phylogenies due to gene loss, gene duplication, and
incomplete lineage sorting. Here we outline general project design
considerations for phylogenetic analyses of gene expression, and suggest
solutions to these three categories of challenges. These topics are relevant to
high-throughput phenotypic data well beyond gene expression.

found [arXiv:1008.4638] to exhibit two types of gauge invariances: the standard
gauge transformations (SGTs) and the nonstandard gauge transformations (NSGTs).
In the present work we show that these transformations are not exclusive to
compactified scenarios. Introducing a notion of hidden symmetry, based on the
fundamental concept of canonical transformation, we analyse three different
gauge systems, each of which is mapped to a certain effective theory that is
invariant under the so-called SGTs and NSGTs. The systems under discussion are:
(i) four dimensional pure $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills theory, (ii) four dimensional
$SU(3)$ Yang-Mills with spontaneous symmetry breaking, and (iii) pure
Yang-Mills theory with one universal compact extra dimension. The canonical
transformation, that induces the notion of hidden symmetry, maps objects with
well defined transformation laws under a gauge group $G$ to well defined
objects under a non-trivial subgroup $H \subset G$. In the case where
spontaneous symmetry breaking is present, the set of SGTs corresponds to the
group into which the original gauge group is broken into, whereas the NSGTs are
associated to the broken generators and can be used to define the unitary
gauge. For the system (iii), the SGTs coincide with the gauge group $
SU(N,\cal{M}^{4}) $, whereas the NSGTs do not form a group; in this system the
'fundamental' theory and the effective one are shown to be classically
equivalent.

clear evidence for helium in its spectral evolution. Instead, we detect
prominent Ca II lines at all epochs, which relates this transient to previously
described 'Ca-rich' or 'gap' transients. However, the photospheric spectra
(from -3 to +32 d with respect to peak) of SN 2012hn show a series of
absorption lines which are unique, and a red continuum that is likely intrinsic
rather than due to extinction. Lines of Ti II and Cr II are visible. This may
be a temperature effect, which could also explain the red photospheric colour.
A nebular spectrum at +150d shows prominent CaII, OI, CI and possibly MgI lines
which appear similar in strength to those displayed by core-collapse SNe. To
add to the puzzle, SN 2012hn is located at a projected distance of 6 kpc from
an E/S0 host and is not close to any obvious starforming region. Overall SN
2012hn resembles a group of faint H-poor SNe that have been discovered recently

missing. They all appear to explode preferentially in remote locations offset
from a massive host galaxy with deep limits on any dwarf host galaxies,
favouring old progenitor systems. SN 2012hn adds heterogeneity to this sample
of objects. We discuss potential explosion channels including He-shell

in terms of its infinitesimal generator on an appropriate domain, and shown to
be the limit in distribution of a certain sequence of Feller diffusions with

and the evolution of elliptical galaxies(EGs). In order to understand the past
merging history of EGs, we studied the optical-NIR color gradients of 204 EGs.
The use of the optical and the NIR data provides large wavelength baselines,
and breaks the age-metallicity(Z) degeneracy, allowing us to derive age and Z
gradients. The use of the deep SDSS Stripe 82 images make it possible for us to
examine how the color/age/Z gradients are related to merging features. We find
that the optical-NIR color and the age/Z gradients of EGs with tidal features
are consistent with those of relaxed EGs suggesting that the two populations
underwent a similar merging history on average and that mixing of stars was
more or less completed before the tidal features disappear. EGs with dust
features have steeper color gradients than the other two types, even after
masking out dust features during the analysis, which can be due to a process
involving wet merging. More importantly, we find that the scatter in the
color/age/Z gradients of the relaxed and merging feature types, decreases as
their luminosities increase at M > 10^{11.4} M_{\odot} but stays to be large at
lower luminosities. Mean Z gradients appear nearly constant over the explored
mass range, but a possible flattening is observed at the massive end. According
to our toy model that predicts how the distribution of Z gradients changes as a
result of major dry merging, the mean Z gradient should flatten by 40% and its
scatter become smaller by 80% per a mass doubling scale if EGs evolve only
through major dry merger. Our result, although limited by a number statistics
at the massive end, is consistent with the picture that major dry merging is an
important mechanism for the evolution for EGs at M > 10^{11.4} M_{\odot}, but
less important at the lower mass range.

corresponding Schubert varieties. These descriptions and formulas are given in
terms of two equivalent combinatorial models: excited Young diagrams and
set-valued tableaux. The restriction fomulas are positive, in that for a
Schubert variety of codimension d, the formula equals (-1)^d times a sum, with
nonnegative coefficients, of monomials in the expressions (e^{-\alpha}-1), as
\alpha runs over the positive roots. In types A_n and C_n the restriction
formulas had been proved earlier by [Kreiman 05], [Kreiman 06] by a different
method. In type A_n, the formula for the Hilbert series had been proved earlier
by [Li-Yong 12]. The method of this paper, which relies on a restriction
formula of [Graham 02] and [Willems 06], is based on the method used by
[Ikeda-Naruse 09] to obtain the analogous formulas in equivariant cohomology.
The formulas we give differ from the K-theoretic restriction formulas given by
[Ikeda-Naruse 11], which use different versions of excited Young diagrams and
set-valued tableaux. We also give Hilbert series and Hilbert polynomial
formulas which are valid for Schubert varieties in any cominuscule flag
variety, in terms of the 0-Hecke algebra.

unpinning rather than a change in the intrinsic surface recombination velocity.
It is concluded that $S$ depends on $P$ throughout the experimentally

associated dust emission; (2) an almost unresolved UCHII region (EAST), located
6 arcsec to the east of the cometary UCHII region, with an electron density
1.3x10^5 cm^{-3}, and associated with a compact dust clump detected at
millimeter and mid-infrared wavelengths; and (3) a compact source (CORE),
located 2 arcsec to the southwest of the cometary arc, with a flux density
increasing with frequency, and embedded in a dust condensation of 30 Msun. The
CORE source is resolved into two compact and unresolved sources which can be
well-fit by two homogeneous hypercompact HII regions each one photo-ionized by
a B0.5 ZAMS star, or by free-free radiation from shock-ionized gas resulting
from the interaction of a jet/outflow system with the surrounding environment.
The spatial distribution and kinematics of water masers close to the CORE-N and

some barred S0s are related to bar resonances in a similar manner as the inner
and outer rings, for which the outer/inner length ratio 2. Inner lenses in the
non-barred galaxies normalized to galaxy diameter are clearly smaller than
those in the barred systems. Interestingly, these small lenses in the
non-barred galaxies have similar sizes as barlenses (lens-like structures
embedded in a bar), and therefore might actually be barlenses in former barred
galaxies, in which the outer, more elongated bar component, has been destroyed.
We also find that fully developed inner lenses are on average a factor 1.3
larger than bars, whereas inner rings have similar sizes as bars. The fraction
of inner lenses is found to be constant in all family classes (A, AB, B).
Nuclear bars appear most frequently among the weakly barred (AB) galaxies,
which is consistent with the theoretical models by Maciejewski & Athanassoula
(2008). Similar sized bars as the nuclear bars were detected in seven
'non-barred' S0s. Galaxy luminosity does not uniquely define the sizes of bars
or bar-related structures, neither is there any upper limit in galaxy
luminosity for bar formation. Although all the family classes cover the same
range of galaxy luminosity, the non-barred (A) galaxies are on average 0.6 mag
brighter than the strongly barred (B) systems. Overall, our results are
consistent with the idea that bars play an important role in the formation of
the structure components of galaxies. The fact that multiple lenses are common
in S0s, and that at least the inner lenses can have very old stellar
populations, implies that the last destructive merger, or major gas accretion
event, must have taken place at a fairly high redshift.

HD169142 probing its protoplanetary disk as close as ~0.1"" to the star. Our
images trace the face-on disk out to ~1.7"" (~250 AU) and reveal distinct
sub-structures for the first time: 1) the inner disk (<20 AU) appears to be
depleted in scattering dust grains; 2) an unresolved disk rim is imaged at ~25
AU; 3) an annular gap extends from ~40 - 70 AU; 4) local brightness asymmetries
are found on opposite sides of the annular gap. We discuss different
explanations for the observed morphology among which ongoing planet formation
is a tempting - but yet to be proven - one. Outside of ~85 AU the surface
brightness drops off roughly r^{-3.3}, but describing the disk regions between
85-120 AU / 120-250 AU separately with power-laws r^{-2.6} / r^{-3.9} provides
a better fit hinting towards another discontinuity in the disk surface. The
flux ratio between the disk integrated polarized light and the central star is
~4.1 * 10^{-3}. Finally, combining our results with those from the literature,
~40% of the scattered light in the H-band appears to be polarized. Our results

minimax lower bound. The problem exhibits new features that are significantly
different from those that occur in the conventional nonparametric function
estimation problems. Standard techniques fail to yield good results, and new
tools are thus needed. We first develop a lower bound technique that is
particularly well suited for treating ""two-directional"" problems such as
estimating sparse covariance matrices. The result can be viewed as a
generalization of Le Cam's method in one direction and Assouad's Lemma in
another. This lower bound technique is of independent interest and can be used
for other matrix estimation problems. We then establish a rate sharp minimax
lower bound for estimating sparse covariance matrices under the spectral norm
by applying the general lower bound technique. A thresholding estimator is
shown to attain the optimal rate of convergence under the spectral norm. The
results are then extended to the general matrix $\ell_w$ operator norms for
$1\le w\le \infty$. In addition, we give a unified result on the minimax rate
of convergence for sparse covariance matrix estimation under a class of Bregman
divergence losses.

commercial and research purposes, privacy issues about the individuals in
social networks have become serious concerns. Vertex identification, which
identifies a particular user from a network based on background knowledge such
as vertex degree, is one of the most important problems that has been
addressed. In reality, however, each individual in a social network is inclined
to be associated with not only a vertex identity but also a community identity,
which can represent the personal privacy information sensitive to the public,
such as political party affiliation. This paper first addresses the new privacy
issue, referred to as community identification, by showing that the community
identity of a victim can still be inferred even though the social network is
protected by existing anonymity schemes. For this problem, we then propose the
concept of \textit{structural diversity} to provide the anonymity of the
community identities. The $k$-Structural Diversity Anonymization ($k$-SDA) is
to ensure sufficient vertices with the same vertex degree in at least $k$
communities in a social network. We propose an Integer Programming formulation
to find optimal solutions to $k$-SDA and also devise scalable heuristics to
solve large-scale instances of $k$-SDA from different perspectives. The
performance studies on real data sets from various perspectives demonstrate the
practical utility of the proposed privacy scheme and our anonymization
approaches.

puts their efforts into management. The management effort of an agent improves

configuration, in which one wavenumber, $k_3$, is much smaller than the other
two, $k_3\ll k_1\approx k_2$, plays a special role in constraining the physics
of inflation. In this paper we study a new phenomenological signature in the
squeezed-limit bispectrum: namely, the amplitude of the squeezed-limit
bispectrum depends on an angle between ${\bf k}_1$ and ${\bf k}_3$ such that
$B_\zeta(k_1, k_2, k_3) \to 2 \sum_L c_L P_L(\hat{\bf k}_1 \cdot \hat{\bf k}_3)
P_\zeta(k_1)P_\zeta(k_3)$, where $P_L$ are the Legendre polynomials. While
$c_0$ is related to the usual local-form $f_{\rm NL}$ parameter as $c_0=6f_{\rm
NL}/5$, the higher-multipole coefficients, $c_1$, $c_2$, etc., have not been
constrained by the data. Primordial curvature perturbations sourced by
large-scale magnetic fields generate non-vanishing $c_0$, $c_1$, and $c_2$.
Inflation models whose action contains a term like $I(\phi)^2 F^2$ generate
$c_2=c_0/2$. A recently proposed ""solid inflation"" model generates $c_2\gg
c_0$. A cosmic-variance-limited experiment measuring temperature anisotropy of
the cosmic microwave background up to $\ell_{\rm max}=2000$ is able to measure
these coefficients down to $\delta c_0=4.4$, $\delta c_1=61$, and $\delta
c_2=13$ (68% CL). We also find that $c_0$ and $c_1$, and $c_0$ and $c_2$, are
nearly uncorrelated. Measurements of these coefficients will open up a new
window into the physics of inflation such as the existence of vector fields
during inflation or non-trivial symmetry structure of inflaton fields. Finally,
we show that the original form of the Suyama-Yamaguchi inequality does not
apply to the case involving higher-spin fields, but a generalized form does.

groups of Lie type in computational group theory is the construction of
unipotent elements. In the existing algorithms unipotent elements are found by
random search and therefore the running time of these algorithms is polynomial
in the underlying field size $q$ which makes them unfeasible for most practical
applications \cite{guralnick01.169}. Meanwhile, the input size of recognition
algorithms involves only $\log q$. The present paper introduces a new approach
to construction of unipotent elements in which the running time of the
algorithm is quadratic in characteristic $p$ of the underlying field and is
polynomial in $\log q$; for small values of $p$ (which make a vast and
practically important class of problems), the complexity of these algorithms is
polynomial in the input size.
  For $\psl_2(q)$, $\qpone$, we present a Monte-Carlo algorithm which
constructs a root subgroup $U$, the maximal torus $T$ normalizing $U$ and a
Weyl group element $w$ which conjugates $U$ to its opposite. Moreover, we
extend this result and construct Steinberg generators for the black box
untwisted classical groups defined over a field of odd size $q=p^k$ where
$\qpone$. Our algorithms run in time quadratic in characteristic $p$ of the
underlying field and polynomial in $\log q$ and the Lie rank $n$ of the group.
  The case $\qmone$ requires the use of additional tools and is treated
separately in our next paper \cite{suko12B}. Further, and much stronger results
can be found in \cite{suko12E,suko12F}.

populations using a simple prescription for a Hubble time of relaxation driven
evolution of cluster mass and radius, and explore the conditions under which
the RD can be used as a standard ruler. We consider a power-law cluster initial
mass function (CIMF) with and without an exponential truncation, and focus in
particular on a flat and a steep CIMF (power-law indices of 0 and -2,
respectively). For the initial half-mass radii at birth we adopt either
Roche-lobe filling conditions ('filling',meaning that the ratio of half-mass to
Jacobi radius is approximately rh/rJ ~ 0.15) or strongly Roche-lobe
under-filling conditions ('under-filling', implying that initially rh/rJ <<
0.15). Assuming a constant orbital velocity about the galaxy centre we find for
a steep CIMF that the typical half-light radius scales with galactocentric
radius RG as RG^1/3. This weak scaling is consistent with observations, but
this scenario has the (well known) problem that too many low-mass clusters
survive. A flat CIMF with 'filling' initial conditions results in the correct
mass function at old ages, but with too many large (massive) clusters at large
RG. An 'underfilling' GC population with a flat CIMF also results in the
correct mass function, and can also successfully reproduce the shape of the RD,
with a peak size that is (almost) independent of RG. In this case, the peak
size depends (almost) only on the peak mass of the GC mass function. The (near)
universality of the GC RD is therefore because of the (near) universality of
the CIMF. There are some extended GCs in the outer halo of the Milky Way that
cannot be explained by this model.

Arbitrary-Eulerian-Lagrangian (ALE) one-step WENO finite volume schemes for
solving nonlinear hyperbolic systems of conservation laws on moving two
dimensional unstructured triangular meshes. A WENO reconstruction algorithm is
used to achieve high order accuracy in space and a high order one-step time
discretization is achieved by using the local space-time Galerkin predictor.
For that purpose, a new element--local weak formulation of the governing PDE is
adopted on moving space--time elements. The space-time basis and test functions
are obtained considering Lagrange interpolation polynomials passing through a
predefined set of nodes. Moreover, a polynomial mapping defined by the same
local space-time basis functions as the weak solution of the PDE is used to map
the moving physical space-time element onto a space-time reference element. To
maintain algorithmic simplicity, the final ALE one-step finite volume scheme
uses moving triangular meshes with straight edges. This is possible in the ALE
framework, which allows a local mesh velocity that is different from the local
fluid velocity. We present numerical convergence rates for the schemes
presented in this paper up to sixth order of accuracy in space and time and

a Fayet-Illiopolous term, which emerges at late times due to the coupling of
the chameleon to two charged scalars. We examine the conditions under which

graphical model under the assumption that the data follow a joint normal
distribution. This neat property makes high-dimensional precision matrix
estimation very appealing in many applications. However, in practice we often
face nonnormal data, and variable transformation is often used to achieve
normality. In this paper we consider the nonparanormal model that assumes that
the variables follow a joint normal distribution after a set of unknown
monotone transformations. The nonparanormal model is much more flexible than
the normal model while retaining the good interpretability of the latter in
that each zero entry in the sparse precision matrix of the nonparanormal model
corresponds to a pair of conditionally independent variables. In this paper we
show that the nonparanormal graphical model can be efficiently estimated by
using a rank-based estimation scheme which does not require estimating these
unknown transformation functions. In particular, we study the rank-based
graphical lasso, the rank-based neighborhood Dantzig selector and the
rank-based CLIME. We establish their theoretical properties in the setting
where the dimension is nearly exponentially large relative to the sample size.
It is shown that the proposed rank-based estimators work as well as their
oracle counterparts defined with the oracle data. Furthermore, the theory
motivates us to consider the adaptive version of the rank-based neighborhood
Dantzig selector and the rank-based CLIME that are shown to enjoy graphical
model selection consistency without assuming the irrepresentable condition for
the oracle and rank-based graphical lasso. Simulated and real data are used to
demonstrate the finite performance of the rank-based estimators.

  243-253",,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we propose a parallel coordinate descent algorithm for solving
smooth convex optimization problems with separable constraints that may arise
e.g. in distributed model predictive control (MPC) for linear network systems.
Our algorithm is based on block coordinate descent updates in parallel and has
a very simple iteration. We prove (sub)linear rate of convergence for the new
algorithm under standard assumptions for smooth convex optimization. Further,
our algorithm uses local information and thus is suitable for distributed
implementations. Moreover, it has low iteration complexity, which makes it
appropriate for embedded control. An MPC scheme based on this new parallel
algorithm is derived, for which every subsystem in the network can compute
feasible and stabilizing control inputs using distributed and cheap
computations. For ensuring stability of the MPC scheme, we use a terminal cost
formulation derived from a distributed synthesis. Preliminary numerical tests
show better performance for our optimization algorithm than other existing
methods.

regions of a noisy quantum channel by using the idea of rate increment. While
in case of a classical channel only the rate of classical communication can be

the working mechanism of quantum repeaters and the various quantum
communication protocols are all based on quantum entanglement. On the other
hand, quantum entanglement is extremely fragile and sensitive to the noise of
the communication channel over which it has been transmitted. To share
entanglement between distant points, high fidelity quantum channels are needed.
In practice, these communication links are noisy, which makes it impossible or
extremely difficult and expensive to distribute entanglement. In this work we
first show that quantum entanglement can be generated by a new idea, exploiting
the most natural effect of the communication channels: the noise itself of the
link. We prove that the noise transformation of quantum channels that are not
able to transmit quantum entanglement can be used to generate distillable
(useable) entanglement from classically correlated input. We call this new
phenomenon the Correlation Conversion property (CC-property) of quantum
channels. The proposed solution does not require any non-local operation or
local measurement by the parties, only the use of standard quantum channels.
Our results have implications and consequences for the future of quantum
communications, and for global-scale quantum communication networks. The
discovery also revealed that entanglement generation by local operations is
possible.

phase transition between them are beyond Landau's symmetry breaking formalism.
In this paper we study (1) the critical theory of phase transition between
trivial and non-trivial SPTs, and (2) the relation between such critical theory
and the gapless boundary theory of SPTs. Based on examples of SO(3) and SU(2)
SPTs, we propose that under appropriate boundary condition the critical theory
contains the delocalized version of the boundary excitations. In addition, we
prove that the boundary theory is the critical theory spatially confined
between two SPTs. We expect these conclusions to hold in general and, in
particular, for discrete symmetry groups as well.

topological transitions. We consider in detail the case of a triplet

$E_l$ and muffin-tin sphere radii. To overcome these dependences, we evaluate
approaches that eliminate the linearization error systematically by adding
local orbitals (LOs) to the basis set. We consider two kinds of LOs: (i)
constructed from solutions $u_l(r,E)$ to the scalar-relativistic approximation
of the radial Dirac equation with $E>E_l$ and (ii) constructed from second
energy derivatives $\partial^2 u_l(r,E) / \partial E^2$ at $E=E_l$. We find
that the latter eliminates the error most efficiently and yields the density
functional answer to many electronic and materials properties with very high
precision. Finally, we demonstrate that the so constructed LAPW+LO basis shows
a more favorable convergence behavior than the conventional LAPW basis due to a
better decoupling of muffin-tin and interstitial regions, similarly to the
related APW+lo approach, which requires an extra set of LOs to reach the same

are the breeding ground of sources of gravitational waves for the advanced
detectors LIGO and Virgo. These systems deserve a close study to estimate rates
and parameter distribution. This is not an easy task, since the evolution of a
dense stellar cluster involves the integration of $N$ bodies with high
resolution in time and space and including hard binaries and their encounters
and, in the case of gravitational waves (GWs), one needs to take into account
important relativistic corrections. In this work we present the first
implementation of the effect of spin in mergers in a direct-summation code,
NBODY6. We employ non-spinning post-Newtonian corrections to the Newtonian
accelerations up to 3.5 post-Newtonian (PN) order as well as the spin-orbit
coupling up to next-to-lowest order and the lowest order spin-spin coupling. We
integrate spin precession and add a consistent treatment of mergers. We analyse
the implementation by running a set of two-body experiments and then we run a
set of 500 simulations of a relativistic stellar cluster. In spite of the large
number of mergers in our tests, the application of the algorithm is robust. We
find in particular the formation of a runaway star whose spin decays with the
mass it wins, independently of the initial value of the spins of the stars.
More remarkably, the subset of compact objects that do not undergo many
mergers, and hence represent a more realistic system, has a correlation between
the final absolute spin and the initial choice for the initial distribution,
which could provide us with information about the evolution of spins in dense
clusters once the first detections have started.

interior-point framework. By adding self-concordant barrier terms to the
ordinary Lagrangian, we prove under mild assumptions that the corresponding
family of augmented dual functions is self-concordant. This makes it possible
to efficiently use the Newton method for tracing the central path. We show that
the new algorithm is globally convergent and highly parallelizable and thus it
is suitable for solving large-scale separable convex problems.

rather on how the mean degree scales with the network size. In these networks,
even when the coherence is absent, adding a fraction s of random connections
leads to an enhancement of coherence proportional to s. Our results provide a

13.5% (layers under tensile strain), and 19.7% (layers under compressive

observed, followed by the appearance of V-defects. We propose that those
hillocks arise due to kinetic roughening, and that V-defects subsequently
appear beyond a critical hillock size. It is seen that the critical thickness
for the appearance of V-defects increases together with the surface diffusion
length either by increasing the temperature or the In flux because of a
surfactant effect. In thick InAlN layers, a better (worse) In incorporation
occurring on the concave (convex) shape surfaces of the V-defects is observed
leading to a top phase-separated InAlN layer lying on the initial homogeneous
InAlN layer after V-defects coalescence. It is suggested that similar

an asymmetric metric space $(V,d)$ with specified vertices s and t, the goal is
to find an s-t path of minimum length that passes through all the vertices in
V.
  This problem is closely related to the Asymmetric TSP (ATSP), which seeks to
find a tour (instead of an $s-t$ path) visiting all the nodes: for ATSP, a
$\rho$-approximation guarantee implies an $O(\rho)$-approximation for ATSPP.
However, no such connection is known for the integrality gaps of the linear
programming relaxations for these problems: the current-best approximation
algorithm for ATSPP is $O(\log n/\log\log n)$, whereas the best bound on the
integrality gap of the natural LP relaxation (the subtour elimination LP) for
ATSPP is $O(\log n)$.
  In this paper, we close this gap, and improve the current best bound on the
integrality gap from $O(\log n)$ to $O(\log n/\log\log n)$. The resulting
algorithm uses the structure of narrow $s$-$t$ cuts in the LP solution to
construct a (random) tree spanning tree that can be cheaply augmented to
contain an Eulerian $s$-$t$ walk.
  We also build on a result of Oveis Gharan and Saberi and show a strong form
of Goddyn's conjecture about thin spanning trees implies the integrality gap of
the subtour elimination LP relaxation for ATSPP is bounded by a constant.
Finally, we give a simpler family of instances showing the integrality gap of
this LP is at least 2.

significantly improve the performance of digital subscriber line (DSL)
broadband access networks. The basic concept of DSM is to coordinate
transmission over multiple DSL lines so as to mitigate the impact of crosstalk
interference amongst them. Many algorithms have been proposed to tackle the
nonconvex optimization problems appearing in DSM, almost all of them relying on
a standard subgradient based dual decomposition approach. In practice however,
this approach is often found to lead to extremely slow convergence or even no
convergence at all, one of the reasons being the very difficult tuning of the
stepsize parameters. In this paper we propose a novel improved dual
decomposition approach inspired by recent advances in mathematical programming.
It uses a smoothing technique for the Lagrangian combined with an optimal
gradient based scheme for updating the Lagrange multipliers. The stepsize
parameters are furthermore selected optimally removing the need for a tuning
strategy. With this approach we show how the convergence of current
state-of-the-art DSM algorithms based on iterative convex approximations
(SCALE, CA-DSB) can be improved by one order of magnitude. Furthermore we apply
the improved dual decomposition approach to other DSM algorithms (OSB, ISB,
ASB, (MS)-DSB, MIW) and propose further improvements to obtain fast and robust
DSM algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the improved dual
decomposition approach for a number of realistic multi-user DSL scenarios.

because the distance metric employed can significantly affect the performance
of many learning methods. Quadratic Mahalanobis metric learning is a popular
approach to the problem, but typically requires solving a semidefinite
programming (SDP) problem, which is computationally expensive. Standard
interior-point SDP solvers typically have a complexity of $O(D^{6.5})$ (with
$D$ the dimension of input data), and can thus only practically solve problems
exhibiting less than a few thousand variables. Since the number of variables is
$D (D+1) / 2 $, this implies a limit upon the size of problem that can
practically be solved of around a few hundred dimensions. The complexity of the
popular quadratic Mahalanobis metric learning approach thus limits the size of
problem to which metric learning can be applied. Here we propose a
significantly more efficient approach to the metric learning problem based on
the Lagrange dual formulation of the problem. The proposed formulation is much
simpler to implement, and therefore allows much larger Mahalanobis metric
learning problems to be solved. The time complexity of the proposed method is
$O (D ^ 3) $, which is significantly lower than that of the SDP approach.
Experiments on a variety of datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves an accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art, but is applicable to
significantly larger problems. We also show that the proposed method can be
applied to solve more general Frobenius-norm regularized SDP problems
approximately.

pressing mysteries of the Universe. The current standard $\Lambda$CDM model
uses two unknown entities to make everything fit: dark energy and dark matter,
which together would constitute more than 95% of the energy density of the
Universe. A bit like saying that we have understood almost nothing, but without
openly admitting it. Here we start from the recent theoretical results that
come from the extension of general relativity to antimatter, through CPT
symmetry. This theory predicts a mutual gravitational repulsion between matter
and antimatter. Our basic assumption is that the Universe contains equal
amounts of matter and antimatter, with antimatter possibly located in cosmic
voids, as discussed in previous works. From this scenario we develop a simple
cosmological model, from whose equations we derive the first results. While the
existence of the elusive dark energy is completely replaced by gravitational
repulsion, the presence of dark matter is not excluded, but not strictly
required, as most of the related phenomena can also be ascribed to
repulsive-gravity effects. With a matter energy density ranging from $\sim5%$
(baryonic matter alone, and as much antimatter) to $\sim25%$ of the so-called
critical density, the present age of the Universe varies between about 13 and
$15\rm\,Gyr$. The SN Ia test is successfully passed, with residuals comparable
with those of the $\Lambda$CDM model in the observed redshift range, but with a
clear prediction for fainter SNe at higher $z$. Moreover, this model has

dependency models) in the form of belief networks, which make easy
interpretation and management of independence relationships possible, without
reference to numerical parameters (conditional probabilities). In this paper,
we study the following combinatorial problem: finding the minimum d-separating
set for two nodes in a dag. This set would represent the minimum information
(in the sense of minimum number of variables) necessary to prevent these two
nodes from influencing each other. The solution to this basic problem and some
of its extensions can be useful in several ways, as we shall see later. Our
solution is based on a two-step process: first, we reduce the original problem
to the simpler one of finding a minimum separating set in an undirected graph,
and second, we develop an algorithm for solving it.

with a combination of a generative planning tool and an influence diagram
solver. The problem is taken from an existing application in the domain of oil
spill emergency response. The planning agent manages constraints that order
sets of feasible equipment employment actions. This is mapped at an
intermediate level of abstraction onto an influence diagram. In addition, the
planner can apply a surveillance operator that determines observability of the
state---the unknown trajectory of the oil. The uncertain world state and the
objective function properties are part of the influence diagram structure, but
not represented in the planning agent domain. By exploiting this structure
under the constraints generated by the planning agent, the influence diagram
solution complexity simplifies considerably, and an optimum solution to the
employment problem based on the objective function is found. Finding this
optimum is equivalent to the simultaneous evaluation of a range of plans. This
result is an example of bounded optimality, within the limitations of this
hybrid generative planner and influence diagram architecture.

inference does not provide expected results either because it cannot produce

due to the principle of selecting a unique ordering of interpretations (which
can be encoded by one possibility distribution), but rather to the absence of
constraints expressing pieces of knowledge we have implicitly in mind. It is
advocated in this paper that constraints induced by independence information
can help finding the right ordering of interpretations. In particular,
independence constraints can be systematically assumed with respect to formulas
composed of literals which do not appear in the conditional knowledge base, or
for default rules with respect to situations which are ""normal"" according to
the other default rules in the base. The notion of independence which is used
can be easily expressed in the qualitative setting of possibility theory.
Moreover, when a counter-intuitive plausible conclusion of a set of defaults,
is in its rational closure, but not in its preferential closure, it is always
possible to repair the set of defaults so as to produce the desired conclusion.

surprising observation as an indication that the world has changed. In general,
we would expect that an agent making an observation may both want to revise
some earlier beliefs and assume that some change has occurred in the world. We
define a novel approach to belief change that allows us to do this, by applying

a qualitative Markov assumption, which says that state transitions are

The diagnostic performance in terms of the average probabilities assigned to
the actual diseases showed small sensitivity even to large amounts of noise. In

performance is average probability of the true hypotheses, rather than average

But, we show that even asymmetric, logodds-normal noise has modest effects. A
second reason is that the gold-standard posterior probabilities are often near

the computational complexity in the networks with exponentially many similar

to recent structured representations for POMDPs; here we use stochastic
situation calculus rules to specify the state transition function and the

actions representations in probabilistic STRIPS are exponentially larger than
using the representation proposed here.

strucures (Pearl 1988). However, in the social sciences and elsewhere models
are often used which correspond both causally and statistically to directed
graphs with directed cycles (Spirtes 1995). Pearl (1993) discussed predicting
the effects of intervention in models of this kind, so-called linear
non-recursive structural equation models. This raises the question of whether
it is possible to make inferences about causal structure with cycles, form
sample data. In particular do there exist general, informative, feasible and
reliable precedures for inferring causal structure from conditional
independence relations among variables in a sample generated by an unknown
causal structure? In this paper I present a discovery algorithm that is correct
in the large sample limit, given commonly (but often implicitly) made plausible
assumptions, and which provides information about the existence or
non-existence of causal pathways from one variable to another. The algorithm is
polynomial on sparse graphs.

acyclic graphs (see Pearl 1988), there is a natural extension of he concept to
directed cyclic graphs. When exactly the same set of d-separation relations
hold in two directed graphs, no matter whether respectively cyclic or acyclic,
we say that they are Markov equivalent. In other words, when two directed
cyclic graphs are Markov equivalent, the set of distributions that satisfy a
natural extension of the Global Directed Markov condition (Lauritzen et al.
1990) is exactly the same for each graph. There is an obvious exponential (in
the number of vertices) time algorithm for deciding Markov equivalence of two
directed cyclic graphs; simply chech all of the d-separation relations in each
graph. In this paper I state a theorem that gives necessary and sufficient
conditions for the Markov equivalence of two directed cyclic graphs, where each
of the conditions can be checked in polynomial time. Hence, the theorem can be
easily adapted into a polynomial time algorithm for deciding the Markov
equivalence of two directed cyclic graphs. Although space prohibits inclusion
of correctness proofs, they are fully described in Richardson (1994b).

paper we develop an efficient algorithm that incrementally enumerates the

enumeration algorithms are applicable in a variety of applications ranging from
medical expert systems to model-based diagnosis. Fundamentally, our algorithm
is simply performing a lazy enumeration of the sorted list of all

statement which is both easily understood and implemented. We show that for
singly connected networks, our algorithm generates the next instantiation in

analyze the behavior of several learning algorithms using different scoring

Thus, when the underlying domain model actually belongs to this class, the use
of a single link search procedure will result in learning of an incorrect

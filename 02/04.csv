appears as a quasar when its principal radio-axis happens to be oriented within
a certain cone opening angle around the observer's line of sight. Due to
geometrical projection, the observed sizes of quasars should therefore appear
smaller than those of radio galaxies. We show that this simple, unambiguous
prediction of the unified scheme is not borne out by the actually observed
angular sizes of radio galaxies and quasars. Except in the original 3CR sample,
based on which the unified scheme was proposed, in other much larger samples no
statistically significant difference is apparent in the size distributions of
radio galaxies and quasars. The population of low-excitation radio galaxies
with apparently no hidden quasars inside, which might explain the observed
excess number of radio galaxies at low redshifts, cannot still account for the
absence of any foreshortening of the sizes of quasars at large redshifts. On
the other hand from infrared and X-ray studies there is evidence of hidden
quasar within a dusty torus in many RGs, at $z>0.5$. It seems difficult how to
reconcile this with the absence of foreshortening of quasar sizes at even these
redshifts, and perhaps one has to allow that the major radio axis may not have
anything to do with the optical axis of the torus. Otherwise to resolve the
dichotomy of radio galaxies and quasars, a scheme quite different from the
present might be required.

a computational ""coincidence"". This naturally immerges in a four dimensional
generally covariant modified Yang-Mills action, which depends on the lorentzian
complex structure of spacetime and not its metric. This metric independence
makes the model renormalizable. It is a counter example to the general belief
that ""string theory is the only selfconsistent quantum model which includes
gravity"". The other properties of the model are phenomenologically very
interesting too. The modified Yang-Mills action generates a linear potential,
instead of the Coulomb-like (1/r) potential of the ordinary action. Therefore
the Yang-Mills excitations must be perturbatively confined. This separates the
solutions of the model into the vacuum bosonic sector of the periodic
configurations, the ""leptonic"" sector with fermionic solitons and their gauge
field excitations, the ""hadronic"" sector. Simple integrability conditions of
the pure geometric equations imply a limited number of ""leptonic"" and
""hadronic"" families. The geometric surfaces are generally inside the SU(2,2)
classical domain. Soliton spin and gravity measure how much the surface
penetrates inside the classical domain. The i0 point of infinity breaks the
SU(2,2) symmetry down to the Poincare and dilation groups. A scaling breaking
mechanism is presented. Hence the pure geometric modes and asymptotically flat
solitons of the model must belong to representations of the Poincare group. The
metrics compatible to the lorentzian complex structure are induced by a Kaehler
metric and the spacetime is a totally real lagrangian submanifold of a Kaehler
manifold. This opens up the possibility to use the geometric quantization
directly to the solitonic surfaces of the model, considering their

variations in the number counts of background sources, amplifying their

as magnification bias, depends on the intrinsic faint-end slope of the source
luminosity function. The bias is strongly negative for red galaxies, dominated
by the geometric area distortion, whereas it is mildly positive for blue
galaxies, enhancing the blue counts toward the cluster center. We generalize
the Bayesian approach of Umetsu et al. for reconstructing projected cluster
mass profiles, by incorporating multiple populations of background sources for
magnification bias measurements and combining them with complementary lens
distortion measurements, effectively breaking the mass-sheet degeneracy and
improving the statistical precision of cluster mass measurements. The approach
can be further extended to include strong-lensing projected mass estimates,
thus allowing for non-parametric absolute mass determinations in both the weak
and strong regimes. We apply this method to our recent CLASH lensing
measurements of MACS J1206.2-0847, and demonstrate how combining multi-probe
lensing constraints can improve the reconstruction of cluster mass profiles.
This method will also be useful for a stacked lensing analysis, combining all
lensing-related effects in the cluster regime, for a definitive determination
of the averaged mass profile.

roughening, with anomalous exponents related to the normal exponents of the
correlated dynamics, to an exponent characterizing the aggregation mechanism
and to that power law exponent. This is shown by a scaling approach extending
the Family-Vicsek relation previously derived for the models with
time-independent rates, thus providing a connection of normal and anomalous
growth models. Simulation results for several models support those conclusions.
Remarkable anomalous effects are observed even for slowly decreasing rates of
the correlated component, which may correspond to feasible temperature changes
in systems with activated dynamics. The scaling exponents of the correlated
component can be obtained only from the estimates of three anomalous exponents,
without knowledge of the aggregation mechanism, and a possible application is
discussed. For some models, the corresponding Edwards-Wilkinson and

derived. For models with crossover from random deposition (RD) to some
correlated deposition (CD) dynamics, with small probability p of CD, the
surface tension \nu and the nonlinear coefficient \lambda of the associated
equations have linear dependence on p due solely to this random choice.
However, they also depend on the regularized step functions present in the
analytical representations of the CD, whose expansion coefficients scale with p
according to the divergence of local height differences when p->0. The
superposition of those scaling factors gives \nu ~ p^2 for random deposition
with surface relaxation (RDSR) as the CD, and \nu ~ p, \lambda ~ p^{3/2} for
ballistic deposition (BD) as the CD, in agreement with simulation and other
scaling approaches. For bidisperse ballistic deposition (BBD), the same scaling
of RD-BD model is found. The Langevin equation for the model with competing
RDSR and BD, with probability p for the latter, is also constructed. It shows
linear p-dependence of \lambda, while the quadratic dependence observed in
previous simulations is explained by an additional crossover before the
asymptotic regime. The results highlight the relevance of scaling of the
coefficients of step function expansions in systems with steep surfaces, which
is responsible for noninteger exponents in some p-dependent stochastic
equations, and the importance of the physical correspondence of aggregation

arguments, supported by gauge/string holography, indicate that these membranes
are domain walls which separate discrete ""flux vacua"" with values of the
topological $\theta$ parameter which differ by $\pm 2\pi$. This exposes a close
analogy with 2D U(1) gauge theory, where $\theta$ can be interpreted as
electric polarization, and the domain walls are pointlike charged particles. In
4D QCD, the $\theta$ parameter represents background Ramond-Ramond flux, which
can be interpreted as a polarization of the charged membranes in the vacuum. In
this framework, the chiral condensate is formed from the quark surface modes on
the membranes. Massless Goldstone boson propagation takes place due to a
coordination between bulk oscillations of the polarization field $\theta$ and
the surface currents represented by the Chern-Simons 3-form on the brane
surface. This coordination is enforced by overall gauge invariance which
imposes an anomaly inflow constraint between bulk and surface currents.

stationary version of these AdS black holes represents rotating black strings.
The conformal field theory (CFT) dual of a black string lives in a Minkowski

We explore the consequences of this correspondence by investigating the
electromagnetic perturbations of a black string for different rotation
parameter values. As usual the electromagnetic quasinormal modes (QNM)
correspond to the poles of retarded Green's functions of $R$-symmetry currents
in the boundary field theory. The hydrodynamic regime of the QNM dispersion

Proposed approach to financial arithmetic is based on the financial flow
utility concept. This utility function is defined as linear extension of
multicriteria comparison determined by the time preference and the capital
preference. Then the present value is equal to financial flow utility.
Therefore, the law of diminishing marginal wealth utility has been considered
as additional feature of the present value. The future value is defined as the
inverse of utility function. This definition is a generalization of the Peccati
one. The net present value is given as the unique additive extension of
financial flow utility. Moreover, the synergy effect and the diversification
effect will be discussed. At the end, the axiomatic present value definition
will be specified in three ways.

no static stable spherically symmetric solutions that would interpolate from

magnets (HMs), which have band structures with one gapped spin channel and one
metallic channel, poses fundamental theoretical issues as well as having
importance for their potential applications. Here we use determinant quantum
Monte Carlo to study the impacts of an on-site Hubbard interaction $U$, finite
temperature, and an external (Zeeman) magnetic field on a bilayer tight-binding
model which is a half-metal in the absence of interactions, by calculating the
spectral density, conductivity, spin polarization of carriers, and local
magnetic properties. We quantify the effect of $U$ on the degree of thermal
depolarization, and follow relative band shifts and monitor when significant
gap states appear, each of which can degrade the HM character. For this model,
Zeeman coupling induces, at fixed particle number, two successive transitions:
compensated half-metal with spin-down band gap $\rightarrow$ metallic
ferromagnet $\rightarrow$ saturated ferromagnetic insulator. However, over much
of the more relevant parameter regime, the half-metallic properties are rather
robust to $U$.

interplay of phenotypic variation and natural selection through ecological
interactions, in the specific scales of the biological framework of adaptive

direct competition models (Lotka-Volterra models) involving a competition
kernel which describes the competition pressure from one individual to another
one. We extend this to a multi-resources chemostat model, where the competition
between individuals results from the sharing of several resources which have
their own dynamics. Starting from a stochastic birth and death process model,
we prove that, when advantageous mutations are rare, the population behaves on
the mutational time scale as a jump process moving between equilibrium states
(the polymorphic evolution sequence of the adaptive dynamics literature). An
essential technical ingredient is the study of the long time behavior of a
chemostat multi-resources dynamical system. In the small mutational steps limit
this process in turn gives rise to a differential equation in phenotype space
called canonical equation of adaptive dynamics. From this canonical equation
and still assuming small mutation steps, we prove a rigorous characterization
of the evolutionary branching points.

superfluidity, the Fulde-Ferrell (FF) pairing state with a single

complexibility of any realistic Fermi systems in nature. Here we theoretically
predict that the controlled setting of ultracold fermionic atoms with synthetic

recently in cold-atom laboratories, provides a promising route to realize the
long-sought FF superfluidity. At experimentally accessible low temperatures

state dominates the phase diagram, in sharp contrast to the conventional case
without spin-orbit coupling. We show that the finite centre-of-mass momentum
carried by Cooper pairs is directly measurable via momentum-resolved
radio-frequency spectroscopy. Our work opens the way to direct observation and

groups when their members combine efforts and resources to obtain a shared
benefit that is unachievable by an individual alone. However, understanding why
cooperation arises despite the natural tendency of individuals towards selfish
behavior is still an open problem and represents one of the most fascinating
challenges in evolutionary dynamics. Recently, the structural characterization
of the networks in which social interactions take place has shed some light on
the mechanisms by which cooperative behavior emerges and eventually overcomes
the natural temptation to defect. In particular, it has been found that the
heterogeneity in the number of social ties and the presence of tightly knit
communities lead to a significant increase in cooperation as compared with the
unstructured and homogeneous connection patterns considered in classical
evolutionary dynamics. Here, we investigate the role of social-ties dynamics
for the emergence of cooperation in a family of social dilemmas. Social
interactions are in fact intrinsically dynamic, fluctuating, and intermittent
over time, and they can be represented by time-varying networks. By considering
two experimental data sets of human interactions with detailed time
information, we show that the temporal dynamics of social ties has a dramatic
impact on the evolution of cooperation: the dynamics of pairwise interactions
favors selfish behavior.

substantial gap between existing theory and its current use in real-world
applications. It introduces a mathematical framework that generalizes the three
standard pillars of compressed sensing - namely, sparsity, incoherence and
uniform random subsampling - to three new concepts: asymptotic sparsity,
asymptotic incoherence and multilevel random sampling. The new theorems show
that compressed sensing is also possible, and reveals several advantages, under
these substantially relaxed conditions. The importance of this is threefold.
First, inverse problems to which compressed sensing is currently applied are
typically coherent. The new theory provides the first comprehensive
mathematical explanation for a range of empirical usages of compressed sensing
in real-world applications, such as medical imaging, microscopy, spectroscopy
and others. Second, in showing that compressed sensing does not require
incoherence, but instead that asymptotic incoherence is sufficient, the new
theory offers markedly greater flexibility in the design of sensing mechanisms.
Third, by using asymptotic incoherence and multi-level sampling to exploit not
just sparsity, but also structure, i.e. asymptotic sparsity, the new theory
shows that substantially improved reconstructions can be obtained from fewer
measurements.

model, are subtracted from those observed. The resulting O-C (observed minus

beat frequency between the ~1/2-hour Kepler cadence and the binary period, 39
candidate triple systems were identified. The periodic O-C curves for these

and so-called ""physical"" delay, in an attempt to extract a number of the system
parameters of the triple. We discuss the limitations of the information that
can be inferred from these O-C curves without further supplemental input, e.g.,
ground-based spectroscopy. Based on the limited range of orbital periods for
the triple star systems to which this search is sensitive, we can extrapolate
to estimate that at least 20% of all close binaries have tertiary companions.

possibility that they are exotic compact objects and we describe their exterior
gravitational field with a subclass of the Manko-Novikov metrics, which are
exact solutions of the vacuum Einstein's equations and can describe the
spacetime geometry around bodies with arbitrary mass-multipole moments. We
point out that around a Manko-Novikov object there may exist many disconnected
non-plunging regions at small radii, with no counterpart in the Kerr
background, and that their existence may be tested. For instance, in the
presence of an accretion disk, they may be filled by the accreting gas, forming
a ring structure that might remind the rings of Saturn. We suggest that the
existence of these regions may have a clear observational signature in the
waveform of the gravitational radiation emitted by an EMRI: in the last stage
of the inspiral, the waveform would be the combination of ""regular chirps"",
produced when the small object orbits in one of the non-plunging regions, and
""bursts"", released when the small object jumps from a non-plunging region to
another one at smaller radii. Our conclusions are supported by some numerical

flow, we propose a simple particle model. This model considers spherical
particles moving over an inclined flat surface based on three forces: gravity
as the driving force, repulsive force due to particle collision, and drag force
as the particle-- interaction through the ambient fluid. Numerical simulations
of this model are conducted in two different types of two-dimensional planes,
i.e., the monolayer was treated. In the horizontal plane parallel to the slope,
particles aggregate at the moving front of the granular flow; and subsequently,
flow instability occurs as a wavy pattern. This flow pattern is caused by the
interparticle interaction arising from the drag force. Additionally, a vortex
convection of particles is formed inside the aggregations. Meanwhile, in the
vertical plane on the slope, particle aggregation is also found at the moving
front of the granular flow. The aggregation resembles a head--tail structure,
where the frontal angle against the slope approaches 60 degree from a larger
angle as time progresses. Comparing the numerical result by varying the
particle size, the qualitative dynamics of the granular flow are independent of
size. To elucidate this reason, we perform a nondimensionalization for this
model. The result indicates that our model can be simplified to dimensionless
equations with one dimensionless parameter that represents the ratio of the
gravity term to the excluded volume effect.

over a wide range of hole concentrations, p, and Zn contents (y) in the CuO2

scale, {\epsilon}g, was found to be almost independent of the defect content at
a given value of p. The Zn induced rate of suppression of Tc, dTc(p)/dy, was
found to be strongly p-dependent and showed a systematic variation with hole
concentration, except in the vicinity of p ~ 0.125, i.e., near the so-called
1/8th anomaly where the charge and spin stripe orderings are at their strongest
in various families of hole doped cuprates. Near p ~ 0.125, the static striped
charge ordering is largely believed to dominate the T-p electronic phase
diagram. dTc(p)/dy decreased strongly around this composition, i.e., Zn
abruptly became less effective in degrading Tc when p ~ 0.125. This
observation, together with the facts that (i) Zn suppresses Tc most effectively
and (ii) the characteristic pseudogap energy scale remains insensitive to the
level of Zn substitution, provide us with important clues regarding the nature
and interplay of the underlying electronic correlations present in high-Tc
cuprates. We have discussed the possible connections among the stripe ordering,

this disk produces a broadband IR excess due to small dust near the dust

the contribution from this disk. 1RXS 1609B exhibits no 3-4um excess, nor does
its primary; however, the system as a whole has a modest 24um excess, which may
come from warm dust around the primary and/or BD. Neither object in the HIP
78530 system exhibits near- to mid-IR excesses. We additionally find that the
1-4um colors of HIP 78530B match a spectral type of M3+-2, inconsistent with
the M8 spectral type assigned based on its near-IR spectrum, indicating it may
be a low-mass star rather than a BD. We present new upper limits on additional
low-mass companions in the system (<5M_Jup beyond 175AU). Finally, we examine

harvesting (WEH), has recently drawn significant attention. In this paper, we
consider a point-to-point wireless link over the flat-fading channel, where the
receiver replenishes energy via WEH from the signals sent by the transmitter.
We consider a SISO (single-input single-output) system where the single-antenna
receiver cannot decode information and harvest energy independently from the
same signal received. Under this practical constraint, we propose a dynamic
power splitting (DPS) scheme, where the received signal is split into two
streams with adjustable power levels for information decoding and energy
harvesting separately based on the instantaneous channel condition that is
assumed to be known at the receiver. We derive the optimal power splitting rule
at the receiver to achieve various trade-offs between the maximum ergodic
capacity for information transfer and the maximum average harvested energy for
power transfer. Moreover, for the case when the channel state information is
also known at the transmitter, we investigate the joint optimization of
transmitter power control and receiver power splitting. Finally, we extend the
result for DPS to the SIMO (single-input multiple-output) system and

proper renormalization scale of the running coupling. The conventional
scale-setting procedure assigns an arbitrary range and an arbitrary systematic
error to fixed-order pQCD predictions. In fact, this {\it ad hoc} procedure
gives results which depend on the choice of the renormalization scheme, and it
is in conflict with the standard scale-setting procedure used in QED.
Predictions for physical results should be independent of the choice of scheme
or other theoretical conventions. We review current ideas and points of view on
how to deal with the renormalization scale ambiguity and show how to obtain
renormalization scheme- and scale- independent estimates. We begin by
introducing the renormalization group (RG) equation and an extended version,
which expresses the invariance of physical observables under both the
renormalization scheme and scale-parameter transformations. The RG equation
provides a convenient way for estimating the scheme- and scale- dependence of a
physical process. We then discuss self-consistency requirements of the RG
equations, such as reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity, which must be
satisfied by a scale-setting method. Four typical scale setting methods
suggested in the literature, {\it i.e.,} the Fastest Apparent Convergence (FAC)
criterion, the Principle of Minimum Sensitivity (PMS), the
Brodsky-Lepage-Mackenzie method (BLM), and the Principle of Maximum
Conformality (PMC), are introduced. Basic properties and their applications are
discussed. We pay particular attention to the PMC, which satisfies all of the
requirements of RG invariance...... [full Abstract is in the paper].

However, there is a distinct shortage of analytical discussion about the risks
of an attack, perhaps because of an implicit premise that we cannot analyze the
decision making of an alien civilization. This paper argues that we can draw
some inferences from the history of the Cold War and nuclear deterrence in
order to show that at least some attack scenarios are likely to be exaggerated.
In particular, it would seem to be unlikely that the humanity would be attacked
simply because it might, some time in the future, present a threat to the ETI.
Even if communication proves to be difficult, rational decision-makers should
avoid unprovoked attacks, because their success would be very difficult to
assure. In general, it seems believable that interstellar conflicts between
civilizations would remain rare. The findings advise caution for proposed
interstellar missions, however, as starfaring capability itself might be seen
as a threat. On the other hand, attempting to contact ETIs seems to be a
relatively low-risk strategy: paranoid ETIs must also consider the possibility
that the messages are a deception designed to lure out hostile civilizations
and preemptively destroy them.

$\pi_i(M_G)=0$ for $1<i<r$. We thus provide a unified point of view
systematizing known and new results in this direction for various different
classes of manifolds. The largest $r$ for which such an $M_G \in \CC$ can be
found is called the homotopical height $ht_\CC(G)$. Homotopical height provides
a dimensional obstruction to finding a $K(G,1)$ space within the given class
$\CC$, leading to a hierarchy of these classes in terms of ""softness"" or
""hardness"" \`a la Gromov. We show that the classes of closed contact, CR, and
almost complex manifolds as well as the class of (open) Stein manifolds are
soft.
  The classes $\SP$ and $\CA$ of closed symplectic and complex manifolds
exhibit intermediate ""softness"" in the sense that every finitely presented
group $G$ can be realized as the fundamental group of a manifold in $\SP$ and a
manifold in $\CA$. For these classes, $ht_\CC(G)$ provides a numerical
invariant for finitely presented groups. We give explicit computations of these
invariants for some standard finitely presented groups.
  We use the notion of homotopical height within the ""hard"" category of
K\""ahler groups to obtain partial answers to questions of Toledo regarding
second cohomology and second group cohomology of K\""ahler groups. We also
modify and generalize a construction due to Dimca, Papadima and Suciu to give a

work was motivated, in parts, by experiments reported at the IAEA 2010
conference [Y. Xu {\it et al}, Nucl. Fusion \textbf{51}, 062030] which showed a
decrease of long-range correlations during the application of RMPs. We derive
and apply a zero-dimensional predator-prey model coupling the Drift-Wave Zonal
Mode system [M. Leconte and P.H. Diamond, Phys. Plasmas \textbf{19}, 055903] to
the evolution of mean quantities. This model has both density gradient drive
and RMP amplitude as control parameters and predicts a novel type of transport
bifurcation in the presence of RMPs. This model allows a description of the
full L-H transition evolution with RMPs, including the mean sheared flow
evolution. The key results are: i) The L-I and I-H power thresholds \emph{both}
increase with RMP amplitude $|\bx|$, the relative increase of the L-I threshold
scales as $\Delta P_{\rm LI} \propto |\bx|^2 \nu_*^{-2} \gyro^{-2}$, where
$\nu_*$ is edge collisionality and $\gyro$ is the sound gyroradius. ii) RMPs
are predicted to \emph{decrease} the hysteresis between the forward and
back-transition. iii) Taking into account the mean density evolution, the
density profile - sustained by the particle source - has an increased turbulent
diffusion compared with the reference case without RMPs which provides one
possible explanation for the \emph{density pump-out} effect.

backscattering and near-lossless propagation in the fiber, we model the

method from statistical mechanics, to obtain closed-form results for the
ergodic mutual information, its variance as well as the outage probability for

removes duplicates from old data, thereby shifting fragmentation to old data

gaps as functions of three intensive quantities, the temperature, the quark
chemical potential and the external magnetic field. The nonzero values of the
mass gaps, chiral and diquark condensates, induce spontaneous chiral and color
symmetry breaking, respectively, and as a result two different phases of quark
matter appear. We find the transition curves between these phases as well as
the critical points in the QCD phase diagram in terms of the intensive
quantities. Imposing a constant strong magnetic field on these two phases, we
show that the mass gaps increase with the magnetic field and the symmetry
breaking region in the QCD phase diagram expands even to the larger values of
temperature and quark chemical potential. This phenomenon is a consequence of
the magnetic catalysis of dynamical symmetry breaking, which is proven before.

about pi(x)/phi(d).
  More precisely, we prove: Let 1\leq m<k be integers, let q be a prime power,

Its empirical gramian variant extends the application of the cross gramian to
nonlinear systems. Furthermore, for parametrized systems, the empirical
gramians can also be utilized for sensitivity analysis or parameter
identification and thus for parameter reduction. This work also introduces the
empirical joint gramian, which is derived from the empirical cross gramian. The
joint gramian not only allows a reduction of the parameter space, but also the
combined state and parameter space reduction, which is tested on a linear and a

seriously challenged. Recently, warm dark matter (WDM) remarkably rose as an
alternative of cold dark matter (CDM). In the literature, many attempts have
been made to determine the equation-of-state parameter (EoS) of WDM. However,
in most of the previous works, it is usually assumed that the EoS of dark
matter (DM) is constant (and usually the EoS of dark energy is also constant).
Obviously, this assumption is fairly restrictive. It is more natural to assume
a variable EoS for WDM (and dark energy). In the present work, we try to
constrain the EoS of variable WDM with the current cosmological observations.
We find that the best fits indicate WDM, while CDM is still consistent with the
current observational data. However, $\Lambda$CDM is still better than WDM
models from the viewpoint of goodness-of-fit. So, in order to distinguish WDM
and CDM, the further observations on the small/galactic scale are required. On
the other hand, in this work we also consider WDM whose EoS is constant, while
the role of dark energy is played by various models. We find that the
cosmological constraint on the constant EoS of WDM is fairly robust.

excitation of the tangling clustering instability even for small particles. The
tangling clustering instability in the temperature stratified turbulence is
essentially different from the inertial clustering instability that occurs in
non-stratified isotropic and homogeneous turbulence. While the inertial
clustering instability is caused by the centrifugal effect of the turbulent
eddies, the mechanism of the tangling clustering instability is related to the
temperature fluctuations generated by the tangling of the mean temperature
gradient by the velocity fluctuations. Temperature fluctuations produce
pressure fluctuations and cause particle clustering in regions with increased
pressure fluctuations. It is shown that the growth rate of the tangling
clustering instability is much larger than that of the inertial clustering
instability. It is found that depending on the parameters of the turbulence and
the mean temperature gradient there is a preferential particle size at which
the particle clustering due to the tangling clustering instability is more
effective. The particle number density inside the cluster after the saturation
of this instability can be in several orders of magnitude larger than the mean
particle number density. It is also demonstrated that the evaporation of
droplets drastically change the tangling clustering instability, e.g., it
increases the instability threshold in the droplet radius. The tangling
clustering instability is of a great importance, e.g., in atmospheric

removes the long-standing ambiguity in the relaxation time for bulk viscosity
thereby eliminating one of the uncertainties in the extraction of the shear

causes monopole current to oscillate periodically with flux defined as inner
product of field and area, whereas for particles carrying a fixed dipole
moment, the dipole current oscillates periodically with flux vector defined as
cross product of field and trajectory. Our analysis unifies the oscillation of
monopole or dipole currents in various devices, such as SQUID and spin-FET,
into the same physical picture. Second, we show that interference effects can
also happen in open trajectory devices that transport dipole currents, such as
spin Josephson effect, based on the non-gauge field nature of the interference
effects of dipole moments. In addition, we propose that the interference effect

beta decay is noted to occur via $W_L^{-}W_L^{-}$ mediation involving lighter
sterile neutrino exchanges. The next dominant contribution is found to be
through $W_L^{-}W_R^{-}$ mediation involving both light and heavy right-handed
neutrino or sterile neutrino exchanges. The quark-lepton symmetric origin of
the computed value of the Dirac neutrino mass matrix is also found to play a
crucial role in determining these and other results on lepton flavor violating
branching ratios for $\tau \rightarrow e + \gamma$, $\tau \rightarrow \mu +
\gamma$, and $\mu \rightarrow e + \gamma$ accessible to ongoing search

basic and succinct quantity for measuring popularity of users. However, the
number of followers can be manipulated in various ways; we can even buy
follows. Therefore, alternative popularity measures for Twitter users on the
basis of, for example, users' tweets and retweets, have been developed. In the
present work, we take a purely network approach to this fundamental question.
First, we find that two relatively distinct types of users possessing a large
number of followers exist, in particular for Japanese, Russian, and Korean
users among the seven language groups that we examined. A first type of user
follows a small number of other users. A second type of user follows
approximately the same number of other users as the number of follows that the
user receives. Then, we compare local (i.e., egocentric) followership networks
around the two types of users with many followers. We show that the second
type, which is presumably uninfluential users despite its large number of
followers, is characterized by high link reciprocity, a large number of friends
(i.e., those whom a user follows) for the followers, followers' high link
reciprocity, large clustering coefficient, large fraction of the second type of
users among the followers, and a small PageRank. Our network-based results
support that the number of followers used alone is a misleading measure of
user's popularity. We propose that the number of friends, which is simple to
measure, also helps us to assess the popularity of Twitter users.

grain-surface and bulk-ice chemistry in hot cores. Glycine (NH2CH2COOH), the
simplest amino acid, and related molecules such as glycinal, propionic acid and
propanal, are included in the chemical network. Glycine is found to form in
moderate abundance within and upon dust-grain ices via three radical-addition
mechanisms, with no single mechanism strongly dominant. Glycine production in
the ice occurs over temperatures ~40-120 K. Peak gas-phase glycine fractional
abundances lie in the range 8 x 10^{-11} - 8 x 10^{-9}, occuring at ~200 K, the
evaporation temperature of glycine. A gas-phase mechanism for glycine
production is tested and found insignificant, even under optimal conditions. A
new spectroscopic radiative-transfer model is used, allowing the translation
and comparison of the chemical-model results with observations of specific
sources. Comparison with the nearby hot-core source NGC 6334 IRS1 shows
excellent agreement with integrated line intensities of observed species,
including methyl formate. The results for glycine are consistent with the
current lack of a detection of this molecule toward other sources; the high
evaporation temperature of glycine renders the emission region extremely
compact. Glycine detection with ALMA is predicted to be highly plausible, for
bright, nearby sources with narrow emission lines. Photodissociation of water
and subsequent hydrogen-abstraction from organic molecules by OH, and NH2, are
crucial to the build-up of complex organic species in the ice. The inclusion of
alternative branches within the network of radical-addition reactions appears
important to the abundances of hot-core molecules; less favorable branching
ratios may remedy the anomalously high abundance of glycolaldehyde predicted by
this and previous models.

minerals, corresponding to a low contrast between surface and atmospheric dust,
while being observed at a fixed geometry. Minimizing the effect of the surface
reflectance properties on the AOD retrieval is the second principal asset of
our method. The method is based on the parametrization of the radiative
coupling between particles and gas determining, with local altimetry,
acquisition geometry, and the meteorological situation, the absorption band
depth of gaseous CO2. Because the last three factors can be predicted to some
extent, we can define a new parameter {\beta} that expresses specifically the
strength of the gas-aerosols coupling while directly depending on the AOD.
Combining estimations of {\beta} and top of the atmosphere radiance values
extracted from the observed spectra within the CO2 gas band at 2 {\mu}m, we
evaluate the AOD and the surface reflectance by radiative transfer inversion.
One should note that practically {\beta} can be estimated for a large variety
of mineral or icy surfaces with the exception of CO2 ice when its 2 {\mu}m
solid band is not sufficiently saturated. Validation of the proposed method
shows that it is reliable if two conditions are fulfilled: (i) the observation
conditions provide large incidence or/and emergence angles (ii) the aerosol are
vertically well mixed in the atmosphere. Experiments conducted on OMEGA nadir
looking observations as well as CRISM EPF acquisitions with incidence angles
higher than 65{\deg} and 33{\deg} respectively produce very satisfactory
results. Finally in a companion paper the method is applied to monitoring
atmospheric dust spring activity at high southern latitudes on Mars using
OMEGA.

these methods on empirical and synthetic model data. For almost all our cases,
the network representation that captures most relevant information is a
so-called exponential-threshold network. In these, each contact contributes
with a weight decreasing exponentially with time, and there is an edge between
a pair of vertices if the weight between them exceeds a threshold. Networks of
aggregated contacts over an optimally chosen time window perform almost as good
as the exponential-threshold networks. On the other hand, networks of
accumulated contacts over the entire sampling time, and networks of concurrent
partnerships, perform worse. We discuss these observations in the context of

properly accounted for, while the overall simulation time considerably improves
with respect to real-space, with a speed-up factor of 40 for a 1.5-nm-wide

discuss the accuracy of two commonly used approximations of the scattering
self-energies: the neglect of the off-diagonal entries in the mode-space
expressions and the neglect of the Hermitian part of the retarded self-energy.
While the latter is an acceptable approximation in most bias conditions, the
former is somewhat inaccurate when the device is in the off-state and optical
phonon scattering is essential in determining the current via band-to-band

Proca-Maxwell's massive electrodynamics is derived from the extend
current-density transformations. Proca-Maxwell's theory is found to be
invariant under the extended gauge transformations (current-charge density).
The Lorenz gauge condition is shown to express the photon charge conservation.
Any violation of Lorenz gauge (photon charge) or electronic charge conservation
would lead to spin zero scalar particles. This is manifested in
superconductivity. The total charge comprising the electron and photon is
always conserved. Owing to superconductivity, the photon charge is related to
electron charge by $e_p=\sqrt{\frac{m_p}{m_e}}\,\,e$. Photons inside

frequency radio halo connected to an eastern radio relic. Previous Chandra
observations hinted at the presence of an X-ray brightness edge at the position
of the relic, which may be a shock front. We analyze a deep observation of A521
recently performed with XMM-Newton in order to probe the cluster structure up
to the outermost regions covered by the radio emission. The cluster atmosphere
exhibits various brightness and temperature anisotropies. In particular, two
cluster cores appear to be separated by two cold fronts. We find two shock
fronts, one that was suggested by Chandra and that is propagating to the east,
and another to the southwestern cluster outskirt. The two main interacting
clusters appear to be separated by a shock heated region, which exhibits a
spatial correlation with the radio halo. The outer edge of the radio relic
coincides spatially with a shock front, suggesting this shock is responsible
for the generation of cosmic ray electrons in the relic. The propagation
direction and Mach number of the shock front derived from the gas density jump,
M = 2.4 +/- 0.2, are consistent with expectations from the radio spectral
index, under the assumption of Fermi I acceleration mechanism.

measurements made by the Helios-2 spacecraft at three positions between 0.29
and 0.9 AU. To derive the power spectral density (PSD) in $(k_\parallel,
k_\bot)$-space based on single-satellite measurements is a challenging task not
yet accomplished previously. Here we derive the spectrum
$\rm{PSD}_{\rm{2D}}$($\rm{k}_\parallel$, $\rm{k}_\bot$) from the spatial
correlation function $\rm{CF}_{\rm{2D}}(r_\parallel, r_\bot)$ by a
transformation according to the projection-slice theorem. We find the so
constructed PSDs to be distributed in k-space mainly along a ridge that is more
inclined toward the $\rm{k}_\bot$ than $\rm{k}_\parallel$ axis, a new result
which probably indicates preferential cascading of turbulent energy along the
$\rm{k}_\bot$ direction. Furthermore, this ridge of the distribution is found
to gradually get closer to the $\rm{k}_\bot$ axis, as the outer scale length of
the turbulence becomes larger while the solar wind flows further away from the
Sun. In the vicinity of the $\rm{k}_\parallel$ axis, there appears a minor
spectral component that probably corresponds to quasi-parallel Alfv\'enic
fluctuations. Their relative contribution to the total spectral density tends
to decrease with radial distance. These findings suggest that solar wind
turbulence undergoes an anisotropic cascade transporting most of its magnetic
energy towards larger $\rm{k}_\bot$, and that the anisotropy in the inertial
range is radially developing further at scales that are relatively far from the
ever increasing outer scale.

is significantly reduced. If this low abundance pertains also to the original
disk material, gas heating rates could be too low to efficiently drive
photoevaporation unless other processes can be identified. Alternatively, the

spectral weight that coincide with the emergence of surface conductivity are
disproportionate to any change in the total intensity of the O $1s$ core level

analysis of the photometry and three-dimensional kinematics of 47 Tuc and omega
Cen, by means of a new family of self-consistent axisymmetric rotating models.
The combined use of line-of-sight velocities and proper motions allows us to
obtain a global description of the internal dynamical structure of the objects
together with an estimate of their dynamical distances. The well-relaxed
cluster 47 Tuc is very well interpreted by our dynamical models; in particular,
internal rotation is found to explain the observed morphology. For the
partially relaxed cluster omega Cen, the selected model provides a good
representation of its complex three-dimensional kinematics, in general
qualitative agreement with the observed anisotropy profile, which is
characterized by tangential anisotropy in the outer parts; discrepancies are
found between the observed and the expected ellipticity profile and are
ascribed to the presence of a high degree of radial anisotropy in the
intermediate region and to its interplay with rotation.

proposed algorithms are novel in addressing a trade-off between active sensing

determined by the coupled nonlinear interactions of small-scale drift
turbulence and larger scale coherent nonlinear structures, such as zonal flows,
together with free energy sources such as temperature gradients.
Zero-dimensional models, designed to embody plausible physical narratives for
these interactions, can help identify the origin of enhanced energy confinement
and of transitions between confinement regimes. A prime zero-dimensional
paradigm is predator-prey or Lotka-Volterra. Here we extend a successful
three-variable (temperature gradient; microturbulence level; one class of
coherent structure) model in this genre [M A Malkov and P H Diamond, Phys.
Plasmas 16, 012504 (2009)], by adding a fourth variable representing a second
class of coherent structure. This requires a fourth coupled nonlinear ordinary
differential equation. We investigate the degree of invariance of the
phenomenology generated by the model of Malkov and Diamond, given this
additional physics. We study and compare the long-time behaviour of the
three-equation and four-equation systems, their evolution towards the final
state, and their attractive fixed points and limit cycles. We explore the
sensitivity of paths to attractors. It is found that, for example, an
attractive fixed point of the three-equation system can become a limit cycle of
the four-equation system. Addressing these questions - which we together refer
to as ""robustness"" for convenience, is particularly important for models which,
as here, generate sharp transitions in the values of system variables which may
replicate some key features of confinement transitions. Our results help
establish the robustness of the zero-dimensional model approach to capturing

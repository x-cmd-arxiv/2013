naturally as crossed product algebras. For example if the group $\Gamma$ acts
simply transitively on a homogeneous tree of finite degree with boundary

as affine buildings of type $\widetilde A_1$. The present paper is devoted to
the study of the analogous situation where a group $\G$ acts simply
transitively on the vertices of an affine building of type $\widetilde A_2$

generated by two Cuntz-Krieger algebras. Moreover we show that $\cross$ is

essence, the main results in Luo's article involve the following three points:
Finiteness for the number of zeros in the half plane to the left of the
critical line; an asymptotic expansion for the counting function measuring the
vertical distribution of zeros; and an asymptotic expansion for the counting
function measuring the horizontal distance of zeros from the critical line. In
the present article, we study the more complicated setting of distribution of
zeros of the derivative of the Selberg zeta function associated to a
non-compact, finite volume hyperbolic Riemann surface. There are numerous
difficulties which exist in the non-compact case that are not present in the
compact setting, beginning with the fact that in the non-compact case the
Selberg zeta function does not satisfy the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis.
To be more specific, we actually study the zeros of the derivative of ZH, where
Z is the Selberg zeta function and H is the Dirichlet series component of the
scattering matrix, both associated to an arbitrary finite-volume hyperbolic
Riemann surface. Our main results address finiteness of zeros in the half plane

nodes are assigned with continuous mobility. Three parameters are suggested
$\Delta$, $\Theta$ and $\lambda$ to correlate the results obtained using

Compressed sensing methods aim to construct a high quality approximation to any

sketching algorithms for high-volume data streams. The new class of matrices is
constructed by randomly subsampling rows from well-chosen incoherent matrix
constructions which already have a sub-linear number of rows. As a consequence,
fewer random bits than previously required are needed in order to select the

single parameter, the relative magnitude of spinning and walking in a single

the CMSSM we show that ultimate, but realistic, improvement in the
determination of the observable to about 5-10% around the Standard Model value
would strongly disfavor the A-funnel region, while not affecting much the other
favored regions. Second, we show that all the favored regions of the CMSSM will
be, for the most part, sensitive to direct dark matter searches in future
one-tonne detectors. A signal at low WIMP mass (<=450 GeV) and low
spin-independent cross section would then strongly favor the stau
coannihilation region while a signal at higher WIMP mass (~800 GeV to ~1.2 TeV)
would clearly point to the region where the neutralino is higgsino-like with
mass ~1 TeV. A nearly complete experimental testing of the CMSSM over multi-TeV
ranges of superpartner masses, far beyond the reach of direct SUSY searches at
the LHC, can therefore be achievable. In the NUHM, in contrast, similar favored
regions exist but a sample study reveals that even a precise determination of
BR(Bs->\mu\mu) would have a much less constraining power on the model,
including the A-funnel region. On the other hand, this could allow one to, by
detecting in one-tonne detectors a signal for 500 GeV<m_{\chi}<800 GeV,
strongly disfavor the CMSSM.

We derive the relationship between mixed correlations and the dynamical systems

the sample (scenario) approximation scheme to convert them into finitely many

simultaneous supportability of all links in the network and to guide an
iterative link removal procedure (the deflation approach). We exploit the
special structure of the SOCP approximation and custom-design an efficient

preserved. Moreover, the value of scaling coefficient C_{s} can be
significantly reduced in networks with asymmetric interference topology.

of polymer nanocomposites, in particular, switching to the conducting state in
relatively thick (tens of microns or more) of flexible PVC films is considered.
In previously published experimental results, change of conductivity by 10 or
more orders of magnitude occurred both in the absence of external influences
(spontaneously), and under the influence of an applied electric field, as well
as other initiating factors (such as uniaxial pressure) . In a model of hopping
conduction mechanism it is shown, that switching in the conduction states under
the action of external field significantly (by orders of magnitude) below
threshold can be associated with a high-resistance state instability that
results from the sequence of ""shorting"" (reversible soft breakdown) of narrow
insulating gaps between regions with relatively high conductivity. Increasing
the field strength in the remaining insulating gaps ultimately leads to the
formation of a conducting channel between the external electrodes and switching
conductivity of the composite film sample in a state of high conductivity. This
cascade model is essentially based on the transition from the usual description
of the charge tunneling through single independent insulating gap to take into
account correlations between adjacent gaps. In the frame of developed model
other ""anomalies"" such as exponential dependence of the resistance on the
sample thickness, pressure, and other influences can be qualitative explained.
An analogy of the model with a cascading breakdown of avalanche transistors is
also considered.

Rome, Italy, on March 23rd, 2013, as part of the sixteenth edition of the
European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS 2013).
  Research in term and graph rewriting ranges from theoretical questions to
practical issues. Computing with graphs handles the sharing of common
subexpressions in a natural and seamless way, and improves the efficiency of
computations in space and time. Sharing is ubiquitous in several research
areas, as witnessed by the modelling of first- and higher-order term rewriting
by (acyclic or cyclic) graph rewriting, the modelling of biological or chemical
abstract machines, and the implementation techniques of programming languages:
many implementations of functional, logic, object-oriented, concurrent and
mobile calculi are based on term graphs. Term graphs are also used in automated
theorem proving and symbolic computation systems working on shared structures.
The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers working in different
domains on term and graph transformation and to foster their interaction, to
provide a forum for presenting new ideas and work in progress, and to enable
newcomers to learn about current activities in term graph rewriting.
  These proceedings contain six accepted papers and the abstracts of two
invited talks. All submissions were subject to careful refereeing. The topics
of accepted papers range over a wide spectrum, including theoretical aspects of
term graph rewriting, concurrency, semantics as well as application issues of
term graph transformation.

band calculations indicate that the quasi-particle spectra are likely
associated with the hybridization between the extrinsic substrate-induced Dirac
states of Bi bilayer and the intrinsic surface Dirac states of Bi2Te3 film at
close energy proximity. Without such hybridization, only single-particle Dirac
spectra are observed in a single Bi bilayer grown on Bi2Se3, where the
extrinsic Dirac states Bi bilayer and the intrinsic Dirac states of Bi2Se3 are
well separated in energy. The possible origins of many-body interactions are
discussed. Our findings provide a means to manipulate topological surface

improved. From the chemical point of view, the high-temperature
superconductivity is associated with additional $\pi$ bonding along chains of
covalently bonded ions via a delocalized $\pi$ orbital, just like in cuprates.
From the physical point of view, as the data on iron pnictides show, the
superconductivity is associated with a FeAs layer transition into the state
similar to a macroscopic quantum system characterized by a highly correlated
electron state, formation of two-dimensional crystals of electron pairs with
quantized energy levels, and a strong Coulomb interaction between these
crystals. Superconductivity in such a system is accomplished by a
two-dimensional Wigner crystal consisting of one-dimensional Wigner crystals
formed by bosons, i.e., singlet electron pairs that are in the same
quasi-one-dimensional state extending along the ion chain, which corresponds to
a delocalized $\pi$ orbital in chemistry. The model applicability to three
different classes of materials (cuprates, picene, iron pnictides) indicates
that it can prove useful for development of the theory of superconductivity
taking into consideraion the highly correlated state of valence electrons and
strong Coulomb interactions between the electrons.

Here, we analyse and quantify the effects of entanglement in the generalized

the use of any arbitrary single qubit unitary gate is permitted to create
superposed states. Our analysis has been firstly on a noise free environment
and secondly in the presence of noise. In the absence of noise, we establish a
relation between the concurrence and the amplitude of the final state thereby
showing the explicit effects of entanglement on the same. Moreover, the effects
of noisy channels, namely amplitude and phase damping channels are studied. We
investigate the amount of quantum correlation in the states obtained after the
phase inversion stage of the algorithm followed by interaction of those states
with the noisy environment. The quantum correlations are quantified by
geometric discord. It has been revealed that the states generated after the
effect of amplitude damping on the phase inverted states of the quantum search
algorithm possess non-zero quantum correlation even when entanglement is

radius is not unique and the radii are randomly distributed in a certain range.
This is performed by averaging the elastic electron-proton differential cross
section over the form factor cut-off. By using a dipole form factor and fitting
the middle value of the cut-off to the low $Q^2$ Mainz data, we found the
lowest $\chi^2/N$ for a cut-off $\Lambda=0.8203\pm 0.0003$ GeV, which
corresponds to a proton charge radius $r_E=0.8333\pm 0.0004$ fm. The result is
compatible with the recent precision measurement of the Lamb shift in muonic
hydrogen as well as recent calculations using more sophisticated techniques.
Our result indicates that the relative variation of the form factor cut-off
should be around 21.5%. Based on this result we have investigated effects of
the nucleon radius variation on the symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) and the
neutron star matter (NSM) by considering the excluded volume effect in our
calculation. The mass-radius relation of neutron star is found to be sensitive
to this variation. The nucleon effective mass in the SNM as well as the
equation of state of both the SNM and the NSM exhibit a similar sensitivity.

dense sampling of large-scale structure tracers with spectroscopic redshift,

Here we present an alternative route of the BAO analysis that uses the
cross-correlation of sparse spectroscopic tracers with a much denser
photometric sample, where the spectroscopic tracers can be quasars or bright,
rare galaxies that are easier to access spectroscopically. We show that
measurements of the cross-correlation as a function of the transverse comoving
separation rather than the angular separation avoid a smearing of the BAO
feature without mixing the different scales at different redshifts in the
projection, even for a wide redshift slice $\Delta z\simeq 1$. The bias,
scatter, and catastrophic redshift errors of the photometric sample affect only
the overall normalization of the cross-correlation which can be marginalized
over when constraining the angular diameter distance. As a specific example, we
forecast an expected accuracy of the BAO geometrical test via the
cross-correlation of the SDSS and BOSS spectroscopic quasar sample with a dense
photometric galaxy sample that is assumed to have a full overlap with the
SDSS/BOSS survey region. We show that this cross-correlation BAO analysis
allows us to measure the angular diameter distances to a fractional accuracy of
about 10% at each redshift bin over $1\simlt z\simlt 3$, if the photometric

microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) is investigated. The model couples the
electric potential to the deformation of the membrane, the deflection of the
membrane being caused by application of a voltage difference across the device.
More precisely, the electrostatic potential is a harmonic function in the
angular domain that is partly bounded by the deformable membrane. The gradient
trace of the electric potential on this free boundary part acts as a source
term in the governing equation for the membrane deformation. The main feature
of the model considered herein is that, unlike most previous research, the
small deformation assumption is dropped, and curvature for the deformation of
the membrane is taken into account what leads to a quasilinear parabolic
equation. The free boundary problem is shown to be well-posed, locally in time
for arbitrary voltage values and globally in time for small voltages values.
Furthermore, existence of asymptotically stable steady-state configurations is
proved in case of small voltage values as well as non-existence of
steady-states if the applied voltage difference is large. Finally, convergence
of solutions of the free boundary problem to the solutions of the
well-established small aspect ratio model is shown.

structural and genomic data for many biological sequences. This increased
availability of heterogeneous biological data has resulted in biological
applications where a multiple sequence alignment (msa) is required for aligning
similar features, where a feature is described in structural, functional or
evolutionary terms. In these applications, for a given set of sequences,
depending on the feature of interest the optimal msa is likely to be different,
and sequence similarity can only be used as a rough initial estimate on the
accuracy of an msa. This has motivated the growth in template based heuristics
that supplement the sequence information with evolutionary, structural and
functional data and exploit feature similarity instead of sequence similarity
to construct multiple sequence alignments that are biologically more accurate.
However, current frameworks for designing template based heuristics do not
allow the user to explicitly specify information that can help to classify
features into types and associate weights signifying the relative importance of
a feature with respect to other features. In this paper, we first provide a
mechanism where as a part of the template information the user can explicitly
specify for each feature, its type, and weight. The type is to classify the
features into different categories based on their characteristics and the
weight signifies the relative importance of a feature with respect to other
features in that sequence. Second, we exploit the above information to define
scoring models for pair-wise sequence alignment that assume segment
conservation as opposed to single character (residue) conservation. Finally, we
present a fast progressive alignment based heuristic framework that helps in
constructing a global msa efficiently.

hybridizing locally with conduction electrons of a metallic host. Such a
cluster is the simplest to exhibit frustration - an important generic feature
of many complex molecular systems in which different interactions compete.
Here, low-energy doublet states of the trimer are favored by effective exchange
interactions produced by strong electronic repulsion in localized impurity
orbitals. Parity symmetry protects a level-crossing of such states on tuning
microscopic parameters, while an avoided crossing arises in the general
distorted case. On coupling to a metallic host, the behavior is shown to be
immensely rich, since collective quantum many-body effects now also compete. In
particular, impurity degrees of freedom are totally screened at low
temperatures in a Kondo-screened Fermi liquid phase, while degenerate ground
states persist in a local moment phase. Local frustration drives the quantum
phase transition between the two, which may be first order or of
Kosterlitz-Thouless type, depending on symmetries. Unusual mechanisms for local
moment formation and Kondo screening are found, due to the orbital structure of
the impurity trimer. Our results are of relevance for triple quantum dot
devices. The problem is studied by a combination of analytical arguments and
the numerical renormalization group.

an isothermal source structure as well as with a non-uniform spherical
structure. For non-uniform source models one abundance jump for dimethyl ether
is sufficient to fit the emission, but two components are needed for the
isothermal models. This suggests that dimethyl ether is present in an extended
region of the envelope and traces a non-uniform density and temperature
structure. Both types of models furthermore suggest that most dimethyl ether is
present in gas that is warmer than 100 K, but a smaller fraction of 5%-28% is
present at temperatures between 70 and 100 K. The dimethyl ether present in
this cooler gas is likely formed in the solid state, while gas phase formation
probably is dominant above 100 K. Finally, the v11=1 and v15=1 torsionally

non-spinning components. We investigate the relative contribution to the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the three different phases of the coalescence:
inspiral, merger and ringdown. We show that merger and ringdown contribute to a
substantial fraction of the total SNR over a large portion of the mass
parameter space, although in a limited portion the SNR is dominated by the
inspiral phase. We further identify three regions in the IMRAC mass-space in
which: (i) inspiral-only searches could be performed with losses in detection
rates L in the range 10% < L < 27%, (ii) searches based on inspiral-only
templates lead to a loss in detection rates in the range 27% < L < 50%$, and
(iii) templates that include merger and ringdown are essential to prevent
losses in detection rates greater than 50%. We investigate the effectiveness
with which the inspiral-only portion of the IMRAC waveform space is covered by
comparing several existing waveform families in this regime. Our results
reinforce the importance of extensive numerical relativity simulations of

2d-Liouville quantum gravity. In this note, we discuss the construction of the
associated Dirichlet form, following essentially \cite{fuku} and the techniques
introduced in \cite{GRV}. Then we carry out the analysis of the Liouville

  One of the motivations which led to introduce the Liouville Brownian motion

of this new stochastic process. One possible approach was to use the theory
developed for example in \cite{stollmann,sturm1,sturm2}, whose aim is to
capture the ""geometry"" of the underlying space out of the Dirichlet form of a
process living on that space. More precisely, under some mild hypothesis on the
regularity of the Dirichlet form, they provide an intrinsic metric which is
interpreted as an extension of Riemannian geometry applicable to non
differential structures. We prove that the needed mild hypotheses are satisfied
but that the associated intrinsic metric unfortunately vanishes, thus showing
that renormalization theory remains out of reach of the metric aspect of
Dirichlet forms.

filaments, but its response to the stresses carried by these filaments is
largely unexplored. We report here the results of studies of the translational
and rotational dynamics of the nuclei of single fibroblast cells, with the
effects of cell migration suppressed by plating onto fibronectin-coated
micro-fabricated patterns. Patterns of the same area but different shapes
and/or aspect ratio were used to study the effect of cell geometry on the
dynamics. On circles, squares and equilateral triangles, the nucleus undergoes
persistent rotational motion, while on high-aspect-ratio rectangles of the same
area it moves only back and forth. The circle and the triangle showed
respectively the largest and the smallest angular speed. We show that our
observations can be understood through a hydrodynamic approach in which the
nucleus is treated as a highly viscous inclusion residing in a less viscous
fluid of orientable filaments endowed with active stresses. Lowering actin
contractility selectively by introducing blebbistatin at low concentrations
drastically reduced the speed and persistence time of the angular motion of the
nucleus. Time-lapse imaging of actin revealed a correlated hydrodynamic flow
around the nucleus, with profile and magnitude consistent with the results of

been observed with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) and the Submillimeter
Telescope (SMT). The 1.1 mm continuum map obtained with the SMA reveals that
the two sources contain spatially compact components, suggesting that they
harbor protostars. The N2D+ and N2H+ J=3-2 maps were obtained by combining the
SMA and SMT data. The N2D+ map clearly shows two peaks at the continuum
positions. The N2H+ map also peaks at the continuum positions, but is more
dominated by the spatially extended component. The N2D+/N2H+ ratio was
estimated to be ~ 0.2 at the positions of both B1-bN and B1-bS. The derived
N2D+/N2H+ ratio is comparable to those of the prestellar cores in the late
evolutionary stage and the class 0 protostars in the early evolutionary stage.
Although B1-bN is bright in N2H+ and N2D+, this source was barely seen in
H13CO+. This implies that the depletion of carbon-bearing molecules is
significant in B1-bN. The chemical property suggests that B1-bN is in the
earlier evolutionary stage as compared to B1-bS with the H13CO+ counterpart.
The N2H+ and N2D+ lines show that the radial velocities of the two sources are
different by ~ 0.9 km s-1. However, the velocity pattern along the line through
B1-bN and B1-bS suggests that these two sources were not formed out of a single
rotating cloud. It is likely that the B1-b core consists of two velocity
components, each of which harbors a very young source.

mortality that is partly related to the expulsion of dust and gas in their
early phases caused by radiation pressure from hot stars and supernovae.
Near-infrared (J-K)-Mk diagrams of young stellar clusters in nearby spiral
galaxies show a bi-modal distribution that is consistent with a fast decline of
their intrinsic extinction at an early epoch.
  The distinct features in the color-magnitude diagrams (CMD) and the fast
change of colors for the youngest clusters allow us to place constraints on
their early evolutionary phases, including the time scale for the decreasing
extinction caused for instance by gas and dust expulsion.
  Monte Carlo simulations of cluster populations were performed using the
power-law distribution function g(M, t) ~ M^a t^gam. Integrated colors were
computed from Starburst99 models. The simulated near-infrared CMD were compared
with those observed for six grand-design, spiral galaxies using statistical
goodness-of-fit tests.
  The CMDs indicate a significant mortality of young, massive clusters with gam
= -1.4 +-0.5. High initial extinction Av = 8-11m and strong nebular emission
are required to reproduce the bi-modal color distributions of the clusters. An
extended star formation phase of longer than 5 Myr is suggested. The reduction
of the internal extinction of the clusters starts during their active star
formation and lasts for a period of 5-10 Myr.

is rapidly gaining popularity in applications where imaging optics are

general approach to lensless imaging without spectral bandwidth limitations or
sample requirements. We use two time-delayed coherent light pulses, and show
that scanning the pulse-to-pulse time delay allows the reconstruction of
diffraction-limited images for all spectral components in the pulse. Moreover,
an iterative phase retrieval algorithm is introduced, which uses these
spectrally resolved Fresnel diffraction patterns to obtain high-resolution
images of complex extended objects without any support requirements. We
demonstrate this two-pulse imaging method with octave-spanning visible light
sources (in both transmission and reflection geometries), and with broadband
extreme-ultraviolet radiation from a high-harmonic source. This demonstrates
that our approach enables effective use of low-flux ultra-broadband sources,
such as table-top soft-X-ray systems, for high-resolution imaging.

promising progenitors for supermassive black holes (SMBHs) observed in the
early universe at z>7. It has been postulated that SMSs forms through very
rapid mass accretion onto a protostar at a high rate exceeding 0.01 Msun/yr.
According to recent studies, such rapidly accreting protostars evolve into
""supergiant protostars"", i.e. protostars consisting of a bloated envelope and a
contracting core, similar to giant star. However, like massive stars as well as
giant stars, both of which are known to be pulsationally unstable, supergiant
protostars may also be also unstable to launch strong pulsation-driven
outflows. If this is the case, the stellar growth via accretion will be
hindered by the mass loss. We here study the pulsational stability of the
supergiant protostars in the mass range M<10^3 Msun through the method of the
linear perturbation analysis. We find that the supergiant protostars with M>600
Msun and very high accretion rate Mdot>1.0 Msun/yr are unstable due to the
kappa mechanism. The pulsation is excited in the He^+ ionization layer in the
envelope. Even under a conservative assumption that all the pulsation energy is
converted into the kinetic energy of the outflows, the mass-loss rate is ~10^-3
Msun/yr, which is lower than the accretion rate by more than two orders of
magnitude. We thus conclude that the supergiant protostars should grow stably
via rapid accretion at least in the mass range we studied. As long as the rapid
accretion is maintained in the later stage, protostars will become SMSs, which
eventually produce seeds for the high-z SMBHs.

the IBIS/ISGRI detector pixels corresponding to the projection of a bright
source through mask elements affected by some defects. These defects are most
likely associated with screws and glue fixing the IBIS mask to its support.
Following these major improvements introduced in OSA 9, a second order
correction is still required to further remove the residual noise, now at a
level of 0.2-1% of the brightest source in the field of view. In order to
improve our knowledge of the IBIS mask transparency, a calibration campaign has
been carried out during 2010-2012. We present here the analysis of these data,
together with archival observations of the Crab and Cyg X-1, that allowed us to
build a composite image of the mask defects and to investigate the origin of
the residual noise in the IBIS/ISGRI images. Thanks to this study, we were able
to point out a simple modification of the ISGRI analysis software that allows
to significantly improve the quality of the images in which bright sources are
detected at the edge of the field of view. Moreover, a refinement of the area
excluded by the ghost busters module is considered, and preliminary results
show improvements to be further tested. Finally, this study indicates further
directions to be investigated for improving the ISGRI sensitivity, such as
taking into account the thickness of the screws in the mask model or studying
the possible discrepancy between the modeled and actual mask element bridges.

the evolution of the distribution function of pulsars over the spin period and
find both the steady-state and the time-dependent solutions. Using the recent
results on the X-ray efficiency dependence on pulsar characteristic age, we
then compute the X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of rotation-powered pulsars.
In a general case it has a broken power-law shape with a high luminosity
cutoff, which depends on the distributions of the birth spin period and the
magnetic field.
  Using the observed XLF of sources in the nearby galaxies and the condition
that the pulsar XLF does not exceed that, we find the allowed region for the
parameters describing the birth period distribution. We find that the mean
pulsar period should be greater than 10-40 ms. These results are consistent
with the constraints obtained from the X-ray luminosity of core-collapse
supernovae. We estimate that the contribution of the rotation-powered pulsars
to the ULX population is at a level exceeding 3 per cent. For a wide birth
period distribution, this fraction grows with luminosity and above 10E40 erg/s
pulsars can dominate the ULX population.

We propose that this distinction underlies the BH information-loss paradox, the
apparent absence of BH hair, the so-called trans-Planckian problem and the
recent ""firewall"" controversy. We argue that the correct prescription is to
first integrate out the fluctuations of the background geometry and only then
evaluate matter observables. The basic idea is illustrated using a system of
two strongly coupled harmonic oscillators, with the heavier oscillator
representing the background. We then apply our proposal to matter fields near a
BH horizon, initially treating the matter fields as classical and the
background as semiclassical. In this case, the average value of the associated
current does not vanish; so that it is possible, in principle, to measure the
global charge of the BH. Then the matter is, in addition to the background,
treated quantum mechanically. We show that the average energy density of matter
as seen by an asymptotic observer is finite and proportional to the BH entropy,
rather than divergent. We discuss the implications of our results for the
various controversial issues concerning BH physics.

during turbulent multi-island magnetic reconnection. The particle acceleration
model is constructed for an ensemble of islands which produce adiabatic
compression of the particles. The model takes into account the statistical
fluctuations in the compression rate experienced by the particles during their
transport in the acceleration region. The evolution of the particle
distribution function is described as a simultaneous first and second-order
Fermi acceleration process. While the efficiency of the first-order process is
controlled by the average rate of compression, the second order process
involves the variance in the compression rate. Moreover, the acceleration
efficiency associated with the second-order process involves both the Eulerian
properties of the compression field and the Lagrangian properties of the
particles. The stochastic contribution to the acceleration is non-resonant and
can dominate the systematic part in the case of a large variance in the
compression rate. The model addresses the role of the second-order process, how
the latter can be related to the large-scale turbulent transport of particles
and explains some features of the numerical simulations of particle
acceleration by multi-island contraction during magnetic reconnection.

the emission mechanism of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), is difficult to implement in
practice because of poor statistics. We present a new method for pulse-wise
time-resolved spectral study of the individual pulses of GRBs, using the fact
that many spectral parameters are either constants or smooth functions of time.
We use this method for the two pulses of GRB 081221, the brightest GRB with
separable pulses. We choose, from the literature, a set of possible models
which includes the Band model, blackbody with a power-law (BBPL), a collection
of black bodies with a smoothly varying temperature profile, along with a
power-law (mBBPL), and two blackbodies with a power-law (2BBPL). First, we
perform time-resolved study to confirm the spectral parameter variations, and
then construct the new model to perform a joint spectral fit. We find that any
photospheric emission in terms of black bodies is required mainly in the rising
parts of the pulses and the falling part can be adequately explained in terms
of the Band model, with the low energy photon index within the regime of
synchrotron model. Interestingly, we find that 2BBPL is comparable or sometimes
even better, though marginally, than the Band model, in all episodes.
Consistent results are also obtained for the brightest GRB of Fermi era --- GRB
090618. We point out that the method is generic enough to test any spectral
model with well defined parameter variations.

HERMES experiment to improve measurements of hard exclusive processes in
charged-lepton nucleon scattering. Here, deeply virtual Compton scattering is
of particular interest as this process provides constraints on generalised
parton distributions that give access to the total angular momenta of quarks
within the nucleon. The HERMES recoil detector was designed to improve the
selection of exclusive events by a direct measurement of the four-momentum of
the recoiling particle. It consisted of three components: two layers of
double-sided silicon strip sensors inside the HERA beam vacuum, a two-barrel
scintillating fibre tracker, and a photon detector. All sub-detectors were
located inside a solenoidal magnetic field with an integrated field strength of
1 T. The recoil detector was installed in late 2005. After the commissioning of
all components was finished in September 2006, it operated stably until the end
of data taking at HERA end of June 2007. The present paper gives a brief
overview of the physics processes of interest and the general detector design.
The recoil detector components, their calibration, the momentum reconstruction

molecular emission line observations in the literature. S88-B appears to
present a similar geometry to the well-known star forming region M17, in that
there is an edge-on eastward progression from ionized to molecular gas. The
detected magnetic fields appear to mirror this eastward transition; we detected
line-of-sight magnetic fields ranging from 90-400 \mu G, with the lowest values
of the field to the southwest of the S88B-1 continuum peak, and the highest
values to its northeast. We used the detected fields to assess the importance
of the magnetic field in S88B by a number of methods; we calculated the ratio
of thermal to magnetic pressures, we calculated the critical field necessary to
completely support the cloud against self-gravity and compared it to the
observed field, and we calculated the ratio of mass to magnetic flux in terms
of the critical value of this parameter. All these methods indicated that the
magnetic field in S88B is dynamically significant, and should provide an

extensively used tool for dimension reduction and inference for functional
data. The selection of the number, d, of the FPC's to be used in a specific
procedure has attracted a fair amount of attention, and a number of reasonably
effective approaches exist. Intuitively, they assume that the functional data
can be sufficiently well approximated by a projection onto a finite-dimensional
subspace, and the error resulting from such an approximation does not impact
the conclusions. This has been shown to be a very effective approach, but it is
desirable to understand the behavior of many inferential procedures by
considering the projections on subspaces spanned by an increasing number of the
FPC's. Such an approach reflects more fully the infinite-dimensional nature of
functional data, and allows to derive procedures which are fairly insensitive
to the selection of d. This is accomplished by considering limits as d tends to
infinity with the sample size.
  We propose a specific framework in which we let d tend to infinity by
deriving a normal approximation for the two-parameter partial sum process of
the scores \xi_{i,j} of the i-th function with respect to the j-th FPC. Our
approximation can be used to derive statistics that use segments of
observations and segments of the FPC's. We apply our general results to derive
two inferential procedures for the mean function: a change-point test and a
two-sample test. In addition to the asymptotic theory, the tests are assessed
through a small simulation study and a data example.

networks. We define social resilience as the ability of a community to
withstand changes. We do not argue about the cause of such changes, but
concentrate on their impact. Changes may cause users to leave, which may
trigger further leaves of others who lost connection to their friends. This may
lead to cascades of users leaving. A social network is said to be resilient if
the size of such cascades can be limited. To quantify resilience, we use the
k-core analysis, to identify subsets of the network in which all users have at
least k friends. These connections generate benefits (b) for each user, which
have to outweigh the costs (c) of being a member of the network. If this
difference is not positive, users leave. After all cascades, the remaining
network is the k-core of the original network determined by the cost-to-benefit
c/b ratio. By analysing the cumulative distribution of k-cores we are able to
calculate the number of users remaining in each community. This allows us to
infer the impact of the c/b ratio on the resilience of these online
communities. We find that the different online communities have different
k-core distributions. Consequently, similar changes in the c/b ratio have a
different impact on the amount of active users. As a case study, we focus on
the evolution of Friendster. We identify time periods when new users entering
the network observed an insufficient c/b ratio. This measure can be seen as a
precursor of the later collapse of the community. Our analysis can be applied
to estimate the impact of changes in the user interface, which may temporarily
increase the c/b ratio, thus posing a threat for the community to shrink, or
even to collapse.

was possible for density functional theory as well, one could reduce in such

theorem is applicable in a density-functional framework. By employing numerical

Hartree-exchange-correlation potential is not periodic with the external
frequency only. Using an analytically solvable example we demonstrate that, in

\kappa$ and by additional measurements on the phononic reference compounds
Y$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ and DyYTi$_2$O$_7$, we are able to separate the phononic and
the magnetic contributions to the total heat transport, i.e. $\kappa_{ph}$ and
$\kappa_{mag}$, respectively, which both depend on the magnetic field. The
field dependent $\kappa_{ph}$ arises from lattice distortions due to
magnetic-field induced torques on the non-collinear magnetic moments of the Dy
ions. For $\kappa_{mag}$, we observe a highly anisotropic magnetic-field
dependence, which correlates with the corresponding magnetization data
reflecting the different magnetic-field induced spin-ice ground states. The
magnitude of $\kappa_{mag}$ increases with the degree of the ground-state
degeneracy. This anisotropic field dependence as well as various hysteresis
effects suggest that $\kappa_{mag}$ is essentially determined by the mobility
of the magnetic monopole excitations in spin ice.

[Fe/H], Mstar, Rstar), and planetary (Mpl, Rpl, Teq) physical properties of
known transiting planets using a consistent methodology and homogeneous
high-quality dataset. Four spectral analysis techniques are independently
applied to a Keck+HIRES spectrum of WASP-13 considering two distinct cases:
unconstrained parameters, and constrained log g from transit light curves. We
check the derived stellar temperature against that from a different temperature
diagnostic based on an INT+IDS H{\alpha} spectrum. The four unconstrained
analyses render results that are in good agreement, and provide an improvement
of 50% in the precision of Teff, and of 85% in [Fe/H] with respect to the
WASP-13 discovery paper. The planetary parameters are then derived via the
Monte-Carlo-Markov-Chain modeling of the radial velocity and light curves, in
iteration with stellar evolutionary models to derive realistic uncertainties.
WASP-13 (1.187 +- 0.065 Msun; 1.574 +- 0.048 Rsun) hosts a Saturn-mass,
transiting planet (0.500 +- 0.037 MJup; 1.407 +- 0.052 RJup), and is at the end
of its main-sequence lifetime (4-5.5 Gyr). Our analysis of WASP-13 showcases
that both a detailed stellar characterization, and transit modeling are
necessary to well determine the fundamental properties of planetary systems,
which are paramount in identifying and determining empirical relationships
between transiting planets and their hosts.

regarded as a cross section for virtual $\gamma^*p$ scattering, is hadronic in
nature. This implies that its growth is limited by the Froissart bound at high
hadronic energies, giving a $\ln^2 (1/x)$ bound on $F_2^{\gamma p}$ as Bjorken
$x\rightarrow 0$. The same bound holds for the individual quark distributions.
In earlier work, we obtained a very accurate global fit to the combined HERA
data on $F_2^{\gamma p}$ using a fit function which respects the Froissart
bound at small $x$, and is equivalent in its $x$ dependence to the function
used successfully to describe all high energy hadronic cross sections,
including $\gamma p$ scattering. We extrapolate that fit by a factor of
$\lesssim$3 beyond the HERA region in the natural variable $\ln(1/x)$ to the
values of $x$ down to $x=10^{-14}$ and use the results to derive the quark
distributions needed for the reliable calculation of neutrino cross sections at
energies up to $E_\nu=10^{17}$ GeV. These distributions do not satisfy the
Feynman ""wee parton"" assumption, that they all converge toward a common
distribution $xq(x,Q^2)$ at small $x$ and large $Q^2$. This was used in some
past calculations to express the dominant neutrino structure function
$F_2^{\nu(\bar{\nu})}$ directly in terms of $F_2^{\gamma p}$. We show that the
correct distributions nevertheless give results for $F_2^{\nu(\bar{\nu})}$
which differ only slightly from those obtained assuming that the wee parton
limit holds. In two Appendices, we develop simple analytic results for the
effects of QCD evolution and operator-product corrections on the distribution
functions at small $x$, and show that these effects amount mainly to shifting
the values of $\ln(1/x)$ in the initial distributions.

historically correlated securities. When divergence is underway, i.e., one
stock moves up while the other moves down, a pairs trade is entered which
consists of a pair to short the outperforming stock and to long the
underperforming one. Such a strategy bets the ""spread"" between the two would
eventually converge. In this paper, a difference of the pair is governed by a
mean-reverting model. The objective is to trade the pair so as to maximize an
overall return. A fixed commission cost is charged with each transaction. In
addition, a stop-loss limit is imposed as a state constraint. The associated
HJB equations (quasi-variational inequalities) are used to characterize the
value functions. It is shown that the solution to the optimal stopping problem
can be obtained by solving a number of quasi-algebraic equations. We provide a

when his jobs get processed, Bob wishes to learn about the pattern (size and
timing) of jobs of Alice. Depending on the context, knowledge of this pattern
could have serious implications on Alice's privacy and security. For instance,
shared routers can reveal traffic patterns, shared memory access can reveal
cloud usage patterns, and suchlike. We present a formal framework to study the
information leakage in shared resource schedulers using the pattern estimation
error as a performance metric. The first-come-first-serve (FCFS) scheduling
policy and time-division-multiple-access (TDMA) are identified as two extreme
policies on the privacy metric, FCFS has the least, and TDMA has the highest.
However, on performance based metrics, such as throughput and delay, it is well
known that FCFS significantly outperforms TDMA. We then derive two parametrized
policies, accumulate and serve, and proportional TDMA, which take two different
approaches to offer a tunable trade-off between privacy and performance.

section for virtual $\gamma^*p$ scattering, has a saturated Froissart-bounded
form behaving as $\ln^2 (1/x)$ at small $x$. This form provides an excellent
fit to the low $x$ HERA data, including the very low $Q^2$ regions, and can be
extrapolated reliably to small $x$ using the natural variable $\ln(1/x)$. We
used our fit to derive quark distributions for values of $x$ down to
$x=10^{-14}$. We use those distributions here to evaluate ultra-high energy
(UHE) cross sections for neutrino scattering on an isoscalar nucleon,
$N=(n+p)/2$, up to laboratory neutrino energies $E_\nu \sim 10^{16}$-$10^{17}$
GeV where there are now limits on neutrino fluxes. We estimate that these cross
sections are accurate to $\sim$2% at the highest energies considered, with the
major uncertainty coming from the errors in the parameters that were needed to
fit $F_2^{\gamma p}(x,Q^2)$. We compare our results to recently published
neutrino cross sections derived from NLO parton distribution functions, which
become much larger at high energies because of the use of power-law
extrapolations of quark distributions to small $x$. We argue that our
calculation of the UHE $\nu N$ cross sections is the best one can make based
the existing experimental deep inelastic scattering data. Further, we show that
the strong interaction Froissart bound of $\ln^2 (1/x)$ on $F_2^{\gamma p}$
translates to an exact bound of $\ln^3E_\nu$ for leading-order-weak $\nu N$
scattering. The energy dependence of $\nu N$ total cross section measurements
consequently has important implications for hadronic interactions at enormous
cms (center-of-mass) energies not otherwise accessible.

show that this modulation pattern can be quantitatively explained as due to

algebra of fermion bilinears behind this expression is shown to have an

function (deformed by external potentials) is essentially a tau function of the

characterized by a factorization problem of $\ZZ\times\ZZ$ matrices as well.
The associated Lax operators turn out to be quotients of first order difference

distance magic if and only if $n+m \not \equiv 2 \pmod 4$. We also show that if
$n+m \equiv 2 \pmod 4$, then there does not exist a group $\Gamma$ of order
$n+m$ such that there exists a $\Gamma$-distance labeling for $K_{m,n}$.

logarithmic corrected gravitational force of a primary one. This kind of
correction was introduced by Fabris et al. (2009). We derive two equations to
compute the rate of change of the periastron w.r.t. the eccentric anomaly and
its total variation over one revolution, In a kinematical sense, this influence
produces an apsidal motion. We perform numerical estimations for Mercury and
for the companion star of the pulsar PSR 1913+16. We also consider the case of
the artificial Earth satellite GRACE-A, but the results present a low degree of
reliability from a practical standpoint

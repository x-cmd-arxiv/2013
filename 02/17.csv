peculiar electrical properties that arise from its random rotational
configurations. Our experiments on CVD-grown graphene from Cu foil and
transferred onto Si substrates, with an oxide layer of 100 nm, reveal
naturally-produced bi-layer graphene patches which present different
colorations when shined with white light. In particular yellow-, pink- and
blue- colored areas are evidenced. Combining optical microscopy, Raman
spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy we have been able to assign
these colorations to ranges of rotational angles between the two graphene
layers. Optical contrast simulations have been carried out, proving that the
observation of the different colorations is due to the angle-dependent
electronic properties of tBLG combined with the reflection that results from
the layered structure tBLG / 100 nm-thick SiO2 / Si. Our results could lead the
way to an easy selective identification of bi-layer graphene merely through the
observation on an optical microscope.

copulas by constructing a hierarchy of conditional bivariate copulas. However,
to simplify inference, it is common to assume that each of these conditional
bivariate copulas is independent from its conditioning variables. In this
paper, we relax this assumption by discovering the latent functions that
specify the shape of a conditional copula given its conditioning variables We
learn these functions by following a Bayesian approach based on sparse Gaussian

forecast how the game would be played if they formed coalitions and then they
play according to their best forecast. In this paper we formalize this idea and

exponent {\theta}', corresponds to motions of particles extending throughout
the entire system. Mode two, whose density is characterized by an exponent
{\theta} != {\theta}', corresponds to the local buckling of a few particles.
Mode one is shown to yield at a much higher rate than mode two when a stress is
applied. We show that the distribution of contact forces follows P(f)
f^{min({\theta}',{\theta})}, and that imposing that the packing cannot be
densified further leads to the bounds {\gamma} >= 1/(2+{\theta}') and {\gamma}
>= (1-{\theta})/2, where {\gamma} characterizes the singularity of the pair
distribution function g(r) at contact. These results extend the theoretical
analysis of [M. Wyart, Phys. Rev. Lett 109, 125502 (2012)] where the existence

marginal stability thus allows to make clearcut predictions on the ensemble of

For example, the majority of faint stars observed with Gaia will not have their
radial velocities measured. Aims. Our aim is to formulate and test a new
maximum likelihood approach to estimating the kinematical parameters for a
local stellar sample when only the transverse velocities are known (from
parallaxes and proper motions). Methods. Numerical simulations using
synthetically generated data as well as real data (based on the
Geneva-Copenhagen survey) are used to investigate the statistical properties
(bias, precision) of the method, and to compare its performance with the much
simpler ""projection method"" described by Dehnen & Binney (1998). Results. The
maximum likelihood method gives more correct estimates of the dispersion when
observational errors are important, and guarantees a positive-definite
dispersion matrix, which is not always obtained with the projection method.
Possible extensions and improvements of the method are discussed.

It allows one to encode the logical qubits without measurements and to protect

coupled cavity mode mediates a long-range attractive interaction between the
stabilizer operators of the toric code, thereby suppressing the creation of
thermal anyons. This significantly increases the lifetime of the memory

fast and easy-to-use software for high-throughput comparison of protein models

Conclusions: The application was highly optimized and written in C/C++,

self-propel but also to exert forces on obstacles (to push) and to carry
cargoes (to pull). To study the inherent asymmetry between active pushing and
pulling we model a crawling acto-myosin cell extract as a 1D layer of active
gel subjected to external forces. We show that pushing is controlled by
protrusion and that the macroscopic signature of the protrusion dominated
motility mechanism is concavity of the force velocity relation. Instead,
pulling is driven by protrusion only at small values of the pulling force and
it is replaced by contraction when the pulling force is sufficiently large.
This leads to more complex convex-concave structure of the force velocity
relation, in particular, competition between protrusion and contraction can
produce negative mobility in a biologically relevant range. The model
illustrates active readjustment of the force generating machinery in response
to changes in the dipole structure of external forces. The possibility of
switching between complementary active mechanisms implies that if necessary
'pushers' can replace 'pullers' and visa versa.

sets, potentially infinite sets of compounds that can be constructed by a
prescribed collection of reaction mechanisms, in practice suffer from a
combinatorial explosion. It quickly becomes impossible to test, for all pairs
of compounds in a rapidly growing network, whether they can react with each
other. More sophisticated and efficient strategies are therefore required to
construct very large chemical reaction networks.
  Undirected labeled graphs and graph rewriting are natural models of chemical
compounds and chemical reactions. Borrowing the idea of partial evaluation from
functional programming, we introduce partial applications of rewrite rules.
Binding substrate to rules increases the number of rules but drastically prunes
the substrate sets to which it might match, resulting in dramatically reduced
resource requirements. At the same time, exploration strategies can be guided,
e.g. based on restrictions on the product molecules to avoid the explicit
enumeration of very unlikely compounds. To this end we introduce here a generic
framework for the specification of exploration strategies in graph-rewriting
systems. Using key examples of complex chemical networks from sugar chemistry
and the realm of metabolic networks we demonstrate the feasibility of a
high-level strategy framework.
  The ideas presented here can not only be used for a strategy-based chemical
space exploration that has close correspondence of experimental results, but
are much more general. In particular, the framework can be used to emulate
higher-level transformation models such as illustrated in a small puzzle game.

prior to accessing an application, can effectively inform the OS whether the
access request is benign or malicious. Specifically, we present the design of
two mechanisms: (1) accelerometer based phone tapping detection; and (2)
proximity sensor based finger tapping, rubbing or hand waving detection. The
first mechanism is geared for NFC applications, which usually require the user
to tap her phone with another device. The second mechanism involves very simple
gestures, i.e., tapping or rubbing a finger near the top of phone's screen or
waving a hand close to the phone, and broadly appeals to many applications
(e.g., SMS). In addition, we present the TWR-enhanced Android permission model,

a variety of novel experiments to evaluate these mechanisms. Our results
suggest the proposed approach could be very effective for malware detection and

eccentric Be binary system delta Scorpii 2011 periastron passage which involved
professional and amateur astronomers. Our spectroscopic observations provided a
precise measurement of the system orbital period at 10.8092+/- 0.0005 years.
Fitting of the He II 4686A line radial velocity curve determined the periastron
passage time on 2011 July 3, UT 9:20 with a 0.9--day uncertainty. Both these
results are in a very good agreement with recent findings from interferometry.
We also derived new evolutionary masses of the binary components (13 and 8.2
Msun) and a new distance of 136 pc from the Sun, consistent with the HIPPARCOS
parallax. The radial velocity and profile variations observed in the H_alpha
line near the 2011 periastron reflected the interaction of the secondary
component and the circumstellar disk around the primary component. Using these
data, we estimated a disk radius of 150 Rsun. Our analysis of the radial
velocity variations measured during the periastron passage time in 2000 and
2011 along with those measured during the 20th century, the high eccentricity
of the system, and the presence of a bow shock-like structure around it suggest
that delta Sco might be a runaway triple system. The third component should be
external to the known binary and move on an elliptical orbit that is tilted by
at least 40 degree with respect to the binary orbital plane for such a system
to be stable and responsible for the observed long-term radial velocity
variations.

organize them into three categories, i.e., the chunk first scheme, the peer
first scheme and the epidemic scheme. Through numerical performance evaluation,
the impacts of some important parameters, such as size of neighbor set, reply

first scheme, we show that the pull-based schemes do not perform as well as the
push-based schemes when peers are limited to reply only one request in each

will reach close to optimal playout probability. As to the pull-based epidemic

sub-systems: a pure convection system and a diffusion system. At each time
step, a convection problem and a diffusion problem are solved successively. The
scheme has the following nice features: the convection subproblem is solved
explicitly and a multistep technique is introduced to essentially enlarge the
stability region so that the resulting scheme behaves like an unconditionally
stable scheme; the diffusion subproblem is always self-adjoint and coercive so
that it can be solved efficiently using many existing optimal preconditioned
iterative solvers. The scheme is then extended for Navier-Stokes equations,
where the nonlinear convection is resolved by a linear explicit multistep
scheme at the convection step, and only a generalized Stokes problem is needed
to solve at the diffusion step with the resulting stiffness matrix being
invariant in the time marching process. The new schemes are all free from
tuning some stabilization parameters for the convection-dominated diffusion
problems. Numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the stability,
convergence and performance of the single-step and multistep variants of the

for these cotunneling processes decreases exponentially in the number of sites

can exponentially enhance the coupling between the Majorana bound states, both

When the

of the averaged evolution of the constants of motion, i.e., the energy,
azimuthal angular momentum and the Carter constant. Although there is no
conserved current composed of the perturbation field corresponding to the
Carter constant, it has been shown that the averaged rate of change of the
Carter constant can be given by a simple formula, when there exists a
simultaneous turning point of the radial and polar oscillations. However, an
inspiralling orbit may cross a ""resonance"" point, where the frequencies of the
radial and polar orbital oscillations are in a rational ratio. At the resonance
point, one cannot find a simultaneous turning point in general. Hence, even for
the averaged rate of change of the Carter constant, a direct computation of the

excitations of liquid helium (ripplons) on the shape of magnetoconductivity
oscillations induced by resonance microwave (MW) excitation is theoretically
studied. The MW field provides a substantial filling of the first excited
surface subband which sparks off inter-subband electron scattering by ripplons.
This scattering is the origin of magneto-oscillations in the momentum
relaxation rate. The inelastic effect becomes important when the energy of a
ripplon involved compares with the collision broadening of Landau levels.
Usually, such a condition is realized only at sufficiently high magnetic
fields. On the contrary, the inelastic nature of inter-subband scattering is
shown to be more important in a lower magnetic field range because of the new
enhancement factor: the ratio of the inter-subband transition frequency to the
cyclotron frequency. This inelastic effect affects strongly the shape of
conductivity oscillations which acquires an additional wavy feature (a mixture
of splitting and inversion) in the vicinity of the level-matching points where
the above noted ratio is close to an integer.

continuously to the projective measurement, both super one-way deficit and
super-quantum discord converge to the same value, which is either the one-way
deficit or the quantum discord both quantifying quantum correlation. In this
sense, weak measurement does not necessarily capture more quantumness of
correlations. We also give the geometry of super- quantum discord of the
Bell-diagonal states with explicit geometrical figures. As an application, the
dynamic behavior of super- quantum correlation including super-quantum discord

researchers from academic institutions publish their works can be considered as
useful identifiers for representing the relationships between these

used for research output representation, distinctions must be introduced
between them, based on their value as institution descriptors. This leads us to
the use of journal weights attached to the institution identifiers. Since a
journal in which researchers from a large proportion of institutions published
their papers may be a bad indicator of similarity between two academic
institutions, it seems reasonable to weight it in accordance with how
frequently researchers from different institutions published their papers in
this journal. Cluster analysis can then be applied to group the academic
institutions, and dendrograms can be provided to illustrate groups of
institutions following agglomerative hierarchical clustering. In order to test
this methodology, we use a sample of Spanish universities as a case study. We
first map the study sample according to an institution's overall research
output, then we use it for two scientific fields (Information and Communication
Technologies, as well as Medicine and Pharmacology) as a means to demonstrate
how our methodology can be applied, not only for analyzing institutions as a
whole, but also in different disciplinary contexts.

networks generated randomly or obtained in practical measurements of some

assume access to truly random sources, which is often not reasonable in case of
wireless devices. In this work we use a formal framework to study the problem
of broadcasting and its time complexity in any two dimensional Euclidean
wireless network with uniform transmission powers. For the analysis, we
consider two popular models of ad hoc networks based on the
Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise Ratio (SINR): one with opportunistic links,
and the other with randomly disturbed SINR. In the former model, we show that
one of our algorithms accomplishes broadcasting in $O(D\log^2 n)$ rounds, where
$n$ is the number of nodes and $D$ is the diameter of the network. If nodes
know a priori the granularity $g$ of the network, i.e., the inverse of the
maximum transmission range over the minimum distance between any two stations,
a modification of this algorithm accomplishes broadcasting in $O(D\log g)$
rounds.
  Finally, we modify both algorithms to make them efficient in the latter model
with randomly disturbed SINR, with only logarithmic growth of performance.
  Ours are the first provably efficient and well-scalable, under the two
models, distributed deterministic solutions for the broadcast task.

Order-preserving matching is applicable to many scenarios such as stock price

has to do with representations of order relations of a numeric string. We
define prefix representation and nearest neighbor representation, which lead to
efficient algorithms for order-preserving matching. We present efficient

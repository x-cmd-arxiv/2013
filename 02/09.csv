selectors of the tuning parameter in non-concave penalized regression methods
under the assumption that the population variance is known or that a consistent
estimator is available. We relax this assumption to prove that AIC itself is
asymptotically efficient and we study its performance in finite samples. In
classical regression, it is known that AIC tends to select overly complex
models when the dimension of the maximum candidate model is large relative to
the sample size. Simulation studies suggest that AIC suffers from the same
shortcomings when used in penalized regression. We therefore propose the use of
the classical corrected AIC (AICc) as an alternative and prove that it
maintains the desired asymptotic properties. To broaden our results, we further
prove the efficiency of AIC for penalized likelihood methods in the context of
generalized linear models with no dispersion parameter. Similar results exist
in the literature but only for a restricted set of candidate models. By
employing results from the classical literature on maximum-likelihood
estimation in misspecified models, we are able to establish this result for a
general set of candidate models. We use simulations to assess the performance
of AIC and AICc, as well as that of other selectors, in finite samples for both
SCAD-penalized and Lasso regressions and a real data example is considered.

have a pronounced effect on the fluorescent lines appearing in their spectra
due to reprocessing of primary radiation by the accretion disk and the white
dwarf surface. We show that the most dramatic and easily observable consequence
of the anomalous C/O abundance, is the significant, by more than an order of
magnitude, attenuation of the Ka line of iron. It is caused by screening of the
presence of iron by oxygen - in the C/O dominated material the main interaction
process for a E ~ 7keV photon is absorption by oxygen rather than by iron,
contrary to the solar composition case. Ionization of oxygen at high mass
accretion rates adds a luminosity dependence to this behavior - the iron line
is significantly suppressed only at low luminosity, log(LX) less than 37-37.5,
and should recover its nominal strength at higher luminosity. The increase of
the EW of the Ka lines of carbon and oxygen, on the other hand, saturates at
rather moderate values. Screening by He is less important, due to its low
ionization threshold and because in the accretion disk it is mostly ionized.
Consequently, in the case of the He-rich donor, the iron line strength remains
close to its nominal value, determined by the iron abundance in the accretion
disk. This opens the possibility of constraining the nature of donor stars in
UCXBs by means of X-ray spectroscopy with moderate energy resolution.

Chandra or XMM-Newton, offers the possibility to detect both absorption and
emission lines and to study the nature of the matter surrounding the neutron
star in X-ray binaries and the phenomena that produce these lines. The aim of
this work is to discuss the different physical scenarios in order to explain
the meaning of the significant absorption feature present in the X-ray spectrum
of 4U 1538-52. Using the last available calibrations, we discard the
possibility that this feature is due to calibration, gain effects or be
produced by the X-ray background or a dust region. Giving the energy resolution
of the XMM-Newton telescope we could not establish if the line is formed in the
atmosphere of the neutron star or by the dispersion of the stellar wind of the
optical counterpart.

property of underactuated mechanical systems: if an unactuated cyclic variable
is under a viscous damping-like force and the system starts from rest, then the
cyclic variable will always move back to its initial condition as the actuated
variables come to stop. The regular momentum conservation phenomenon can be
viewed as the limit of the damping-induced self-recovery phenomenon in the
sense that the self-recovery phenomenon disappears as the damping goes to zero.
This paper generalizes the past result on damping-induced self-recovery for the
case of a single unactuated cyclic variable to the case of multiple unactuated
cyclic variables. We characterize a class of external forces that induce new
conserved quantities, which we call the damping-induced momenta. The
damping-induced momenta yield first-order asymptotically stable dynamics for
the unactuated cyclic variables under some conditions, thereby inducing the
self-recovery phenomenon. It is also shown that the viscous damping-like forces
impose bounds on the range of trajectories of the unactuated cyclic variables.
Two examples are presented to demonstrate the analytical discoveries: the
planar pendulum with gimbal actuators and the three-link planar manipulator on
a horizontal plane.

The single-year, single-frequency WMAP maps are used to estimate

sources respectively as variable at greater than 99% confidence level in these
four bands. The amplitudes of variation are comparable between bands, and are
not correlated with either the flux densities or the spectral indices of the
sources. The number counts of WMAP Ka-band sources are stable from year to year
despite the fluctuation caused by individual source variability. Most of our
sources show strong correlation in variability between bands. Almost all the
sources that show variability are blazars. We have attempted to fit two simple,
four-parameter models to the time-series of 32 sources showing correlated
variability at multiple frequencies - a long-term flaring model and a
rotating-jet model. We find that 19 sources (60%) can be fit with the simple
rotating-jet model, and ten of these also fit the simple long-term flaring
model. The remaining 13 sources (40%) show more complex variability behaviour
that is not consistent with either model. Extended radio galaxies in our sample
show no sign of variability, as expected, with the exception of Pictor A for
which we report evidence for a millimetre flare lasting between 2002 and 2010.

security proofs. It gives an upper bound on the entropy loss of a random
variable $X$ in case the adversary who having already learned some random
variables $Z_{1},\ldots,Z_{\ell}$ correlated with $X$, obtains some further
information $Z_{\ell+1}$ about $X$. Analogously to the information-theoretic
case, one might expect that also for the \emph{computational} variants of
entropy the loss depends only on the actual leakage, i.e. on $Z_{\ell+1}$.
Surprisingly, Krenn et al.\ have shown recently that for the most commonly used
definitions of computational entropy this holds only if the computational
quality of the entropy deteriorates exponentially in
$|(Z_{1},\ldots,Z_{\ell})|$. This means that the current standard definitions
of computational entropy do not allow to fully capture leakage that occurred
""in the past"", which severely limits the applicability of this notion.
  As a remedy for this problem we propose a slightly stronger definition of the
computational entropy, which we call the \emph{modulus computational entropy},
and use it as a technical tool that allows us to prove a desired chain rule
that depends only on the actual leakage and not on its history. Moreover, we
show that the modulus computational entropy unifies other,sometimes seemingly
unrelated, notions already studied in the literature in the context of
information leakage and chain rules. Our results indicate that the modulus
entropy is, up to now, the weakest restriction that guarantees that the chain
rule for the computational entropy works. As an example of application we
demonstrate a few interesting cases where our restricted definition is
fulfilled and the chain rule holds.

effect of thermal fluctuations on the resolved flow. Supported by the assumed
analogy between molecules and the eddies in a turbulent flows, the idea of an
eddy viscosity has been put forward in the pioneering work by Lord Kelvin and
Osborne Reynolds. In over hundred years of turbulence modeling, the numerical
schemes adopted to simulate turbulent flow - with the exception of the Lattice
Boltzmann methods - have never exploited this analogy in any other way. In this
work, a gas-kinetic scheme is modified to simulate turbulent flow; the
turbulent relaxation time is deduced from assumed turbulent quantities. The new
scheme does not adopt an eddy viscosity, yet it relies even more strongly on
the analogy between thermal and turbulent fluctuations, as turbulence dynamics
is mathematically modeled by the Boltzmann equation. In the gas-kinetic scheme,
a measure of the degree of rarefaction is introduced, as the ratio between
unresolved and resolved time scales of motion. At low rarefaction, the
turbulent gas-kinetic scheme deviates negligibly from a conventional
Navier-Stokes scheme. However, as the degree of rarefaction increases, the
kinetic effects become evident. This phenomenon is evident in the mathematical
description of the turbulent stress tensor and also in numerical experiments.
This study does not propose an innovative turbulence model or technique. It
addresses the fact that the traditional coupling numerical scheme and
turbulence modeling might improve the physical consistence of numerical
simulations.

thermal saxions provide extra radiation already prior to BBN and decays of
axinos with a cosmologically required TeV-scale mass can produce extra entropy.

eV-scale axinos and weak-scale gravitinos that decay into axions and axinos.
These decays lead to late extra radiation which can coexist with the early
contributions from saxion decays. Recent results of the Planck satellite probe
extra radiation at late times and thereby both scenarios. Further tests are the
searches for axions at ADMX and for supersymmetric particles at the LHC.

broad H-alpha line regions (FWHM>1000 km/s) likely associated with an AGN and
regions of diffuse star formation traced by narrow-line H-alpha emission
(FWHM<500 km/s) dominated by multiple Halpha-bright stellar clumps, each
contributing 1-30% of the total clump-integrated H-alpha emission. We find that
these SMGs host high star-formation rate surface densities, similar to local
extreme sources, such as circumnuclear starbursts and luminous infrared
galaxies. However, in contrast to these local environments, SMGs appear to be
undergoing such intense activity on significantly larger spatial scales as
revealed by extended H-alpha emission over 4-16 kpc. H-alpha kinematics show no
evidence of ordered global motion as would be found in a disk, but rather large
velocity offsets (~few x 100 km/s) between the distinct stellar clumps.
Together with the asymmetric distribution of the stellar clumps around the AGN
in these objects, it is unlikely that we are unveiling a clumpy disk structure

properties. We found that 40% of the clumps observed in Sp 1149 are older than
30 Myr and can be as old as 300 Myr. These are also the more massive (luminous)
clumps in the galaxy. Among the complexes in the local reference sample, the
star-forming knots in luminous blue compact galaxies could be considered
progenitor analogs of these long-lived clumps. The remaining 60% of clumps have
colors comparable to local cluster complexes, suggesting a similar young age.
We observe that the Sp 1149 clumps follow the M ~ R^2 relation similar to local
cluster complexes, suggesting similar formation mechanisms although they may
have different initial conditions (e.g. higher gas surface densities). We
suggest that the galaxy is experiencing a slow decline in star formation rate
and a likely transitional phase toward a more quiescent star-formation mode.
The older clumps have survived between 6 and 20 dynamical times and are all
located at projected distances smaller than 4 kpc from the centre. Their
current location suggests migration toward the centre and the possibility to be
the building blocks of the bulge. On the other hand, the dynamical timescale of
the younger clumps are significantly shorter, meaning that they are quite close
to their birthplace. We show that the clumps of Sp 1149 may account for the
expected metal-rich globular cluster population usually associated with the

shocks. Though very popular and robust, this conjecture still needs a
conclusive proof. The strongest support to this idea is probably the fact that
supernova remnants are observed in gamma-rays, which are indeed expected as the
result of the hadronic interactions between the cosmic rays accelerated at the
shock and the ambient gas. However, also leptonic processes can, in most cases,
explain the observed gamma-ray emission. This implies that the detections in
gamma rays do not necessarily mean that supernova remnants accelerate cosmic
ray protons. To overcome this degeneracy, the multi-wavelength emission (from
radio to gamma rays) from individual supernova remnants has been studied and in
a few cases it has been possible to ascribe the gamma-ray emission to one of
the two processes (hadronic or leptonic). Here we adopt a different approach
and, instead of a case-by-case study we aim for a population study and we
compute the number of supernova remnants which are expected to be seen in TeV
gamma rays above a given flux under the assumption that these objects indeed
are the sources of cosmic rays. The predictions found here match well with
current observational results, thus providing a novel consistency check for the
supernova remnant paradigm for the origin of galactic cosmic rays. Moreover,
hints are presented for the fact that particle spectra significantly steeper
than E^-2 are produced at supernova remnants. Finally, we expect that several
of the supernova remnants detected by H.E.S.S. in the survey of the galactic
plane should exhibit a gamma-ray emission dominated by hadronic processes (i.e.
neutral pion decay). The fraction of the detected remnants for which the
leptonic emission dominates over the hadronic one depends on the assumed values
of the physical parameters and can be as high as roughly a half.

relaxation times toward a state of energy equipartition, so that velocity
dispersion scales with stellar mass as \sigma ~ m^{-\eta} with \eta = 0.5. We
show that this is incorrect, using direct N-body simulations with a variety of
realistic IMFs and initial conditions. No simulated system ever reaches a state
close to equipartition. Near the center, the luminous main-sequence stars reach
a maximum \eta_{max} ~ 0.15 \pm 0.03. At large times, all radial bins
convergence on an asymptotic value \eta_{\infty} ~ 0.08 \pm 0.02. The
development of this ""partial equipartition"" is strikingly similar across our
simulations, despite the range of initial conditions employed. Compact remnants
tend to have higher \eta than main-sequence stars (but still \eta < 0.5), due
to their steeper (evolved) mass function. The presence of an intermediate-mass
black hole (IMBH) decreases \eta, consistent with our previous findings of a
quenching of mass segregation under these conditions. All these results can be
understood as a consequence of the Spitzer instability for two-component
systems, extended by Vishniac to a continuous mass spectrum. Mass segregation
(the tendency of heavier stars to sink toward the core) has often been studied
observationally, but energy equipartition has not. Due to the advent of
high-quality proper motion datasets from the Hubble Space Telescope, it is now
possible to measure \eta. Detailed data-model comparisons open up a new
observational window on globular cluster dynamics and evolution. Comparison of
our simulations to Omega Cen observations yields good agreement, confirming
that globular clusters are not generally in energy equipartition. Modeling
techniques that assume equipartition by construction (e.g., multi-mass
Michie-King models) are approximate at best.

Deeper understanding of the role of topology in physics has led to a new class
of matter: topologically - ordered systems. The best known examples are quantum
Hall effects, where insensitivity to local properties manifests itself as
conductance through edge states that is insensitive to defects and disorder.
Current research in engineering topological order primarily focuses on
analogies to quantum Hall systems, where the required magnetic field is
synthesized in non-magnetic systems. Here, we realize synthetic magnetic fields
for photons at room temperature, using linear Silicon photonics. We observe,
for the first time, topological edge states of light in a two - dimensional
system and show their robustness against intrinsic and introduced disorder. Our
experiment demonstrates the feasibility of using photonics to realize
topological order in both the non-interacting and many-body regimes.

used in recent years as fluorescent probes for near-field and cellular imaging.
In this work we report that an infrared (IR) pulsed excitation beam can quench
the photoluminescence of NV color center in a diamond nanocrystal (size < 50
nm) with an extinction ratio as high as ~90%. We attribute this effect to the
heating of the nanocrystal consecutive to multi-photon absorption by the
diamond matrix. This quenching is reversible: the photoluminescence intensity
goes back to its original value when the IR laser beam is turned off, with a
typical response time of hundred picoseconds, allowing for a fast control of NV
color center photoluminescence. We used this effect to achieve sub-diffraction
limited imaging of fluorescent diamond nanocrystals on a coverglass. For that,
as in Ground State Depletion super-resolution technique, we combined the green
excitation laser beam with the control IR depleting one after shaping its
intensity profile in a doughnut form, so that the emission comes only from the
sub-wavelength size central part.

materializes in atomically disordered systems as in amorphous alloys (1) or in
crystals riddled with defects(2). A manifestation of this conundrum is
envisaged in the highly defective iron chalcogenide superconductors of
KxFe2-ySe2 (3-6). How can superconductivity survive under such crude conditions
that call for strong electron localization (7)? With vacancies present both at
the K and Fe sites, superconductivity is bordering a semi-metallic region below
x ~ 0.7 and an insulating and antiferromagnetic region above x ~ 0.85 (8,9).
Here, we report on the bulk local atomic structure and show that the Fe
sublattice is locally distorted in a way that it accommodates two kinds of Fe
valence environments giving rise to a bimodal bond distribution. While the bond
length distribution is driven by K and Fe contents, the superconducting state
is characterized by the coexistence of both short (metallic) and long
(insulating) Fe bond environments and is not phase separated. In contrast to
other Fe-based materials in which only one kind of Fe to Fe bond is present,
the dual nature of the Fe correlations explains why superconductivity is
intertwined with magnetic order. Such a hybrid state is most likely present in
cuprate superconductors as well (10,11) while our results point to the
importance of the local atomic symmetry by which the exchange interactions
between local moments can materialize (12).

converge exponentially rapidly to the non-causal error, with the exponent being
the reciprocal of the non-causal error. We extend our results to mixtures of

optimization games where the player's choice is unconstrained. The player
strives to minimize regret, the difference between his loss and the loss of a
post-hoc benchmark strategy. The standard benchmark is the loss of the best
strategy chosen from a bounded comparator set. When the the comparison set and
the adversary's gradients satisfy L_infinity bounds, we give the value of the
game in closed form and prove it approaches sqrt(2T/pi) as T -> infinity.
  Interesting algorithms result when we consider soft constraints on the
comparator, rather than restricting it to a bounded set. As a warmup, we
analyze the game with a quadratic penalty. The value of this game is exactly
T/2, and this value is achieved by perhaps the simplest online algorithm of
all: unprojected gradient descent with a constant learning rate.
  We then derive a minimax-optimal algorithm for a much softer penalty
function. This algorithm achieves good bounds under the standard notion of
regret for any comparator point, without needing to specify the comparator set
in advance. The value of this game converges to sqrt{e} as T ->infinity; we
give a closed-form for the exact value as a function of T. The resulting
algorithm is natural in unconstrained investment or betting scenarios, since it
guarantees at worst constant loss, while allowing for exponential reward
against an ""easy"" adversary.

progress has been reported in recent years, including the faithful transfer of
quantum information from photons in pure and entangled qubit states. However,
none of these demonstrations confirm that photons stored in and recalled from
quantum memories remain suitable for two-photon interference measurements, such
as C-NOT gates and Bell-state measurements, which constitute another key
ingredient for all aforementioned applications of quantum information
processing. Using pairs of weak laser pulses, each containing less than one
photon on average, we demonstrate two-photon interference as well as a
Bell-state measurement after either none, one, or both pulses have been
reversibly mapped to separate thulium-doped titanium-indiffused lithium niobate

maximum, we conclude that our solid-state quantum memories, in addition to
faithfully mapping quantum information, also preserves the entire photonic
wavefunction. Hence, we demonstrate that our memories are generally suitable
for use in advanced applications of quantum information processing that require
two-photon interference.

environmental reflections limit the amount of passive suppression that can be
achieved, and (2) passive suppression, in general, increases the frequency
selectivity of the residual self-interference signal. These results suggest two
design implications: (1) deployments of full-duplex infrastructure nodes should
minimize near-antenna reflectors, and (2) active cancellation in concatenation
with passive suppression should employ higher-order filters or per-subcarrier
cancellation.

referred to as network MIMO with partial cooperation, since only a subset of

of this paper is on the optimization of linear beamforming strategies at the
BSs and at the users for network MIMO with partial cooperation. Individual
power constraints at the BSs are enforced, along with constraints on the number

problems of maximizing the sum-rate(SR) and minimizing the weighted sum mean
square error (WSMSE) of the data estimates are non-convex, and suboptimal
solutions with reasonable complexity need to be devised. Based on this,
suboptimal techniques that aim at maximizing the sum-rate for the MIMO-IFC-GC

necessary. Novel designs that aim at minimizing the WSMSE are then proposed.

forward-backward asymmetry (FBA), and has been excluded by the same-sign
top-pair productions at the LHC. However, the original $Z'$ model is not
physical, since the up-type quarks are massless including the top quark. This
disaster can be evaded if the Higgs sector is extended by including new Higgs
doublets with nonzero $U(1)'$ charges. We find that some parameter regions
could achieve not only the top FBA at the Tevatron, but also the charge
asymmetry at the LHC without exceeding the upper limit of the same-sign
top-quark pair production at the LHC. The lesson is that it is mandatory to
extend the Higgs sector whenever one considers chiral gauge symmetries beyond
the SM gauge group. Otherwise some fermions remain massless, and thus it is
meaningless to work on phenomenology without the extra Higgs doublets with new
chiral gauge charges.

observations are compared against a specific waveform model representative of a

Chern-Simons theory and Massive graviton theories. Model independent tests are
attempts to write down a parametrised gravitational waveform where the free
parameters take different values for different theories and (at least some of)
which can be constrained by GW observations. We revisit some of the proposed
bounds in the case of downscaled LISA configuration (eLISA) and compare them
with the original LISA configuration. We also compare the expected bounds on
alternative theories of gravity from ground-based and space-based detectors and
find that space-based GW detectors can test GR and other theories of gravity
with unprecedented accuracies. We then focus on a recent proposal to use
singular value decomposition (SVD) of the Fisher information matrix to improve
the accuracies with which Post-Newtonian (PN) theory can be tested. We extend

facilitate multiple research tasks. However, the current attempts to classify
Web service composition do not have clear objectives. Furthermore, the contexts
and technologies of composition approaches are confused in the existing

spatial dimensions in the context of nonlinear electrical lattices. Both
stationary and traveling self-localized modes were generated experimentally and
theoretically in a family of two-dimensional square, as well as hon- eycomb
lattices composed of 6x6 elements. Specifically, we find regions in driver
voltage and frequency where stationary discrete breathers, also known as
intrinsic localized modes (ILM), exist and are stable due to the interplay of
damping and spatially homogeneous driving. By introduc- ing additional
capacitors into the unit cell, these lattices can controllably induce traveling
discrete breathers. When more than one such ILMs are experimentally generated
in the lattice, the interplay of nonlinearity, discreteness and wave
interactions generate a complex dynamics wherein the ILMs attempt to maintain a
minimum distance between one another. Numerical simulations show good agreement
with experimental results, and confirm that these phenomena qualitatively carry
over to larger lattice sizes.

recovers in a finite time and eventually exhibits. Speculation consists in
guaranteeing that the system satisfies its requirements for any execution but
exhibits significantly better performances for a subset of executions that are
more probable. A speculative protocol is in this sense supposed to be both
robust and efficient in practice. We introduce the notion of speculative
stabilization which we illustrate through the mutual exclusion problem. We then
present a novel speculatively stabilizing mutual exclusion protocol. Our
protocol is self-stabilizing for any asynchronous execution. We prove that its
stabilization time for synchronous executions is diam(g)/2 steps (where diam(g)
denotes the diameter of the system). This complexity result is of independent
interest. The celebrated mutual exclusion protocol of Dijkstra stabilizes in n
steps (where n is the number of processes) in synchronous executions and the
question whether the stabilization time could be strictly smaller than the
diameter has been open since then (almost 40 years). We show that this is
indeed possible for any underlying topology. We also provide a lower bound
proof that shows that our new stabilization time of diam(g)/2 steps is optimal
for synchronous executions, even if asynchronous stabilization is not required.

The superconducting transition temperature Tc can be understood in terms of the

consists in a derivation of a reference model associated to an elementary
nominal model, and in a set of transformations to apply to this proof until it
takes into account the wanted features. In addition to the reference model
proof, the framework includes first order rewriting principles designed for
asymptotic model derivations, and second order rewriting principles dedicated

with relativistic effects taken into account and compared with those in the
non-relativistic approach. The treatment is based on the relativistic
drift-kinetic equation with the thermodynamic equilibrium given by the
relativistic Maxwell-J\""uttner distribution function. It is found that for the
range of fusion temperatures, T_e<100 keV, the relativistic effects produce a
reduction of the radial fluxes which does not exceed 10%. This rather small
effect is a consequence of the non-monotonic temperature dependence of the
relativistic correction caused by two counteracting factors: a reduction of the
contribution from the bulk and a significant broadening with the temperature
growth of the energy range of electrons contributing to transport.
  The relativistic formulation for the radial fluxes given in this paper is
expressed in terms of a set of relativistic thermodynamic forces which is not
identical to the canonical set since it contains an additional relativistic
correction term dependent on the temperature. At the same time, this
formulation allows application of the non-relativistic solvers currently used
for calculation of mono-energetic transport coefficients.

specific cases turns out to be familiar subspaces of $\beta X$. The known
topological structure of $Y$ enables us to establish several commutative
Gelfand--Naimark type theorems and derive results not generally expected to be
deducible from the standard Gelfand theory.

outflow of molecular gas in the radio-loud Seyfert galaxy IC5063 (z = 0.0110).
In addition to the emission of the large-scale CO disk, a prominent blueshifted
wing is observed in the CO(2-1) spectrum. IC5063 represents one of the best
cases of a fast jet-driven HI (and ionized gas) outflow, which is located at
the site of a radio-bright feature about 0.5 kpc from the nucleus. It is
possible that the blueshifted part of the molecular gas is associated with this
outflow and is accelerated by the interaction with the radio jet. The outflow
of molecular gas is characterized by an H$_2$ mass of the outflowing component
of between 2.25 +/- 0.70 x 10^7 M_sun and 1.29 +/- 0.40 x 10^8 M_sun and a mass
outflow rate between 22 and 129 M_sun/yr depending on the assumption for
alpha_X and assuming a luminosity ratio L'_CO(2-1)/L'_CO(1-0) = 1. This
confirms that this may indeed be the dominant component in outflows driven by
the nuclear activity that are also found in other objects. However, this high
mass outflow rate cannot easily be supported for a long time, suggesting that
the gas outflow in IC5063 happens in bursts and is in a particularly strong
phase at present. Owing to its proximity, IC5063 serves as an excellent
laboratory for understanding the impact of radio jets on the gas-rich
inter-stellar medium.

microscope (STM) has been used to study the properties of localized surface
plasmons (SPO) in so-called hot spots on a gold surface, where the local
electromagnetic field is extremely high. A CW semiconductor laser and a
femtosecond Ti:Sa laser were used to excite the plasmons and the SPO excited
tunnel current was used as the detector. When scanning the STM from negative to
positive bias and reversed, hysteresis in the tunnel signal was found,
excluding (or rather minimizing) the role of the presence of a Casimir effect
in the process. It was found, however, that a multiple image charge induced
double well potential may explain our experimental findings. The stepwise
behaviour of the area of the observed hysteresis loops is a new, additional
indication of the non-classical properties of the SPOs.

studies show that metal-poor massive stars can collapse into massive stellar
black holes (MSBHs), that is black holes with mass > 25 Msun. Such MSBHs are
sufficiently massive to explain most ULXs without requiring substantial
violations of the Eddington limit. The recent finding of an anti-correlation
between metallicity of the environment and number of ULXs per galaxy supports
this hypothesis. We present the results of recent N-body simulations, including
metallicity dependent stellar evolution, and we discuss the main pathways to
produce X-ray binaries powered by MSBHs.

of the strongest intermediate-mass black hole candidates. We discuss the
hypothesis that ESO 243-49 is undergoing a minor merger with a gas-rich disc
galaxy. We propose that the counterpart of HLX-1 coincides with the nucleus of
the secondary galaxy. We re-analyze the available photometric HST data, and we
compare them with the results of N-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics
simulations. In particular, we derive synthetic surface brightness profiles for
the simulated counterpart of HLX-1 in six HST filters, ranging from far
ultraviolet (FUV) to infrared wavelengths. Such synthetic profiles include a
contribution from the stellar population associated with the simulated
disrupted satellite and a contribution from an irradiated disc model. These are
in agreement with the observed surface brightness profiles of the HLX-1
counterpart, provided that the merger is at sufficiently late stage (>~2.5 Gyr
since the first pericentre passage). The main difference between models and
observations is in the FUV band, where the HST image shows a fuzzy and extended
emission.

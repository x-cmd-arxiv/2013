relaxing the topological restrictions assumed in [KKS] and by allowing a
weighted mean curvature functional. We also prove a partial converse (Theorem
4.1) which roughly says that when flux is conserved along a Killing field, a
hypersurface splits into two regions: one with constant (weighted) mean
curvature, and one preserved by the Killing field. We demonstrate our theory by
using it to derive a first integral for helicoidal surfaces of constant mean
curvature in Euclidean 3-space, i.e., ""twizzlers.""

originating from diverse sources poses novel computational challenges for
process reconstruction. We introduce an exact Bayesian inference framework that
properly accounts for the population heterogeneity but also retains scalability
with respect to the number of pooled cells. The key ingredient is a stochastic
process that captures the heterogeneous kinetics of a population. The method
allows to infer inaccessible molecular states, kinetic parameters, compute
Bayes factors and to dissect intrinsic, extrinsic and technical contributions
to the variability in the data. We also show how additional single-cell
readouts such as morphological features can be included into the analysis. We
then reconstruct the expression dynamics of a gene under an inducible GAL1
promoter in yeast from time-lapse microscopy data. Based on Bayesian model
selection the data yields no evidence of a refractory period for this promoter.

  Using A Bag-Of-Features Descriptor","Submitted to Medical Image Analysis",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The limitations of conventional imaging techniques have hitherto precluded a
thorough and formal investigation of the complex morphology of the left
ventricular (LV) endocardial surface and its relation to the severity of
Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). Recent developments in high-resolution
Multirow-Detector Computed Tomography (MDCT) scanner technology have enabled
the imaging of LV endocardial surface morphology in a single heart beat.
Analysis of high-resolution Computed Tomography (CT) images from a 320-MDCT
scanner allows the study of the relationship between percent Diameter Stenosis
(DS) of the major coronary arteries and localization of the cardiac segments
affected by coronary arterial stenosis. In this paper a novel approach for the
analysis using a combination of rigid transformation-invariant shape
descriptors and a more generalized isometry-invariant Bag-of-Features (BoF)
descriptor, is proposed and implemented. The proposed approach is shown to be
successful in identifying, localizing and quantifying the incidence and extent
of CAD and thus, is seen to have a potentially significant clinical impact.
Specifically, the association between the incidence and extent of CAD,
determined via the percent DS measurements of the major coronary arteries, and
the alterations in the endocardial surface morphology is formally quantified. A
multivariate regression test performed on a strict leave-one-out basis are
shown to exhibit a distinct pattern in terms of the correlation coefficient
within the cardiac segments where the incidence of coronary arterial stenosis
is localized.

strong ionospheric depletion and associated current broadening (a nonlinear
steepening/wavebreaking process) form magnetosphere-ionosphere waves inside a
downward current region and these oscillations drive upgoing inertial Alfv\'en
waves in the overlying plasma. The resulting waves are governed by
characteristic periods, which are a good match to previously observed periods
for reasonable assumed conditions. Meanwhile, wavelengths perpendicular to the
magnetic field initially map to an ionospheric scale comparable to the electron
inertial length for the low-altitude magnetosphere, but become shorter with
time due to frequency-based phase mixing of boundary waves (a new manifestation
of phase mixing). Under suitable conditions, these could act as seeds for the
ionospheric feedback instability.

that interpolation inequalities are independent of the dimension of the source

in intermediate-mass stars depends on the MS overshooting, hence it can be used
to set constraints on extra mixing during MS when coupled with chemical

  Helix and Slant Helix","17 pages. Final version!",,,,"math.DG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In classical curve theory, the geometry of a curve in three dimensions is
essentially characterized by their invariants, curvature and torsion. When they
are given, the problem of finding a corresponding curve is known as 'solving
natural equations'. Explicit solutions are known only for a handful of curve
classes, including notably the plane curves and general helices.
  This paper shows constructively how to solve the natural equations explicitly
for an infinite series of curve classes. For every Frenet curve, a family of
successor curves can be constructed which have the tangent of the original
curve as principal normal. Helices are exactly the successor curves of plane
curves and applying the successor transformation to helices leads to slant
helices, a class of curves that has received considerable attention in recent
years as a natural extension of the concept of general helices.
  The present paper gives for the first time a generic characterization of the
slant helix in three-dimensional Euclidian space in terms of its curvature and
torsion, and derives an explicit arc-length parametrization of its tangent
vector. These results expand on and put into perspective earlier work on
Salkowski curves and curves of constant precession, both of which are
subclasses of the slant helix.
  The paper also, for the benefit of novices and teachers, provides a novel and
generalized presentation of the theory of Frenet curves, which is not
restricted to curves with positive curvature. Bishop frames are examined along
with Frenet frames and Darboux frames as a useful tool in the theory of space
curves. The closed curve problem receives attention as well.

one-fifth of that determined by the Hipparcos mission. Employing modern
theoretical isochrones, which include effects of helium diffusion, revised

the uncertainty in the parallax, and is for adopted surface oxygen and iron

temperatures. For this, we employ the conventional current-voltage method as
well as the technique of Ballistic Electron Emission Microscopy (BEEM), which
can probe lateral inhomogeneities in transport at the nanometer scale. From
current-voltage measurements, we find that the Schottky Barrier height (SBH) at
the LSMO/Nb:STO interface decreases at low temperatures accompanied by a larger
than unity ideality factor. This is ascribed to the tunneling dominated
transport caused by the narrowing of the depletion width at the interface.
However, BEEM studies of such unbiased interfaces, do not exhibit SBH lowering
at low temperatures, implying that this is triggered by the modification of the
interface due to an applied bias and is not an intrinsic property of the
interface. Interestingly, the SBH at the nanoscale, as extracted from BEEM
studies, at different locations in the device is found to be spatially
homogeneous and similar both at room temperature and at low temperatures. Our
results highlight the application of BEEM in characterizing electron transport
and their homogeneity at such unbiased complex oxide interfaces and yields new
insights into the origin of the temperature dependence of the SBH at biased
interfaces.

group in highly uncertain environments and with limited, noisy information.
Recent work demonstrated that individual starlings within large flocks respond
to a fixed number of nearest neighbors, but until now it was not understood why
this number is seven. We analyze robustness to uncertainty of consensus in
empirical data from multiple starling flocks and show that the flock
interaction networks with six or seven neighbors optimize the trade-off between
group cohesion and individual effort. We can distinguish these numbers of
neighbors from fewer or greater numbers using our systems-theoretic approach to
measuring robustness of interaction networks as a function of the network
structure, i.e., who is sensing whom. The metric quantifies the disagreement
within the network due to disturbances and noise during consensus behavior and
can be evaluated over a parameterized family of hypothesized sensing strategies
(here the parameter is number of neighbors). We use this approach to further
show that for the range of flocks studied the optimal number of neighbors does
not depend on the number of birds within a flock; rather, it depends on the
shape, notably the thickness, of the flock. The results suggest that robustness
to uncertainty may have been a factor in the evolution of flocking for
starlings. More generally, our results elucidate the role of the interaction
network on uncertainty management in collective behavior, and motivate the
application of our approach to other biological networks.

must solve from the subcellular to the organismal scales, but it is not well
understood what physical principles and mechanisms organisms use to sense and
regulate their size. Any biophysical size-regulation scheme operates in a noisy
environment and must be robust to other cellular dynamics and fluctuations.
This work develops theory of filament length regulation inspired by recent
experiments on kinesin-8 motor proteins, which move with directional bias on
microtubule filaments and alter microtubule dynamics. Purified kinesin-8 motors
can depolymerize chemically-stabilized microtubules. In the length-dependent
depolymerization model, the rate of depolymerization tends to increase with
filament length, because long filaments accumulate more motors at their tips
and therefore shorten more quickly. When balanced with a constant filament
growth rate, this mechanism can lead to a fixed polymer length. However, the
mechanism by which kinesin-8 motors affect the length of dynamic microtubules
in cells is less clear. We study the more biologically realistic problem of
microtubule dynamic instability modulated by a motor-dependent increase in the
filament catastrophe frequency. This leads to a significant decrease in the
mean filament length and a narrowing of the filament length distribution. The
results improve our understanding of the biophysics of length regulation in
cells.

the outcome of a statistical mixture of simple local forms, we test and compare
different probability density functions to provide the long-term distribution

pulse by a strong pump pulse must account for coherent effects that only occur
when the pump and probe pulses are temporally overlapped. It is well known that
a weak probe beam experiences a greater phase shift from a strong pump beam
than the pump beam induces on itself. The physical mechanism behind the
enhanced phase shift is diffraction of pump light into the probe direction by a
nonlinear refractive index grating produced by interference between the two
beams. For an instantaneous third-order response, the effect of the grating is
to simply double the probe phase shift, but when delayed nonlinearities are
considered, the effect is more complex. A comprehensive treatment is given for
both degenerate and nondegenerate pump-probe experiments in noble and diatomic
gases. Results of numerical calculations are compared to a recent transient

observed phenomena in nature, especially the interaction of jets of various

described by the well-known Buneman relation. In 2011, Bohata, Bren, and
Kulhanek derived the relation for the two-stream instability without the cold
limit, with the general orientation of magnetic field, and arbitrary stream

dispersion branches is of interest from the physical point of view. It
represents the instability growth rate which is responsible for the turbulence
mode onset and subsequent reconnection on the ion radius scale accompanied by a
strong plasma thermalization. The paper presented here is focused on the
non-relativistic instability growth rate and its dependence on various input
parameters, such as magnitude and direction of magnetic field, sound velocity,
plasma frequency of the jet and direction of the wave vector during the jet -
background interaction. The results are presented in well-arranged plots and
can be used for determination of the plasma parameter values close to which the

4.6e9 M_Sun and a stellar population age of 0.7 Gyr, and GRB 101219A originated
in a star-forming galaxy at z=0.718 with a stellar mass of 1.4e9 M_Sun, a star
formation rate of 16 M_Sun yr^-1, and a stellar population age of 50 Myr. We
also report the discovery of the optical afterglow of GRB 110112A, which lacks
a coincident host galaxy to i>26 mag and we cannot conclusively identify any
field galaxy as a possible host. The bursts have inferred circumburst densities
of ~1e-4-1 cm^-3, and isotropic-equivalent gamma-ray and kinetic energies of
1e50-1e51 erg. These events highlight the diversity of galaxies that host short
GRBs. To quantify this diversity, we use the sample of 36 Swift short GRBs with
robust associations to an environment (~1/2 of 68 short bursts detected by
Swift to May 2012) and classify them as follows: late-type (50%), early-type
(15%), inconclusive (20%), and host-less (lacking a coincident host galaxy to
limits of >26 mag; 15%). To find likely ranges for the true late- and
early-type fractions, we assign each of the host-less bursts to the late- or
early-type category using probabilistic arguments, and consider the scenario
that all hosts in the inconclusive category are early-type galaxies to set an
upper bound on the early-type fraction. The most likely ranges for the late-
and early-type fractions are ~60-80% and ~20-40%, respectively. We find no
clear trend between gamma-ray duration and host type, and no change to the
fractions when excluding events recently claimed as possible contaminants from
the long GRB/collapsar population. Our reported demographics are consistent
with a short GRB rate driven by both stellar mass and star formation.

six-dimensional theories describes four-dimensional flat space times a compact
two-dimensional internal space with additional localized sources. This induces
a spontaneous compactification to four space-time dimensions and breaks the
supersymmetry from N=2 to N=1, which allows the reduced theory to have a

few months only, so the knot needs to be reheated continuously. The shock speed
derived from models of H alpha and forbidden emission lines (FELs) decreased

disks threaded by net vertical magnetic fields which drive
magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) turbulence through the magnetorotational instabilty
(MRI), using three dimensional simulations in the unstratified local shearing
box approximation. The wakes, which are excited by the planets, are damped by
shocks similar to the wake damping in inviscid hydrodynamic (HD) disks. Angular
momentum deposition by shock damping opens gaps in both MHD turbulent disks and
inviscid HD disks even for low mass planets, in contradiction to the ""thermal
criterion"" for gap opening. To test the ""viscous criterion"", we compared gap
properties in MRI-turbulent disks to those in viscous HD disks having the same
stress, and found that the same mass planet opens a significantly deeper and
wider gap in net vertical flux MHD disks than in viscous HD disks. This
difference arises due to the efficient magnetic field transport into the gap
region in MRI disks, leading to a larger effective \alpha within the gap. Thus,
across the gap, the Maxwell stress profile is smoother than the gap density
profile, and a deeper gap is needed for the Maxwell stress gradient to balance
the planetary torque density. We also confirmed the large excess torque close
to the planet in MHD disks, and found that long-lived density features (termed
zonal flows) produced by the MRI can affect planet migration. The comparison
with previous results from net toroidal flux/zero flux MHD simulations
indicates that the magnetic field geometry plays an important role in the gap
opening process. Overall, our results suggest that gaps can be commonly
produced by low mass planets in realistic protoplanetary disks, and caution the
use of a constant \alpha-viscosity to model gaps in protoplanetary disks.

large number of subhalos for each galaxy-size halo. It is well known that
matching the subhalos to the observed properties of luminous satellites of
galaxies in the local universe poses a significant challenge to our
understanding of the astrophysics of galaxy formation. We show that the cosmic
evolution and host mass dependence of the luminosity function of satellites
provides a powerful new diagnostic to disentangle astrophysical effects from
variations in the underlying dark matter mass function. We illustrate this by
comparing the results of recent observations of satellites out to $z=0.8$ based
on Hubble Space Telescope images with the predictions of three different sets
of state-of-the art semi-analytic models with underlying CDM power spectra and
one semi-analytic model with an underlying Warm Dark Matter (WDM) power
spectrum. We find that even though CDM models provide a reasonable fit to the
local luminosity function of satellites around galaxies comparable or slightly
larger than the Milky Way, they do not reproduce the data as well for different
redshift and host galaxy stellar mass. This tension indicates that further
improvements are likely to be needed in the description of star formation if
the models are to be reconciled with the data. The WDM model matches the
observed mass dependence and redshift evolution of satellite galaxies more
closely than any of the CDM models, indicating that a modification of the
underlying power spectrum may offer an alternative solution to this tension. We
conclude by presenting predictions for the color magnitude relation of
satellite galaxies to demonstrate how future observations will be able to
further distinguish between these models and help constrain baryonic and
non-baryonic physics.

  Markov Chain Approach",,,,,"cs.NI cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently several CSMA algorithms based on the Glauber dynamics model have
been proposed for multihop wireless scheduling, as viable solutions to achieve
the throughput optimality, yet are simple to implement. However, their delay
performances still remain unsatisfactory, mainly due to the nature of the
underlying Markov chains that imposes a fundamental constraint on how the link
state can evolve over time. In this paper, we propose a new approach toward
better queueing and delay performance, based on our observation that the
algorithm needs not be Markovian, as long as it can be implemented in a
distributed manner, achieve the same throughput optimality, while offering far
better delay performance for general network topologies. Our approach hinges
upon utilizing past state information observed by local link and then
constructing a high-order Markov chain for the evolution of the feasible link
schedules. We show in theory and simulation that our proposed algorithm, named
delayed CSMA, adds virtually no additional overhead onto the existing
CSMA-based algorithms, achieves the throughput optimality under the usual
choice of link weight as a function of local queue length, and also provides
much better delay performance by effectively `de-correlating' the link state
process (thus removing link starvation) under any arbitrary network topology.
From our extensive simulations we observe that the delay under our algorithm
can be often reduced by a factor of 20 over a wide range of scenarios, compared
to the standard Glauber-dynamics-based CSMA algorithm.

high-dispersion spectroscopy to separate the extraterrestrial and telluric

of oxygen from an Earth-twin orbiting a small red dwarf star is only a factor 3
smaller than that of carbon monoxide recently detected in the hot Jupiter tau

single temperature scale Tc separating the normal from the superconducting

scales. One is the pseudogap scale T*, below which electronic excitations
exhibit an energy gap. The second is the coherence scale Tcoh, below which
sharp spectral features appear due to increased lifetime of the excitations. We
find that T* and Tcoh are strongly doping dependent and cross each other near

received a lot of attention, a mathematical definition of the resilience of an

methodology for the assessment of urban resilience to catastrophic events which
aims at bridging the gap between the engineering and the ecosystem approaches

social-physical complex networks, obtained by enriching the urban street
network with additional information about the social and physical constituents
of a city, namely citizens, residential buildings and services. Then, we
introduce a class of efficiency measures on these hybrid networks, inspired by
the definition of global efficiency given in complex network theory, and we
show that these measures can be effectively used to quantify the resilience of
a urban system, by comparing their respective values before and after a
catastrophic event and during the reconstruction process. As a case study, we
consider simulated earthquakes in the city of Acerra, Italy, and we use these
efficiency measures to compare the ability of different reconstruction
strategies in restoring the original performance of the urban system.

the atom/ion. The consequence of the process is the polarization of spectral
lines resulting from scattering and absorption from aligned atomic/ionic
species with fine or hyperfine structure. The magnetic field induces precession
and realign the atom/ion and therefore the polarization of the emitted or
absorbed radiation reflects the direction of the magnetic field. The atoms get
aligned at their low levels and, as the life-time of the atoms/ions we deal
with is long, the alignment induced by anisotropic radiation is susceptible to
extremely weak magnetic fields ($1{\rm G}\gtrsim B\gtrsim 10^{-15}$G). In fact,
the effects of atomic/ionic alignment were studied in the laboratory decades
ago, mostly in relation to the maser research. Recently, the atomic effect has
been already detected in observations from circumstellar medium and this is a
harbinger of future extensive magnetic field studies. A unique feature of the
atomic realignment is that they can reveal the 3D orientation of magnetic
field. In this article, we shall review the basic physical processes involved
in atomic realignment. We shall also discuss its applications to
interplanetary, circumstellar and interstellar magnetic fields. In addition,
our research reveals that the polarization of the radiation arising from the
transitions between fine and hyperfine states of the ground level can provide a
unique diagnostics of magnetic fields in the Epoch of Reionization.

of pterosaurs and saurischian dinosaurs are diagnostic for pneumaticity. In
basal saurischians only the cervical skeleton is pneumatized, by cervical air
sacs. In more derived saurischians pneumatization of posterior dorsal, sacral,
and caudal vertebrae indicates abdominal air sacs. Abdominal air sacs in
sauropods are also indicated by a pneumatic hiatus (a gap in vertebral
pneumatization) in Haplocanthosaurus. Minimally, saurischians had dorsally
attached diverticular lungs plus anterior and posterior air sacs, and all the
pulmonary prerequisites for flow-through lung ventilation like that of birds.
Pneumaticity reduced skeletal mass in saurischians. I propose the Air Space
Proportion (ASP) as a measure of proportional volume of air in pneumatic bones.
The mean ASP of a sample of sauropod and theropod vertebrae is 0.61, so on
average, air occupied more than half the volume of these vertebrae. In
Diplodocus, pneumatization lightened the living animal by 7-10 percent, and
that does not include extraskeletal diverticula, air sacs, lungs, or trachea.
If all these air reservoirs included, the specific gravity of Diplodocus is
0.80, higher than published values for birds but lower than those for squamates
and crocodilians. Pneumatization of cervical vertebrae facilitated evolution of
long necks in sauropods. Necks longer than nine meters evolved at least four
times, in mamenchisaurs, diplodocids, brachiosaurids, and titanosaurs.
Increases in the number of cervical vertebrae, their proportional lengths, and

distribution of the hydrogen atoms existed in the Saturnian magnetosphere.
Recent Cassini observations confirmed the local-time asymmetry but also showed
the hydrogen cloud density increases with decreasing distance to Saturn. The
origin of the atomic hydrogen cloud has been debated ever since. Therefore, we
have carried out a global investigation of the atomic hydrogen cloud taking
into account all possible sources: 1) the Saturnian atmosphere, 2) the H2
atmosphere of main rings, 3) Enceladus H2O and OH torus, 4) Titan H2 torus and
5) the atomic hydrogen directly escaping from Titan. We show that the H
ejection velocity and angle distribution are modified by collisions of the hot
H, produced by electron-impact dissociation of H2, with the ambient atmospheric
H2 and H. This in turn affects the morphology of the escaping hydrogen as does
the morphology of the ionospheric electron distribution. That Saturn atmosphere
is an important source is suggested by the fact that the H cloud peaks well
below the ring plane, a feature that, so far, we can not reproduce by the
dissociation of the ring H2 atmosphere or other proposed sources. Our
simulations show that H directly escaping from Titan is a major contribution in
the outer magnetosphere. The morphology of Titan H torus, shaped by the solar
radiation pressure and the Saturnian oblateness, can account for the local time
asymmetry near Titan orbit. Dissociation of H2O and OH in the Enceladus torus
contributes inside ~5 RS, but dissociation of Titan H2 torus does not due to
the significant energy released. The total number of H observed by Cassini
inside 5 RS: our modeling results suggest ~20% from dissociation in the
Enceladus torus, ~10% from dissociation of ring H2 atmosphere, and ~50% from
Titan H torus implying that ~20% comes from the Saturnian atmosphere.

correlated Gaussian processes, in which the covariance structure is a
decreasing function of both geographic and ecological distance. Parameters of
the model are estimated using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We call
this method Bayesian Estimation of Differentiation in Alleles by Spatial

nonlinear structured learning by combining a set of weak structured learners.
As SSVM generalizes SVM, our StructBoost generalizes standard boosting

optimization problem of StructBoost is more challenging than SSVM in the sense
that it may involve exponentially many variables and constraints. In contrast,
for SSVM one usually has an exponential number of constraints and a
cutting-plane method is used. In order to efficiently solve StructBoost, we
formulate an equivalent $ 1 $-slack formulation and solve it using a
combination of cutting planes and column generation. We show the versatility

solar chromosphere. The numerical model includes collisional transport,
interaction and reactions between the species, and optically thin radiative
losses. This model improves upon our previous work in Leake et al. 2012
\cite{Leake2012} by considering realistic chromospheric transport coefficients,
and by solving a generalized Ohm's law that accounts for finite ion-inertia and
electron-neutral drag.
  We find that during the two dimensional reconnection of a Harris current
sheet with an initial width larger than the neutral-ion collisional coupling
scale, the current sheet thins until its width becomes less than this coupling
scale, and the neutral and ion fluids decouple upstream from the reconnection
site. During this process of decoupling, we observe reconnection faster than
the single-fluid Sweet-Parker prediction, with recombination and plasma outflow
both playing a role in determining the reconnection rate.
  As the current sheet thins further and elongates it becomes unstable to the
secondary tearing instability, and plasmoids are seen. The reconnection rate,
outflows and plasmoids observed in this simulation provide evidence that
magnetic reconnection in the chromosphere could be responsible for jet-like
transient phenomena such as spicules and chromospheric jets.

escapes from this galaxy. However, another recent spectroscopic survey revealed
that the supposed Lyman continuum emission could arise from a foreground galaxy
at z = 1.76 if the emission line newly detected from the galaxy at lambda_obs ~
3360 A is Lya. If this is the case, as the angular separation between these two
galaxies is very small (~ 0.6""), LAE 221724+001716 at z = 3.10 could be
amplified by the gravitational lensing caused by this intervening galaxy. Here
we present a possible gravitational lens model for the system of LAE
221724+001716. First, we estimate the stellar mass of the intervening galaxy as
Mstar ~ 3.5x10^9 Msun from its UV luminosity and ~ 3.0x10^7--2.4x10^9 Msun
through the SED fitting. Then, we find that the gravitational magnification
factor ranges from 1.01 to 1.16 using the so-called singular isothermal sphere
model for strong lensing. While LAE 221724+001716 is the first system of an
LAE-LAE lensing reported so far, the estimated magnification factor is not so
significant because the stellar mass of the intervening galaxy is small.

only fluctuations which distort the path lead to geometric dephasing. In a

agent wishes to be matched to an agent in the other set and has a strict
preference over these potential matches. A matching is stable if there are no
blocking pairs, i.e., no pair of agents that prefer each other to their
assigned matches. In this paper we study a variant of stable matching motivated
by the fact that, in most centralized markets, many agents do not have direct
communication with each other. Hence even if some blocking pairs exist, the
agents involved in those pairs may not be able to coordinate a deviation. We
model communication channels with a bipartite graph between the two sets of
agents which we call the social graph, and we study socially stable matchings.
A matching is socially stable if there are no blocking pairs that are connected
by an edge in the social graph. Socially stable matchings vary in size and so
we look for a maximum socially stable matching. We prove that this problem is
NP-hard and, assuming the unique games conjecture, hard to approximate within a
factor of 3/2-{\epsilon}, for any constant {\epsilon}>0. We complement the
hardness results with a 3/2-approximation algorithm.

region upstream of the Martian bow shock, detected by the magnetometer and
electron reflectometer (MAG / ER) onboard the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS)
spacecraft during the period known as Science Phasing Orbits (SPO). The
frequency of these waves, measured in the MGS reference frame (SC), is close to
the local proton cyclotron frequency. Minimum variance analysis (MVA) shows
that these 'proton cyclotron frequency' waves (PCWs) are characterized - in the
SC frame - by a left-hand, elliptical polarization and propagate almost
parallel to the background magnetic field. They also have a small degree of
compressibility and an amplitude that decreases with the increase of the
interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) cone angle and radial distance from the
planet. The latter result supports the idea that the source of these waves is
Mars. In addition, we find that these waves are not associated with the
foreshock . Empirical evidence and theoretical approaches suggest that most of
these observations correspond to the ion-ion right hand (RH) mode originating
from the pick-up of ionized exospheric hydrogen. The left-hand (LH) mode might
be present in cases where the IMF cone angle is high. PCWs occur in 62% of the
time during SPO1 subphase, whereas occurrence drops to 8% during SPO2. Also,
SPO1 PCWs preserve their characteristics for longer time periods and have
greater degree of polarization and coherence than those in SPO2. We discuss
these results in the context of possible changes in the pick-up conditions from
SPO1 to SPO2, or steady, spatial inhomogeneities in the wave distribution. The
lack of influence from the Solar Wind's convective electric field upon the
location of PCWs indicates that there is no clear relation between the spatial
distribution of PCWs and that of pick-up ions.

selected 46 halo/disk stars covering a wide metallicity range (-3.7 <[Fe/H]<
+0.3), based on the spectral data collected with IRCS+AO188 of the Subaru
Telescope, in order to examine whether and how these strong neutral carbon
lines of multiplet 1 can be exploited for establishing stellar carbon
abundances, especially for very metal-poor stars where CH molecular lines have
been commonly used. These C I lines were confirmed to be clearly visible for
all stars down to [Fe/H] ~ -3.7, from which C abundances could be successfully
determined. The resulting [C/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] diagram revealed almost the same
trend established from previous studies. When the results for individual stars
are compared with the published data collected from various literature, while a
reasonable agreement is seen as a whole, a tendency is observed that our
abundances are appreciably higher than those from CH lines especially for very
metal-poor giants of low gravity. Since the abundances of these C I lines are
subject to rather large non-LTE corrections (typically by several tenths dex)
whose importance progressively grows as the metallicity is lowered, attention
should be paid to how the collisional rates (especially due to neutral
hydrogen) are treated in non-LTE calculations.

metrics on Smale manifolds $M.$ It has already been established in \cite{Gmz2}
that such metrics exist on the so-called torsion free Smale manifolds, i.e. the
$k$-fold connected sum of $S^{2}\times S^{3}.$ Now, we show that LSE metrics
exist on Smale manifolds for which $H_{2}(M,\mathbb{Z})_{tor}$ is nontrivial.
In particular, we show that most simply-connected positive Sasakian rational
homology 5-spheres are also negative Sasakian (hence Lorentzian
Sasaki-Einstein). Moreover, we show that for each pair of positive integers
$(n,s)$ with $n,s >1$, there exists a Lorentzian Sasaki-Einstein Smale manifold
$M$ such that $H_{2}(M,{\mathbb{Z}})_{tors}=(\mathbb{Z}/n)^{2s}$. Finally, we
are able to construct so-called mixed Smale manifolds (connect sum of torsion
free Smale manifolds with rational homology spheres) which admit LSE metrics
and have arbitrary second Betti number. This gives infinitely many examples
which do not admit positive Sasakian structures. These results partially
address the open problems

Gegenschein morphology changed according to the orbital motion of the Earth,
the maximum brightness coincided with the antisolar direction throughout the
year. We compared the observed morphology of the Gegenschein with those of
models in which the spatial density of the interplanetary dust cloud was
considered and found that the volume scattering phase function had a narrow
backscattering enhancement. The morphology was reproducible with a spatial
distribution model for infrared zodiacal emission. It is likely that the
zero-phase peak (the so-called opposition effect) was caused by coherent
backscattering and/or shadow-hiding effects on the rough surfaces of individual
dust particles. These results suggest that big particles are responsible for
both zodiacal light and zodiacal emission. Finally, we derived the geometric
albedo of the smooth component of interplanetary dust, assuming big particles,
and obtained a geometric albedo of 0.06+-0.01. The derived albedo is in
accordance with collected dark micrometeorites and observed cometary dust
particles. We concluded that chondritic particles are dominant near Earth

by the coalescence of binary neutron stars, are believed to be strong
gravitational wave radiation (GWR) sources. The test of such a speculation has
been thought to be impossible until the performance of the detectors like
advanced LIGO. Recently there has been growing evidence for the formation of
highly-magnetized neutron star (i.e., magnetar) in the double neutron star
mergers. In this work we re-examine the interpretation of the X-ray plateau
followed by an abrupt decline detected in some short GRB afterglows within the
supramassive magnetar model and find that the maximum gravitational mass of the
non-rotating neutron stars is $\sim 2.3M_{\odot}$ and the observed duration of
some X-ray plateaus are significantly shorter than that expected in the
magnetic dipole radiation scenario, suggesting that the collapse of the
supramassive magnetars has been considerably enhanced by the energy loss via
GWR. Such a result demonstrates that the signature of GWR may have already
existed in current electromagnetic data of short GRBs.

aspect of the new filter is the gain-like additive update, designed to
approximate the innovation integral in the KS equation and implemented through
an annealing-type iterative procedure, which is aimed at rendering the
innovation (observation-prediction mismatch) for a given time-step to a
zero-mean Brownian increment corresponding to the measurement noise. This may
be contrasted with the weight- based multiplicative updates in most particle
filters that are known to precipitate the numerical problem of weight collapse
within a finite-ensemble setting. A study to estimate the a-priori error bounds
in the proposed scheme is undertaken. The numerical evidence, presently
gathered from the assessed performance of the proposed and a few other

and accuracy of the new filter.

spectral functions of quantum impurity models using the numerical
renormalization group (NRG) technique. It is based on calculating first the
Green's function on the imaginary-frequency axis, followed by an analytic
continuation to the real-frequency axis using Pad\'e approximants. The
arbitrariness in choosing a suitable kernel in the conventional broadening
approach is thereby removed and, furthermore, we find that the Pad\'e method is
able to resolve fine details in spectral functions with less artifacts on the
scale of omega ~ T. We discuss the convergence properties with respect to the
NRG calculation parameters (discretization, truncation cutoff) and the number
of Matsubara points taken into account in the analytic continuation. We test
the technique on the the single-impurity Anderson model and the Hubbard model
(within the dynamical mean-field theory). For the Anderson impurity model, we
discuss the shape of the Kondo resonance and its temperature dependence. For
the Hubbard model, we discuss the inner structure of the Hubbard bands in
metallic and insulating solutions at half-filling, as well as in the doped Mott
insulator. Based on these test cases we conclude that the Pad\'e approximant
approach provides more reliable results for spectral functions at low-frequency
scales of omega < T and that it is capable of resolving sharp spectral features
also at high frequencies. It outperforms broadening in most respects.

time-dependence of a magnetic field induces (in accordance with the Faraday
law) the emergence of source-free electric fields. In comparison with the
Friedmann models, the cosmological expansion goes with acceleration in spatial
directions across the magnetic field, and with deceleration along the magnetic
lines, so that in flat and open models, in fluid comoving coordinates, the
lengths of $\varphi$-circles of large enough radius or for late enough times
decrease and vanish for $t\to\infty$. This means that in flat and open models,
we have a partial dynamical closure of space-time at large distances from the

perfect fluid equations, we assume for the perfect fluid (which supports the

  Then we move on to dynamic tries, where we achieve a worst-case bound of
$O(m+\frac{\lg^{2}\lg\sigma}{\lg\lg\lg\sigma})$ per query or update, which
should again be compared to the previously known $O(m+\lg\sigma)$ deterministic

the stability properties, transport phenomena, and long-term evolution of

These studies have improved our understanding of the physics governing the
intra-cluster medium (ICM), but assumed that ICM is a homogeneous. This,
however, might not be a good approximation if heavy elements sediment in the
inner region of the galaxy cluster. In this paper, we analyze the stability of
a weakly-collisional, magnetized plane-parallel atmosphere which is stratified
in both temperature and composition. This allows us to discuss for the first
time the dynamics of weakly-collisional environments where heat conduction,
momentum transport, and ion-diffusion are anisotropic with respect to the
direction of the magnetic field. We show that, depending on the relative signs
and magnitudes of the gradients in the temperature and the mean molecular
weight, the plasma can be subject to a wide variety of unstable modes which
include modifications to the magnetothermal instability (MTI), the
heat-flux-driven buoyancy instability (HBI), and overstable gravity modes
previously studied in homogeneous media. We discuss the astrophysical
implications of our findings for a representative galaxy cluster where helium
has sedimented. Our findings suggest that the core insulation that results from
the magnetic field configurations that arise as a natural consequence of the
HBI, which would be MTI stable in a homogeneous medium, could be alleviated if
the mean molecular weight gradient is steep enough, i.e., $(\nabla \mu)/\mu >
(\nabla T)/T$. This study constitutes a first step toward understanding the
interaction between magnetic turbulence and the diffusion of heavy elements in
the ICM. (abridged)

been operating flawlessly for more than 36 months. Its main purpose is to map
the anisotropies of the CMB radiation at 9 frequencies, between 30 and 857 GHz,
with unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. After a description of the
properties and cosmological aims of Planck, we review the results obtained
during the first 1.6 full sky surveys relative to compact extragalactic sources
and their implications. The most recent and efficient methods and filters for
compact source detection in the presence of Gaussian noise and CMB anisotropies
are discussed. The first surveys of Planck have enabled the detection of about
200 galaxy clusters, by the SZ effect, and from several hundreds to many
thousands of extragalactic point sources (EPS), presented in the Planck ERCSC.
We review the results on the SZ effect in galaxy clusters. We discuss the
possibilities of future Planck data to study clusters through the SZ effect and
the interesting possibilities of combining these data with X ray observations.
These EPS can be classified into two main source classes: radio sources, at
intermediate to high z; far IR sources, typically at very z. Planck number
counts of EPS at LFI frequencies are in agreement with WMAP counts. A clear
steepening of the mean spectral index of bright radio sources is observed above
70 GHz, that can be interpreted in terms of a break frequency in their spectra.
For nearby dusty galaxies, Planck observations find evidence of colder dust,
with T < 20 K, than has previously been found. More recently, the number counts
of bright local dusty galaxies and of synchrotron sources have been measured by
Planck at submm wavelengths. Planck has provided interesting results on the
angular distribution of CIB anisotropies, allowing us to put new constraints on
clustering properties of dusty galaxies at high z.

species subject to transformations following an imposed stoichiometry. This
paper focuses on the efficient characterisation of dynamical properties of
Discrete Reaction Networks (DRNs). DRNs can be seen as modelling the underlying
discrete nondeterministic transitions of stochastic models of reactions
networks. In that sense, any proof of non-reachability in DRNs directly applies
to any concrete stochastic models, independently of kinetics laws and
constants. Moreover, if stochastic kinetic rates never vanish, reachability
properties are equivalent in the two settings. The analysis of two global
dynamical properties of DRNs is addressed: irreducibility, i.e., the ability to
reach any discrete state from any other state; and recurrence, i.e., the
ability to return to any initial state. Our results consider both the
verification of such properties when species are present in a large copy
number, and in the general case. The obtained necessary and sufficient
conditions involve algebraic conditions on the network reactions which in most
cases can be verified using linear programming. Finally, the relationship of
DRN irreducibility and recurrence with dynamical properties of stochastic and
continuous models of reaction networks is discussed.

the lattice parameter for the renormalized 1s-type Wannier functions. Quantum
critical scaling of the selected physical properties is analyzed as a function

tunneling in quantum dots in order to transfer electrons only at specific
energies. The nanoengine converts heat into electrical current in a
multiterminal geometry which permits one to separate current and heat flows. By
putting two quantum dots in series with a hot cavity, electrons that enter one
lead are forced to gain a prescribed energy in order to exit the opposite lead,
transporting a single electron charge. This condition yields an ideally
efficient heat engine. The energy gain is a property of the composite system
rather than of the individual dots. It is therefore tunable to optimize the
power while keeping a much larger level spacing for the individual quantum
dots. Despite the simplicity of the physical model, the optimized rectified
current and power is larger than any other candidate nano-engine. The ability
to scale the power by putting many such engines into a two-dimensional layered
structure gives a paradigmatic system for harvesting thermal energy at the
nanoscale. We demonstrate that the high power and efficiency of the layered
structure persists even if the quantum dots exhibit some randomness.

curved continuum emission and the overall spectral energy distribution indicate
a non-thermal emission, other features such as the iron line emission and the

was obtained by the MOST and CoRoT satellites in 4 separate new observing runs
that are put into context with the star's fundamental atmospheric parameters
obtained from spectroscopy. With the new MOST data set from 2011/12 and the two
CoRoT light curves from 2008 and 2011/12, the delta Scuti variability was
confirmed and regular groups of frequencies were discovered. The two pulsation
frequencies identified in the data from the first MOST observing run in 2006
are confirmed and 23 new delta Scuti-type frequencies were discovered using the
CoRoT data. Weighted average frequencies for each group are related to l=0 and
l=1 p-modes. Evidence for amplitude modulation of the frequencies in two groups
is seen. The effective temperature was derived to be 8600$\pm$200 K, log g is
4.1$\pm$0.2, and the projected rotational velocity is 53$\pm$1km/s. Using our
Teff value and the radius of 1.8$\pm$0.5 Rsun derived from SED fitting, we get
a log L/Lsun of 1.20$\pm$0.14 which agrees well to the seismologically
determined values of 1.65 Rsun and, hence, a log L/Lsun of 1.13. The radial
velocity of 14$\pm$2 km/s we derived for HD 261711, confirms the star's
membership to NGC 2264. Our asteroseismic models suggest that HD 261711 is a
delta Scuti-type star close to the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) with a mass of

length shows that the wire diameter increases with distance from the ends,
longer samples often showing evident damage and leaks provoked by the internal
gas pressure. Comparison of heat treatments carried out just below the melting
point and with the usual melt process makes it clear that melting is crucial to
developing high internal pressure. The decay of Jc away from the ends is
directly correlated to the local wire diameter increase, which decreases the
local Bi-2212 filament mass density and lowers Jc, often by well over 50%. It
is clear that control of the internal gas pressure is crucial to attaining the

burns C+O into O+Ne+Mg. (3) SD-subCh: In the single degenerate (SD) scenario,

enough, they still produce interesting amount of Si and S near the surface of
C+O WD before the explosion. In the Chandra mass explosion, the central density
is high enough to produce electron capture elements, e.g., stable Ni-58.

to alleviate the smallness (fine-tuning) of the quartic coupling $\lambda$ in
the chaotic inflation with $\phi^4$ potential. A large $\xi$ is required to
obtain the correct CMB power spectrum while we find that a small value $\sim
1/6$ seems to be preferred from spectral index. There are issues related to
conformal transformations, choice of frame and natural value(s) of $\xi$ for a
given potential. We revisit some of these issues and invoke certain field
theoretic arguments in order to address the same. A rather strong and general
conclusion reached, based on the requirements of renormalizability and
finiteness of specific matrix elements in a quantum theory, is that it is
generically not possible to eliminate the non-minimal coupling by going from
the Jordan to the Einstein frame via conformal transformations. We also comment
on Higgs inflation.

colour-magnitude diagrams of intermediate age (1-2 Gyr) clusters in the LMC are
broader than would be nominally expected for a simple stellar population. This
has led to the suggestion that such clusters may host multiple stellar
populations, with age spreads of 100-500 Myr. However, at intermediate ages,
spreads of this magnitude are difficult to discern and alternative explanations
have been put forward (e.g., stellar rotation, interacting binaries). A
prediction of the age-spread scenario is that younger clusters in the LMC, with
similar masses and radii, should also show significant age spreads. In younger
clusters (i.e., 40-300 Myr) such large age spreads should be readily apparent.
We present an analysis of the colour-magnitude diagrams of two massive young
clusters in the LMC (NGC 1856 and NGC 1866) and show that neither have such
large age spreads, in fact, both are consistent with a single burst of
star-formation (sigma(age) < 35 Myr). This leads us to conclude that either the
intermediate age clusters in the LMC are somehow special or that the broadened
MSTOs are not due to an age spread within the clusters.

an infinite set of periodic points of arbitrarily big period. Moreover, a
reduction of the considered map is semi-conjugated to a shift on the set of
one-sided infinite boolean sequences. Also, we find conditions, sufficient for
existence of a superstable periodic point of this map. The obtained result
partially solves a general problem: theoretical confirmation of chaotic and

immediately realized that it was a Type Ia supernova thus making this event the
brightest one discovered in the last twenty years. The distance of the event
offered the rare opportunity to perform a detailed observation with the
instruments on board of INTEGRAL to detect the gamma-ray emission expected from
the decay chains of $^{56}$Ni. The observations were performed in two runs, one
before and around the optical maximum, aimed to detect the early emission from
the decay of $^{56}$Ni and another after this maximum aimed to detect the
emission of $^{56}$Co. The observations performed with the instruments on board
of INTEGRAL (SPI, IBIS/ISGRI, JEMX and OMC) have been analyzed and compared
with the existing models of gamma-ray emission from such kind of supernovae. In
this paper, the analysis of the gamma-ray emission has been restricted to the
first epoch. Both, SPI and IBIS/ISGRI, only provide upper-limits to the
expected emission due to the decay of $^{56}$Ni. These upper-limits on the
gamma-ray flux are of 7.1 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ ph/s/cm$^2$ for the 158 keV line
and of 2.3 $\times$ 10$^{-4}$ ph/s/cm$^2$ for the 812 keV line. These bounds
allow to reject at the $2\sigma$ level explosions involving a massive white
dwarf, $\sim 1$ M$\odot$ in the sub--Chandrasekhar scenario and specifically
all models that would have substantial amounts of radioactive $^{56}$Ni in the
outer layers of the exploding star responsible of the SN2011fe event. The
optical light curve obtained with the OMC camera also suggests that SN2011fe
was the outcome of the explosion, possibly a delayed detonation although other
models are possible, of a CO white dwarf that synthesized $\sim 0.55$ M$_\odot$
of $^{56}$Ni. For this specific model.

the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of the coronal fluctuation
power has been performed over the whole plane of the sky, from 1.4 to 4.0 solar
radii. The adopted diagnostic tool is based on wavelet transforms. This
technique, with respect to the standard Fourier analysis, has the advantage of
localizing non-persistent fluctuating features and exploring the variations of
the relating wavelet power in both space and time. The map of the variance of
the coronal brightness clearly outlines intermittent, spatially coherent
fluctuating features, localized along, or adjacent to, the strongest magnetic
field lines. In most cases they do not correspond to the coronal structures
visible in the brightness maps. The results obtained provide a scenario in
which the solar corona shows quasi-periodic, non-stationary density variations
characterized by a wide range of temporal and spatial scales and strongly
confined by the magnetic field topology. In addition, structures fluctuating
with larger power are larger in size and evolve more slowly. The characteristic
periodicities of the fluctuations are comparable to their lifetimes. This
suggests either that plasma fluctuations lasting only one or two wave periods
and initially characterized by a single dominant periodicity, rapidly decay
into a turbulent mixed flow via nonlinear interactions with other plasma modes,
or that they are damped by thermal conduction. [...]

is now known to be predominantly due to interstellar scintillation (ISS). The
MASIV (The Micro-Arcsecond Scintillation-Induced Variability) survey of 443
flat spectrum sources revealed that the IDV is related to the radio flux
density and redshift. A study of the physical properties of these sources has
been severely handicapped by the absence of reliable redshift measurements for
many of these objects. This paper presents 79 new redshifts and a critical
evaluation of 233 redshifts obtained from the literature. We classify
spectroscopic identifications based on emission line properties, finding that
78% of the sources have broad emission lines and are mainly FSRQs. About 16%
are weak lined objects, chiefly BL Lacs, and the remaining 6% are narrow line
objects. The gross properties (redshift, spectroscopic class) of the MASIV
sample are similar to those of other blazar surveys. However, the extreme
compactness implied by ISS favors FSRQs and BL Lacs in the MASIV sample as
these are the most compact object classes. We confirm that the level of IDV
depends on the 5\,GHz flux density for all optical spectral types. We find that
BL Lac objects tend to be more variable than broad line quasars. The level of
ISS decreases substantially above a redshift of about two. The decrease is
found to be generally consistent with ISS expected for beamed emission from a
jet that is limited to a fixed maximum brightness temperature in the source
rest frame.

collider LEP at CERN from 1995 to 2000 are reported. The combined data set
considered in this report corresponds to a total luminosity of about 3
fb$^{-1}$ collected by the four LEP experiments ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL, at
centre-of-mass energies ranging from 130 GeV to 209 GeV.
  Combining the published results of the four LEP experiments, the measurements
include total and differential cross-sections in photon-pair, fermion-pair and
four-fermion production, the latter resulting from both double-resonant WW and
ZZ production as well as singly resonant production. Total and differential
cross-sections are measured precisely, providing a stringent test of the
Standard Model at centre-of-mass energies never explored before in
electron-positron collisions. Final-state interaction effects in four-fermion
production, such as those arising from colour reconnection and Bose-Einstein
correlations between the two W decay systems arising in WW production, are
searched for and upper limits on the strength of possible effects are obtained.
The data are used to determine fundamental properties of the W boson and the
electroweak theory. Among others, the mass and width of the W boson, $M_W$ and
$\Gamma_W$, the branching fraction of W decays to hadrons,
$B(W\to\mathrm{had})$, and the trilinear gauge-boson self-couplings $g^Z_1$,
$\kappa_\gamma$ and $\lambda_\gamma$ are determined to be:
  M_W = 80.376 \pm 0.033 ~GeV
  \Gamma_W = 2.195 \pm 0.083 ~GeV
  B(W\to\mathrm{had}) = 67.41 \pm 0.27 % g^Z_1 = 0.984 ^{+0.018}_{-0.020}
  \kappa_\gamma = 0.982 \pm 0.042
  \lambda_\gamma = -0.022 \pm 0.019

study the problem of designing efficient {\em partition oracles}. A {\em
partition oracle} is a procedure that, given access to the incidence lists
representation of a bounded-degree graph $G= (V,E)$ and a parameter $\eps$,
when queried on a vertex $v\in V$, returns the part (subset of vertices) which
$v$ belongs to in a partition of all graph vertices. The partition should be
such that all parts are small, each part is connected, and if the graph has
certain properties, the total number of edges between parts is at most $\eps
|V|$. In this work we give a partition oracle for graphs with excluded minors
whose query complexity is quasi-polynomial in $1/\eps$, thus improving on the
result of Hassidim et al. ({\em Proceedings of FOCS 2009}) who gave a partition
oracle with query complexity exponential in $1/\eps$. This improvement implies
corresponding improvements in the complexity of testing planarity and other
properties that are characterized by excluded minors as well as sublinear-time
approximation algorithms that work under the promise that the graph has an
excluded minor.

the efficacies of various algorithms and observing strategies applicable for
transient detection. We present examples that illustrate the methodologies of
detecting short-duration transients, including the use of sub-arrays for higher

cloud (VMR-D), based on Spitzer -IRAC data between 3.6 and 8.0 micron. Our
search has led to the identification of 15 jets and about 70 well aligned knots
within 1.2 squared degree. We compare the IRAC maps with observations of the H2
1-0 S(1) line at 2.12 micron, with a Spitzer-MIPS map at 24 and 70 micron, and
with a map of the dust continuum emission at 1.2 mm. We find a association
between molecular jets and dust peaks. The jet candidate exciting sources have
been searched for in the published catalog of the Young Stellar Objects of
VMR-D. We selected all the sources of Class II or earlier which are located
close to the jet center and aligned with it.The association between jet and
exciting source was validated by estimating the differential extinction between
the jet opposite lobes. We are able to find a best-candidate exciting source in
all but two jets. Four exciting sources are not (or very barely) observed at
wavelengths shorter than 24 micron, suggesting they are very young protostars.
Three of them are also associated with the most compact jets. The exciting
source Spectral Energy Distributions have been modeled by means of the
photometric data between 1.2 micron and 1.2 mm. From SEDs fits we derive the
main source parameters, which indicate that most of them are low-mass
protostars. A significant correlation is found between the projected jet length
and the [24] - [70] color, which is consistent with an evolutionary scenario
according to which shorter jets are associated with younger sources. A rough
correlation is found between IRAC line cooling and exciting source bolometric
luminosity, in agreement with the previous literature. The emerging trend
suggests that mass loss and mass accretion are tightly related phenomena and
that both decrease with time.

independent tuning of the perpendicular electric field and the Fermi level over

magnitude in the ABC trilayer, which demonstrates the opening of a band gap.
Our data suggest that the gap saturates at a large displacement field of D ~ 3

ABA trilayer remains metallic even under a large perpendicular electric field.
Despite the absence of a band gap, the band structure of the ABA trilayer

Their outbursts are commonly classified into a simple scheme of 'normal' and
'giant' outbursts, but a closer look shows that actual outbursts do not always
follow this simple scheme. Recent data show a variety of properties, like
pre-flares, shifts of the outburst peaks with respect to the periastron,
multi-peaked outbursts etc. We present results from a systematic study of a
large number of outbursts monitored by various space missions, comparing
outburst properties and their relation to system parameters and current
theoretical understanding.

sources made from organic semiconductor materials. Over the last decades, much
research has been spent on finding the suitable materials to realize highly
efficient monochrome and white OLEDs. With their high efficiency,
color-tunability, and color-quality, white OLEDs are emerging to become one of
the next generation light sources. In this review, we discuss the physics of a
variety of device concepts that are introduced to realize white OLEDs based on
both polymer and small molecule organic materi als. Owing to the fact that
about 80 % of the internally generated photons are trapped within the thin-film
layer structure, we put a second focus on reviewing promising concepts for
improved light outcoupling.

introduced {\em pattern matching with character classes} and provided the first
efficient algorithm to solve it. The best known solution to date is due to
Linhart and Shamir (2009).
  Another broad yet comparatively less studied class of string matching
problems is that of numerical string searching, such as, e.g., the `less-than'
or $L_1$-norm string searching. The best known solutions for problems in this
class are based on FFT convolution after some suitable re-encoding.
  The present paper introduces {\em modulated string searching} as a unified
framework for string matching problems where the numerical conditions can be
combined with some Boolean/numerical decision conditions on the character
classes. One example problem in this class is the {\em locally bounded
$L_1$-norm} matching problem on character classes: here the ""match"" between a
character at some position in the text and a set of characters at some position
in the pattern is assessed based on the smallest $L_1$ distance between the
text character and one of those pattern characters. The two positions ""match""
if the (absolute value of the) difference between the two characters does not
exceed a predefined constant. The pattern has an occurrence in an alignment
with the text if the sum of all such differences does not exceed a second
predefined constant value. This problem requires a pointwise evaluation of the
quality of each match and has no known solution based on the previously
mentioned algorithms.

mutations in a population of finite size. A click of the ratchet occurs when
all individuals with the least number of deleterious mutations are lost
irreversibly due to a stochastic fluctuation. In spite of the simplicity of the
model, a quantitative understanding of the process remains an open challenge.
In contrast to previous works, we here study a Moran model of the ratchet with
overlapping generations. Employing an approximation which describes the fittest
individuals as one class and the rest as a second class, we obtain closed
analytical expressions of the ratchet rate in the rare clicking regime. As a
click in this regime is caused by a rare large fluctuation from a metastable
state, we do not resort to a diffusion approximation but apply an approximation
scheme which is especially well suited to describe extinction events from
metastable states. This method also allows for a derivation of expressions for
the quasi-stationary distribution of the fittest class. Additionally, we
confirm numerically that the formulation with overlapping generations leads to
the same results as the diffusion approximation and the corresponding
Wright-Fisher model with non-overlapping generations.

Paths Routing Algorithm"". Its application to traffic flow in scale-free
networks shows a great improvement over the so called ""efficient routing""
protocol while at the same time maintaining a relatively low average packet
travel time. It has the advantage of minimizing path overlapping throughout the
network in a self consistent manner with a relatively small number of
iterations by maintaining an equilibrated path distribution especially among
the hubs. This results in a significant shifting of the critical packet
generation rate over which traffic congestion occurs, thus permitting the
network to sustain more information packets in the free flow state. The
performance of the algorithm is discussed both on a Bar\'abasi-Albert (BA)
network and real autonomous system (AS) network data.

spectral energy distributions with the lepton models. The derived gamma_b (the
break Lorenz factor of the electron distribution) are 10^4-10^6 for Mrk 501 and
200~600 for 3C 279 and the magnetic field strength (B) of Mrk 501 is usually
one order of magnitude lower than that of 3C 279, but their Doppler factors
(delta) are comparable. A spectral variation feature that the peak luminosity
is correlated with the peak frequency, which is opposite to the blazar
sequence, is observed in the two sources. We find that (1) the peak
luminosities of the two bumps in SEDs for Mrk 501 depend on gamma_b in both the
observer and co-moving frames, but they are not correlated with B and delta;
(2)the luminosity variation of 3C 279 is dominated by the external Compton (EC)
peak and its peak luminosity is correlated with gamma_b and delta, but
anti-correlated with B. These results suggest that gamma_b may govern the
spectral variation of Mrk 501 and delta and B would be responsible for the
spectral variation of 3C 279. The narrow distribution of gamma_b and the
correlation of gamma_b and B in 3C 279 would be due to the cooling by the EC
process and the strong magnetic field. Based on our brief discussion, we
propose that this spectral variation feature may be originated from the
instability of the corona but not from the variation of the accretion rate as
that for the blazar sequence.

adequately described, up to oscillation amplitudes of $\pi/2$, by a sinusoidal
temporal behaviour with a frequency proportional to the square root of the

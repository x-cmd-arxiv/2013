collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$=2.76 TeV has been measured by ALICE as a
function of centrality in the e$^+$e$^-$ decay channel at mid-rapidity
$|y|<0.8$ and as a function of centrality, transverse momentum and rapidity in
the $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ decay channel at forward-rapidity $2.5<y<4$.The $J/\psi$
yields measured in Pb-Pb are suppressed compared to those in pp collisions
scaled by the number of binary collisions. The $R_{\rm AA}$ integrated over a
centrality range corresponding to 90% of the inelastic Pb-Pb cross section is
$0.72\pm0.06$ (stat.) $\pm0.10$ (syst.) at mid-rapidity and $0.57 \pm 0.01$
(stat.) $\pm0.09$ (syst.) at forward-rapidity. At low transverse momentum,
significantly larger values of $R_{\rm AA}$ are measured at forward-rapidity
compared to measurements at lower energy. These features suggest that a
contribution to the $J/\psi$ yield originates from charm quarks (re)combination
in the deconfined partonic medium.

RI Beam Factory. The PPAC detector plays an important role not only in the
tuning of the separator and delivery lines but also in the particle
identification of rare isotope (RI) beams. The PPAC detector has a sensitive
area of 240 mm x 150 mm, and the position information is obtained by a
delay-line readout method. Being called double PPAC, it is composed of two full
PPACs, each measuring the particle locus in two dimensions. High detection
efficiency has been made possible by the twofold measurement using the double
PPAC detector. The sensitivity uniformity is also found to be excellent. The
root-mean-square position resolution is measured to be 0.25 mm using an alpha
source, while the position linearity is as good as +/-0.1 mm for the detector
size of 240 mm. Characteristics, operating principles, specifications,
performance and issues of the PPAC detector are presented, including its signal

equations of all gravitational theories with Lagrangian being a polynomial
curvature invariant constructed from the metric, the Riemann tensor and its

discussed as metrics with vanishing quantum corrections and as classical
solutions to string theory. Widely known examples of universal metrics are
certain Ricci-flat pp waves.
  In this paper, we start a general study of geometric properties of universal
metrics in arbitrary dimension and we arrive at a broader class of such
metrics. In contrast with pp waves, these universal metrics also admit
non-vanishing cosmological constant and in general do not have to possess a
covariantly constant or recurrent null vector field. First, we show that a
universal spacetime is necessarily a CSI spacetime, i.e. all curvature
invariants constructed from the Riemann tensor and its derivatives are
constant. Then we focus on type N spacetimes, where we arrive at a simple
necessary and sufficient condition: a type N spacetime is universal if and only
if it is an Einstein Kundt spacetime. A class of type III Kundt universal
metrics is also found. Several explicit examples of universal metrics are

teor activity on Earth on 2014 May 24; however, exact timing and activity level
is difficult to estimate due to the limited physical observations of the comet.
Here we reanalyze the optical observations of 209P/LINEAR obtained during its
2009 appari- tion. We find that the comet is relatively depleted in dust
production, with Af {\rho} at 1 cm level within eight months around its
perihelion. This feature suggested that this comet may be currently
transitioning from typical comet to a dormant comet. Syn- dyne simulation shows
that the optical cometary tail is dominated by larger particles with {\beta} ~
0.003. Numerical simulations of the cometary dust trails confirm the arrival of
particles on 2014 May 24 from some of the 1798-1979 trails. The nominal radiant
is at RA 122 +/- 1 deg, Dec 79 +/- 1 deg (J2000) in the constellation of
Camelopardalis. Given that the comet is found to be depleted in dust
production, we concluded that a meteor storm (ZHR>=1000) may be unlikely.
However, our simulation also shows that the size distribution of the arrived
particles is skewed strongly to larger particles. Coupling with the result of
syndyne simulation, we think that the event, if detectable, may be dominated by
bright meteors. We encourage observers to monitor the expected meteor event as
it will provide us with rare direct information on the dynamical history of
209P/LINEAR which is otherwise irretrievably lost.

contrasted with the ferromagnetism of bulk LCO, which also starts at T_C
approximately 87K but is suppressed below a second transition at T_o
approximately 37K, due to a structural phase transition. The ferromagnetism in
both systems is attributed to the tensile stress from particle surfaces and
impurity phase interfaces. This stress locally increases the Co-O-Co bond angle
gamma, and competes with the thermal contraction of the lattice. It has
recently been shown that LCO loses long-range ferromagnetic order when gamma

  We show that the Bitcoin protocol is not incentive-compatible. We present an

miners will prefer to join the selfish miners, and the colluding group will
increase in size until it becomes a majority. At this point, the Bitcoin system
ceases to be a decentralized currency.
  Selfish mining is feasible for any group size of colluding miners. We propose
a practical modification to the Bitcoin protocol that protects against selfish
mining pools that command less than 1/4 of the resources. This threshold is
lower than the wrongly assumed 1/2 bound, but better than the current reality
where a group of any size can compromise the system.

local communications. Coordination usually requires sufficient information
flow, which is usually depicted by the connectivity of the communication
network. In a networked system, removal of some agents may cause a
disconnection. In order to maintain connectivity in agent removal, one can
design a robust network topology that tolerates a finite number of agent
losses, and/or develop a control strategy that recovers connectivity. This
paper proposes a decentralized control scheme based on a sequence of
replacements, each of which occurs between an agent and one of its immediate
neighbors. The replacements always end with an agent, whose relocation does not
cause a disconnection. We show that such an agent can be reached by a local
rule utilizing only some local information available in agents' immediate
neighborhoods. As such, the proposed message passing strategy guarantees the
connectivity maintenance in arbitrary agent removal. Furthermore, we
significantly improve the optimality of the proposed scheme by incorporating
$\delta$-criticality (i.e. the criticality of an agent in its
$\delta$-neighborhood).

places a maximum value on the local radial velocity dispersion. For a plausible
range of halo parameters, it is possible to take a local total velocity
dispersion of up to about $300\,\mathrm{km/s}$. Making this choice uniquely
specifies the anisotropy and dispersion profiles. We introduce a way to model
the local velocity distribution that incorporates this anisotropy and study the
impact on direct detection.

  Cybersecurity","12 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A significant limitation of current cyber security research and techniques is
its reactive and applied nature. This leads to a continuous 'cyber cycle' of
attackers scanning networks, developing exploits and attacking systems, with
defenders detecting attacks, analyzing exploits and patching systems. This
reactive nature leaves sensitive systems highly vulnerable to attack due to
un-patched systems and undetected exploits. Some current research attempts to
address this major limitation by introducing systems that implement moving
target defense. However, these ideas are typically based on the intuition that
a moving target defense will make it much harder for attackers to find and scan
vulnerable systems, and not on theoretical mathematical foundations. The
continuing lack of fundamental science and principles for developing more
secure systems has drawn increased interest into establishing a 'science of
cyber security'. This paper introduces the concept of using cybernetics, an
interdisciplinary approach of control theory, systems theory, information
theory and game theory applied to regulatory systems, as a foundational
approach for developing cyber security principles. It explores potential
applications of cybernetics to cyber security from a defensive perspective,
while suggesting the potential use for offensive applications. Additionally,
this paper introduces the fundamental principles for building non-stationary
systems, which is a more general solution than moving target defenses. Lastly,
the paper discusses related works concerning the limitations of moving target
defense and one implementation based on non-stationary principles.

components entangled within a signal. Contemporary signal processing presents a
host of difficult source separation problems, from interference cancellation to
background subtraction, blind deconvolution, and even dictionary learning.
Despite the recent progress in each of these applications, advances in
high-throughput sensor technology place demixing algorithms under pressure to
accommodate extremely high-dimensional signals, separate an ever larger number
of sources, and cope with more sophisticated signal and mixing models. These
difficulties are exacerbated by the need for real-time action in automated
decision-making systems.
  Recent advances in convex optimization provide a simple framework for
efficiently solving numerous difficult demixing problems. This article provides
an overview of the emerging field, explains the theory that governs the
underlying procedures, and surveys algorithms that solve them efficiently. We
aim to equip practitioners with a toolkit for constructing their own demixing
algorithms that work, as well as concrete intuition for why they work.

monotonously decaying density profile collapses and forms a shell-focussing
singularity. Provided the density profile is not too flat, meaning that its
second radial derivative is negative at the center, this singularity is visible
to local, and sometimes even to global observers. According to the strong
cosmic censorship conjecture, such naked singularities should be unstable under
generic, nonspherical perturbations of the initial data or when more realistic
matter models are considered.
  In an attempt to gain some understanding about this stability issue, in this
work we initiate the analysis of a simpler but related problem. We discuss the
stability of test fields propagating in the vicinity of the Cauchy horizon
associated to the naked central singularity. We first study the high-frequency
limit and show that the fields undergo a blueshift as they approach the Cauchy
horizon. However, in contrast to what occurs at inner horizons of black holes,
we show that the blueshift is uniformly bounded along incoming and outgoing
null rays. Motivated by this boundedness result, we take a step beyond the
geometric optic approximation and consider the Cauchy evolution of spherically
symmetric test scalar fields. We prove that under reasonable conditions on the
initial data a suitable rescaled field can be continuously extended to the
Cauchy horizon. In particular, this result implies that the physical field is
everywhere finite on the Cauchy horizon away from the central singularity.

Central Limit Theorem (CLT), when assuming aggregation of independent and

choice of modeling, in particular using light tail distributions, has proven
during the crisis of 2008/2009 to be an inadequate approximation when dealing

comparable to or exceeds the sample size $n$, a successful approach uses an
$\ell_1$-penalized least squares estimator, known as Lasso. Unfortunately,
unlike for linear estimators (e.g., ordinary least squares), no
well-established method exists to compute confidence intervals or p-values on
the basis of the Lasso estimator. Very recently, a line of work
\cite{javanmard2013hypothesis, confidenceJM, GBR-hypothesis} has addressed this
problem by constructing a debiased version of the Lasso estimator. In this
paper, we study this approach for random design model, under the assumption
that a good estimator exists for the precision matrix of the design. Our
analysis improves over the state of the art in that it establishes nearly
optimal \emph{average} testing power if the sample size $n$ asymptotically
dominates $s_0 (\log p)^2$, with $s_0$ being the sparsity level (number of
non-zero coefficients). Earlier work obtains provable guarantees only for much
larger sample size, namely it requires $n$ to asymptotically dominate $(s_0
\log p)^2$.
  In particular, for random designs with a sparse precision matrix we show that
an estimator thereof having the required properties can be computed
efficiently. Finally, we evaluate this approach on synthetic data and compare
it with earlier proposals.

collisions at sqrt{s}=200GeV and their transverse momentum spectra within the
Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach. As sources for
'direct' photons, we incorporate the interactions of quarks and gluons as well
as hadronic interactions (pi+pi->rho+gamma, rho+pi->pi+gamma, meson-meson
bremsstrahlung m+m->m+m+gamma, meson-baryon bremsstrahlung m+B->m+B+gamma), the
decays of phi and a_1 mesons and the photons produced in the initial hard
collisions ('pQCD'). We find that the pT spectra of the 'thermal' photons (i.e.
the direct photons after the pQCD contribution is subtracted) deviate from
exponential distributions and, consequently, observe a strong dependence of the
inverse slope parameter T_eff on the fitting range in pT. On the other hand,
all the obtained 'effective temperatures' are well above the critical
temperature for the deconfinement phase transition even for peripheral
collisions, reflecting primarily a 'blue shift' due to radial collective motion
of hadrons. Our calculations suggest that the channel decomposition of the
observed spectrum changes with centrality with an increasing (dominant)
contribution of hadronic sources for more peripheral reactions. Furthermore,
the thermal photon yield is found to scale roughly with the number of
participant nucleons as N_part^alpha with alpha=1.5, whereas the partonic
contribution scales with an exponent alpha_p=1.75. Additionally, we provide
predictions for the centrality dependence of the direct photon elliptic flow
v_2(pT). The direct photon $v_2$ is seen to be larger in peripheral collisions
compared to the most central ones since the photons from the hot deconfined

in perturbation theory and we verify that the effect of soft modes always
cancels out in equal-time correlators. Second, we write the relations directly
in redshift space, without assuming the single-stream approximation: not only
the long mode affects the short scales as a homogeneous gravitational field,
but it also displaces them by its velocity along the line-of-sight. Redshift
space consistency relations still vanish when short modes are taken at equal

danger of exomoons to be in a runaway greenhouse (RG) state due to extensive
heating from the planet. We apply pre-computed evolution tracks for giant
planets to calculate the incident planetary radiation on the moon as a function
of time. The total energy budget of stellar flux, illumination from the planet,
and tidal heating in the satellite is compared to the critical flux for the
moon to experience an RG effect. Irradiation from a 13-Jupiter-mass planet onto
an Earth-sized moon at a distance of ten Jupiter radii can drive an RG state on
the moon for about 200 Myr. If stellar illumination equivalent to that received
by Earth from the Sun is added, the RG holds for about 500 Myr. After 1000 Myr,
the planet's habitable edge has moved inward to about 6 planetary radii.
Exomoons in orbits with eccentricities of 0.1 experience strong tidal heating;
they must orbit a 13-Jupiter-mass host beyond 29 or 18 Jupiter radii after 100
Myr (at the inner and outer boundaries of the stellar HZ, respectively), and
beyond 13 Jupiter radii (in both cases) after 1000 Myr to be habitable. If a
roughly Earth-sized moon would be detected in orbit around a giant planet, and
if this binary would orbit in the stellar HZ, then it will be crucial to
recover the moon's orbital history. If such a moon around a 13-Jupiter-mass
planet has been closer than 20 Jupiter radii to its host during the first few
hundred million years at least, then it might have lost substantial amounts of
its initial water reservoir and be uninhabitable today.

transition which can be explained with a Landau free energy model including a
linear-quadratic coupling energy term between the appropriate elastic strain
$e$ and the spin-Peierls magnetic gap $\Delta_q$. The analysis of the
dielectric and elastic features aims toward an order parameter with an
associated critical exponent $\beta \sim$ 0.36, which is similar to the
three-dimensional behavior seen in other spin-Peierls materials. All these
effects studied in a magnetic field up to 18 Teslas appear also compatible with
a mean-field model of a quasi-one-dimensional spin-Peierls system.

H_2 and optical line ratios diagnostic of such shocks. The galaxies powered by

that excess H_2 emission is produced as the supernovae and active nuclei drive
outflows into the neutral interstellar medium of the ULIRGs. A weak positive
correlation between H_2 and the length of the tidal tails indicates that these
outflows are more likely to be encountered in more advanced mergers, but there

on the distribution of planetary radii, particularly for the new populations of

interpretation of these radii, we compute model radii for low-mass rocky
planets with hydrogen-helium envelopes. We provide model radii for planets 1-20
Earth masses, with envelope fractions from 0.01-20%, levels of irradiation
0.1-1000x Earth's, and ages from 100 Myr to 10 Gyr. In addition we provide
simple analytic fits that summarize how radius depends on each of these
parameters. Most importantly, we show that at fixed composition, radii show
little dependence on mass for planets with more than ~1% of their mass in their
envelope. Consequently, planetary radius is to first order a proxy for
planetary composition for Neptune and sub-Neptune sized planets. We recast the
observed mass-radius relationship as a mass-composition relationship and
discuss it in light of traditional core accretion theory. We discuss the
transition from rocky super-Earths to sub-Neptune planets with large volatile
envelopes. We suggest 1.75 Earth radii as a physically motivated dividing line

quantum spin liquids, or classically disordered states, such as spin ices or
spin glasses. Geometric frustration may play a similar role in charge ordering,
potentially leading to unconventional electronic states without long-range

phenomenon. Here, we show that a charge-cluster glass evolves upon cooling in
the absence of long-range charge ordering for an organic conductor with a
triangular lattice, theta-(BEDT-TTF)2RbZn(SCN)4. A combination of time-resolved
transport measurements and x-ray diffraction reveal that the charge-liquid
phase has charge clusters that fluctuate extremely slowly (<10-100 Hz) and
heterogeneously. Upon further cooling, the cluster dynamics freeze, and a
charge-cluster glass is formed. Surprisingly, these observations correspond to
recent ideas regarding the structural glass formation of supercooled liquids,
indicating that a glass-forming charge liquid relates correlated-electron
physics to glass physics in soft matter.

we are able to measure the quantum mobility of our device. It is found that at

equivalent probabilistic interpretations, which yields the so called nonlinear
Feymman-Kac formula. By adopting such formula, we consider in this work a novel
numerical approach for solutions of hyperbolic conservation laws. Our numerical
method consists in efficiently computing the viscosity solutions of
conservation laws. However, instead of solving the viscosity problem directly
(which is difficult), we find its equivalent probabilistic solution by adopting
the Feymman-Kac formula, which relies on solving the equivalent forward
backward stochastic differential equations. It is noticed that such framework
possesses the following advantages: (i) the viscosity parameter can be chosen
sufficiently small (say $10^{-10}$); (ii) the computational procedure on each
discretized time level can be \textit{completely parallel}; (iii) the
traditional CFL condition is dramatically weakened; (iv) one does not need to

relativistic, to the extent that multiple critical points, shocks etc do not
form. The most relativistic fluid is the one whose ratio of proton to electron
number density is ~ 0.2. Since the solution strongly depend on composition, the
emitted radiation should strongly depend on the composition too.

loop higher genus contribution to the gravity action in type IIB string theory
inspired low energy supergravity theory in the light of gravidilatonic
interactions on the lightest Kaluza-Klein graviton mass spectrum. From the
latest constraints on the lightest Kaluza-Klein graviton mass as obtained from
the ATLAS dilepton search in 7 TeV proton-proton collision, we have shown that
due to the presence of Gauss-Bonnet and string loop corrections, the warping
solution in an ${\bf AdS_{5}}$ bulk is quite distinct from Randall-Sundrum
scenario. We discuss the constraints on the model parameters to fit with
present ATLAS data.

cartesian product and corona of two weak IASI graphs and their admissibility of
weak integer additive set-indexers and provide some useful results on these

including chemical processing, pharmaceutical processing, energy conversion and
powder transport. However, despite decades of research and industrial
application, the real time behavior of particle flow fields is still not well
understood. One of the main reasons is that experimental data is difficult to
acquire in such harsh, opaque particle flow environments. In this educational
video for the Gallery of Fluid Motion, high speed video acquired with a new,
patented high speed particle imaging velocimetry (high speed PIV) technology is
presented. This technology was developed by the USDOE National Energy
Technology Laboratory (NETL). It is being applied to observe and measure the
real time behavior of individual particle motion inside particle flow fields of
high particle concentration for the first time. The high speed PIV system
records high speed videos of particle motion with excellent spatial and
temporal clarity. The high speed videos are analyzed to measure the
concentration and the two-dimensional motion (velocity and trajectory) of
individual particles. Data sample rates for velocity vectors are in the range
of 0.1 to 3 million vectors per second, thereby providing full resolution of
the temporal domain of particle velocity. To see and measure particle motion
inside the flow fields at high particle concentrations, a custom borescope is
inserted into particle flow fields.
  The particle tracking technique can measure gas and fluid flow if the
particles are small enough (have a low enough Stokes number) to follow the
gas/fluid flow. In areas of rapid mixing, such as turbulent wakes, particle
tracking can provide better spatial resolution that conventional
cross-correlation based PIV analysis.

as in the category of groups? Firstly, we express concepts in categorical
language that capture group properties. We then observe the results about
topological groups now extended to varieties of topological algebras. We
conclude showing that for topological algebras obeying certain axioms, there
exist semi-direct products which we caracterize like in [17].

monitor complex natural phenomena. Recent research works have intensively
studied distributed optimization problems in the case where the nodes have to
estimate a single optimum parameter vector collaboratively. However, there are
many important applications that are multitask-oriented in the sense that there
are multiple optimum parameter vectors to be inferred simultaneously, in a
collaborative manner, over the area covered by the network. In this paper, we
employ diffusion strategies to develop distributed algorithms that address
multitask problems by minimizing an appropriate mean-square error criterion
with $\ell_2$-regularization. The stability and convergence of the algorithm in
the mean and in the mean-square sense is analyzed. Simulations are conducted to
verify the theoretical findings, and to illustrate how the distributed strategy
can be used in several useful applications related to spectral sensing, target
localization, and hyperspectral data unmixing.

Although the absence of orbital moment precludes crystal electric field
effects, we report a sizeable magnetic anisotropy in single crystals of
EuRh2Si2. We observed a surprisingly complex magnetic behavior with three
succesive phase transitions. The Eu2+ moments order in a likely
amplitude-modulated structure below 24.5K, undergoing a further transition to a
structure that is possibly of the equal moment type, and a first order
transition at lower temperatures, presumably into a spin spiral structure. The
sharp metamagnetic transition observed at low fields applied perpendicular to
the hard axis is consistent with a change from a spiral to a fan structure.
These magnetic structures are presumably formed by ferromagnetic planes
perpendicular to the c axis, stacked antiferromagnetically along c but not of
type I, at least just below the ordering temperature. Since EuRh2Si2 is
isoelectronic to EuFe2As2, our results are also relevant for the complex
Eu-magnetism observed there, especially for the transition from an
antiferromagnetic to a ferromagnetic state observed in EuFe2P2 upon
substituting As by P.

and average delay is addressed for a state dependent M/M/1 queueing model, with
controllable queue length dependent service rates and arrival rates. For a
model with a constant arrival rate $\lambda$ for all queue lengths, we obtain
an asymptotic characterization of the minimum average delay, when the average
service cost rate is a small positive quantity, $V$, more than the minimum
average service cost rate required for queue stability. We show that depending
on the value of the arrival rate $\lambda$, the assumed service cost rate
function, and the possible values of the service rates, the minimum average
delay either: a) increases only to a finite value, b) increases without bound
as $\log\frac{1}{V}$, c) increases without bound as $\frac{1}{V}$, or d)
increases without bound as $\frac{1}{\sqrt{V}}$, when $V \downarrow 0$. We then
extend our analysis to (i) a complementary problem, where the tradeoff of
average utility rate and average delay is analysed for a M/M/1 queueing model,
with controllable queue length dependent arrival rates, but a constant service
rate $\mu$ for all queue lengths, and (ii) a M/M/1 queueing model, with
controllable queue length dependent service rates and arrival rates, for which
we obtain an asymptotic characterization of the minimum average delay under
constraints on both the average service cost rate as well as the average
utility rate. The results that we obtain are useful in obtaining intuition as
well guidance for the derivation of similar asymptotic lower bounds, such as
the Berry-Gallager asymptotic lower bound, for discrete time queueing models.

addition, we provide an application of the R\""omelsberger index, in the form of
a constraint on the RG flow of supersymmetric theories. The constraint, which
applies for asymptotically free theories with unbroken supersymmetry and
non-anomalous R-symmetry, is the following: if the R-charges of the chiral
multiplets in the UV theory are 0<q_i<2 and the IR theory can be described as a
free theory of chiral bound states, then the R-charges of these bound states,
~q_j, are constrained such that 0<~q_j<2. We thus provide a proof of a weak

the different statistical maps.
  Evidence for scars at the quantum regime is provided. The validity of the
Selberg trace formula at the classical level and in the quantum regime enforces
the validity of the semiclassical descriptions of these systems, thus offering
further elements for the comparison of quantum-gravity effects and the present

take a variety of shapes when they are ripe. Buckled and wrinkled fruits and
vegetables are often observed. This work aims at establishing the geometrical
constraint for buckled and wrinkled shapes based on a mechanical model. The
mismatch of expansion rate between the exocarp and sarcocarp can produce a
compressive stress on the exocarp. We model a fruit/vegetable with exocarp and
sarcocarp as a hyperelastic layer-substrate structure subjected to uniaxial
compression. The derived bifurcation condition contains both geometrical and
material constants. However, a careful analysis on this condition leads to the
finding of a critical thickness ratio which separates the buckling and
wrinkling modes, and remarkably, which is independent of the material
stiffnesses. More specifically, it is found that if the thickness ratio is
smaller than this critical value a fruit/vegetable should be in a buckling mode
(under a sufficient stress); if a fruit/vegetable in a wrinkled shape the
thickness ratio is always larger than this critical value. To verify the
theoretical prediction, we consider four types of buckled fruits/vegetables and
four types of wrinkled fruits/vegetables with three samples in each type. The
geometrical parameters for the 24 samples are measured and it is found that
indeed all the data fall into the theoretically predicted buckling or wrinkling
domains. Some practical applications based on this critical thickness ratio are
briefly discussed.

research like astronomy rarely contributes directly with tangible outcomes on a
short time scale, the pursuit of this research requires cutting-edge technology
and methods that can on a longer time scale, through their broader application
make a difference. A wealth of examples show how the study of astronomy
contributes to technology, economy and society by constantly pushing for
instruments, processes and software that are beyond our current capabilities.
In this essay we outline both the tangible and intangible reasons that
astronomy is an important part of society. Although we have focused mainly on
the technology and knowledge transfer, perhaps the most important contribution
is still the fact that astronomy makes us aware of how we fit into the vast
Universe.

or mixed) Gaussian states to be equivalent under Gaussian local unitary
operations. To do so, we introduce a standard form for Gaussian states, which
has the properties that (i) every state can be transformed into its standard
form via Gaussian local unitaries and (ii) it is unique and (iii) it can be
easily computed. Thus, two states are equivalent under Gaussian local unitaries
iff their standard form coincides. We explicitly derive the standard form for
two-- and three--mode Gaussian pure states. We then investigate transformations
between these classes by means of Gaussian local operations assisted by
classical communication. For three-mode pure states, we identify a global
property that cannot be created but only destroyed by local operations. This
implies that the highly entangled family of symmetric three--mode Gaussian
states is not sufficient to generated all three-mode Gaussian states by local
Gaussian operations.

linear model with non-Gaussian noise. In the Gaussian case, dimensionality
reduction via a linear matched filter provides a simple low dimensional
sufficient statistic which can be easily communicated and/or stored for future
inference. Such a statistic is usually unknown in the general non-Gaussian
case. Instead, we propose a hybrid matched filter coupled with a randomized
compressed sensing procedure, which together create a low dimensional
statistic. We also derive a complementary algorithm for robust reconstruction
given this statistic. Our recovery method is based on the fast iterative
shrinkage and thresholding algorithm which is used for outlier rejection given
the compressed data. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed framework

standard for information exchange in the Web today is XML. The SW and XML
worlds and their developed infrastructures are based on different data models,

mechanisms that allow the Web of Data users to access XML datasets, using
SPARQL, from their own working environments. It is unrealistic to expect that
all the existing legacy data (e.g., Relational, XML, etc.) will be transformed
into SW data. Therefore, publishing legacy data as Linked Data and providing
SPARQL endpoints over them has become a major research challenge. In this
direction, we introduce the SPARQL2XQuery Framework which creates an
interoperable environment, where SPARQL queries are automatically translated to
XQuery queries, in order to access XML data across the Web. The SPARQL2XQuery
Framework provides a mapping model for the expression of OWL-RDF/S to XML
Schema mappings as well as a method for SPARQL to XQuery translation. To this
end, our Framework supports both manual and automatic mapping specification
between ontologies and XML Schemas. In the automatic mapping specification
scenario, the SPARQL2XQuery exploits the XS2OWL component which transforms XML
Schemas into OWL ontologies. Finally, extensive experiments have been conducted
in order to evaluate the schema transformation, mapping generation, query
translation and query evaluation efficiency, using both real and synthetic

other axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with choice (ZFC). This raises the
question of whether an intuitive justification exists for CH as an additional
axiom, or conversely whether it is more intuitive to deny CH. Freiling's Axiom
of Symmetry (AS) is one candidate for an intuitively justifiable axiom that,
when appended to ZFC, is equivalent to the denial of CH. The intuition relies
on a probabalistic argument, usually cast in terms of throwing random darts at
the real line, and has been defended by researchers as well as popular writers.
In this note, the intuitive argument is reviewed. Following William Abram, it
is suggested that while accepting CH leads directly to a counterexample to AS,
this is not necessarily fatal to our intuition. Instead, we suggest, it serves
to alert us to the error in a naive intuition that leaps too readily from the
near-certainty of individual events to near-certainty of a joint event.

Lempel-Ziv complexity, contrary to common belief. We discuss that, for a finite
length, maximum Lempel-Ziv sequences can be built from a well defined
generating algorithm, which makes them of low Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity,
quite the opposite to randomness. It will be discussed that Lempel-Ziv measure
is, in this sense, less general than Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity, as it can
be fooled by an intelligent enough agent. The latter will be shown to be the
case for the binary expansion of certain irrational numbers. Maximum Lempel-Ziv
sequences induce a normalization that gives good estimates of entropy rate for
several sources, while keeping bounded values for all sequence length, making
it an alternative to other normalization schemes in use.

significant porosity in the smallest objects. If such porosity does occur,
measured densities should begin to increase at the size at which significant
porosity is no longer supported. Among the asteroids, this transition occurs
for diameters larger than ~350 km. In the Kuiper belt, no density measurements
have been made between ~350 km and ~850 km, the diameter range where porosities
might first begin to drop. Objects in this range could provide key tests of the
rock fraction of small Kuiper belt objects. Here we report the orbital
characterization, mass, and density determination of the 2002 UX25 system in
the Kuiper belt. For this object, with a diameter of ~650 km, we find a density
of 0.82+/-0.11 g cm-3, making it the largest solid known object in the solar

porosity of this object is unlikely to be above ~20%, suggesting a low rock
fraction. If the currently measured densities of Kuiper belt objects are a fair
representation of the sample as a whole, creating ~1000 km and larger Kuiper

low-energy modes (including the Majorana and near-zero-energy modes) at the
ends of this system are similar to those in the Majorana nanowire. However,
very distinct from the nanowire, one Majorana mode emerges at the intersection
of the $T$-shaped structure when the number of the low-energy modes at each end
$N$ is odd, whereas neither Majorana nor near-zero-energy mode appears at the
intersection for even $N$. We also discover that the intersection Majorana mode
plays an important role in the transport through the above $T$-shaped
nanostructure with each end connected with a normal lead. Due to the presence
of the intersection mode, the deviation of the zero-bias conductance from the
ideal value in the long-arm limit $Ne^2/h$ is more pronounced in the regime of
odd $N$ compared to the one of even $N$. Furthermore, when the magnetic field
increases from the regime of odd $N$ to the one of even $N+1$, the deviation
from the ideal value tends to decrease. This behavior is also very distinct

(SHE) of a Gaussian beam reflected from the interface between air and
topological insulators (TIs). The photonic SHE is attributed to spin-orbit
coupling and manifests itself as in-plane and transverse spin-dependent
splitting. We reveal that the spin-orbit coupling effect in TIs can be routed
by adjusting the axion angle variations. Unlike the transverse spin-dependent
splitting, we find that the in-plane one is sensitive to the axion angle. It is
shown that the polarization structure in magneto-optical Kerr effect is
significantly altered due to the spin-dependent splitting in photonic SHE. We
theoretically propose a weak measurement method to determine the strength of
axion coupling by probing the in-plane splitting of photonic SHE.

massive star-forming clump in the molecular cloud G35.2-0.74, using
Submillimeter Array observations of polarized dust emission. Thanks to the
sensitive and high-angular-resolution observations, we are able to resolve the
morphology of the B field in the plane of sky and detect a great turn of 90
degree in the B field direction: Over the northern part of the clump, where a
velocity gradient is evident, the B field is largely aligned with the long axis
of the clump, whereas in the southern part, where the velocity field appears
relatively uniform, the B field is slightly pinched with its mean direction
perpendicular to the clump elongation. We suggest that the clump forms as its
parent cloud collapses more along the large scale B field. In this process, the
northern part carries over most of the angular momentum, forming a fast
rotating system, and pulls the B field into a toroidal configuration. In
contrast, the southern part is not significantly rotating and the B field
remains in a poloidal configuration. A statistical analysis of the observed
polarization dispersion yields a B field strength of ~ 1 mG, a
turbulent-to-magnetic energy ratio of order unity, and a mass-to-magnetic flux
ratio of ~ 2--3 in units of the critical value. Detailed calculations support
our hypothesis that the B field in the northern part is being rotationally
distorted. Our observations, in conjunction with early single-dish data,
suggest that the B field may play a critical role in the formation of the dense
clump, whereas rotation and turbulence could also be important in further
dynamical evolution of the clump. The observations also provide evidence for a
wide-angle outflow driven from a strongly rotating region whose B field is
largely toroidal.

instrumentation at astronomical observatories, which include smaller
footprints, less mechanical and thermal instabilities and high levels of
performance. To realize such instrumentation it is imperative to convert the
atmospheric seeing-limited signal that is captured by the telescope into a
diffraction-limited signal. This process can be achieved photonically by using
a mode reformatting device known as a photonic lantern that performs a
multimode to single-mode transition. With the aim of developing an optimized
integrated photonic lantern, we undertook a systematic parameter scan of
devices fabricated by the femtosecond laser direct-write technique. The devices
were designed for operation around 1.55 {\mu}m. The devices showed (coupling
and transition) losses of less than 5% for F/# $\geq$ 12 injection and the
total device throughput (including substrate absorption) as high as 75-80%.
Such devices show great promise for future use in astronomy.

evolution. Here we examine the properties of 48 post-starburst galaxies in
Cl1604, comparing them to other galaxy populations in the same supercluster.
Incorporating photometry from ground-based optical and near-infrared imaging,
along with $Spitzer$ mid-infrared observations, we derive stellar masses for
all Cl1604 members. The colors and stellar masses of the K+A galaxies support
the idea that they are progenitors of red sequence galaxies. Their
morphologies, residual star-formation rates, and spatial distributions suggest
galaxy mergers may be the principal mechanism producing post-starburst
galaxies. Interaction between galaxies and the dense intra-cluster medium is
also effective, but only in the cores of dynamically evolved clusters. The
prevalence of post-starburst galaxies in clusters correlates with the dynamical
state of the host cluster, as both galaxy mergers and the dense intra-cluster
medium produce post-starburst galaxies. We also investigate the incompleteness
and contamination of K+A samples selected by means of H$\delta$ and [OII]
equivalent widths. K+A samples may be up to $\sim50\%$ incomplete due to the
presence of LINER/Seyferts and up to $\sim30\%$ of K+A galaxies could have

The pulsar is in a binary orbit about its approximately $20~M_{\odot}$

pulse-number ambiguities that have plagued previous attempts to model the
binary orbit. We measure significant first and second time derivatives of the
projected semimajor axis and longitude of the periastron of the orbit. These
variations are found to be consistent with the precession of the orbital plane
due to classical spin-orbit coupling. The derived moment of inertia and spin of
the companion are consistent with the companion rotating at near-breakup
velocity. The system configuration is also consistent with the geometry derived
from both the polarisation of the radio emission and the eclipse of the pulsar
by the equatorial disc of the companion. We find strong evidence for orbital
period decay that can be attributed to mass loss from the companion star. We
also measure a significant proper motion that locates the birth of the system
in the Centaurus OB1 association. By combining proper motion of the pulsar with
radial velocity measurements of the companion, we measure the three-dimensional
velocity of the system. This velocity is used to constrain the masses of the
stars prior to the supernova explosion and the kick the pulsar received at or
immediately after the explosion.

that hold independent of the details of the emission mechanism show there is an
inconsistency in the claim that such a blackhole evaporates away in a finite
time. In essence: because the external domain is static, there is an infinite
time available for the process to take place, so whenever the evaporation
process is claimed to come to completion, it should have happened earlier. The
problem is identified to lie in the claim that the locus of emission of Hawking
radiation lies just outside the globally defined event horizon. Rather, the
emission domain must be mainly located inside the event horizon, so most of the
Hawking radiation ends up at this singularity rather than at infinity and the
black hole never evaporates away. This result supports a previous claim

Optimization (q-GSQPO) algorithm to determine the global minimum of the
potential energy function. Swarm Quantum-like Particle Optimization (SQPO)
algorithms have been derived using different attractive potential fields to
represent swarm particles moving in a quantum environment, where the one which
uses a harmonic oscillator potential as attractive field is considered as an
improved version. In this paper, we propose a new SQPO that uses -Gaussian
probability density function for the attractive potential field (q-GSQPO)
rather than Gaussian one (GSQPO) which corresponds to harmonic potential. The
performance of the q-GSQPO is compared against the GSQPO. The new algorithm
outperforms the GSQPO on most of the time in convergence to the global optimum
by increasing the efficiency of sampling the phase space and avoiding the
premature convergence to local minima. Moreover, the computational efforts were
comparable for both algorithms. We tested the algorithm to determine the lowest
energy configurations of a particle moving in a 2, 5, 10, and 50 dimensional

sensory neurons can be reproduced by optimizing coding efficiency of natural
stimulus ensembles. A still unresolved question is whether the efficient coding
hypothesis explains formation of neurons which explicitly represent
environmental features of different functional importance. This paper proposes
that the spatial selectivity of higher auditory neurons emerges as a direct
consequence of learning efficient codes for natural binaural sounds. Firstly,
it is demonstrated that a linear efficient coding transform - Independent
Component Analysis (ICA) trained on spectrograms of naturalistic simulated
binaural sounds extracts spatial information present in the signal. A simple
hierarchical ICA extension allowing for decoding of sound position is proposed.
Furthermore, it is shown that units revealing spatial selectivity can be
learned from a binaural recording of a natural auditory scene. In both cases a
relatively small subpopulation of learned spectrogram features suffices to
perform accurate sound localization. Representation of the auditory space is
therefore learned in a purely unsupervised way by maximizing the coding
efficiency and without any task-specific constraints. This results imply that
efficient coding is a useful strategy for learning structures which allow for
making behaviorally vital inferences about the environment.

electrons around the vacancy should antiferromagnetically couple to the local
moment and carry non-vanishing moments. Here we propose that a phase possessing
both significant out-of-plane displacements and $\pi$ bands with
antiferromagnetic coupling to the localized $\sigma$ moment is the ground
state. With the features we provide, it is possible for spin-resolved STM, STS,

  Theory, Series A",,,,"math.CO math.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Let A = (A,V) be a complex hyperplane arrangement and let L(A) denote its
intersection lattice. The arrangement A is called supersolvable, provided its
lattice L(A) is supersolvable. For X in L(A), it is known that the restriction
A^X is supersolvable provided A is.
  Suppose that W is a finite, unitary reflection group acting on the complex
vector space V. Let A(W) = (A(W), V) be its associated hyperplane arrangement.
In earlier work by the last two authors, we classified all supersolvable
reflection arrangements. Extending this work, the aim of this note is to
determine all supersolvable restrictions of reflection arrangements. It turns
out that apart from the obvious restrictions of supersolvable reflection
arrangements there are only a few additional instances. Moreover, in our
previous work, we classified all inductively free restrictions A(W)^X of
reflection arrangements A(W). Since every supersolvable arrangement is
inductively free, the supersolvable restrictions A(W)^X of reflection
arrangements A(W) form a natural subclass of the class of inductively free
restrictions A(W)^X.
  Finally, we characterize the irreducible supersolvable restrictions of
reflection arrangements by the presence of modular elements of dimension 1 in
their intersection lattice. This in turn shows that reflection arrangements as
well as their restrictions are of fiber type if and only if they are strictly
linearly fibered.

several nontrivial examples of NDMC which satisfy the $\frak{D}_1$-condition

They are
needed to characterise the performance of instruments and are paramount for
photometric calibration. During the Herschel Calibration Asteroid Preparatory
Programme approximately 50 asteroids have been established as far-IR/sub-mm/mm
calibrators for Herschel. The selected asteroids fill the flux gap between the
sub-mm/mm calibrators Mars, Uranus and Neptune, and the mid-IR bright
calibration stars. All three Herschel instruments observed asteroids for
various calibration purposes, including pointing tests, absolute flux
calibration, relative spectral response function, observing mode validation,
and cross-calibration aspects. Here we present newly established models for the
four large and well characterized main-belt asteroids (1) Ceres, (2) Pallas,
(4) Vesta, and (21) Lutetia which can be considered as new prime flux
calibrators. The relevant object-specific properties (size, shape,
spin-properties, albedo, thermal properties) are well established. The seasonal
(distance to Sun, distance to observer, phase angle, aspect angle) and daily
variations (rotation) are included in a new thermophysical model setup for
these targets. The thermophysical model predictions agree within 5% with the
available (and independently calibrated) Herschel measurements. The four
objects cover the flux regime from just below 1,000 Jy (Ceres at mid-IR
N-/Q-band) down to fluxes below 0.1 Jy (Lutetia at the longest wavelengths).
Based on the comparison with PACS, SPIRE and HIFI measurements and pre-Herschel
experience, the validity of these new prime calibrators ranges from
mid-infrared to about 700 micron, connecting nicely the absolute stellar
reference system in the mid-IR with the planet-based calibration at sub-mm/mm
wavelengths.

systems have stimulated intensive studies of the possible manifestation of such
a condensation in Fermi systems. In many Fermi systems and compounds at zero
temperature a phase transition happens that leads to a quite specific state
called fermion condensation. As a signal of such a fermion condensation quantum
phase transition (FCQPT) serves unlimited increase of the effective mass of
quasiparticles that determines the excitation spectrum and creates flat bands.
We show that the class of Fermi liquids with the fermion condensate forms a new
state of matter. We discuss the phase diagrams and the physical properties of
systems located near that phase transition. It is demonstrated that a huge
amount of experimental data collected on different compounds suggests that
they, starting from some temperature and down, form the new state of matter,
and are governed by the fermion condensation. Our discussion shows that the
theory of fermion condensation develops completely good description of the NFL
behavior of strongly correlated Fermi systems. Moreover, the fermion
condensation can be considered as the universal reason for the NFL behavior
observed in various HF metals, liquids, compounds with quantum spin liquids,
and quasicrystals. We show that these systems exhibit universal scaling
behavior of their thermodynamic properties. Therefore, the quantum critical
physics of different strongly correlated compounds is universal, and emerges
regardless of the underlying microscopic details of the compounds. This uniform
behavior, governed by the universal quantum critical physics, allows us to view
it as the main characteristic of the new state of matter.

languages generated by such formalisms are constrained by the constant-growth

like tree-adjoining grammars or multiple context-free grammars, generate
languages which verify the stronger property of being semilinear. In (Bourreau

mildly context-sensitive classes of languages which are not semilinear,

extend the notion of semilinearity, and characterise the Parikh image of the
IO-MCFLs (i.e. languages which belong to the closure of MCFLs under
IO-subsitution) as universally-linear. Based on this result and on the work of

parameters $R$ of $0.2$ and $0.3$ in pseudo-rapidity $|\eta|<0.5$. The
transverse momentum $p_{\rm T}$ of charged particles is measured down to $0.15$
GeV/$c$ which gives access to the low $p_{\rm T}$ fragments of the jet. Jets
found in heavy-ion collisions are corrected event-by-event for average
background density and on an inclusive basis (via unfolding) for residual
background fluctuations and detector effects. A strong suppression of jet
production in central events with respect to peripheral events is observed. The
suppression is found to be similar to the suppression of charged hadrons, which
suggests that substantial energy is radiated at angles larger than the jet
resolution parameter $R=0.3$ considered in the analysis. The fragmentation bias
introduced by selecting jets with a high $p_{\rm T}$ leading particle, which
rejects jets with a soft fragmentation pattern, has a similar effect on the jet
yield for central and peripheral events. The ratio of jet spectra with $R=0.2$
and $R=0.3$ is found to be similar in Pb-Pb and simulated PYTHIA pp events,
indicating no strong broadening of the radial jet structure in the
reconstructed jets with $R<0.3$.

This paves the way for the development of video architectures that acquire
several frames per second. We specifically address the diffraction problem,
showing that deconvolution normally used to recover diffraction blur can be
replaced by convolution of the sensing matrix, and how measurements of a 0/1
physical sensing matrix can be converted to -1/1 compressive sensing matrix
without any extra acquisitions. Simulations of our architecture show that the
image quality is comparable to that of a classic Compressive Imaging camera,
whereas the proposed architecture avoids long acquisition times due to

Radiative rates, oscillator strengths and line strengths are provided for all

most recent calculations reported by Singh {\em et al} [Can J. Phys. {\bf 90}

reconstruction of gene trees based on sequence alignments. Yet, most
phylogeneticists seek to reveal the history of species. Although the histories
of genes and species are tightly linked, they are seldom identical, because
genes duplicate, are lost or horizontally transferred, and because alleles can
co-exist in populations for periods that may span several speciation events.
Building models describing the relationship between gene and species trees can
thus improve the reconstruction of gene trees when a species tree is known, and
vice-versa. Several approaches have been proposed to solve the problem in one
direction or the other, but in general neither gene trees nor species trees are
known. Only a few studies have attempted to jointly infer gene trees and
species trees. In this article we review the various models that have been used
to describe the relationship between gene trees and species trees. These models
account for gene duplication and loss, transfer or incomplete lineage sorting.
Some of them consider several types of events together, but none exists
currently that considers the full repertoire of processes that generate gene
trees along the species tree. Simulations as well as empirical studies on
genomic data show that combining gene tree-species tree models with models of
sequence evolution improves gene tree reconstruction. In turn, these better
gene trees provide a better basis for studying genome evolution or
reconstructing ancestral chromosomes and ancestral gene sequences. We predict
that gene tree-species tree methods that can deal with genomic data sets will
be instrumental to advancing our understanding of genomic evolution.

using the joint or the marginal likelihood, based on independence or
conditional independence assumptions. The same dilemma occurs within the
Bayesian framework with respect to the estimation of the Bayesian marginal (or
integrated) likelihood, which is the main tool for model comparison and
averaging. In most cases, the Bayesian marginal likelihood is a high
dimensional integral that cannot be computed analytically and a plethora of
methods based on Monte Carlo integration (MCI) are used for its estimation. In
this work, it is shown that the joint MCI approach makes subtle use of the
properties of the adopted model, leading to increased error and bias in finite
settings. The sources and the components of the error associated with
estimators under the two approaches are identified here and provided in exact
forms. Additionally, the effect of the sample covariation on the Monte Carlo
estimators is examined. In particular, even under independence assumptions the
sample covariance will be close to (but not exactly) zero which surprisingly
has a severe effect on the estimated values and their variability. To address
this problem, an index of the sample's divergence from independence is
introduced as a multivariate extension of covariance. The implications
addressed here are important in the majority of practical problems appearing in
Bayesian inference of multi-parameter models with analogous structures.

to initiate or sustain social events. Although the use of computer-mediated
communication and social network sites such as Facebook for event promotion is
becoming popular, online participation in an event does not always translate to
offline attendance. In this paper, we report on an interview study of 31
participants that examines how people handle online event invitations and what
influences their online and offline participation. The results show that
people's event participation is shaped by their social perceptions of the
event's nature (e.g., public or private), their relationships to others (e.g.,
the strength of their connections to other invitees), and the medium used to
communicate event information (e.g., targeted invitation via email or spam
communication via Facebook event page). By exploring how people decide whether
to participate online or offline, the results illuminate the sophisticated
nature of the mechanisms that affect participation and have design implications
that can bridge virtual and real attendance.

electrical, magnetic, and chemical properties of truncated graphene structures,

chemical functionalization, leading to unpredictable properties. Here we report
that graphene edges fabricated by electron-beam-initiated mechanical rupture or

either the armchair or zigzag direction. Via aberration-corrected transmission
electron microscopy, we demonstrate reversible and extended pentagon-heptagon

theoretically the dynamics of the transitions between configuration states.
Good theoretical-experimental agreement is found for the flipping rates between
5-7 and 6-6 zigzag edge states. Our study demonstrates that simple ripping is
remarkably effective in producing atomically clean, ideal terminations thus
providing a valuable tool for realizing atomically-tailored graphene and
facilitating meaningful experimental study.

is expected to generate strong magnetic fields. Kinetic energy stored in
differential rotation is partially dissipated in the magnetically dominated
corona, which forms a hot variable outflow with ejection velocity comparable to
$10^9$ cm s$^{-1}$. The outflow should carry significant mass and energy for
hours to days, creating an expanding fireball with the following features. (i)
The fireball is initially opaque and its internal energy is dominated by the
trapped thermal radiation. The stored heat is partially converted to kinetic
energy of the flow (through adiabatic cooling) and partially radiated away.
(ii) Internal shocks develop in the fireball and increase its radiative output.
(iii) A significant fraction of the emitted energy is in the optical band. As a
result, a bright optical transient with luminosity $L\sim 10^{41}-10^{42}$ erg
s$^{-1}$ and a characteristic peak duration comparable to 1 day may be expected
from the merger. In contrast to classical novae or supernovae, the transient
does not involve nuclear energy. The decay after its peak reflects the damping
of differential rotation in the merger remnant. Such outbursts may be detected
in the local Universe with current and upcoming optical surveys.

reaching values comparable to the accretion power even if assuming very strong
Doppler boosting and very high efficiency of gamma-ray production. With much
lower radiative efficiencies of protons than of electrons, and the recent
reports of very strong coupling of electrons with shock-heated protons
indicated by Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations, the leptonic models seem to be
strongly favored over the hadronic ones. However, the electron-proton coupling
combined with the ERC (External-Radiation-Compton) models of gamma-ray
production in leptonic models predict extremely hard X-ray spectra, with energy
indices about 0. This is inconsistent with the observed 2-10 keV slopes of
blazars, which cluster around an index value of 0.6. This problem can be
resolved by assuming that electrons can be cooled down radiatively to
non-relativistic energies, or that blazar spectra are entirely dominated by the
SSC (Synchrotron-Self Compton) component up to at least 10 keV. Here, we show
that the required cooling can be sufficiently efficient only at distances r <
0.03pc. SSC spectra, on the other hand, can be produced roughly co-spatially
with the observed synchrotron and ERC components, which are most likely located
roughly at a parsec scale. We show that the dominant SSC component can also be
produced much further than the dominant synchrotron and ERC components, at
distances larger than 10 parsecs. Hence, depending on the spatial distribution
of the energy dissipation along the jet, one may expect to see
gamma-ray/optical events with either correlated or uncorrelated X-rays. In all
cases the number of electron-positron pairs per proton is predicted to be very
low. The direct verification of the proposed SSC scenario requires sensitive
observations in the hard X-ray band which is now possible with the NuSTAR
satellite.

and $r$), using three of the largest (un-) available frame-transfer CCDs,
namely the 2k x 6k CCD42-C0 from e2v. As these detectors are housed in three
separate cryostats, compact cooling devices are required that offer sufficient
power to cool the large chips to a temperature of 165K. We explored a broad
spectrum of cooling options and technologies to cool the MAIA detectors.
Finally, compact free-piston Stirling coolers were selected, namely the CryoTel
MT cryo-coolers from SUNPOWER, that can extract 5W of heat at a temperature of
77K. In this contribution we give details of the MAIA detector cooling
solution. We also discuss the general usability of this type of closed-cycle
cryo-coolers for astronomical detectors. They offer distinct advantages but the
vibrations caused by mechanical cryo-cooling impose a serious drawback. We
present a solution to mechanically decouple the coolers from the instrument and
show some results of how this reduces the vibrations to a level that is
acceptable for most applications on astronomical telescopes.

nonlinear state space models by combining Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and
particle filtering. The latter is used to estimate the intractable likelihood.
In its original formulation, PMH makes use of a marginal MCMC proposal for the
parameters, typically a Gaussian random walk. However, this can lead to a poor
exploration of the parameter space and an inefficient use of the generated
particles.
  We propose a number of alternative versions of PMH that incorporate gradient
and Hessian information about the posterior into the proposal. This information
is more or less obtained as a byproduct of the likelihood estimation. Indeed,
we show how to estimate the required information using a fixed-lag particle
smoother, with a computational cost growing linearly in the number of
particles. We conclude that the proposed methods can: (i) decrease the length
of the burn-in phase, (ii) increase the mixing of the Markov chain at the
stationary phase, and (iii) make the proposal distribution scale invariant
which simplifies tuning.

phenomenological criterion of band inversion is formulated for both bulk and

calculated bandstructures of slabs with varying thickness, where surface states
are identified using a quantitative criterion according to their spatial
distribution. The thickness-dependent energy gap, attributed to inter-surface
interaction, and the emergence of gapless surface states for slabs above a
critical thickness are investigated. We map out the transition to the
infinite-thickness limit by calculating explicitly the modifications in the
spatial distribution and spin-character of the surface states wavefunction with
increasing the slab thickness. Our numerical analysis shows that the system
must be approximately forty quintuple-layers thick to exhibit completely
decoupled surface states, localized on the opposite surfaces. These results

possible to increase the critical temperature above the bulk limit by tuning
the film thickness or lateral size.

on the optimization or modelling of RNNs, mostly motivated by adressing the
problems of the vanishing and exploding gradients. The control of overfitting
has seen considerably less attention. This paper contributes to that by
analyzing fast dropout, a recent regularization method for generalized linear
models and neural networks from a back-propagation inspired perspective. We
show that fast dropout implements a quadratic form of an adaptive,
per-parameter regularizer, which rewards large weights in the light of
underfitting, penalizes them for overconfident predictions and vanishes at
minima of an unregularized training loss. The derivatives of that regularizer
are exclusively based on the training error signal. One consequence of this is
the absense of a global weight attractor, which is particularly appealing for
RNNs, since the dynamics are not biased towards a certain regime. We positively
test the hypothesis that this improves the performance of RNNs on four musical
data sets.

nuclei (AGN) luminosity (and, therefore, the black hole accretion rate) of
Seyfert galaxies. This suggests a physical connection between the gas forming
stars on kpc scales and the gas on sub-pc scales that is feeding the black
hole. We compiled the largest sample of Seyfert galaxies to date with high
angular resolution (0.4-0.8 arcsec) mid-infrared (8-13 micron) spectroscopy.
The sample includes 29 Seyfert galaxies drawn from the AGN Revised Shapley-Ames
catalogue. At a median distance of 33 Mpc, our data allow us to probe nuclear
regions on scales of 65 pc (median value). We found no general evidence of
suppression of the 11.3 micron polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission
in the vicinity of these AGN, and used this feature as a proxy for the SFR. We
detected the 11.3 micron PAH feature in the nuclear spectra of 45% of our
sample. The derived nuclear SFRs are, on average, five times lower than those
measured in circumnuclear regions of 600 pc in size (median value). However,
the projected nuclear SFR densities are a factor of 20 higher than those
measured on circumnuclear scales. This indicates that the SF activity per unit
area in the central 65 pc of Seyfert galaxies is much higher than at larger
distances from their nuclei. We studied the connection between the nuclear SFR
and the black hole accretion rate and showed that numerical simulations
reproduce fairly well our observed relation.

problem is the choice of the grid that discretizes the transfer medium. Many
modern radiative transfer codes, whether using Monte Carlo or ray tracing
techniques, are equipped with hierarchical octree-based grids to accommodate a
wide dynamic range in densities. We critically investigate two different
aspects of octree grids in the framework of Monte Carlo dust radiative
transfer. Inspired by their common use in computer graphics applications, we
test hierarchical k-d tree grids as an alternative for octree grids. On the
other hand, we investigate which node subdivision-stopping criteria are optimal
for constructing of hierarchical grids. We implemented a k-d tree grid in the
3D radiative transfer code SKIRT and compared it with the previously
implemented octree grid. We also considered three different node
subdivision-stopping criteria (based on mass, optical depth, and density
gradient thresholds). Based on a small suite of test models, we compared the
efficiency and accuracy of the different grids, according to various quality
metrics. For a given set of requirements, the k-d tree grids only require half
the number of cells of the corresponding octree. Moreover, for the same number
of grid cells, the k-d tree is characterized by higher discretization accuracy.
Concerning the subdivision stopping criteria, we find that an optical depth
criterion is not a useful alternative to the more standard mass threshold,
since the resulting grids show a poor accuracy. Both criteria can be combined;
however, in the optimal combination, for which we provide a simple approximate
recipe, this can lead to a 20% reduction in the number of cells needed to reach
a certain grid quality. An additional density gradient threshold criterion can
be added that solves the problem of poorly resolving sharp edges and...

the iPhones and Android phones were released. More and more mobile phones with
large touchscreen have been produced, however, the phones with small size
displays are still in the majority of touch phones. The foremost interface on
touch smartphones is the information input module using soft keyboards.
Traditional input methods on touch phones have either too small key buttons
(such as QWERTY) or too many functions (such as 3$\times$4 keyboard), which are
inconvenient to use. Moreover, the conventional soft keyboards only use tapping
to input texts while current touch smartphones allow various gestures on the
touchscreen, such as sliding. In this paper, a novel soft keyboard called QWERT
is proposed for touchscreen-based smartphones. The users can interact with
phones via finger gestures of tapping or sliding when input text by using the
QWERT. In doing so, the interactions between users and smartphones will be
faster and easier. An experiment carried out on inexperienced human subjects
shows that they can learn very fast due to their familiarities with QWERTY. A
simulation experiment based on a cognitive architecture, ACT-R, was also
conducted to predict the movement time (MT) of experienced human subjects. The
simulation results show that the MT using QWERT outperforms other default
keyboards. These outcomes imply that the novel QWERT is a viable option for
touch smartphone users. Based on the novel design, an application is released
on Android systems. This application is expected to give better user experience
for customers who use touch smartphones.

tool to model simultaneously the validity of, and knowledge about, sentences in
an appropriate language. In particular, certain bilattices have been used to
model situations in which information is prioritised and so can be viewed
hierarchically. These default bilattices are not interlaced: the lattice
operations of one lattice structure do not preserve the order of the other one.
The well-known product representation theorem for interlaced bilattices does
not extend to bilattices which fail to be interlaced and the lack of a product
representation has been a handicap to understanding the structure of default
bilattices. In this paper we study, from an algebraic perspective, a hierarchy
of varieties of default bilattices, allowing for different levels of default.
We develop natural dualities for these varieties and thereby obtain a concrete
representation for the algebras in each variety. This leads on to a form of
product representation that generalises the product representation as this
applies to distributive bilattices.

Monte Carlo (MC) simulations generated assuming the $\Lambda$CDM best-fit power

(NEQ) in the Planck data. Asymmetries between the SEQ and the other three
quadrants (southwestern quadrant (SWQ), northwestern quadrant (NWQ), and NEQ)
are each in disagreement with an isotropic sky at a 95\% confidence level.
Furthermore, by rotating the Planck temperature sky map with respect to z
direction, we showed the rotation angle where the TPCF of the SEQ has its
maximal power. Our analysis of the Planck foreground-cleaned maps shows that
there is an excess of power in the TPCF in the SEQ and a significant lack of

to gravity are a promising route to obtain clues on the origin of cosmic
acceleration. We study here the robustness of these tests to the presence of DE
density, velocity, and anisotropic stress perturbations. We find that the
dispersion in the growth index parameter remains small enough to distinguish
between extreme cases of DE models and some commonly used modified gravity
models. The sign of the slope parameter for a redshift dependent growth index
was found to be inconsistent as an additional test in extreme cases of DE
models with perturbations. Next, we studied the effect of DE perturbations on
the modified growth (MG) parameters that enter the perturbed Einstein
equations. We find that while the dark energy perturbations affect the MG
parameters, the deviations remain smaller than those due to modified gravity
models. Additionally, the deviations due to DE perturbations with a non-zero
effective sound speed occur at scale ranges that are completely different than
those due to some modified gravity models such as the $f(R)$ models. In the
case of modified gravity models with zero anisotropic stress at late times, the
simultaneous determination of the effective dark energy equation of state and
the MG parameters can provide the distinction between these models and DE. The
growth index test was found to be the most robust to these perturbations. The
scale dependence of the MG parameters in some cases of modified gravity
constitute a clear-cut discriminant regardless of any DE perturbations. In
summary, we find that the currently proposed cosmological tests to distinguish
between DE and modified gravity are robust to DE perturbations even for extreme
cases. This is certainly the case even for DE models with equations of state of
DE that fall well outside of current cosmological constraints.

data flow analysis, to decide to parallelize or not to parallelize our

techniques and tools used to analyze sequential programs also be used to
analyze parallel ones written in MPI?"". In this paper we'll try to answer this

(z=0.184), luminous ($L_{bol} \sim 10^{47}$ erg s$^{-1}$) type I quasar,
PDS456. A new 125ks Suzaku observation in 2011 caught the quasar during a
period of low X-ray flux and with a hard X-ray spectrum, in contrast to a
previous 190ks Suzaku observation in 2007 when the quasar appeared brighter and
had a steep ($\Gamma>2$) X-ray spectrum. The 2011 X-ray spectrum contains a
pronounced trough near 9\,keV in the quasar rest frame, which can be modeled
with blue-shifted iron K-shell absorption, most likely from the He and H-like
transitions of iron. The absorption trough is observed at a similar rest-frame
energy as in the earlier 2007 observation, which appears to confirm the
existence of a persistent high velocity wind in PDS 456, at an outflow velocity
of $0.25-0.30$c. The spectral variability between 2007 and 2011 can be
accounted for by variations in a partial covering absorber, increasing in
covering fraction from the brighter 2007 observation to the hard and faint 2011
observation. Overall the low flux 2011 observation can be explained if PDS 456
is observed at relatively low inclination angles through a Compton thick wind,
originating from the accretion disk, which significantly attenuates the X-ray
flux from the quasar.

  Explicit guidelines to design optimal and nearly optimal schemes operating

of the HT subspace containing the covariance matrix of the uncompressed

both of these quantities independently tend to align with the strongest

almost perfect alignment with the strongest stretching direction. The alignment

stellar surface for a MSP is assumed and such a field will be close to the
surface magnetic fields ($\sim 10^{11}- 10^{12}$ G) of young ulsars; the outer
gap of a MSP is controlled by photon-photon pair production process, where the
effects of magnetic inclination angle ($\alpha$) and magnetic geometry have
been taken into account, therefore the fractional size of the outer gap is a
function of not only pulsar's period and magnetic field strength but also
magnetic inclination angle and radial distance to the neutron star, the inner
boundary of the outer gap can be estimated by the pair production process of
the gamma-ray photons which are produced by the back-flowing particles through
the null charge surface; inside the outer gap, a Gaussian distribution of the
parallel electric field along the trans-field thickness is assumed, and the
gamma-ray emission is represented by the emission from the average radial
distance along the central field lines of the outer gap. Using this model, the
phase-averaged gamma-ray spectra are calculated and compared with the observed
spectra of 37 MSPs given by the second {\it Fermi}-LAT catalog of gamma-ray

with user satisfaction. Therefore, analysts, designers and developers focused
more on achieving all its functionality, without considering others kinds of
requirement such as dependability s aspects. Moreover, these latter are often
considered as properties of the system that will must be checked and corrected
once the project is completed. The practice of ""fix it later"" can cause the
obsolescence of the entire Data Warehouse System. Therefore, it requires the
adoption of a methodology that will ensure the integration of aspects of
dependability since the early stages of project DWS. In this paper, we first
define the concepts related to dependability of DWS. Then we present our
approach inspired from the MDA (Model Driven Architecture) approach to model
dependability s aspects namely: availability, reliability, maintainability and
security, taking into account their interaction.

final states in a very short time. We estimate how far at most these two final
states can travel away from each other in the half-life of the initial unstable
hadron. As examples, this distance is about 2.5 fm for rho -> pi pi, 1.8 fm for
Delta -> N pi, and 0.6 fm for f_0(500) -> pi pi. We calculate this distance for
altogether 181 hadrons, among all the 324 ones listed in PDG2012 together with
Zc(3900) and Zc(4025). We find it is around one femtometer for many hadrons,
which is of the same order of magnitude as the hadronic radii. We also estimate
this distance for altogether 15 unstable nuclei. We find it is about several
femtometers for some of them, which is of the same order of magnitude as the
nuclear radii. For example, it is about six femtometers for O12 -> N11 p.

multiple sources. A personal web as part of information resources in the
Internet requires a feature that can be understood by computer machines.
Therefore, in this paper an ontology semantic web approach is used to map the
resources in a meaningful scheme. In the design of concept, resources on the
web are viewed as documents that have some property and ownership. Domain
interest or web scope is used to describe a classification of resources that
navigate into relevant documents. If instances are completed to the concept,
then the ontology file can be loaded and shared as annotation on personal web.
This allows computer machine to query multiple ontology from different personal
webs that use it.

type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF).
We determine star-formation rates, gas-phase/stellar metallicities, and stellar
masses and ages of these objects. As expected, strong correlations between the
SN Ia light-curve width (stretch) and the host age/mass/metallicity are found:
fainter, faster-declining events tend to be hosted by older/massive/metal-rich
galaxies. There is some evidence that redder SNe Ia explode in higher
metallicity galaxies, but we found no relation between the SN colour and host
galaxy extinction based on the Balmer decrement, suggesting that the colour
variation of these SNe does not primarily arise from this source. SNe Ia in
higher-mass/metallicity galaxies also appear brighter after stretch/colour
corrections than their counterparts in lower mass hosts, and the stronger
correlation is with gas-phase metallicity suggesting this may be the more
important variable. We also compared the host stellar mass distribution to that
in galaxy targeted SN surveys and the high-redshift untargeted Supernova Legacy
Survey (SNLS). SNLS has many more low mass galaxies, while the targeted
searches have fewer. This can be explained by an evolution in the galaxy
stellar mass function, coupled with a SN delay-time distribution proportional
to $t^{-1}$. Finally, we found no significant difference in the
mass--metallicity relation of our SN Ia hosts compared to field galaxies,
suggesting any metallicity effect on the SN Ia rate is small.

to remove the contribution of ""warm"" emission to this channel. Comparing with
simultaneous observations from EIS/Hinode, we find that the variability
observed in Fe XVIII is strongly correlated with the emission from lines formed
at similar temperatures. We examine the evolution of loops in the cores of
active regions at various stages of evolution. Using a newly developed event
detection algorithm we characterize the distribution of event frequency,
duration, and magnitude in these active regions. These distributions are
similar for regions of similar age and show a consistent pattern as the regions
age. This suggests that these characteristics are important constraints for
models of solar active regions. We find that the typical frequency of the
intensity fluctuations is about 1400s for any given line-of-sight, i.e. about
2-3 events per hour. Using the EBTEL 0D hydrodynamic model, however, we show
that this only sets a lower limit on the heating frequency along that

the anomalous viscosity of the quark-gluon plasma for nonequilibrium. For

non-rotating, shallow-water dynamics in one dimension with astronomical forcing
and allows for arbitrary topography. Using a natural modal separation, both
large scale (barotropic) and small scale (baroclinic) components of the surface
tidal elevation are shown to be comparably affected by stratification. It is
also shown that the topography and basin boundaries affect the sensitivity of
the barotropic surface tide to stratification significantly. This paper,
therefore, provides a framework to understand how the presence of
stratification impacts barotropic as well as baroclinic tides, and how climatic
perturbations to oceanic stratification contribute to secular variations in
tides. Results from a realistic-domain global numerical two-layer tide model
are briefly examined and found to be qualitatively consistent with the

velocity distribution of a stellar system, artificially inflating the measured
line-of-sight velocity dispersion, which can in turn lead to erroneous
conclusions about the dynamical state of the system. Cottaar et al. (2012b)
proposed a maximum likelihood procedure to recover the intrinsic velocity
dispersion of a resolved star cluster from a single epoch of radial velocity
data of individual stars, which they achieved by simultaneously fitting the
intrinsic velocity distribution of the single stars and the centres of mass of
the binaries along with the velocity shifts caused by binary orbital motions.
Assuming well-characterized binary properties, they showed that this procedure
can accurately reproduce intrinsic velocity dispersions below 1 km s$^{-1}$ for
solar-type stars. Here we investigate the systematic offsets induced in cases
where the binary properties are uncertain, and we show how two epochs of radial
velocity data with an appropriate baseline can help to mitigate these
systematic effects. We first test the method above using Monte Carlo
simulations, taking into account the large uncertainties in the binary
properties of OB stars. We then apply it to radial velocity data in the young
massive cluster R136, an example for which the intrinsic velocity dispersion of
O-type stars is known from an intensive multi-epoch approach. For typical
velocity dispersions of young massive clusters ($\gtrsim 4$ km s$^{-1}$) and
with a single epoch of data, we demonstrate that the method can just about
distinguish between a cluster in virial equilibrium and an unbound cluster.
This is due to the higher spectroscopic binary fraction and more loosely
constrained distributions of orbital parameters of OB stars compared to
solar-type stars. By extending the maximum likelihood method to multi-epoch

possible to identify the graph up to its Markov equivalence class. However, in
some situations one can find the true causal graph just from observational
data, for example in structural equation models with additive noise and
nonlinear edge functions. Most current methods for achieving this rely on
nonparametric independence tests. One of the problems there is that the null
hypothesis is independence, which is what one would like to get evidence for.
We take a different approach in our work by using a penalized likelihood as a
score for model selection. This is practically feasible in many settings and
has the advantage of yielding a natural ranking of the candidate models. When
making smoothness assumptions on the probability density space, we prove
consistency of the penalized maximum likelihood estimator. We also present

adaptation gain is related to the detectability of nonzero signal components as
characterized by Chernoff coefficients, thus quantifying analytically the
dependence on the sparsity level of the signal, the signal-to-noise ratio, and
the sensing resource budget. For fixed sparsity levels and increasing
signal-to-noise ratio or sensing budget, we obtain the rate of convergence to
oracle performance and the rate at which the fraction of resources spent on the
first exploratory stage decreases to zero. For a vanishing fraction of nonzero

in 2+1 dimensions using holographic method. We employ a class of
3+1-dimensional holographic models of Einstein-Maxwell system with gauge and
gravitational Chern-Simons terms coupled to a dynamical scalar field. The
scalar can condensate and break the parity spontaneously. We find that when the
scalar condensates, a non-vanishing angular momentum density and an associated
edge current are generated, and they receive contributions from both gauge and
gravitational Chern-Simons terms. The angular momentum density does not satisfy
a membrane paradigm form because the vector mode fluctuations from which it is
calculated are effectively massive. On the other hand, the emergence of Hall
viscosity is a consequence of the gravitational Chern-Simons term alone and it
has membrane paradigm form. We present both general analytic results and
numeric results which take back-reactions into account. The ratio between Hall
viscosity and angular momentum density resulting from the gravitational
Chern-Simons term has in general a deviation from the universal 1/2 value
obtained from field theory and condensed matter physics.

difficult due to its nonconvexity. A convex relaxation in the form of
semidefinite programming (SDP) has attracted much attention lately as it yields
a global solution in several practical cases. However, it does not in all
cases, and such cases have been documented in recent publications. This paper
presents another SDP method known as the moment-sos (sum of squares) approach,
which generates a sequence that converges towards a global solution to the OPF
problem at the cost of higher runtime. Our finding is that in the small
examples where the previously studied SDP method fails, this approach finds the
global solution. The higher cost in runtime is due to an increase in the matrix
size of the SDP problem, which can vary from one instance to another. Numerical
experiment shows that the size is very often a quadratic function of the number
of buses in the network, whereas it is a linear function of the number of buses
in the case of the previously studied SDP method.

understood concepts and structures have led to the fruitful development of the
hierarchy of number systems, non-euclidean geometry, and many other epochal
phases in mathematical progress. In the study of formalized theories of
arithmetic, it is only natural to consider the extension from the standard
model of Peano arithmetic, $\langle \mathbb{N},+,\times,\leq,0,1 \rangle$, to
non-standard models of arithmetic. The existence of non-standard models of
Peano arithmetic provided motivation in the early $20^{th}$ century for a
variety of questions in model theory regarding the classification of models up
to isomorphism and the properties that non-standard models of Peano arithmetic
have. This paper presents these questions and the necessary results to prove
Tennenbaum's Theorem, which draws an explicit line between the properties of
standard and non-standard models; namely, that no countable non-standard model
of Peano arithmetic is recursive. These model-theoretic results have
contributed to the foundational framework within which research programs
developed by Skolem, Rosser, Tarski, Mostowski and others have flourished.
While such foundational topics were crucial to active fields of research during
the middle of the $20^{th}$ century, numerous open questions about models of
arithmetic, and model theory in general, still remain pertinent to the realm of
$21^{st}$ century mathematical discourse.

two dimensional electron system subject to strong perpendicular magnetic fields
in 1980, a central question has been the interrelation between the conductance
quantisation and the topological properties of the system. It is conjectured
that if the electron system is described by a Bloch hamiltonian, then the
system is insulating in the bulk of the sample throughout the quantised Hall
plateau due to magnetic field induced energy gap. Meanwhile, the system is
conducting at the edges resembling a 2+1 dimensional topological insulator
without the time-reversal symmetry. However, the validity of this conjecture
remains unclear for finite size, non-periodically bounded real Hall bar
devices. Here we show experimentally that the close relationship proposed
between the quantised Hall effect and the topological bulk insulator is prone
to break for specific magnetic field intervals within the plateau evidenced by
our magneto-transport measurements performed on GaAs/AlGaAs high purity Hall
bars with two inner contacts embedded to bulk. Our data presents a similar

These fields are important candidates at explaining the origin of astrophysical
magnetism observed in galaxies and galaxy clusters, whose genesis is still by
and large unclear. Compared to the standard inflationary power spectrum,
intermediate to small scales would experience further substantial matter
clustering, were a cosmological magnetic field present prior to recombination.
As a consequence, the bias and redshift distribution of galaxies would also be
modified. Hitherto, primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) have been tested and
constrained with a number of cosmological observables, e.g. the cosmic
microwave background radiation, galaxy clustering and, more recently, weak
gravitational lensing. Here, we explore the constraining potential of the
density fluctuation bias induced by gravitational lensing magnification onto
the galaxy-galaxy angular power spectrum. Such an effect is known as
magnification bias. Compared to the usual galaxy clustering approach,
magnification bias helps in lifting the pathological degeneracy present amongst
power spectrum normalisation and galaxy bias. This is because magnification
bias cross-correlates galaxy number density fluctuations of nearby objects with
weak lensing distortions of high-redshift sources. Thus, it takes advantage of
the gravitational deflection of light, which is insensitive to galaxy bias but
powerful in constraining the density fluctuation amplitude. To scrutinise the
potentiality of this method, we adopt a deep and wide-field spectroscopic
galaxy survey. We show that magnification bias does contain important
information on primordial magnetism, which will be useful in combination with
galaxy clustering and shear. We find we shall be able to rule out at 95.4% CL
amplitudes of PMFs larger than 0.0005 nG for values of the PMF power spectral
index ~0.

  Cognitive Radio Networks with Noise Variance Uncertainty",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes novel spectrum sensing algorithms for cognitive radio
networks. By assuming known transmitter pulse shaping filter, synchronous and
asynchronous receiver scenarios have been considered. For each of these
scenarios, the proposed algorithm is explained as follows: First, by
introducing a combiner vector, an over-sampled signal of total duration equal
to the symbol period is combined linearly. Second, for this combined signal,
the Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) maximization and minimization problems are
formulated as Rayleigh quotient optimization problems. Third, by using the
solutions of these problems, the ratio of the signal energy corresponding to
the maximum and minimum SNRs are proposed as a test statistics. For this test
statistics, analytical probability of false alarm ($P_f$) and detection ($P_d$)
expressions are derived for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. The
proposed algorithms are robust against noise variance uncertainty. The
generalization of the proposed algorithms for unknown transmitter pulse shaping
filter has also been discussed. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed algorithms achieve better $P_d$ than that of the Eigenvalue
decomposition and energy detection algorithms in AWGN and Rayleigh fading
channels with noise variance uncertainty. The proposed algorithms also
guarantee the desired $P_f(P_d)$ in the presence of adjacent channel
interference signals.

subwavelength optical fibers as sensors for monitoring of the optical

Changes in the test film thickness and absorption losses can be measured
simultaneously by interpreting variations in the spectral resonant features in
the fiber transmission and reflection spectra. Particularly, changes in the
film thickness induce strong shifts in the fiber transmission peaks, while
changes in the film absorption induce notable amplitude variations in the fiber
reflection peaks. When applied to the problem of monitoring of thickness and
humidity content in the paper sheets, the proposed system shows sensitivity of
1.5 GHz / 10 um to changes in the paper thickness, and sensitivity of 0.6 / (%
of water by volume) to changes in the paper humidity. We estimate the detection
limit of our device to be 10 um for the paper thickness variation and 0.02% (of
water by volume) for the paper humidity variation. Proposed sensor is
implemented in the spirit of integrated optics, where a point device based on
the frequency selective surface is interrogated with a THz fiber that is used
for remote delivery of THz radiation.

we study the homotopy theory of diffeological spaces. We begin by proving basic
properties of the smooth homotopy groups that we will need later. Then we
introduce the smooth singular simplicial set $S^D(X)$ associated to a
diffeological space $X$, and show that when $S^D(X)$ is fibrant, it captures
smooth homotopical properties of $X$. Motivated by this, we define $X$ to be
fibrant when $S^D(X)$ is, and more generally define cofibrations, fibrations
and weak equivalences in the category of diffeological spaces using the smooth
singular simplicial set functor. We conjecture that these form a model category
structure, but in this paper we assume little prior knowledge of model
categories, and instead focus on concrete questions about smooth manifolds and
diffeological spaces. We prove that our setup generalizes the naive smooth
homotopy theory of smooth manifolds by showing that a smooth manifold without
boundary is fibrant and that for fibrant diffeological spaces, the weak
equivalences can be detected using ordinary smooth homotopy groups. We also
show that our definition of fibrations generalizes Iglesias-Zemmour's theory of
diffeological bundles. We prove enough of the model category axioms to show
that every diffeological space has a functorial cofibrant replacement. We give
many explicit examples of objects that are cofibrant, not cofibrant, fibrant
and not fibrant, as well as many other examples showing the richness of the
theory. For example, we show that the free loop space of a smooth manifold is
fibrant. One of the implicit points of this paper is that the language of model
categories is an effective way to organize homotopical thinking, even when it
is not known that all of the model category axioms are satisfied.

particle image velocimetry (PIV). Turbulent convection velocities are of
interest because they can be used to map temporal information into space.
Convection velocity can be defined in several different ways. One approach is
to use the phase-spectrum of two signals with a time-separation. Obtaining
convection velocity per wavenumber involves determining a spatial spectrum. PIV
data is limited in spatial resolution and sample length. The influence of
truncation of both spatial resolution and frequency resolution is investigated,
as well as the influences of spatial filtering and measurement noise. These
issues are investigated by using a synthetic data set obtained by creating
velocity-time data with an imposed spectrum. Results from the validation show
that, when applying a Hamming window before determining the phase spectrum,
there is a usable range of wavenumbers for which convection velocities can be
determined. Simulation of flow evolution, movement into and out of the
measurement plane, and measurement noise show that these result in a spread in
convection velocities using the current approach. Despite this spread, the most
probable calculated convection velocity coincides with the imposed convection
velocity. Application of the phase-spectral approach to a turbulent boundary
layer with $Re_\tau \approx 2700$, shows there is a range of convection
velocities and that the most probable convection velocity is equal to the local
mean velocity.

gadolinium-loaded water Cherenkov detectors. The forward-peaked nature of
$\nu_e + e^- \rightarrow \nu_e + e^-$ allows an angular cut that contains the
majority of events. Even in a narrow cone, near-isotropic inverse beta events,
$\bar{\nu}_e + p \rightarrow e^+ + n$, are a large background. With neutron
detection by radiative capture on gadolinium, the background events can be
individually identified with high efficiency. The remaining backgrounds are
smaller and can be measured separately, so they can be statistically
subtracted. Super-Kamiokande with gadolinium could measure the total and
average energy of supernova $\nu_e$ with $\sim$ $20\%$ precision or better each
($90\%$ C.L.). Hyper-Kamiokande with gadolinium could improve this by a factor

two stripped-envelope supernovae (SNe) 2010O and 2010P that exploded in two
different components of an interacting luminous infrared galaxy Arp 299 within
only a few days of one another. SN 2010O is found to be photometrically and
spectroscopically similar to many normal Type Ib SNe and our multiwavelength
observations of SN 2010P suggest it to be a Type IIb SN. No signs of clear
hydrogen features or interaction with the circumstellar medium are evident in
the optical spectrum of SN 2010P. We derive estimates for the host galaxy
line-of-sight extinctions for both SNe, based on both light-curve and
spectroscopic comparison finding consistent results. These methods are also
found to provide much more robust estimates of the SN host galaxy reddening
than the commonly used empirical relations between extinction and equivalent
width of Na I D absorption features. The SN observations also suggest that
different extinction laws are present in different components of Arp 299. For
completeness, we study high-resolution pre-explosion images of Arp 299 and find
both SNe to be close to, but not coincident with, extended sources that are
likely massive clusters. A very simple model applied to the bolometric light
curve of SN 2010O implies a rough estimate for the explosion parameters of
$E_{\mathrm{k}} \approx 3 \times 10^{51}$ erg, $M_{\mathrm{ej}} \approx 2.9$
M$_{\odot}$ and $M_{\mathrm{Ni}} \approx 0.16$ M$_{\odot}$.

Nodal quasiparticle states are well established in copper-oxide, and

study the pairing symmetry and mechanism of a new class of plutonium-based
high-Tc superconductors and predict the presence of a nodal $s^{+-}$ wave
pairing symmetry in this family. Starting from a density-functional theory
(DFT) based electronic structure calculation we predict several
three-dimensional (3D) Fermi surfaces in this 115 superconductor family. We
identify the dominant Fermi surface ``hot-spots' in the inter-band scattering
channel, which are aligned along the wavevector ${\bf Q}\sim(\pi,\pi,\pi)$,
where degeneracy could induce sign-reversal of the pairing symmetry. Our
calculation demonstrates that the $s^{+-}$ wave pairing strength is stronger
than the previously thought $d$-wave pairing; and more importantly, this
pairing state allows for the existence of nodal quasiparticles. Finally, we
predict the shape of the momentum- and energy-dependent magnetic resonance
spectrum for the identification of this pairing symmetry.

variety of high resolution spectrographs. We confirm significant differences in
the Li distribution of solar twins (T$_\mathrm{eff}$ = T$_{\odot} \pm$ 80 K,
log g = log g$_{\odot}$ $\pm$ 0.2 and [Fe/H] = [Fe/H]$_{\odot} \pm$ 0.2): the
full sample of planet host stars (22) shows Li average values lower than
""single"" stars with no detected planets (60). If we focus in subsamples with
narrower ranges in metallicity and age, we observe indications of a similar
result though it is not so clear for some of the studied subsamples.
Furthermore, we compare the observed spectra of several couples of stars with
very similar parameters which show different Li abundances up to 1.6 dex.
Therefore we show that neither age, nor mass nor metallicity of a parent star
is the only responsible for enhanced Li depletion in solar analogues. We
conclude that another variable must account for that difference and suggest
that this could be the presence of planets which causes additional rotationally
induced mixing in the external layers of planet host stars. Moreover, we find
indications that the amount of depletion of Li in planet host solar-type stars
is higher when the planets are more massive than Jupiter.

high-activation-energy limit typically studied in stability analyses of

our calculations do show a modest delay in the onset of instability in
agreement with recently reported calculations by direct numerical simulation of
the physical equations, our approach, based on the Evans function, also
provides additional spectral information. In particular, for each of the
families of detonation waves in our computational domain, we find a completely
unexpected kind of hysteresis in the limit of increasing activation energy;
that is, our calculations suggest that, whenever diffusive effects are present,
there is a return to stability as unstable eigenvalues return to the stable

reduces their observable effects. However, time dependence can upset the
cancellation of these anti-correlated fluctuations and greatly enhance their
effects. This form of non-cancellation is investigated for spacetime geometry
fluctuations driven by the vacuum stress tensor fluctuations of the
electromagnetic field. The time dependence can take the form of sinusoidal
conformal metric perturbations or of time variation of the gravitational
constant, both of which can arise from modifications of the gravitational
action. We examine two observable quantities, luminosity fluctuations and
redshift fluctuations, both of which can arise from stress tensor fluctuations.
We find that both quantities can grow with increasing distance between a source

species containing the positively charged muon and the muonic Helium, i.e., the
negatively charged muon plus helium nucleus, as exotic isotopes of hydrogen,
using the newly developed multi-component quantum theory of atoms in molecules
(MC-QTAIM) analysis, employing ab initio non-Born-Oppenhiemer wavefunctions.
Accordingly, the ""atoms in molecules"" analysis performed on various asymmetric
exotic isotopomers of hydrogen molecule, recently detected experimentally
[Science 331, 448 (2011)], demonstrates that both the exotic isotopes are
capable of forming atoms in molecules and retaining the identity of hydrogen
atom. Various derived properties of atomic basins containing muonic helium cast
no doubt that apart from its short life time, it is a heavier isotope of
hydrogen while the properties of basins containing the positively charged muon
are more remote from those of the orthodox hydrogen basins, capable of
appreciable donation of electrons as well as large charge polarization;
however, with some tolerance, they may be categorized also as hydrogen basins
though with a smaller electronegativity. All in all, present study also clearly
demonstrates that the MC-QTAIM analysis is an efficient approach to decipher
the chemical nature of species containing exotic constituents, hard to be
elucidated by experimental and/or alternative theoretical schemes.

control and enhance the down-conversion using optical resonances. On the top of
the rare-earths doped layer, a silicon nitride (SiN) 2D planar PhC is
synthesized. For that, SiN is first deposited by PECVD. After holographic
lithography and reactive ion etching, a periodic square lattice of holes is
generated on the SiN layer. The PhC topographical parameters as well as the

The design and realization of such PhC-assisted down-converter structures is
presented. Optical simulations demonstrate that the PhC leads to the
establishment of resonant modes located in the underneath doped layer, allowing
a drastic enhancement of the absorption of the rare-earth ions without
disturbing the transmission in the visible and near-IR parts of the spectrum,
hence demonstrating the relevance of such an approach.

corresponding to Q2 of 0.025 GeV2 were detected in eight Cerenkov detectors
arrayed symmetrically around the beam axis. The goals of the experiment were to
provide a measure of Qweak(p) to 4.2 percent (combined statistical and

Multiplexed (OFDM) signals in cognitive radio networks. We assume that the
noise samples are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) random
variables all with unknown (imperfect) variance. Our detection algorithm employ
the following three steps. First, we formulate the test statistics as a ratio
of two quadratic cyclic autocorrelation functions. Second, we derive a closed
form expression for the false alarm probability. Third, we evaluate the
detection probability of our algorithm for a given false alarm probability. The
theoretical probability of false alarm expression matches with that of the
simulation result. Moreover, we have observed that the proposed multi-cycle
algorithm exhibits significantly superior probability of detection compared to
the existing low complexity cyclostationary based and the well known energy

Radioastronomie Millim\'etrique (IRAM) in March and April 2013 (rh = 4.45 -
4.18 AU). The HIFI instrument aboard Herschel was used to observe the H$_{2}$O
$1_{10}-1_{01}$ line at 557 GHz, whereas images of the dust coma at 70 and 160
{\mu}m were acquired with the PACS instrument. Spectra acquired at the IRAM 30m
telescope cover the CO J(2-1) line at 230.5 GHz. The spectral observations were
analysed with excitation and radiative transfer models. A model of dust thermal
emission taking into account a range of dust sizes is used to analyse the PACS
maps. While H$_{2}$O was not detected in our 8 March 2013 observation, we
derive a sensitive 3 $\sigma$ upper limit of QH$_{2}$O < 3.5 x 10$^{26}$
molecules/s for this date. A marginal 3.2 $\sigma$ detection of CO is found,
corresponding to a CO production rate of QCO = 3.5 x 10$^{27}$ molecules/s. The
Herschel PACS measurements show a clear detection of the coma and tail in both
the 70 {\mu}m and 160 {\mu}m maps. Under the assumption of a 2 km radius
nucleus, we infer dust production rates in the range 10 - 13 kg/s or 40 - 70
kg/s depending on whether a low or high gaseous activity from the nucleus
surface is assumed. We constrain the size distribution of the emitted dust by
comparing PACS 70 and 160 {\mu}m data, and considering optical data. Size
indices between -4 and -3.6 are suggested. The morphology of the tail observed
on 70 {\mu}m images can be explained by the presence of grains with ages older

galaxies and immediate environments are in any way special compared with other
star-forming galaxies. Here we present spatially resolved maps of dust emission
of the host galaxy of the closest known GRB 980425 at z=0.0085 using our new
high-resolution observations from Herschel, Atacama Pathfinder Experiment
(APEX), Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and Australia Telescope Compact
Array (ATCA). We modelled the spectral energy distributions of the host and of
the star-forming region displaying the Wolf-Rayet signatures in the spectrum
(WR region), located 800 pc from the GRB position. The host is characterised by
low dust content and a high fraction of UV-visible star formation, similar to
other dwarf galaxies. These galaxies are abundant in the local universe, so it
is not surprising to find a GRB in one of them, assuming the correspondence
between the GRB rate and star formation. The WR region contributes
substantially to the host emission at the far-infrared, millimetre, and radio
wavelengths and we propose that this is a consequence of its high gas density.
If dense environments are also found close to the positions of other GRBs, then
the ISM density should also be considered, along with metallicity, an important
factor influencing whether a given stellar population can produce a GRB.

obtain the same flux scale across the whole image. One method for obtaining the
best possible flat fielding accuracy is to derive a photometric model from
dithered stellar observations. A large variety of effects have been taken into
account in such modelling. Recently, Moehler et al. (2010) discovered
systematic variations in available flat frames for the European Southern
Observatory's FORS instrument that change with the orientation of the projected
image on the sky. The effect on photometry is large compared to other
systematic effects that have already been taken into account. In this paper, we
present a correction method for this effect: a generalization of the fitting
procedure of Bramich & Freudling (2012) to include a polynomial representation
of rotating flat fields. We then applied the method to the specific case of
FORS2 photometric observations of a series of standard star fields, and provide
parametrised solutions that can be applied by the users. We found polynomial
coefficients to describe the static and rotating large-scale systematic
flat-field variations across the FORS2 field of view. Applying these
coefficients to FORS2 data, the systematic changes in the flux scale across
FORS2 images can be improved by ~1% to ~2% of the total flux. This represents a
significant improvement in the era of large-scale surveys, which require
homogeneous photometry at the 1% level or better.

sections for dark atoms. We find an intricate dependence upon the ratio of the
dark proton to electron mass, allowing for the possibility to ""design""
low-energy features in the cross section. Dependences upon other parameters,
namely the gauge coupling and reduced mass, scale out of the problem by using
atomic units. We derive constraints on the parameter space of dark atoms by
demanding that their scattering cross section does not exceed bounds from dark
matter halo shapes. We discuss the formation of molecular dark hydrogen in the
universe, and determine the analogous constraints on the model when the dark
matter is predominantly in molecular form.

overlooked segment of the post-starburst population, containing exactly those
objects in which the AGN is actively expelling the star-forming material. While
AGN activity is not the likely driver of the post-starburst event that occurred
500 Myr ago, the faint spiral structure seen in the Hubble Space Telescope

the possibility of gravitational torques being the culprit. If the molecular
gas were driven into the center at the same time as the larger scale galaxy

molecular gas for $\gtrsim 1$ Gyr by cyclically injecting turbulent kinetic

there is no gauged supergravity description for the solution, regardless of the

combinations of the bulk gauge field and timelike vielbein where one asymptotes
to the boundary timelike vielbein and the other to the boundary gauge field.
The geometry induced from the bulk onto the boundary is a novel extension of
Newton-Cartan geometry that we call torsional Newton-Cartan (TNC) geometry.
There is a constraint on the sources but its pairing with a Ward identity
allows one to reduce the variation of the on-shell action to unconstrained
sources. We compute all the vevs along with their Ward identities and derive
conditions for the boundary theory to admit conserved currents obtained by
contracting the boundary stress-energy tensor with a TNC analogue of a
conformal Killing vector. We also obtain the anisotropic Weyl anomaly that
takes the form of a Horava-Lifshitz action defined on a TNC geometry. The
Fefferman-Graham expansion contains a free function that does not appear in the

in different local environments at 0.01<=z<=0.08. The central galaxies are
separated into two categories: group centrals (host halos containing
satellites) and field centrals (host halos without satellites). From the
latter, we select other two subsamples: isolated centrals and bright field
centrals, both with the same magnitude limit. The stellar mass (Ms)
distributions of the field and group central galaxies are different, which
explains why in general the field central galaxies are mainly located in the
blue cloud/star forming regions, whereas the group central galaxies are
strongly biased to the red sequence/passive regions. The isolated centrals
occupy the same regions as the bright field centrals since both populations
have similar Ms distributions. At parity of Ms, the color and specific star
formation rate (sSFR) distributions of the samples are similar, specially
between field and group centrals. Furthermore, we find that the stellar-to-halo
mass (Ms-Mh) relation of isolated galaxies does not depend on the color, sSFR
and morphological type. For systems without satellites, the Ms-Mh relation
steepens at high halo masses compared to group centrals, which is a consequence
of assuming a one-to-one relation between group total stellar mass and halo
mass. Under the same assumption, the scatter around the Ms-Mh relation of
centrals with satellites increases with halo mass. Our results suggest that the
mass growth of central galaxies is mostly driven by the halo mass, with
environment and mergers playing a secondary role.

consist of non-compact elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau fourfolds which also
admit a K3 fibration. The compact elliptic model obtained by gluing need not
have a globally defined K3 fibration. By replacing the K3 fiber of each
F-theory building block with a T^2, we reach building blocks in a heterotic
dual vacuum which includes a position dependent dilaton and three-form flux.
These building blocks are glued together to reach a heterotic flux background.
We argue that in these vacua, the gauge fields of the heterotic string become
localized, and remain dynamical even when gravity decouples. This enables a
heterotic dual for the hyperflux GUT breaking mechanism which has recently
figured prominently in F-theory GUT models. We illustrate our general proposal

the evolution and properties of close binary systems. The uncertainty in the
parameters of the model and their effect on a population can be tested in a
statistical way, which then leads to a deeper understanding of the underlying
physical processes involved. To understand the predictive power of BPS codes,
we study the similarities and differences in the predicted populations of four
different BPS codes for low- and intermediate-mass binaries. We investigate
whether the differences are caused by different assumptions made in the BPS
codes or by numerical effects. To simplify the complex problem of comparing BPS
codes, we equalise the inherent assumptions as much as possible. We find that
the simulated populations are similar between the codes. Regarding the
population of binaries with one WD, there is very good agreement between the
physical characteristics, the evolutionary channels that lead to the birth of
these systems, and their birthrates. Regarding the double WD population, there
is a good agreement on which evolutionary channels exist to create double WDs
and a rough agreement on the characteristics of the double WD population.
Regarding which progenitor systems lead to a single and double WD system and
which systems do not, the four codes agree well. Most importantly, we find that
for these two populations, the differences in the predictions from the four
codes are not due to numerical differences, but because of different inherent
assumptions. We identify critical assumptions for BPS studies that need to be
studied in more detail.

algorithms like iterative linear solvers cease progress towards the correct

dispersion integrals are evaluated using experimental data on elastic deuteron
form factors and inelastic electron-deuteron scattering, both in the
quasielastic and hadronic range. The subtraction constant that is required to
ensure convergence of the dispersion relation for the forward Compton amplitude
$T_1(\nu,Q^2)$ is related to the deuteron magnetic polarizability $\beta(Q^2)$.
Based on phenomenological information, we obtain for the Lamb shift $\Delta

clumpy structures across the remnant with enhanced emission along the western

thermal model with a column density N_H ~ 2.6e22 cm^{-2} and a total luminosity
of L_X ~ 3.3e37 ergs/s (0.5-10 keV, at an assumed distance of 8.5 kpc). The
soft component is characterized by a temperature kT_s ~ 0.5 keV, a high
ionization timescale, and enhanced Si and S abundances suggesting emission that
is dominated by shocked ejecta. The hard component has a temperature kT_h ~ 1.6
keV, a relatively low ionization timescale, and mostly solar abundances
suggesting emission that is dominated by interstellar/circumstellar shocked
material. A spatially resolved spectroscopy study reveals no significant
variations in the spectral properties. We infer an SNR age ranging between 750
yr and 2100 yr, an explosion energy of ~0.3e51 ergs and a shock velocity of
1200 km/s (under the Sedov phase assumption). We also discuss the possible
scenario for Kes 73 expanding into the late red supergiant wind phase of its
massive progenitor. Comparing the inferred metal abundances to core-collapse

stars. To date, the best known case of a binary merger is the V1309 Sco
outburst, where the orbital period was known and observed to decay up to the
outburst. Using the hydrodynamical code StarSmasher, we study in detail which
characteristics of the progenitor binary affect the outburst and produce the
best match with observations. We have developed a set of tools in order to
quantify any common envelope event. We consider binaries consisting of a
1.52$M_\odot$ giant and a 0.16$M_\odot$ companion with $P_{\rm orb}\sim1.4$
days, varying the nature of the companion and its synchronization. We show that
all considered progenitor binaries evolve towards the merger primarily due to
the Darwin instability. The merger is accompanied by mass ejection that
proceeds in several separate mass outbursts and takes away a few percent of the
donor mass. This very small mass, nonetheless, is important as it is not only
sufficient to explain the observed light-curve, but it also carries away up to
1/3 of the both initial total angular momentum and initial orbital energy. We
find that all synchronized systems experience $L_2$ mass loss that operates
during just a few days prior to merger and produces ring-shaped ejecta. The
formed star is always a strongly heated radiative star that differentially
rotates. We conclude that the case of a synchronized binary with a
main-sequence companion gives the best match with observations of V1309 Sco.

it has been difficult to accurately study them. For example, videos uploaded by
users with large social networks may tend to be more popular because they tend
to have more interesting content, not because social network size has a
substantial direct impact on popularity. In this paper, we develop and apply a
methodology that is able to accurately assess, both qualitatively and
quantitatively, the impacts of various content-agnostic factors on video
popularity. When controlling for video content, we observe a strong linear
""rich-get-richer"" behavior, with the total number of previous views as the most

is found to be video age. We analyze a number of phenomena that may contribute
to rich-get-richer, including the first-mover advantage, and search bias
towards popular videos. For young videos we find that factors other than the
total number of previous views, such as uploader characteristics and number of

distributions that have been tried, the generalized hyperbolic distribution has
the advantage that is a generalization of several other methods, such as the
Gaussian distribution, the skew t-distribution, etc. With specific parameters,
it can represent either a symmetric or a skewed distribution. While its
inherent flexibility is an advantage in many ways, it means the estimation of
more parameters than its special and limiting cases. The aim of this work is to
propose a mixture of generalized hyperbolic factor analyzers to introduce
parsimony and extend the method to high dimensional data. This work can be seen
as an extension of the mixture of factor analyzers model to generalized

The research has
focussed on development of normalised phase space techniques. It starts with
the idea of sampling tomographic projections at equal phase advances and shows
that this would give the optimal reconstruction results. This idea has
influenced the design, construction and operation of the tomography sections at
the Photo Injector Test Facility at Zeuthen (PITZ) and at the Accelerator and
Laser in Combined Experiments (ALICE) at Daresbury. The theoretical
justification of this idea is later developed through simulations and analysis
of the measurements results at ALICE. The mathematical formalism is constructed
around the normalised phase space and the idea of equal phase advances become
the basis of this. This formalism is applied to a variety of experimental and
simulated situations and shown to be useful in improving resolution, increasing
reliability and providing diagnostic information. In this review, we also
present the simplifying concepts, formalisms and simulation tools that we have
developed.

Minor text and figure improvements",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Following from a question of Wheeler, why does the Hamiltonian constraint
${\cal H}$ of GR have the particular form it does? A first answer, by Hojman,
Kucha\v{r} and Teitelboim, is that using embeddability into spacetime as a
principle gives the form of ${\cal H}$. The present paper culminates a second
Machian answer - initially by Barbour, Foster and \'{o} Murchadha - in which
space but not spacetime are assumed. Thus this answer is additionally a
classical-level resolution of the spacetime reconstruction problem. In this
approach, mere consistency imposed by the Dirac procedure whittles down a
general ansatz to one of four alternatives: Lorentzian, Galilean, or Carrollian
relativity, or constant mean curvature slicing. These arise together as the
different ways to kill off a 4-factor obstruction term. It is novel for such an
alternative to arise from principles of dynamics considerations (in contrast
with the historical form of the dichotomy between universal local Galilean or
Lorentzian relativity). It is furthermore intriguing that it gives constant
mean curvature slicing - familiar from York's work on the initial value problem
-- as a further option on a similar footing. That is related to a number of
recent alternative theories/formulations of GR known collectively as `shape
dynamics'. The original work did not treat this with Poisson brackets and a
proper systematic Dirac-type analysis; we rectify this in this paper. It is
also the first demonstration of how this approach solves the classical
spacetime reconstruction problem via `hypersurface tensor dual nationality' and
what can be interpreted as embedding equations arising.

important to potential buyers, especially when the seller is unknown to them.
Most existing trust evaluation models compute a single value to reflect the
general trust level of a seller without taking any transaction context
information into account. In this paper, we first present a trust vector
consisting of three values for Contextual Transaction Trust (CTT). In the
computation of three CTT values, the identified three important context
dimensions, including product category, transaction amount and transaction
time, are taken into account. In particular, with different parameters
regarding context dimensions that are specified by a buyer, different sets of
CTT values can be calculated. As a result, all these values can outline the
reputation profile of a seller that indicates the dynamic trust levels of a
seller in different product categories, price ranges, time periods, and any
necessary combination of them. We term this new model as ReputationPro.
However, in ReputationPro, the computation of reputation profile requires novel
algorithms for the precomputation of aggregates over large-scale ratings and
transaction data of three context dimensions as well as new data structures for
appropriately indexing aggregation results to promptly answer buyers' CTT
requests. To solve these challenging problems, we then propose a new index
scheme CMK-tree. After that, we further extend CMK-tree and propose a
CMK-treeRS approach to reducing the storage space allocated to each seller.
Finally, the experimental results illustrate that the CMK-tree is superior in
efficiency for computing CTT values to all three existing approaches in the
literature. In addition, though with reduced storage space, the CMK-treeRS
approach can further improve the performance in answering buyers' CTT queries.

A complex interplay of carbon and oxygen burning, especially in shells, can
cause rapid variations in the compactness for stars of very nearly the same
mass. On larger scales, the distribution of compactness with main sequence mass
is found to be robustly non-monotonic, implying islands of ""explodability"",

(IMF), star formation mode, and properties of pre-main sequence stars (PMS). A
UBVI and H alpha photometric study of the young open cluster IC 1848 was
conducted as part of the ""Sejong Open cluster Survey"" (SOS). We have selected
105 early-type members from photometric diagrams. Their mean reddening is
<E(B-V)> = 0.660 +/- 0.054 mag. Using the published photometric data with near-
and mid-infrared archival data we confirmed the normal reddening law (R_V =
3.1) toward the cluster (IC 1848). A careful zero-age main sequence fitting
gives a distance modulus of V_0 - M_V = 11.7 +/- 0.2 mag, equivalent to 2.2 +/-
0.2 kpc. H alpha photometry and the list of young stellar objects identified by
Koenig et al. permitted us to select a large number of PMS stars comprising 196
H alpha emission stars, 35 H alpha emission candidates, 5 Class I, 368 Class
II, and 24 transition disk candidates. From the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram
using stellar evolution models, we estimate an age of 5 Myr from several
evolved stars and 3 Myr from the PMS stars. The IMF was derived from stars with
mass larger than 3 M_sun, and the slope is slightly steeper (Gamma = -1.6 +/-
0.2) than the Salpeter/Kroupa IMF. Finally, we estimated the mass accretion
rate of PMS stars with a UV excess. The mean mass accretion rate is about 1.4 x
10^-8 M_sun yr^-1 in the mass range of 0.5 M_sun to 2 M_sun, whereas
intermediate-mass stars (>= 2.5 M_sun) exhibit a much higher accretion rate of
dM/dt > 10^-6 M_sun yr^-1.

bilayer graphene with velocity modulation in space are investigated in presence
of the previously created band gap. It is pointed out that the velocity
engineering is considered as a factor to control the band gap of
symmetry-broken bilayer graphene. The band gap is direct and independent of
velocity value if velocity modulated in two layers is set up equally.
Otherwise, in the case of interlayer asymmetric velocity, not only the band gap
is indirect, but also the electron-hole symmetry fails. This band gap is
controllable by the ratio of the velocity modulated in the upper layer to the
velocity modulated in the lower layer. In more detail, the shift of momentum
from the conduction band edge to the valence band edge can be engineered by the
gate bias and velocity ratio. A transfer matrix method is also elaborated to
calculate four-band coherent conductance through a velocity barrier possibly
subjected to a gate bias. Electronic transport depends on the ratio of velocity
modulated inside the barrier to the one for surrounding regions. As a result, a
quantum version of total internal reflection is observed for enough thick
velocity barriers. Moreover, a transport gap originating from the applied gate
bias is engineered by modulating velocity of the carriers in the upper and
lower layers.

vesicles in a viscous fluid. A new feature of this work is the implementation
of the local inextensibility condition in the diffuse interface context. Local
inextensibility is enforced by using a local Lagrange multiplier, which
provides the necessary tension force at the interface. To solve for the local
Lagrange multiplier, we introduce a new equation whose solution essentially
provides a harmonic extension of the local Lagrange multiplier off the
interface while maintaining the local inextensibility constraint near the
interface. To make the method more robust, we develop a local relaxation scheme
that dynamically corrects local stretching/compression errors thereby
preventing their accumulation. Asymptotic analysis is presented that shows that
our new system converges to a relaxed version of the inextensible sharp
interface model. This is also verified numerically. Although the model does not
depend on dimension, we present numerical simulations only in 2D. To solve the
2D equations numerically, we develop an efficient algorithm combining an
operator splitting approach with adaptive finite elements where the
Navier-Stokes equations are implicitly coupled to the diffuse interface
inextensibility equation. Numerical simulations of a single vesicle in a shear
flow at different Reynolds numbers demonstrate that errors in enforcing local
inextensibility may accumulate and lead to large differences in the dynamics in
the tumbling regime and differences in the inclination angle of vesicles in the
tank-treading regime. The local relaxation algorithm is shown to effectively
prevent this accumulation by driving the system back to its equilibrium state
when errors in local inextensibility arise.

deforestation. Our prototype achieves time and memory efficiency comparable to

however many researchers argue that the contribution of abrasion to downstream
fining is negligible. This presents a paradox: downstream shape change
indicates substantial abrasion, while size change apparently rules it out. Here
we use laboratory experiments and numerical modeling to show quantitatively
that pebble abrasion is a curvature-driven flow problem. As a consequence,
abrasion occurs in two well-separated phases: first, pebble edges rapidly round
without any change in axis dimensions until the shape becomes entirely convex;
and second, axis dimensions are then slowly reduced while the particle remains
convex. Explicit study of pebble shape evolution helps resolve the shape-size
paradox by reconciling discrepancies between laboratory and field studies, and

to the spectral broadening of mechanical resonances, and to an apparent quality

remained elusive for many years. Our results shed light on the role played by

speed up inference. They show impressive performance when calculating
unconditional probabilities in relational models, but often resort to
non-lifted inference when computing conditional probabilities. The reason is
that conditioning on evidence breaks many of the model's symmetries, which can
preempt standard lifting techniques. Recent theoretical results show, for
example, that conditioning on evidence which corresponds to binary relations is
#P-hard, suggesting that no lifting is to be expected in the worst case. In
this paper, we balance this negative result by identifying the Boolean rank of
the evidence as a key parameter for characterizing the complexity of
conditioning in lifted inference. In particular, we show that conditioning on
binary evidence with bounded Boolean rank is efficient. This opens up the
possibility of approximating evidence by a low-rank Boolean matrix
factorization, which we investigate both theoretically and empirically.

algorithms have become a common way for processing and analyzing
high-dimensional patterns that often have attached a target that corresponds to
the value of an unknown function. Their application to new points consists in
two steps: first, embedding the new data point into the low dimensional space
and then, estimating the function value on the test point from its neighbors in
the embedded space.
  However, finding the low dimension representation of a test point, while easy
for simple but often not powerful enough procedures such as PCA, can be much
more complicated for methods that rely on some kind of eigenanalysis, such as
Spectral Clustering (SC) or Diffusion Maps (DM). Similarly, when a target
function is to be evaluated, averaging methods like nearest neighbors may give
unstable results if the function is noisy. Thus, the smoothing of the target
function with respect to the intrinsic, low-dimensional representation that
describes the geometric structure of the examined data is a challenging task.
  In this paper we propose Auto-adaptive Laplacian Pyramids (ALP), an extension
of the standard Laplacian Pyramids model that incorporates a modified LOOCV
procedure that avoids the large cost of the standard one and offers the
following advantages: (i) it selects automatically the optimal function
resolution (stopping time) adapted to the data and its noise, (ii) it is easy
to apply as it does not require parameterization, (iii) it does not overfit the
training set and (iv) it adds no extra cost compared to other classical
interpolation methods. We illustrate numerically ALP's behavior on a synthetic
problem and apply it to the computation of the DM projection of new patterns
and to the extension to them of target function values on a radiation
forecasting problem over very high dimensional patterns.

one opacity for the infrared) are useful to understand the global structure of
irradiated atmospheres, their dynamics and the interior structure and evolution
of planets, brown dwarfs and stars. But when compared to direct numerical
radiative transfer calculations for irradiated exoplanets, these models
systematically overestimate the temperatures at low optical depth,
independently of the opacity parameters. We wish to understand why semi-grey
models fail at low optical depths, and provide a more accurate approximation to
the atmospheric structure by accounting for the variable opacity in the
infrared. Our analytical irradiated non-grey model is found to provide a range
of temperatures that is consistent with that obtained by numerical
calculations. We find that even for slightly non-grey thermal opacities the
temperature structure differs significantly from previous semi-grey models. For
small values of beta (expected when lines are dominant), we find that the
non-grey effects are confined to low-optical depths. However, for beta larger
than 0.5 (appropriate in the presence of bands with a wavelength-dependence
smaller or comparable with the width of the Planck function), we find that the
temperature structure is affected even down to infrared optical depths unity
and deeper as a result of the so-called blanketing effect. The expressions that
we derive may be used to provide a proper functional form for algorithms that
invert the atmospheric properties from spectral information. Because a full
atmospheric structure can be calculated directly, these expressions should be
useful for simulations of the dynamics of these atmospheres and of the thermal
evolution of the planets. Finally, they should be used to test full radiative
transfer models and improve their convergence.

functional supercell plane wave calculations in bulk diamond. In additionthe
activation energy for V and NV diffusion is calculated.We find good agreement
between theory and experiment for the previously well-establisheddata, and
predict missing ones. Based on the calculated properties of these defects, the
formation of the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy center is studied, which
is a prominent candidate for application in quantum information processing and
for nanosensors. We find that the concentration of NV defects are limited in
natural diamonds due to the relatively high formation energy of NV. Our results
imply that NV defects dominantly form just in the early stage of annealing in
N-doped and irradiated diamonds. We find that the amphoteric divacancy defect
with multiple acceptor states may significantly influence the charge state and
photo-stability of NV in irradiated diamond samples.

the estimation precision of the parameter depends on the fluctuation of the

estimation. By invoking the Schr\""odinger-Robertson uncertainty relation, we
derive the necessary and sufficient condition for the optimal observables
saturating the ultimate sensitivity for single parameter estimate. By applying
this condition to Greenberg-Horne-Zeilinger states, we obtain the general
expression of the optimal observable for separable measurements to achieve the
Heisenberg-limit precision and show that it is closely related to the parity
measurement. However, Jose {\em et al} [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 87}, 022330 (2013)]

problem of the general ordinary differential equation is proposed. It is
obtained by natural modifications of the well-known leapfrog method, which is a
second order, two-step, explicit method. According to the latter method, the
input data for an integration step are two system states, which refer to
different times. The usage of two states instead of a single one can be seen as
the reason for the robustness of the method. Since the time step size thus is
part of the step input data, it is complicated to change this size during the
computation of a discrete trajectory. This is a serious drawback when one needs
to implement automatic time step control.
  The proposed modification transforms one of the two input states into a
velocity and thus gets rid of the time step dependency in the step input data.
For these new step input data, the leapfrog method gives a unique prescription
how to evolve them stepwise.
  The stability properties of this modified method are the same as for the
original one: the set of absolute stability is the interval [-i,+i] on the
imaginary axis. This implies exponential growth of trajectories in situations
where the exact trajectory has an asymptote.
  By considering new evolution steps that are composed of two consecutive old
evolution steps we can average over the velocities of the sub-steps and get an
integrator with a much larger set of absolute stability, which is immune to the
asymptote problem.
  The method is exemplified with the equation of motion of a one-dimensional
non-linear oscillator describing the radial motion in the Kepler problem.

able to sustain some activities and to reach effects generating innovation
outcomes. This issue is tackled introducing a new framework in which we propose
a network model as prerequisite for our hypothesis. The analysis is focused on
inter-organizational innovation networks characterized by the presence of hubs,
semi-peripheral and peripheral members lacking hierarchical authority. We
sustain that the features of a network, bringing to synchronization phenomena,
are extremely similar to those existing in innovation network characterized by
the emergence of choreography. The effectiveness of our model is verified by
providing a real case study that gives preliminary empirical hints on the
network aptitude to perform choreography. Indeed, the innovation network
analysed in the case study reveals characteristics causing synchronization and
consequently the establishment of choreography.

magnetization. These effects are generally analyzed using two distinct models

is the main mechanism for field induced oscillations in resistance R(H),
critical current Ic(H), magnetization M(H) and ac-susceptibility Xac(H) in a
broad temperature range. Due to the coherence length divergence at Tc, a
crossover to wire network behavior is experimentally found. While pinning
occurs in a wide temperature range up to Tc, wire network behavior is only
present in a very narrow temperature window close to Tc. In this temperature
interval, contributions from both mechanisms are operational but can be

Euclidean correlator of the energy-momentum tensor at vanishing frequency and
low momentum. This allows for a lattice determination without maximum entropy
methods or modelling, but the required lattice sizes represent a formidable
challenge. We calculate $\kappa$ in leading order lattice perturbation theory
and simulations on $120^3\times 6,8$ lattices with $a<0.1$ fm. In the

equilibrates to a generalized canonical state at an effective temperature;
whenever the stationary state is present, the equilibrium state of the system
cannot be described by any canonical state anymore. Our finding of the physical
condition on such noncanonical equilibration might have significant impact on
statistical physics. A physical scheme based on circuit QED is proposed to test
our results.

its flavor (vector-like) partner, emerges as a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson
(NGB), ""Top-Mode Pseudo"", together with the exact NGBs to be absorbed into the
W and Z bosons as well as another (heavier) Top-Mode Pseudo (CP-odd composite
scalar). Those five composite (exact/pseudo) NGBs are dynamically produced
simultaneously by a single supercritical four-fermion interaction having U(3) x
U(1) symmetry which includes the electroweak symmetry, where the vacuum is
aligned by small explicit breaking term so as to break the symmetry down to a
subgroup, U(2) x U(1)', in a way not to retain the electroweak symmetry, in
sharp contrast to the little Higgs models. The explicit breaking term for the
vacuum alignment gives rise to a mass of the tHiggs, which is protected by the
symmetry and hence naturally controlled against radiative corrections.
Realistic top quark mass is easily realized similarly to the top-seesaw
mechanism by introducing an extra (subcritical) four-fermion coupling which
explicitly breaks the residual U(2) x U(1)' symmetry. We present a
phenomenological Lagrangian of the Top-Mode Pseudos along with the standard
model particles, which will be useful for the study of the collider
phenomenology. The coupling property of the tHiggs is shown to be consistent
with the currently available data reported from the LHC. Several
phenomenological consequences and constraints from experiments are also
addressed.

radio luminosity correlation for AGNs and occupy the space among, weaker in the
X-rays, FRI objects. (2) The high excitation galaxies (HEG) and low excitation

postulated different origin of the X-ray emission in these two group of

work characterises such atomic scale excitations in terms of their local
structure and environment. It is found that, at zero applied stress, many of
the identified events consist of chain-like excitations that can either be
extended or ring-like in their geometry. The location and activation energy of
these saddle-point structures are found to correlate with the type of atom
involved, and with spatial regions that have low shear moduli and are close to
the excess free volume within the configuration. Such correlations are however
weak and more generally the identified local structural excitations are seen to
exist throughout the model glass sample. The work concludes with a discussion
within the framework of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ relaxation processes that are
known to occur in the under-cooled liquid regime.

different activity phenomena, the first being more sensitive to plage
variation, while the other one being more sensitive to filaments. In this paper
we study the long-term correlation between $\log R'_{HK}$ and $\log
I_{H\alpha}$, two indices based on the Ca II H & K and H$\alpha$ lines
respectively, for a sample of 271 FGK stars using measurements obtained over a
$\sim$9 year time span. Because stellar activity is one of the main obstacles
to the detection of low-mass and long-period planets, understanding further
this activity index correlation can give us some hints about the optimal target
to focus on, and ways to correct for these activity effects. We found a great
variety of long-term correlations between $\log R'_{HK}$ and $\log
I_{H\alpha}$. Around 20% of our sample has strong positive correlation between
the indices while about 3% show strong negative correlation. These fractions
are compatible with those found for the case of early-M dwarfs. Stars
exhibiting a positive correlation have a tendency to be more active when
compared to the median of the sample, while stars showing a negative
correlation are more present among higher metallicity stars. There is also a
tendency for the positively correlated stars to be more present among the
coolest stars, a result which is probably due to the activity level effect on
the correlation. Activity level and metallicity seem therefore to be playing a
role on the correlation between $\log R'_{HK}$ and $\log I_{H\alpha}$. Possible
explanations based on the influence of filaments for the diversity in the
correlations between these indices are discussed in this paper.

with high-mass star formation and compare it with studies on low- and
intermediate-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) using the same methods. The
far-IR line emission and absorption of CO, H$_2$O, OH, and [OI] reveals the
excitation and the relative contribution of different species to the gas
cooling budget. Herschel-PACS spectra covering 55-190 um are analyzed for ten
high-mass star forming regions of various luminosities and evolutionary stages
at spatial scales of ~10^4 AU. Radiative transfer models are used to determine
the contribution of the envelope to the far-IR CO emission.
  The close environments of high-mass YSOs show strong far-IR emission from
molecules, atoms, and ions. Water is detected in all 10 objects even up to high
excitation lines. CO lines from J=14-13 up to typically 29-28 show a single
temperature component, Trot~300 K. Typical H$_2$O temperatures are Trot~250 K,
while OH has Trot~80 K. Far-IR line cooling is dominated by CO (~75 %) and to a
smaller extent by OI (~20 %), which increases for the most evolved sources.
H$_2$O is less important as a coolant for high-mass sources because many lines
are in absorption. Emission from the envelope is responsible for ~45-85 % of
the total CO luminosity in high-mass sources compared with only ~10 % for
low-mass YSOs. The highest-J lines originate most likely from shocks, based on
the strong correlation of CO and H$_2$O with physical parameters of the sources
from low- to high-masses. Excitation of warm CO is very similar for all mass
regimes, whereas H$_2$O temperatures are ~100 K higher for high-mass sources
than the low-mass YSOs. Molecular cooling is ~4 times more important than
cooling by [OI]. The total far-IR line luminosity is about 10$^{-3}$ and
10$^{-5}$ times lower than the dust luminosity for the low- and high-mass YSOs.

N- body simulations by structure finders such as SUBFIND into dark matter
haloes whose formation histories are strictly hierarchical. One advantage of
these `Dhaloes' over the commonly used friends-of-friends (FoF) haloes is that
they retain their individual identity in cases when FoF haloes are artificially
merged by tenuous bridges of particles or by an overlap of their outer diffuse
haloes. Dhaloes are thus well-suited for modelling galaxy formation and their
merger trees form the basis of the Durham semi-analytic galaxy formation model,
GALFORM. Applying the Dhalo construction to the LambdaCDM Millennium-2
simulation we find that approximately 90% of Dhaloes have a one-to-one,
bijective match with a corresponding FoF halo. The remaining 10% are typically
secondary components of large FoF haloes. Although the mass functions of both
types of haloes are similar, the mass of Dhaloes correlates much more tightly
with the virial mass, M200, than FoF haloes. Approximately 80% of FoF and
bijective and non-bijective Dhaloes are relaxed according to standard criteria.
For these relaxed haloes all three types have similar concentration-M200
relations and, at fixed mass, the concentration distributions are described
accurately by log-normal distributions.

business related properties enhance the service description and provide
necessary information about the fitness of its behaviour. These properties have
become crucial criteria for efficient selection and composition of Web

frequently and have to be semantically described. The W3C standard
WSPolicy,recommended to describe these properties doesn t define standardized
specifications that cover all NFPs domains. Moreover, it doesn t provide an
easy manner to express them independently of domains, and doesn t support their
semantic. This paper proposes a Model driven approach to describe and
automatically generate enriched Web services including semantic NFPs. It
explores both the use of the OMG Profile for Modelling and Analysis of

parts of protoplanetary disks, especially at the inner edge and at the
optically surface. To model the transport and resulting effects in detail, it
is necessary to quantify the strength of photophoresis for different particle
classes as a fundamental input. Here, we explore photophoresis for a set of
chondrules. The composition and surface morphology of these chondrules was
measured by X-ray tomography. Based on the three-dimensional models, heat
transfer through illuminated chondrules was calculated. The resulting surface
temperature map was then used to calculate the photophoretic strength. We found
that irregularities in particle shape and variations in composition induce
variations in the photophoretic force. These depend on the orientation of a
particle with respect to the light source. The variations of the absolute value
of the photophoretic force on average over all chondrules is $4.17\%$. The
deviation between the direction of the photophoretic force and illumination is
$3.0^\circ \pm 1.5^\circ$. The average photophoretic force can be well
approximated and calculated analytically assuming a homogeneous sphere with a
volume equivalent mean radius and an effective thermal conductivity. We found
an analytic expression for the effective thermal conductivity. The expression
depends on the two main phases of a chondrule, and decreases with the amount of
fine-grained devitrified, plagioclase-normative mesostasis up to factor of
three. For the chondrule sample studied (Bjurb\""ole chondrite), we found a
dependence of the photophoretic force on chondrule size.

scalar, which can be viewed as a linear realization of general dilaton field.
This new scalar field mixes with the SM Higgs field to form two mass
eigenstates with one of them corresponding to the 125 GeV SM-like Higgs boson
reported by the LHC experiments. In this work, under various theoretical and
experimental constrains, we perform fits to the latest Higgs data and then
investigate the phenomenology of Higgs boson in both the heavy dilaton scenario
and the light dilaton scenario of the MDM. We find that: (i) If one considers
the ATLAS and CMS data separately, the MDM can explain each of them well, but
refer to different parameter space due to the apparent difference in the two
sets of data. If one considers the combined data of the LHC and Tevatron,
however, the explanation given by the MDM is not much better than the SM, and
the dilaton component in the 125-GeV Higgs is less than about 20% at 2 sigma
level. (ii) The current Higgs data have stronger constrains on the light
dilaton scenario than on the heavy dilaton scenario. (iii) The heavy dilaton
scenario can produce a Higgs triple self coupling much larger than the SM
value, and thus a significantly enhanced Higgs pair cross section at hadron
colliders. With a luminosity of 100 fb^{-1} (10 fb^{-1}) at the 14-TeV LHC, a
heavy dilaton of 400 GeV (500 GeV) can be examined. (iv) In the light dilaton
scenario, the Higgs exotic branching ratio can reach 43% (60%) at 2 sigma (3
sigma) level when considering only the CMS data, which may be detected at the
14-TeV LHC with a luminosity of 300 fb^{-1} and the Higgs Factory.

constructing eps-nets to the problem of enumerating lattice points. Our main
technical contribution is a deterministic 2^O(n)-time and poly(n)-space
construction of thin lattice coverings of space with respect to any convex

densification techniques.

can adequately describe recent lattice data for QCD thermodynamics at zero
chemical potential. Different choices for the coupling between the bulk gauge
field and the other bulk fields that define the background (the metric and a
scalar field) are used in order to fit the lattice data for the electric charge
susceptibility $\chi_2^Q/T^2$. The ratio $\sigma_{DC}/T$ is found to vary near
the deconfinement transition in a way that is similar to recent lattice
results. This model is used to compute the charge diffusion coefficient $D$ of
the strongly coupled plasma. We find that the dimensionless combination $DT$
has the same type of temperature dependence displayed by $\sigma_{DC}/T$ and,
thus, charge diffusion is suppressed at low temperatures. The frequency
dependent conductivity $\sigma(\omega)$ reveals some nontrivial structure for
values of the temperature near the phase transition. None of these structures
appear in the associated Euclidean correlator, which we also compute. Our
results suggest that the conformal invariance violation near the QCD
deconfinement phase transition may be seen in the Euclidean correlator through
a downward shift of its value at the minimum, which gives a rough estimate of

partial pose measurements. In contrast to other works, the developed advanced
robot calibration technique is suitable for geometrical and elastostatic
calibration. The main attention is paid to the model parameters identification
accuracy. To reduce the impact of measurement errors, it is proposed to use
directly position measurements of several points instead of computing
orientation of the end-effector. The proposed approach allows us to avoid the
problem of non-homogeneity of the least-square objective, which arises in the
classical identification technique with the full-pose information. The
developed technique does not require any normalization and can be efficiently
applied both for geometric and elastostatic identification. The advantages of a
new approach are confirmed by comparison analysis that deals with the
efficiency evaluation of different identification strategies. The obtained
results have been successfully applied to the elastostatic parameters
identification of the industrial robot employed in a machining work-cell for
aerospace industry.

the reconstruction of a function and its derivatives directly from
observational data, without assuming a specific model or choosing a
parameterization. This is ideal for constraining dark energy because physical
models are generally phenomenological and poorly motivated. Model-independent
constraints on dark energy are an especially important alternative to
parameterized models, as the priors involved have an entirely different source
so can be used to check constraints formulated from models or
parameterizations. A critical prior for Gaussian process reconstruction lies in
the choice of covariance function. We show how the choice of covariance
function affects the result of the reconstruction, and present a choice which
leads to reliable results for present day supernovae data. We also introduce a
method to quantify deviations of a model from the Gaussian process
reconstructions.

argued that approaches based on the infinite sites model are not appropriate to
define $\omega$ for single codon locations. Simple models of amino acid
substitution with reversible mutation and selection are analysed, and used to
define $\omega$ under several evolutionary scenarios. In most practical cases
$\omega<1$ when selection is constant throughout time. However, it is shown
that when the pattern of selection on amino acids changes, for example after an
environment shift, a temporary burst of adaptive evolution ($\omega\gg1$) can
be observed. The fixation probability of a novel mutant under frequency
dependent selection is calculated, and it is used to show why $\omega>1$ can be
sometimes expected for single locations at equilibrium. An example with

to model time evolution of the system, kinetic equations describing time

reduce considerably the number of time-evolution equations. In the simplest

bounds for arithmetic circuits has been proposed. This method combines the
method of {\it depth reduction} developed in the works of Agrawal-Vinay [AV08],
Koiran [Koi12] and Tavenas [Tav13], and the use of the shifted partial
derivative complexity measure developed in the works of Kayal [Kay12] and Gupta

strong lower bounds for various classes of arithmetic circuits, in particular a
recent work of Kayal et al [KSS13] showing superpolynomial lower bounds for
{\it regular} arithmetic formulas via an {\it improved depth reduction} for
these formulas. It was left as an intriguing question if these methods could
prove superpolynomial lower bounds for general (homogeneous) arithmetic
formulas, and if so this would indeed be a breakthrough in arithmetic circuit
complexity.
  In this paper we study the power and limitations of depth reduction and
shifted partial derivatives for arithmetic formulas. We do it via studying the
class of depth 4 homogeneous arithmetic circuits. We show: (1) the first {\it
superpolynomial lower bounds} for the class of homogeneous depth 4 circuits
with top fan-in $o(\log n)$. The core of our result is to show {\it improved
depth reduction} for these circuits. (2) We show that improved depth reduction
{\it is not possible} when the top fan-in is $\Omega(\log n)$. In particular
this shows that the depth reduction procedure of Koiran and Tavenas [Koi12,
Tav13] cannot be improved even for homogeneous formulas, thus strengthening the
results of Fournier et al [FLMS13] who showed that depth reduction is tight for
circuits, and answering some of the main open questions of [KSS13, FLMS13].

was proposed for the first time to produce mega contrast X-ray images for
multi-scale vasculature mapping. Gallium was used as the room temperature
liquid metal contrast agent and perfused into the vessels of in vitro pig
hearts and kidneys. We scanned the samples under X-ray and compared the
angiograms with those obtained via conventional contrast agent--the iohexol. As
quantitatively proved by the gray scale histograms, the contrast of the vessels
to the surrounding tissues in the liquid metal angiograms is orders higher than
that of the iohexol enhanced images. And the resolution of the angiograms has
reached 100{\mu}m, which means the capillaries can be clearly distinguished in
the liquid metal enhanced images. With tomography from the micro-CT, we also
managed to reconstruct the 3-dementional structures of the kidney vessels.
Tremendous clarity and efficiency of the method over existing approaches were
experimentally demonstrated. It was disclosed that the usually invisible
capillary networks now become distinctively clear in the gallium angiograms.
This mechanism can be generalized and extended to a wide spectrum of
3-dimensional computational tomographic areas. It provides a soft tool for
quickly reconstructing high resolution spatial channel networks for scientific
researches or engineering applications where complicated and time consuming

Multi-antenna OFDM-SDMA systems can provide the required high spectral

In this paper, we propose two heuristics to solve the resource allocation
problem that have very low computational complexity and give performances not
far from the optimal. The proposed heuristics select a set of users for each
subchannel, but contrary to the reported methods that solve the throughput
maximization problem, our heuristics consider the set of real-time (RT) users
to ensure that their minimum rate requirements are met. We compare the
heuristics' performance against an upper bound and other methods proposed in
the literature and find that they give a somewhat lower performance, but
support a wider range of minimum rates while reducing the computational
complexity. The gap between the objective achieved by the heuristics and the
upper bound is not large. In our experiments this gap is 10.7% averaging over
all performed numerical evaluations for all system configurations. The increase
in the range of the supported minimum rates when compared with a method
reported in the literature is 14.6% on average.

background of locally rotationally symmetric Bianchi type I universe model. We
formulate the field equations, slow-roll and perturbation parameters (scalar
and tensor power spectra as well as their spectral indices) under slow-roll
approximation. We evaluate all these parameters in terms of directional Hubble
parameter during intermediate and logamediate inflationary regimes by taking
the dissipation factor as a function of scalar field as well as a constant. In
each case, we calculate the observational parameter of interest, i.e.,
tensor-scalar ratio in terms of inflation. The graphical behavior of these
parameters shows that the anisotropic model is also compatible with WMAP7 and
Planck observational data.

  Networks",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we study mobile ad hoc wireless networks using the notion of
evolving connectivity graphs. In such systems, the connectivity changes over
time due to the intermittent contacts of mobile terminals. In particular, we
are interested in studying the expected flooding time when full connectivity
cannot be ensured at each point in time. Even in this case, due to finite
contact times durations, connected components may appear in the connectivity
graph. Hence, this represents the intermediate case between extreme cases of
fully mobile ad hoc networks and fully static ad hoc networks. By using a
generalization of edge-Markovian graphs, we extend the existing models based on
sparse scenarios to this intermediate case and calculate the expected flooding
time. We also propose bounds that have reduced computational complexity.
Finally, numerical results validate our models.

subcarrier allocations that maximize the energy-efficiency (EE) of a
multi-user, multi-relay, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)
cellular network. Initially, the objective function (OF) is formulated as the
ratio of the spectral-efficiency (SE) over the power consumption of the
network. This OF is shown to be quasi-concave, thus Dinkelbach's method can be
employed for solving it as a series of parameterized concave problems. We
characterize the performance of the aforementioned method by comparing the
optimal solutions obtained to those found using an exhaustive search.
Additionally, we explore the relationship between the achievable SE and EE in
the cellular network upon increasing the number of active users. In general,
increasing the number of users supported by the system benefits both the SE and
EE, and higher SE values may be obtained at the cost of EE, when an increased
power may be allocated.

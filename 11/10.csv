opportunity for detailed temporal analysis of the prompt optical emission. With
a two-component distribution of initial Lorentz factors, we simulate the
dynamical process of the ejected shells from the central engine in the
framework of the internal shock model. The emitted radiation are decomposed
into different frequency ranges for a temporal correlation analysis between the
lightcurves in different energy bands. The resulting prompt optical and
gamma-ray emission show similar temporal profiles, both as a superposition of a
slow variability component and a fast variability component, except that the
gamma-ray lightcurve is much more variable than its optical counterpart. The
variability features in the simulated lightcurves and the strong correlation
with a time lag between the optical and gamma-ray emission are in good
agreement with the observations of GRB 080319B. Our simulations suggest that
the variations seen in the lightcurves stem from the temporal structure of the
shells injected from the central engine of gamma-ray bursts. The future high
temporal resolution observations of prompt optical emission from GRBs, e.g., by
UFFO-Pathfinder and SVOM-GWAC, provide a useful tool to investigate the central
engine activity.

of points into a simple, usually flat, domain. The points are assumed to be
sampled from some metric space, and the mapping attempts to preserve the
distances between each pair of points in the set. Distances in the target space
can be computed analytically in this setting. Generalized MDS is an extension
that allows mapping one metric space into another, that is, multidimensional
scaling into target spaces in which distances are evaluated numerically rather
than analytically. Here, we propose an efficient approach for computing such
mappings between surfaces based on their natural spectral decomposition, where
the surfaces are treated as sampled metric-spaces. The resulting spectral-GMDS
procedure enables efficient embedding by implicitly incorporating smoothness of
the mapping into the problem, thereby substantially reducing the complexity
involved in its solution while practically overcoming its non-convex nature.
The method is compared to existing techniques that compute dense correspondence
between shapes. Numerical experiments of the proposed method demonstrate its
efficiency and accuracy compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

ionization properties of different regions in Mrk 996 are correlated with their
kinematic properties. From the maps, we can spatially distinguish a very dense
high-ionization zone with broad lines in the nuclear region, and a less dense
low-ionization zone with narrow lines in the circumnuclear region. Four
kinematically distinct systems of lines are identified in the integrated
spectrum of Mrk 996, suggesting stellar wind outflows from a population of
Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in the nuclear region, superposed on an underlying
rotation pattern. From the intensities of the blue and red bumps, we derive a
population of $\sim$473 late nitrogen (WNL) stars and $\sim$98 early carbon
(WCE) stars in the nucleus of Mrk 996, resulting in a high N(WR)/N(O+WR) of
0.19. We derive, for the outer narrow-line region, an oxygen abundance
12+log(O/H)=7.94$\pm$0.30 ($\sim$ 0.2 Z$_\odot$) by using the direct T$_e$
method derived from the detected narrow [OIII]$\lambda$4363 line. The nucleus
of Mrk 996 is, however, nitrogen-enhanced by a factor of $\sim$20, in agreement
with previous CLOUDY modeling. This nitrogen enhancement is probably due to
nitrogen-enriched WR ejecta, but also to enhanced nitrogen line emission in a
high-density environment. Although we have made use here of two new methods -
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) tomography and a method for mapping low- and
high-density clouds - to analyze our data, new methodology is needed to further
exploit the wealth of information.

star formation process, infall motions have been always elusive to detect. So
far, only a few observational signatures have been commonly used to claim for
the presence of infall. Often these features consist in either
""blue-asymmetries"" or absorption at red-shifted velocities (e.g., inverse
P-Cygni profiles). Both signatures are based only on the shape of the line
profile and they do not guarantee by themselves the presence of dominant infall
motions. More robust ""mapping signatures"" can be obtained from images that
angularly resolve the infalling gas. Here we present VLA observations of the
ammonia inversion transitions (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), and (6,6) towards the
hot molecular core (HMC) near G31.41+0.31 that show the signatures of
protostellar infall theoretically predicted by Anglada et al. (1991). The
intensity of the ammonia emission is compact and sharply increases towards the
centre in the blue-shifted velocity channel maps, while it shows a more
flattened distribution in the red-shifted velocity channels. Additionally, the
emission becomes more compact with increasing (relative) velocity for both red
and blue-shifted channels. We introduce a new infall signature, the ""central
blue spot"", easily identifiable in the first-order moment maps. We show that
rotation produces an additional, independent signature, making the distribution
of the emission in the channel maps asymmetric with respect to the central
position, but without masking the infall signatures. All these mapping
signatures, which are identified here for the first time, are present in the
observed ammonia transitions of G31 HMC.

described by a thermal state (within the accuracy of our approximation).
However, the (quasi) equilibrium state of the reduced density matrices for two
sites including the correlations cannot be described by a thermal state. Thus,
real thermalization (if it occurs) should take much longer time. This behavior
has already been observed in other scenarios and is sometimes called
``pre-thermalization.'' Finally, we compare our results to numerical

It is observed in numerous bacterial species that individual cells can
stochastically switch among multiple phenotypes for the population to survive
in rapidly changing environments. This kind of phenotypic heterogeneity with
stochastic phenotype switching is generally understood to be an adaptive
bet-hedging strategy. Mathematical models are essential to gain a deeper
insight into the principle behind bet-hedging and the pattern behind
experimental data. Traditional deterministic models cannot provide a correct
description of stochastic phenotype switching and bet-hedging, and traditional
Markov chain models at the cellular level fail to explain their underlying
molecular mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear stochastic model of
multistable bacterial systems at the molecular level. It turns out that our
model not only provides a clear description of stochastic phenotype switching
and bet-hedging within isogenic bacterial populations, but also provides a
deeper insight into the analysis of multidimensional experimental data.
Moreover, we use some deep mathematical theories to show that our stochastic
model and traditional Markov chain models are essentially consistent and
reflect the dynamic behavior of the bacterial system at two different time
scales. In addition, we provide a quantitative characterization of the critical
state of multistable bacterial systems and develop an effective data-driven
method to identify the critical state without resorting to specific
mathematical models.

generation of emulsions composed of uniformly sized drops of micrometric or
submicrometric diameters when two immiscible streams flow in parallel under the
so-called tip streaming regime after Suryo & Basaran (2006). Indeed, when
inertial effects in both liquid streams are negligible, the inner to outer
flow-rate and viscosity ratios are small enough and the capillary number is
above an experimentally determined threshold which is predicted by our
theoretical results with small relative errors, a steady micron-sized jet is
issued from the apex of a conical drop. Under these conditions, the jet
disintegrates into drops with a very well defined mean diameter, giving rise to
a monodisperse micro-emulsion. Here, we demonstrate that the regime in which
uniformly-sized drops are produced corresponds to values of the capillary
number for which the cone-jet system is globally stable. Interestingly enough,
our general stability theory reveals that liquid jets with a cone-jet structure
are much more stable than their cylindrical counterparts thanks, mostly, to a
capillary stabilization mechanism described here for the first time. Our
findings also limit the validity of the type of stability analysis based on the
common parallel flow assumption to only those situations in which the liquid
jet diameter is almost constant.

Raman peak from the Si substrate and the E2g peak of TaSe2 presents a
convenient metric for quantifying film thickness. The temperature coefficients
for two main Raman peaks, A1g and E2g, are -0.013 and -0.0097 cm-1/oC,
respectively. The Raman optothermal measurements indicate that the room
temperature thermal conductivity in these films decreases from its bulk value
of ~16 W/mK to ~9 W/mK in 45-nm thick films. The measurement of electrical
resistivity of the field-effect devices with TaSe2 channels indicates that heat
conduction is dominated by acoustic phonons in these van der Waals films. The
scaling of thermal conductivity with the film thickness suggests that the
phonon scattering from the film boundaries is substantial despite the sharp
interfaces of the mechanically cleaved samples. These results are important for
understanding the thermal properties of thin films exfoliated from TaSe2 and
other metal dichalcogenides, as well as for evaluating self-heating effects in
devices made from such materials.

Ionization-parameter mapping provides a simple, yet effective, way to study the
radiative transfer in starburst galaxies. We obtain emission-line ratio maps of
[SIII]/[SII] for six, nearby, dwarf starbursts: NGC 178, NGC 1482, NGC 1705,
NGC 3125, NGC 7126, and He 2-10. The narrow-band images are obtained with the
Maryland-Magellan Tunable Filter at Las Campanas Observatory. Using these data,
we previously reported the discovery of an optically thin ionization cone in
NGC 5253, and here we also discover a similar ionization cone in NGC 3125. This
latter cone has an opening angle of 40+/-5 degrees (0.4 ster), indicating that
the passageways through which ionizing radiation may travel correspond to a
small solid angle. Additionally, there are three sample galaxies that have
winds and/or superbubble activity, which should be conducive to escaping
radiation, yet they are optically thick. These results support the scenario
that an orientation bias limits our ability to directly detect escaping Lyman
continuum in many starburst galaxies. A comparison of the star-formation
properties and histories of the optically thin and thick galaxies is consistent
with the model that high escape fractions are limited to galaxies that are old
enough (> 3 Myr) for mechanical feedback to have cleared optically thin
passageways in the ISM, but young enough (< 5 Myr) that the ionizing stars are

essentially that mathematics is difficult. Third-graders are not
developmentally ready for the subtlety of fractions, for instance, and even
high-performing students cannot be expected to develop the skills of

less effective than the version employed by experienced users. Experts discard
at least 90% of what is taught in schools. Our educational system is actually
counterproductive for skill development, and the reasons for this are an

used in many applications, and the trade-off between the modeling capacity and
the efficiency of learning and inference has been an important research
problem. In this paper, we study the family of GGMs with small feedback vertex
sets (FVSs), where an FVS is a set of nodes whose removal breaks all the
cycles. Exact inference such as computing the marginal distributions and the
partition function has complexity $O(k^{2}n)$ using message-passing algorithms,
where k is the size of the FVS, and n is the total number of nodes. We propose
efficient structure learning algorithms for two cases: 1) All nodes are
observed, which is useful in modeling social or flight networks where the FVS
nodes often correspond to a small number of high-degree nodes, or hubs, while
the rest of the networks is modeled by a tree. Regardless of the maximum
degree, without knowing the full graph structure, we can exactly compute the
maximum likelihood estimate in $O(kn^2+n^2\log n)$ if the FVS is known or in
polynomial time if the FVS is unknown but has bounded size. 2) The FVS nodes
are latent variables, where structure learning is equivalent to decomposing a
inverse covariance matrix (exactly or approximately) into the sum of a
tree-structured matrix and a low-rank matrix. By incorporating efficient
inference into the learning steps, we can obtain a learning algorithm using
alternating low-rank correction with complexity $O(kn^{2}+n^{2}\log n)$ per
iteration. We also perform experiments using both synthetic data as well as
real data of flight delays to demonstrate the modeling capacity with FVSs of
various sizes.

choice to achieve constrained simulations of the Local Universe reliable down
to a scale of a few Megaparsecs. Unlike redshift surveys, peculiar velocities
are direct tracers of the underlying gravitational field as they trace both
baryonic and dark matter. This paper presents the first attempt to use solely
observational peculiar velocities to constrain cosmological simulations of the
nearby universe. In order to set up Initial Conditions, a Reverse Zel'dovich
Approximation (RZA) is used to displace constraints from their positions at z=0
to their precursors' locations at higher redshifts. An additional new feature
replaces original observed radial peculiar velocity vectors by their full 3D
reconstructions provided by the Wiener-Filter (WF) estimator. Subsequently, the
Constrained Realization of Gaussian fields technique (CR) is applied to build
various realizations of the Initial Conditions. The WF/RZA/CR method is first
tested on realistic mock catalogs built from a reference simulation similar to
the Local Universe. These mocks include errors on peculiar velocities, on
data-point positions and a large continuous zone devoid of data in order to
mimic galactic extinction. Large scale structures are recovered with a typical
accuracy of 5 Megaparsecs/h in position, the best realizations reaching a 2-3
Mpc/h precision, the limit imposed by the RZA linear theory. Then, the method
is applied to the first observational radial peculiar velocity catalog of the
project Cosmicflows. This paper is a proof of concept that the WF/RZA/CR method
can be applied to observational peculiar velocities to successfully build
constrained Initial Conditions.

quantum-bit-oscillator system. Under dynamical decoupling control of the
quantum bit (qubit), the qubit coherence exhibits a comb structure in time
domain. The time-comb structure enables high precision measurement of
oscillator frequency, which can be used as an ultra-sensitive mass
spectrometer. Surprisingly, in ideal case, the sensitivity of the proposed mass
spectrometer, which scales with the temperature $T$ as $T^{-1/2}$, has better
performance in higher temperature. While taking into account qubit and
oscillator decay, we show that the optimal sensitivity is independent on
environmental temperature $T$. With present technology on solid state spin
qubit and high-quality optomechanical system, our proposal is feasible to
realize an ultra-sensitive mass spectrometer in room temperature.

  vectors","13 pages",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The increased availability of data in recent years has led several authors to
ask whether it is possible to use data as a {\em computational} resource. That
is, if more data is available, beyond the sample complexity limit, is it
possible to use the extra examples to speed up the computation time required to
perform the learning task?
  We give the first positive answer to this question for a {\em natural
supervised learning problem} --- we consider agnostic PAC learning of
halfspaces over $3$-sparse vectors in $\{-1,1,0\}^n$. This class is
inefficiently learnable using $O\left(n/\epsilon^2\right)$ examples. Our main
contribution is a novel, non-cryptographic, methodology for establishing
computational-statistical gaps, which allows us to show that, under a widely
believed assumption that refuting random $\mathrm{3CNF}$ formulas is hard, it
is impossible to efficiently learn this class using only
$O\left(n/\epsilon^2\right)$ examples. We further show that under stronger
hardness assumptions, even $O\left(n^{1.499}/\epsilon^2\right)$ examples do not
suffice. On the other hand, we show a new algorithm that learns this class
efficiently using $\tilde{\Omega}\left(n^2/\epsilon^2\right)$ examples. This
formally establishes the tradeoff between sample and computational complexity
for a natural supervised learning problem.

determine which hypothesis classes are efficiently learnable. There is
presently a dearth of results showing hardness of learning problems. Moreover,
the existing lower bounds fall short of the best known algorithms.
  The biggest challenge in proving complexity results is to establish hardness
of {\em improper learning} (a.k.a. representation independent learning).The
difficulty in proving lower bounds for improper learning is that the standard
reductions from $\mathbf{NP}$-hard problems do not seem to apply in this
context. There is essentially only one known approach to proving lower bounds
on improper learning. It was initiated in (Kearns and Valiant 89) and relies on
cryptographic assumptions.
  We introduce a new technique for proving hardness of improper learning, based
on reductions from problems that are hard on average. We put forward a (fairly
strong) generalization of Feige's assumption (Feige 02) about the complexity of
refuting random constraint satisfaction problems. Combining this assumption
with our new technique yields far reaching implications. In particular,
  1. Learning $\mathrm{DNF}$'s is hard.
  2. Agnostically learning halfspaces with a constant approximation ratio is
hard.
  3. Learning an intersection of $\omega(1)$ halfspaces is hard.

we find that although the Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit (BGS) conjecture seems to be
valid, it does not exhibit true signatures of quantum chaos. However
contrasting conjecture of Berry and Tabor is observed with smaller cluster
size. For small number of bosons, we observe the existence of large number of
quasi-degenerate states in low-lying excitation which exhibits the Shnirelman
peak in $P(s)$ distribution. We also find a narrow region of intermediate
spectrum which can be described by semi-Poisson statistics whereas the higher
levels are regular and exhibit Poisson statistics. These observations are
further supported by the analysis of the distribution of the ratio of
consecutive level spacings $P(r)$ which is independent of unfolding procedure
and thereby provides a tool for more transparent comparison with experimental
findings than $P(s)$. Thus our detail numerical study clearly shows that the
van der Waals clusters become more correlated with the increase in cluster

we consider to be inertial motion as well as what constitutes an inertial frame
of reference in flat space-time. We adopt none of the features of our current
cosmological models except for the requirement that special and general
relativity be local approximations within our revised definition of inertial
systems. Implicit in our ideas is the assumption that at ""large enough"" scales
one can treat objects within these inertial systems as point-particles having
an insignificant effect on the curvature of space-time. We then proceed under
the assumption that time and space are fundamentally intertwined such that
time- and spatial-translational invariance are not inherent symmetries of flat
space-time (i.e. observable clock rates depend upon both relative velocity and
spatial position within these inertial systems) and take the geodesics of this
theory in the radial Rindler chart as the proper characterization of inertial
motion. With this commitment, we are able to model solely with inertial motion
the observed effects expected to be the result of `dark energy', `dark matter',
and `dark flow'. In addition, we examine the potential observable implications
of our theory in a gravitational system located within a confined region of an
inertial reference frame, subsequently interpreting the Pioneer anomaly as
support for our redefinition of inertial motion. As well, we extend our
analysis into quantum mechanics by quantizing for a real scalar field and find
a possible explanation for the asymmetry between matter and antimatter within

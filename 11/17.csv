implied leverage (i.e. the correlation of the at-the-money volatility with the
returns of the underlying) and the skew of the option smile. The ratio between
these two quantities, called ``Skew-Stickiness Ratio'' (SSR) by Bergomi (Smile
Dynamics IV, RISK, 94-100, December 2009), saturates to the value 2 for linear
models in the limit of small maturities, and converges to 1 for long
maturities. We show that for more general, non-linear models (such as the
asymmetric GARCH model), Bergomi's result must be modified, and can be larger
than 2 for small maturities. The discrepancy comes from the fact that the
volatility skew is, in general, different from the skewness of the underlying.
We compare our theory with empirical results, using data both from option
markets and from the underlying price series, for the S&P500 and the DAX. We
find, among other things, that although both the implied leverage and the skew
appear to be too strong on option markets, their ratio is well explained by the

recent theory of invariant recognition by feedforward hierarchical networks,

implies an alternative approach to unconstrained face recognition. This
approach accomplishes detection and alignment implicitly by storing
transformations of training images (called templates) rather than explicitly
detecting and aligning faces at test time. Here we propose a particular
locality-sensitive hashing based voting scheme which we call ""consensus of

unconstrained face recognition operates on photographs of faces taken under
natural conditions, e.g., Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW), without aligning or
cropping them, as is normally done. It achieves a drastic improvement in the
state of the art on this end-to-end task, reaching the same level of
performance as the best systems operating on aligned, closely cropped images
(no outside training data). It also performs well on two newer datasets,

estimation methods are investigated and compared. On the one hand, the maximum
likelihood estimator (MLE) takes into account the full measurement data and is
asymptotically optimal in terms of its mean square error. On the other hand,
the `likelihood-free' method of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) produces
an approximation of the posterior distribution for a given set of summary
statistics, by sampling trajectories at different parameter values and
comparing them with the measurement data via chosen statistics.
  Our analysis is performed on the atom maser model, which exhibits interesting
features such as bistability and dynamical phase transitions, and has
connections with the classical theory of hidden Markov processes. Building on
previous results which showed that atom counts are poor statistics for certain
values of the Rabi angle, we apply MLE to the full measurement data and
estimate its Fisher information. We then select several correlation statistics
such as waiting times, distribution of successive identical detections, and use
them as input of the ABC algorithm. The resulting posterior distribution
follows closely the data likelihood, showing that the selected statistics

physics includes: (1) The model employs three different temperatures, namely
the isotropic electron temperature and the parallel and perpendicular ion
temperatures. The firehose, mirror, and ion-cyclotron instabilities due to the
developing ion temperature anisotropy are accounted for. (2) The Alfven waves
are partially reflected by the Alfven speed gradient and the vorticity along
the field lines. The resulting counter-propagating waves are responsible for
the nonlinear turbulent cascade. The balanced turbulence due to uncorrelated
waves near the apex of the closed field lines and the resulting elevated
temperatures are addressed. (3) To apportion the wave dissipation to the three
temperatures, we employ the results of the theories of linear wave damping and
nonlinear stochastic heating. (4) We have incorporated the collisional and
collisionless electron heat conduction. We compare the simulated

the mean time to data loss (MTTDL), depends on the repair bandwidth of the
code. Repair-efficient codes provide reliability values several orders of
magnitude better than conventional erasure codes. Current state of the art
codes fix the number of helper nodes (nodes participating in repair) a priori.
In practice, however, it is desirable to allow the number of helper nodes to be
adaptively determined by the network traffic conditions. In this work, we
propose an opportunistic repair framework to address this issue. It is shown
that there exists a threshold on the storage overhead, below which such an
opportunistic approach does not lose any efficiency from the optimal
storage-repair-bandwidth tradeoff; i.e. it is possible to construct a code
simultaneously optimal for different numbers of helper nodes. We further
examine the benefits of such opportunistic codes, and derive the MTTDL
improvement for two repair models: one with limited total repair bandwidth and
the other with limited individual-node repair bandwidth. In both settings, we
show orders of magnitude improvement in MTTDL. Finally, the proposed framework
is examined in a network setting where a significant improvement in MTTDL is
observed.

We observed Vela X-1 in 2010 and 2012 using long baseline interferometry at
VLTI, respectively with the AMBER instrument in the K band and the PIONIER
instrument in the H band. The PIONIER observations span through one orbital
period to monitor possible evolutions in the geometry of the system. We
resolved a structure of $8\pm3~R_\star$ from the AMBER data and
$2.0\,_{-1.2}^{+0.7}~R_\star$ from the PIONIER data. From the closure phase we
found that the environment of Vela X-1 is symmetrical. We observed comparable
measurements between the continuum and the spectral lines in the K band,
meaning that both emissions originate from the same forming region. From the
monitoring of the system over one period in 2012, we found the signal to be
constant with the orbital phase within the error bars. We propose three
scenarios for the discrepancy between the two measurements: either there is a
strong temperature gradient in the supergiant wind leading to a hot component
much more compact than the cool part of the wind observed in the K band, or we
observed a diffuse shell in 2010 possibly triggered by an off-state in the

a receiver harvests energy from a wireless power transmitter to power itself
for various applications. The transmitter performs energy beamforming by using
an instantaneous channel state information (CSI). The CSI is estimated at the
receiver by training via a preamble, and fed back to the transmitter. The
channel estimate is more accurate when longer preamble is used, but less time
is left for wireless power transfer before the channel changes. To maximize the
harvested energy, in this paper, we address the key challenge of balancing the
time resource used for channel estimation and wireless power transfer (WPT),
and also investigate the allocation of energy resource used for wireless power
transfer. First, we consider the general scenario where the preamble length is
allowed to vary dynamically. Taking into account the effects of imperfect CSI,
the optimal preamble length is obtained online by solving a dynamic programming
(DP) problem. The solution is shown to be a threshold-type policy that depends
only on the channel estimate power. Next, we consider the scenario in which the
preamble length is fixed. The optimal preamble length is optimized offline.
Furthermore, we derive the optimal power allocation schemes for both scenarios.
For the scenario of dynamic-length preamble, the power is allocated according
to both the optimal preamble length and the channel estimate power; while for
the scenario of fixed-length preamble, the power is allocated according to only
the channel estimate power. The analysis results are validated by numerical
simulations. Encouragingly, with optimal power allocation, the harvested energy
by using optimized fixed-length preamble is almost the same as the harvested
energy by employing dynamic-length preamble, hence allowing a low-complexity
WPT system to be implemented in practice.

""planted partition model"" in theoretical computer science. In its simplest
form, this is a random graph with two equal-sized clusters, with a
between-class edge probability of $q$ and a within-class edge probability of
$p$.
  A striking conjecture of Decelle, Krzkala, Moore and Zdeborov\'a based on
deep, non-rigorous ideas from statistical physics, gave a precise prediction
for the algorithmic threshold of clustering in the sparse planted partition
model. In particular, if $p = a/n$ and $q = b/n$, $s=(a-b)/2$ and $p=(a+b)/2$
then Decelle et al.\ conjectured that it is possible to efficiently cluster in
a way correlated with the true partition if $s^2 > p$ and impossible if $s^2 <
p$. By comparison, the best-known rigorous result is that of Coja-Oghlan, who
showed that clustering is possible if $s^2 > C p \ln p$ for some sufficiently
large $C$.
  In a previous work, we proved that indeed it is information theoretically
impossible to to cluster if $s^2 < p$ and furthermore it is information
theoretically impossible to even estimate the model parameters from the graph
when $s^2 < p$. Here we complete the proof of the conjecture by providing an
efficient algorithm for clustering in a way that is correlated with the true
partition when $s^2 > p$. A different independent proof of the same result was
recently obtained by Laurent Massoulie.

chimney samples were obtained from active hydrothermal systems by submersible
vehicles: one was natural chimney (NC) on a hydrothermal natural vent; the
other was artificial chimneys (AC), mainly formed by the growth and deposition
of sulfide-rich particulate components in a Kuwabara-type in situ incubator (KI
incubator). Total hydrolyzed amino acids (THAA) and hydrolyzed hexosamines (HA)
in AC ranged from 10.7 nmol/g to 64.0 nmol/g and from 0 nmol/g to 8.1 nmol/g,
respectively, while THAA in hydrothermally altered core samples ranged from
26.0 nmol/g to 107.4 nmol/g-rock. The THAA was thus of the same order of
magnitude in AC and core samples. The representative biochemical indicator
ratios of {\beta}-alanine/aspartic acid and {\gamma}-aminobutyric acid/glutamic
acid were low. This is consistent with a large microbial population and labile
subterranean biogenic organic compounds. A micro energy dispersive X-ray
spectrometer ({\mu}EDX) was used to show that the formation of massive pyrite-

were processed during hydrothermal activity. These data suggest that labile
particulate organic matter (POM) and/or dissolved organic matter (DOM) from
hydrothermal fluid were continuously trapped to form concentrated organic
matter in a sulfide-rich matrix.

governing potential is simply the convolution of an interaction kernel $U(\bx)$
and a density function $\rho(\bx)=|\psi(\bx)|^2$, for some complex-valued wave
function $\psi(\bx)$, permitting the formal use of Fourier methods. These are
hampered by the fact that the Fourier transform of the interaction kernel
$\widehat{U}(\bk)$ has a singularity at the origin $\bk={\bf 0}$ in Fourier
(phase) space. Thus, accuracy is lost when using a uniform Cartesian grid in
$\bk$ which would otherwise permit the use of the FFT for evaluating the
convolution. Here, we make use of a high-order discretization of the Fourier
integral, accelerated by the nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT). By
adopting spherical and polar phase-space discretizations in three and two
dimensions, respectively, the singularity in $\hat{U}(\bk)$ at the origin is
canceled, so that only a modest number of degrees of freedom are required to
evaluate the Fourier integral, assuming that the density function $\rho(\bx)$
is smooth and decays sufficiently fast as $\bx \rightarrow \infty$. More
precisely, the calculation requires $O(N\log N)$ operations, where $N$ is the
total number of discretization points in the computational domain. Numerical
examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of the algorithm.

the disease will eventually stabilize at either a disease-free state or an

recurrent behaviour in one region because of the invasion from an endemic
population elsewhere. In this paper we address this issue and study a
susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemiological model on a network consisting
of two communities, where the disease is endemic in one community but
alternates between outbreaks and extinctions in the other. We provide a
detailed characterization of the temporal dynamics of epidemic patterns in the
latter community. In particular, we investigate the time duration of both
outbreak and extinction, and the time interval between two consecutive
inter-community infections, as well as their frequency distributions. Based on
the mean-field theory, we theoretically analyze these three timescales and
their dependence on the average node degree of each community, the transmission
parameters, and the number of intercommunity links, which are in good agreement
with simulations, except when the probability of overlaps between successive
outbreaks is too large. These findings aid us in better understanding the
bursty nature of disease spreading in a local community, and thereby suggesting
effective time-dependent control strategies.

gradient torque of spacecraft around asteroids by taking into consideration of
the inertia integrals of the spacecraft up to the fourth order, which is an
improvement of the previous fourth-order model of the gravity gradient torque.
Design, methodology and approach: The fourth-order gravitational potential of
the spacecraft is derived based on Taylor expansion. Then the expression of the
gravity gradient torque in terms of gravitational potential derivatives is
derived. By using the formulation of the gravitational potential, explicit
formulations of the full fourth-order gravity gradient torque are obtained.
Then a numerical simulation is carried out to verify our model. Findings: We
find that our model is more sound and precise than the previous fourth-order
model due to the consideration of higher-order inertia integrals of the
spacecraft. Numerical simulation results show that the motion of the previous
fourth-order model is quite different from the exact motion, while our full
fourth-order model fits the exact motion very well. Our full fourth-order model
is precise enough for high-precision attitude dynamics and control around
asteroids. Practical implications: This high-precision model is of importance
for the future asteroids missions for scientific explorations and near-Earth
objects mitigation. Originality and value: In comparison with the previous
model, a gravity gradient torque model around asteroids that is more sound and
precise is established. This model is valuable for high-precision attitude
dynamics and control around asteroids.

of classical noisy environments. In our scheme a qubit interacts with a
classical stochastic field describing environmental noise and is then measured
after a given interaction time in order to estimate the characteristic
parameters of the noise. In particular, we address estimation of the spectral
parameters of two relevant kinds of non-Gaussian noise: random telegraph noise
with Lorentzian spectrum and colored noise with $1/f^{\alpha}$ spectrum. We
discuss the estimation precision achievable by quantum probes by analyzing in
details the behavior of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) as a function of
the noise and the other parameters. We found that population measurement on the
qubit is optimal for noise estimation and also evaluate the optimal interaction
times for the quantum probe, i.e. the values maximizing the QFI and the quantum
signal-to-noise ratio. For random telegraph noise the QFI is inversely
proportional to the square of the switching rate, meaning that the quantum
signal-to-noise ratio is constant and thus the switching rate may be uniformly
estimated with the same precision in its whole range of variation. For colored
noise, the precision achievable in the estimation of ``color'', i.e. of the
exponent $\alpha$, strongly depends on the structure of the environment, i.e.
on the number of fluctuators describing the classical environment. For an
environment modeled by a single random fluctuator estimation is more precise
for pink noise, i.e. for $\alpha=1$, whereas by increasing the number of
fluctuators, the QFI is has two local maxima, with the largest one drifting
towards $\alpha=2$, i.e. brown noise.

outer ring structures. In the vast majority of cases, the outer structures lie
in the plane close to polar (within 10-20 deg) which indicates the stability of
the corresponding orbits in the gravitational potential of the halo. Moderately
inclined outer structures are observed only in about 6% of objects which
probably indicates their short lifetime. In such an unstable configuration, the
polar ring would often cross the disk of the galaxy, being smaller than it in
the diameter. We show that the inner polar structures and outer large-scale
polar rings form a single family in the distribution of diameters normalized to
the optical size of the galaxy. At the same time, this distribution is bimodal,
as the number of objects with d_ring= (0.4-0.7)*d_disk is negligible. Such a
shape of size distribution is most likely due to the fact that the stability of
polar orbits in the inner regions of galaxies is maintained by the bulge or the
bar, while in the outer regions it is provided by the spheroidal (or triaxial)
halo.

eliminating the unstable degrees of freedom in the full nonlinear theory. All
the other theories of quadratic type are unstable -- a problem appearing as
ghost modes in the linearized theory.
  We find that the full projection of the Weyl tensor onto a three-dimensional
hypersurface contains an additional fully traceless component, given by a
quadratic extrinsic curvature tensor. A certain inconsistency in the literature
is found and resolved: when the conformal invariance of Weyl gravity is broken
by a cosmological constant term, the theory becomes pathological, since a
constraint required by the Hamiltonian analysis imposes the determinant of the
metric of spacetime to be zero. In order to resolve this problem by restoring
the conformal invariance, we introduce a new scalar field that couples to the
curvature of spacetime, reminiscent of the introduction of vector fields for
ensuring the gauge invariance.

algorithms relying on large sets of labeled examples ($n \to \infty$). The next
phase is likely to focus on algorithms capable of learning from very few
labeled examples ($n \to 1$), like humans seem able to do. We propose an
approach to this problem and describe the underlying theory, based on the
unsupervised, automatic learning of a ``good'' representation for supervised
learning, characterized by small sample complexity ($n$). We consider the case
of visual object recognition though the theory applies to other domains. The
starting point is the conjecture, proved in specific cases, that image
representations which are invariant to translations, scaling and other
transformations can considerably reduce the sample complexity of learning. We
prove that an invariant and unique (discriminative) signature can be computed
for each image patch, $I$, in terms of empirical distributions of the
dot-products between $I$ and a set of templates stored during unsupervised
learning. A module performing filtering and pooling, like the simple and
complex cells described by Hubel and Wiesel, can compute such estimates.
Hierarchical architectures consisting of this basic Hubel-Wiesel moduli inherit
its properties of invariance, stability, and discriminability while capturing
the compositional organization of the visual world in terms of wholes and
parts. The theory extends existing deep learning convolutional architectures
for image and speech recognition. It also suggests that the main computational
goal of the ventral stream of visual cortex is to provide a hierarchical
representation of new objects/images which is invariant to transformations,
stable, and discriminative for recognition---and that this representation may
be continuously learned in an unsupervised way during development and visual
experience.

Hard X-rays provide us with a view of the innermost regions of AGN, mostly
unbiased by absorption along the line of sight. Swift/BAT offers the unique
opportunity to follow, on time scales of days to years and with a regular
sampling, the 14-195 keV emission of the largest AGN sample available up to
date for this kind of investigation. We study the amplitude of the variations,
and their dependence on sub-class and on energy, for a sample of 110 radio
quiet and radio loud AGN selected from the BAT 58-month survey. About 80% of
the AGN in the sample are found to exhibit significant variability on months to
years time scales, radio loud sources being the most variable. The amplitude of
the variations and their energy dependence are incompatible with variability
being driven at hard X-rays by changes of the absorption column density. In
general, the variations in the 14-24 and 35-100 keV bands are well correlated,
suggesting a common origin of the variability across the BAT energy band.
However, radio quiet AGN display on average 10% larger variations at 14-24 keV
than at 35-100 keV and a softer-when-brighter behavior for most of the Seyfert
galaxies with detectable spectral variability on month time scale. In addition,
sources with harder spectra are found to be more variable than softer ones.
These properties are generally consistent with a variable power law continuum,
in flux and shape, pivoting at energies >~ 50 keV, to which a constant
reflection component is superposed. When the same time scales are considered,
the timing properties of AGN at hard X-rays are comparable to those at lower
energies, with at least some of the differences possibly ascribable to
components contributing differently in the two energy domains (e.g.,
reflection, absorption).

purpose of TAPAS output is to allow identification of observed spectral
features as being from atmospheric or astrophysical origin. The returned

scale and Instrument Line Spectral Function (ILSF) by comparing one observed
spectrum of an atmospheric feature to the transmission. Finally, the TOA (Top

solving large-scale engineering acoustic problems in a broad frequency range is
developed and implemented. The acoustic problems are modeled by the
Burton-Miller boundary integral equation (BIE), thus the fictitious frequency
issue is completely avoided. The BIE is discretized by using the Nystr\""om
method based on the curved quadratic elements, leading to simple numerical
implementation (no edge or corner problems) and high accuracy in the BEM
analysis. The linear systems are solved iteratively and accelerated by using a
newly developed kernel-independent wideband fast directional algorithm (FDA)
for fast summation of oscillatory kernels. In addition, the computational
efficiency of the FDA is further promoted by exploiting the low-rank features
of the translation matrices, resulting in two- to three-fold reduction in the
computational time of the multipole-to-local translations. The high accuracy
and nearly linear computational complexity of the present method are clearly
demonstrated by typical examples. An acoustic scattering problem with
dimensionless wave number $kD$ (where $k$ is the wave number and $D$ is the
typical length of the obstacle) up to 1000 and the degrees of freedom up to 4

  Analysis","25 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables; comments welcome",,,,"physics.soc-ph physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Number Pieces are a corpus of works by composer John Cage, which rely on
a particular time-structure used for determining the temporal location of
sounds, named the ""time-bracket"". The time-bracket system is an inherently
stochastic process, which complicates the analysis of the Number Pieces as it
leads to a large number of possibilities in terms of sonic content instead of
one particular fixed performance. The purpose of this paper is to propose a
statistical approach of the Number Pieces by assimilating them to stochastic
processes. Two Number Pieces, ""Four"" and ""Five"", are studied here in terms of
pitch-class set content: the stochastic processes at hand lead to a collection
of random variables indexed over time giving the distribution of the possible
pitch-class sets. This approach allows for a static and dynamic analysis of the
score encompassing all the possible outcomes during the performance of these
works.

evidence for the anomalous radiation emitted from YBCO electrodes under short,
intense current pulses previously reported by E. Podkletnov. The generation
conditions are somewhat different: lower applied voltage, longer duration of
the pulses, absence of a discharge chamber. The microstructure of the emitter
is also different in the two cases. While Podkletnov's radiation beam is
collimated, Poher's beam is more or less diverging, depending on the emitter
type. In coincidence with the radiation emission Poher measures a strong recoil
of the emitter, with maximum momentum of the order of 1 kg m/s. We compare and
discuss several details of the experiments and give a brief outline of the
proposed theoretical explanations. We also report numerical simulations of the
maximum electromagnetic recoil force on a Josephson junction, as a benchmark
for a possible alternative explanation of the recoil.

  Method","10 pages, 5 figures, 1 table",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a newly developed Replica Exchange algorithm using q -Gaussian
Swarm Quantum Particle Optimization (REX@q-GSQPO) method for solving the
problem of finding the global optimum. The basis of the algorithm is to run
multiple copies of independent swarms at different values of q parameter. Based
on an energy criterion, chosen to satisfy the detailed balance, we are swapping
the particle coordinates of neighboring swarms at regular iteration intervals.
The swarm replicas with high q values are characterized by high diversity of
particles allowing escaping local minima faster, while the low q replicas,
characterized by low diversity of particles, are used to sample more
efficiently the local basins. We compare the new algorithm with the standard
Gaussian Swarm Quantum Particle Optimization (GSQPO) and q-Gaussian Swarm
Quantum Particle Optimization (q-GSQPO) algorithms, and we found that the new
algorithm is more robust in terms of the number of fitness function calls, and
more efficient in terms ability convergence to the global minimum. In
additional, we also provide a method of optimally allocating the swarm replicas
among different q values. Our algorithm is tested for three benchmark
functions, which are known to be multimodal problems, at different
dimensionalities. In addition, we considered a polyalanine peptide of 12
residues modeled using a G\=o coarse-graining potential energy function.

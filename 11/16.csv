graphene, are a possible route to graphene-based electronics due to their
semiconducting properties, including the emergence of fractional eV band gaps.
The utility of GNM's would be markedly increased if a scheme to stably and
controllably dope them was developed. In this work, a chemically-motivated
approach to GNM doping based on selective pore-perimeter passivation and
subsequent ion chelation is proposed. It is shown by first-principles
calculations that ion chelation leads to stable doping of the passivated GNM's
-- both {\it n}- and {\it p}-doping are achieved within a rigid-band picture.
Such chelated or ``crown'' GNM structures are stable, high mobility
semiconducting materials possessing intrinsic doping-concentration control;
these can serve as building blocks for edge-free graphene nanoelectronics
including GNM-based complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)-type logic
switches.

comply with the generalized density scaling law of molecular dynamics versus
$h(\rho ) / T$ at different densities $\rho $ and temperatures $T$, where the
scaling exponent can be in general only a density function $\gamma(\rho ) =
\it{d} \rm{ln} \it{h / d} \rm{ln}\rho $ as recently argued by the theory of
isomorphs. We successfully verify these equations of state by using data
obtained from molecular dynamics simulations of the Kob-Andersen binary

one-parameter density function $h(\rho )$ analytically formulated in the case
of this prototypical model of supercooled liquid, which implies the
one-parameter density function $\gamma(\rho )$, is able to scale the structural
relaxation times with the value of this function parameter determined by
fitting the volumetric simulation data to the equations of state. We also show
that these equations of state properly describe the pressure dependences of the
isothermal bulk modulus and the configurational isothermal bulk modulus in the
extremely wide pressure range investigated by the computer simulations.
Moreover, we discuss the possible forms of the density functions $h(\rho )$ and
$\gamma(\rho )$ for real glass formers, which are suggested to be different

results suppressed by powers of the KK scale relative to the much larger masses

the conditions for unbroken supersymmetry can be satisfied locally everywhere
within the extra dimensions, but are obstructed by global conditions like flux
quantization or the mutual inconsistency of boundary conditions at the various
branes. Consequently quantities forbidden by supersymmetry cannot be nonzero
until wavelengths of order the KK scale are integrated out, since only such
long wavelength modes see the entire space and so know that supersymmetry
breaks. We verify these arguments by extending earlier rugby-ball calculations
of one-loop vacuum energies to more general pairs of branes within two warped
extra dimensions. The predicted effective 4D vacuum energy density can be of
order C (m Mg/4 pi Mp)^4, where Mg (Mp) is the rationalized 6D (4D) Planck

labeling. Such causets are well-behaved and have a rigid geometry that is
determined by a sequence of positive integers called the shell sequence. We
first consider the microscopic picture. In this picture, the vertices of a
c-causet have integer labels that are unique up to a label isomorphism. This
labeling enables us to define a natural metric $d(a,b)$ between time-like
separated vertices $a$ and $b$. The time metric $d(a,b)$ results in a natural
definition of a geodesic from $a$ to $b$. It turns out that there can be $n\ge
1$ such geodesics. Letting $a$ be the origin (the big bang), we define the
curvature $K(b)$ of $b$ to be $n-1$. Assuming that particles tend to move along
geodesics, $K(b)$ gives the tendency that vertex $b$ is occupied. In this way,
the mass distribution is determined by the geometry of the c-causet. We next
consider the macroscopic picture which describes the growth process of
c-causets. We propose that this process is governed by a quantum dynamics given
by complex amplitudes. At present, these amplitudes are unknown. But if they
can be found, they will determine the (approximate) geometry of the c-causet
describing our particular universe. As an illustration, we present a simple
example of an amplitude process that may have physical relevance. We also give

event in the detector and the instantaneous luminosity of the beam. We focus in

radiation provides adequate cooling for the dust particle. On the other hand,
the survivability of micrometer dust particles near the divertor plates is
drastically reduced when $q_0\simeq 10$ MW/m$^2$. Micrometer dust particles
redeposit their material non-locally, leading to a net poloidal mass migration
across the divertor. Smaller particles (with radius $\sim 0.1$ $\mu$m) cannot
survive near the divertor and redeposit their material locally. Bigger particle
(with radius $\sim 10$ $\mu$m) can instead survive partially and move outside
the divertor strike points, thus causing a net loss of divertor material to
dust accumulation inside the chamber and some non-local redeposition. The
implications of these results for ITER are discussed.

known as Lense-Thirring effect (LTE) and is a manifestation of the general
relativistic phenomenon of dragging of inertial frames or frame-dragging. The
LTE has already been measured by using the node drifts of the LAGEOS satellites
and GRACE-based Earth gravity field models with an accuracy of about 10% and
will be improved down to a few percent with the recent LARES experiment. The
Galileo system will provide 27 new node observables for the LTE estimation and
their combination with the LAGEOS and LARES satellites can potentially reduce
even more the error due to the mismodeling in Earth's gravity field. However,
the accurate determination of the Galileo orbits requires the estimation of
many different parameters, which can absorb the LTE on the orbital nodes.
Moreover, the accuracy of the Galileo orbits and hence, of their node drifts,
is mainly limited by the mismodeling in the Solar Radiation Pressure (SRP).
Using simulated data we analyze the effects of the mismodeling in the SRP on
the Galileo nodes and propose optimal orbit parameterizations for the
measurement of the LTE from the future Galileo observations.

measurements of galaxy position angles. By analysing the statistical properties
of the galaxy orientations given a known intrinsic ellipticity distribution, we
show that it is possible to obtain estimates of the shear by minimizing a
$\chi^2$ statistic. The method is demonstrated using simulations where the
components of the intrinsic ellipticity are taken to be Gaussian distributed.
Uncertainties in the position angle measurements introduce a bias into the
shear estimates which can be reduced to negligible levels by introducing a
correction term into the formalism. We generalize our approach by developing an
algorithm to obtain direct shear estimators given any azimuthally symmetric
intrinsic ellipticity distribution. We introduce a method of measuring the
position angles of the galaxies from noisy pixelized images, and propose a
method to correct for biases which arise due to pixelization and correlations
between measurement errors and galaxy ellipticities. We also develop a method
to constrain the sample of galaxies used to obtain an estimate of the intrinsic
ellipticity distribution such that fractional biases in the resulting shear
estimates are below a given threshold value. We demonstrate the angle only
method by applying it to simulations where the ellipticities are taken to
follow a log-normal distribution. We compare the performance of the position
angle only method with the standard method based on full ellipticity
measurements by reconstructing lensing convergence maps from both numerical
simulations and from the CFHTLenS data. We find that the difference between the
convergence maps reconstructed using the two methods is consistent with noise.

and previous correlated-electron theories of phenacenes is that our
calculations are exact within the reduced basis space, albeit for finite
clusters. The enhanced exchange of electron populations between these molecular
orbitals, driven by Coulomb interactions over and above the bandwidth effects,
gives a theoretical description of the phenanthrene trianions that is very
different from previous predictions. Exact many-body finite cluster
calculations show that while the systems with molecular charges of $-$1 and
$-$2 are one- and two-band Mott-Hubbard semiconductors, respectively, molecular
charge $-$3 gives two nearly $\frac{3}{4}$-filled bands, rather than a
completely filled lower band and a $\frac{1}{2}$-filled upper band. The carrier
density per active molecular orbital is thus nearly the same in the normal
state of the superconducting aromatics and organic charge-transfer solids, and

feasible solution. In addition, the computation of the payments is also done in
polylogarithmic time and space. Furthermore, the mechanisms need to maintain
incentive compatibility with respect to the allocation and payments.
  We present local computation mechanisms for a variety of classical
game-theoretical problems: 1. stable matching, 2. job scheduling, 3.
combinatorial auctions for unit-demand and k-minded bidders, and 4. the housing
allocation problem.
  For stable matching, some of our techniques may have general implications.
Specifically, we show that when the men's preference lists are bounded, we can
achieve an arbitrarily good approximation to the stable matching within a fixed
number of iterations of the Gale-Shapley algorithm.

for understanding the properties of galaxies and is now increasingly used to
carry out galaxy surveys. Low redshift surveys include SAURON, DiskMass,
ATLAS3D, PINGS and VENGA. At redshifts above 0.7, surveys such as MASSIV, SINS,
GLACE, and IMAGES have targeted the most luminous galaxies to study mainly
their kinematic properties. The on-going CALIFA survey ($z\sim0.02$) is the
first of a series of upcoming Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) surveys with
large samples representative of the entire population of galaxies. Others
include SAMI and MaNGA at lower redshift and the upcoming KMOS surveys at
higher redshift. Given the importance of spatial scales in IFS surveys, the
study of the effects of spatial resolution on the recovered parameters becomes
important. We explore the capability of the CALIFA survey and a hypothetical
higher redshift survey to reproduce the properties of a sample of objects
observed with better spatial resolution at lower redshift. Using a sample of
PINGS galaxies, we simulate observations at different redshifts. We then study
the behaviour of different parameters as the spatial resolution degrades with

a homogenous magnetic field is applied to completely break the degeneracy of

entanglement is quantified using concurrence for which analytical formulae are
derived in various thermal mixing scenarios. The electric field plays a
specific role -- it breaks the symmetry of the system and changes spin
correlations. Rotating the electric field can create maximally entangled qubit
pairs together with a separate spin (monogamy) that survives in a relatively
wide temperature range providing robust pairwise entanglement generation at

These microelectrodes have also been instrumental in the localization of

been mostly utilized in vivo, where the true neuron location remains unknown.
Therefore, these methods could not be experimentally validated. This article
presents experimental validation of a method capable of estimating both the
location and intensity of an electrical signal source. A four-sensor
microelectrode (tetrode) immersed in a saline solution was used to record
stimulus patterns at multiple intensity levels generated by a stimulating
electrode. The location of the tetrode was varied with respect to the
stimulator. The location and intensity of the stimulator were estimated using
the Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm, and the results were
quantified by comparison to the true values. The localization results, with an
accuracy and precision of ~ 10 microns, and ~ 11 microns respectively, imply
that MUSIC can resolve individual neuronal sources. Similarly, source intensity
estimations indicate that this approach can track changes in signal amplitude
over time. Together, these results suggest that MUSIC can be used to
characterize neuronal signal sources in vivo.

their properties provide a critical test of stellar evolutionary theory. The
galactic yellow hypergiant IRC +10420 is a cornerstone system for understanding
this phase, since it is the strongest post-RSG candidate known, has
demonstrated real-time evolution across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and
been subject to extensive mass loss. Here we report on the discovery of a twin
of IRC +10420 - IRAS 18357-0604. Optical and near-IR spectroscopy are used to
investigate the physical properties of IRAS 18357-0604, while IR photometry
probes the nature of its circumstellar environment. Pronounced spectral
similarities between IRAS 18357-0604 and IRC +10420 suggest comparable
temperatures and wind geometries, while photometric data reveals a similarly
dusty circumstellar environment, although historical mass loss appears to have
been heavier in IRC +10420. The systemic velocity implies a distance compatible
with the red supergiant dominated complex at the base of the Scutum Crux arm;
the resultant luminosity determination is consistent with a physical
association but suggests a lower initial mass than inferred for IRC +10420
(<20Msun versus ~40Msun). Evolutionary predictions for the physical properties
of supernova progenitors derived from ~18-20Msun stars - or ~12-15Msun stars

favourably with those of IRAS 18357-0604, which in turn appears to be similar
to the the progenitor of SN2011dh; it may therefore provide an important

The existence of the additional solutions calls into question the robustness of
exclusion limits derived from collider experiments and cosmological
observations upon the CMSSM, because limits were only placed on one of the
solutions. Here, we map the CMSSM by exploring its multi-dimensional parameter
space using the shooting method, which is not subject to the stability issues
which can plague fixed point iteration. We are able to find multiple solutions
where in all previous literature only one was found. The multiple solutions are
of two distinct classes. One class, close to the border of bad electroweak
symmetry breaking, is disfavoured by LEP2 searches for neutralinos and
charginos. The other class has sparticles that are heavy enough to evade the
LEP2 bounds. Chargino masses may differ by up to around 10% between the
different solutions, whereas other sparticle masses differ at the sub-percent
level. The prediction for the dark matter relic density can vary by a hundred
percent or more between the different solutions, so analyses employing the dark
matter constraint are incomplete without their inclusion.

models of multiple-field inflation. By performing a sudden decay calculation,
we derive analytic expressions for the local-type non-linearity parameter
$f_{\rm NL}^{\rm local}$, the scalar spectral index $n_\zeta$, and the
tensor-to-scalar ratio $r_T$ as functions of the decay rates of the
inflationary fields. We compare our analytic results to a fully numerical
classical field theory simulation, finding excellent agreement. We find that
the sensitivity of $f_{\rm NL}$, $n_\zeta$, and $r_T$ to the reheating phase
depends heavily on the underlying inflationary model. We quantify this
sensitivity, and discuss conditions that must be satisfied if observable
predictions are to be insensitive to the dynamics of reheating. We demonstrate
that upon completion of reheating, all observable quantities take values within
finite ranges, the limits of which are determined completely by the conditions
during inflation. Furthermore, fluctuations in both fields play an important
role in determining the full dependence of the observables on the dynamics of
reheating. By applying our formalism to two concrete examples, we demonstrate
that variations in $f_{\rm NL}$, $n_\zeta$, and $r_T$ caused by changes in
reheating dynamics are well within the sensitivity of Planck, and as such the
impact of reheating must be accounted for when making predictions for models of
multiple-field inflation. Our final expressions are very general, encompassing
a wide range of two-field inflationary models, including the standard curvaton
scenario. Our results allow a much more unified approach to studying two-field
inflation including the effects of perturbative reheating. As such, entire
classes of models can be studied together, allowing a more systematic approach
to gaining insight into the physics of the early universe through observation.

linear combination of valence bond basis states. The range of valence bonds
within this linear combination as well as the correlations between them can
reveal the nature of the singlet state, and are key ingredients in variational
calculations. In this work, we study the bipartite valence bond distributions
and their correlations within the ground state of the Heisenberg
antiferromagnet on bipartite lattices. In terms of field theory, this problem
can be mapped to correlation functions near a boundary. In dimension d >= 2, a
non-linear sigma model analysis reveals that at long distances the probability
distribution P(r) of valence bond lengths decays as |r|^(-d-1) and that valence
bonds are uncorrelated. By a bosonization analysis, we also obtain P(r)
proportional to |r|^(-d-1) in d=1 despite the different mechanism. On the other
hand, we find that correlations between valence bonds are important even at
large distances in d=1, in stark contrast to d >= 2. The analytical results are
confirmed by high-precision quantum Monte Carlo simulations in d=1, 2, and 3.
We develop a single-projection loop variant of the valence bond projection

formation is usually updated in time as material is accreted to the disc by
adopting a constant dimensionless spin parameter and little attention is paid
to the effects of accretion with misaligned angular momenta. These effects are
the subject of this paper, where we adopt a Monte-Carlo simulation for the
changes in the direction of the angular momentum of a galaxy disc as it
accretes matter based on accurate measurements from dark-matter haloes in the
Millennium II simulation. In our semi-analytic model implementation, the flips
seen the dark matter haloes are assumed to be the same for the cold baryons;
however, we also assume that in the latter the flip also entails a difficulty
for the disc to increase its angular momentum which causes the disc to become
smaller relative to a no-flip case. This makes star formation to occur faster,
specially in low mass galaxies at all redshifts allowing galaxies to reach
higher stellar masses faster. We adopt a new condition for the triggering of
starbursts during mergers. As these produce the largest flips it is natural to
adopt the disc instability criterion to evaluate the triggering of bursts in
mergers instead of one based on mass ratios as in the original model. The new
implementation reduces the average lifetimes of discs by a factor of 2, while
still allowing old ages for the present-day discs of large spiral galaxies. It
also provides a faster decline of star formation in massive galaxies and a
better fit to the bright end of the luminosity function at z = 0.

approach between the relative simplicity of ''one-ion'' average atom models and

Physical realism is achieved primarily by including the correlations in the
plasma that surrounds a central ion. The plasma is described with the
Ornstein-Zernike integral equations theory of fluids, which is coupled to an
average atom model for the central ion. In this contribution we emphasize the
key elements and approximations and how they relate to and expand upon a
typical average atom model. Besides being relatively inexpensive
computationally, this approach offers several advantages over ab initio
simulations but also has a number of limitations. The model is validated by
comparisons with numerical solutions for the pair distribution function of the
ions from ab initio simulations for several elements and a wide range of plasma
conditions. Simulations results are reproduced remarkably well and simpler
limiting theories are recovered as well. This model has many potential
applications to calculation of the properties of warm dense matter such as the
equation of state and conductivities for a wide range of temperatures and

star-forming region. Using multi-epoch optical and near-IR follow-up
spectroscopy with FLAMES on the Very Large Telescope and ISIS on the William
Herschel Telescope we obtain a full orbital solution and derive the fundamental
parameters of both stars by modelling the light curve and radial velocity data.
The orbit is circular and has a period of $3.8745745 \pm 0.0000014$ days. The
masses and radii of the two stars are $0.67 \pm 0.01$ and $0.495 \pm 0.007$
$M_{\odot}$ and $1.30 \pm 0.04$ and $1.11 ~^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$ $R_{\odot}$,
respectively. This system is a useful test of evolutionary models of young
low-mass stars, as it lies in a region of parameter space where observational
constraints are scarce; comparison with these models indicates an apparent age
of $\sim$3.5-6 Myr. The systemic velocity is within $1\sigma$ of the cluster
value which, along with the presence of lithium absorption, strongly indicates
cluster membership. The CoRoT light curve also contains large-amplitude,
rapidly evolving out-of-eclipse variations, which are difficult to explain
using starspots alone. The system's spectral energy distribution reveals a
mid-infrared excess, which we model as thermal emission from a small amount of
dust located in the inner cavity of a circumbinary disk. In turn, this opens up
the possibility that some of the out-of-eclipse variability could be due to
occultations of the central stars by material located at the inner edge or in
the central cavity of the circumbinary disk.

consistent with the value of Vickers hardness (11.7 to 32.3 GPa) by employing
different empirical hardness models and below the superhardness threshold of 40

location-based applications and services have access to accurate and real-time
location information, raising serious privacy concerns for their millions of
users. Trying to address these issues, the notion of geo-indistinguishability
was recently introduced, adapting the well-known concept of Differential
Privacy to the area of location-based systems. A Laplace-based obfuscation
mechanism satisfying this privacy notion works well in the case of a sporadic
use; Under repeated use, however, independently applying noise leads to a quick
loss of privacy due to the correlation between the location in the trace.
  In this paper we show that correlations in the trace can be in fact exploited
in terms of a prediction function that tries to guess the new location based on
the previously reported locations. The proposed mechanism tests the quality of
the predicted location using a private test; in case of success the prediction
is reported otherwise the location is sanitized with new noise. If there is
considerable correlation in the input trace, the extra cost of the test is
small compared to the savings in budget, leading to a more efficient mechanism.
  We evaluate the mechanism in the case of a user accessing a location-based
service while moving around in a city. Using a simple prediction function and
two budget spending stategies, optimizing either the utility or the budget
consumption rate, we show that the predictive mechanim can offer substantial
improvements over the independently applied noise.

algorithmic questions. However, even though fixed-parameter algorithms are
appealing for many reasons, no such algorithms are known for many fundamental
scheduling problems.
  In this paper we present the first fixed-parameter algorithms for classical
scheduling problems such as makespan minimization, scheduling with
job-dependent cost functions-one important example being weighted flow time-and
scheduling with rejection. To this end, we identify crucial parameters that
determine the problems' complexity. In particular, we manage to cope with the
problem complexity stemming from numeric input values, such as job processing
times, which is usually a core bottleneck in the design of fixed-parameter
algorithms. We complement our algorithms with W[1]-hardness results showing
that for smaller sets of parameters the respective problems do not allow
FPT-algorithms. In particular, our positive and negative results for scheduling
with rejection explore a research direction proposed by D\'aniel Marx.
  We hope that our contribution yields a new and fresh perspective on
scheduling and fixed-parameter algorithms and will lead to further fruitful

balanced against present costs. This is traditionally done using an exponential
function with a constant discount rate, which reduces the present value of
future costs. The result is highly sensitive to the choice of discount rate and
has generated a major controversy as to the urgency for immediate action. We
study analytically several standard interest rate models from finance and
compare their properties to empirical data. From historical time series for
nominal interest rates and inflation covering 14 countries over hundreds of
years, we find that extended periods of negative real interest rates are
common, occurring in many epochs in all countries. This leads us to choose the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model, in which real short run interest rates fluctuate
stochastically and can become negative, even if they revert to a positive mean
value. We solve the model in closed form and prove that the long-run discount
rate is always less than the mean; indeed it can be zero or even negative,
despite the fact that the mean short term interest rate is positive. We fit the
parameters of the model to the data, and find that nine of the countries have
positive long run discount rates while five have negative long-run discount
rates. Even if one rejects the countries where hyperinflation has occurred, our
results support the low discounting rate used in the Stern report over higher
rates advocated by others.

  of Automatic Control (IFAC)",,,,"cs.SY cs.RO physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Animals within groups need to coordinate their reactions to perceived
environmental features and to each other in order to safely move from one point
to another. This paper extends our previously published work on the flight
patterns of Myotis velifer that have been observed in a habitat near Johnson
City, Texas. Each evening, these bats emerge from a cave in sequences of small
groups that typically contain no more than three or four individuals, and they
thus provide ideal subjects for studying leader-follower behaviors. By
analyzing the flight paths of a group of M. velifer, the data show that the
flight behavior of a follower bat is influenced by the flight behavior of a
leader bat in a way that is not well explained by existing pursuit laws, such
as classical pursuit, constant bearing and motion camouflage. Thus we propose
an alternative steering law based on virtual loom, a concept we introduce to
capture the geometrical configuration of the leader-follower pair. It is shown
that this law may be integrated with our previously proposed vision-enabled
steering laws to synthesize trajectories, the statistics of which fit with
those of the bats in our data set. The results suggest that bats use perceived
information of both the environment and their neighbors for navigation.

(ISM) of the host galaxy. We argue that SMBH growth is dominated by accretion
of dense cold clumps and filaments. AGN feedback outflows overtake the cold
medium, compress it, and trigger a powerful starburst -- a positive AGN
feedback. This predicts a statistical correlation between AGN luminosity and
star formation rate at high luminosities. Most of the outflow's kinetic energy
escapes from the bulge via low density voids. The cold phase is pushed outward
only by the ram pressure (momentum) of the outflow. The combination of the
negative and positive forms of AGN feedback leads to an $M-\sigma$ relation
similar to the result of King (2003). Due to porosity of cold ISM in the bulge,
SMBH influence on the low density medium of the host galaxy is significant even
for SMBH well below the $M-\sigma$ mass. The role of SMBH feedback in our model
evolves in space and time with the ISM structure. In the early gas rich phase,
SMBH accelerates star formation in the bulge. During later gas poor
(red-and-dead) phases, SMBH feedback is mostly negative everywhere due to
scarcity of the cold ISM.

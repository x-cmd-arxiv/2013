quasicrystals with high rotational symmetries not achievable by the
conventional periodic crystals. Accurate control of the properties of the
interfering beams is necessary to provide photonic band-gap structures. Here we
show, by FDTD simulations of the transmission spectra of 8-fold quasiperiodic
structures, how the geometric tiling of the structure affects the presence and
properties of the photonic band-gap for low refractive index contrasts. Hence,
we show an interesting approach to the fabrication of photonic quasicrystals
based on the use of a programmable Spatial Light Modulator encoding
Computer-Generated Holograms, that permits an accurate control of the writing
pattern with almost no limitations in the pattern design. Using this
single-beam technique we fabricated quasiperiodic structures with high
rotational symmetries and different geometries of the tiling, demonstrating the
great versatility of our technique.

robot arm systems becomes very difficult in presence of non-linear
uncertainties in the system. Also, perturbations exist due to various unwanted
interactions with obstacles for clumsy environments in which obstacle avoidance
is not possible, and this makes position regulation even more difficult. This
report proposes a non-linear task-space disturbance observer by virtue of which
position regulation of such robotic systems can be achieved in spite of such
perturbations and uncertainties. Simulations are conducted using a 7-DOF
redundant robot arm system to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
These results are then compared with the case of a conventional mass-damper
based task-space disturbance observer to show the enhancement in performance
using the developed concept. This proposed method is then applied to a
controller which exhibits human-like motion characteristics for reaching a
target. Arbitrary perturbations in the form of interactions with obstacles are
introduced in its path. Results show that the robot end-effector successfully
continues to move in its path of a human-like quasi-straight trajectory even if
the joint trajectories deviated by a considerable amount due to the
perturbations. These results are also compared with that of the unperturbed
motion of the robot which further prove the significance of the developed

complement $\gamma$-ray observations with the analysis of the WMAP 7-year data

In combination with archival radio data, the radio spectrum shows a spectral
break which helps to constrain the relativistic electron spectrum, hence
parameters of simple non-thermal radiation models. In one-zone models
multiwavelength data favor the origin of $\gamma$ rays from nucleon-nucleon

predominantly inverse-Compton origin of the $\gamma$-ray emission is disfavored

generalized cost functional, and a data-based reinforcement learning technique
is developed. It is known that the nonlinear optimal control problem relies on
the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which is a
nonlinear partial differential equation that is generally impossible to be
solved analytically. Even worse, most of practical systems are too complicated
to establish their accurate mathematical model. To overcome these difficulties,
we propose a data-based approximate policy iteration (API) method by using real
system data rather than system model. Firstly, a model-free policy iteration
algorithm is derived for constrained optimal control problem and its
convergence is proved, which can learn the solution of HJB equation and optimal
control policy without requiring any knowledge of system mathematical model.
The implementation of the algorithm is based on the thought of actor-critic
structure, where actor and critic neural networks (NNs) are employed to
approximate the control policy and cost function, respectively. To update the
weights of actor and critic NNs, a least-square approach is developed based on
the method of weighted residuals. The whole data-based API method includes two
parts, where the first part is implemented online to collect real system
information, and the second part is conducting offline policy iteration to
learn the solution of HJB equation and the control policy. Then, the data-based
API algorithm is simplified for solving unconstrained optimal control problem
of nonlinear and linear systems. Finally, we test the efficiency of the
data-based API control design method on a simple nonlinear system, and further
apply it to a rotational/translational actuator system. The simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

\|L x\|_2^2\}$. $ x(\lambda)$ depends on regularization parameter $\lambda$
that trades off the data fidelity, and on the smoothing norm determined by $L$.
Here we consider the case where $L$ is diagonal and invertible, and employ the
Galerkin method to provide the relationship between the singular value
expansion and the singular value decomposition for square integrable kernels.
The resulting approximation of the integral equation permits examination of the
properties of the regularized solution $ x(\lambda)$ independent of the sample
size of the data. We prove that estimation of the regularization parameter can
be obtained by consistently down sampling the data and the system matrix,
leading to solutions of coarse to fine grained resolution. Hence, the estimate
of $\lambda$ for a large problem may be found by downsampling to a smaller
problem, or to a set of smaller problems, effectively moving the costly
estimate of the regularization parameter to the coarse representation of the
problem. Moreover, the full singular value decomposition for the fine scale
system is replaced by a number of dominant terms which is determined from the
coarse resolution system, again reducing the computational cost. Numerical
results illustrate the theory and demonstrate the practicality of the approach
for regularization parameter estimation using generalized cross validation,
unbiased predictive risk estimation and the discrepancy principle applied for

computationally and analytically tractable. Our GP map arises naturally from
the self-assembly of polyomino structures on a 2D lattice and exhibits a number
of properties: $\textit{redundancy}$ (genotypes vastly outnumber phenotypes),
$\textit{phenotype bias}$ (genotypic redundancy varies greatly between
phenotypes), $\textit{genotype component disconnectivity}$ (phenotypes consist
of disconnected mutational networks) and $\textit{shape space covering}$ (most
phenotypes can be reached in a small number of mutations). We also show that
the mutational robustness of phenotypes scales very roughly logarithmically
with phenotype redundancy and is positively correlated with phenotypic
evolvability. Although our GP map describes the assembly of disconnected
objects, it shares many properties with other popular GP maps for connected
units, such as models for RNA secondary structure or the HP lattice model for
protein tertiary structure. The remarkable fact that these important properties
similarly emerge from such different models suggests the possibility that
universal features underlie a much wider class of biologically realistic GP

comparison purpose, we also examine the traditional multiuser scheduling and
the artificial noise schemes. We analyze the achievable secrecy rate and
intercept probability of the traditional and proposed multiuser scheduling

Numerical results show that given a primary QoS constraint, the proposed
multiuser scheduling scheme generally outperforms the traditional multiuser
scheduling and the artificial noise schemes in terms of the achievable secrecy
rate and intercept probability. In addition, we derive the diversity order of
the proposed multiuser scheduling scheme through an asymptotic intercept

of the QPCs conform the lead-to-ring junctions while a third one is placed
symmetrically in the upper arm of the QR. Using an appropriate scattering model
for the QPCs and the $\mathbb{S}$-matrix scattering approach, we analyze the
role of the QPCs on the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) and Aharonov-Casher (AC) conductance
oscillations of the QR-device. Exact formulas are obtained for the
spin-resolved conductances of the QR-device as a function of the confinement of
the QPCs and the AB/AC phases. Conditions for the appearance of resonances and
anti-resonances in the spin-conductance are derived and discussed. We predict
very distinctive variations of the QR-conductance oscillations not seen in
previous QR proposals. In particular we find that the interference pattern in
the QR can be manipulated to a large extend by varying electrically the
lead-to-ring topological parameters. The latter can be used to modulate the AB
and AC phases by applying gate voltage only. We have shown also that the
conductance oscillations exhibits a crossover to well-defined resonances as the
lateral QPC confinement strength is increased, mapping the eigenenergies of the
QR. In addition, unique features of the conductance arises by varying the
aperture of the upper-arm QPC and the Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Our results
may be of relevance for promising spin-orbitonics devices based in quantum

deformed at Tg - 19 K, for local strain rates between 3.7x10-5/s and
1.2x10-4/s. In these experiments, the mobility initially increases in the
pre-yield regime, by a factor of 40 to 160, as compared to the undeformed PMMA
glass. The mobility then remains constant after yield, even as the stress is
decreasing due to strain softening. This is consistent with the view that the
sample is being pulled higher on the potential energy landscape in this regime.
Higher strain rates lead to higher mobility in the post-yield regime and, for
the range of strain rates investigated, mobility and strain rate are linearly
correlated. We observe that thermal history has no influence on mobility after
yield and that deformation leads to a narrowing of the distribution of
segmental relaxation times. These last three observations are consistent with
previously reported constant stress experiments on PMMA glasses. The
experimental features reported here are compared to computer simulations and
theoretical models.

gravitational wave detectors such as Advanced LIGO and Virgo will allow us to
probe the genuinely strong-field dynamics of general relativity (GR) for the
first time. We present a data analysis pipeline called TIGER (Test
Infrastructure for GEneral Relativity), which is designed to utilize detections
of compact binary coalescences to test GR in this regime. TIGER is a
model-independent test of GR itself, in that it is not necessary to compare
with any specific alternative theory. It performs Bayesian inference on two
hypotheses: the GR hypothesis $\mathcal{H}_{\rm GR}$, and $\mathcal{H}_{\rm
modGR}$, which states that one or more of the post-Newtonian coefficients in
the waveform are not as predicted by GR. By the use of multiple sub-hypotheses
of $\mathcal{H}_{\rm modGR}$, in each of which a different number of
parameterized deformations of the GR phase are allowed, an arbitrarily large
number of 'testing parameters' can be used without having to worry about a
model being insufficiently parsimonious if the true number of extra parameters
is in fact small. TIGER is well-suited to the regime where most sources have
low signal-to-noise ratios, again through the use of these sub-hypotheses.
Information from multiple sources can trivially be combined, leading to a
stronger test. We focus on binary neutron star coalescences, for which
sufficiently accurate waveform models are available that can be generated fast
enough on a computer to be fit for use in Bayesian inference. We show that the
pipeline is robust against a number of fundamental, astrophysical, and
instrumental effects, such as differences between waveform approximants, a
limited number of post-Newtonian phase contributions being known, the effects
of neutron star spins and tidal deformability on the orbital motion, and
instrumental calibration errors.

with a special kind of regularity in tracing (a weaker version of periodic
specification property). This in turn implies that the set of ergodic measures
supported on the closures of orbits of regularly recurrent points is dense in
the space of all invariant measures (in particular, invariant measures in such
a system form the Poulsen simplex, up to an affine homeomorphism).

$2\min(n,m)-1$ except when we allow crossings and $n=m\ge 3$, in which case the

introduced as an operator X to gamma (H; Y), where X, Y are Banach spaces, H is
a Hilbert space, and gamma(H; Y) is the space of gamma-radonifying operators.
By the seminal work of Kalton and Weis, this definition is a coherent
generalisation of the classical notion of square function appearing in the
theory of singular integrals. Given an abstract functional calculus (E, F, Phi)
on a Banach space X, where F (O) is an algebra of scalar-valued functions on a
set O, we define a square function Phi_gamma(f) for certain H-valued functions
f on O. The assignment f to Phi_gamma(f) then becomes a vectorial functional
calculus, and a ""square function estimate"" for f simply means the boundedness
of Phi_gamma(f). In this view, all results linking square function estimates
with the boundedness of a certain (usually the H-infinity) functional calculus
simply assert that certain square function estimates imply other square
function estimates. In the present paper several results of this type are
proved in an abstract setting, based on the principles of subordination,
integral representation, and a new boundedness concept for subsets of Hilbert
spaces, the so-called ell-1 -frame-boundedness. These abstract results are then
applied to the H-infinity calculus for sectorial and strip type operators. For
example, it is proved that any strip type operator with bounded scalar
H-infinity calculus on a strip over a Banach space with finite cotype has a
bounded vectorial H-infinity calculus on every larger strip.

introduce in this paper the lossy G-IDNC graph (LG-IDNC). Whereas the G-IDNC
graph represents only doubtless combinable packets, the LG-IDNC graph
represents also uncertain packet combinations when the expected decoding delay
of the encoded packet is lower than the individual expected decoding delay of

be NP-hard, we use the heuristic introduced in [2] to discover the maximum
weight clique in the LG-IDNC graph and finally we compare the decoding delay
performance of LG-IDNC and G-IDNC graphs through extensive simulations.
Numerical results show that our new LG-IDNC graph formulation outperforms the

a set of basic arms, where the decision maker plays a complex action rather
than a basic arm in each round. The reward of the complex action is some
function of the basic arms' rewards, and the feedback observed may not
necessarily be the reward per-arm. For instance, when the complex actions are
subsets of the arms, we may only observe the maximum reward over the chosen

discretely-supported priors over the parameter space and without additional
structural properties such as closed-form posteriors, conjugate prior structure

We investigate the nature of the chiral transition as a function of quark mass

At sufficiently large imaginary chemical potential, a clear signal for a

decreasing imaginary chemical potential. The second-order critical line
m_c(mu_i), which marks the boundary between first-order and crossover

is definitely Zeeman detected. Only 5 G and K giants, situated mainly at the

Surprisingly, a lot of stars ascending towards the RGB tip and in early AGB

the change in monetary policy in 1994-1995. For the GDP deflator, our original
model provided a root mean squared forecast error (RMSFE) of 1.0% per year at a
four-year horizon for the period between 1971 and 2004. The rate of CPI
inflation is predicted with RMSFE=1.5% per year. For the naive (no change)
forecast, RMSFE at the same time horizon is 2.95% and 3.3% per year,

relationships for inflation were successfully tested for cointegration. We have
formally estimated several vector error correction (VEC) models for two

significant statistical improvements on the results obtained by the BEM:
RMSFE=0.8% per year for the GDP deflator and ~1.2% per year for CPI. For a two

lack the common understanding of the processes of life and cognition in living

computational processes in embodied, embedded cognizing agents, both living and
artifactual ones. Starting with the definition of an agent as an entity capable
of acting on its own behalf, as an actor in Hewitt Actor model of computation,
even so simple systems as molecules can be modelled as actors exchanging
messages (information). We adopt Kauffmans view of a living agent as something
that can reproduce and undergoes at least one thermodynamic work cycle. This
definition of living agents leads to the Maturana and Varelas identification of
life with cognition. Within the info-computational constructive approach to

heavy ion collisions is discussed using a background-fluctuation splitting of
the hydrodynamical fields. For a single event, the particle spectrum, or its
logarithm, can be written as the sum of background part that is symmetric with
respect to azimuthal rotations and longitudinal boosts and a part containing
the contribution of fluctuations or deviations from the background. Using a
complete orthonormal basis to characterize the initial state allows one to
write the double differential harmonic flow coefficients determined by the
two-particle correlation method as matrix expressions involving the initial
fluid correlations. We discuss the use of these expressions for a mode-by-mode
analysis of fluctuating initial conditions in heavy ion collisions.

Here, we study the Casimir-Polder forces experienced by small quantum systems

more tractable, we work in a 1+1 dimensional setting, we take into account only
the ground state and first excited state of the atom and we model the
electromagnetic field as a scalar field with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary
conditions. This allows us to determine the conditions for the Casimir force to
be attractive or repulsive for individual atoms, namely through the interplay
of paramagnetic and diamagnetic vacuum effects. We also study the
microscopic-macroscopic transition, finding that as the number of atoms in the
cavity is increased, the atoms start to affect the Casimir force exerted on the
cavity walls similarly to a dielectric medium.

non-stationary magnetic field of moving Abrikosov vortices may excite spin

force acting on the vortices. By solving the London and Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert
equations we calculate the magnetic moment induced force acting on vortices in
ferromagnetic superconductors and superconductor/ferromagnet superlattices. If
the vortices are driven by a dc force, magnon generation due to the Cherenkov
resonance starts as the vortex velocity exceeds some threshold value. For an
ideal vortex lattice this leads to an anisotropic contribution to the
resistivity and to the appearance of resonance peaks on the current voltage
characteristics. For a disordered vortex array the current will exhibit a
step-like increase at some critical voltage. If the vortices are driven by an
ac force with a frequency \omega, the interaction with magnetic moments will
lead to a frequency-dependent magnetic contribution \eta_M to the vortex
viscosity. If \omega is below the ferromagnetic resonance frequency \omega_F,
vortices acquire additional inertia. For \omega > \omega_F dissipation is
enhanced due to magnon generation. The viscosity \eta_M can be extracted from
the surface impedance of the ferromagnetic superconductor. Estimates of the
magnetic force acting on vortices for the U-based ferromagnetic superconductors

spin state of a Mn atom in a controlled strain environment. The absence of
strain induced magnetic anisotropy prevents an optical pumping of the Mn spin
at zero magnetic field. Thus, a large photoluminescence is obtained under
resonant optical excitation of the exciton-Mn complex. An efficient optical
pumping of the coupled electronic and nuclear spins of the Mn is restored under
a weak magnetic field. The observed reduction of the resonant photoluminescence
intensity under magnetic field is well described by a model including the
hyperfine coupling and a residual crystal field splitting of the Mn atom.
Finally, we show that the second order correlation function of the resonant

for an advantageous mutation is O(n^4) on an n-vertex undirected graph, which
allows the behaviour of the process on undirected graphs to be analysed using
the Markov chain Monte Carlo method. We show that this does not extend to
directed graphs by exhibiting an infinite family of directed graphs for which
the expected absorption time is exponential in the number of vertices. However,
for regular directed graphs, we show that the expected absorption time is
Omega(n log n) and O(n^2). We exhibit families of graphs matching these bounds

number. Our results are obtained via stochastic dominations which we
demonstrate by establishing a coupling in a related continuous-time model. The

Recent formulations of this idea have focused on the question of how well two

alternative approach based on how enhancing the predictability of one
observable necessarily disturbs a complementary one. Our
measurement-disturbance relation refers to a clear operational scenario and is
expressed by entropic quantities with clear statistical meaning. We show that
our relation is perfectly tight for all measurement strengths in an existing

for occurrence of strong anisotropy (SA) in the scaling properties of
two-dimensional surfaces displaying generic scale invariance. There, a natural
Ansatz was proposed for SA, which arises naturally when analyzing data from
e.g. thin-film production experiments. The Ansatz was tested in Gaussian
(linear) models of surface dynamics and in non-linear models, like the
Hwa-Kardar (HK) equation [Phys. Rev. Lett. 62, 1813 (1989)], which are
susceptible of accurate approximations through the former. In contrast, here we
analyze non-linear equations for which such type of approximations fail.
Working within generically-scale-invariant situations, and as representative
case studies, we formulate and study a generalization of the HK equation for
conserved dynamics, and reconsider well-known systems, such as the conserved
and the non-conserved anisotropic Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equations. Through the
combined use of Dynamic Renormalization Group analysis and direct numerical
simulations, we conclude that the occurrence of SA in two-dimensional surfaces
requires dynamics to be conserved. We find that, moreover, SA is not generic in
parameter space but requires, rather, specific shapes from the terms appearing
in the equation of motion, whose justification needs detailed information on
the dynamical process that is being modeled in each particular case.

been debated and even viewed merely as an artifact of a
$\boldsymbol{k{\cdot}p}$ model. Using complementary approaches of both
$\boldsymbol{k{\cdot}p}$ and tight-binding models, further supported by an
effective Hamiltonian for a continuum model, we reveal that the nodal ground
states in quantum dots are not limited to a specific approach. Remarkably, the
emergence of the nodal hole states at the top of the valence band can be
attributed to the formation of the orbital vortex textures through competition
between the hole kinetic energy and the coupling to the conduction band states.
We suggest an experimental test for our predictions of the reversed energy
ordering and the existence of nodal ground states. We discuss how our findings
and the studies of orbital textures could be also relevant for other materials
systems.

relativistic electrons in a spherical region at the considered scales
($\lesssim$10 kpc). Simulations show a wide range of gamma-ray luminosities,
with intensities up to $\sim10^{46}-10^{48}$ erg s$^{-1}$ depending on the

  We first discuss single measurements, where the system proper is coupled to
one probe with arbitrary coupling strength. The goal is to obtain information
on the system detecting the probe position. We find the reduced density
operator of the system, and show how L\""uders rule emerges as the limiting case
of strong coupling.
  The von Neumann model is then generalized to two probes that interact
successively with the system proper. Now we find information on the system by
detecting the position-position and momentum-position correlations of the two
probes. The so-called ""Wigner's formula"" emerges in the strong-coupling limit,
while ""Kirkwood's quasi-probability distribution"" is found as the weak-coupling
limit of the above formalism. We show that successive measurements can be used
to develop a state-reconstruction scheme.

deconvolution of the Herschel data, we find large-scale (several thousand AU)
dust continuum and spectral line emission not associated with the point

The extended dust continuum emission is found in two ridges similar in extent

the Herbig Be star R CrA. Our results show that a nearby luminous star does not
increase the molecular excitation temperatures in the warm gas around a young

to develop instabilities. Similar jet formation has been observed in
explosively dispersed granular media. Our previous work addressed this
instability by performing discrete-particle simulations of inelastic media
undergoing shock compression. By allowing finite dissipation within the shock
wave, instability manifests itself as distinctive high density non-uniformities
and convective rolls within the shock structure. In the present study we have
extended this work to investigate this instability at the continuum level. We
modeled the Euler equations for granular gases with a modified cooling rate to
include an impact velocity threshold necessary for inelastic collisions. Our
results showed a fair agreement between the continuum and discrete-particle

Recent theoretical works have ascribed the multi-mode signal generation to

the dynamics generated by such mode coupling. We show analytically that the

well described by a Voigt lineshape. Furthermore, we show that the mode-hopping

free-floating low-mass brown dwarfs in these star-forming regions. However, 5
of the 7 objects with M $<$ 30 $M_{Jup}$ are redder in K'-L' than the

that this distinction could indicate a structural difference in

blazars in which turbulent plasma flowing at a relativistic speed down a jet
crosses a standing conical shock. The shock compresses the plasma and
accelerates electrons to energies up to gamma(max) > 1E4 times their rest-mass
energy, with the value of gamma(max) determined by the direction of the
magnetic field relative to the shock front. The turbulence is approximated in a
computer code as many cells, each with a uniform magnetic field whose direction
is selected randomly. The density of high-energy electrons in the plasma
changes randomly with time in a manner consistent with the power spectral
density of flux variations derived from observations of blazars. The variations
in flux and polarization are therefore caused by continuous noise processes
rather than by singular events such as explosive injection of energy at the
base of the jet. Sample simulations illustrate the behavior of flux and linear
polarization versus time that such a model produces. The variations in
gamma-ray flux generated by the code are often, but not always, correlated with
those at lower frequencies, and many of the flares are sharply peaked. The mean
degree of polarization of synchrotron radiation is higher and its time-scale of
variability shorter toward higher frequencies, while the polarization electric
vector sometimes randomly executes apparent rotations. The slope of the
spectral energy distribution exhibits sharper breaks than can arise solely from
energy losses. All of these results correspond to properties observed in
blazars.

hyperluminous infrared galaxy (HyLIRG) with a total infrared luminosity of
log10(LIR/L0)=13.90+/-0.02. A greybody fit gives a dust temperature of
Td=60+/-3K assuming an emissivity index of beta=1.5, considerably higher than
in submillimeter bright galaxies observed at similar redshifts. The star
formation rate is estimated to be >2000M0/yr even accounting for a significant
contribution from an AGN component to the total infrared luminosity or
requiring that only the far infra-red luminosity is powered by a starburst.
XMM-Newton observations constrain the hard X-ray luminosity to be
L(2-10keV)=1.3e45 erg/s putting ULASJ1234+0907 among the brightest X-ray
quasars known. Through very deep optical and near infra-red imaging of the
field at sub-arcsecond seeing, we demonstrate that despite its extreme
luminosity, it is highly unlikely that ULASJ1234+0907 is being lensed. We
measure a neutral hydrogen column density of NH=9e21/cm^2 corresponding to AV~6
mags. The observed properties of ULASJ1234+0907 - high luminosity and Eddington
ratio, broad lines, moderate column densities and significant infra-red
emission from re-processed dust - are similar to those predicted by galaxy
formation simulations for the AGN blowout phase. The high Eddington ratio
combined with the presence of significant amounts of dust in this quasar, is
expected to drive strong outflows due to the effects of radiation pressure on
dust. We conclude that ULASJ1234+0907 is a prototype galaxy caught at the peak
epoch of galaxy formation, which is transitioning from a starburst to optical
quasar via a dusty quasar phase.

are singlets, then there can be mixing between the additional gauge boson and
the hypercharge gauge boson. This can lead to a very light, but weakly coupled
""dark"" gauge boson, the $Z_d$, with a mass of O(1) GeV. If the $Z_d$ gets its
mass entirely from a Higgs singlet, it is called a dark photon; whereas if
there is a second Higgs doublet, it is called a dark Z. We look at charged
Higgs boson decays in the dark Z model. If the charged Higgs mass is between 90
GeV and 170 GeV, then its dominant two-body decays are $H^+ \rightarrow \tau\
\nu\ $ and $H^+ \rightarrow W^+ Z_d$. The former is suppressed by the small tau
mass-squared and by $1/\tan^2 \beta$, whereas the latter is suppressed by a
loop and a small mixing. We find that for much of the allowed parameter-space
$H^+ \rightarrow W^+ Z_d$ will dominate. Since $Z_d$ decays to a lepton pair
much of the time, this leads (using Drell-Yan pair production) to $pp

tools for understanding the physics of unresolved systems from observation of
their integrated light. Models allow us to relate the integrated spectra (or
colours) of a system with the evolutionary status of the stars of which it is
composed and hence to infer how the system has evolved from its formation to
its present stage. On average, observational data follow model predictions, but
with some scatter, so that systems with the same physical parameters (age,
metallicity, total mass) produce a variety of integrated spectra. The fewer the
stars in a system, the larger is the scatter. Such scatter is sometimes much
larger than the observational errors, reflecting its physical nature. This
situation has led to the development in recent years (especially since 2010) of
Monte Carlo models of stellar populations. Some authors have proposed that such
models are more realistic than state-of-the-art standard synthesis codes that
produce the mean of the distribution of Monte Carlo models.
  In this review, I show that these two modelling strategies are actually
equivalent, and that they are not in opposition to each other. They are just
different ways of describing the probability distributions intrinsic in the
very modelling of stellar populations. I show the advantages and limitations of
each strategy and how they complement each other. I also show the implications
of the probabilistic description of stellar populations in the application of
models to observational data obtained with high-resolution observational
facilities. Finally, I outline some possible developments that could be
realized in stellar population modelling in the near future.

of the quadruply-lensed QSO to the two foreground galaxies with the observed

halos of the two galaxies, and the recorded absorber strength is typical of
what is seen in previous close QSO--galaxy pair studies. While the
multi-sightline study confirms the unity covering fraction of MgII absorbing
gas at rho < 50 kpc from star-forming disks, the galaxies also present two
contrasting examples of complex halo gas kinematics. Different models,
including a rotating disk, collimated outflows, and gaseous streams from either
accretion or tidal/ram-pressure stripping, are considered for comparisons with
the absorption-line observations, and infalling streams/stripped gas of width

  multivariate heavy-tail analysis",,,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipping industry, the phenomenon of
sloshing can lead to the occurrence of very high pressures in the tanks of the
vessel. The issue of modelling or estimating the probability of the
simultaneous occurrence of such extremal pressures is now crucial from the risk
assessment point of view. In this paper, heavy-tail modelling, widely used as a
conservative approach to risk assessment and corresponding to a worst-case risk
analysis, is applied to the study of sloshing. Multivariate heavy-tailed
distributions are considered, with Sloshing pressures investigated by means of
small-scale replica tanks instrumented with d >1 sensors. When attempting to
fit such nonparametric statistical models, one naturally faces computational
issues inherent in the phenomenon of dimensionality. The primary purpose of
this article is to overcome this barrier by introducing a novel methodology.
For d-dimensional heavy-tailed distributions, the structure of extremal
dependence is entirely characterised by the angular measure, a positive measure
on the intersection of a sphere with the positive orthant in Rd. As d
increases, the mutual extremal dependence between variables becomes difficult
to assess. Based on a spectral clustering approach, we show here how a low
dimensional approximation to the angular measure may be found. The
nonparametric method proposed for model sloshing has been successfully applied
to pressure data. The parsimonious representation thus obtained proves to be
very convenient for the simulation of multivariate heavy-tailed distributions,
allowing for the implementation of Monte-Carlo simulation schemes in estimating
the probability of failure. Besides confirming its performance on artificial
data, the methodology has been implemented on a real data set specifically
collected for risk assessment of sloshing in the LNG shipping industry.

the CMB angular power spectrum, approximately up to $l=30$, is significantly
lower than the theoretically predicted in the best fit $\Lambda$CDM model. In
this paper we investigate the possibility of invoking the Integrated
Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect to explain this power deficit at low multipoles. The
ISW effect that originates from the late time expansion history of the universe
is rich in possibilities given the limited understanding of the origin of dark
energy (DE). It is a common understanding that the ISW effect adds to the power
at the low multipoles of the CMB angular power spectrum. In this paper we carry
out an analytic study to show that there are some expansion histories in which
the ISW effect, instead of adding power, provides negative contribution to the
power at low multipoles. Guided by the analytic study, we present examples of
the features required in the late time expansion history of the universe that
could explain the power deficiency through the ISW effect. We also show that an
ISW origin of power deficiency is consistent, at present, with other
cosmological observations that probe the expansion history such as distance
modulus, matter power spectrum and the evolution of cluster number count. We
also show that the ISW effect may be distinguished from power deficit
originating from features in the PPS using the measurements of the CMB
polarization spectrum at low multipoles expected from Planck. We conclude that
the power at low multipoles of the CMB anisotropy could well be closely linked
to Dark Energy puzzle in cosmology and this observation could be actually
pointing to richer phenomenology of DE beyond the cosmological constant
$\Lambda$. (abbreviated)

contribution directly proportional to the momentum space separation between the

sampling strategies that increase computational efficiency and mitigate the

consistency, which helps explain the potential pitfalls of applying DMD to
rank-deficient datasets, illustrating with examples. Such computations are not

model that was studied by Gibbons and Tirthapura (GT). In the solution for
maintaining an $(\epsilon,\delta)$-estimate, as what GT's method does, we make
the following new contributions: (1) For a bit stream of size $n$, where each
bit has a probability at least $\gamma$ to be 1, we exponentially reduced the
average total processing time from GT's $\Theta(n \log(1/\delta))$ to
$O((1/(\gamma\epsilon^2))(\log^2 n) \log(1/\delta))$, thus providing the first
sublinear-time streaming algorithm for this problem. (2) In addition to an
overall much faster processing speed, our method provides a new tradeoff that a
lower accuracy demand (a larger value for $\epsilon$) promises a faster
processing speed, whereas GT's processing speed is $\Theta(n \log(1/\delta))$
in any case and for any $\epsilon$. (3) The worst-case total time cost of our
method matches GT's $\Theta(n\log(1/\delta))$, which is necessary but rarely
occurs in our method. (4) The space usage overhead in our method is a lower
order term compared with GT's space usage and occurs only $O(\log n)$ times
during the stream processing and is too negligible to be detected by the
operating system in practice. We further validate these solid theoretical
results with experiments on both real-world and synthetic data, showing that
our method is faster than GT's by a factor of several to several thousands
depending on the stream size and accuracy demands, without any detectable space
usage overhead. Our method is based on a faster sampling technique that we
design for boosting GT's method and we believe this technique can be of other

high radio flux densities and associated faint or even absent infrared and
optical counterparts. The resulting extremely high radio-to-infrared flux
density ratios up to several thousands were previously known only for
High-redshift Radio Galaxies (HzRGs), suggesting a link between the two classes
of object. Prior to this work, no redshift was known for any IFRS in the
Australia Telescope Large Area Survey (ATLAS) fields which would help to put
IFRS in the context of other classes of object, especially of HzRGs. Aims: This
work aims at measuring the first redshifts of IFRS in the ATLAS fields.
Further, we test the hypothesis that IFRS are similar to HzRGs, as
higher-redshift or dust-obscured versions of these massive galaxies. Methods: A
sample of IFRS was spectroscopically observed using the Focal Reducer and Low
Dispersion Spectrograph 2 (FORS2) at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The data
were calibrated based on the Image Reduction and Analysis Facility (IRAF) and
redshifts extracted. This information was then used to calculate rest-frame
luminosities, and to perform the first spectral energy distribution modelling
of IFRS based on redshifts. Results: We found redshifts of 1.84, 2.13, and
2.76, for three IFRS, confirming the suggested high-redshift character of this
class of object. These redshifts as well as the resulting luminosities show
IFRS to be similar to HzRGs. We found further evidence that fainter IFRS are at
even higher redshifts. Conclusions: Considering the similarities between IFRS
and HzRGs substantiated in this work, the detection of IFRS, which have a
significantly higher sky density than HzRGs, increases the number of Active
Galactic Nuclei in the early universe and adds to the problems of explaining
the formation of supermassive black holes shortly after the Big Bang.

backlogged transmitter with a finite capacity battery; ii) energy maximization,
in which the remaining energy in an infinite capacity battery by a deadline is
maximized such that all the arriving data packets are delivered; iii)
transmission completion time minimization, in which the delivery time of all

optimal transmission policies are identified, and an algorithm which computes
an optimal transmission policy is proposed. Finally, based on the insights

quantum states involving interference, decrease (or increase) monotonically as
a function of increased distinguishability. Distinguishability, in turn, can be
a consequence of decoherence, for example caused by the (simultaneous) loss of
excitation or due to inadequate mode matching (either deliberate or
indeliberate). It is known that for some cases of multi-photon interference,
non-monotonic decay of projection probabilities occurs, which has so far been
attributed to interference between four or more two photons. We show that such
a non-monotonic behaviour of projection probabilities is not unnatural, and can
also occur for single-photon and even semiclassical states. Thus, while the
effect traces its roots from indistinguishability and thus interference, the
states for which this can be observed do not need to have particular quantum
features.

Binary-optical system exhibiting anti-resolution (AR) is designed and
fabricated, by which electromagnetic energy flux avoids and bends smoothly
around a nearly perfect darkness region. AR remains an unexplored topic
hitherto, in contrast to the super-resolution for realizing high spatial
resolution. This novel scheme replies on smearing out the PSF and thus poses
less stringent limitations upon the object's size and position since the
created dark (zero-field) area reach 8 orders of magnitude larger than the
square of wavelength in size. It functions very well at arbitrarily polarized
beams in three dimensions, which is also frequency-scalable in the whole

send messages securely to a receiver in the presence of a hybrid half-duplex
adversary, which arbitrarily decides to either jam or eavesdrop the
transmitter-to- receiver channel. We provide bounds to the secrecy capacity for
various possibilities on receiver feedback and show special cases where the
bounds are tight. We show that, without any feedback from the receiver, the
secrecy capacity is zero if the transmitter-to-adversary channel stochastically
dominates the effective transmitter-to-receiver channel. However, the secrecy
capacity is non-zero even when the receiver is allowed to feed back only one
bit at the end of each block. Our novel achievable strategy improves the rates
proposed in the literature for the non-hybrid adversarial model. We also
analyze the effect of multiple adversaries and delay constraints on the secrecy
capacity. We show that our novel time sharing approach leads to positive
secrecy rates even under strict delay constraints.

perturbed by a variety of sources. In research, emphasis has been put on
operational space vehicles. Operational satellites typically have a relatively
compact shape, and hence, a low area-to-mass ratio (AMR), and are in most cases
actively or passively attitude stabilized. This enables one to treat the orbit
and attitude propagation as decoupled problems, and in many cases the attitude
dynamics can be neglected completely. The situation is different for space
debris objects, which are in an uncontrolled attitude state. Furthermore, the
assumption that a steady-state attitude motion can be averaged over data
reduction intervals may no longer be valid. Additionally, a subset of the
debris objects have significantly high area-to-mass ratio values, resulting in
highly perturbed orbits, e.g. by solar radiation pressure, even if a stable AMR
value is assumed. This assumption implies a steady-state attitude such that the
average cross-sectional area exposed to the sun is close to constant.
Time-varying solar radiation pressure accelerations due to attitude variations
will result in un-modeled errors in the state propagation. This work
investigates the evolution of the coupled attitude and orbit motion of HAMR
objects. Standardized pieces of multilayer insulation are simulated in near
geosynchronous orbits. It is assumed that the objects are rigid bodies and are
in uncontrolled attitude states. The integrated effects of the Earth
gravitational field and solar radiation pressure on the attitude motion are
investigated. The light curves that represent the observed brightness
variations over time in a specific viewing direction are extracted. A sensor
model is utilized to generate light curves with visibility constraints and
magnitude uncertainties as observed by a standard ground based telescope.

framework of analysis of geodesic flows in Riemannian geometry and Relativity.
After setting up the general formalism, we explore it through studies on
various one and two dimensional systems. Quantities like expansion, shear and
rotation (ESR), which are more familiar to the relativist, now re-appear while
studying such families of trajectories in configuration space, in very simple
mechanical systems. The convergence/divergence of a family of trajectories
during the course of time evolution, the shear and twist of the area enclosing
the family, and the focusing/defocusing of the trajectories within a finite
time are investigated analytically for these systems. The understanding of the
configuration space developed through such investigations is elaborated upon,
and possible future avenues are pointed out.

on local descriptors, leading to many powerful algorithms. However,
preprocessing techniques have received much less attention despite their
important potential for improving the overall classification performance. We
address this question by proposing a novel, simple, yet very powerful
biologically-inspired filtering (BF) which simulates the performance of human
retina. In the proposed approach, given a texture image, after applying a DoG
filter to detect the ""edges"", we first split the filtered image into two ""maps""
alongside the sides of its edges. The feature extraction step is then carried
out on the two ""maps"" instead of the input image. Our algorithm has several
advantages such as simplicity, robustness to illumination and noise, and
discriminative power. Experimental results on three large texture databases
show that with an extremely low computational cost, the proposed method
improves significantly the performance of many texture classification systems,
notably in noisy environments. The source codes of the proposed algorithm can
be downloaded from https://sites.google.com/site/nsonvu/code.

description of the folding landscape so that the barriers and time scales for
the conformational change in the switching region in the aptamer can be
estimated. Using a combination of all atom molecular dynamics and
coarse-grained model simulations we studied the response of adenine (A) binding
add and pbuE A-riboswitches to mechanical force. The two riboswitches contain a
structurally similar three-way junction formed by three paired helices, P1, P2,
and P3, but carry out different functions. Using pulling simulations, with
structures generated in MD simulations, we show that after P1 rips the dominant
unfolding pathway in add A-riboswitch is the rupture of P2 followed by
unraveling of P3. In the pbuE A-riboswitch, after P1 unfolds P3 ruptures ahead
of P2. The order of unfolding of the helices, which is in accord with single
molecule pulling experiments, is determined by the relative stabilities of the
individual helices. Our results show that the stability of isolated helices
determines the order of assembly and response to force in these non-coding
regions. We use the simulated free energy profile for pbuE A-riboswitch to
estimate the time scale for allosteric switching, which shows that this
riboswitch is under kinetic control lending additional support to the
conclusion based on single molecule pulling experiments. A consequence of the
stability hypothesis is that a single point mutation (U28C) in the P2 helix of
the add A-riboswitch, which increases the stability of P2, would make the
folding landscapes of the two riboswitches similar. This prediction can be
tested in single molecule pulling experiments.

'd-critical stack' $(X',s)$ in the sense of arXiv:1304.4508.
  (c) If $(X,s)$ is an oriented d-critical stack, we can define a natural
perverse sheaf $P^\bullet_{X,s}$ on $X$, such that whenever $T$ is a scheme and
$t:T\to X$ is smooth of relative dimension $n$, then $T$ is locally modelled on
a critical locus Crit$(f:U\to{\mathbb A}^1)$ for $U$ smooth, and
$t^*(P^\bullet_{X,s})[n]$ is locally modelled on the perverse sheaf of
vanishing cycles $PV_{U,f}^\bullet$ of $f$.
  (d) If $(X,s)$ is a finite type oriented d-critical stack, we can define a
natural motive $MF_{X,s}$ in a ring of motives $\bar{\mathcal
M}^{st,\hat\mu}_X$ on $X$, such that whenever $T$ is a finite type scheme and
$t:T\to X$ is smooth of dimension $n$, then $T$ is locally modelled on a

Usually, the aspect ratio of a condensate is inverted due to the anisotropy of
the uncertainty principle. In turbulent BECs, however, the aspect ratio remains
constant. The reason for this phenomenon is still unknown, being a challenging
topic in the study of quantum turbulence. Here, the two-dimensional
Gross-Pitaevskii equation is solved and the time development of the aspect
ratio and of the radii of the condensates are calculated in the presence of
vortices. The results indicate that vortex pairs must be added to a condensate
in order to expand it while maintaining its aspect ratio. The anisotropy due to
the vortex pairs competes with that due to the uncertainty principle so that
the aspect ratio remains constant.

processes of the photo-dissociation of the molecular ions H$_{2}^{+}$ and

$X$ denotes the metal atom. As the continuation of the previous investigation,
these processes are considered also within the corresponding sunspot model. In
this work the non-symmetric ion-atom absorption processes are considered with
$X=$ Mg, Si, etc. It was analyzed the significance of such processes in far UV

especially with the processes of the photo-ionization of the metal atoms (Na,
Mg, Ca, etc.) which were not included in the consideration in the case of the

Analysis of all possible probabilistic couplings for a given set of random

no two edges of $T$ are assigned the same color. A {\em $k$-rainbow coloring}of
$G$ is an edge coloring of $G$ having the property that for every set $S$ of
$k$ vertices of $G$, there exists a rainbow tree $T$ in $G$ such that
$S\subseteq V(T)$. The minimum number of colors needed in a $k$-rainbow
coloring of $G$ is the {\em $k$-rainbow index of $G$}, denoted by $rx_k(G)$.
Graph operations, both binary and unary, are an interesting subject, which can
be used to understand structures of graphs. In this paper, we will study the
$3$-rainbow index with respect to three important graph product operations
(namely cartesian product, strong product, lexicographic product) and other
graph operations. In this direction, we firstly show if $G^*=G_1\Box
G_2\cdots\Box G_k$ ($k\geq 2$), where each $G_i$ is connected, then
$rx_3(G^*)\leq \sum_{i=1}^{k} rx_3(G_i)$. Moreover, we also present a condition
and show the above equality holds if every graph $G_i (1\leq i\leq k)$ meets
the condition. As a corollary, we obtain an upper bound for the 3-rainbow index
of strong product. Secondly, we discuss the 3-rainbow index of the
lexicographic graph $G[H]$ for connected graphs $G$ and $H$. The proofs are
constructive and hence yield the sharp bound. Finally, we consider the
relationship between the 3-rainbow index of original graphs and other simple
graph operations : the join of $G$ and $H$, split a vertex of a graph and
subdivide an edge.

transition at finite temperature is a necessary condition for the baryogenesis,
it is important to study the nature of finite temperature phase transition.
Applying the reweighting method, the probability distribution function of the
plaquette is calculated in the many-flavor QCD. Through the shape of the
distribution function, we determine the critical mass of heavy flavors
terminating the first order region, and find it to become larger with Nf. We

cascades, in the IceCube-40 detector. The data for this search was collected
between April 2008 and May 2009 when the first 40 IceCube strings were deployed
and operational. Three complementary searches were performed, each optimized
for different energy regimes. The analysis with the lowest energy threshold (2
TeV) targeted atmospheric neutrinos. A total of 67 events were found,
consistent with the expectation of 41 atmospheric muons and 30 atmospheric
neutrino events. The two other analyses targeted a harder, astrophysical
neutrino flux. The analysis with an intermediate threshold of 25 TeV lead to
the observation of 14 cascade-like events, again consistent with the prediction
of 3.0 atmospheric neutrino and 7.7 atmospheric muon events. We hence set an
upper limit of $E^2 \Phi_{lim} \leq 7.46\times10^{-8}\,\mathrm{GeV sr^{-1}
s^{-1} cm^{-2}}$ (90% C.L.) on the diffuse flux from astrophysical neutrinos of
all neutrino flavors, applicable to the energy range 25 TeV to 5 PeV, assuming
an $E_{\nu}^{-2}$ spectrum and a neutrino flavor ratio of 1:1:1 at the Earth.
The third analysis utilized a larger and optimized sample of atmospheric muon
background simulation, leading to a higher energy threshold of 100 TeV. Three
events were found over a background prediction of 0.04 atmospheric muon events
and 0.21 events from the flux of conventional and prompt atmospheric neutrinos.
Including systematic errors this corresponds to a $2.7\sigma$ excess with
respect to the background-only hypothesis. Our observation of neutrino event
candidates above 100 TeV complements IceCube's recently observed evidence for
high-energy astrophysical neutrinos.

The target is not a general dynamical map but a unitary operation; and the time

Large-deviation theory characterizes such rare events from the perspective of
stochastic processes. In most cases it is very difficult to directly determine
the large-deviation functions. Circumventing this necessity, I present a method
to quantify the fluctuation spectra for arbitrary Markovian models with finite
state space. Under non-equilibrium conditions, current-like observables are of
special interest. The space of all current-like observables has a natural
decomposition into orthogonal complements. Remarkably, the fluctuation spectrum
of any observable is entirely determined by only one of these components. The
method is applied to study differences of fluctuations in setups sampling the
same dynamics at different resolutions. Coarse graining relates these models
and can be done in a way that preserves expectation values of observables.
However, the effects of the coarse graining on the fluctuations are not
obvious. These differences are explicitly worked out for a simple model system.

simple, yet widely used model for interference. Under this model, when
transmitters cause interference at any of the receivers, their collided packets
are discarded and need to be retransmitted. However, in reality, that receiver
can still store its analog received signal and utilize it for decoding the
packets in the future (for example, by successive interference cancellation
techniques). In this work, we propose a physical layer model for wireless
packet networks that allows for such flexibility at the receivers. We assume
that the transmitters will be aware of the state of the channel (i.e. when and
where collisions occur, or an unintended receiver overhears the signal) with
some delay, and propose several coding opportunities that can be utilized by
the transmitters to exploit the available signal at the receivers for
interference management (as opposed to discarding them). We analyze the
achievable throughput of our strategy in a canonical interference channel with
two transmitter-receiver pairs, and demonstrate the gain over conventional
schemes. By deriving an outer-bound, we also prove the optimality of our scheme
for the corresponding model.

explain, on a yearly basis, high season ARI data in terms of the contact rates

high season is a transient regime of a noisy system, e.g., the system is driven
away from equilibrium every year by fluctuations in variables such as humidity,
temperature, viral mutations and human behavior. Using the value of the
replacement number as a phenotypic trait associated to fitness, we provide
evidence that influenza and RSV coexists throughout the ARI high season through
superinfection.

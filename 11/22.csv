range. For the stabilization of 3-valent cerium in ceramic phosphors such as
calcium scandate CaSc2O4, often co-doping with sodium for charge compensation
is performed (Na+, Ce3+ = 2 Ca2+). At the melting point of CaSc2O4 (ca. 2110
deg C), however, alkaline oxides evaporate completely and co-doping is thus no
option for crystal growth from the melt. It is shown that even without
co-doping Ce3+:CaSc2O4 crystal fibers can be grown from the melt by
laser-heated pedestal growth (LHPG) in a suitable reactive atmosphere. Reactive
means here that the oxygen partial pressure is a function of temperature and
pO2(T) rises for this atmosphere in such a way that Ce3+ is kept stable for all
T. Crystal fibers with ca. 1 mm diameter and up to 50 mm length were grown and
characterized. Differential thermal analysis (DTA) was performed in the
pseudo-binary system CaO-Sc2O3, and the specific heat capacity cp(T) of CaSc2O4
was measured up to 1240 K by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Near and
beyond the melting point of calcium scandate significant evaporation of calcium
tends to shift the melt composition towards the Sc2O3 side. Measurements and
thermodynamic calculations reveal quantitative data on the fugacities of
evaporating species.

rate is negative below a certain critical population size can cause high
extinction probabilities in small introduced populations. However, many species
are repeatedly introduced to the same location and eventually one population
may overcome the Allee effect by chance. With the help of stochastic models, we
investigate how much genetic diversity such successful populations harbour on
average and how this depends on offspring-number variation, an important source
of stochastic variability in population size. We find that with increasing
variability, the Allee effect increasingly promotes genetic diversity in
successful populations. Successful Allee-effect populations with highly
variable population dynamics escape rapidly from the region of small population
sizes and do not linger around the critical population size. Therefore, they
are exposed to relatively little genetic drift. We show that here---unlike in
classical population genetics models---the role of offspring-number variation
cannot be accounted for by an effective-population-size correction. Thus, our
results highlight the importance of detailed biological knowledge, in this case
on the probability distribution of family sizes, when predicting the
evolutionary potential of newly founded populations or when using genetic data
to reconstruct their demographic history.

the corresponding $R_{pA}$ and $R_{dA}$ and their azimuthal anisotropy. The
high-$p_t$ $V_n$ provide a set of clean indicators of final state energy loss.
In particular we find in the most central pPb (5.02 TeV) and dAu (200 GeV)

possible 'Standard Halo Model' for the Milky Way (MW) halo in which the
velocity distribution is Maxwellian. This model assumes that the MW halo is an
isotropic, isothermal sphere, hypotheses that are unlikely to be valid in
reality. An alternative approach is to derive a self-consistent solution for a
particular mass model of the MW (i.e. obtained from its gravitational
potential) using the Eddington formalism, which assumes isotropy. In this paper
we extend this approach to incorporate an anisotropic phase-space distribution
function. We perform Bayesian scans over the parameters defining the mass model
of the MW and parameterising the phase-space density, implementing constraints
from a wide range of astronomical observations. The scans allow us to estimate
the precision reached in the reconstruction of the velocity distribution (for
different DM halo profiles). As expected, allowing for an anisotropic velocity
tensor increases the uncertainty in the reconstruction of f(v) but the
distribution can still be determined with a precision of a factor of 4-5. The
mean velocity distribution resembles the isotropic case, however the amplitude
of the high-velocity tail is up to a factor of 2 larger. Our results agree with
the phenomenological parametrization proposed in Mao et al. (2013) as a good
fit to N-body simulations (with or without baryons), since their velocity
distribution is contained in our 68% credible interval.

happens. Inflow and outflow signatures of the magnetic reconnection process are
identified, and the thereby newly formed helical loops wind around pre-existing

biological processes with a period of about 24 h called circadian (from the

anticipate the daily alternation of light and darkness. Experiments carried out
in cyanobacteria have shown the adaptive value of circadian clocks. In these
experiments a wild type cyanobacterial strain (with a 24 h circadian rhythm)
and a mutant strain (with a longer or shorter period) grow in competition. In
different experiments the external light dark cycle was changed in order to
match the circadian period of the different strains, revealing that the strain
whose circadian period matches the light-dark has a larger fitness. As a
consequence the initial population of one strain grows while the other decays.
  These experiments were made under fixed light and dark intervals. However, in
Nature this relationship changes according to the season. Therefore, seasonal
changes in light could affect the results of the competition. Using a
theoretical model we analyze how modulation of light can change the survival of
the different cyanobacterial strains. Our results show that there is a clear
shift in the competition due to the modulation of light, which could be

non-linear description of the growth of the large-scale structure of the

described as a unique hot fluid, it is shown that the overall neutrino fluid
can be equivalently decomposed into a collection of independent flows. Starting
either from elementary conservation equations or from the evolution equation of
the phase-space distribution function, we derive the two non-linear motion
equations that each of these flows satisfies. Those fluid equations describe
the evolution of macroscopic fields. We explain in detail the connection
between the collection of flows we defined and the standard massive neutrino
fluid. Then, in the particular case of adiabatic initial conditions, we
explicitly check that, at linear order, the resolution of this new system of
equations reproduces the results obtained in the standard approach based on the
collisionless Boltzmann hierarchy. Besides, the approach advocated in this
paper allows to show how each neutrino flow settles into the cold dark matter
flow depending on initial velocities. It opens the way to a fully non-linear
treatment of the dynamical evolution of neutrinos in the framework of

direct matching to the stellar masses of observed Local Group dwarf galaxies,
allowing the determination of the slope of the stellar mass-halo mass relation
for low mass galaxies. Errors in halo masses are well defined as the Poisson
noise of simulated local group realisations, which we determine using
constrained local universe simulations (CLUES). For the stellar mass range
10$^7$<M*<10$^8$M$_\odot$, for which we likely have a complete census of
observed galaxies, we find that the stellar mass-halo mass relation follows a
power law with slope of 3.1, significantly steeper than most values in the
literature. The steep relation between stellar and halo masses indicates that
Local Group dwarf galaxies are hosted by dark matter halos with a small range
of mass. Our methodology is robust down to the stellar mass to which the census
of observed Local Group galaxies is complete, but the significant uncertainty
in the currently measured slope of the stellar-to halo mass relation will
decrease dramatically if the Local Group completeness limit was
$10^{6.5}$M$\odot$ or below, highlighting the importance of pushing such limit
to lower masses and larger volumes.

comprised of knots, head-tail, and linear stellar features. The only H-alpha
emission arises from a few HII regions in the tail, the brightest of which are
at the heads of head-tail UV sources whose tails point toward the galaxy
(""fireballs""). Several of the elongated tail sources have H-alpha peaks
outwardly offset by 80-150 pc from the UV peaks, suggesting that gas clumps
continue to accelerate through ram pressure, leaving behind streams of newly
formed stars which have decoupled from the gas. Absorption line strengths,
measured from Keck DEIMOS spectra, together with UV colors, show star formation
stopped 300+/-100 Myr ago in the main body, and a strong starburst occurred
prior to quenching. While neither H-alpha nor HI emission are detected in the
main body of the galaxy, we have detected 4x10^7 M_sun of HI from the tail with
the VLA. The gas consumption timescale in the tail is relatively long, implying
that most of the stripped gas does not form stars but joins the ICM. The
velocities of tail HII regions, measured from Keck LRIS spectra, extend only a
small fraction of the way to the cluster velocity, suggesting that star
formation does not happen in more distant parts of the tail. Stars in the outer
tail have velocities exceeding the escape speed, but some in the inner tail
should fall back into the galaxy, forming halo streams. One likely fallback
stream is identified.

of attracting new ones, retaining old ones and/or accepting new products or
services through the leverage of mutual influences. The communities of users
are smaller units, easier to grasp, and allow for example the computation of
role analysis -- based on the centrality of an actor within his community.
  The problem of finding communities in static graphs has been widely studied.
However, from the point of view of a telecom analyst, to be really useful, the
detected communities must evolve as the social graph of communications changes
over time -- for example, in order to perform marketing actions on communities
and track the results of those actions over time. Additionally the behaviors of
communities of users over time can be used to predict future activity that
interests the telecom operators, such as subscriber churn or handset adoption.
Similary group evolution can provide insights for designing strategies, such as
the early warning of group churn.
  Stability is a crucial issue: the analysis performed on a given community
will be lost, if the analyst cannot keep track of this community in the
following time steps. This is the particular use case that we tackle in this
paper: tracking the evolution of communities in dynamic scenarios with focus on
stability.
  We propose two modifications to a widely used static community detection
algorithm. We then describe experiments to study the stability and quality of
the resulting partitions on real-world social networks, represented by monthly
call graphs for millions of subscribers.

in any $d$-dimensional Hilbert space and for any pair of non-commuting
operators, $A$ and $B$, there exists a set of at least $2^{d-1}$ zero-noise,
zero-disturbance (ZNZD) states, for which the first observable can be measured
without noise and the second will not be disturbed. Moreover, we show that it
is possible to construct such ZNZD states for which the expectation value of
the commutator $[A,B]$ does not vanish. Therefore any state-dependent
error-disturbance relation, based on the expectation value of the commutator as
a lower bound, must violate the operational requirement. We also discuss
Ozawa's state-dependent error-disturbance relation in light of our results and
show that the disturbance measure used in this relation exhibits unphysical
properties. We conclude that the trade-off is inevitable only between
state-independent measures of error and disturbance.

the present work a similar, more general, universality is shown to hold true
for all rotating neutron stars within General Relativity; the first four
multipole moments of the neutron star are related in a way independent of the
nuclear matter equation of state we assume. By exploiting this relation, we can
describe quite accurately the geometry around a neutron star with fewer
parameters, even if we don't know precisely the equation of state. Furthermore,
this universal behavior displayed by neutron stars, could promote them to a
more promising class of candidates (next to black holes) for testing theories
of gravity.

variable, neutron star high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB). Two observations were
taken at similar orbital phases but separated by nearly a year. They show very
different 3-79 keV flux levels as well as strong variability during each
observation, covering almost one order of magnitude in flux. These observations
allow, for the first time ever, investigations on kilo-second time-scales of
how the centroid energies of cyclotron resonant scattering features (CRSFs)
depend on flux for a persistent HMXB. We find that the line energy of the
harmonic CRSF is correlated with flux, as expected in the sub-critical
accretion regime. We argue that Vela X-1 has a very narrow accretion column
with a radius of around 0.4 km that sustains a Coulomb interaction dominated
shock at the observed luminosities of Lx ~ 3x10^36 erg/s. Besides the prominent
harmonic line at 55 keV the fundamental line around 25 keV is clearly detected.
We find that the strengths of the two CRSFs are anti-correlated, which we
explain by photon spawning. This anti-correlation is a possible explanation for
the debate about the existence of the fundamental line. The ratio of the line
energies is variable with time and deviates significantly from 2.0, also a
possible consequence of photon spawning, which changes the shape of the line.
During the second observation, Vela X-1 showed a short off-state in which the
power-law softened and a cut-off was no longer measurable. It is likely that
the source switched to a different accretion regime at these low mass accretion
rates, explaining the drastic change in spectral shape.

and treating the interference from each other as noise is
information-theoretically optimal (to within a constant gap). Based on this
concept, we develop a new spectrum sharing mechanism, called
""information-theoretic link scheduling"" (ITLinQ), which at each time schedules
those links that form an ITIS. We first provide a performance guarantee for
ITLinQ by characterizing the fraction of the capacity region that it can
achieve in a network with sources and destinations located randomly within a
fixed area. Furthermore, we demonstrate how ITLinQ can be implemented in a
distributed manner, using an initial 2-phase signaling mechanism which provides
the required channel state information at all the links. Through numerical
analysis, we show that distributed ITLinQ can outperform similar
state-of-the-art spectrum sharing mechanisms, such as FlashLinQ, by more than a
100% of sum-rate gain, while keeping the complexity at the same level. Finally,
we discuss a variation of the distributed ITLinQ scheme which can also
guarantee fairness among the links in the network and numerically evaluate its

provide data on the neutron flux in the upper stratosphere at high latitudes at
thermal and nonthermal energies for the PoGOLite instrument. PoGOLite is a
balloon borne hard X-ray polarimeter for which the main source of background
stems from high energy neutrons. No measurements of the neutron environment for
the planned flight latitude and altitude exist. Furthermore this neutron
environment changes with altitude, latitude and solar activity, three variables
that will vary throughout the PoGOLite flight. PoGOLino was developed to study
the neutron environment and the influences from these three variables upon it.
PoGOLino consists of two Europium doped Lithium Calcium Aluminium Fluoride
(Eu:LiCAF) scintillators, each of which is sandwiched between 2 Bismuth
Germanium Oxide (BGO) scintillating crystals, which serve to veto signals
produced by gamma-rays and charged particles. This allows the neutron flux to
be measured even in high radiation environments. Measurements of neutrons in
two separate energy bands are achieved by placing one LiCAF detector inside a
moderating polyethylene shield while the second detector remains unshielded.
The PoGOLino instrument was launched on March 20th 2013 from the Esrange Space
Center in Northern Sweden to an altitude of 30.9 km. A description of the
detector design and read-out system is presented. A detailed set of simulations
of the atmospheric neutron environment performed using both PLANETOCOSMICS and
Geant4 will also be described. The comparison of the neutron flux measured
during flight to predictions based on these simulations will be presented and
the consequences for the PoGOLite background will be discussed.

using the 1PI loop corrections, which may indicate that the quantum corrections

to be L(LyA)=1.07x10^42 erg s^-1, which corresponds to a star formation rate of
0.97 M_\odot yr^-1. Interestingly, the detected Lyman-alpha emission is
spatially extended with a sharp peak. The large extent of the Lyman-alpha
emission is remarkably one-sided toward the quasar line-of-sight, and is
redshifted. The observed spatially asymmetric surface brightness profile can be
qualitatively explained by a model of a DLA host galaxy, assuming a galactic
outflow and a clumpy distribution of HI clouds in the circumgalactic medium.
This large Lyman-alpha extension, which is similar to those found in Rauch et
al. (2008), could be the result of complicated anisotropic radiative transfer
through the surrounding neutral gas embedded in the DLA.

reduction method - named QUADRO (Quadratic Dimension Reduction via Rayleigh
Optimization) - for analyzing high- dimensional data. Unlike in the linear
setting where Rayleigh quotient optimization coincides with classification,
these two problems are very different under nonlinear settings. In this paper,
we clarify this difference and show that Rayleigh quotient optimization may be
of independent scientific interests. One major challenge of Rayleigh quotient
optimization is that the variance of quadratic statistics involves all fourth
cross-moments of predictors, which are infeasible to compute for
high-dimensional applications and may accumulate too many stochastic errors.
This issue is resolved by considering a family of elliptical models. Moreover,
for heavy-tail distributions, robust estimates of mean vectors and covariance
matrices are employed to guarantee uniform convergence in estimating
nonpolynomially many parameters, even though only the fourth moments are
assumed. Methodologically, QUADRO is based on elliptical models which allow us
to formulate the Rayleigh quotient maximization as a convex optimization
problem. Computationally, we propose an efficient linearized augmented
Lagrangian method to solve the constrained optimization problem. Theoretically,
we provide explicit rates of convergence in terms of Rayleigh quotient under
both Gaussian and general elliptical models. Thorough numerical results on both
synthetic and real datasets are also provided to back up our theoretical
results.

advantage of language workbenches is that they support the composition of

programs that can benefit from different levels of abstraction. We reasoned
that language workbenches could be useful to develop bioinformatics software

bioinformatics, we tested a prominent workbench by developing an alternative to
shell scripting. While shell scripts are widely used in bioinformatics to
automate computational analysis, existing scripting languages do not provide
many of the features present in modern programming languages. We report on our

advantages that language workbench technologies can bring to bioinformatics.

provides semantic error detection and can be compiled interactively with an
automatic build and deployment system. In contrast to shell scripts, NYoSh
scripts can be written in a modern development environment, supporting context

of course sensitive to structural anisotropies, but have been much less used as
a probe of more exotic symmetry breakings in ordered states. In this paper a
Jones transfer matrix formalism is discussed to infer the existence of exotic
broken symmetry states of matter from their electrodynamic response for a full
complement of possible broken symmetries including reflection, rotation,
rotation-reflection, inversion, and time-reversal. A specific condition to
distinguish the case of macroscopic time-reversal symmetry breaking is
particularly important as in a dynamical experiment like optics, one must
distinguish $reciprocity$ from time-reversal symmetry as dissipation violates
strict time-reversal symmetry of an experiment. Different forms of reciprocity
can be distinguished, but only one is a sufficient (but not necessary)
condition for macroscopic time-reversal symmetry breaking. I show the
constraints that a Jones matrix develops under the presence or absence of such
symmetries. These constraints typically appear in the form of an algebra
relating matrix elements or overall constraints (transposition, unitarity,
hermiticity, normality, etc.) on the form of the Jones matrix. I work out a
number of examples including the trivial case of a ferromagnet, and the less
trivial cases of magnetoelectrics and vector and scalar spin ""chiral"" states. I
show that the formalism can be used to demonstrate that Kerr rotation must be
absent in time-reversal symmetric chiral materials. The formalism here is
discussed with an eye towards its use in time-domain THz spectroscopy in

is, still nowadays, one of the main challenges in phylogenetics. Its
difficulties lie in considering not too restrictive evolutionary models, and
correctly dealing with the long-branch attraction problem. The correct
reconstruction of 4-taxon trees is crucial for making quartet-based methods
work and being able to recover large phylogenies.
  Results: In this paper we consider an expectation-maximization method for
maximizing the likelihood of (time nonhomogeneous) evolutionary Markov models
on trees. We study its success on reconstructing 4-taxon topologies and its
performance as input method in quartet-based phylogenetic reconstruction
methods such as QFIT and QuartetSuite. Our results show that the method
proposed here outperforms neighbor-joining and the usual (time-homogeneous
continuous-time) maximum likelihood methods on 4-leaved trees with
among-lineage instantaneous rate heterogeneity, and perform similarly to usual
continuous-time maximum-likelihood when data satisfies the assumptions of both
methods.
  Conclusions: The method presented in this paper is well suited for
reconstructing the topology of any number of taxa via quartet-based methods and
is highly accurate, specially regarding largely divergent trees and time
nonhomogeneous data.

(log(M/Msun)>10) compact star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at 2<z<3 to explore
whether they are progenitors of compact quiescent galaxies at z~2. The
optical/NIR and far-IR Spitzer/Herschel colors indicate that most compact SFGs
are heavily obscured. Nearly half (47%) host an X-ray bright AGN. In contrast,
only about 10% of other massive galaxies at that time host AGNs. Compact SFGs
have centrally-concentrated light profiles and spheroidal morphologies similar
to quiescent galaxies, and are thus strikingly different from other SFGs. Most
compact SFGs lie either within the SFR-M main sequence (65%) or below (30%), on
the expected evolutionary path towards quiescent galaxies. These results show
conclusively that galaxies become more compact before they lose their gas and
dust, quenching star formation. Using extensive HST photometry from CANDELS and
grism spectroscopy from the 3D-HST survey, we model their stellar populations
with either exponentially declining (tau) star formation histories (SFHs) or
physically-motivated SFHs drawn from semi-analytic models (SAMs). SAMs predict
longer formation timescales and older ages ~2 Gyr, which are nearly twice as
old as the estimates of the tau models. While both models yield good SED fits,
SAM SFHs better match the observed slope and zero point of the SFR-M main
sequence. Some low-mass compact SFGs (log(M/Msun)=10-10.6) have younger ages
but lower sSFRs than that of more massive galaxies, suggesting that the
low-mass galaxies reach the red sequence faster. If the progenitors of compact
SFGs are extended SFGs, state-of-the-art SAMs show that mergers and disk
instabilities are both able to shrink galaxies, but disk instabilities are more
frequent (60% versus 40%) and form more concentrated galaxies. We confirm this
result via high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations.

first time also the hydrodynamics of the intracluster and intragroup medium.
This allows us to assess how f(R) gravity alters the X-ray scaling relations of
clusters and how hydrostatic and dynamical mass estimates are biased when
modifications of gravity are ignored in their determination. We find that
velocity dispersions and intracluster medium temperatures are both increased by
up to 1/3 in f(R) gravity in low-mass halos, while the difference disappears in
massive objects. The mass scale of the transition depends on the background
value f_R0 of the scalar degree of freedom. These changes in temperature and
velocity dispersion alter the mass-temperature and X-ray luminosity-temperature
scaling relations and bias dynamical and hydrostatic mass estimates that do not
explicitly account for modified gravity towards higher values. Recently, a
relative enhancement of X-ray compared to weak lensing masses was found by the
Planck Collaboration (2013). We demonstrate that an explanation for this offset
may be provided by modified gravity and the associated bias effects, which
interestingly are of the required size. Finally, we find that the abundance of
subhalos at fixed cluster mass is only weakly affected by f(R) gravity.

thought. Within $\sim 27\,$degrees about the axis of symmetry of the edge the
density, temperature and pressure drop abruptly by factors of
$1.83^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$, $1.85^{+0.41}_{-0.41}$ and $3.4^{+0.8}_{-0.7}$,
respectively. This is inconsistent with the pressure equilibrium expected of a
cold front and we conclude that the edge is a shock front. We measure a Mach
number $M = 1.59^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$ and corresponding shock velocity $v_{\rm
shock}\simeq 2057\,$km/s. Using spectra collected at the MMT with the Hectospec
multi-object spectrograph we identify 328 spectroscopically confirmed cluster
members. Significantly, we find a local peak in the projected galaxy density
associated with a bright cluster galaxy which is located just ahead of the nose
of the shock. The data are consistent with a merger viewed within $\sim
23\,$degrees of the plane of the sky. The merging subclusters are now moving
apart along a north-south axis approximately $0.3\,$Gyr after a small impact
parameter core passage. The gas core of the secondary subcluster, which was
driving the shock, appears to have been disrupted by the merger. Without a
driving 'piston' we speculate that the shock is dying. Finally, we propose that
the diffuse radio emission near the shock is due to the revival of pre-existing
radio plasma which has been overrun by the shock.

find that the fraction of input power deposited into the ISM (the AGN coupling

broad agreement with galaxy formation models employing AGN feedback. However,
we find that in these early stages, this energy is deposited only in a small

of backflows arising within the extended cocoon generated by a relativistic AGN
jet within the ISM of its host galaxy, previously proposed as a mechanism for
self-regulating the gas accretion onto the central object. These backflows tend
later to be destabilized by the 3D dynamics, rather than by hydrodynamic

geometric distortions (including the Alcock-Paczynski effect) in the context of
the galaxy power spectrum measured in upcoming galaxy redshift surveys.
Information comes from both the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature and
the broadband power spectrum shape. Accurate modeling is required to extract
this information without introducing systematic biases in the result. We
consider an analytic model for the power spectrum of dark matter halos in
redshift space, based on the distribution function expansion, and compare with
halo clustering measured in N-body simulations. We forecast that the
distribution function model is sufficiently accurate to allow the inclusion of
broadband information on scales down to k~0.2 h/Mpc, with somewhat better
accuracy for higher bias halos. Compared with a BAO-only analysis with
reconstruction, including broadband shape information can improve unbiased
constraints on distance measures H(z) and D_A(z) by ~30% and 20%, respectively,
for a galaxy sample similar to the DESI luminous red galaxies. The gains in
precision are larger in the absence of BAO reconstruction. Furthermore,
including broadband shape information allows the measurement of structure
growth, through redshift-space distortions. For the same galaxy sample, the
distribution function model is able to constrain f*sigma_8 to ~2%, when
simultaneously fitting for H(z) and D_A(z). We discuss techniques to optimize
the analysis of the power spectrum, including removing modes near the
line-of-sight that are particularly challenging to model, and whether these
approaches can improve parameter constraints. We find that such techniques are
unlikely to significantly improve constraints on geometry, although they may
allow higher precision measurements of redshift-space distortions.

these, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, Sagittarius
A* (Sgr A*), presents the largest angular cross section. Thus far, these
studies have focused upon measurements of the black hole spin and the
validation of low-luminosity accretion models. However, a critical input into
the analysis of EHT data is the structure of the black hole spacetime, and thus
these observations provide the novel opportunity to test the applicability of
the Kerr metric to astrophysical black holes. Here we present the first
simulated images of a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) around Sgr
A* employing a quasi-Kerr metric that contains an independent quadrupole moment
in addition to the mass and spin that fully characterize a black hole in
general relativity. We show that these images can be significantly different
from the images of a RIAF around a Kerr black hole with the same spin and
demonstrate the feasibility of testing the no-hair theorem by constraining the
quadrupolar deviation from the Kerr metric with existing EHT data. Equally
important, we find that the disk inclination and spin orientation angles are
robust to the inclusion of additional parameters, providing confidence in
previous estimations assuming the Kerr metric based upon EHT observations.
However, at present the limits upon potential modifications of the Kerr metric
remain weak.

trajectories in the simulations through the shocks, and tracking the variations

strong, with substantial compression ratios, in contrast to earlier claims.
However, they are only moderately relativistic. We also show that the two
density enhancements resembling flow streams in their shape are in fact merely
post-shock compressions, as fluid trajectories cut across, rather than flow
along, them. The dissipation associated with the shocks is a substantial

electronic polarization mechanism via virtual electron hopping processes. We
apply this mechanism to the Hubbard model with spin-orbit couplings and/or the
corresponding spin model with significant Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM)
interactions, and compute the optical conductivity of VBS states on both ideal
and deformed Kagome lattices. In case of the deformed Kagome lattice, we study
the antiferromagnet, Rb$_2$Cu$_3$SnF$_{12}$ with the pinwheel VBS state. In
case of the ideal Kagome lattice, we explore the optical conductivity
signatures of the spin-triplet excitations for three VBS states with (1) a
12-site unit cell, (2) a 36-site unit cell with six-fold rotation symmetry, and
(3) a 36-site unit cell with three-fold rotation symmetry, respectively. We
find that increasing the DM interactions generally leads to broad and smooth
features in the optical conductivity with interesting experimental
consequences. The optical conductivity reflects the features of the
spin-triplet excitations that can be measured in future experiments.

approximation of the Paczynski-Wiita gravity to replace the simple Newtonian
gravity in our model formulation. A new dimensionless parameter s appears with
the physical meaning of the square of the ratio of the sound speed to the speed

polytropic index $\gamma>4/3$. Two (for small enough $s<1$) or no (for large
enough $s<1$) expansion-wave collapse solutions (EWCSs) with central event
horizons exist when $\gamma>4/3$, representing the collapse of static singular
GP spheres towards the central singularity of spacetime. Such GP spherical
dynamic mass collapse is shown to be highly efficient for the rapid formation
of supermassive black holes (SMBHs; mass range of $10^6-10^{10}M_{\odot}$) in
the early universe or even hypermassive black holes (HMBHs; mass range of
$10^{10}-10^{12}M_{\odot}$) if extremely massive mass reservoirs could be

peaked at about 1 - 10 TeV and may originate from a diffuse population of
sources located in the Galactic arms. For the first time, we compute the energy
required to sustain such a relevant positron flux in the Galaxy, finding that
it is naturally compatible with an astrophysical origin. We considered several
reference propagation setups; we find that models with a low (or null)
reacceleration - tuned against light nuclei data - nicely describe both PAMELA
leptonic and hadronic data with no need to introduce a low-energy break in the
proton and helium spectra, as it would be required for high reacceleration

absolute spectra recently measured by AMS-02. We find that those data,
differently from what is inferred from the positron fraction alone, favor a
high energy cutoff (about 10 TeV) of the extra component if this is uniquely

field of computational statistical physics, and they have revealed many
properties of the model over the past few decades. However, the effect of
frustration due to random disorder, in particular the possible spin glass
phase, remains a crucial but poorly understood problem. One of the obstacles in
the Monte Carlo simulation of random frustrated systems is their long
relaxation time making an efficient parallel implementation on state-of-the-art
computation platforms highly desirable. The Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is
such a platform that provides an opportunity to significantly enhance the
computational performance and thus gain new insight into this problem. In this
paper, we present optimization and tuning approaches for the CUDA
implementation of the spin glass simulation on GPUs. We discuss the integration
of various design alternatives, such as GPU kernel construction with minimal
communication, memory tiling, and look-up tables. We present a binary data
format, Compact Asynchronous Multispin Coding (CAMSC), which provides an
additional $28.4\%$ speedup compared with the traditionally used Asynchronous
Multispin Coding (AMSC). Our overall design sustains a performance of 33.5
picoseconds per spin flip attempt for simulating the three-dimensional
Edwards-Anderson model with parallel tempering, which significantly improves
the performance over existing GPU implementations.

behavior of weak solutions to a kinetic flocking model coupled to the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The model describes the motion of
particles immersed in a Navier-Stokes fluid interacting through local
alignment. We first prove the existence of weak solutions using energy and
$L^p$ estimates together with the velocity averaging lemma. We also rigorously
establish a hydrodynamic limit corresponding to strong noise and local
alignment. In this limit, the dynamics can be totally described by a coupled
compressible Euler - incompressible Navier-Stokes system. The proof is via
relative entropy techniques. Finally, we show a conditional result on the
large-time behavior of classical solutions. Specifically, if the mass-density
satisfies a uniform in time integrability estimate, then particles align with
the fluid velocity exponentially fast without any further assumption on the
viscosity of the fluid.

that our models easily fits the observed gamma-ray spectrum for NGC 253 while
constraining the cosmic ray source spectral index and acceleration efficiency.
However, we encountered difficultly modeling the observed radio data and
constraining the speed of the galactic wind and the magnetic field strength,
unless the gas mass is less than currently preferred values. Additionally, our
starburst model consistently underestimates the observed gamma-ray flux and
overestimates the radio flux for NGC 1068; these issues would be resolved if
the AGN is the primary source of gamma-rays. We discuss the implications of

halo image around bright X-ray point sources situated behind a large amount of
interstellar material. We present analytic solutions to the integral for the
dust scattering intensity, which allow for a Bayesian analysis of the
scattering halo around Cygnus X-3. Fitting the optically thin 4-6 keV halo
surface brightness profile yields the dust grain size and spatial distribution.
We assume a power law distribution of grain sizes ($n \propto a^{-p}$) and fit
for $p$, the grain radius cut-off amax, and dust mass column. We find that a $p
\approx 3.5$ dust grain size distribution with amax $\approx 0.2$ um fits the
halo profile relatively well, whether the dust is distributed uniformly along
the line of sight or in clumps. We find that a model consisting of two dust
screens, representative of foreground spiral arms, requires the foreground
Perseus arm to contain 80\% of the total dust mass. The remaining 20\% of the
dust, which may be associated with the outer spiral arm of the Milky Way, is
located within 1 kpc of Cyg X-3. Regardless of which model was used, we found
$\tau_{\rm sca} \sim 2 \ E_{\rm keV}^{-2}$. We examine the energy resolved
halos of Cyg X-3 from 1 - 6 keV and find that there is a sharp drop in
scattering halo intensity when $E < 2-3$ keV, which cannot be explained with
multiple scattering effects. We hypothesize that this may be caused by large
dust grains or material with unique dielectric properties, causing the
scattering cross-section to depart from the Rayleigh-Gans approximation that is
used most often in X-ray scattering studies. The foreground Cyg OB2
association, which contains several evolved stars with large extinction values,
is a likely culprit for grains of unique size or composition.

one mode is observed in each single film. For the TMJ grown on a sapphire

exchange coupling between the two magnetic layers is too small to give rise to
observable shifts. For TMJs grown on a Si or on a MgO substrate the resonance

Our first theorem concerns with the concept of multiple peaks. A theorem of
Chatterjee states that when a centered Gaussian field admits the so-called
superconcentration property, it typically attains values near its maximum on
multiple near-orthogonal sites, known as multiple peaks. We improve his theorem
in two aspects: (i) the number of peaks attained by our bound is of the order
$\exp(c / \sigma^2)$ (as opposed to Chatterjee's polynomial bound in
$1/\sigma$), where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the supremum of the
Gaussian field, which is assumed to have variance at most $1$ and (ii) our
bound need not assume that the correlations are non-negative. We also prove a
similar result based on the superconcentration of the free energy. As primary
applications, we infer that for the S-K spin glass model on the $n$-hypercube
and directed polymers on $\mathbb{Z}_n^2$, there are polynomially (in $n$) many
near-orthogonal sites that achieve values near their respective maxima.
  Our second theorem gives an upper bound on moderate deviation for the
supremum of a general Gaussian field. While the Gaussian isoperimetric
inequality implies a sub-Gaussian concentration bound for the supremum, we show
that the exponent in that bound can be improved under the assumption that the
expectation of the supremum is of the same order as that of the independent
case.

assumes top-hat profiles. Given our formalism, the non-linear halo density can
be calculated once the shape of the initial peak's density profile and the
shape of the virialized halo's profile are provided. We solve for $\Delta_c$
for halos in an Einstein de-Sitter and $\Lambda$CDM universe. As examples, we
consider power-law initial profiles as well as spherically averaged peak
profiles calculated from the statistics of a Gaussian random field.
  We find that, depending on the profiles used, $\Delta_c$ is smaller by a
factor of a few to as much as a factor of 10 as compared to the density given
by the standard calculation ($\approx 200$). Using our results, we show that,
for halo finding algorithms that identify halos through an over-density
threshold, the halo mass function measured from cosmological simulations can be
enhanced at all halo masses by a factor of a few. This difference could be
important when using numerical simulations to assess the validity of analytic

bound for the sum of generalized entropies for any pair of entropic

Deutsch one, but Maassen-Uffink bound prevails when $c_{A,B} \leq\frac12$.
Finally, we illustrate by comparing our bound with known previous results in

furthermore, our estimation makes use of the full observed data. The proposed
method is semiparametric as no parametric forms are assumed on all the marginal
distributions. But we select appropriate bivariate copulas to model the joint
dependence structure by taking the advantage of the recent development in
constructing large dimensional vine copulas. Consequently a sample quantile
resulted from a large bootstrap sample drawn from the fitted joint distribution
is taken as the estimator for the extreme quantile. This estimator is proved to
be consistent. The reliable and robust performance of the proposed method is
further illustrated by simulation.

concepts have been considered in the general case of open quantum systems where
decoherence occurs. Then, what are the properties of weak values for the
unavoidable measurement associated to decoherence, the one performed by the

a quantum bit in presence of a relaxation channel. We continuously monitor the
fluorescence emitted by a superconducting qubit driven at resonance.
Conditioned on initial preparation and final single shot measurement outcome of
the qubit state, we probe weak values displaying all the above properties. The
fluorescence signal exhibits interferences between oscillations associated to

identify AGD names, characterize their DGAs and isolate logical groups of
domains that represent the respective botnets. Moreover, our system enriches
these groups with new, previously unknown AGD names, and produce novel
knowledge about the evolving behavior of each tracked botnet.
  We used our system in real-world settings, to help researchers that requested
intelligence on suspicious domains and were able to label them as belonging to
the correct botnet automatically.
  Additionally, we ran an evaluation on 1,153,516 domains, including AGDs from
both modern (e.g., Bamital) and traditional (e.g., Conficker, Torpig) botnets.
Our approach correctly isolated families of AGDs that belonged to distinct

unitarity and their interrelation play a prominent role. Assuming the 't Hooft
S matrix ansatz for a gravitating region surrounded by an asymptotically flat
space-time we find a non-local transformation which changes the standard
causality requirement but is a symmetry of the unitarity condition of the S
matrix. This new S matrix then implies correlations between the in and out
states of the theory with the involvement of a third entity which in the case
of a quantum black hole, we argue is the horizon S matrix. Such correlations
are thus linked to preserving the unitarity of the S matrix and to the fact
that entangling unitary operators are nonlocal. The analysis is performed
within the Bogoliubov S matrix framework by considering a spacetime consisting
of causal complements with a boundary in between. No particular metric or
lagrangian dynamics need be invoked even to obtain an evolution equation for
the full S matrix. Constraints imposed by the new causality requirement and
implications for the effectiveness of field theoretical descriptions and for
complementarity are also discussed. We find that the tension between
information preservation and complementarity may be resolved provided the full
quantum gravity theory either through symmetries or fine tuning forbids the
occurrence of closed time like curves of information flow. Then, even if
causality is violated near the horizon at any intermediate stage, a standard
causal ordering may be preserved for the observer away from the horizon. In the
context of the black hole, the novelty of our formulation is that it appears
well suited to understand unitarity at any intermediate stage of black hole
evaporation. Moreover, it is applicable generally to all theories with long
range correlations including the final state projection models.

interaction that uses Lagrangian variables to describe the structure and
Eulerian variables to describe the fluid. Explicit time stepping schemes for
the IB method require solvers only for Eulerian equations, for which fast
Cartesian grid solution methods are available. Such methods are relatively
straightforward to develop and are widely used in practice but often require
very small time steps to maintain stability. Implicit-time IB methods permit
the stable use of large time steps, but efficient implementations of such
methods require significantly more complex solvers that effectively treat both
Lagrangian and Eulerian variables simultaneously. Several different approaches
to solving the coupled Lagrangian-Eulerian equations have been proposed, but a
complete understanding of this problem is still emerging. This paper presents a
geometric multigrid method for an implicit-time discretization of the IB
equations. This multigrid scheme uses a generalization of box relaxation that
is shown to handle problems in which the physical stiffness of the structure is
very large. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of the algorithms described herein. These tests show that using
multigrid as a preconditioner for a Krylov method yields improvements in both
robustness and efficiency as compared to using multigrid as a solver. They also
demonstrate that with a time step 100--1000 times larger than that permitted by
an explicit IB method, the multigrid-preconditioned implicit IB method is
approximately 50--200 times more efficient than the explicit method.

a wider range of microscopic parameters, even extremely wide for multiband
superconductors. In this critical range, the degeneracy of the superconducting
state at Tc is lifted into a sequence of novel topological equilibria and the
customary understanding of superconducting phenomena does not suffice. As a
radical departure from traditional views, we introduce the paradigm of critical
superconductors, discuss their distinct magnetic properties, advocate their
subdivision in terms of possible intermediate states, and demonstrate direct
relevance of this paradigm to superconducting materials of prime interest
today.

block fading channel. We assume that the transmitter is unaware of the channel
state information (CSI) but has a knowledge about the channel statistics. We
consider two scenarios with respect to the feedback received by the
transmitter: i) ''conventional'', one-bit feedback about the decoding
success/failure (ACK/NACK), and ii) the multi-bit feedback scheme when, on top
of ACK/NACK, the receiver provides additional information about the state of
the decoder to the transmitter. In both cases, the feedback is used to allocate
(in the case of one-bit feedback) or adapt (in the case of multi-bit feedback)
the power across the HARQ transmission attempts. The objective in both cases is
the minimization of the outage probability under long-term average and peak
power constraints. We cast the problems into the dynamic programming (DP)
framework and solve them for Nakagami-m fading channels. A simplified solution
for the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime is presented using a geometric
programming (GP) approach. The obtained results quantify the advantage of the
multi-bit feedback over the conventional approach, and show that the power
optimization can provide significant gains over conventional power-constant

on a probability distribution on its vertex set. This graph functional
originated from the problem of source coding in information theory and was
introduced by J. K\""{o}rner in 1973. Although the notion of graph entropy has
its roots in information theory, it was proved to be closely related to some
classical and frequently studied graph theoretic concepts. For example, it
provides an equivalent definition for a graph to be perfect and it can also be
applied to obtain lower bounds in graph covering problems.
  In this thesis, we review and investigate three equivalent definitions of
graph entropy and its basic properties. Minimum entropy colouring of a graph
was proposed by N. Alon in 1996. We study minimum entropy colouring and its
relation to graph entropy. We also discuss the relationship between the entropy
and the fractional chromatic number of a graph which was already established in
the literature.
  A graph $G$ is called \emph{symmetric with respect to a functional $F_G(P)$}
defined on the set of all the probability distributions on its vertex set if
the distribution $P^*$ maximizing $F_G(P)$ is uniform on $V(G)$. Using the
combinatorial definition of the entropy of a graph in terms of its vertex
packing polytope and the relationship between the graph entropy and fractional
chromatic number, we prove that vertex transitive graphs are symmetric with
respect to graph entropy. Furthermore, we show that a bipartite graph is
symmetric with respect to graph entropy if and only if it has a perfect
matching. As a generalization of this result, we characterize some classes of
symmetric perfect graphs with respect to graph entropy. Finally, we prove that
the line graph of every bridgeless cubic graph is symmetric with respect to
graph entropy.

cross spectrum and wavelet cross coherence of ECG patterns. Most of the ECG
analysing systems use explicit time plane features for cardiac pattern
classification. Application of this proposed technique for classification
eliminates the need for extraction of various explicit time plane features and
hence reduces the complexity of the system. The cross-correlation is the
measure of similarity between two waveforms or two time series and the cross
examination reveals localized similarities in time and scale. Parameters
extracted from Wavelet Cross Spectrum (WCS) and Wavelet Coherence (WCOH) is
used for classification. A pathologically varying pattern in QT zone of
inferior lead III shows the presence of Inferior Myocardial Infarction (IMI).
The Cross Wavelet Transform and Wavelet Coherence is used for the cross
examination of single normal and abnormal (IMI) beats. A normal template beat
is selected as the absolute normal pattern. Computation of the WCS and WCOH of
the selected normal template and various other normal and abnormal beats
reveals the existence of variation among patterns under study. The Wavelet
cross spectrum and Wavelet coherence of various ECG patterns shows
distinguishing characteristics over two specific regions R1 and R2, where R1 is
the QRS complex location and R2 is the T wave region. Parameters are identified
for classification of Type 1 IMI (non Q type, with ST elevation and attenuated
QRS complex) and Type 2 IMI (Q type MI with deep Q and inverted T) and normal

constant during this period, the spectroastrometric signal of the v=1--0 lines
varies substantially. At all epochs, the spectroastrometric signals of the UV

clusters by building an exact general relativistic model of a cluster using the
inhomogeneous and anisotropic Szekeres metric. The model is built from a
modified Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profile. We compare this to a
corresponding spherically symmetric structure in the Lemaitre-Tolman (LT) model
and quantify the impact of introducing varying levels of anisotropy. We examine
two physical measures of gravitational infall -- the growth rate of density and
the velocity of the source dust in the model. We introduce a generalization of
the LT dust velocity profile for the Szekeres metric and demonstrate its
consistency with the growth rate of density. We find that the growth rate of
density in one substructure increases by 0.5%, 1.5%, and 3.75% for 5%, 10%, and
15% levels of introduced anisotropy, which is measured as the fractional
displaced mass relative to the spherically symmetric case. The infall velocity
of the dust is found to increase by 2.5, 10, and 20 km/s (0.5%, 2%, and 4.5%),
respectively, for the same three levels of anisotropy. This response to the
anisotropy in a structure is found to be strongly nonlinear with respect to the
strength of anisotropy. These relative velocities correspond to an equivalent
increase in the total mass of the spherically symmetric structure of 1%, 3.8%,
and 8.4%, indicating that not accounting for the presence of anisotropic mass
distributions in cluster models can strongly bias the determination of physical
properties like the total mass.

Further, European mice carry more M. spretus alleles than the sympatric African

distinct hybridization events involving M. spretus have occurred, one of which

rodenticide selection). Second, several of the inferred introgressed tracts
contain genes that are likely to confer adaptive advantage. Third, introgressed
tracts might contain driver genes that determine the evolutionary fate of those

essential to fitness, including the Vkorc1 gene, which is implicated in

predictions at BAO scales. We control the effect of numerical systematic errors
using a series of large volume high-resolution simulations. The combined

to 1% over the entire BAO range, $0.03<k [\textrm{h Mpc}^{-1}]<0.3$, in bins of
size $\Delta k/k\lesssim$ 1%. We define the BAO with respect to a non-linearly
evolved wiggle-free spectrum and determine the characteristics of the BAO
without recurring to extrapolation from global fitting functions. We quantify
the effects of non-linearities on the position and amplitude of the BAO
extrema, and the coupling to the broadband slope of the power spectrum. We use
these estimates to test non-linear predictions from semi-analytical models.
Quite remarkably from the analysis of the redshift evolution of BAO we find
that the second dip and third peak remains unaltered by non-linear effects.
Furthermore, we find that the square of the damping factor and the shift of the
position of BAO extrema scale to good approximation as the square of the growth
factor, in agreement with expectations from perturbation theory. This confirms
the idea that, besides cosmic distances, an accurate measurement of BAO at
different redshifts can directly probe the growth of cosmic structures.

besides the Hall effect, the transmission of electrons within a waveguide (WG)

work, we investigated the conductance properties in the HM/SL-film-embedded

to the original spin field contour. When an electron transports in the WG, the
topological magnetic field generalized by the HM/SL spin texture exerts on it

different quantum paths the electron experiences, the HM/SL spin texture is
recorded in the conductance. The scheme also provides a possible detect of the

thermal Comptonization in a warm plasma, describe the soft-excess equally well

similar fits to the broad-band UV (Optical Monitor) and X-ray data. XMM-Newton
observations performed in 2000, 2001 and 2006 on this source show flux
variability. From 2001 to 2006, the UV flux increased by $\sim23\%$ while the
$2-10\kev$ X-ray flux as well as the soft-excess flux decreased by ~ 20. This
observation can be described in the blurred reflection scenario by a truncated
accretion disk whose inner-most radius had come closer to the blackhole. We
find that the best-fit inner radius of the accretion disk decreases from
R_{in}=4.93_{-1.10}^{+1.12}R_G to R_{in}<2.5R_G from 2001 to 2006. This leads
to an increase in the UV flux and compressing the corona, leading to reduction
of the powerlaw flux and therefore the soft-excess. The blurred reflection

total electron density together with the density of current-carrying electrons
are sufficient to determine the properties of the system. Two mean fields, one
for current-carrying electrons and the other one for equilibrium electrons can
then be derived.By generalizing the Thomas-Fermi-Dirac (TFD) model to
non-equilibrium cases, we analytically derived the DMF exchange energy density
functional. We implemented the DMF approach into the computational package
SIESTA to study non-equilibrium electron transport through molecular junctions.
Calculations for a graphene nanoribbon (GNR) junction show that compared with
the commonly used \textit{ab initio} transport theory, the DMF approach could
significantly reduce the electric current at low biases due to the
non-equilibrium corrections to the mean field potential in the scattering
region.

from the existing studies where PU is assumed to have only one constant
transmit power, the new consideration well matches the practical standards,
i.e., IEEE 802.11 Series, GSM, LTE, LTE-A, etc., as well as the adaptive power
concept that has been studied over the past decades. The primary target in this
new CR scenario is, of course, still to detect the presence of PU. However,
there appears a secondary target as to identify the PU's transmit power level.
Compared to the existing works where the secondary user (SU) only senses the
``on-off'' status of PU, recognizing the power level of PU achieves more
``cognition"", and could be utilized to protect different powered PU with
different interference levels. We derived quite many closed-form results for
either the threshold expressions or the performance analysis, from which many
interesting points and discussions are raised. We then further study the
cooperative sensing strategy in this new cognitive scenario and show its
significant difference from traditional algorithms. Numerical examples are

fit individual eclipses, in addition to fitting binned light curves, to learn
more about the process underlying the eclipse depth variation. Additionally, we
put forward observational constraints that any model of this planet-star system
will have to match. We find two quiescent spells of ~30 orbital periods each
where the transit depth is <0.1%, followed by relatively deep transits.
Additionally, we find periods of on-off behaviour where >0.5% deep transits are
followed by apparently no transit at all. Apart from these isolated events we
find neither significant correlation between consecutive transit depths nor a
correlation between transit depth and stellar intensity. We find a three-sigma
upper limit for the secondary eclipse of 4.9*10^-5, consistent with a planet
candidate with a radius of less than 4600 km. Using the short cadence data we
find that a 1-D exponential dust tail model is insufficient to explain the
data. We improved our model to a 2-D, two-component dust model with an opaque
core and an exponential tail. Using this model we fit individual eclipses
observed in short cadence mode. We find an improved fit of the data,
quantifying earlier suggestions by Budaj (2013) of the necessity of at least
two components. We find that deep transits have most absorption in the tail,

Superlensing using complementary media was suggested by Veselago in [16] and
innovated by Nicorovici et al. in [9] and Pendry in [10]. The study of this
problem is difficult due to two facts. Firstly, this problem is unstable since
the equations describing the phenomena have sign changing coefficients; hence
the ellipticity is lost. Secondly, the phenomena associated are localized
resonant, i.e., the field explodes in some regions and remains bounded in some
others. This makes the problem difficult to analyse. In this paper, we develop
the technique of removing of localized singularity introduced in [6] and make
use of the reflecting technique in [5] to overcome these two difficulties. More
precisely, we suggest a class of lenses which has root from [9] and [14] and
inspired from [6] and give a proof of superlensing for this class. To our
knowledge, this is the first rigorous proof on the magnification of an
arbitrary inhomogeneous object using complementary media.

aspects of quantum states and play some role as resources in quantum
information processing. In this work, we look for the hierarchy satisfied by
these quantum correlation witnesses for a class of two-qubit states. We show
that $N \triangleright S\triangleright E\triangleright D_q$, meaning that
nonlocality implies steering, which in turn implies entanglement, which then
implies $q$-discord. For the quantum states under concern, we show that the
invariance of this hierarchy under noisy quantum channels directly implies a
death chronology. Additionally, we have found that sudden death of all quantum
resources except discord is absent only for a subset of states of measure zero.
At last, we provide an illustration of another consequence of the
aforementioned hierarchy, namely, the existence of a sudden birth chronology
under non-Markovian channels.

good description. We also use the parton distribution reweighting procedure to
estimate the impact of these new data on the PDFs, finding that the combined
ATLAS 2.76 TeV and 7 TeV data, and CMS 7 TeV data have some significant impact.
We then also investigate the impact of ATLAS, CMS and D0 dijet data using the
same techniques. In this case we investigate the effect of using different
scale choices for the NLO cross section calculation. We find that the dijet
data is generally not completely compatible with the corresponding inclusive
jet data, often tending to pull PDFs, particularly the gluon distribution, away
from the default values. However, the effect depends on the dijet data set used
as well as the scale choice. We also note that conclusions may be affected by
limiting the pull on the data luminosity chosen by the best fit, which is
sometimes a number of standard deviations. Finally we include the inclusive jet
data in a new PDF fit explicitly. This enables us to check the consistency of
the exact result with that obtained from the reweighting procedure. There is
generally good, but not full quantitative agreement. Hence, the conclusion
remains that MSTW2008 PDFs already fit the published jet data well, but the
central values and uncertainties are altered and improved respectively by
significant, but not dramatic extent by inclusion of these data.

$\gamma$-ray sources. The subset of blazars known as BL Lac objects is on
average closer to Earth and characterized by harder spectra at high energy than
the whole sample. The fraction of BL Lacs that is too dim to be detected and
resolved by current $\gamma$-ray telescopes is therefore expected to contribute
to the high-energy isotropic diffuse $\gamma$-ray background (IGRB). The IGRB
has been recently measured over a wide energy range by the Large Area Telescope
(LAT) on board the Gamma-ray Space Telescope ({\it Fermi}). We present a new
prediction of the diffuse $\gamma$-ray flux due to the unresolved BL Lac blazar
population. The model is built upon the spectral energy distribution and the
luminosity function derived from the fraction of BL Lacs detected (and
spectrally characterized) in the $\gamma$-ray energy range. We focus our
attention on the ${\cal O}(100)$ GeV energy range, predicting the emission up
to the TeV scale and taking into account the absorption on the extragalactic
background light. In order to better shape the BL Lac spectral energy
distribution, we combine the {\it Fermi}-LAT data with Imaging Atmospheric
Cerenkov Telescopes measurements of the most energetic sources. Our analysis is
carried on separately for low- and intermediate-synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs on
one hand, and high-synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs on the other one: we find in fact
statistically different features for the two. The diffuse emission from the sum
of both BL Lac classes increases from about 10$\%$ of the measured IGRB at 100

scales is extensively investigated together with new radio images taken by EVN
observations. We detected proper motions of components located at between 160
mas from the core and the HST-1 complex for the first time. Newly derived
velocity fields exhibits a systematic increase from sub-to-superluminal speed
in the upstream of HST-1. If we assume that the observed velocities reflect the
bulk flow, we here suggest that the M87 jet may be gradually accelerated
through a distance of 10^6 times of the Schwarzschild radius of the
supermassive black hole. The acceleration zone is co-spatial with the jet
parabolic region, which is interpreted as the collimation zone of the jet
(Asada & Nakamura 2012). The acceleration and collimation take place
simultaneously, which we suggest a characteristic of magnetohydrodynamic flows.
Distribution of the velocity field has a peak at HST-1, which is considered as
the site of over-collimation, and shows a deceleration downstream of HST-1
where the jet is conical. Our interpretation of the velocity map in the M87 jet
gives a hypothesis in AGNs that the acceleration and collimation zone of
relativistic jets extends over the whole scale within the sphere of influence
of the supermassive black hole.

analysis of high dimensional stochastic systems and in particular for lattice
Kinetic Monte Carlo. Sensitivity analysis for stochastic systems is typically
based on approximating continuous derivatives with respect to model parameters
by the mean value of samples from a finite difference scheme. Instead of using
independent samples the proposed algorithm reduces the variance of the
estimator by developing a strongly correlated-""coupled""- stochastic process for
both the perturbed and unperturbed stochastic processes, defined in a common
state space. The novelty of our construction is that the new coupled process
depends on the targeted observables, e.g. coverage, Hamiltonian, spatial
correlations, surface roughness, etc., hence we refer to the proposed method as
em goal-oriented sensitivity analysis. In particular, the rates of the coupled
Continuous Time Markov Chain are obtained as solutions to a goal-oriented
optimization problem, depending on the observable of interest, by considering
the minimization functional of the corresponding variance. We show that this
functional can be used as a diagnostic tool for the design and evaluation of
different classes of couplings. Furthermore the resulting KMC sensitivity
algorithm has an easy implementation that is based on the Bortz-Kalos-Lebowitz
algorithm's philosophy, where here events are divided in classes depending on
level sets of the observable of interest. Finally, we demonstrate in several
examples including adsorption, desorption and diffusion Kinetic Monte Carlo
that for the same confidence interval and observable, the proposed
goal-oriented algorithm can be two orders of magnitude faster than existing
coupling algorithms for spatial KMC such as the Common Random Number approach.

linear polarization of the ground-state related transitions for asymmetric QDs
of a material with small split-off energy. It is demonstrated that a moderate

and to control its direction. InN is found to be the most efficient choice for
dynamic polarization switching controlled by an electric field, with potential
for polarization control on a photon-by-photon level.

the beginning of the cosmological era in 1997. We report on the final IPN
localization of this event and its detailed multiwavelength study with a number
of space-based instruments. The prompt emission is characterized by a typical
duration, a moderare $E_{peak}$ of the time-integrated spectrum, and strong
hard-to-soft evolution. The high observed energy fluence yields, at z=0.984, a
huge isotropic-equivalent energy release $E_{iso}=(2.1\pm0.1)\times10^{54}$
erg. The record-breaking energy flux observed at the peak of the short, bright,
hard initial pulse results in an unprecedented isotropic-equivalent luminosity
$L_{iso}=(4.7\pm0.2)\times10^{54}$erg s$^{-1}$. A tail of the soft gamma-ray
emission was detected with temporal and spectral behavior typical of that
predicted by the synchrotron forward-shock model. Swift/XRT and Swift/UVOT
observed the bright afterglow from 1.2 to 48 days after the burst and revealed
no evidence of a jet break. The post-break scenario for the afterglow is
preferred from our analysis, with a hard underlying electron spectrum and
ISM-like circumburst environment implied. We conclude that, among multiple
reasons investigated, the tight collimation of the jet must have been a key
ingredient to produce this unusually bright burst. The inferred jet opening
angle of 1.7-3.4 deg results in reasonable values of the collimation-corrected
radiated energy and the peak luminosity, which, however, are still at the top
of their distributions for such tightly collimated events. We estimate a
detection horizon for a similar ultraluminous GRB of $z\sim7.5$ for Konus-WIND,

the early Universe.

susceptible to false alarms from instrumental artifacts, for example
monochromatic sinusoidal disturbances ('lines'). This vulnerability to line
artifacts arises because the F-statistic compares the signal hypothesis to a
Gaussian-noise hypothesis, and hence is triggered by anything that resembles
the signal hypothesis more than Gaussian noise. Various ad-hoc veto methods to
deal with such line artifacts have been proposed and used in the past. Here we
develop a Bayesian framework that includes an explicit alternative hypothesis
to model disturbed data. We introduce a simple line model that defines lines as
signal candidates appearing only in one detector. This allows us to explicitly
compute the odds between the signal hypothesis and an extended noise
hypothesis, resulting in a new detection statistic that is more robust to
instrumental artifacts. We present and discuss results from Monte-Carlo tests
on both simulated data and on detector data from the fifth LIGO science run. We
find that the line-robust statistic retains the detection power of the standard
F-statistic in Gaussian noise. In the presence of line artifacts it is more
sensitive, even compared to the popular F-statistic consistency veto, over
which it improves by as much as a factor of two in detectable signal strength.

dominant alpha-frequency, which is also observed in the normal state, both the

been known since 1998, so far there has been no way of using it with dipole

was accessed for information on each paper including the number of citations.
For each paper, the XMM-Newton observation identifiers and instruments were
determined and used extract detailed information from the XMM-Newton archive on
the parameters of the observations. The information obtained from these sources
was then combined to allow the scientific productivity of the mission to be
assessed. Since three years after the launch, about 300 refereed papers per
year were published that directly use XMM-Newton data. After more than 13 years
in operation, this rate shows no decline. Since 2002, around 100 scientists per
year have become lead authors for the first time. Each refereed XMM-Newton
paper receives around four citations per year in the first few years with a
long-term citation rate of three citations per year, more than five years after
publication. About half of the articles citing XMM-Newton articles are not
primarily X-ray observational papers. The distribution of elapsed time between
observations taken under the Guest Observer programme and first article peaks
at 2 years with a possible second peak at 3.25 years. Observations taken under
the Target of Opportunity programme are published significantly faster, after
one year on average. 90% of science time taken until the end of 2009 has been
used in at least one article. Most observations were used more than once,
yielding on average a factor of two in usage on available observing time per
year. About 20% of all slew observations have been used in publications. The
scientific productivity of XMM-Newton remains extremely high with no evidence
that it is decreasing after more than 13 years of operations.

happens over a very short range of the adiabatic path. By focussing on that
restricted range, one can potentially gain advantage by reducing the control
requirements on the system, enabling a uniform rate of evolution. In this
comment, we point out an oversight in the original work [1] that invalidates
its proof. However, the argument can be corrected, and the calculations in [1]

subsequent works [2-6] cannot all be recovered in the same way.

sources, making them candidate clusters of dusty, starforming galaxies. We use
complementary optical and NIR data for these clumps to test this idea, and find
evidence for the presence of galaxy clusters in all four cases. We use
photometric redshifts and red sequence galaxies to estimate the redshifts of
these clusters, finding that they range from 0.8 to 2.3. These redshifts imply
that the Herschel sources in these clusters, which contribute to the detected
Planck flux, are forming stars very rapidly, with typical total cluster star
formation rates greater than 1000Msun per yr. The high redshift clusters
discovered in these observations are used to constrain the epoch of cluster
galaxy formation, finding that the galaxies in our clusters are 1 to 1.5 Gy old

quantum mechanics (e.g. Gottesman and Chuang 2001). Here, security against
forging relies on the impossibility of perfectly distinguishing between
non-orthogonal quantum states. A serious drawback of previous QDS schemes is
however that they require long-term quantum memory, making them unfeasible in
practice. We present the first realisation of a scheme (Dunjko et al 2013) that
does not need quantum memory, and which also uses only standard linear optical
components and photodetectors. To achieve this, the recipients measure the
distributed quantum signature states using a new type of quantum measurement,
quantum state elimination (e.g. Barnett 2009, Bandyopadhyay et al 2013). This
significantly advances QDS as a quantum technology with potential for real

that regulate the growth of massive galaxies at high redshifts. In this paper
we aim to: (1) confirm spectroscopically the redshifts of a sample of massive
galaxies selected with photometric redshifts z > 2.5; (2) investigate the
properties of their stellar and interstellar media; (3) detect the presence of
outflows, and measure their velocities. To achieve this, we analysed deep,
high-resolution (R~2000) FORS2 rest-frame UV spectra for 11 targets. We
confirmed that 9 out of 11 have spectroscopic redshifts z > 2.5. We also
serendipitously found two mask fillers at redshift z > 2.5, which originally
were assigned photometric redshifts 2.0 < z < 2.5. In the four highest-quality
spectra we derived outflow velocities by fitting the absorption line profiles
with models including multiple dynamical components. We found strongly
asymmetric, high-ionisation lines, from which we derived outflow velocities
ranging from 480 to 1518 km/s. The two galaxies with highest velocity show
signs of AGN. We revised the spectral energy distribution fitting U-band
through 8 micron photometry, including the analysis of a power-law component
subtraction to identify the possible presence of active galactic nuclei (AGN).
The revised stellar masses of all but one of our targets are >1e10 Msun, with
four having stellar masses > 5e10 Msun. Three galaxies have a significant
power-law component in their spectral energy distributions, which indicates
that they host AGN. We conclude that massive galaxies are characterised by
significantly higher velocity outflows than the typical Lyman break galaxies at
z ~ 3. The incidence of high-velocity outflows (~40% within our sample) is also
much higher than among massive galaxies at z < 1, which is consistent with the
powerful star formation and nuclear activity that most massive galaxies display
at z > 2.

frequency maps we produced maps of the optical depth as a function of
frequency. The morphology of the optical-depth maps of J1324+4048 is strikingly
smooth, suggestive of a foreground screen of absorbing gas. The spectra at the
intensity peaks fit a simple free-free absorption model, with a reduced chi
square ~ 2, better than a simple synchrotron self-absorption model, in which
the reduced chi square ~ 3.5 - 5.5. We conclude that the case for free-free
absorption in J1324+4048 is strong. The optical-depth maps of J0029+3457
exhibit structure, but the morphology does not correlate with that in the
intensity maps. The fit of the spectra at the peaks to a simple free-free
absorption model yields a reduced chi square ~ 1, but since the turnover is
gradual the fit is relatively insensitive to the input parameters. We find that
free-free absorption by a thin amount of gas in J0029+3457 is likely, but not
definitive. One compact feature in J0029+3457 has an inverted spectrum even at
the highest frequencies. We infer this to be the location of the core and
estimate an upper limit to the magnetic field of order 3 Gauss at a radius of
order 1 pc. In comparison with maps from observations at earlier epochs, no
apparent growth in either J1324+4048 or J0029+3457 is apparent, with upper
limits of 0.03 and 0.02 mas per yr, corresponding to maximum linear separation

interaction of nuclei with WIMP dark matter or from the scattering of new
species of MeV-energy neutrinos. The most promising model for the latter case
is a neutrino $\nu_b$ that interacts with baryon number, and with a flux
sourced by the oscillations of regular solar $^8$B neutrinos. We re-analyze
this model in light of the latest experimental results. In contrast to the
light-DM interpretation of various tentative positive signals (anomalies) that
is now seriously challenged by the negative results of the LUX experiment, the
neutrino interpretation remains a viable explanation to most of the anomalies.
Considering future prospects, we show that the superCDMS experiment alone, when
equipped with Ge and Si detectors, will be able to detect $\nu_b$ and
discriminate the model from a light DM interpretation. In addition, we also
provide the forecast for the new CRESST-II run that now operates with new

signal processing problems has received considerable attention recently.
Sparsity constraints refer to the a priori information that the object or
signal of interest can be represented by using only few elements of a
predefined dictionary. Within this thesis, sparsity refers to the fact that a
vector to be estimated has only few nonzero entries. One specific field
concerned with sparsity constraints has become popular under the name
Compressed Sensing (CS). Within CS, the sparsity is exploited in order to
perform (nearly) lossless compression. Moreover, this compression is carried
out jointly or simultaneously with the process of sensing a physical quantity.
In contrast to CS, one can alternatively use sparsity to enhance signal
processing methods. Obviously, sparsity constraints can only improve the
obtainable estimation performance since the constraints can be interpreted as
an additional prior information about the unknown parameter vector which is to
be estimated. Our main focus will be on this aspect of sparsity, i.e., we
analyze how much we can gain in estimation performance due to the sparsity
constraints.

microscopy and next generation DNA sequencing are providing new ways to
quantify the distribution of clones of normal and mutated cells.
Population-wide clone size distributions in vivo are complicated by multiple
cell types, and overlapping birth and death processes. This has led to the
increased need for mathematically informed models to understand their
biological significance. Standard approaches usually require knowledge of
clonal age. We show that modelling on clone size independent of time is an
alternative method that offers certain analytical advantages; it can help
parameterize these models, and obtain distributions for counts of mutated or
proliferating cells, for example. When applied to a general birth-death process
common in epithelial progenitors this takes the form of a gamblers ruin
problem, the solution of which relates to counting Motzkin lattice paths.
Applying this approach to mutational processes, an alternative, exact,
formulation of the classic Luria Delbruck problem emerges. This approach can be
extended beyond neutral models of mutant clonal evolution, and also describe
some distributions relating to sub-clones within a tumour. The approaches above
are generally applicable to any Markovian branching process where the dynamics
of different ""coloured"" daughter branches are of interest.

on all these scales and probably to the highest energies. DSA is simple, robust

analogy (SQHA) is used to obtain the far from equilibrium kinetics for a real

Lennard-Jones potentials whose mean distance is bigger than the quantum
correlation distance and than the molecular interaction distance r0, it is
possible to define a Fokker-Plank type equation of motion as a function of the
mean phase space molecular volume that far from equilibrium shows maximizing
the dissipation of a part of the generalized SQHA-free energy. In the case of a
real gas with no chemical reactions and at quasi-isothermal conditions, the

experimental outputs of electro-convective instability. In this case, the model
shows that the transition to stationary states with higher free energy can
happen and that, in incompressible fluids, the increase of free energy is
almost given by a decrease of entropy leading to the appearance of self-ordered
structures. The output of the theory showing that the generation of order, via
energy dissipation, is more efficient in fluids than in gasses, because of
their incompressibility, leads to the re-conciliation between physics and
biology furnishing the eplanation why the life was born in water. The
theoretical output also suggests that the search for life out of the earth must
consider the possibility to find it in presence of liquid phases different from
water.

Einstein manifolds mimic physical effects in modified gravity theories (MGTs)
and encode certain models of the $f(R,T,...)$, Ho\v{r}ava type with dynamical
Lorentz symmetry breaking, induced effective mass for the graviton etc. Our
main goal is to investigate the dynamical breaking of local supersymmetry
determined by off-diagonal solutions in MGTs and encoded as effective Einstein
spaces. This includes the Deser-Zumino super-Higgs effect, for instance, for a
one-loop potential in a (simple but representative) model of $\mathcal{N}=1,
D=4$ supergravity. We develop and apply new geometrical techniques which allows
us to decouple the gravitational field equations and integrate them in a very
general form with the metric and vielbein fields depending on all the spacetime
coordinates via means of various generating and integration functions and
parameters. We study how solutions in MGTs may be related to the dynamical
generation of a gravitino mass and supersymmetry breaking.

and $X$ a smooth projective scheme over the Witt ring $W(k)$ which is
geometrically connected in characteristic zero. We introduce the notion of
Higgs-de Rham flow and prove that the category of periodic Higgs-de Rham flows
over $X/W(k)$ is equivalent to the category of Fontaine modules, hence further
equivalent to the category of crystalline representations of the \'{e}tale
fundamental group $\pi_1(X_K)$ of the generic fiber of $X$, after
Fontaine-Laffaille and Faltings. Moreover, we prove that every semistable Higgs
bundle over the special fiber $X_k$ of $X$ of rank $\leq p$ initiates a
semistable Higgs-de Rham flow and thus those of rank $\leq p-1$ with trivial
Chern classes induce $k$-representations of $\pi_1(X_K)$. A fundamental
construction in this paper is the inverse Cartier transform over a truncated
Witt ring. In characteristic $p$, it was constructed by Ogus-Vologodsky in the
nonabelian Hodge theory in positive characteristic; in the affine local case,
our construction is related to the local Ogus-Vologodsky correspondence of
Shiho.

was established that there exist no three positive integers which are
consecutive terms of an arithmetic progression; and whose sum of squares is a
perfect or integer square. In that paper, we made use of the 3-parameter
formulas which describe the entire set of positive integer solutions of the
4-variable equation, $x^2+y^2+z^2= t^2$ (See reference [1]) In this work, we
offer an alternative proof to the above result; a proof that uses only powers
of 3 divisibility arguments. This is done in Theorem1, Section2. After that, in
Proposition3(Section4) we use the Quadratic Reciprocity Law for odd primes, to
establish that if p is a prime congruent to 5 or 7 modulo12; then 3 is
quadratic non-residue of p. This then, plays a key role in proving Theorem 2,
which postulates that if p is an odd prime congruent to 5 or 2 mod12; then, the
sum of the squares any p natural numbers which are consecutive terms of an
arithmetic progression; is a non-perfect square. Theorem3 is an immediate
corollary of Theorem2 : for primes p congruent to 5 or 7 mod12; the sum of the
squares of p natural numbers, consecutive terms of an arithmetic progression;
cannot be a perfect square.

phenomena are described well by quantum mechanics and cases such as Lamb Shift
that are not described by quantum mechanics, are described by quantum
electrodynamics. Of course, at the nuclear level, because of some
complications, it is not clear that we can claim the same confidence. One way
of taking these complications and corrections into account seems to be a
modification of the standard quantum theory. In this paper and its follow ups
we consider a straightforward way of extending quantum theory. Our method is
based on a Bohmian approach. We show that this approach has the essential
ability for extending quantum theory, and we do this by introducing
""non-Bohmian"" forms for the quantum potential.

variety of latest electrical engineering areas. However, restricted to the
rather limited conductive inks and printing strategies, the currently existing
electronics manufacturing tools are generally complicated, expensive, time,
material, water and energy consuming, and thus mainly restricted to the
industrial use. Here from an alternative way, the present article demonstrated
for the first time an entirely automatic printing system for personal
electronics manufacturing through introducing a composite liquid metal ink
delivery and printing mechanism to overcome the large surface tension facing
the solution, and integrating it with the notebook computer controlling
algorithm. With the developed printer, any desired electronically conductive
patterns spanning from single wires to various complex structures like
integrated circuit (IC), antenna, PCB, RFID, electronic greeting cards,
decoration arts, classical buildings (White House, Great Wall etc.) or more
do-it-yourself (DIY) circuits were demonstrated to be printed out in a moment
with high precision. And the total cost for the whole system has reached
personal affordability, which is hard to offer by so far the state of the art
technologies. Some fundamental fluid dynamics mechanisms related to the
proposed tapping mode enabled reliable printing and adhesion of the liquid
metal electronics on the flexible substrate was systematically disclosed
through theoretical interpretation and experimental measurements. This clearly
beyond-the-lab technology and pervasively available liquid metal printer opens
the way for large scale home level electronics making in the coming time.

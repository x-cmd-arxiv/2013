because they are free of emissions of toxic and greenhouse gases to the
environment. However, few have questioned the sustainability of the electric
power required to drive these vehicles. This paper presents an in-depth study
that indicates that massive infusion of EVs to our society in a short time span
will likely create a colossal demand for additional electric power generation
much beyond what the US electric power generating industry can provide with its
current generating capacity. Additionally, such demand would result in much
adverse environmental consequences if the current technology of electric power
generation by predominant fossil fuels continues. Other rarely accounted facts
on environmental impacts by EVs are the substantial electric energy required to
produce batteries that drive EVs, and the negative consequences relating to the
recycling of spent batteries.

wireless communications against eavesdropping between legitimate users, when
the main link spanning from source to destination has better propagation
conditions than the wiretap link from source to eavesdropper. In this paper, we
identify and analyze the tradeoffs between the security and reliability of
wireless communications in the presence of eavesdropping attacks. Typically,
the reliability of the main link can be improved by increasing the source's
transmit power (or decreasing its date rate) to reduce the outage probability,
which unfortunately increases the risk that an eavesdropper succeeds in
intercepting the source message through the wiretap link, since the outage
probability of the wiretap link also decreases when a higher transmit power (or
lower date rate) is used. We characterize the security-reliability tradeoffs
(SRT) of conventional direct transmission from source to destination in the
presence of an eavesdropper, where the security and reliability are quantified
in terms of the intercept probability by an eavesdropper and the outage
probability experienced at the destination, respectively. In order to improve
the SRT, we then propose opportunistic relay selection (ORS) and quantify the
attainable SRT improvement upon increasing the number of relays. It is shown
that given the maximum tolerable intercept probability, the outage probability
of our ORS scheme approaches zero for $N \to \infty$, where $N$ is the number
of relays. Conversely, given the maximum tolerable outage probability, the
intercept probability of our ORS scheme tends to zero for $N \to \infty$.

the size and magnetization of the particles and their nuclear magnetic
resonance relaxation properties, which condition their efficiency. Experimental
relaxation results with maghemite particles exhibiting a wide range of sizes
and magnetizations are compared to previously published data and to
well-established relaxation theories with a good agreement. This allows
deriving the experimental master curve of the transverse relaxivity versus
particle size and to predict the MRI contrast efficiency of any type of

of the particles impermeable to water protons and the saturation magnetization
of the corresponding volume. To predict the T2 relaxation efficiency of

performed for different cases: maghemite single crystals and dense clusters,

sinusoids are not spaced equally, the analysis can still highly likely be
applied if we insert pseudo channels in between the real channels so that all

{\em regret} of a client, which is a measure of the waiting time of a client
relative to its shortest-path distance from the depot. Formally, we consider
both the additive and multiplicative versions of, what we call, the {\em
regret-bounded vehicle routing problem} (RVRP). In these problems, we are given
an undirected complete graph $G=(\{r\}\cup V,E)$ on $n$ nodes with a
distinguished root (depot) node $r$, edge costs $\{c_{uv}\}$ that form a
metric, and a regret bound $R$. Given a path $P$ rooted at $r$ and a node $v\in
P$, let $c_P(v)$ be the distance from $r$ to $v$ along $P$. The goal is to find
the fewest number of paths rooted at $r$ that cover all the nodes so that for
every node $v$ covered by (say) path $P$: (i) its additive regret
$c_P(v)-c_{rv}$, with respect to $P$ is at most $R$ in {\em additive-RVRP}; or
(ii) its multiplicative regret, $c_P(c)/c_{rv}$, with respect to $P$ is at most
$R$ in {\em multiplicative-RVRP}.
  Our main result is the {\em first} constant-factor approximation algorithm
for additive-RVRP by devising rounding techniques for a natural {\em
configuration-style LP}. This is a substantial improvement over the
previous-best $O(\log n)$-approximation. Additive-RVRP turns out be a rather
central vehicle-routing problem, whose study reveals insights into a variety of
other regret-related problems as well as the classical {\em
distance-constrained VRP} ({DVRP}). We obtain approximation ratios of
$O\bigl(\log(\frac{R}{R-1})\bigr)$ for multiplicative-RVRP, and
$O\bigl(\min\bigl\{\mathit{OPT},\frac{\log D}{\log\log D}\bigr\}\bigr)$ for
DVRP with distance bound $D$ via reductions to additive-RVRP; the latter
improves upon the previous-best approximation for DVRP.

effectively reducing the use of such expansions to an algorithmic form. It gave
systematic procedures for the development of both near-zone and far-zone
asymptotic expansions, avoiding the divergent integrals which often bedevilled
such methods, and showed that these two expansions could be made to match
exactly, a result described there as somewhat remarkable.
  This paper revisits that work and shows that there is unfortunately an error
in it which invalidates the results of the matching process as given therein.
The present paper identifies that error and shows how it may be corrected to
give valid matching results. The correction is presented in a redevelopment
somewhat different from that of their paper. This shows that far from being
somewhat remarkable, it is in fact inevitable that the match is exact. It is
indeed remarkable that they could carry both expansions to the point at which
matching becomes possible, but if it can be done at all, then the match is
necessarily exact.
  A companion paper will apply this asymptotic matching to a model problem in
which the correct near-zone expansion was obtained by approximation from an
exact solution. It will be shown that there is a discrepancy between this
expansion and results from the original development of Poujade & Blanchet but
that the corrected development presented here reproduces the result of the

universe can be consistently explained by the simple idea of dark matter. The
nature of dark matter is however still unknown. Empirically it cannot be any of
the known particles, and many theories postulate it as a new elementary
particle. Searches for dark matter particles are under way: production at
high-energy accelerators, direct detection through dark matter-nucleus
scattering, indirect detection through cosmic rays, gamma rays, or effects on
stars. Particle dark matter searches rely on observing an excess of events
above background, and a lot of controversies have arisen over the origin of
observed excesses. With the new high-quality cosmic ray measurements from the
AMS-02 experiment, the major uncertainty in modeling cosmic ray fluxes is in
the nuclear physics cross sections for spallation and fragmentation of cosmic
rays off interstellar hydrogen and helium. The understanding of direct
detection backgrounds is limited by poor knowledge of cosmic ray activation in
detector materials, with order of magnitude differences between simulation
codes. A scarcity of data on nucleon spin densities blurs the connection
between dark matter theory and experiments. What is needed, ideally, are more
and better measurements of spallation cross sections relevant to cosmic rays
and cosmogenic activation, and data on the nucleon spin densities in nuclei.

Compressed Sensing (CS) theory offers an appealing framework to address this
issue since it provides theoretical guarantees on the reconstruction of sparse
signals by projection on a low dimensional linear subspace. In this paper, we
focus on a setting where the imaging device allows to sense a fixed set of
measurements. We first discuss the choice of an optimal sampling subspace
(smallest subset) allowing perfect reconstruction of sparse signals. Its
standard design relies on the random drawing of independent measurements. We
discuss how to select the drawing distribution and show that a mixed strategy
involving partial deterministic sampling and independent drawings can help
breaking the so-called ""coherence barrier"". Unfortunately, independent random
sampling is irrelevant for many acquisition devices owing to acquisition
constraints. To overcome this limitation, the notion of Variable Density
Samplers (VDS) is introduced and defined as a stochastic process with a
prescribed limit empirical measure. It encompasses samplers based on
independent measurements or continuous curves. The latter are crucial to extend
CS results to actual applications. Our main contribution lies in two original
continuous VDS. The first one relies on random walks over the acquisition space
whereas the second one is heuristically driven and rests on the approximate
solution of a Traveling Salesman Problem. Theoretical analysis and
retrospective CS simulations in magnetic resonance imaging highlight that the
TSP-based solution provides improved reconstructed images in terms of
signal-to-noise ratio compared to standard sampling schemes (spiral, radial, 3D
iid...).

analysis. The goal of this paper is to determine practical conditions (on the
initial positions and velocities of agents) ensuring that the agents
asymptotically agree on a common velocity (\ie a flocking behavior is
achieved). For this purpose, we define a notion of hierarchical structure in
the interaction graph which allows to establish such conditions, building upon
previous work on multi-agent systems with switching communication networks.
Though conservative, our approach gives conditions that can be verified a

the fact that multiple views of the same scene allow separating intrinsic from

result is a descriptor that has the same complexity of single-view HOG, and can
be compared in the same manner, but exploits multiple views to better trade off
insensitivity to nuisance variability with specificity to intrinsic
variability. We also introduce a novel multi-view wide-baseline matching

concepts combine and interact is one of the main challenges for the scholars

serious hindrances when dealing with combinations of concepts and concept
vagueness. One of the main consequences of these difficulties is the existence
of borderline cases which is hardly explainable from the point of view of
classical (fuzzy set) logic and probability theory. Resting on a
quantum-theoretic approach which successfully models conjunctions and
disjuncions of two concepts, we propound a quantum probability model in Fock
space which accords with the experimental data collected by Alxatib and
Pelletier (2011) on borderline contradictions. Our model allows one to explain
the occurrence of the latter contradictions in terms of genuine quantum
effects, such as contextuality, superposition, interference and emergence. In
particular, we claim that it is the specific mechanism of `emergence of a new
concept' that is responsible of these deviations from classical logical
thinking in the cognitive studies on human thought. This result seems to be
compatible with a recent interesting application of quantum probabilistic
modeling in the study of borderline vagueness (Blutner, Pothos & Bruza, 2012),

search algorithm for named entity recognition, which can detect prefix and
suffix sharing. The semantic analyses are implemented as rule-based finite
state machines. Analyses include negation, location, modification, family
history, and ignoring. Result: The processing speed of NILE is hundreds to

This thesis was organized into three chapters.
  In the first, we described the necessary concepts and definitions about Lie
algebras as well as a few helpful theorems that are necessary to understand the
project. We also reviewed many concepts from linear algebra that are essential
to the research.
  The second chapter was occupied with a description of how we went about
classifying the Lie algebras. In particular, it outlined the basic premise of
the classification: that we can use the automorphisms of the nilradical of the
Lie algebra to find a basis with the simplest structure equations possible. In
addition, it outlined a few other methods that also helped find this basis.
Finally, this chapter included a discussion of the canonical forms of certain
types of matrices that arose in the project.
  The third chapter presented a sample of the classification of the seven
dimensional Lie algebras. In it, we proceeded step-by-step through the
classification of the Lie algebras whose nilradical was one of four
specifically chosen because they were representative of the different types
that arose during the project.
  In the appendices, we presented our results in a list of the multiplication
tables of the isomorphism classes found.

in enzyme networks. Here, a substrate is reversibly modified by two
antagonistic enzymes (a ""push-pull"" system) and the fraction in modified state
undergoes a sharp switching from near-zero to near-unity at a critical value of
the ratio of the enzyme concentrations, under saturation conditions. ZOU and
its extensions have been studied for several decades now, ever since the
seminal paper of Goldbeter and Koshland (1981); however, a complete
probabilistic treatment, important for the study of fluctuations in finite
populations, is still lacking. In this paper, we study ZOU using a modular
approach, akin to the total quasi-steady state approximation (tQSSA). This
approach leads to a set of Fokker-Planck (drift-diffusion) equations for the
probability distributions of the intermediate enzyme-bound complexes, as well
as the modified/unmodified fractions of substrate molecules. We obtain explicit
expressions for various average fractions and their fluctuations in the linear
noise approximation (LNA). The emergence of a ""critical point"" for the
switching transition is rigorously established. New analytical results are
derived for the average and variance of the fractional substrate concentration
in various chemical states in the near-critical regime. For the total fraction
in the modified state, the variance is shown to be a maximum near the critical
point and decays algebraically away from it, similar to a second-order phase
transition. The new analytical results are compared with existing ones as well
as detailed numerical simulations using a Gillespie algorithm.

atomistic representation for electron transport for realistically extended
nano-scaled semiconductor devices that might contain millions of atoms. In this
paper an environment-aware and transferable TB model suitable for electronic
structure and transport simulations in technologically relevant metals,
metallic alloys, metal nanostructures and metallic interface systems is
described. Part I of this paper describes the development and validation of the
new TB model.
  The new model incorporates intra-atomic diagonal and off-diagonal elements
for implicit self-consistency and greater transferability across bonding
environments. The dependence of the on-site energies on strain has been
obtained by appealing to the Moments Theorem that links closed electron paths
in the system to energy moments of angular momentum resolved local density of
states obtained ab-initio. The model matches self-consistent DFT electronic
structure results for bulk FCC metals with and without strain, metallic alloys,
metallic interfaces and metallic nanostructures with high accuracy and can be
used in predictive electronic structure and transport problems in metallic
systems at realistically extended length scales

the sky allows observations with ground-based observatories both in the
northern and southern hemispheres. Here we report on long-term observations of
HESS J0632+057 conducted with the VERITAS and H.E.S.S. Cherenkov Telescopes and
the X-ray Satellite Swift, spanning a time range from 2004 to 2012 and covering
most of the system's orbit. The VHE emission is found to be variable, and is
correlated with that at X-ray energies. An orbital period of $315 ^{+6}_{-4}$
days is derived from the X-ray data set, which is compatible with previous
results, $P = (321 \pm 5$) days. The VHE light curve shows a distinct maximum
at orbital phases close to 0.3, or about 100 days after periastron passage,
which coincides with the periodic enhancement of the X-ray emission.
Furthermore, the analysis of the TeV data shows for the first time a
statistically significant ($> 6.5 \sigma$) detection at orbital phases
0.6--0.9. The obtained gamma-ray and X-ray light curves and the correlation of
the source emission at these two energy bands are discussed in the context of
the recent ephemeris obtained for the system. Our results are compared to those
reported for other gamma-ray binaries.

deriving $m$-Liouville theorems. We show that under certain assumptions on the

$(d+1)$-Liouville theorem. This can be considered as a higher dimensional
counterpart of the celebrated conjecture of De Giorgi for the Allen-Cahn

profile of monotone and bounded solutions of the Allen-Cahn equation appears
towards constructing higher dimensional Liouville theorems.

actuate a set of switches to distribute power from generators to loads, while

reduce expensive re-design steps in current design methodologies, such a
control problem is generally addressed based on minor incremental changes on
top of consolidated solutions, since it is difficult to estimate the impact of
earlier design decisions on the final implementation. In this paper, we
introduce a methodology for the design space exploration and virtual
prototyping of EPS supervisory control protocols, following the platform-based
design (PBD) paradigm. Moreover, we describe the modeling infrastructure that
supports the methodology. In PBD, design space exploration is carried out as a
sequence of refinement steps from the initial specification towards a final
implementation, by mapping higher-level behavioral models into a set of library
components at a lower level of abstraction. In our flow, the system
specification is captured using SysML requirement and structure diagrams.
State-machine diagrams enable verification of the control protocol at a high
level of abstraction, while lowerlevel hybrid models, implemented in Simulink,
are used to verify properties related to physical quantities, such as time,
voltage and current values. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated on
a prototype EPS control protocol design.

that the consequent intermittent fluctuations in the air mass flow into the

subtraction of the bias induced by second-order effects. For a cosmic-variance
limited experiment with $l_{\rm max} = 2000$, the bias on a local signal is
$f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc} =0.73$ negligible for equilateral and orthogonal signals.

$Q = \alpha_Q(\nabla E - U \nabla.E/3)$, where the quadrupolarizability
$\alpha_Q$ is proportional to the squared molecular quadrupole moment. Using
this equation of state, a generalized expression for the Born energy of an ion
dissolved in quadrupolar solvent is obtained. It turns out that the potential
and the energy of a point charge in a quadrupolar medium are finite. From the
obtained Born energy, the partial molar volume and the partial molar entropy of
a dissolved ion follow. Both are compared to experimental data for a large
number of simple ions in aqueous solutions. From the comparison the value of
the quadrupolar length $L_Q$ is determined, $L_Q = \sqrt{\alpha_Q/3\epsilon}=
1-2 {\AA}$. Further, the extended Debye-H\""uckel model is generalized to ions
in a quadrupolar solvent. If quadrupole terms are allowed in the macroscopic
Coulomb law, they result in suppression of the gradient of the electric field.
In result, the electric double layer is slightly expanded. The activity
coefficients obtained within this model involve three characteristic lengths:
Debye length, ion radius and quadrupolar length $L_Q$. Comparison to
experimental data shows that minimal distance between ions is equal to the sum
of their bare ion radii; the concept for ion hydration as an obstacle for ions

differential equation that is generally impossible to be solved analytically.
Even worse, model-based approaches cannot be used for approximately solving HJI
equation, when the accurate system model is unavailable or costly to obtain in
practice. To overcome these difficulties, an off-policy reinforcement leaning
(RL) method is introduced to learn the solution of HJI equation from real
system data instead of mathematical system model, and its convergence is
proved. In the off-policy RL method, the system data can be generated with
arbitrary policies rather than the evaluating policy, which is extremely
important and promising for practical systems. For implementation purpose, a
neural network (NN) based actor-critic structure is employed and a least-square
NN weight update algorithm is derived based on the method of weighted
residuals. Finally, the developed NN-based off-policy RL method is tested on a
linear F16 aircraft plant, and further applied to a rotational/translational

constellation of 27 Galileo spacecraft together with those of the existing
LAGEOS-type satellites to improve the accuracy of the past and ongoing tests of
the Lense-Thirring (LT) effect by removing the bias of a larger number of even
zonal harmonics $J_{\ell}$ than either done or planned so far. Actually, it
seems a difficult goal to be realistically achieved for a number of reasons.
First, the LT range signature of a Galileo-type satellite is as little as $0.5$
mm over 3-days arcs, corresponding to a node rate of just $\dot\Omega_{\rm
LT}=2$ milliarcseconds per year (mas yr$^{-1}$). Some tesseral and sectorial
ocean tides such as $K_1,K_2$ induce long-period harmonic node perturbations
with frequencies which are integer multiples of the extremely slow Galileo's
node rate $\dot\Omega$ completing a full cycle in about 40 yr. Thus, over time
spans $T$ of some years they would act as superimposed semi-secular aliasing
trends. Since the coefficients of the $J_{\ell}$-free multisatellite linear
combinations are determined only by the semimajor axis $a$, the eccentricity
$e$ and the inclination $I$, which are nominally equal for all the Galileo
satellites, it is not possible to include all of them. Even by using only one
Galileo spacecraft together with the LAGEOS family would be unfeasible because
the resulting Galileo coefficient would be $\gtrsim 1$, thus enhancing the
aliasing impact of the uncancelled non-conservative and tidal perturbations.

pronounced as in existing lattice results. A more quantitative description of
the electric sector near the deconfinement phase transition certainly requires
another physical ingredient sensitive to the order parameter of the transition.

degenerate almost everywhere. This is at apparent odds with the non- degeneracy
of asymptotically flat metrics near spatial infinity. Koslowski generalised the
LQG representation so as to describe states labelled by smooth non- degenerate
triad fields. His representation was further studied by Sahlmann with a view to
imposing gauge and spatial diffeomorphism invariance through group averaging
methods. Motivated by the desire to model asymptotically flat quantum geometry
by states with triad labels which are non- degenerate at infinity but not
necessarily so in the interior, we initiate a generalisation of Sahlmann's
considerations to triads of varying degeneracy. In doing so, we include
delicate phase contributions to the averaging procedure which are crucial for
the correct implementation of the gauge and diffeomorphism constraints, and
whose existence can be traced to the background exponential functions recently
constructed by one of us. Our treatment emphasizes the role of symmetries of
quantum states in the averaging procedure. Semianalyticity, influential in the
proofs of the beautiful uniqueness results for LQG, plays a key role in our
considerations. As a by product, we re- derive the group averaging map for
standard LQG, highlighting the role of state symmetries and explicitly
exhibiting the essential uniqueness of its specification.

giant planet and a self-gravitating gas disk. We investigate how the disk's
self-gravity affects the gap formation process and the migration of the giant
planet. Two series of 1-D and 2-D hydrodynamic simulations are performed. We
select several surface densities and focus on the gravitationally stable
region. To obtain more reliable gravity torques exerted on the planet, a
refined treatment of disk's gravity is adopted in the vicinity of the planet.
Our results indicate that the net effect of the disk's self-gravity on the gap
formation process depends on the surface density of the disk. We notice that
there are two critical values, \Sigma_I and \Sigma_II. When the surface density
of the disk is lower than the first one, \Sigma_0 < \Sigma_I, the effect of
self-gravity suppresses the formation of a gap. When \Sigma_0 > \Sigma_I, the
self-gravity of the gas tends to benefit the gap formation process and enlarge
the width/depth of the gap. According to our 1-D and 2-D simulations, we
estimate the first critical surface density \Sigma_I \approx 0.8MMSN. This
effect increases until the surface density reaches the second critical value
\Sigma_II. When \Sigma_0 > \Sigma_II, the gravitational turbulence in the disk
becomes dominant and the gap formation process is suppressed again. Our 2-D
simulations show that this critical surface density is around 3.5MMSN. We also
study the associated orbital evolution of a giant planet. Under the effect of
the disk's self-gravity, the migration rate of the giant planet increases when
the disk is dominated by gravitational turbulence. We show that the migration
timescale associates with the effective viscosity and can be up to 10^4 yr.

contact binaries, according to which a detached binary might evolve into
contact by evolutionary expansion of the components, or angular momentum loss
through the effect of magnetic braking (MB). We have carried out a detailed
binary population synthesis (BPS) study of this channel, and obtained the
parameter regions for detached binaries to evolve into contact. Combining the
observations from the $\emph{Kepler}$ satellite with our results, we found that
the ratio of the birth rate of the progenitors of contact binaries to that of
contact binaries is greater than about 1.2. This suggests that for the
detached-binary channel, the progenitors can be sufficient to produce observed
contact binaries. In this channel, we find that the distribution of orbital
period for contact binaries has a peak at about 0.25 days and a tail extending
to longer periods, and the formation timescale of contact binaries has a large
range from $\sim1$\,Myr to 15\,Gyr. These results show that the detached-binary
channel could explain satisfactorily the main observational characteristics of
contact binaries, in particular the distribution of orbital period shown by the
$\emph{Kepler}$ observations and the existence of very young contact binaries.

spontaneous two-photon fluorescence is monitored with a single photodetector,

division multiplex- ing (OFDM) has been the subject of a considerable volume of
work. In this paper, a complete parameterization of orthogonal Weyl-Heisenberg
sets and their corresponding biorthogonal sets is given. Several examples of
Weyl-Heisenberg sets designed using this parameterization are pre- sented,
which in simulations show a high potential for enabling OFDM robust to
frequency offset, timing mismatch, and narrow-band interference.

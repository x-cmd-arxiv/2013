of $C_{\rm 6}^{}$ interaction parameters for Ag and Ir atoms. To this end a
QM:QM scheme is employed using the PBE functional and RPA as well as MP2
calculation as a reference. The obtained $C_{\rm 6}^{}$ coefficients were
applied to calculate dissociation curves of selected IrPS-Ag$_n$ complexes and
binding energies of derivatives containing oxygen and sulphur as heteroatoms in
the ligands. Comparing different $C_{\rm 6}^{}$ parameters it is concluded that
RPA-based dispersion correction produces binding energies close to standard D2
and D3 models, whereas MP2-derived parameters overestimate these energies.

specifically those less than ~100 Myr old. Most age determination methods that
we discuss are primarily applicable to groups of stars but can be used to
estimate the age of individual objects. A reliable age scale is established
above 20 Myr from measurement of the Lithium Depletion Boundary (LDB) in young
clusters, and consistency is shown between these ages and those from the upper
main sequence and the main sequence turn-off -- if modest core convection and
rotation is included in the models of higher-mass stars. Other available
methods for age estimation include the kinematics of young groups, placing
stars in Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams, pulsations and seismology, surface
gravity measurement, rotation and activity, and lithium abundance. We review
each of these methods and present known strengths and weaknesses. Below ~20
Myr, both model-dependent and observational uncertainties grow, the situation
is confused by the possibility of age spreads, and no reliable absolute ages
yet exist. The lack of absolute age calibration below 20 Myr should be borne in
mind when considering the lifetimes of protostellar phases and circumstellar
material.

constructed from two weak ferromagnetic AFeO$_3$ perovskites with different A
cations using RHEED-monitored pulsed laser deposition. The polarisation arises
through the removal of inversion centres present within the individual AFeO$_3$
components. This symmetry reduction is a result of combining ordering on the A
site, imposed by the periodicity of the grown structure, with appropriate
orientations of the octahedral tilting characteristic of the perovskite units
themselves, according to simple symmetry-controlled rules. The polarisation is
robust against A site interdiffusion between the two layers which produces a
sinusoidally modulated occupancy that retains the coupling of translational and
point symmetries required to produce a polar structure. Magnetization and
magneto-optical Kerr rotation measurements show that the heterostructure's
magnetic structure is similar to that of the individual components. Evidence of
the polarity was obtained from second harmonic generation and piezoelectric
force microscopy measurements. Modeling of the piezoresponse allows extraction
of $d_{33}$ (approximately 10 pC/N) of the heterostructure, which is in

extract valuable cosmological information from ongoing and future weak lensing
surveys which is not contained in standard 2nd-order statistics, due to the
non-Gaussianity of the shear field. Aperture mass statistics are an appropriate
choice for 3rd-order statistics due to their simple form and their ability to
separate E- and B-modes of the shear. However, it has been demonstrated that
2nd-order aperture mass statistics suffer from E-/B-mode mixing because it is
impossible to reliably estimate the shapes of close pairs of galaxies. This
finding has triggered developments of several new 2nd-order statistical
measures for cosmic shear. Whether the same developments are needed for
3rd-order shear statistics is largely determined by how severe this E-/B-mixing
is for 3rd-order statistics. We test 3rd-order aperture mass statistics against
E-/B-mode mixing, and find that the level of contamination is well-described by
a function of $\theta/\theta_{\rm min}$, with $\theta_{\rm min}$ being the
cut-off scale. At angular scales of $\theta > 10 \;\theta_{\rm min}$, the
decrease in the E-mode signal due to E-/B-mode mixing is smaller than 1
percent, and the leakage into B-modes is even less. For typical small-scale
cut-offs this E-/B-mixing is negligible on scales larger than a few arcminutes.
Therefore, 3rd-order aperture mass statistics can safely be used to separate E-
and B-modes and infer cosmological information, for ground-based surveys as
well as forthcoming space-based surveys such as Euclid.

advanced by Ellis and Perry (1979), we derived scaling relations using data

two cosmological models used here predicts theoretical curves in better
agreement with the observed ones, that is, one cannot identify a clear and
detectable difference in galactic evolution incurred by the galaxies of our

  Solvable Statistical Model","Talk given at the Helmholtz International Summer School ""Physics of
  Heavy Quarks and Hadrons"", held in Dubna, Russia, July 15-28, 2013",,,,"nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a few explicit counterexamples to the widely spread belief about
an exclusive role of the bimodal nuclear fragment size distributions as the
first order phase transition signal. In thermodynamic limit the bimodality may
appear at the supercritical temperatures due to the negative values of the
surface tension coefficient. Such a result is found within a novel exactly
solvable formulation of the simplified statistical multifragmentation model
based on the virial expansion for a system of the nuclear fragments of all
sizes. The developed statistical model corresponds to the compressible nuclear
liquid with the tricritical endpoint located at one third of the normal nuclear
density. Its exact solution for finite volumes demonstrates the bimodal
fragment size distribution right inside the finite volume analog of a gaseous
phase. These counterexamples clearly demonstrate the pitfalls of Hill approach
to phase transitions in finite systems.

IceCube Neutrino Observatory from May 2009 to May 2010, when the array was
running in its 59-string configuration. The data sample was optimized to
contain muon neutrino induced events with a background contamination of
atmospheric muons of less than 1%. These data, which are dominated by
atmospheric neutrinos, are analyzed with a global likelihood fit to search for
possible contributions of prompt atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos,
neither of which have yet been identified. Such signals are expected to follow
a harder energy spectrum than conventional atmospheric neutrinos. In addition,
the zenith angle distribution differs for astrophysical and atmospheric
signals. A global fit of the reconstructed energies and directions of observed
events is performed, including possible neutrino flux contributions for an
astrophysical signal and atmospheric backgrounds as well as systematic
uncertainties of the experiment and theoretical predictions. The best fit
yields an astrophysical signal flux for $\nu_\mu + \bar\nu_\mu $ of $E^2 \cdot
\Phi (E) = 0.25 \cdot 10^{-8} \textrm{GeV} \textrm{cm}^{-2} \textrm{s}^{-1}
\textrm{sr}^{-1}$, and a zero prompt component. Although the sensitivity of
this analysis for astrophysical neutrinos surpasses the Waxman and Bahcall
upper bound, the experimental limit at 90% confidence level is a factor of 1.5
above at a flux of $E^2 \cdot \Phi (E) = 1.44 \cdot 10^{-8} \textrm{GeV}

under the reflection about the $x_1$-axis, and the function $h$ accounts for a
nonsymmetric decaying perturbation: $h(\cdot, t)\to 0$ as $t\to\infty$. In one
of our main theorems, we prove the asymptotic symmetry of each bounded positive
solution $u$. The novelty of this result is that the asymptotic symmetry is
established even for solutions that are not assumed uniformly positive. In
particular, some equilibria of the limit time-autonomous problem (the problem
with $h\equiv 0$) with a nontrivial nodal set may occur in the $\omega$-limit
set of $u$ and this prevents one from applying common techniques based on the
method of moving hyperplanes. The goal of our second main theorem is to
classify the positive entire solutions of the time-autonomous problem. We prove
that if $U$ is a positive entire solution, then one of the following applies:
(i) for each $t\in \mathbb{R}$, $U(\cdot,t)$ is even in $x_1$ and decreasing in
$x_1>0$, (ii) $U$ is an equilibrium, (iii) $U$ is a connecting orbit from an
equilibrium with a nontrivial nodal set to a set consisting of functions which
are even in $x_1$ and decreasing in $x_1>0$, (iv) is a heteroclinic connecting
orbit between two equilibria with a nontrivial nodal set.

associations compiled so far. The catalog comprises more than 7000 ionized
regions, extracted from 306 galaxies observed by the CALIFA survey. We describe
the procedures used to detect, select, and analyse the spectroscopic properties
of these ionized regions. In the current study we focus on the characterization
of the radial gradient of the oxygen abundance in the ionized gas, based on the
study of the deprojected distribution of HII regions. We found that all
galaxies without clear evidence of an interaction present a common gradient in
the oxygen abundance, with a characteristic slope of alpha = -0.1 dex/re
between 0.3 and 2 disk effective radii, and a scatter compatible with random
fluctuations around this value, when the gradient is normalized to the disk
effective radius. The slope is independent of morphology, incidence of bars,
absolute magnitude or mass. Only those galaxies with evidence of interactions
and/or clear merging systems present a significant shallower gradient,
consistent with previous results. The majority of the 94 galaxies with H ii
regions detected beyond 2 disk effective radii present a flattening in the
oxygen abundance. The flattening is statistically significant. We cannot
provide with a conclusive answer regarding the origin of this flattening.
However, our results indicate that its origin is most probably related to the
secular evolution of galaxies. Finally, we find a drop/truncation of the oxygen
abundance in the inner regions for 26 of the galaxies. All of them are
non-interacting, mostly unbarred, Sb/Sbc galaxies. This feature is associated
with a central star-forming ring, which suggests that both features are
produced by radial gas flows induced by resonance processes.

structure built from two neutrons and two protons coupled to total isospin T=0.
The structure of the collective quartets is determined by an iterative
variational procedure based on a sequence of diagonalizations of the pairing
Hamiltonian in spaces of reduced size. The accuracy of the quartet model is
tested for N=Z nuclei carrying valence nucleons outside the $^{16}$O,
$^{40}$Ca, and $^{100}$Sn cores. The comparison with the exact solutions of the
pairing Hamiltonian, obtained by shell model diagonalization, shows that the
quartet model is able to describe the isovector pairing energy with very high
precision. The predictions of the quartet model are also compared to those of
the simpler quartet condensation model in which all the collective quartets are
assumed to be identical.

such codes was known, but this is in fact the first explicit construction of

  Our codes are subcodes of the well-known Gabidulin codes, which encode
linearized polynomials of low degree via their values at a collection of
linearly independent points. The subcode is picked by restricting the message
polynomials to an ${\mathbb F}_h$-subspace that evades the structured subspaces
over an extension field ${\mathbb F}_{h^t}$ that arise in the linear-algebraic

have received much attention recently in the context of network coding. We also
give explicit subcodes of folded Reed-Solomon (RS) codes with small folding

polarization-resolved photoluminescence measurements, we observe large spin
orientation of neutral and charged excitons generated by both circularly and
linearly polarized light, with a splitting of the trion spectrum into a doublet
at large vertical electrical field. These observations can be explained by
locking of spin and layer pseudospin in a given valley. Because up and down
spin states are localized in opposite layers, spin relaxation is substantially
suppressed, while the doublet emerges as a manifestation of electrically
induced spin splitting resulting from the interlayer bias. The observed
distinctive behavior of the trion doublet under circularly and linearly
polarized light excitation further provides spectroscopic evidence of
interlayer and intralayer trion species, a promising step toward optical
manipulation in van der Waals heterostructures through the control of
interlayer excitons.

collisions at RHIC and the LHC provides an opportunity to study a broad class
of flow observables. This paper explores the correlations among harmonic flow
coefficients $v_n$ and their phases $\Phi_n$, and the rapidity fluctuation of
$v_n$. The study is carried out usin Pb+Pb events generated by the AMPT model
with fixed impact parameter. The overall ellipticity/triangularity of events is
varied by selecting on the eccentricities $\epsilon_n$ or the magnitudes of the
flow vector $q_n$ for n=2 and 3, respectively. The responses of the $v_n$, the
event-plane correlations, and the rapidity fluctuations, to the change in
$\epsilon_n$ and $q_n$ are then systematized. Strong positive correlations are
observed among all even harmonics $v_2, v_4$, and $v_6$ (all increase with
$q_2$), between $v_2$ and $v_5$ (both increase with $q_2$) and between $v_3$
and $v_5$ (both increase with $q_3$), consistent with the effects of nonlinear
collective response. In contrast, an anti-correlation is observed between $v_2$
and $v_3$ similar to that seen between $\epsilon_2$ and $\epsilon_3$. These
correlation patterns are found to be independent of whether selecting on $q_n$
or $\epsilon_n$, validating the ability of $q_n$ in selecting the initial
geometry. A forward/backward asymmetry of $v_n(\eta)$ is observed for events
selected on $q_n$ but not on $\epsilon_n$, reflecting dynamical fluctuations
exposed by the $q_n$ selection. Many event-plane correlators show good
agreement between $q_n$ and $\epsilon_n$ selections, suggesting that their
variations with $q_n$ are controlled by the change of $\epsilon_n$ in the
initial geometry. Hence these correlators may serve as promising observables
for disentangling the fluctuations generated in various stages of the evolution
of the matter created in heavy ion collisions.

invalidation, parameter and state estimation. Both classes of methods use
different types of data, i.e. deterministic or probabilistic data, which allow
different statements and applications. Ideally, however, all available data
should be used in estimation and model invalidation methods. This paper
presents an estimation and model invalidation framework combining set-based and
probabilistically uncertain data for polynomial continuous-time systems. In
particular, uncertain data on the moments and the support is used without the
need to make explicit assumptions on the type of probability densities. The
paper derives pointwise-in-time outer approximations of the moments of the
probability densities associated with the states and parameters of the system.
These approximations can be interpreted as guaranteed confidence intervals for
the moment estimates. Furthermore, guaranteed bounds on the probability masses
on subsets are derived and allow an estimation of the unknown probability
densities. To calculate the estimates, the dynamics of the probability
densities of the state trajectories are found by occupation measures of the
nonlinear dynamics. This allows the construction of an infinite-dimensional
linear program which incorporates the set- and moment-based data. This linear
program is relaxed by a hierarchy of LMI problems providing, as shown
elsewhere, an almost uniformly convergent sequence of outer approximations of
the estimated sets. The approach is demonstrated with numerical examples.

connection of all these with the observable and physical properties of
galaxies. We measure significant deviations in the shape of the BAO peak from
the expectations of a linear bias model built on top of the nonlinear dark
matter distribution. We find that the galaxy correlation function shows an
excess close to the maximum of the BAO peak ($r\sim110 Mpc/h$) and a deficit at
$r\sim90 Mpc/h$. Depending on the redshift, selection criteria and number
density of the galaxy samples, these bias distortions can be up to 5% in
amplitude. They are, however, largely absorbed by marginalization over nuisance
parameters in current analytical modelling of the BAO peak in configuration
space, in particular into the parameter that controls the broadening due to
nonlinear evolution. As a result, the galaxy formation effects detected here
are unlikely to bias the high-precision measurements planned by the upcoming
generation of wide-field galaxy surveys.

Comments are welcome",,,,"math.AG hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The notion of a universal building associated with a point in the Hitchin
base is introduced. This is a building equipped with a harmonic map from a
Riemann surface that is initial among harmonic maps which induce the given
cameral cover of the Riemann surface. In the rank one case, the universal
building is the leaf space of the quadratic differential defining the point in
the Hitchin base.
  The main conjectures of this paper are: (1) the universal building always
exists; (2) the harmonic map to the universal building controls the asymptotics
of the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence and the non-abelian Hodge correspondence;
(3) the singularities of the universal building give rise to Spectral Networks;
and (4) the universal building encodes the data of a 3d Calabi-Yau category
whose space of stability conditions has a connected component that contains the
Hitchin base.
  The main theorem establishes the existence of the universal building,
conjecture (3), as well as the Riemann-Hilbert part of conjecture (2), in the
case of the rank two example introduced in the seminal work of
Berk-Nevins-Roberts on higher order Stokes phenomena. It is also shown that the
asymptotics of the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence is always controlled by a
harmonic map to a certain building, which is constructed as the asymptotic cone
of a symmetric space.

holographic QCD, and Monte Carlo studies, that the QCD vacuum is permeated by
discrete quasivacua separated by domain walls across which the local value of
the topological $\theta$ parameter jumps by $\pm2\pi$. In the 2-dimensional
$CP^{N-1}$ sigma model, a pointlike charge is a domain wall, and $\theta$
describes the background electric flux and the polarization of charged pairs in
the vacuum. We show that the screening process, and the role of $\theta$ as an
order parameter describing electric polarization, are naturally formulated in
terms of Bloch wave eigenstates of the Dirac Hamiltonian in the background
gauge field. This formulation is similar to the Berry phase description of
electric polarization and quantized charge transport in topological insulators.
The Bloch waves are quasiperiodic superpositions of localized Dirac zero modes.
They define a Berry connection around the Brillouin zone of the zero mode band
which describes the local polarization of vacuum pairs, analogous to its role
in topological insulator theory. In 4D Yang-Mills theory, the $\theta$ domain
walls are 2+1-dimensional Chern-Simons membranes. The interpretation of the
$\theta$ parameter as a Berry phase describing the local polarization of
brane-antibrane pairs follows from the descent equations of 4D Yang-Mills
theory.

  Lambert Academic Publishing (2014). ISBN:978-3-659-52065-5",,,,"gr-qc hep-th math.DG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  The Petrov classification is an important algebraic classification for the
Weyl tensor valid in 4-dimensional space-times. In this thesis such
classification is generalized to manifolds of arbitrary dimension and
signature. This is accomplished by interpreting the Weyl tensor as a linear
operator on the bundle of p-forms, for any p, and computing the Jordan
canonical form of this operator. Throughout this work the spaces are assumed to
be complexified, so that different signatures correspond to different reality
conditions, providing a unified treatment. A higher-dimensional generalization
of the so-called self-dual manifolds is also investigated.
  The most important result related to the Petrov classification is the
Goldberg-Sachs theorem. Here are presented two partial generalizations of such
theorem valid in even-dimensional manifolds. One of these generalizations
states that certain algebraic constraints on the Weyl operator imply the
existence of an integrable maximally isotropic distribution. The other version
of the generalized Goldberg-Sachs theorem states that these algebraic
constraints imply the existence of a null congruence whose optical scalars obey
special restrictions.
  On the pursuit of these results the spinorial formalism in 6 dimensions was
developed from the very beginning, using group representation theory. Since the
spinors are full of geometric significance and are suitable tools to deal with
isotropic structures, it should not come as a surprise that they provide a
fruitful framework to investigate the issues treated on this thesis. In
particular, the generalizations of the Goldberg-Sachs theorem acquire an
elegant form in terms of the pure spinors.

resolve the topological nature of surface states by uniquely accessing the
surface electronic structure of the low temperature anomalous transport regime
through combining state-of-the-art laser- and synchrotron-based angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) with or without spin resolution. A
combination of low temperature and ultra-high resolution (laser) which is
lacking in previous ARPES studies of this compound is the key to resolve the
possible existence of topological surface state in SmB6. Here we outline an
experimental algorithm to systematically explore the topological versus trivial
or mixed (topological and trivial surface state admixture as in the first 3D TI
Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$) nature of the surface states in Kondo and mixed valence
insulators. We conclude based on this methodology that the observed topology of
the surface Fermi surface in our low temperature data considered within the
level of current resolution is consistent with the theoretically predicted
topological picture, suggesting a topological origin of the dominant in-gap
ARPES signal in SmB6.}

sufficient conditions for the existence of transverse invariant measures. In
particular we prove that when this foliated geodesic flow preserves a Gibbs

unstable horospheres, then it has to be obtained by combining a transverse
invariant measure and the Liouville measure on the leaves. On the other hand we

genomic loci. How to characterize concordant signals between two rank lists is
a common problem with many applications. One example is measuring the
reproducibility between two replicate experiments. Another is to characterize
the interaction and co-binding between two transcription factors (TF) based on
the overlap between their binding sites. As an exploratory tool, the simple
Venn diagram approach can be used to show the common loci between two lists.
However, this approach does not account for changes in overlap with decreasing
ranks, which may contain useful information for studying similarities or
dissimilarities of the two lists. The recently proposed irreproducible
discovery rate (IDR) approach compares two rank lists using a copula mixture
model. This model considers the rank correlation between two lists. However, it
only analyzes the genomic loci that appear in both lists, thereby only
measuring signal concordance in the overlapping set of the two lists. When two
lists have little overlap but loci in their overlapping set have high
concordance in terms of rank, the original IDR approach may misleadingly claim
that the two rank lists are highly reproducible when they are indeed not. In
this article, we propose to address the various issues above by translating the
problem into a bivariate survival problem. A survival copula mixture model is
developed to characterize concordant signals in two rank lists. The
effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated using both simulations and real
data.

the status of the quantum state: Is it real/ontic (an objective state of
Nature) or epistemic (a state of the observer's knowledge)? In contrast to
recent approaches to wave function ontology, that are based on realist models
of quantum theory, here we recast the question as a problem of communication
between a sender (Bob), who uses interaction-free measurements, and a receiver
(Alice), who observes an interference pattern in a Mach-Zehnder set-up. An
advantage of our approach is that it allows us to define the concept of
""physical"", apart from ""real"". In instances of counterfactual quantum
communication, reality is ascribed to the interaction-freely measured wave
function ($\psi$) because Alice deterministically infers Bob's measurement. On
the other hand, $\psi$ does not correspond to the physical transmission of a
particle because it produced no detection on Bob's apparatus. We therefore
conclude that the wave function in this case (and by extension, generally) is
real, but not physical. Characteristically for classical phenomena, the reality
and physicality of objects are equivalent, whereas for quantum phenomena, the
former is strictly weaker. As a concrete application of this idea, the
nonphysical reality of the wavefunction is shown to be the basic nonclassical
phenomenon that underlies the security of CQC.

network coupling becomes vanishingly sparse as network size grows -- a
phenomenon that depends on ``extensive chaos,"" as previously discovered for
balanced networks without stimulus drive. Moreover, we show how spike pattern

preferred frame, at each spacetime point. We then examine the consequences of
this gravitational Lorentz symmetry breaking in the orbital evolution of binary
pulsars, focusing on the dissipative effects. We find that Lorentz symmetry
breaking modifies these effects, and thus the orbital dynamics, in two
different ways. First, it generically causes the emission of dipolar radiation,
which makes the orbital separation decrease faster than in General Relativity.
Second, the quadrupole component of the emission is also modified. The orbital
evolution depends critically on the sensitivities of the stars, which measure
how their binding energies depend on the motion relative to the preferred
frame. We calculate the sensitivities numerically and compute the predicted
orbital decay rate of binary pulsars in Lorentz-violating gravity. By testing

in which this formalism is applied. We obtain all the possible gaugings of the
theory and its extended field content. We also classify the orbits of gaugings
of maximal and half-maximal $d=9,8,7$ supergravity and study their
(non-)geometric origins by means of double field theory. By performing a
generalized Scherk-Schwarz dimensional reduction of this T-duality-invariant
formalism, we reproduce the orbits found by means of the embedding-tensor
formalism. Finally, we study a formalism to describe BPS multicenter solutions
for $N=2$, $D=4$ theories with quadratic prepotentials. Based on the charge
vector space, this approach allows for the treatment of these solutions in a
more general way.

and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) affects the observable properties of
radio-loud AGN at early epochs. At high z the magnetic energy density in the
radio lobes of powerful radio-loud quasars can be exceeded by the energy
density of the CMB (because of its (1+z)^4 dependance). In this case,
relativistic electrons cool preferentially by scattering off CMB photons,
rather than by synchrotron. Thus, sources sharing the same intrinsic properties
have different extended radio and X-ray luminosities when located at different
z: more distant sources are less luminous in radio and more luminous in X-rays
than their closer counterparts. Instead, in compact regions where the local
magnetic field still exceeds the CMB in terms of energy density, synchrotron
radiation would be unaffected by the presence of the CMB. Such regions include
the compact inner jet and the so-called hot spots in the radio lobes. The
decrease in radio luminosity is larger in misaligned sources, whose radio flux
is dominated by the extended isotropic component. These sources can fail
detection in current flux limited radio surveys, and therefore they are
possibly under-represented in the associated samples. As the cooling time is
longer for lower energy electrons, the radio luminosity deficit due to the CMB
photons is less important at low radio frequencies. Therefore objects not
detected so far in current surveys at a few GHz could be picked up by low
frequency deep surveys, such as LOFAR and SKA. Until then, we can estimate the
number of high redshift radio-loud AGNs through the census of their aligned
proxies, i.e., blazars. Indeed, their observed radio emission arises in the
inner and strongly magnetized compact core of the relativistic jet, and not
affected by inverse Compton scattering off CMB photons.

non-dissipative stress response to a shear deformation rate, a phenomenon
variously known as asymmetric or Hall viscosity, or Lorentz shear response.
Just as the QH effect results from the coupling of Chern-Simons fields of the
effective theory to the electromagnetic field, so also Hall viscosity is found
to arise from coupling of these fields to the 'metric' of the quadratic kinetic
energy. In this paper I derive new physical insights for Hall viscosity by
using an extended semiclassical approach to compute the conductivity of a
single Landau level in a nonuniform electric field. I demonstrate that the
inhomogeneity of an applied electric field is a viable experimentally tunable
parameter for altering the metric, and hence creating strain in the QH state.
Using these results, I argue that Hall viscosity arises from the shearing of
local cyclotron orbits by the applied nonuniform electric fields.

the most probable regions in the NUHGM parameter space, and study the

marginal regions (e.g. Higgs-funnel), but with much less statistical weight.
The prospects for detection at the LHC in this case are quite pessimistic, but
future direct detection experiments like LUX and XENON1T, will be able to probe
this scenario. In contrast, when allowing other DM components, the prospects
for detection at the LHC become more encouraging -- the most promising signals
being, beside the production of gluinos and squarks, the production of the
heavier chargino and neutralino states, which lead to WZ and same-sign WW final
states -- and direct detection remains a complementary, and even more powerful,
way to probe the scenario.

The homogenization of the stellar parameters is an important goal
for large observational spectroscopic surveys, but it is very difficult to
achieve it because of the diversity of the spectroscopic analysis methods used
within a survey, such as spectrum synthesis and the equivalent width method. To
solve this problem, constraints to the spectroscopic analysis can be set, such
as the use of a common line-list. Aims. We present a procedure for selecting
the best spectral lines from a given input line-list, which then allows us to
derive accurate stellar parameters with the equivalent width method. Methods.
To select the lines, we used four very well known benchmark stars, for which we
have high-quality spectra. From an initial line-list, the equivalent width of
each individual line was automatically measured for each benchmark star using
ARES, then we performed a local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis with MOOG to
compute individual abundances. The results allowed us to choose the best lines
which give consistent abundance values for all the benchmark stars from which
we then created a final line-list. Results. To verify its consistency, the
compiled final line-list was tested for a small sample of stars. These stars
were selected to cover different ranges in the parameter space for FGK stars.
We show that the obtained parameters agree well with previously determined
values.

compact binaries in Gaussian coloured noise. For binaries with quasicircular
orbits and non-precessing component spins, considering dominant mode emission
only, if the intrinsic parameters of the binary are known then the optimal
statistic for a single detector is the well-known two-phase matched filter.
However, the matched filter signal-to-noise ratio is /not/ in general an
optimal statistic for an astrophysical population of signals, since their
distribution over the intrinsic parameters will almost certainly not mirror
that of noise events, which is determined by the (Fisher) information metric.
Instead, the optimal statistic for a given astrophysical distribution will be
the Bayes factor, which we approximate using the output of a standard template
matched filter search. We then quantify the possible improvement in number of
signals detected for various populations of non-spinning binaries: for a
distribution of signals uniformly distributed in volume and with component
masses distributed uniformly over the range $1\leq m_{1,2}/M_\odot\leq 24$,
$(m_1+m_2) /M_\odot\leq 25$ at fixed expected SNR, we find $\gtrsim 20\%$ more
signals at a false alarm threshold of $10^{-6}\,$Hz in a single detector. The
method may easily be generalized to binaries with non-precessing spins.

running time of our algorithm (as a function of $n^d$, the number of

previous algorithm for this problem (due to Kane), based on constructions of
unconditional pseudorandom generators for degree-$d$ PTFs, runs in time
$n^{O_{d,c}(1) \cdot \epsilon^{-c}}$ for all $c > 0$.
  The key novel contributions of this work are: A new multivariate central
limit theorem, proved using tools from Malliavin calculus and Stein's Method.
This new CLT shows that any collection of Gaussian polynomials with small
eigenvalues must have a joint distribution which is very close to a
multidimensional Gaussian distribution. A new decomposition of low-degree
multilinear polynomials over Gaussian inputs. Roughly speaking we show that (up
to some small error) any such polynomial can be decomposed into a bounded
number of multilinear polynomials all of which have extremely small
eigenvalues. We use these new ingredients to give a deterministic algorithm for
a Gaussian-space version of the approximate counting problem, and then employ
standard techniques for working with low-degree PTFs (invariance principles and
regularity lemmas) to reduce the original approximate counting problem over the
Boolean hypercube to the Gaussian version.

2005ip, based on Chandra and Swift observations covering from ~1 to 6 years
after the explosion. X-ray spectra in all epochs are well fitted by a thermal
emission model with kT > 7 keV. The somewhat high temperature suggests that the
X-ray emission mainly arises from the circumstellar medium heated by the
forward shock. We find that the spectra taken 2-3 years since the explosion are
heavily absorbed N_H ~ 5e22 cm^{-2}, but the absorption gradually decreases to
the level of the Galactic absorption N_H ~ 4e20 cm^{-2} at the final epoch.
This indicates that the SN went off in a dense circumstellar medium and that
the forward shock has overtaken it. The intrinsic X-ray luminosity stays
constant until the final epoch when it drops by a factor of ~2. The intrinsic
0.2-10 keV luminosity during the plateau phase is measured to be ~1.5e41 erg/s,
ranking SN 2005ip as one of the brightest X-ray SNe. Based on the column
density, we derive a lower-limit of a mass-loss rate to be M_dot ~ 0.015
(V_w/100 km/s) M_sun/yr, which roughly agrees with that inferred from the X-ray
luminosity, M_dot ~ 0.02 (V_w/100 km/s) M_sun/yr, where V_w is the
circumstellar wind speed. Such a high mass-loss rate suggests that the
progenitor star had eruptive mass ejections like a luminous blue variable star.
The total mass ejected in the eruptive period is estimated to be ~15 M_sun,
indicating that the progenitor mass is greater than ~25 M_sun.

code using interfaces can be specified and verified precisely without knowing

from the ejecta launched during an NS-NS merger and powered by a magnetar
central engine. The isotropic-equivalent kinetic energies of both the GRB
blastwave and the kilonova are about $E_{\rm k}\sim 10^{51}$ erg, consistent
with being powered by a near-isotropic magnetar wind. However, this relatively
small value demands that most of the initial rotational energy of the magnetar

radiation. Our results suggest that (i) the progenitor of GRB 130603B would be
a NS-NS binary system, whose merger product would be a supra-massive neutron

gravity deviates from the general relativity (GR) on the large scale. The f(R)
gravity whose strength is controlled to satisfy the current observational
constraints on the cluster scale is adopted as our fiducial model and a large
N-body simulation of high-resolution is utilized for this study. By applying
the minimal spanning tree algorithm to the halo catalogs from the simulation at
various epochs, we identify the main stems of the rich superclusters located in
the most prominent filamentary section of the cosmic web and determine their
spatial extents per member cluster as the degree of their straightness. It is
found that the $f(R)$ gravity has an effect of significantly bending the
superclusters and that the effect becomes stronger as the universe evolves.
Even in the case where the deviation from GR is too small to be detectable by
any other observables, the degree of the supercluster straightness exhibits
conspicuous difference between the $f(R)$ and the GR models. Our results also
imply that the supercluster straightness could be a useful discriminator of
f(R) gravity from the coupled dark energy since it is shown to evolve
differently between the two models. As a final conclusion, the degree of the
straightness of the rich superclusters should provide a powerful cosmological
test of large scale gravity.

the early universe, the theoretical spectrum of is mainly described by an
amplitude $r$ and a spectral index $\beta$, the latter usually being determined
by the slope of the inflation potential. Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) data have
imposed constraints on the amplitude of strain spectrum for a power-law form as
a phenomenological model. Applying these constraints to a generic, theoretical
spectrum with $r$ and $\beta$ as independent parameters, we convert the PTAs
constraint into an upper bound on the index $\beta$, which turns out to be less
stringent than those upper bounds from BBN, CMB, and LIGO/VIRGO, respectively.
Moreover, it is found that PTAs constrain the non-standard RGWs more stringent
than the standard RGWs. If the condition of the quantum normalization is
imposed upon a theoretical spectrum of RGWs, $r$ and $\beta$ become related.
With this condition, a minimum requirement of the horizon size during inflation
is greater than the Planck length results in an upper bound on $\beta$, which
is comparable in magnitude to that by PTAs. When both PTAs and the quantum
normalization are applied to a theoretical spectrum of RGWs, constraints can be
obtained for other cosmic processes of the early universe, such as the
reheating, a process less understood observationally so far. The resulting
constraint is consistent with the slow-roll, massive scalar inflation model.
The future SKA will be able to constrain RGWs further and might even detect
RGWs, rendering an important probe to the very early universe.

registration algorithm with iterative closest points algorithm (ICP) aligning
obtained depth map to the estimated scene model. Aligned surface is then fused

according to the liking given user. Whereas the content based recommendation
systems tries to recommend web sites similar to those web sites the user has
liked. In the recent research we found that the efficient technique based on

web page recommendation. Major problem of the same is that the web pages are
given equal importance. Here the importance of pages changes according to the
fre-quency of visiting the web page as well as amount of time user spends on

over-come this problem, we have used the web usage log in the adaptive

$H^\pm$ is a charged Higgs boson, and $A$ is a light Higgs boson, with mass
either below or above the $b\bar{b}$ threshold. The cross-section for this

can be the dominant decay mode of the charged Higgs. The final state we
consider has two leptons and missing energy from the doubly leptonic decay of
the $W^+ W^-$ and possibly additional jets; it is therefore constrained by
existing SM Higgs searches in the $W^+ W^-$ channel. We extract these
constraints on the cross-section for this process as a function of the masses
of the particles involved. We also apply our results specifically to a type-II

the activations in these problems often tend to be localized to small groups of

mechanisms gives a general impression of diversity and throughput enhancements.
Allowing overhearing among multiple relays is also a known approach to increase
the number of participating relays in ARQs. However, when opportunistic
amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying is applied to cooperative ARQs, the system
design becomes nontrivial and even involved. Based on outage analysis, the
spatial and temporal diversities are first found sensitive to the received
signal qualities of relays, and a link quality control mechanism is then
developed to prescreen candidate relays in order to explore the diversity of
cooperative ARQs with a selective and opportunistic AF (SOAF) relaying method.
According to the analysis, the temporal and spatial diversities can be fully
exploited if proper thresholds are set for each hop along the relaying routes.
The SOAF relaying method is further examined from a packet delivery viewpoint.
By the principle of the maximum likelihood sequence detection (MLSD),
sufficient conditions on the link quality are established for the proposed
SOAF-relaying-based ARQ scheme to attain its potential diversity order in the
packet error rates (PERs) of MLSD. The conditions depend on the minimum
codeword distance and the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore,
from a heuristic viewpoint, we also develop a threshold searching algorithm for
the proposed SOAF relaying and link quality method to exploit both the
diversity and the SNR gains in PER. The effectiveness of the proposed
thresholding mechanism is verified via simulations with trellis codes.

comparisons between groups that are dissimilar. For instance, researchers
investigating the role of a prolonged duration of breastfeeding on child
outcomes may be forced to make comparisons between women with substantially
different characteristics on average. In the extreme there may exist
neighborhoods of the covariate space where there are not sufficient numbers of
both groups of women (those who breastfed for prolonged periods and those who
did not) to make inferences about those women. This is referred to as lack of
common support. Problems can arise when we try to estimate causal effects for
units that lack common support, thus we may want to avoid inference for such
units. If ignorability is satisfied with respect to a set of potential
confounders, then identifying whether, or for which units, the common support
assumption holds is an empirical question. However, in the high-dimensional
covariate space often required to satisfy ignorability such identification may
not be trivial. Existing methods used to address this problem often require
reliance on parametric assumptions and most, if not all, ignore the information
embedded in the response variable. We distinguish between the concepts of
""common support"" and common causal support."" We propose a new approach for
identifying common causal support that addresses some of the shortcomings of
existing methods. We motivate and illustrate the approach using data from the
National Longitudinal Survey of Youth to estimate the effect of breastfeeding
at least nine months on reading and math achievement scores at age five or six.
We also evaluate the comparative performance of this method in hypothetical
examples and simulations where the true treatment effect is known.

instance, the melting temperatures of light and heavy water differ by less than
4 K. Recent theoretical work has attributed this to a competition between intra
and inter molecular NQEs, which can be separated by computing the anisotropy of
the quantum kinetic energy tensor. The principal values of this tensor change
in opposite directions when ice melts, leading to a very small net quantum
mechanical effect on the melting point. This paper presents the first direct
experimental observation of this phenomenon, achieved by measuring the
deuterium momentum distributions n(p) in heavy water and ice using Deep
Inelastic Neutron Scattering (DINS), and resolving their anisotropy. Results
from the experiments, supplemented by a theoretical analysis, show that the

group of $2t$ elements, for $t$ odd, which are equivalent to $(-1,1)$-matrices
of skew type. Some explicit calculations have been done up to $t=11$. To our
knowledge, the upper bounds on the maximal determinant in orders 18 and 22 have
been improved.

We consider a special condition related to Gelfand pairs. Namely, we call a

nonmagnetic impurity in cuprate superconductors based on t-t'-J-U model. The
purpose of introducing the Coulomb repulsive interaction U is to partially
impose the double occupancy constraint by employing the Gutzwiller projected
mean-field approximation. We determine the spatial variation of the order
parameter and the local density of states (LDOS) by self-consistently solving
Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. We find that in the large U limit, a
zero-energy resonance peak in the LDOS indeed appears for the impurity
potential in the unitary limit, at the same time the asymmetric superconducting
coherence peaks are strongly suppressed. As U decreases the electron double
occupancy d is permitted and gradually increases, leading to the decreasing of
order parameter. In particular the above zero-energy resonance peak begins to
evolve into a double-peaked structure since a critical value $d_{c}$. These
important feathers are qualitatively agreement with the scanning tunneling
spectroscopy experiments, and uncover the essential role played by the electron
correlation in cuprate superconductors.

Model with right-handed (RH) sneutrinos. In this construction the RH neutrino
can be produced directly from Higgs decays or in association with a RH
sneutrino when the latter is the lightest supersymmetric particle. The RH
neutrino is generally long-lived, since its decay width is proportional to the
neutrino Yukawa, a parameter which is predicted to be small. The RH neutrino
late decay can therefore give rise to displaced vertices at the LHC, which can
be identified through the decay products, which involve two leptons (2l+ MET)
or a lepton with two jets (ljj). We simulate this signal for the current LHC
configuration (a centre of mass of 8 TeV and an integrated luminosity of L=20
fb^-1), and a future one (13 TeV and L=100 fb^-1). We show that a region of the
parameter space of this model can be probed and that the RH neutrino mass can
be reconstructed from the end-point of the two-lepton invariant mass
distribution or the central value of the mass distribution for two jets plus
one lepton. Another exotic signature of this construction is the production of
a long-lived stau. If the stau is the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle,
it can decay through diagrams involving the small neutrino Yukawa, and would
escape the detector leaving a characteristic trail. We also simulate this
signal for various benchmark points and show that the model can be within the

calculation of economic loss is the length of time they would have been in the
higher position had they been treated fairly during the period in which the
employer practiced discrimination. This problem is complicated by the fact that
one's eligibility for promotion is subject to termination by retirement and
both the promotion and retirement processes may be affected by discriminatory
practices. This semi-competing risk setup is decomposed into a retirement
process and a promotion process among the employees. Predictions for the
purpose of compensation are made by utilizing the expected promotion and
retirement probabilities of similarly qualified members of the nondiscriminated
group. The restricted mean durations of three periods are estimated - the time
an employee would be at the lower position, at the higher level and in
retirement. The asymptotic properties of the estimators are presented and
examined through simulation studies. The proposed restricted mean job duration
estimators are shown to be robust in the presence of an independent frailty
term. Data from the reverse discrimination case, Alexander v. Milwaukee, where
White-male lieutenants were discriminated in promotion to captain are
reanalyzed. While the appellate court upheld liability, it reversed the
original damage calculations, which heavily depended on the time a plaintiff

combines lasing with superconducting leads, providing a locking between the
optical phase and the superconducting phase difference between the leads. In
this work, we propose and investigate two setups derived from a superconducting
quantum interference device (SQUID), where two conventional Josephson junctions
are replaced by two HJLs. In the first setup, the HJLs share the same resonant
mode, while in the second setup two separate resonant modes of the two lasers
are coupled optically. We dub the setup `light-superconducting interference
device' (LSID).
  In both setups, we find the operating regimes similar to those of a single
HJL. Importantly, the steady lasing field is significantly affected by the
magnetic flux penetrating the SQUID loop, with respect to both amplitude and
phase. This provides opportunities to tune or even quench the lasing by varying
a small magnetic field.
  For the second setup, we find a parameter range where the evolution equation
for the laser fields supports periodic cycles. The fields are thus modulated
with the frequency of the cycle resulting in an emission spectrum consisting of
a set of discrete modes. From this spectrum, two modes dominate in the limit of
strong optical coupling. Therefore, the LSID can be also used to generate such
modulated light.

have specific Hermitian Schmidt decompositions then the matrices are separable

with the notion of weak irreducible matrix, imply that these matrices are weak
irreducible or a sum of weak irreducible matrices of the same type. The
separability problem for these types of matrices can be reduced to the set of

properties of the network are governed by robust lognormal distributions
characterising the network's connectivity and small-world properties that are

The recoil proton spectrum of Am-Be neutrons was obtained experimentally. With
the NRESP7 code, the response matrix of detector was simulated. Combining the
recoil proton spectrum and response matrix, the unfolding of neutron spectra
was performed by GRAVEL iterative algorithm. A MatLab program based on the
GRAVEL method was developed. The continuous neutron spectrum of Am-Be source
and monoenergetic neutron spectrum of D-T source have been unfolded
successfully and are in good agreement with their standard reference spectra.
The unfolded Am-Be spectrum are more accurate than the spectra unfolded by
artificial neural networks in recent years.

where $L$ grows exponentially with $n$. We first derive a general upper bound
on the list-decoding average error probability, which is suitable for both

fixed list-size regime, the bound is related to known bounds and we establish
its exponential tightness. In the exponential list-size regime, we establish
the achievability of the well known sphere packing lower bound. Relations to

paradoxical situation. Parrondo's game consists of two individual games, game A
and game B. Game A is a slightly losing coin-tossing game. Game B has two
coins, with an integer parameter $M$. If the current cumulative capital (in
discrete unit) is a multiple of $M$, an unfavorable coin $p_b$ is used,
otherwise a favorable $p_g$ coin is used. Paradoxically, combination of game A
and game B could lead to a winning game, which is the Parrondo effect. We
extend the original Parrondo's game to include the possibility of $M$ being
either $M_1$ or $M_2$. Also, we distinguish between strong Parrondo effect,
i.e. two losing games combine to form a winning game, and weak Parrondo effect,
i.e. two games combine to form a better-performing game. We find that when
$M_2$ is not a multiple of $M_1$, the combination of $B(M_1)$ and $B(M_2)$ has
strong and weak Parrondo effect for some subsets in the parameter space
$(p_b,p_g)$, while there is neither strong nor weak effect when $M_2$ is a
multiple of $M_1$. Furthermore, when $M_2$ is not a multiple of $M_1$,
stochastic mixture of game A may cancel the strong and weak Parrondo effect.
Following a discretization scheme in the literature of Parrondo's game, we
establish a link between our extended Parrondo's game with the analysis of
discrete Brownian ratchet. We find a relation between the Parrondo effect of
our extended model to the macroscopic bias in a discrete ratchet. The slope of
a ratchet potential can be mapped to the fair game condition in the extended
model, so that under some conditions, the macroscopic bias in a discrete
ratchet can provide a good predictor for the game performance of the extended
model. On the other hand, our extended model suggests a design of a ratchet in
which the potential is a mixture of two periodic potentials.

among siblings. First, we propose unordered regular expressions (UREs),
essentially regular expressions with unordered concatenation instead of
standard concatenation, that define languages of unordered words to model the
allowed content of a node (i.e., collections of the labels of children).
However, unrestricted UREs are computationally too expensive as we show the
intractability of two fundamental decision problems for UREs: membership of an
unordered word to the language of a URE and containment of two UREs.
Consequently, we propose a practical and tractable restriction of UREs,
disjunctive interval multiplicity expressions (DIMEs).
  Next, we employ DIMEs to define languages of unordered trees and propose two
schema languages: disjunctive interval multiplicity schema (DIMS), and its
restriction, disjunction-free interval multiplicity schema (IMS). We study the
complexity of the following static analysis problems: schema satisfiability,
membership of a tree to the language of a schema, schema containment, as well
as twig query satisfiability, implication, and containment in the presence of
schema. Finally, we study the expressive power of the proposed schema languages
and compare them with yardstick languages of unordered trees (FO, MSO, and
Presburger constraints) and DTDs under commutative closure. Our results show
that the proposed schema languages are capable of expressing many practical
languages of unordered trees and enjoy desirable computational properties.

example, this paper focuses on Bayesian inference of covariance (kernel)

that, compared to standard optimization of kernel parameters, they have been
systematically demonstrated to be superior in quantifying uncertainty in
predictions. Recently, the Pseudo-Marginal MCMC approach has been proposed as a
practical inference tool for GP models. In particular, it amounts in replacing
the analytically intractable marginal likelihood by an unbiased estimate
obtainable by approximate methods and importance sampling. After discussing the
potential drawbacks in employing importance sampling, this paper proposes the
application of annealed importance sampling. The results empirically
demonstrate that compared to importance sampling, annealed importance sampling
can reduce the variance of the estimate of the marginal likelihood
exponentially in the number of data at a computational cost that scales only
polynomially. The results on real data demonstrate that employing annealed
importance sampling in the Pseudo-Marginal MCMC approach represents a step
forward in the development of fully automated exact inference engines for GP

at increasing overall turnout using the example of the 2004 US presidential

introduce a modern statistical framework well suited for carrying out the main
tasks of voter targeting in a single sweep: predicting an individual's turnout
(or support) likelihood for a particular cause, party or candidate as well as
data-driven voter segmentation. Our framework, which we refer to as LORET (for
LOgistic REgression Trees), contains standard methods such as logistic
regression and classification trees as special cases and allows for a synthesis
of both techniques. For our case study, we explore various LORET models with
different regressors in the logistic model components and different
partitioning variables in the tree components; we analyze them in terms of
their predictive accuracy and compare the effect of using the full set of
available variables against using only a limited amount of information. We find
that augmenting a standard set of variables (such as age and voting history)
with additional predictor variables (such as the household composition in terms
of party affiliation) clearly improves predictive accuracy. We also find that
LORET models based on tree induction beat the unpartitioned models.
Furthermore, we illustrate how voter segmentation arises from our framework and
discuss the resulting profiles from a targeting point of view.

Furthermore, how these enzymes function on enhancers to regulate

a major mammalian H3K4 mono- and di-methyltransferase with partial functional

systems, we show that MLL4 exhibits cell-type- and

decreases H3K4me1/2, H3K27ac, Polymerase II and Mediator levels on enhancers

with an arbitrary ionic charge, that is valid for long-wavelength
high-frequency perturbations is derived using an approximate solution of a
linearized Fokker-Planck kinetic equation for electrons with a Landau collision
integral. The model accounts for both the electron-ion collisions and the
collisions of the subthermal (cold) electrons with thermal ones. The relative
contribution of the latter collisions to the dielectric function is treated
phenomenologically, introducing some parameter $\varkappa$ that is chosen in
such a way as to get a well-known expression for stationary electric
conductivity in the low-frequency region and fulfill the requirement of a
vanishing contribution of electron-electron collisions in the high-frequency
region. This procedure ensures the applicability of our model in a wide range
of plasma parameters as well as the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation.

to standardize markers relative to the nondiseased population before including

  For frequency vectors $\o_0$ having a finite uniform Diophantine exponent

then $\cT_0$ is accumulated by KAM tori of positive total measure.
  In $4$ degrees of freedom or more, we construct for any $\o_0 \in \R^d$,
$C^\infty$ (Gevrey) Hamiltonians $H$ with a smooth invariant torus $\cT_0$ with

However, instabilities that are diffusively driven towards equilibrium are
often orders of magnitude slower than the dynamics of the elastic excitations,

method to isolate the time evolution of the elastic excitations from the

beams from the perspective of the geometric phase associated with the scalar

beam carrying orbital angular momentum is a natural consequence of the skyrmion
model of a fermion. This follows from the quantization procedure of a fermion
in the framework of Nelson's stochastic mechanics when a direction vector
(vortex line) is introduced to depict the spin degrees of freedom. In this
formalism a fermion is depicted as a scalar particle encircling a vortex line.
It is here shown that when the Berry phase acquired by the scalar electron
encircling the vortex line involves quantized Dirac monopole we have paraxial
(non-paraxial) beam when the vortex line is parallel (orthogonal) to the
wavefront propagation direction. Non-paraxial beams incorporate spin-orbit
interaction. When the vortex line is tilted with respect to the propagation
direction the Berry phase involves non-quantized monopole. The temporal
variation of the direction of the tilted vortices is studied here taking into
account the renormalization group flow of the monopole charge and it is
predicted that this gives rise to spin Hall effect.

external hydrodynamic flow. The interplay between stresses arising from
membrane elasticity, hydrodynamic flows, and the ever present thermal
fluctuations leads to a rich phenomenology. In linear flows with both
rotational and elongational components, the properties of the tank-treading and
tumbling motions are now well described by theoretical and numerical models. At
the transition between these two regimes, strong shape deformations and
amplification of thermal fluctuations generate a new regime called trembling.
In this regime, the vesicle orientation oscillates quasi-periodically around
the flow direction while asymmetric deformations occur. For strong enough
flows, small-wavelength deformations like wrinkles are observed, similar to
what happens in a suddenly reversed elongational flow. In steady elongational
flow, vesicles with large excess areas deform into dumbbells at large flow
rates and pearling occurs for even stronger flows. In capillary flows with
parabolic flow profile, single vesicles migrate towards the center of the
channel, where they adopt symmetric shapes, for two reasons. First, walls exert
a hydrodynamic lift force which pushes them away. Second, shear stresses are
minimal at the tip of the flow. However, symmetry is broken for vesicles with
large excess areas, which flow off-center and deform asymmetrically. In
suspensions, hydrodynamic interactions between vesicles add up to these two
effects, making it challenging to deduce rheological properties from the
dynamics of individual vesicles. Further investigations of vesicles and similar
objects and their suspensions in steady or time-dependent flow will shed light
on phenomena such as blood flow.

magnetization dynamics in a single-domain nanomagnet is conservative in nature
and admits a specific integral of motion, which is reduced to the usual
magnetic energy when the spin current goes to zero. The existence of this
conservation law is connected to the symmetry properties of the dynamics under
simultaneous inversion of magnetisation and time. When one applies an external
magnetic field parallel to the spin polarization, the dynamics is transformed
from conservative into dissipative. More precisely, it is demonstrated that
there exists a state function such that the field induces a monotone relaxation
of this function toward its minima or maxima, depending on the field
orientation. These results hold in the absence of intrinsic damping effects.
When intrinsic damping is included in the description, a competition arises
between field-induced and damping-induced relaxations, which leads to the
appearance of limit cycles, that is, of magnetization self-oscillations.

velocity being approximately proportional to the poloidal magnetic flux,
$\Omega \propto \Psi$. This equilibrium is the long term configuration of a
magnetic field evolving because of the Hall effect and ohmic dissipation. For
an initial dipole dominated field the attractor consists mainly of a dipole and
an octupole component accompanied by an energetically negligible quadrupole
toroidal field. The field dissipates in a self-similar way: although higher
multipoles should have been decaying faster, the toroidal field mediates
transfer of energy into them from the lower ones, leading to an advection
diffusion equilibrium and keeping the ratio of the poloidal multipoles almost
constant. This has implications for the structure of the intermediate age
neutron stars, suggesting that their poloidal field should consist of a dipole
and a octupole component accompanied by a very weak toroidal quadrupole. For
initial conditions that have a higher multipole $\ell$ structure the attractor
consists mainly of $\ell$ and $\ell+2$ poloidal components.

(2005, Ls=270). Our aim was to analyse imaging and spectroscopy from multiple
different sources using a single self-consistent radiative-transfer model to
assess the magnitude of seasonal variability. Globally-averaged stratospheric
temperatures measured from methane emission tend towards a quasi-isothermal
structure (158-164 K) above the 0.1-mbar level, and are found to be consistent
with spacecraft observations of AKARI. This remarkable consistency, despite
very different observing conditions, suggests that stratospheric temporal
variability, if present, is $\pm$5 K at 1 mbar and $\pm$3 K at 0.1 mbar during
this solstice period. Conversely, ethane emission is highly variable, with
abundance determinations varying by more than a factor of two. The retrieved
C2H6 abundances are extremely sensitive to the details of the T(p) derivation.
Stratospheric temperatures and ethane are found to be latitudinally uniform
away from the south pole (assuming a latitudinally-uniform distribution of
stratospheric methane). At low and midlatitudes, comparisons of synthetic
Voyager-era images with solstice-era observations suggest that tropospheric
zonal temperatures are unchanged since the Voyager 2 encounter, with cool
mid-latitudes and a warm equator and pole. A re-analysis of Voyager/IRIS 25-50
{\mu}m mapping of tropospheric temperatures and para-hydrogen disequilibrium
suggests a symmetric meridional circulation with cold air rising at
mid-latitudes (sub-equilibrium para-H2 conditions) and warm air sinking at the
equator and poles (super-equilibrium para-H2 conditions). The most significant
atmospheric changes are associated with the polar vortex (absent in 1989).

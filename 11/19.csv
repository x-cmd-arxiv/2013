  Molecular Communications",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT q-bio.MN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Molecular communication emerges as a promising communication paradigm for
nanotechnology. However, solid mathematical foundations for
information-theoretic analysis of molecular communication have not yet been
built. In particular, no one has ever proven that the channel coding theorem
applies for molecular communication, and no relationship between information
rate capacity (maximum mutual information) and code rate capacity (supremum
achievable code rate) has been established. In this paper, we focus on a major
subclass of molecular communication - the diffusion-based molecular
communication. We provide solid mathematical foundations for information theory
in diffusion-based molecular communication by creating a general
diffusion-based molecular channel model in measure-theoretic form and prove its
channel coding theorems. Various equivalence relationships between statistical
and operational definitions of channel capacity are also established, including
the most classic information rate capacity and code rate capacity. As
byproducts, we have shown that the diffusion-based molecular channel is with
""asymptotically decreasing input memory and anticipation"" and ""d-continuous"".
Other properties of diffusion-based molecular channel such as stationarity or
ergodicity are also proven.

collision point. if the collision point is inside the Roche lobe of the planet,
the envelopes have the almost spherical shapes of classical atmospheres,
slightly distorted by the influence of the star and interactions with the
stellar-wind gas; if the collision point is located outside the Roche lobe,
outflows from the vicinity of the Lagrangian points $\mathrm L_1$ and $\mathrm
L_2$ arise, and the envelope becomes substantially asymmetrical. The latter
class of objects can also be divided into two types. If the dynamical pressure
of the stellar-wind gas is high enough to stop the most powerful outflow from
the vicinity of the inner Lagrangian point $\mathrm L_1$, a closed
quasi-spherical envelope with a complex shape forms in the system. If the wind
is unable to stop the outflow from $\mathrm L_1$, an open aspherical envelope
forms. The possible existence of atmospheres of these three types is confirmed
by 3D numerical modeling. Using the typical ""hot Jupiter"" HD 209458b as an
example, it is shown that all three types of atmospheres could exist within the
range of estimated parameters of this planet. Since different types of
envelopes have different observational manifestations, determining the type of
envelope in HD 209458b could apply additional constrains on the parameters of

neutron star binaries, with astrophysically realistic spins aligned and
anti-aligned to the orbital angular momentum. The initial data is computed with
the constant rotational velocity approach. The dynamics of the systems is
analyzed in terms of gauge-invariant binding energy vs. orbital angular

estimate the different tidal and spin contributions to the binding energy for

The phase evolution during the orbital motion is significantly affected by
spin-orbit interactions, leading to delayed or early mergers. Furthermore, a

too high. In the present work these processes are studied in the case of
several leptoquarks which may appear in many beyond Standard Model theories. It
is found that the constraints on the portal couplings from the single Higgs
production and the decays to various channels measured by the LHC experiments
still allow increased Higgs pair production rate. For the masses in the range

the Higgs pair production may reach an order to several hundred in magnitude
larger rate than the Standard Model case for the 8 TeV run. Therefore, combined

vector-like quarks. Mixing effects between the Standard Model fields and the
heavy states, which can be quite large in case of the top quark, imply
deviations from the SM. In this work we investigate the possibility of heavy
bottom partners. We show that they can have a significant impact on electroweak
precision observables and the current Higgs results if there is a sizeable
mixing with the bottom quark. We explicitly check that the constraints from the
measurement of the CKM matrix element $V_{tb}$ are fulfilled, and we test the
compatibility with the electroweak precision observables. In particular we
evaluate the constraint from the $Z$ coupling to left-handed bottom quarks.
General formulae have been derived which include the effects of new bottom
partners in the loop corrections to this coupling and which can be applied to
other models with similar particle content. Furthermore, the constraints from
direct searches for heavy states at the LHC and from the Higgs search results
have been included in our analysis. The best agreement with all the considered
constraints is achieved for medium to large compositeness of the left-handed
top and bottom quarks.

is driven by rules of tournament selection. A system can be conceived as an
evolving tree with a new node being attached to a contestant node at the best
hierarchy level (a level nearest to the tree root). The proposed evolution
reflects limited information on system properties available to new nodes. It
can also be expressed in terms of population dynamics. Two models are
considered: a constant tournament (CT) model wherein the number of tournament
participants is constant throughout system evolution, and a proportional
tournament (PT) model where this number increases proportionally to the growing
size of the system itself. The results of analytical calculations based on a
rate equation fit well to numerical simulations for both models. In the CT
model all hierarchy levels emerge but the birth time of a consecutive hierarchy
level increases exponentially or faster for each new level. The number of nodes
at the first hierarchy level grows logarithmically in time, while the size of
the last, ""worst"" hierarchy level oscillates quasi log-periodically. In the PT
model the occupations of the first two hierarchy levels increase linearly but
worse hierarchy levels either do not emerge at all or appear only by chance in
early stage of system evolution to further stop growing at all. The results
allow to conclude that information available to each new node in tournament
dynamics restrains the emergence of new hierarchy levels and that it is the
absolute amount of information, not relative, which governs such behavior.

the X-ray emission from DN Tau is dominated by coronal plasma generated via
magnetic activity, but also clearly detect a contribution of the accretion
shocks to the cool plasma component at about 2 MK as consistently inferred from
density and temperature analysis. Typical phenomena of active coronae like
flaring, the presence of very hot plasma at 30 MK and an abundance pattern
showing the inverse FIP effect are seen on DN Tau. Strong variations in the
emission measure of the cooler plasma components between the 2005 and 2010 XMM
data point to accretion related changes. The UV light curve taken
simultaneously is in general not related to the X-ray brightness, but exhibits
clear counterparts during the observed X-ray flares. The X-ray properties of DN
Tau are similar to those of more massive CTTS, but its low mass and large
radius shift the accretion shocks to lower temperatures, reducing their imprint
in the X-ray regime.

populations and thereby potentially their genetic diversity is the Allee
effect, a reduction in population growth rates at small population sizes. We
take a stochastic modeling approach to investigate levels of genetic diversity
in populations that successfully overcame a strong demographic Allee effect, a
scenario in which populations smaller than a certain critical size are expected
to decline. Our results indicate that compared to successful populations
without Allee effect, successful Allee-effect populations tend to 1) derive
from larger founder population sizes and thus have a higher initial amount of
genetic variation, 2) spend fewer generations at small population sizes where
genetic drift is particularly strong, and 3) spend more time around the
critical population size and thus experience more drift there. Altogether, the
Allee effect can either increase or decrease genetic diversity, depending on
the average founder population size. In the case of multiple introduction
events, there is an additional increase in diversity because Allee-effect
populations tend to derive from a larger number of introduction events than
other populations. Finally, we show that given genetic data from sufficiently
many populations, we can statistically infer the critical population size.

gauge field $A^{ab}_{\phantom{ab}\mu}$ and a symmetry breaking Higgs field
$V^{a}$, with no metric or affine structure of spacetime presupposed. However,
these structures can be recovered, with the predictions of General Relativity
exactly reproduced, whenever the Higgs field breaking the symmetry to $SO(1,3)$
is forced to have a constant (positive) norm $V^aV_a$. This restriction is
usually imposed ""by hand"", but in analogy with the electroweak theory we
promote the gravitational Higgs field $V^a$ to a genuine dynamical field,
subject to non-trivial equations of motion. Even though we limit ourselves to
actions polynomial in these variables, we discover a rich phenomenology. Most
notably we derive classical cosmological solutions exhibiting a smooth
transition between Euclidean and Lorentzian signature in the four-metric. These
solutions are non-singular and arise whenever the $SO(1,4)$ norm of the Higgs
field changes sign i.e. the signature of the metric of spacetime is determined
dynamically by the gravitational Higgs field. It is possible to find a plethora
of such solutions and in some of them this dramatic behaviour is confined to
the early universe, with the theory asymptotically tending to Einstein gravity
at late times. Curiously the theory can also naturally embody a well-known dark

results from the discrepancy between the training and test distributions. An
effective approach which recently drew a considerable attention in the research
community is to reweight the training samples to minimize that discrepancy. In
specific, many methods are based on developing Density-ratio (DR) estimation
techniques that apply to both regression and classification problems. Although
these methods work well for regression problems, their performance on
classification problems is not satisfactory. This is due to a key observation
that these methods focus on matching the sample marginal distributions without
paying attention to preserving the separation between classes in the reweighted
space. In this paper, we propose a novel method for Discriminative
Density-ratio (DDR) estimation that addresses the aforementioned problem and
aims at estimating the density-ratio of joint distributions in a class-wise
manner. The proposed algorithm is an iterative procedure that alternates
between estimating the class information for the test data and estimating new
density ratio for each class. To incorporate the estimated class information of
the test data, a soft matching technique is proposed. In addition, we employ an
effective criterion which adopts mutual information as an indicator to stop the
iterative procedure while resulting in a decision boundary that lies in a
sparse region. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method in terms of both accuracy and robustness.

Einstein's equations of general relativity. The main result of this work is the
proof that the energy of the Einstein-equivariant wave map system does not
concentrate during the Cauchy evolution. A key ingredient in the proof is the
use of the fact that geometric mass at infinity of the Einstein-equivariant
wave map system is conserved during the evolution. However, this observation
has some subtle local implications which have been used to estimate the energy
locally. For instance, we construct a divergence-free vector field which gives
monotonicity of energy in the past null cone of any point. In addition, this
vector has also been used to prove that the energy does not concentrate away
from the axis of the domain manifold. Later, estimating the divergence of a
Morawetz vector on a truncated past null cone, we prove that the kinetic energy
does not concentrate. Finally, assuming that the target manifold satisfies the
Grillakis condition, we proceed to prove the non-concentration of energy for
the critical Einstein-equivariant wave map system. Keeping track of various
quantities of wave map relative to the evolving null geometry of the background
manifold is a recurring theme throughout the course of this work.
  Apart from a purely mathematical interest, the motivation to study critical
self-gravitating wave maps is that they occur naturally in 3+1 Einstein's
equations of general relativity. Therefore, studying critical self-gravitating
wave maps could be a fruitful way of understanding the ever elusive global
behaviour of Einstein's equations. This work is a step in this endeavour.

principle. In this work, we reveal that the angles in the LUT have definite
physical meaning, and demonstrate the exact connection of the LUT to neutrino
oscillations. For the first time, we prove that these leptonic angles act as
phase shifts in neutrino oscillations, by shifting \Delta m^{2}L/2E to \Delta
m^{2}L/2E + \alpha, where (L, E, \alpha) denote the baseline length, neutrino
energy and corresponding angle of the LUT. Each LUT has three independent
parameters and contains only partial information of the PMNS matrix. We
demonstrate that the partial information in each LUT can describe the
corresponding neutrino oscillation. Hence, for the first time, we uncover that
any given kind of neutrino oscillations contain at most three (rather than
four) independent degrees of freedom from the PMNS matrix. This may provide a
cleaner way for fitting the corresponding oscillation data.

into the fluid medium. For active particles immersed in liquids, fluid-mediated
viscous stresses can play an important role on the emergence of collective

self-assembling magnetically-driven colloidal particles which can rapidly form
organized hexagonal structures. We find that viscous stresses reduce hexagonal
ordering, generate smaller clusters, and significantly decrease the rate of
cluster formation, all while holding the system at constant number density.
Furthermore, we show that time and length scales of cluster formation depend on
the Mason number (Mn), or ratio of viscous to magnetic forces, scaling as t /

collective behavior in a self-assembling colloidal system.

establish the Symplectic Hecke Correspondence for a wide class of the monodromy

Bernoulli Shift model, using a parametric set of predictors. The aggregation
technique provides a predictor with well established and quite satisfying
theoretical properties expressed by an oracle inequality for the prediction
risk. The numerical computation of the aggregated predictor usually relies on a
Markov chain Monte Carlo method whose convergence should be evaluated. In
particular, it is crucial to bound the number of simulations needed to achieve
a numerical precision of the same order as the prediction risk. In this
direction we present a fairly general result which can be seen as an oracle
inequality including the numerical cost of the predictor computation. The
numerical cost appears by letting the oracle inequality depend on the number of
simulations required in the Monte Carlo approximation. Some numerical
experiments are then carried out to support our findings.

Yet, the effects of crowding on the dynamics of signaling pathways, gene
regulation networks and metabolic networks are still largely unknown. Crowding
can alter both molecular diffusion and the equilibria of biomolecular
reactions. In this review, we first discuss how diffusion can affect
biochemical networks. Diffusion of transcription factors can increase noise in
gene expression, while diffusion of proteins between intracellular compartments
or between cells can reduce concentration fluctuations. In push-pull networks
diffusion can impede information transmission, while in multi-site protein
modification networks diffusion can qualitatively change the macroscopic
response of the system, such as the loss or emergence of bistability. Moreover,
diffusion can directly change the metabolic flux. We describe how crowding
affects diffusion, and thus how all these phenomena are influenced by crowding.
Yet, a potentially more important effect of crowding on biochemical networks is
mediated via the shift in the equilibria of bimolecular reactions, and we
provide computational evidence that supports this idea. Finally, we discuss how
the effects of crowding can be incorporated in models of biochemical networks.

scientific and industrial applications. Typically, projection slice theorem
enables multiple two-dimensional (2D) projections of an object to be combined
in the Fourier domain to yield a 3D image. However, traditional techniques
require a significant number of projections. The significant number of views
required in conventional tomography not only complicates such imaging
modalities, but also limits their ability to image samples that are sensitive
to radiation dose or are otherwise unstable in time. In this work, we
demonstrate through numerical simulations and an eigenvalue analysis that a
recently developed technique called ankylography enables 3D image
reconstruction using much fewer views than conventional tomography. Such a

the present note, we compute the probe action in the one matrix model with a
quartic potential. This allows to illustrate several non-trivial aspects of the
construction in an exactly solvable set-up. One of our main goal is to test the
bare bubble approximation. The approximate free energy found in this
approximation, which can be derived from a back-of-an-envelope calculation,
matches the exact result for all values of the 't Hooft coupling with a
surprising accuracy. Another goal is to illustrate the remarkable properties of
the equivariant partial gauge-fixing procedure, which is at the heart of the
formalism. For this we use a general xi-gauge to compute the brane action. The
action depends on xi in a very non-trivial way, yet we show explicitly that its
critical value does not and coincide with twice the free energy, as required by
general consistency. This is made possible by a phenomenon of ghost
condensation and the spontaneous breaking of the equivariant BRST symmetry.

strings in flat spacetime has been proposed by Thorn as a candidate to resolve
non-perturbative issues of gauge theories in the large $N$ limit. With $SU (N)$
Chan-Paton factors, the sum over planar open string multi-loop diagrams
describes the 't Hooft limit $N\to \infty$ with $Ng_s^2$ held fixed. By
including only planar diagrams in the sum the usual mechanism for the
cancellation of loop divergences (which occurs, for example, among the planar
and M\""obius strip diagrams by choosing a specific gauge group) is not
available and a renormalization procedure is needed. In this article the
renormalization is achieved by suspending total momentum conservation by an
amount $p\equiv \sum_i^n k_i\neq 0$ at the level of the integrands in the
integrals over the moduli and analytically continuing them to $p=0$ at the very
end. This procedure has been successfully tested for the 2 and 3 gluon planar
loop amplitudes by Thorn. Gauge invariance is respected and the correct running
of the coupling in the limiting gauge field theory was also correctly obtained.

giving full details for the 4-point case. One of our main results is to provide
a fully renormalized amplitude which is free of both UV and the usual spurious
divergences leaving only the physical singularities in it. Second, using the
complete renormalized amplitude, we extract the high-energy scattering regime
at fixed angle (tensionless limit). Apart from obtaining the usual exponential
falloff at high energies, we compute the full dependence on the scattering
angle which shows the existence of a smooth connection between the Regge and
hard scattering regimes.

formed as a highly substructured, unbound association with a low volume density

string theory and holographic field theory to extract universal ideas and
structural features that we expect to be important in resolving the information
problem and understanding the microstate structure of Schwarzschild and Kerr
black holes. In particular, we emphasize two conceptually and physically
distinct ideas, with different underlying energy scales: a) the transition that
supports the microstate structure and prevents the formation of a horizon and
b) the representation of the detailed microstate structure itself in terms of
fluctuations around the transitioned state. We also show that the supergravity
mechanism that supports microstate geometries becomes, in the string theory
limit, either brane polarization or the excitation of non-Abelian degrees of
freedom. We thus argue that if any mechanism for supporting structure at the
horizon scale is to be given substance within string theory then it must be
some manifestation of microstate geometries.

between the conduction bands and local magnetic moments originating from charge
traps at the interface. Tuning the itinerant electron density in the model
drives transitions between a heavy Fermi liquid phase with screened moments and
various magnetic states. The dependence of the magnetic phenomena on the
electron density or gate voltage stems from competing magnetic interactions
between the local moments and the different conduction bands. At low densities
only the lowest conduction band, composed of the $d_{xy}$ orbitals of Ti, is
occupied. Its antiferromagnetic interaction with the local moments leads to
screening of the moments at a Kondo scale that increases with density. However,
above a critical density, measured in experiments to be $n_c\approx 1.7\times
10^{13} cm^{-2}$, the $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ bands begin to populate. Their
ferromagnetic interaction with the local moments competes with the
antiferromagnetic interaction of the $d_{xy}$ band leading to eventual
reduction of the Kondo scale with density. We explain the distinct magneto
transport regimes seen in experiments as manifestations of the magnetic phase
diagram computed from the model. We present new data showing a relation between
the anomalous Hall effect and the resistivity in the system. The data strongly
suggests that the concentration of local magnetic moments affecting the
transport in the system is much lower than the carrier density, in accord with

galaxy's large scale environment can affect its ULX content. Using the AMUSE
survey, which includes homogeneous X-ray coverage of 100 elliptical galaxies in
the Virgo cluster and a similar number of elliptical galaxies in the field
(spanning stellar masses of 1e8-1e12 M_sun), we identify 37.9 +/- 10.1 ULXs in
Virgo and 28.1 +/- 8.7 ULXs in the field. Across both samples, we constrain the
number of ULXs per unit stellar mass, i.e., the ULX specific frequency, to be
0.062 +/- 0.013 ULXs per 10^10 M_sun (or about 1 ULX per 1.6e11 M_sun of galaxy
stellar mass). We find that the number of ULXs, the specific frequency of ULXs,
and the average ULX spectral properties are all similar in both cluster and
field environments. Contrary to late-type galaxies, we do not see any trend
between specific ULX frequency and host galaxy stellar mass, and we show that
dwarf ellipticals host fewer ULXs than later-type dwarf galaxies at a
statistically meaningful level. Our results are consistent with ULXs in
early-type galaxies probing the luminous tail of the low-mass X-ray binary

calculations, like the posterior expected mutual information or posterior
expected multi-information. We also use computer experiments to favorably

computing distances and orbital parameters for this sample, we employ a number
of useful subsets to formulate constraints on Galactic chemical and
chemodynamical evolution processes in the Solar neighbourhood and beyond (e.g.,
metallicity distributions -- MDFs, [$\alpha$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] diagrams, and
abundance gradients). Our red giant sample spans distances as large as 10 kpc
from the Sun.
  We find remarkable agreement between the recently published local (d $<$ 100
pc) high-resolution high-S/N HARPS sample and our local HQ sample (d $<$ 1
kpc). The local MDF peaks slightly below solar metallicity, and exhibits an
extended tail towards [Fe/H] $= -$1, whereas a sharper cut-off is seen at
larger metallicities. The APOGEE data also confirm the existence of a gap in
the [$\alpha$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] abundance diagram. When expanding our sample to
cover three different Galactocentric distance bins, we find the
high-[$\alpha$/Fe] stars to be rare towards the outer zones, as previously
suggested in the literature. For the gradients in [Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe],
measured over a range of 6 $ < $ R $ <$ 11 kpc in Galactocentric distance, we
find a good agreement with the gradients traced by the GCS and RAVE dwarf

builds on variance estimates for bagging proposed by Efron (1992, 2012) that

bagged predictors are computed using a finite number B of bootstrap replicates,
and working with a large B can be computationally expensive. Direct
applications of jackknife and IJ estimators to bagging require B on the order
of n^{1.5} bootstrap replicates to converge, where n is the size of the

n replicates. Moreover, we show that the IJ estimator requires 1.7 times less

we study the sampling distributions of the jackknife and IJ variance estimates

V(R_d)/R_d than dwarf irregulars, suggesting that the starburst is closely
related to the inner shape of the potential well. There are, however, some
""compact"" irregulars with values of V(R_d)/R_d similar to BCDs. Unless a
redistribution of mass takes place, BCDs must evolve into compact irregulars.
Rotating spheroidals in the Virgo cluster follow the same correlation between
V(R_d)/R_d and mu(0) as gas-rich dwarfs. They have values of V(R_d)/R_d
comparable to those of BCDs and compact irregulars, pointing at evolutionary
links between these types of dwarfs. Finally, we find that, similarly to spiral
galaxies and massive starbursts, the star-formation activity in dwarfs can be
parametrized as Sigma_SFR = epsilon*Sigma_gas/t_orb, where t_orb is the orbital

organisations to assess the items in this repository to help users find

non-peers from a variety of different perspectives: user reviews, statistical

between GRBs, supernovae and stellar evolution. Additionally, the GRB rate at
high redshift provides a strong probe of star formation history in the early
universe. While hundreds of GRBs are observed by Swift, it remains difficult to
determine the intrinsic GRB rate due to the complex trigger algorithm of Swift.
Current studies of the GRB rate usually approximate the Swift trigger algorithm
by a single detection threshold. However, unlike the previously flown GRB
instruments, Swift has over 500 trigger criteria based on photon count rate and
additional image threshold for localization. To investigate possible systematic
biases and explore the intrinsic GRB properties, we develop a program that is
capable of simulating all the rate trigger criteria and mimicking the image
threshold. Our simulations show that adopting the complex trigger algorithm of
Swift increases the detection rate of dim bursts. As a result, our simulations
suggest bursts need to be dimmer than previously expected to avoid
over-producing the number of detections and to match with Swift observations.
Moreover, our results indicate that these dim bursts are more likely to be high
redshift events than low-luminosity GRBs. This would imply an even higher
cosmic GRB rate at large redshifts than previous expectations based on
star-formation rate measurements, unless other factors, such as the luminosity
evolution, are taken into account. The GRB rate from our best result gives a
total number of 4571^{+829}_{-1584} GRBs per year that are beamed toward us in
the whole universe.

approximating the distribution of the complex phase of the fermion determinant

We calculate the distribution of the complex phase from the hadron resonance

the case of the hadron resonance gas model the distribution takes a Gaussian
form, but from the strong coupling and hopping expansion there are corrections.

Galaxy; however, the gradient appears to flatten for R < 6 kpc, in particular
near the Galactic mid-plane and for low-[{\alpha}/M] stars. At R > 6 kpc, the
gradient flattens as one moves off of the plane, and is flatter at all heights

these gradients can be described as vertical gradients that flatten at larger

flatter radial gradient than stars with lower [{\alpha}/M]. This could suggest
that the metallicity gradient has grown steeper with time or, alternatively,
that gradients are washed out over time by migration of stars.

which are discussed mainly considering the more commonly adopted formulations.
Different approaches that have been used to investigate the material flow are

modeling depends on the fine tuning of some process and material parameters.
Usually, these parameters are achieved with base on experimental data. The

exploiting strong emission line diagnostics. We found that a significant
fraction of star-forming galaxies at z~3.4 deviate from the Fundamental
Metallicity Relation (FMR), with a metallicity up to a factor of ten lower than
expected according to the FMR. This deviation does not correlate with the
dynamical properties of the galaxy or with the presence of interactions. To
investigate the origin of the metallicity deviations in more detail, we also
infer information on the gas content, by inverting the Schmidt-Kennicutt
relation. In agreement with recent CO observational data, we found that, in
contrast with the steeply rising trend at 0<z<2, the gas fraction in massive
galaxies remains constant, with indication of a marginal decline, at 2<z<3.5.
When combined with the metallicity information, we infer that to explain both
the low metallicity and gas content in z~3.4 galaxies, both prominent outflows
and massive pristine gas inflows are needed. In ten galaxies we can also
spatially resolve the metallicity distribution. We found that the metallicity
generally anticorrelates with the distribution of star formation and with the
gas surface density. We discuss these findings in terms of pristine gas inflows
towards the center, and outflows of metal rich gas from the center toward the
external regions. (Abridged)

Stellar clusters in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) are useful
probes for studying the chemical and dynamical evolution of this neighbouring
dwarf galaxy, enabling inspection of a large period covering over 10 Gyr. Aims:
The main goals of this work are the derivation of age, metallicity, distance
modulus, reddening, core radius, and central density profiles for six sample
clusters, in order to place them in the context of the Small Cloud evolution.
The studied clusters are AM 3, HW 1, HW 34, HW 40, Lindsay 2, and Lindsay 3; HW
1, HW 34, and Lindsay 2 are studied for the first time. Methods: Optical
colour-magnitude diagrams (V,B - V CMDs) and radial density profiles were built
from images obtained with the 4.1 m Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR)
telescope, reaching V ~ 23. The determination of structural parameters were
carried out by applying King profile fitting. The other parameters were derived
in a self-consistent way by means of isochrone fitting, which uses likelihood
statistics to identify the synthetic CMDs that best reproduce the observed
ones. Membership probabilities were determined comparing the cluster and
control field CMDs. Completeness and photometric uncertainties were obtained by
performing artificial star tests. Results: The results confirm that these
clusters (except HW 34, identified as a field fluctuation) are intermediate-age
clusters, with ages between 1.2 Gyr (Lindsay 3) and ~5.0 Gyr (HW 1). In
particular HW 1, Lindsay 2 and Lindsay 3 are located in a region that we called
West Halo, where studies of ages and metallicity gradients are still lacking.
Moreover, Lindsay 2 was identified as a moderately metal-poor cluster with
[Fe/H] = -1.4 +/- 0.2 dex, lower than expected from the age-metallicity
relation by Pagel & Tautvaisiene (1998). We also found distances varying from
~53 kpc to 66 kpc, compatible with the large depth of the SMC.

theoretic key exchange protocols that rely on the physical characteristics of
the communication channel to enable the computation of a shared key by two (or
more) parties that share no prior secret information. The key is supposed to be
information theoretically hidden to an eavesdropper. Despite the recent surge
of research activity in the area, concrete claims about the security of the
protocols typically rely on channel abstractions that are not fully
experimentally substantiated. In this work, we propose a novel methodology for
the {\em experimental} security analysis of these protocols. The crux of our
methodology is a falsifiable channel abstraction that is accompanied by an
efficient experimental approximation algorithm of the {\em conditional
min-entropy} available to the two parties given the view of the eavesdropper.
  We focus on the signal strength between two wirelessly communicating
transceivers as the measured quantity and we use an experimental setup to
compute the conditional min-entropy of the channel given the view of the
attacker which we find to be linearly increasing. Armed with this understanding
of the channel, we showcase the methodology by providing a general protocol for
key extraction in this setting that is shown to be secure for a concrete
parameter selection. In this way we provide a first comprehensively analyzed
wireless key extraction protocol that is demonstrably secure against passive
adversaries. Our methodology uses hidden Markov models as the channel model and
a dynamic programming approach to approximate conditional min-entropy but other
possible instantiations of the methodology can be motivated by our work.

completely integrable systems - systems that are known to attain equilibrium.
Ergodic systems are known to thermal equilibrate with a Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution and we show a simple derivation of this distribution that also
leads to a derivation of the distribution at any time t. For illustrative
purposes, we apply the method to the problem of a one-dimensional gravitational
gas even though its ergodicity is debatable. For completely integrable systems,
the Liouville equation in the original phase space is rather involved because
of the group structure of the integral invariants, which hints of a gauge
symmetry. We use Dirac's constrained formalism to show the change in the
Liouville equation, which necessitates the introduction of gauge-fixing
conditions. We then show that the solution of the Liouville equation is
independent of the choice of gauge, which it must be because physical
quantities are derived from the distribution. Instead, we derive the solution
to the classical Liouville equation in the phase space where the dynamics
involve ignorable coordinates, a technique that is akin to the use of the
unitarity gauge in spontaneously broken gauge theories to expose the physical
degrees of freedom. It turns out the distribution is time-independent and

under tensile/compressive remote biaxial transverse loads is studied by a new
linear elastic - (perfectly) brittle interface model. In this model the
interface is represented by a continuous distribution of springs which
simulates the presence of a thin elastic layer. The constitutive law for the
continuous distribution of normal and tangential of initially linear elastic
springs takes into account possible frictionless elastic contact between fibre
and matrix once a portion of the interface is broken. A brittle failure
criterion is employed for the distribution of springs, which enables the study
of crack onset and propagation. This interface failure criterion takes into
account the variation of the interface fracture toughness with the fracture
mode mixity. The main advantages of the present interface model are its
simplicity, robustness and its computational efficiency when the so-called
sequentially linear analysis is applied. Moreover, in the present plane strain
problem of a single fibre embedded in a matrix subjected to uniform remote
transverse loads, this model can be used to obtain analytic predictions of
interface crack onset. The numerical results provided by a 2D boundary element
analysis show that a fibre-matrix interface failure initiates by onset of a
finite debond in the neighbourhood of an interface point where the failure
criterion is reached first (under increasing proportional load), this debond
further propagating along the interface in mixed mode or even, in some
configurations, with the crack tip under compression. The analytical
predictions of the debond onset position and associated critical load are used
for checking the computational procedure implemented, an excellent agreement
being obtained.

far field, by using Monte Carlo simulation in this work. The results indicate
that the MPB collimator may maintain the same system characteristics as

MPB is more 3.7% than the PB with high sensitivity (HSPB), the improved

reconstruction process also indicates that the convergence rate of MPB is
slower than the HSPB because the projection counts are part of overlapping and
the PSF of oblique PB (OPB) is asymmetrical. However the effective hole length

per bunch for various operations and accelerator physics studies. High
performance operations of the FEL and gamma-ray source require a stable
electron beam orbit, which has been realized by the global orbit feedback
system. As a critical part of the orbit feedback system, the electron beam
position monitors (BPMs) are required to be able to precisely measure the
electron beam orbit in a wide range of the single-bunch current. However, the
high peak voltage of the BPM pickups associated with high single-bunch current
degrades the performance of the BPM electronics, and can potentially damage the
BPM electronics. A signal conditioning method using low pass filters is
developed to reduce the peak voltage to protect the BPM electronics, and to
make the BPMs capable of working with a wide range of single-bunch current.
Simulations and electron beam based tests are performed. The results show that
the Duke storage ring BPM system is capable of providing precise orbit
measurements to ensure highly stable FEL and HIGS operations.

when it is legal to call particular methods with particular arguments. For
example, one cannot use an iterator over a set once the set has been changed
directly or through another iterator. We formalize the notion of dynamic
package interfaces (DPI), which generalize state-machine interfaces for single
objects, and give an algorithm to statically compute a sound abstraction of a
DPI. States of a DPI represent (unbounded) sets of heap configurations and
edges represent the effects of method calls on the heap. We introduce a novel
heap abstract domain based on depth-bounded systems to deal with potentially
unboundedly many objects and the references among them. We have implemented our

critical for describing the degree of uncertainty in the estimates. This work
is based upon optimal binning techniques that we have developed for
piecewise-constant, histogram-style models of the underlying density functions.
Two useful side benefits have already been discovered. The first allows a
researcher to determine whether there exist sufficient data to estimate the
underlying probability density. The second permits one to determine an
acceptable degree of round-off when compressing data for efficient transfer and
storage. We also demonstrate how mutual information and transfer entropy can be
applied so as to allow researchers not only to identify relations among climate

sensitive to surrounding medium optical index changes and thus appealing for
sensing applications. A figure of merit (FoM) of such a system (gold/graphene/

compositeness, which corresponds to the amount of two-body states composing
resonances as well as bound states. For a $\bar{K}N (I=0)$ bound state without
couplings to other channels, we establish a relation between the radiative
decay width and the compositeness. Especially the radiative decay width of the
bound state is proportional to the compositeness. Applying the formulation to
$\Lambda (1405)$, we observe that the decay to $\Lambda \gamma$ is dominated by
the $K^{-}p$ component inside $\Lambda (1405)$, because in this decay $\pi ^{+}
\Sigma ^{-}$ and $\pi ^{-} \Sigma ^{+}$ strongly cancel each other and the $\pi
\Sigma$ component can contribute to the $\Lambda \gamma$ decay only through the
slight isospin breaking. This means that the decay $\Lambda (1405) \to \Lambda
\gamma$ is suitable for the study of the $\bar{K} N$ component in $\Lambda
(1405)$. Fixing the $\Lambda (1405)$-$\pi \Sigma$ coupling constant from the
usual decay of $\Lambda (1405) \to \pi \Sigma$, we show a relation between the
absolute value of the $\bar{K} N$ compositeness for $\Lambda (1405)$ and the
radiative decay width of $\Lambda (1405) \to \Lambda \gamma$ and $\Sigma ^{0}
\gamma$, and we find that large decay width to $\Lambda \gamma$ implies large
$\bar{K}N$ compositeness for $\Lambda (1405)$. By using the ""experimental"" data
on the radiative decay widths, which is based on an isobar model fitting of the
$K^{-}p$ atom data, we estimate the $\bar{K}N$ compositeness for $\Lambda

fields in AI. Nonmonotonic logic programming (NMLP) and Answer Set Programming
(ASP) provide formal languages for representing and reasoning with commonsense
knowledge and realize declarative problem solving in AI. On the other side,
Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) realizes Machine Learning in logic
programming, which provides a formal background to inductive learning and the
techniques have been applied to the fields of relational learning and data
mining. Generally speaking, NMLP and ASP realize nonmonotonic reasoning while
lack the ability of learning. By contrast, ILP realizes inductive learning
while most techniques have been developed under the classical monotonic logic.
With this background, some researchers attempt to combine techniques in the
context of nonmonotonic ILP. Such combination will introduce a learning
mechanism to programs and would exploit new applications on the NMLP side,
while on the ILP side it will extend the representation language and enable us
to use existing solvers. Cross-fertilization between learning and nonmonotonic
reasoning can also occur in such as the use of answer set solvers for ILP,
speed-up learning while running answer set solvers, learning action theories,
learning transition rules in dynamical systems, abductive learning, learning
biological networks with inhibition, and applications involving default and
negation. This workshop is the first attempt to provide an open forum for the
identification of problems and discussion of possible collaborations among

contribution of low-lying Dirac modes to the Polyakov loop at the quenched

Dirac-mode contribution from the QCD vacuum generated by lattice QCD in both
confinement and deconfinement phases. Thus, we conclude that there is no
one-to-one correspondence between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in

method for spin-diagonalizing the Dirac operator on the temporally odd-number

quantitative models and methods. The semantic information in web documents and

misunderstanding so that the results are either unreliable or inconsistent. A
new qualitative approach is thus proposed for supporting geographic information
retrieval based on qualitative representation, semantic matching, and
qualitative reasoning. A qualitative representation model and the corresponding
similarity measurement method are defined. Information in documents and user
queries are represented using propositional logic, which considers the thematic
and geographic semantics synthetically. Thematic information is represented as
thematic propositions on the base of domain ontology. Similarly, spatial
information is represented as geo-spatial propositions with the support of
geographic knowledge base. Then the similarity is divided into thematic
similarity and spatial similarity. The former is calculated by the weighted
distance of proposition keywords in the domain ontology, and the latter
similarity is further divided into conceptual similarity and spatial
similarity. Represented by propositions and information units, the similarity
measurement can take evidence theory and fuzzy logic to combine all sub
similarities to get the final similarity between documents and queries. This
novel retrieval method is mainly used to retrieve the qualitative geographic
information to support the semantic matching and results ranking. It does not
deal with geometric computation and is consistent with human commonsense
cognition, and thus can improve the efficiency of geographic information

$\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ invariants and the Rashba energy can be controlled by
engineering the layer geometries of the heterostructure, and the Rashba energy
can be made even larger than that of bulk BiTeI. Our work opens a new route for

systems of boson gas within the harmonic oscillator potentials with anisotropic
frequencies in transverse and longitudinal directions. The HBT chaotic
parameter, which can be obtained by measuring the correlation functions at zero
relative momentum of the particle pair, is related to the degree of
Bose-Einstein condensation and thus the system environment. We investigate the
effects of system temperature, particle number, and the average momentum of the
particle pair on the chaotic parameter. The value of $\lambda$ decreases with
the condensed fraction, $f_0$. It is one for $f_0=0$ and zero for $f_0=1$. For
a certain $f_0$ between 0 and 1, we find that $\lambda$ increases with the
average momentum of the particle pair and decreases with the particle number of
system. The results of $\lambda$ are sensitive to the ratio,
$\nu=\omega_z/\omega_{\rho}$, of the frequencies in longitudinal and transverse
directions. They are smaller for larger $\nu$ when $\omega_{\rho}$ is fixed. In

their corresponding tweets are displayed using an organic design. Among their

connections between dissimilar people. To evaluate our approach, we present a
case study on Twitter about a sensitive topic in Chile, where we estimate user

risk of cancer, which become a major clinical concern. The
backprojection-filtration (BPF) algorithm could reduce radiation dose by
reconstructing images from truncated data in a short scan. In dental CT, it
could reduce radiation dose for the teeth by using the projection acquired in a
short scan, and could avoid irradiation to other part by using truncated
projection. However, the limit of integration for backprojection varies per
PI-line, resulting in low calculation efficiency and poor parallel performance.
Recently, a tent BPF (T-BPF) has been proposed to improve calculation
efficiency by rearranging projection. However, the memory-consuming data
rebinning process is included. Accordingly, the chose-BPF (C-BPF) algorithm is
proposed in this paper. In this algorithm, the derivative of projection is
backprojected to the points whose x coordinate is less than that of the source
focal spot to obtain the differentiated backprojection (DBP). The finite
Hilbert inverse is then applied to each PI-line segment. C-BPF avoids the
influence of the variable limit of integration by selective backprojection
without additional time cost or memory cost. The simulation experiment and the
real experiment demonstrated the higher reconstruction efficiency of C-BPF.

$W$ function will be used extensively in our method for the evaluation of

be approximated by a canonical field with a redefined potential, which yields
predictions in better agreement with observations than the canonical
equivalents. For DBI inflation models we consider contributions from both the
scalar potential and the warp geometry. In the case of a quartic potential, we
find a formula for the observables under both non-relativistic and relativistic
behaviour of the scalar DBI inflaton. For a quadratic potential we find two
branches in the non-relativistic case, determined by the competition of model
parameters, while for the relativistic case we find consistency with results
already in the literature. We present a comparison to the latest Planck
satellite observations. Most of the non-canonical models we investigate,

$q$ on a mesh is to compute, in the associated graph, a shortest path from $p$
to $q$ that goes through one of $k$ sources, which are well-chosen vertices.
Precomputing the distance between each of the $k$ sources to all vertices of
the graph yields an efficient computation of approximate distances between any
two vertices. One standard method for choosing $k$ sources, which has been used
extensively and successfully for isometry-invariant surface processing, is the
so-called Farthest Point Sampling (FPS), which starts with a random vertex as
the first source, and iteratively selects the farthest vertex from the already
selected sources.
  In this paper, we analyze the stretch factor $\mathcal{F}_{FPS}$ of
approximate geodesics computed using FPS, which is the maximum, over all pairs
of distinct vertices, of their approximated distance over their geodesic
distance in the graph. We show that $\mathcal{F}_{FPS}$ can be bounded in terms
of the minimal value $\mathcal{F}^*$ of the stretch factor obtained using an
optimal placement of $k$ sources as $\mathcal{F}_{FPS}\leq 2 r_e^2
\mathcal{F}^*+ 2 r_e^2 + 8 r_e + 1$, where $r_e$ is the ratio of the lengths of
the longest and the shortest edges of the graph. This provides some evidence
explaining why farthest point sampling has been used successfully for
isometry-invariant shape processing. Furthermore, we show that it is
NP-complete to find $k$ sources that minimize the stretch factor.

algebras (complete Boolean algebras enriched with proximity) and Stone duality
with de Vries duality. For a compact Hausdorff space $X$ and a totally ordered
algebra $A$, we introduce the concept of a finitely valued normal function
$f:X\to A$. We show that the operations of $A$ lift to the set $FN(X,A)$ of all
finitely valued normal functions, and that there is a canonical proximity
relation $\prec$ on $FN(X,A)$. This gives rise to the de Vries power
construction, which when restricted to Stone spaces, yields the Boolean power

  We prove that de Vries powers of a totally ordered integral domain $A$ are
axiomatized as proximity Baer Specker $A$-algebras, those pairs $(S,\prec)$,
where $S$ is a torsion-free $A$-algebra generated by its idempotents that is a
Baer ring, and $\prec$ is a proximity relation on $S$. We introduce the
category of proximity Baer Specker $A$-algebras and proximity morphisms between

possibilities in parallel is appealing and over the years a number of quantum
algorithms have been developed offering great computational benefits. Systems
coupled to the environment lose quantum coherence quickly and realization of
schemes based on unitarity might be impossible. Recent discovery of room
temperature quantum coherence in light harvesting complexes opens up new
possibilities to borrow concepts from biology to use quantum effects for
computational purposes. While it has been conjectured that light harvesting
complexes such as the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex in the green sulfur
bacteria performs an efficient quantum search similar to the quantum Grover's
algorithm the analogy has yet to be established.
  In this work we show that quantum dissipation plays an essential role in the
quantum search performed in the FMO complex and it is fundamentally different
from known algorithms. In the FMO complex not just the optimal level of phase
breaking is present to avoid both quantum localization and Zeno trapping but it
can harness quantum dissipation as well to speed the process even further up.
With detailed quantum calculations taking into account both phase breaking and
quantum dissipation we show that the design of the FMO complex has been
evolutionarily optimized and works faster than pure quantum or
classical-stochastic algorithms. Inspired by the findings we introduce a new
computational concept based on decoherent quantum evolution. While it is
inspired by light harvesting systems, the new computational devices can also be
realized on different material basis opening new magnitude scales for
miniaturization and speed.

charcoal-coated surface. The helium is released by raising the first surface to
~30 K. In a separate regeneration step, deuterium and tritium are released at
~110 K. In this way, the helium can be pre-separated from other species. In the
simplest design, all three stages are in the same vessel, with a single valve
to close the pump off from the tokamak during regeneration. In an alternative
design, the three stages are in separate vessels, connected by valves, allowing
the stages to regenerate without interfering with each other. The inclusion of
the intermediate stage would not affect the overall pumping speed
significantly. The downstream exhaust processing system could be scaled down,
as much of the deuterium and tritium could be returned directly to the reactor.
This could reduce the required tritium reserve by almost 90%. We used a
well-established free Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) code, DS2V. At very
high upstream densities (~1020 molecules/m3 and above) the flow into the pump
is choked. Enlarging the aperture is the only way to increase the pumping speed
at high densities. Ninety percent of the deuterium and tritium is successfully
trapped at 15 K (assuming that the sticking coefficient is 80-100% on the 15-22
K surface). On the other hand, the remaining 10% still exceeds the small amount

consistency of the cortical activity recorded with magnetoencephalography in a

sometimes prodromal of dementia, during the execution of a memory task. We use
metrics coming from nonlinear dynamics to evaluate the consistency of cortical

atypical features are endowed with a network structure, the topological

correspond to strongly heterogeneous networks, whereas typical or normative

nodes. The analysis of this kind of networks allows identifying the extent to
which consistency is affecting the MCI group and the focal points where MCI is
specially severe. To the best of our knowledge, these results represent the
first attempt at evaluating the consistency of brain functional activity using

distance measure is defined on permutations. In this paper the Kendall's
$\tau$-metric is used as the distance measure. We present a general method for

from a snake of length $M_{2n-1}$ for permutations of~$S_{2n-1}$. Thus, we have

development of very complex social systems. To identify how ant-specific
adaptations are associated with patterns of molecular evolution, we searched
for signs of positive selection on amino-acid changes in proteins. We
identified 24 functional categories of genes which were enriched for positively
selected genes in the ant lineage. We also reanalyzed genome-wide datasets in
bees and flies with the same methodology, to check whether positive selection
was specific to ants or also present in other insects. Notably, genes
implicated in immunity were enriched for positively selected genes in the three
lineages, ruling out the hypothesis that the evolution of hygienic behaviors in
social insects caused a major relaxation of selective pressure on immune genes.
Our scan also indicated that genes implicated in neurogenesis and olfaction
started to undergo increased positive selection before the evolution of
sociality in Hymenoptera. Finally, the comparison between these three lineages
allowed us to pinpoint molecular evolution patterns that were specific to the
ant lineage. In particular, there was ant-specific recurrent positive selection
on genes with mitochondrial functions, suggesting that mitochondrial activity
was improved during the evolution of this lineage. This might have been an
important step toward the evolution of extreme lifespan that is a hallmark of
ants.

investigate the distribution of the logarithmic deviation of the $E_p$ value

curves. Based on this analysis, we propose to statistically classify GRBs in
the well-known $E_{p}$ vs. $E_{iso}$ plane with the logarithmic deviation of
the $E_p$ value. This classification scheme divides GRBs into two groups: Amati
type bursts and non-Amati type bursts. While Amati type bursts well follow the
Amati relation, non-Amati type bursts do not. It shows that most Amati type
bursts are long duration bursts and the majority of non-Amati type bursts are
short duration bursts. In addition, it reveals that Amati type bursts are
generally more energetic than non-Amati type bursts. An advantage of the new
classification is that the two kinds of burst are well distinguishable and

In this paper, we consider one QoS criterion--delay in a multiaccess system,

whether a multiaccess system can meet the different delay requirements of
users. For users with the same transmission power, we prove that only $N$

make the system delay feasible if power reallocation is available.

Hellinger-Reissner mixed problem of the elasticity equations. For two
dimensions, the normal stress of the matrix-valued stress field is approximated
by an enriched Brezzi-Douglas-Fortin-Marini element of order $k$, and the shear
stress by the serendipity element of order $k$, the displacement field by an
enriched discontinuous vector-valued $P_{k-1}$ element. The degrees of freedom
on each element of the lowest order element, which is of first order, is $10$
plus $4$. For three dimensions, the normal stress is approximated by an
enriched Raviart-Thomas element of order $k$, and each component of the shear
stress by a product space of the serendipity element space of two variables and
the space of polynomials of degree $\leq k-1$ with respect to the rest
variable, the displacement field by an enriched discontinuous vector-valued
$Q_{k-1}$ element. The degrees of freedom on each element of the lowest order
element, which is of first order, is $21$ plus $6$. A family of reduced
elements is also proposed by dropping some interior bubble functions of the
stress and employing the discontinuous vector-valued $P_{k-1}$ (resp.
$Q_{k-1}$) element for the displacement field on each element. As a result the
lowest order elements have $8$ plus $2$ and $18$ plus $3$ degrees of freedom on
each element for two and three dimensions, respectively.
  The well-posedness condition and the optimal a priori error estimate are
proved for this family of finite elements. Numerical tests are presented to

class of convex functionals of a pair of probability distributions including
Kullback-Leibler divergence, Rnyi-type relative entropy and so on. There are
several quantum versions so far, including the one by Petz. We introduce
another quantum version ($\mathrm{D}_{f}^{\max}$, below), defined as the
solution to an optimization problem, or the minimum classical $f$- divergence
necessary to generate a given pair of quantum states. It turns out to be the
largest quantum $f$-divergence. The closed formula of $\mathrm{D}_{f}^{\max}$
is given either if $f$ is operator convex, or if one of the state is a pure
state. Also, concise representation of $\mathrm{D}_{f}^{\max}$ as a pointwise
supremum of linear functionals is given and used for the clarification of
various properties of the quality.
  Using the closed formula of $\mathrm{D}_{f}^{\max}$, we show: Suppose $f$ is
operator convex. Then the\ maximum $f\,$- divergence of the probability
distributions of a measurement under the state $\rho$ and $\sigma$ is strictly
less than $\mathrm{D}_{f}^{\max}\left( \rho\Vert\sigma\right) $. This statement
may seem intuitively trivial, but when $f$ is not operator convex, this is not
always true. A counter example is $f\left( \lambda\right) =\left\vert

extended to infinite dimensional case.

We show that the Fano factor and the skewness of the SET current are minimized
for a symmetric SET configuration in the absence of the MBSs or when coupled to
a fermionic state. However, the minimum points of operation are shifted
appreciably in the presence of the MBSs to asymmetric SET configurations with a
higher tunnel rate at the drain than at the source. This feature persists even
when varying the nonlocal coupling and the pairing energy between the two MBSs.
We expect that these MBS-induced shifts can be measured experimentally with

Furthermore, we find structural parameters derived using passbands longwards of
the $g$ band and linked to older stellar populations, especially the stellar
mass surface density $\mu_*$ and the $r$ band effective radius $r_e$, to
perform at least equally well as parameters more traditionally linked to the
identification of spirals by means of their young stellar populations. In
particular the distinct bimodality in the parameter $\mu_*$, consistent with
expectations of different evolutionary paths for spirals and ellipticals,
represents an often overlooked yet powerful parameter in differentiating
between spiral and non-spiral/elliptical galaxies. We investigate the intrinsic
specific star-formation rate - stellar mass relation ($\psi_* - M_*$) for a
morphologically defined volume limited sample of local universe spiral
galaxies, defined using the cell-based method with an appropriate parameter
combination. The relation is found to be well described by $\psi_* \propto
M_*^{-0.5}$ over the range of $10^{9.5} M_{\odot} \le M_* \le 10^{11}

Specifically, we consider the case in which we wish to maximize a nondecreasing

with curvature $c$, we obtain a $(1-c/e)$-approximation --- the first
improvement over the greedy $(1-e^{-c})/c$-approximation of Conforti and
Cornuejols from 1984, which holds for a cardinality constraint, as well as
recent approaches that hold for an arbitrary matroid constraint.
  Our approach is based on modifications of the continuous greedy algorithm and
non-oblivious local search, and allows us to approximately maximize the sum of
a nonnegative, nondecreasing submodular function and a (possibly negative)
linear function. We show how to reduce both submodular maximization and
supermodular minimization to this general problem when the objective function
has bounded total curvature. We prove that the approximation results we obtain

functions and show $(1-c)$-approximation for maximization and
$1/(1-c)$-approximation for minimization cases. Finally, we give two concrete
applications of our results in the settings of maximum entropy sampling, and

of multi-body decays provides unique sensitivity to CP violation localised in

violation. If one assumes the no CP violation hypothesis, the probability of
getting the observed results is 9.1% and 41%, respectively.
  The model-independent determination of gamma from B->DK requires external
input to account for the interference of D0 and D0bar amplitudes to the same
final state. Previously this input could only be obtained at the charm
threshold, but recently it has been proposed that D mixing can provide
complimentary information. For the example of D->K+pi-pi+pi- decays, it is

  0CFA is complete for polynomial time. This result relies on the insight that

analysis makes no approximation; abstract and concrete interpretation coincide,
and therefore pro- gram analysis becomes evaluation under another guise.
Moreover, this is true not only for 0CFA, but for a number of further

the distinction in binding contexts results in a limited form of closures,
which do not occur in 0CFA. This theorem validates empirical observations that
$k$CFA is intractably slow for any $k > 0$. There is, in the worst case---and
plausibly, in practice---no way to tame the cost of the analysis. Exponential
time is required. The empirically observed intractability of this analysis can
be understood as being inherent in the approximation problem being solved,
rather than reflecting unfortunate gaps in our programming abilities.

constants, in calendars affiliated with the Shoushi calendar(Shoushili), such
as Datongli and Chiljeongsannaepyeon. It is known that those interval constants
were newly introduced in Shoushili and revised afterward, except for the Qi
interval constant, and the revised values were adopted in the
Shoushili-affiliated calendars. In this paper, we investigate first the
accuracy of the interval constants and then the accuracy of the
Shoushili-affilated calendars in terms of the interval constants by comparing
the times of the new moon and the solar eclipse maximum calculated by each
calendar with modern calculations. During our study, we found that the Qi and
Intercalation interval constants used in the early Shoushili were well
determined, whereas the Revolution and Crossing interval constants were
relatively poorly measured. We also found that the interval constants used by
the early Shoushili were better than those of the later one, and hence than
those of Datongli and Chiljeongsannaepyeon. On the other hand, we found that
the early Shoushili is, in general, a worse calendar than Datongli for use in
China but a better one than Chiljeongsannaepyeon for use in Korea in terms of
the new moon and the solar eclipse times, at least for the period 1281 - 1644.
Finally, we verified that the sunrise and sunset times recorded in
Shoushili-Li-Cheng and Mingshi are those at Beijing and Nanjing, respectively.

millisecond pulsar J1012+5307 can be interpreted as the signature of the
curvature radiation beam polarised orthogonally to the plane of electron
trajectory. Since the beam is intrinsically narrow (~1 deg), the associated
emission region must be small for the observed BEC to avoid smearing out by
spatial convolution. We estimate whether the energy available in the stream is
sufficient to produce such a bright feature in the averaged profile. The energy
considerations become complicated by the angular constraints imposed by the
width of the microbeam, and by the specific spectrum of the BEC which is found
to have the spectral index xi ~ -0.9 in comparison to the index of xi ~ -2 for
the total profile. For typical parameters, the luminosity of the BEC is
determined to be 4 10^{25} erg/s, whereas the maximum-possible
beam-size-limited power of the stream is L_max ~ 2 10^{29} erg/s. This implies
the minimum energy-conversion efficiency of eta ~ 2 10^{-4}. The BEC's
luminosity does not exceed any absolute limits of energetics, in particular, it
is smaller than the power of primary electron and/or secondary plasma stream.
However, the implied efficiency of energy transfer into the radio band is
extreme if the coherently emitting charge-separated plasma density is limited
to the Goldreich-Julian value. This suggests that the bifurcated shape of the
BEC has macroscopic origin, however, several uncertainties (eg. the dipole
inclination and spectral shape) make this conclusion not firm.

stars could come from two distinct populations: a first group arising from
massive stars that just left the main sequence (MS) and are crossing the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD) towards the red supergiant (RSG) branch, and
a second group coming from stars that have lost considerable amount of mass
during the RSG stage and are crossing the HRD for a second time towards the
blue region. Due to very different luminosity-to- mass ratio, only stars from
the second group are expected to have excited pulsations observable at the
surface. In a previous work, we have shown that our models were able to
reproduce the pulsational properties of BSGs. However, these models failed to
reproduce the surface chemical composition of stars evolving back from a RSG
phase. In this paper, we show how the use of the Ledoux criterion instead of
the Schwarzschild one for convection allows to significantly improve the
agreement with the observed chemical composition, while keeping the agreement
with the pulsation periods. This gives some support to the Ledoux criterion.

The C34S emission traces the 878 mum dust continuum well, and clearly shows a
smooth velocity gradient along the major axis of component I16293A. The CO
shows emission at moderate high velocities arising from two bipolar outflows,
which appear to be perpendicular with respect to each other. The high
sensitivity and higher angular resolution of these observations allows us to
pinpoint well the origin of these two outflows at the center of component
I16293A. Interestingly, the most compact outflow appears to point toward
I16293B. Our data show that the previously reported monopolar blueshifted CO
outflow associated with component I16293B seems to be part of the compact
outflow arising from component I16293A. In addition, the SiO emission is also
tracing this compact outflow: on one hand, the SiO emission appears to have a
jet-like morphology along the southern redshifted lobe; on the other hand, the
SiO emission associated with the blueshifted northern lobe traces a well
defined arc on the border of component I16293B facing I16293A. The blueshifted
CO lobe of the compact outflow splits into two lobes around the position of
this SiO arc. All these results lead us to propose that the compact outflow
from component I16293A is impacting on the circumstellar gas around component
I16293B, possibly being diverged as a consequence of the interaction.

neutrino beam produced 295 km from the Super-Kamiokande detector with a peak
energy of 0.6 GeV. A total of 28 electron neutrino events were detected with an
energy distribution consistent with an appearance signal, corresponding to a
significance of 7.3$\sigma$ when compared to 4.92 $\pm$ 0.55 expected
background events. In the PMNS mixing model, the electron neutrino appearance
signal depends on several parameters including three mixing angles
$\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{23}$, $\theta_{13}$, a mass difference $\Delta
m^2_{32}$ and a CP violating phase $\delta_{\mathrm{CP}}$. In this neutrino
oscillation scenario, assuming $|\Delta m^2_{32}| = 2.4 \times 10^{-3}$ $\rm
eV^2$, $\sin^2 \theta_{23} = 0.5$, and $\Delta m^2_{32} >0$ ($\Delta m^2_{32}

combining the result with the current best knowledge of oscillation parameters
including the world average value of $\theta_{13}$ from reactor experiments,
some values of $\delta_{\mathrm{CP}}$ are disfavored at the 90% CL.

out that, in the presence of a gravity source $M$, particles will see different

4D-observers, the equivalence principle will be violated. As a consequence, we
show that a hydrogen atom in the gravitational field of $M$ will acquire a
radial electric dipole. This effect is regulated by the Hamiltonian
$H_{d}=-\mu\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{\delta r}$, which is the gravitational analog
of the Stark Hamiltonian, where the electric field is replaced by the tidal

value function defined over a single polyhedral partition without any overlaps.
This enables efficient point location approaches using a single binary search

demonstrate an online speedup up to an order of magnitude. We also show how the

yields no evidence for charge stripes in La1.6Sr0.4CoO4 which is supported by
our phonon studies. With the observation of an hour-glass-shaped excitation
spectrum in this stripe-less insulating cobaltate, we provide experimental
evidence that the hour-glass spectrum is neither necessarily connected to
charge stripes nor to band structure effects, but instead, probably intimately
coupled to frustration and arising chiral or non-collinear magnetic
correlations.

is believed that the use or otherwise of FM is adaptive to the acoustic
environment, and also that there are specific social uses of FM such as trills
in aggressive territorial encounters. Yet temporal fine detail of FM is often
absent or obscured in standard audio signal analysis methods such as Fourier
analysis or linear prediction. Hence it is important to consider high
resolution signal processing techniques for analysis of FM in bird
vocalisations. If such methods can be applied at big data scales, this offers a
further advantage as large datasets become available.
  We introduce methods from the signal processing literature which can go
beyond spectrogram representations to analyse the fine modulations present in a
signal at very short timescales. Focusing primarily on the genus Phylloscopus,
we investigate which of a set of four analysis methods most strongly captures
the species signal encoded in birdsong. In order to find tools useful in
practical analysis of large databases, we also study the computational time
taken by the methods, and their robustness to additive noise and MP3
compression.
  We find three methods which can robustly represent species-correlated FM
attributes, and that the simplest method tested also appears to perform the
best. We find that features representing the extremes of FM encode species
identity supplementary to that captured in frequency features, whereas
bandwidth features do not encode additional information.
  Large-scale FM analysis can efficiently extract information useful for
bioacoustic studies, in addition to measures more commonly used to characterise
vocalisations.

approach when measuring $\eta$ to avoid introducing a theoretical bias into the
results. In this paper we forecast the precision with which future large
surveys can determine $\eta$ in a way that only relies on directly observable
quantities. In particular, we do not assume anything concerning the initial
spectrum of perturbations, nor on its evolution outside the observed redshift
range, nor on the galaxy bias. We first leave $\eta$ free to vary in space and
time and then we model it as suggested in Horndeski models of dark energy.
Among our results, we find that a future large scale lensing and clustering
survey can constrain $\eta$ to within 10% if $k$-independent, and to within 60%

scientific goals of large-volume neutrino telescopes. The fundamental
observable in such detectors is the Cherenkov light produced by the transit
through a medium of charged particles created in neutrino interactions. The
amount of light emitted is proportional to the deposited energy, which is
approximately equal to the neutrino energy for $\nu_e$ and $\nu_\mu$
charged-current interactions and can be used to set a lower bound on neutrino
energies and to measure neutrino spectra statistically in other channels. Here
we describe methods and performance of reconstructing charged-particle energies
and topologies from the observed Cherenkov light yield, including techniques to
measure the energies of uncontained muon tracks, achieving average
uncertainties in electromagnetic-equivalent deposited energy of $\sim 15\%$

stock market behaviour using Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The trend once followed
over a particular period will sure repeat in future. The one day difference in
close value of stocks for a certain period is found and its corresponding
steady state probability distribution values are determined. The pattern of the
stock market behaviour is then decided based on these probability values for a
particular time. The goal is to figure out the hidden state sequence given the
observation sequence so that the trend can be analyzed using the steady state
probability distribution( ) values. Six optimal hidden state sequences are
generated and compared. The one day difference in close value when considered
is found to give the best optimum state sequence.

within a hard circular boundary inhibits the hexagonal ordering observed in
bulk systems at high density. Using colloidal experiments and Monte Carlo
simulations, we investigate two model systems of quasi hard discs under
circularly symmetric confinement. The first system employs an adaptive circular
boundary, defined experimentally using holographic optical tweezers. We show
that deformation of this boundary allows, and indeed is required for, hexagonal
ordering in the confined system. The second system employs a circularly
symmetric optical potential to confine particles without a physical boundary.

exceeding the shock-compressed interstellar field has been inferred. We outline
how such a field amplification results from a small-scale dynamo process
downstream of the shock, providing an explicit expression for the turbulence
back-reaction to the fluid whirling. The spatial scale of the $X-$ray rims and
the short time-variability can be obtained by using reasonable parameters for

the geometry of a cosmic string compactified along its axis. In addition, we
assume the presence of two types of magnetic fluxes: a flux running along the
cosmic string and another enclosed by the compact dimension. These fluxes give
rise to Aharanov-Bohm-like effects on the VEVs. The VEVs are decomposed into
two parts corresponding to the geometry of a straight cosmic string without
compactification plus a topological part induced by the compactification of the
string axis. Both contributions are even periodic functions of the magnetic
fluxes with period equal to the flux quantum. The vacuum energy density is
equal to the radial stress for the parts corresponding to the straight cosmic
string and the topological one. Moreover, the axial stress is equal to the
energy density for the parts corresponding to the straight cosmic string;
however, for massive fermionic field this does not occur for the topological
contributions. With respect to the dependence on the magnetic fluxes, both, the
fermionic condensate and the vacuum energy density, can be either positive or
negative. Moreover, for points near the string, the main contribution to the
VEVs comes from the straight cosmic string part, whereas at large distances the
topological ones dominate. In addition to the local characteristics of the
vacuum state, we also evaluate the part in the topological Casimir energy
induced by the string.

similarity measures to the problem of shape correspondence, adopting spectral

spectral embedding distance and the novel spectral quasi-conformal distance,

channel-out networks, pathways are not only formed a posteriori, but they are
also actively selected according to the inference outputs from the lower
layers. From a mathematical perspective, channel-out networks can represent a
wider class of piece-wise continuous functions, thereby endowing the network
with more expressive power than that of maxout networks. We test our
channel-out networks on several well-known image classification benchmarks,

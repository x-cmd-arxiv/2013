tackled with traditional nonlinear filtering techniques such as the extended

techniques assume Gaussian distributions to account for system noise and
uncertain measurements. This distributional assumption does not consider the
periodic nature of pose and orientation uncertainty. We propose a filter that
considers the periodicity of the orientation estimation problem in its
distributional assumption. This is achieved by making use of the Bingham
distribution, which is defined on the hypersphere and thus inherently more
suitable to periodic problems. Furthermore, handling of non-trivial system

from a modal formalism by emphasizing the role of the symmetries of the
objects. More precisely, as the symmetry is broken in the transition from the
circular disc to the elliptical one, the splitting up of resonances and level
crossings are observed. From the mathematical point of view, this observation
can be explained by the broken invariance of the continuous symmetry group O(2)
associated with the circular disc. The elliptical disc is however invariant
under the finite group C2v and the resonances are classified and associated
with a given irreducible representation of this group. The main difficulty
arises in the application of the group theory in elastodynamics where the
vectorial formalism is used to express the physical quantities (elastic
displacement and stress) involved in the boundary conditions. However, this
method significantly simplifies the numerical treatment of the problem which is
uncoupled over the four irreducible representations of C2v. This provides a
full classification of the resonances. They are tagged and tracked as the
eccentricity of the elliptical disc increases. Then, the splitting up of
resonances, which occurs in the transition from the circular disc to the
elliptic one, is emphasized. The computation of displacement normal modes also
highlights the mode splittings. A physical interpretation of resonances in
terms of geometrical paths is provided.

flow we tentatively identify with the so-called Magnetically-Frustrated

roughly speaking, a collection of Prandtl's turbulent jets. The 1-law flow,
being a first-kind self-similar solution, may actually occur in nature (in
collisionless plasma).

technology---and its variations abound. Amongst the most well known is Shivers'
0CFA; however, the best known algorithm for 0CFA requires time cubic in the
size of the analyzed program and is unlikely to be improved. Consequently,
several analyses have been designed to approximate 0CFA by trading precision
for faster computation. Henglein's simple closure analysis, for example,
forfeits the notion of directionality in flows and enjoys an ""almost linear""
time algorithm. But in making trade-offs between precision and complexity, what
has been given up and what has been gained? Where do these analyses differ and
where do they coincide?
  We identify a core language---the linear $\lambda$-calculus---where 0CFA,
simple closure analysis, and many other known approximations or restrictions to
0CFA are rendered identical. Moreover, for this core language, analysis
corresponds with (instrumented) evaluation. Because analysis faithfully
captures evaluation, and because the linear $\lambda$-calculus is complete for
PTIME, we derive PTIME-completeness results for all of these analyses.

temperature thermodynamic transition to the glass state exists or not. Recent
simulations of coupled replicas in atomistic models have found signatures of a
static transition as a function of replica coupling. This can be viewed as
evidence of an associated thermodynamic glass transition in the uncoupled
system. We demonstrate here that a different interpretation is possible. We
consider the triangular plaquette model, an interacting spin system which
displays (East model-like) glassy dynamics in the absence of any static
transition. We show that when two replicas are coupled there is a curve of
equilibrium phase transitions, between phases of small and large overlap, in
the temperature-coupling plane (located on the self-dual line of an exact
temperature/coupling duality of the system) which ends at a critical point.
Crucially, in the limit of vanishing coupling the finite temperature transition
disappears, and the uncoupled system is in the disordered phase at all
temperatures. We discuss interpretation of atomistic simulations in light of
this result.

understanding of the traffic and multiplexing characteristics of the different
representation formats of 3D video. We examine the average bitrate-distortion
(RD) and bitrate variability-distortion (VD) characteristics of three main

representation and encoding, frame sequential (FS) representation, and
side-by-side (SBS) representation, whereby conventional single-view encoding is
employed for the FS and SBS representations. Our results for long 3D videos in
full HD format indicate that the MV representation and encoding achieves the
highest RD efficiency, while exhibiting the highest bitrate variabilities. We
examine the impact of these bitrate variabilities on network transport through
extensive statistical multiplexing simulations. We find that when multiplexing
a small number of streams, the MV and FS representations require the same
bandwidth. However, when multiplexing a large number of streams or smoothing
traffic, the MV representation and encoding reduces the bandwidth requirement
relative to the FS representation.

lead to a discovery of inherent cosmic SI violation in the CMB temperature \&

as a dipolar power asymmetry of the CMB temperature field in two hemispheres.
Statistical studies of SI violation effect require non-SI (nSI) Gaussian
realizations of CMB temperature field. The nSI Gaussian temperature field leads

polynomials has important applications in numerical analysis. From truncating
the operator to form a Jacobi matrix, one can apply the Golub--Welsh algorithm
to compute the Gaussian quadrature weights and nodes. Furthermore, the entries
of the Jacobi operator are the coefficients in the three-term recurrence
relationship for the polynomials. This provides an efficient method for
evaluating the orthogonal polynomials. Here, we present an $\mathcal O(N)$
method to compute the first $N$ rows of Jacobi operators from the associated
weight. The method exploits the Riemann--Hilbert representation of the
polynomials by solving a deformed Riemann--Hilbert problem numerically. We
further adapt this computational approach to certain entire weights that are
beyond the reach of current asymptotic Riemann--Hilbert techniques.

  arXiv:1311.5840v1[quant-ph]",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  I propose to resolve the controversy over the speed of collapse of
quantum-mechanical wavefunctions by means of an experimental test with a
modified symmetric Mach-Zehnder atom interferometer, with non-intersecting,
parallel, widely separated final beams. According to the conventional collapse
scenario, the coherent twin-peak atomic wavefunction in the beams of the
interferometer suffers an instantaneous collapse, at infinite speed, when the
atom is captured by one of the two detectors at the ends of the beams, but it
remains coherent until that instant. In contrast, according to the
Hellwig-Kraus relativistic collapse scenario, the wavefunction collapses at the
speed of light, backward in time along the past light cone of each detector.
This leads to a premature collapse, or pre-collapse, which for a beam-to-beam
separation of 3 m extends over a time span of 10 ns before arrival at the
detectors. Within this time span the paired wavepackets in the two beams will
be incoherent. The difference between the coherent wavepackets of the
conventional scenario and the incoherent wavepackets of the relativistic
scenario can be tested by probing the atomic beams with a transverse laser beam
crossing them near the detectors. If the paired atomic wavepackets in the two
beams are coherent, the light scattered by the two beams will also be coherent
and generate a standing light wave in the space between the beams, with
detectable interference fringes. If the paired wavepackets are incoherent, no
such interference fringes will be generated, and the distribution of the
scattered light will be that of two independent dipoles. The design parameters
for this test seem to lie within reach of the techniques of atom
interferometry.

this coupling. Therefore, this would possibly lead to some observational
consequences, such as space-time variations of nature's fundamental constants.
In this paper we investigate the coupling between a dynamical Dark Energy model

$\alpha_0$. In particular, we derive joint constraints on two dynamical Dark
Energy model parametrizations (the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder and Early Dark
Energy model) and on the coupling with electromagnetism $\zeta$, forecasting
future low-medium redshift observations. We combine supernovae and weak lensing
measurements from the Euclid experiment with high-resolution spectroscopy
measurements of fundamental couplings and the redshift drift from the European
Extremely Large Telescope, highlighting the contribution of each probe.
Moreover, we also consider the case where the field driving the $\alpha$
evolution is not the one responsible for cosmic acceleration and investigate
how future observations can constrain this scenario.

the role of dissipation in a topological Josephson junction. We show that the
combined effects of topology and dissipation keeps phase and anti-phase slips
strongly correlated so that the device is superconducting even under conditions

However, real-time application of the available CA models in traffic control
systems is a difficult task due to their discrete and stochastic nature. This
paper introduces a novel method for simulation of signalised traffic streams,
which combines CA and fuzzy numbers. The introduced traffic simulation
algorithm eliminates main drawbacks of the CA approach, i.e. necessity of
multiple Monte Carlo simulations and calibration issues. Computational cost of
traffic simulation for the proposed algorithm is considerably lower than the
cost of simulation based on stochastic CA. Thus, the simulation results can be
obtained in a much shorter time. Experiments confirmed that the simulation
results for the introduced algorithm are consistent with that observed for
stochastic CA. The proposed simulation algorithm is suitable for real-time
applications in traffic control systems.

planar maps weighted with a $O(n=2)$ loop model or a $Q=4$-state Potts model
embedded in a two dimensional surface in a conformal manner.
  Following \cite{GRV1}, we start by constructing the critical LBM from one
fixed point $x\in\mathbb{R}^2$ (or $x\in\S^2$), which amounts to changing the
speed of a standard planar Brownian motion depending on the local behaviour of
the critical Liouville measure $M'(dx)=-X(x)e^{2X(x)}\,dx$ (where $X$ is a
Gaussian Free Field, say on $\mathbb{S}^2$). Extending this construction
simultaneously to all points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ requires a fine analysis of the
potential properties of the measure $M'$. This allows us to construct a strong
Markov process with continuous sample paths living on the support of $M'$,
namely a dense set of Hausdorff dimension $0$. We finally construct the
associated Liouville semigroup, resolvent, Green function, heat kernel and
Dirichlet form.
  In passing, we extend to quite a general setting the construction of the
critical Gaussian multiplicative chaos that was initiated in
\cite{Rnew7,Rnew12} and also establish new capacity estimates for the critical

related to massive neutrinos. Neutrino oscillations have provided indisputable
evidence in favour of non-zero neutrino masses and mixings. However, the
original formulation of the Standard Model cannot account for these
observations, which calls for the introduction of new Physics. Among many
possibilities, we focus here on the inverse seesaw, a neutrino mass generation
mechanism in which the Standard Model is extended with fermionic gauge
singlets. This model offers an attractive alternative to the usual seesaw
realisations since it can potentially have natural Yukawa couplings
($\mathcal{O}(1)$) while keeping the new Physics scale at energies within reach
of the LHC. Among the many possible effects, this scenario can lead to
deviations from lepton flavour universality. We have investigated these
signatures and found that the ratios $R_K$ and $R_\pi$ provide new, additional
constraints on the inverse seesaw. We have also considered the embedding of the
inverse seesaw in supersymmetric models. This leads to increased rates for
various lepton flavour violating processes, due to enhanced contributions from
penguin diagrams mediated by the Higgs and $Z^0$ bosons. Finally, we also found
that the new invisible decay channels associated with the sterile neutrinos
present in the supersymmetric inverse seesaw could significantly weaken the
constraints on the mass and couplings of a light CP-odd Higgs boson.

cosmological large eddy simulations for two halos of a few times $\rm 10^{7}

increase the circular velocities from about 14 $\rm km/s$ to 16 $\rm km/s$.

found that the impact of streaming velocities is less severe in massive halos

synchrotron model, with inverse-Compton emerging only above a few GeV. The high
ratio of the early optical to late radio flux requires that the ambient medium
is a wind and that the forward-shock synchrotron spectrum peaks in the optical
at about 10 ks. The latter has two consequences: the wind must be very tenuous
and the optical emission before 10 ks must arise from the reverse-shock, as
suggested also by the bright optical flash that Raptor has monitored during the
prompt emission phase (<100 s). The VLA radio emission is from the
reverse-shock, the Swift X-ray emission is mostly from the forward-shock, but
the both shocks give comparable contributions to the Fermi GeV emission. The
weak wind implies a large blast-wave radius (8 t_{day}^{1/2} pc), which
requires a very tenuous circumstellar medium, suggesting that the massive
stellar progenitor of GRB 130427A resided in a super-bubble.

conditions for the exact recovery of the sparsest solution to the polynomial

obtained for the noisy case. Though lacking a similar analysis, the second
approach provides a more computationally efficient algorithm based on a greedy
strategy adding the groups one-by-one. With respect to previous work, the
proposed methods recover the sparsest solution in a very short computing time
while remaining at least as accurate in terms of the probability of success.
This probability is empirically analyzed to emphasize the relationship between
the ability of the methods to solve the polynomial system and the sparsity of

by weeks or months. This regimen has been motivated mostly by radiobiological
considerations, but also provides an approach to reduce normal tissue dose by
exploiting tumor shrinkage. The paper considers the optimal design of
multi-stage treatments, motivated by the clinical management of large liver
tumors for which normal liver dose constraints prohibit the administration of
an ablative radiation dose in a single treatment.
  We introduce a dynamic tumor model that incorporates three factors: radiation
induced cell kill, tumor shrinkage, and tumor cell repopulation. The design of
multi-stage radiotherapy is formulated as a mathematical optimization problem
in which the total dose to the liver is minimized, subject to delivering the
prescribed dose to the tumor. Based on the model, we gain insight into the
optimal administration of radiation over time, i.e. the optimal treatment gaps
and dose levels.
  We analyze treatments consisting of two stages in detail. The analysis
confirms the intuition that the second stage should be delivered just before
the tumor size reaches a minimum and repopulation overcompensates shrinking.
Furthermore, it was found that, for a large range of model parameters,
approximately one third of the dose should be delivered in the first stage. The
projected benefit of multi-stage treatments depends on model assumptions.
However, the model predicts large liver dose reductions by more than a factor
of two for plausible model parameters.
  The analysis of the tumor model suggests that substantial reduction in normal
tissue dose can be achieved by exploiting tumor shrinkage via an optimal design
of multi-stage treatments. This suggests taking a fresh look at multi-stage
radiotherapy for selected disease sites where substantial tumor regression
translates into reduced target volumes.

laser detects a good approximation of a point if this point is not a corner of
the object. So in many cases our data set will not contain the real corners.
Our task is to present a method on how to find these particular points. A third
purpose is to study the regularity of the approximating curve, which can be
$G^1$ or $C^0$ continuous. The entire method is developed using single arcs,
segments and in certain cases biarcs, in order to ensure the smoothness of the
final path.

  Van Enter (in the case $d=r=2$) and Schonmann (for all $d \geq r \geq 2$)
proved that $r$-neighbour bootstrap percolation models have trivial critical
probabilities on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for every choice of the parameters $d \geq r
\geq 2$: that is, an initial set of density $p$ almost surely percolates
$\mathbb{Z}^d$ for every $p>0$. These results effectively ended the study of
bootstrap percolation on infinite lattices.
  Recently Bollob\'as, Smith and Uzzell introduced a broad class of percolation
models called $\mathcal{U}$-bootstrap percolation, which includes $r$-neighbour
bootstrap percolation as a special case. They divided two-dimensional
$\mathcal{U}$-bootstrap percolation models into three classes -- subcritical,
critical and supercritical -- and they proved that, like classical 2-neighbour
bootstrap percolation, critical and supercritical $\mathcal{U}$-bootstrap
percolation models have trivial critical probabilities on $\mathbb{Z}^2$. They
left open the question as to what happens in the case of subcritical families.
In this paper we answer that question: we show that every subcritical
$\mathcal{U}$-bootstrap percolation model has a non-trivial critical
probability on $\mathbb{Z}^2$. This is new except for a certain `degenerate'
subclass of symmetric models that can be coupled from below with oriented site
percolation. Our results re-open the study of critical probabilities in
bootstrap percolation on infinite lattices, and they allow one to ask many
questions of subcritical bootstrap percolation models that are typically asked
of site or bond percolation.

scattering rate can receive large and nucleus-dependent corrections at
next-to-leading order (NLO) in the chiral expansion. The size of these
corrections depends on the specific couplings of dark matter to quark flavors
and gluons. In general the full NLO dark-matter-nucleus cross-section is not
adequately described by just the zero-energy proton and neutron couplings.
These statements are concretely illustrated in a scenario where the dark matter
couples to quarks through scalar operators. We find the canonical IVDM scenario
can reconcile the null XENON and LUX results and the recent CDMS-Si findings
provided its couplings to second and third generation quarks either lie on a
special line or are suppressed. Equally good fits with new values of the
neutron-to-proton coupling ratio are found in the presence of nonzero heavy

currently the most complete map of resolved stellar populations in any galactic
halo. Despite copious substructure, the global halo populations follow closely
power law profiles that become steeper with increasing metallicity. We divide
the sample into stream-like populations and a smooth halo component. Fitting a
three-dimensional halo model reveals that the most metal-poor populations
([Fe/H]<-1.7) are distributed approximately spherically (slightly prolate with
ellipticity c/a=1.09+/-0.03), with only a relatively small fraction (42%)
residing in discernible stream-like structures. The sphericity of the ancient
smooth component strongly hints that the dark matter halo is also approximately
spherical. More metal-rich populations contain higher fractions of stars in
streams (86% for [Fe/H]>-0.6). The space density of the smooth metal-poor
component has a global power-law slope of -3.08+/-0.07, and a non-parametric
fit shows that the slope remains nearly constant from 30kpc to 300kpc. The
total stellar mass in the halo at distances beyond 2 degrees is 1.1x10^10 Solar
masses, while that of the smooth component is 3x10^9 Solar masses.
Extrapolating into the inner galaxy, the total stellar mass of the smooth halo
is plausibly 8x10^9 Solar masses. We detect a substantial metallicity gradient,
which declines from [Fe/H]=-0.7 at R=30kpc to [Fe/H]=-1.5 at R=150kpc for the
full sample, with the smooth halo being 0.2dex more metal poor than the full
sample at each radius. While qualitatively in-line with expectations from
cosmological simulations, these observations are of great importance as they
provide a prototype template that such simulations must now be able to
reproduce in quantitative detail.

(a=0.0) and a spinning black hole (a=0.9) are presented. The accretion rates in
the two models are \dot M = 100-200 \dot M_Edd. These first general
relativistic simulations of super-critical black hole accretion are potentially
relevant to tidal disruption events and hyper-accreting supermassive black
holes in the early universe. Both simulated models are optically and
geometrically thick, and have funnels through which energy escapes in the form
of relativistic gas, Poynting flux and radiative flux. The jet is significantly
more powerful in the a=0.9 run. The net energy outflow rate in the two runs
correspond to efficiencies of 5% (a=0) and 33% (a=0.9), as measured with
respect to the mass accretion rate at the black hole. These efficiencies agree
well with those measured in previous simulations of non-radiative geometrically
thick disks. Furthermore, in the a=0.9 run, the outflow power appears to
originate in the spinning black hole, suggesting that the associated physics is
again similar in non-radiative and super-critical accretion flows. While the
two simulations are efficient in terms of total energy outflow, both runs are
radiatively inefficient. Their luminosities are only \sim 1-10 L_Edd, which
corresponds to a radiative efficiency \sim 0.1%. Interestingly, most of the
radiative luminosity emerges through the funnels, which subtend a very small
solid angle. Therefore, measured in terms of a local radiative flux, the
emitted radiation is highly super-Eddington.

these properties, derive the most general flux that induces an M2 potential,
and show that it is parameterised in terms of two real vectors. We study the
supersymmetry equations when only this flux is present and show that over the
locus where the M2 potential is non-vanishing the background takes the form of
a Calabi-Yau three-fold fibered over a 2-dimensional base spanned by the flux
vectors, while at the minima of the potential the flux vanishes. Allowing also
for non-vanishing four-form flux with one leg in the internal directions we
find that the Calabi-Yau three-fold in the fibration is replaced by an

  Improving target volume delineation",,,"10.1088/0031-9155/59/3/747",,"physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Glioblastoma are known to infiltrate the brain parenchyma instead of forming
a solid tumor mass with a defined boundary. Only the part of the tumor with
high tumor cell density can be localized through imaging directly. In contrast,
brain tissue infiltrated by tumor cells at low density appears normal on
current imaging modalities. In clinical practice, a uniform margin is applied
to account for microscopic spread of disease.
  The current treatment planning procedure can potentially be improved by
accounting for the anisotropy of tumor growth: Anatomical barriers such as the
falx cerebri represent boundaries for migrating tumor cells. In addition, tumor
cells primarily spread in white matter and infiltrate gray matter at lower
rate. We investigate the use of a phenomenological tumor growth model for
treatment planning. The model is based on the Fisher-Kolmogorov equation, which
formalizes these growth characteristics and estimates the spatial distribution
of tumor cells in normal appearing regions of the brain. The target volume for
radiotherapy planning can be defined as an isoline of the simulated tumor cell
density.
  A retrospective study involving 10 glioblastoma patients has been performed.
To illustrate the main findings of the study, a detailed case study is
presented for a glioblastoma located close to the falx. In this situation, the
falx represents a boundary for migrating tumor cells, whereas the corpus
callosum provides a route for the tumor to spread to the contralateral
hemisphere. We further discuss the sensitivity of the model with respect to the
input parameters. Correct segmentation of the brain appears to be the most
crucial model input.
  We conclude that the tumor growth model provides a method to account for
anisotropic growth patterns of glioblastoma, and may therefore provide a tool
to make target delineation more objective and automated.

droplet-based microfluidic devices as it enhances mixing, chemical reaction and
heat transfer. The occurrence of fluid slip at the wall, which becomes
prominent at high shear rates and lower length scales, results in a significant
change in droplet circulation. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the
presence of circulation in droplets is demonstrated and quantified. Circulation
is shown to vary inversely with slip length, which is a measure of interface
wettability. A simple circulation model is established that captures the effect
of slip on droplet circulation. Scaling parameters for circulation and slip
length are identified from the circulation model which leads to the collapse of
data for droplets with varying aspect ratio (AR) and slip length. The model is
validated using continuum and MD simulations and is shown to be accurate for

about 10% of early F-, A- and late B-type stars present chemical peculiarities,
which rise as a result of diffusion. A detailed study of the evolution of the
chemical peculiarities as traces of diffusion processes requires the precise
knowledge of stellar ages and initial chemical composition. Open clusters
provide these information: 1) it is possible to assume that all cluster members
have approximately the same original chemical composition and age; 2) the age
of stars belonging to open clusters can be determined with much higher accuracy
than for field stars. For this reason chemically peculiar stars member of open

change abruptly from rowing to flapping. The classical fluid dynamics approach
to consider the mayfly nymph as a pumping device fails in giving clear reasons
to this switch. In order to understand the whys and the hows of this switch
between the two distinct kinematics, we analyze the problem under a Lagrangian
viewpoint. We consider that a good Lagrangian transport that distributes and
spreads water and dissolved oxygen well between and around the gills is the
main goal of the gill motion. Using this Lagrangian approach we are able to
provide the reason behind the switch from rowing to flapping that the mayfly
nymph experiences as it grows. More precisely, recent and powerful tools from
this Lagrangian approach are applied to in-sillico mayfly nymph experiments,
where body shape, as well as, gill shapes, structures and kinematics are
matched to those from in-vivo. In this letter, we show both qualitatively and
quantitatively how the change of kinematics enables a better attraction,
stirring and confinement of water charged of dissolved oxygen inside the gills
area. From the computational velocity field we reveal attracting barriers to
transport, i.e. attracting Lagrangian coherent structures, that form the
transport skeleton between and around the gills. In addition, we quantify how
well the fluid particles and consequently dissolved oxgen is spread and stirred
inside the gills area.

continuum emission. In such regions, a young massive star is probably ablating,
through its ultraviolet radiation, the molecular cloud clump that spawned it.
On one side of the star, the radiation drives an ionization front that stalls
in dense molecular gas. On the other side, ionized gas streams outward into the
more rarefied environment. This wind is underpressured with respect to the
neutral gas. The difference in pressure draws in more cloud material, feeding
the wind until the densest molecular gas is dissipated.
  Recent, time-dependent simulations of massive stars turning on within
molecular gas show the system evolving in a direction similar to that just
described. Here, we explore a semi-analytic model in which the wind is
axisymmetric and has already achieved a steady state. Adoption of this
simplified picture allows us to study the dependence of both the wind and its
bounding ionization front on the stellar luminosity, the peak molecular
density, and the displacement of the star from the center of the clump. For
typical parameter values, the wind accelerates transonically to a speed of
about 15 km / s, and transports mass outward at a rate of 10^-4 solar masses
per year. Stellar radiation pressure acts to steepen the density gradient of
the wind.

z=0.62 in a LAOZI cosmological adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamic simulation
is performed and insights gained on star formation quenching and color
migration. The vast majority of red galaxies are found to be within three
virial radii of a larger galaxy, at the onset of quenching when the specific
star formation rate experiences the sharpest decline to fall below
~10^{-2}-10^{-1}/Gyr (depending on the redshift). We shall thus call this
mechanism ""environment quenching"", which encompasses satellite quenching. Two
physical processes are largely responsible: ram-pressure stripping first
disconnects the galaxy from the cold gas supply on large scales, followed by a
longer period of cold gas starvation taking place in high velocity dispersion
environment, during the early part of which the existing dense cold gas in the
central region (<10kpc) is consumed by in situ star formation. Quenching is
found to be more efficient, but not faster, on average, in denser environment.
Throughout this quenching period and the ensuing one in the red sequence
galaxies follow nearly vertical tracks in the color-stellar-mass diagram. In
contrast, individual galaxies of all masses grow most of their stellar masses
in the blue cloud, prior to the onset of quenching, and progressively more
massive blue galaxies with already relatively older mean stellar ages continue
to enter the red sequence. Consequently, correlations among observables of red
galaxies - such as the age-mass relation - are largely inherited from their
blue progenitors at the onset of quenching. While the color makeup of the
entire galaxy population strongly depends on environment, which is a direct
result of environment quenching, physical properties of blue galaxies as a
sub-population show little dependence on environment.

introduce notions of probabilistic fixed points for such random monotone

bounds for end-user satisfaction. Furthermore, the tolerable delay varies
depending on the use case such as live streaming or two-way video conferencing.
Due to the inherently stochastic nature of wireless fading channels,
deterministic delay bounds are difficult to guarantee. Instead, we propose
providing statistical delay guarantees using the concept of effective capacity.
We consider a multiuser setup whereby different users have (possibly different)
delay QoS constraints. We derive the resource allocation policy that maximizes
the sum video quality and applies to any quality metric with concave
rate-quality mapping. We show that the optimal operating point per user is such
that the rate-distortion slope is the inverse of the supported video source
rate per unit bandwidth, a key metric we refer to as the source spectral
efficiency. We also solve the alternative problem of fairness-based resource
allocation whereby the objective is to maximize the minimum video quality
across users. Finally, we derive user admission and scheduling policies that
enable selecting a maximal user subset such that all selected users can meet
their statistical delay requirement. Results show that video users with
differentiated QoS requirements can achieve similar video quality with vastly
different resource requirements. Thus, QoS-aware scheduling and resource
allocation enable supporting significantly more users under the same resource
constraints.

often governed by simultaneous propagation of positive and negative influences.
Consider a planner trying to introduce an idea in different parts of a society
at different times. How should the planner design a schedule considering this
fact that positive reaction to the idea in early areas has a positive impact on
probability of success in later areas, whereas a flopped reaction has exactly
the opposite impact? We generalize a well-known economic model which has been
recently used by Chierichetti, Kleinberg, and Panconesi (ACM EC'12). In this
model the reaction of each area is determined by its initial preference and the
reaction of early areas. We generalize previous works by studying the problem
when people in different areas have various behaviors.
  We first prove, independent of the planner's schedule, influences help
(resp., hurt) the planner to propagate her idea if it is an appealing (resp.,
unappealing) idea. We also study the problem of designing the optimal
non-adaptive spreading strategy. In the non-adaptive spreading strategy, the
schedule is fixed at the beginning and is never changed. Whereas, in adaptive
spreading strategy the planner decides about the next move based on the current
state of the cascade. We demonstrate that it is hard to propose a non-adaptive
spreading strategy in general. Nevertheless, we propose an algorithm to find
the best non-adaptive spreading strategy when probabilities of different
behaviors of people in various areas drawn i.i.d from an unknown distribution.
Then, we consider the influence propagation phenomenon when the underlying
influence network can be any arbitrary graph. We show it is $\#P$-complete to
compute the expected number of adopters for a given spreading strategy.

preventing and controlling diseases, as well as facilitating the socially
responsible information while depressing destructive rumors. In network-based
spreading dynamics, edges with different weights may play far different roles:
a friend from afar usually brings novel stories, and an intimate relationship
is highly risky for a flu epidemic. In this article, we propose a weighted
susceptible-infected-susceptible model on complex networks, where the weight of
an edge is defined by the topological proximity of the two associated nodes.
Each infected individual is allowed to select limited number of neighbors to
contact, and a tunable parameter is introduced to control the preference to
contact through high-weight or low-weight edges. Experimental results on six
real networks show that the epidemic prevalence can be largely promoted when
strong ties are favored in the spreading process. By comparing with two
statistical null models respectively with randomized topology and randomly
redistributed weights, we show that the distribution pattern of weights, rather
than the topology, mainly contributes to the experimental observations. Further
analysis suggests that the weight-weight correlation strongly affects the
results: high-weight edges are more significant in keeping high epidemic
prevalence when the weight-weight correlation is present.

shear for rays passing through anisotropic regions of the cluster. Deviation
from the expected values in a spherically symmetric structure are asymmetric
with respect to path direction and thus will persist as a statistical effect
when averaged over some ensemble of such clusters. The resulting relative
difference in various geometries can be as large as approximately 2%, 8%, and

direct measure of spin and valley mixing, facilitated by spin-orbit interaction
in the presence of non-ideal interfaces. A lower bound of spin dephasing time
of 63 ns is extracted. We also describe a possible experimental evidence of an
unconventional spin-valley blockade, despite the assumption of non-ideal

better control and read-out techniques for the spin qubits in an all CMOS

the model accurately on open cylinders with different boundary conditions. With
increasing J2, we find a Neel phase, a plaquette valence-bond (PVB) phase with
a finite spin gap, and a possible spin liquid in a small region of J2 between
these two phases. From the finite-size scaling of the magnetic order parameter,
we estimate that the Neel order vanishes at J2/J1~0.44. For 0.5<J2/J1<0.61, we
find dimer correlations and PVB textures whose decay lengths grow strongly with
increasing system width, consistent with a long-range PVB order in the
two-dimensional limit. The dimer-dimer correlations reveal the s-wave character
of the PVB order. For 0.44<J2/J1<0.5, spin order, dimer order, and spin gap are
small on finite-size systems and appear to scale to zero with increasing system
width, which is consistent with a possible gapless SL or a near-critical
behavior. We compare and contrast our results with earlier numerical studies.

items. The buyer's valuations towards the two items are independent and
additive. In this setting, optimal mechanism is unknown for general valuation
distributions. We obtain two categories of structural results that shed light
on the optimal mechanisms.
  The first category of results state that, under certain mild condition, the
optimal mechanism has a monotone menu. In other words, in the menu that
represents the optimal mechanism, as payment increases, the allocation
probabilities for both items increase simultaneously. Applying this theorem, we
derive a version of revenue monotonicity theorem that states stochastically
superior distributions yield more revenue. Moreover, our theorem subsumes a
previous result regarding sufficient conditions under which bundling is
optimal. The second category of results state that, under certain conditions,
the optimal mechanisms have few menu items. Our first result in this category
says, for certain distributions, the optimal menu contains at most 4 items. The
condition admits power (including uniform) density functions. Based on a
similar proof of this result, we are able to obtain a wide class of
distributions where bundling is optimal. Our second result in this category
works for a weaker condition, under which the optimal menu contains at most 6
items. This condition includes exponential density functions. Our last result
in this category works for unit-demand setting. It states that, for uniform
distributions, the optimal menu contains at most 5 items. All these results are
in sharp contrast to Hart and Nisan's recent result that finite-sized menu
cannot guarantee any positive fraction of optimal revenue for correlated
valuation distributions.

with the B0->K+pi- decay by replacing the spectator s with d. Under these

cut from the direct CP violation of barB0 to K-pi+, therefore, the deviation
from the SM prediction of C_{K+K-} is not found. On the other hand, the CP

have emerged as important channels for information dissemination. They are
noisy, informal, and surge quickly. Real life events, which may happen and
evolve every minute, are perceived and circulated in post streams by social
users. Intuitively, an event can be viewed as a dense cluster of posts with a
life cycle sharing the same descriptive words. There are many previous works on
event detection from social streams. However, there has been surprisingly
little work on tracking the evolution patterns of events, e.g., birth/death,
growth/decay, merge/split, which we address in this paper. To define a tracking
scope, we use a sliding time window, where old posts disappear and new posts
appear at each moment. Following that, we model a social post stream as an
evolving network, where each social post is a node, and edges between posts are
constructed when the post similarity is above a threshold. We propose a
framework which summarizes the information in the stream within the current
time window as a ``sketch graph'' composed of ``core'' posts. We develop
incremental update algorithms to handle highly dynamic social streams and track
event evolution patterns in real time. Moreover, we visualize events as word
clouds to aid human perception. Our evaluation on a real data set consisting of
5.2 million posts demonstrates that our method can effectively track event
dynamics in the whole life cycle from very large volumes of social streams on

UKIDSS databases, we have attempted to identify galaxies at z ~ 0.5 that are
consistent with their being essentially unmodified examples of the luminous
passive compact galaxies found at z ~ 2.5. After isolating good candidates via
deeper imaging, we further refine the sample with Keck moderate-resolution
spectroscopy and laser-guide-star adaptive-optics imaging. For 4 of the 5
galaxies that so far remain after passing through this sieve, we analyze
plausible star-formation histories based on our spectra in order to identify
galaxies that may have survived with little modification from the population
formed at high redshift. We find 2 galaxies that are consistent with having
formed > 95% of their mass at z > 5. We attempt to estimate masses both from
our stellar population determinations and from velocity dispersions. Given the
high frequency of small axial ratios, both in our small sample and among
samples found at high redshifts, we tentatively suggest that some of the more
extreme examples of passive compact galaxies may have prolate morphologies.

peaked and cusped solitary waves in shallow water. However, it was an open
question whether or not the exact wave equations can admit them in finite water
depth. Besides, it was traditionally believed that cusped solitary waves, whose
1st-derivative tends to infinity at crest, are essentially different from
peaked solitary ones with finite 1st-derivative. Currently, based on the
symmetry and the exact water wave equations, Liao [1] proposed a unified wave
model (UWM) for progressive gravity waves in finite water depth. The UWM admits
not only all traditional smooth progressive waves but also the peaked solitary
waves in finite water depth: in other words, the peaked solitary progressive
waves are consistent with the traditional smooth ones. In this paper, in the
frame of the linearized UWM, we further give, for the first time, the cusped
solitary waves in finite water depth, and besides reveal a close relationship
between the cusped and peaked solitary waves: a cusped solitary wave is consist
of an infinite number of peaked solitary ones with the same phase speed, so
that it can be regarded as a special peaked solitary wave. This also well
explains why and how a cuspon has an infinite 1st-derivative at crest. It is
found that, like peaked solitary waves, the vertical velocity of a cusped
solitary wave in finite water depth is also discontinuous at crest (x=0), and
especially its phase speed has nothing to do with wave height, too. In
addition, it is unnecessary to consider whether the peaked/cusped solitary
waves given by the UWM are weak solution or not, since the governing equation
is not necessary to be satisfied at crest. All of these would deepen and enrich
our understandings about the cusped solitary waves.

  A method is developed to compute analytically entanglement measures of
three-qubit pure states. Owing to it closed-form expressions are presented for
the geometric measure of entanglement for three-qubit states that are linear
combinations of four orthogonal product states. It turns out that the geometric
measure for these states has three different expressions depending on the range
of definition in parameter space and the Hilbert space of three-qubits consists
of three different entangled regions. The states that lie on joint surfaces
separating different entangled regions, designated as shared states, have
particularly interesting features and are dual quantum channels for the perfect
teleportation and superdense coding [42].
  A powerful method is developed to compute analytically multipartite
entanglement measures. The method uses the duality concept and creates a
bijection between highly entangled quantum states and their nearest separable
states. The bijection gives explicitly the geometric entanglement measure of
arbitrary generalized W states of n qubits [30, 75]. Additionaly, the behavior
of the geometric entanglement measure of many-qubit W states is analyzed and an
interpolating formula is derived [51].
  Generalized Schmidt decomposition of pure three-qubit states has four
positive and one complex coefficients. In contrast to the bipartite case, they
are not arbitrary and the largest Schmidt coefficient restricts severely other
coefficients. It is derived a non-strict inequality between three-qubit Schmidt
coefficients, where the largest coefficient defines the least upper bound for
the three nondiagonal coefficients or, equivalently, the three nondiagonal
coefficients together define the greatest lower bound for the largest
coefficient [53].

about the number of components in mixture models. It is often approximated
since the exact form is unavailable. A bias in the approximation may be due to
an incomplete exploration by a simulated Markov chain (e.g., a Gibbs sequence)
of the collection of posterior modes, a phenomenon also known as lack of label
switching, as all possible label permutations must be simulated by a chain in
order to converge and hence overcome the bias. In an importance sampling
approach, imposing label switching to the importance function results in an
exponential increase of the computational cost with the number of components.
In this paper, two importance sampling schemes are proposed through choices for
the importance function; a MLE proposal and a Rao-Blackwellised importance
function. The second scheme is called dual importance sampling. We demonstrate
that this dual importance sampling is a valid estimator of the evidence and
moreover show that the statistical efficiency of estimates increases. To reduce
the induced high demand in computation, the original importance function is
approximated but a suitable approximation can produce an estimate with the same

heterogeneity of receivers by letting the sender choose the block size, divide
a multicast stream into blocks, associate each block with a signature, and
spread the effect of the signature across all the packets in the block through
hash graphs or coding algorithms. The correlation among packets makes them
vulnerable to packet loss, which is inherent in the Internet and wireless
networks. Moreover, the lack of Denial of Service (DoS) resilience renders most
of them vulnerable to packet injection in hostile environments. In this paper,
we propose a novel multicast authentication protocol, namely MABS, including
two schemes. The basic scheme (MABS-B) eliminates the correlation among packets
and thus provides the perfect resilience to packet loss, and it is also
efficient in terms of latency, computation, and communication overhead due to
an efficient cryptographic primitive called batch signature, which supports the
authentication of any number of packets simultaneously.so we discuss their
comparisons and performance evaluation of Packet Loss, Comparisons over Lossy
Channels, Comparisons of Signature Schemes, computationational overheads etc.

be used to produce aperiodic pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) with good
statistical behavior. We introduce the \emph{well distributed occurrences}
(WELLDOC) combinatorial property for infinite words, which guarantees absence
of the lattice structure defect in related pseudorandom number generators. An
infinite word $u$ on a $d$-ary alphabet has the WELLDOC property if, for each
factor $w$ of $u$, positive integer $m$, and vector $\mathbf v\in\mathbb
Z_{m}^{d}$, there is an occurrence of $w$ such that the Parikh vector of the
prefix of $u$ preceding such occurrence is congruent to $\mathbf v$ modulo $m$.
(The Parikh vector of a finite word $v$ over an alphabet $\mathcal A$ has its
$i$-th component equal to the number of occurrences of the $i$-th letter of
$\mathcal A$ in $v$.) We prove that Sturmian words, and more generally
Arnoux-Rauzy words and some morphic images of them, have the WELLDOC property.
Using the TestU01 and PractRand statistical tests, we moreover show that not
only the lattice structure is absent, but also other important properties of
PRNGs are improved when linear congruential generators are combined using
infinite words having the WELLDOC property.

perform a semiclassical analysis, to be regarded as the zeroth-order
approximation of a WKB (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) approximation of the quantum
dynamics, and demonstrate how the features of polymer quantum mechanics are
able to remove the chaotic properties of the Bianchi IX dynamics. Then, we
address the study of the full quantum dynamics of this model in the polymer
representation and analyze the two cases, in which the Bianchi IX spatial
curvature does not affect the wave-packet behavior, as well as the instance,
for which it plays the role of an infinite potential confining the dynamics of
the anisotropic variables. The main development of this analysis consists of
investigating how, differently from the standard canonical quantum evolution,
the high quantum number states are not preserved arbitrarily close to the
cosmological singularity. This property emerges as a consequence, on one hand,
of the no longer chaotic features of the classical dynamics (on which the
Misner analysis is grounded), and, on the other hand, of the impossibility to
remove the quantum effect due to the spatial curvature. In the polymer picture,
the quantum evolution of the Bianchi IX model remains always significantly far
from the semiclassical behavior, as far as both the wave-packet spread and the
occupation quantum numbers are concerned. As a result, from a quantum point of
view, the Mixmaster dynamics loses any predictivity characterization for the
discrete nature of the Universe anisotropy.

image. The dimensionality of the eigenspace is reduced using Principal

principal eigen directions, the variation pattern of the obtained weight vector
is modeled to classify it into different emotions. Owing to the variations of

approximate solution has been proposed and employed in different context.
Recently, the form and a way to compute the exact solution for finite

the approximate solution could be an effective substitute for the exact
solution, and in which regimes this substitution can be performed. Here, we
provide a systematic comparison between the exact and the approximate mKE
solutions for a qubit system when average data from a single observable are
available. We address both mKE estimation of states and weak Hamiltonians, and
compare the two solutions in terms of state fidelity and operator distance. We
find that the approximate solution is generally close to the exact one unless
the initial state is near an eigenstate of the measured observable. Our results
provide a rigorous justification for the use of the approximate solution
whenever the above condition does not occur, and extend its range of
application beyond those situations satisfying the assumptions used for its
derivation.

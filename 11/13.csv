LHC with a mass m_H\simeq 126 GeV, we review different models where the
hierarchy problem is solved by means of a warped extra dimension. In the
Randall-Sundrum model electroweak observables provide very strong bounds on the
mass of KK modes which motivates extensions to overcome this problem. Two
extensions are briefly discussed. One particular extension is based on the
deformation of the metric such that it strongly departs from the AdS_5
structure in the IR region while it goes asymptotically to AdS_5 in the UV
brane. This model has the IR brane close to a naked metric singularity (which
is outside the physical interval) characteristic of soft-walls constructions.
The proximity of the singularity provides a strong wave-function
renormalization for the Higgs field which suppresses the T and S parameters.
The second class of considered extensions are based on the introduction of an
extra gauge group in the bulk such that the custodial SU(2)_R symmetry is
gauged and protects the T parameter. By further enlarging the bulk gauge
symmetry one can find models where the Higgs is identified with the fifth
component of gauge fields and for which the Higgs potential, along with the
Higgs mass, can be dynamically determined by the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism.

goods and n agents with individual, private valuation functions over bundles of

welfare? An important special case is when each agent desires at most one good,
and specifies her (private) value for each good: in this case, the problem is
exactly the maximum-weight matching problem in a bipartite graph.
  Private matching and allocation problems have not been considered in the
differential privacy literature, and for good reason: they are plainly
impossible to solve under differential privacy. Informally, the allocation must
match agents to their preferred goods in order to maximize social welfare, but
this preference is exactly what agents wish to hide. Therefore, we consider the
problem under the relaxed constraint of joint differential privacy: for any
agent i, no coalition of agents excluding i should be able to learn about the
valuation function of agent i. In this setting, the full allocation is no
longer published---instead, each agent is told what good to get. We first show
that with a small number of identical copies of each good, it is possible to
efficiently and accurately solve the maximum weight matching problem while
guaranteeing joint differential privacy. We then consider the more general
allocation problem, when bidder valuations satisfy the gross substitutes
condition. Finally, we prove that the allocation problem cannot be solved to
non-trivial accuracy under joint differential privacy without requiring
multiple copies of each type of good.

K, seen in optical line emission, and diffuse X-ray emitting coronal gas at

strong, empirical correlation between the two gas phases is indicative of a
fundamental relationship between them, though as yet of undetermined cause. The
cooler filaments, originally thought to have condensed from the hot gas, could
also arise from a merger or the disturbance of cool circumnuclear gas by
nuclear activity. Here, we have searched for intrinsic line emission
polarization in cool core galaxy clusters as a diagnostic of fundamental
transport processes. Drawing on developments in solar astrophysics, direct
energetic particle impact induced polarization holds the promise to
definitively determine the role of collisional processes such as thermal
conduction in the ISM physics of galaxy clusters, while providing insight into
other highly anisotropic excitation mechanisms such as shocks, intense
radiation fields and suprathermal particles. Under certain physical conditions,
theoretical calculations predict of order ten percent polarization. Our
observations of the filaments in four nearby cool core clusters place stringent
upper limits (<0.1%) on the presence of emission line polarization, requiring
that if thermal conduction is operative, the thermal gradients are not in the
saturated regime. This limit is consistent with theoretical models of the
thermal structure of filament interfaces.

the MAGIC telescopes during 2011, for the first time in stereoscopic mode. We
combine these measurements with observations at other energy bands: in high
energy (HE, E>100MeV) gamma rays from Fermi-LAT, in X-rays from RXTE, in the
optical from the KVA telescope and in the radio at 43GHz, 37GHz and 15GHz from
the VLBA, Mets\""ahovi and OVRO radio telescopes and optical polarisation
measurements from the KVA and Liverpool telescopes. During the MAGIC
observations (February to April 2011) 3C 279 was in a low state in optical,
X-ray and gamma rays. The MAGIC observations did not yield a significant
detection. These upper limits are in agreement with the extrapolation of the HE
gamma-ray spectrum, corrected for extragalactic background light absorption,
from Fermi-LAT. The second part of the MAGIC observations in 2011 was triggered
by a high activity state in the optical and gamma-ray bands. During the optical
outburst the optical electric vector position angle rotatated of about 180
degrees. There was no simultaneous rotation of the 43GHz radio polarisation
angle. No VHE gamma rays were detected by MAGIC, and the derived upper limits
suggest the presence of a spectral break or curvature between the Fermi-LAT and
MAGIC bands. The combined upper limits are the strongest derived to date for
the source at VHE and below the level of the previously detected flux by a
factor 2. Radiation models that include synchrotron and inverse Compton
emissions match the optical to gamma-ray data, assuming an emission component
inside the broad line region (BLR) responsible for the high-energy emission and
one outside the BLR and the infrared torus causing optical and low-energy
emission. We interpreted the optical polarisation with a bent trajectory model.

node to deliver a rumor to all nodes in an unknown network. We present the
first protocol for any expander graph $G$ with $n$ nodes such that, the
protocol informs every node in $O(\log n)$ rounds with high probability, and
uses $\tilde{O}(\log n)$ random bits in total. The runtime of our protocol is
tight, and the randomness requirement of $\tilde{O}(\log n)$ random bits almost
matches the lower bound of $\Omega(\log n)$ random bits for dense graphs. We
further show that, for many graph families, polylogarithmic number of random
bits in total suffice to spread the rumor in $O(\mathrm{poly}\log n)$ rounds.
These results together give us an almost complete understanding of the
randomness requirement of this fundamental gossip process.
  Our analysis relies on unexpectedly tight connections among gossip processes,
Markov chains, and branching programs. First, we establish a connection between
rumor spreading processes and Markov chains, which is used to approximate the
rumor spreading time by the mixing time of Markov chains. Second, we show a
reduction from rumor spreading processes to branching programs, and this
reduction provides a general framework to derandomize gossip processes. In
addition to designing rumor spreading protocols, these novel techniques may
have applications in studying parallel and multiple random walks, and
randomness complexity of distributed algorithms.

substantial modifications of the abundance of several species. As part of the

program, we aim at investigating the physical and chemical conditions of H20 in
the brightest shock region B1 of the L1157 molecular outflow. We observed
several ortho- and para-H2O transitions using HIFI and PACS instruments on
board Herschel, providing a detailed picture of the kinematics and spatial
distribution of the gas. We performed a LVG analysis to derive the physical
conditions of H2O shocked material, and ultimately obtain its abundance. We
detected 13 H2O lines probing a wide range of excitation conditions. PACS maps
reveal that H2O traces weak and extended emission associated with the outflow
identified also with HIFI in the o-H2O line at 556.9 GHz, and a compact (~10"")
bright, higher-excitation region. The LVG analysis of H2O lines in the
bow-shock show the presence of two gas components with different excitation
conditions: a warm (Tkin~200-300 K) and dense (n(H2)~(1-3)x10^6 cm-3) component
with an assumed extent of 10"" and a compact (~2""-5"") and hot, tenuous
(Tkin~900-1400 K, n(H2)~10^3-10^4 cm-3) gas component, which is needed to
account for the line fluxes of high Eu transitions. The fractional abundance of
the warm and hot H2O gas components is estimated to be (0.7-2)x10^{-6} and
(1-3)x10^{-4}, respectively. Finally, we identified an additional component in
absorption in the HIFI spectra of H2O lines connecting with the ground state
level, probably arising from the photodesorption of icy mantles of a
water-enriched layer at the edges of the cloud.

at z ~ 0.31 in an attempt to disentangle the physical processes responsible for
the transformation of spiral galaxies in clusters. Our sample is selected to
display a dominant young stellar population, as indicated by strong Hdelta
absorption lines in their integrated spectra. Most of our galaxies lack the
[OII] emission line, and hence ongoing star formation. They therefore possess
`k+a' spectra, indicative of a recent truncation of star formation, possibly
preceded by a starburst. Disky `k+a' galaxies are a promising candidate for the
intermediate stage of the transformation from star-forming spiral galaxies to
passive S0s.
  Our observations allow us to study the spatial distributions and the
kinematics of the different stellar populations within the galaxies. We used
three different indicators to evaluate the presence of a young population: the
equivalent width of Hdelta, the luminosity-weighted fraction of A stars, and
the fraction of the galaxy light attributable to simple stellar populations
with ages between 0.5 and 1.5 Gyr. We find a mixture of behaviours, but are
able to show that in most of galaxies the last episode of star-formation
occured in an extended disk, similar to preceeding generations of stars, though
somewhat more centrally concentrated.
  We thus exclude nuclear starbursts and violent gravitational interactions as
causes of the star formation truncation. Gentler mechanisms, such as
ram-pressure stripping or weak galaxy-galaxy interactions, appear to be
responsible for ending star-formation in these intermediate-redshift cluster
disk galaxies.

and machine intelligence; however, its computational complexity limits its
application to truly large scale data analysis. The computational bottleneck in
spectral clustering is computing a few of the top eigenvectors of the
(normalized) Laplacian matrix corresponding to the graph representing the data
to be clustered. One way to speed up the computation of these eigenvectors is
to use the ""power method"" from the numerical linear algebra literature.
Although the power method has been empirically used to speed up spectral
clustering, the theory behind this approach, to the best of our knowledge,
remains unexplored. This paper provides the \emph{first} such rigorous
theoretical justification, arguing that a small number of power iterations
suffices to obtain near-optimal partitionings using the approximate
eigenvectors. Specifically, we prove that solving the $k$-means clustering
problem on the approximate eigenvectors obtained via the power method gives an
additive-error approximation to solving the $k$-means problem on the optimal
eigenvectors.

If $\mathscr X$ is a projective irreducible orbifold of dimension two and

singular perturbation theory. In the second order case we pre- dict that points
furthest from the boundary are selected by the dynamics of the PDE for
singularity. In the fourth order case, singularities can form simultaneously at
multiple locations, even in one spatial dimension. In two spatial dimensions,
the singular perturbation theory reveals that the set of possible singularity
points depends subtly on the geometry of the domain and the equation
parameters. In three spatial dimensions, preliminary numerical simulations
indicate that the multiplicity of singularities can be even more complex. For
the aforementioned scenarios, the analysis highlights the dichotomy of

  University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia PA",,,,"cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most models of social contagion take peer exposure to be a corollary of
adoption, yet in many settings, the visibility of one's adoption behavior
happens through a separate decision process. In online systems, product
designers can define how peer exposure mechanisms work: adoption behaviors can
be shared in a passive, automatic fashion, or occur through explicit, active
sharing. The consequences of these mechanisms are of substantial practical and
theoretical interest: passive sharing may increase total peer exposure but
active sharing may expose higher quality products to peers who are more likely
to adopt.
  We examine selection effects in online sharing through a large-scale field
experiment on Facebook that randomizes whether or not adopters share Offers
(coupons) in a passive manner. We derive and estimate a joint discrete choice
model of adopters' sharing decisions and their peers' adoption decisions. Our
results show that active sharing enables a selection effect that exposes peers
who are more likely to adopt than the population exposed under passive sharing.
  We decompose the selection effect into two distinct mechanisms: active
sharers expose peers to higher quality products, and the peers they share with
are more likely to adopt independently of product quality. Simulation results
show that the user-level mechanism comprises the bulk of the selection effect.
The study's findings are among the first to address downstream peer effects
induced by online sharing mechanisms, and can inform design in settings where a
surplus of sharing could be viewed as costly.

learnable in high dimension. More precisely, we prove that a mixture with known
identical covariance matrices whose number of components is a polynomial of any
fixed degree in the dimension n is polynomially learnable as long as a certain
non-degeneracy condition on the means is satisfied. It turns out that this
condition is generic in the sense of smoothed complexity, as soon as the
dimensionality of the space is high enough. Moreover, we prove that no such
condition can possibly exist in low dimension and the problem of learning the
parameters is generically hard. In contrast, much of the existing work on
Gaussian Mixtures relies on low-dimensional projections and thus hits an
artificial barrier. Our main result on mixture recovery relies on a new
""Poissonization""-based technique, which transforms a mixture of Gaussians to a
linear map of a product distribution. The problem of learning this map can be
efficiently solved using some recent results on tensor decompositions and
Independent Component Analysis (ICA), thus giving an algorithm for recovering
the mixture. In addition, we combine our low-dimensional hardness results for
Gaussian mixtures with Poissonization to show how to embed difficult instances
of low-dimensional Gaussian mixtures into the ICA setting, thus establishing
exponential information-theoretic lower bounds for underdetermined ICA in low
dimension. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such result in the
literature. In addition to contributing to the problem of Gaussian mixture
learning, we believe that this work is among the first steps toward better
understanding the rare phenomenon of the ""blessing of dimensionality"" in the
computational aspects of statistical inference.

combining direct measurements with other observations is crucial to
understanding their origin and propagation. As energetic particles traverse
matter and electromagnetic fields, they leave marks in the form of neutral
interaction products. Among those, gamma rays trace interactions of nuclei that
inelastically collide with interstellar gas, as well as of leptons that undergo
Bremsstrahlung and inverse-Compton scattering. Data collected by the Fermi
Large Area Telescope (LAT) are therefore telling us the story of cosmic rays
along their journey from sources through their home galaxies. Supernova
remnants emerge as a notable gamma-ray source population, and older remnants
interacting with interstellar matter finally show strong evidence of the
presence of accelerated nuclei. Yet the maximum energy attained by shock
accelerators is poorly constrained. Cygnus X, a massive star-forming region
established by the LAT as housing cosmic-ray sources, provides a test case to
study the impact of wind-driven turbulence on the early propagation.
Interstellar emission resulting from the large-scale propagation of cosmic rays
in the Milky Way is revealed in unprecedented detail that challenges some of
the simple assumptions used for the modeling. Moreover, the cosmic-ray induced
gamma-ray luminosities of galaxies scale quasi-linearly with their massive-
star formation rates, and suggests that for most systems a substantial fraction
of energy in cosmic rays escapes into the intergalactic medium. The nuclear
production models and the distribution of target gas and radiation fields, not
determined precisely enough yet, are key to exploiting the full potential of
gamma-ray data. Nevertheless, data being collected by Fermi and complementary
observations are bringing us ever closer to solving the cosmic-ray mystery.

In many

importance in many fields, from economics to biology, from urban planning to
social sciences, to identify the most (or the less) influent nodes in a
network. However, defining the centrality of actors in an interconnected

  In this paper, we capitalize on the tensorial formalism, recently proposed to
characterize and investigate this kind of complex topologies, to show how
several centrality measures -- well-known in the case of standard (""monoplex"")
networks -- can be extended naturally to the realm of interconnected
multiplexes. We consider diagnostics widely used in different fields, e.g.,
computer science, biology, communication and social sciences, to cite only some
of them. We show, both theoretically and numerically, that using the weighted
monoplex obtained by aggregating the multilayer network leads, in general, to
relevant differences in ranking the nodes by their importance.

model of SF with a deterministic low efficiency per free-fall time, as observed
in molecular clouds. Stellar feedback is based on observations of star-forming
regions, and includes radiation pressure from massive stars, photoheating in H
II regions, supernovae and stellar winds. We find that stellar radiation has a
strong effect on the formation of low-mass galaxies, especially at z > 1, where
it efficiently suppresses SF by dispersing cold and dense gas, preventing
runaway growth of the stellar component. This behaviour is evident in a variety
of observations but had so far eluded analytical and numerical models without
radiation feedback. Compared to supernovae alone, radiation feedback reduces
the SF rate by a factor of ~100 at z < 2, yielding rising SF histories which
reproduce recent observations of Local Group dwarfs. Stellar radiation also
produces bulgeless spiral galaxies and may be responsible for excess thickening
of the stellar disc. The galaxies also feature rotation curves and baryon
fractions in excellent agreement with current data. Lastly, the dwarf galaxy
shows a very slow reduction of the central dark matter density caused by
radiation feedback over the last ~7 Gyr of cosmic evolution.

complexity of this type of sampling problem means that its solution is
classically unverifiable within a feasible number of trials, and the task of

  Aims. We to propose a method that allows the characterization of the adopted
C/O ratio in protoplanetary disks independently from the determination of the
host star composition. Titanium and vanadium chemistries are investigated
because they are strong optical absorbers and also because their oxides are
known to be sensitive to the C/O ratio in some exoplanet atmospheres.
  Methods. We use a commercial package based on the Gibbs energy minimization
technique to compute the titanium and vanadium equilibrium chemistries in
protoplanetary disks for C/O ratios ranging from 0.05 to 10. Our calculations
are performed for pressures ranging from 1e-6 to 1e-2 bar, and for temperatures
ranging from 50 to 2000 K.
  Results. We find that the vanadium nitride/vanadium oxide and titanium
hydride/titanium oxide gas phase ratios strongly depend on the C/O ratio in the
hot parts of disks (T > 1000 K). Our calculations suggest that, in these
regions, these ratios can be used as tracers of the C/O value in protoplanetary
disks.

Re-direction of the spin wave packets among the possible trajectories is due to
the interference in the magnetic cross-junctions. Two wave packets coming to

Two packets coming out-of-phase to the junction are completely reflected back.
The operation of the cross-junction is illustrated by numerical modeling. We

  in Diverse Communities",,,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Current theories about mechanisms promoting species co-existence in diverse
communities assume that species only interact ecologically. Species are treated
as discrete evolutionary entities, even though abundant empirical evidence
indicates that patterns of gene flow such as selfing and hybridization
frequently occur in plant and animal groups. Here, we allow mating behavior to
respond to local species composition and abundance in a data-driven
meta-community model of species co-existence. While individuals primarily
out-cross, they also maintain some small capacity for selfing and
hybridization. Mating choice is treated as a 'fuzzy' behavior, determined by an
interaction between intrinsic properties affecting mate choice and extrinsic
properties of the local community, primarily the density and availability of
sympatric inter-fertile species. When mate choice is strongly limited, even low
survivorship of selfed offspring (<10%) can prevent extinction of rare species.
With increasing mate choice, low hybridization success rates (~20%) maintain
community level diversity for substantially longer periods of time. Given the
low species densities and high diversity of tropical tree communities, the
evolutionary costs of competition among sympatric congeneric species are
negligible because direct competition is infrequent. In diverse communities,
many species are chronically rare and thus vulnerable to stochastic extinction,
which occurs rapidly if species are completely reproductively isolated. By
incorporating fuzzy mating behavior into models of species co-existence, a more
realistic understanding of the extinction process can be developed. Fuzzy
mating strategies, potentially an important mechanism for rare species to
escape extinction and gain local adaptations, should be incorporated into
forest management strategies.

  Purpose: This work presents coupled-cluster calculations of infinite
nucleonic matter using modern interactions from chiral effective field theory
(EFT). It assesses the role of correlations beyond particle-particle and
hole-hole ladders, and the role of three-nucleon-forces (3NFs) in nuclear
matter calculations with chiral interactions.
  Methods: This work employs the optimized nucleon-nucleon NN potential NNLOopt
at next-to-next-to leading-order, and presents coupled-cluster computations of
the EoS for symmetric nuclear matter and neutron matter. The coupled-cluster
method employs up to selected triples clusters and the single-particle space
consists of a momentum-space lattice. We compare our results with benchmark
calculations and control finite-size effects and shell oscillations via
twist-averaged boundary conditions.
  Results: We provide several benchmarks to validate the formalism and show
that our results exhibit a good convergence toward the thermodynamic limit.
While neutron matter with interactions from chiral EFT is perturbative,
symmetric nuclear matter requires nonperturbative approaches. Correlations
beyond the standard particle-particle ladder approximation yield non-negligible
contributions. The saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter is sensitive to
the employed 3NFs and the employed regularization scheme. 3NFs with nonlocal
cutoffs exhibit a considerably improved convergence than their local cousins.
We are unable to find values for the parameters of the short-range part of the
local 3NF that simultaneously yield acceptable values for the saturation point
in symmetric nuclear matter and the binding energies of light nuclei.

In this work the simulation setup is introduced and the response of TDGs to
self-consistent star formation (SF) and an external tidal field is examined.
Throughout the simulation star cluster particles with variable masses down to
$5\,M_{\odot}$ form, depending on the local gas reservoir. For low cluster
masses $M_{\mathrm{cl}}$, the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is considered
to be either filled or truncated at a maximal star mass $m_\mathrm{max}$ to
represent the observed $m_{\mathrm{max}} - M_{\mathrm{cl}}$ relation (IGIMF
theory). The evolution of TDGs with fully-populated and truncated IMFs are
compared to study the impact of stellar energy feedback on their survivability.
Both TDGs experience an initial starburst but after a dynamical time they
evolve into dwarf galaxies with self-regulated and continuous SF. At this stage
the truncated-IMF model contains about 6 times more stellar mass than the
invariant IMF models, but the final bound gas mass is comparable in both
models. In spite of their significantly different SF histories, both TDG models
are not disrupted within the first 500 Myr. We conclude that TDGs can survive
an early starburst, independent of the underlying IMF description, even though
they do not harbor a stabilizing dark matter halo.

direct N-body calculations that a very massive binary system can be readily
dynamically ejected from a R136-like cluster, through a close encounter with a
very massive system. One out of four N-body cluster models produces a
dynamically ejected very massive binary system with a mass comparable to R144.
The system has a system mass of $\approx$ 355 Msun and is located at 36.8 pc

(1) What does it mean for a circumbinary system to be dynamically packed? (2)
How many systems are required to differentiate between a population of packed

  Nobel","An Empirical Bayes Approach for Multiple Tissue eQTL Analysis","accepted by Biostatistics",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses, which identify genetic
markers associated with the expression of a gene, are an important tool in the
understanding of diseases in human and other populations. While most eQTL
studies to date consider the connection between genetic variation and
expression in a single tissue, complex, multi-tissue data sets are now being
generated by the GTEx initiative. These data sets have the potential to improve
the findings of single tissue analyses by borrowing strength across tissues,
and the potential to elucidate the genotypic basis of differences between
tissues.
  In this paper we introduce and study a multivariate hierarchical Bayesian
model (MT-eQTL) for multi-tissue eQTL analysis. MT-eQTL directly models the
vector of correlations between expression and genotype across tissues. It
explicitly captures patterns of variation in the presence or absence of eQTLs,
as well as the heterogeneity of effect sizes across tissues. Moreover, the
model is applicable to complex designs in which the set of donors can (i) vary
from tissue to tissue, and (ii) exhibit incomplete overlap between tissues. The
MT-eQTL model is marginally consistent, in the sense that the model for a
subset of tissues can be obtained from the full model via marginalization.
Fitting of the MT-eQTL model is carried out via empirical Bayes, using an
approximate EM algorithm. Inferences concerning eQTL detection and the
configuration of eQTLs across tissues are derived from adaptive thresholding of
local false discovery rates, and maximum a-posteriori estimation, respectively.
We investigate the MT-eQTL model through a simulation study, and rigorously
establish the FDR control of the local FDR testing procedure under mild
assumptions appropriate for dependent data.

about galaxies which intersect the quasar line of sight. They also enable tests
of the variability of fundamental constants over cosmological time and
distance-scales. Key to these endeavours are the laboratory frequencies,
isotopic and hyperfine structures of various metal-ion transitions. Here we
review and synthesize the existing information about these quantities for 43
transitions which are important for measuring possible changes in the
fine-structure constant, alpha, using optical quasar spectra, i.e. those of Na,
Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni and Zn. We also summarize the information
currently missing that precludes more transitions being used. We present an
up-to-date set of coefficients, q, which define the sensitivity of these
transitions to variations in alpha. New calculations of isotopic structures and
q coefficients are performed for SiII and TiII, including SiII 1808 and TiII
1910.6/1910.9 for the first time. Finally, simulated absorption-line spectra
are used to illustrate the systematic errors expected if the isotopic/hyperfine
structures are omitted from profile fitting analyses.
  To ensure transparency, repeatability and currency of the data and
calculations, we supply a comprehensive database as Supporting Information.
This will be updated as new measurements and calculations are performed.

SFR-M* plane up to z~2 using observations from the Herschel Space Observatory.
Starting from a sample of galaxies with reliable star-formation rates (SFRs),
stellar masses (M*) and redshift estimates, we grid the SFR-M* parameter space
in several redshift ranges and estimate the mean Tdust of each SFR-M*-z bin.
Dust temperatures are inferred using the stacked far-infrared flux densities of
our SFR-M*-z bins. At all redshifts, Tdust increases with infrared luminosities
(LIR), specific SFRs (SSFR; i.e., SFR/M*) and distances with respect to the
main sequence (MS) of the SFR-M* plane (i.e.,
D_SSFR_MS=log[SSFR(galaxy)/SSFR_MS(M*,z)]). The Tdust-SSFR and Tdust-D_SSFR_MS
correlations are statistically more significant than the Tdust-LIR one. While
the slopes of these three correlations are redshift-independent, their
normalizations evolve from z=0 and z~2. We convert these results into a recipe
to derive Tdust from SFR, M* and z. The existence of a strong Tdust-D_SSFR_MS
correlation provides us with information on the dust and gas content of
galaxies. (i) The slope of the Tdust-D__SSFR_MS correlation can be explained by
the increase of the star-formation efficiency (SFE; SFR/Mgas) with D_SSFR_MS as
found locally by molecular gas studies. (ii) At fixed D_SSFR_MS, the constant
Tdust observed in galaxies probing large ranges in SFR and M* can be explained
by an increase or decrease of the number of star-forming regions with
comparable SFE enclosed in them. (iii) At high redshift, the normalization
towards hotter temperature of the Tdust-D_SSFR_MS correlation can be explained
by the decrease of the metallicities of galaxies or by the increase of the SFE
of MS galaxies. All these results support the hypothesis that the conditions
prevailing in the star-forming regions of MS and far-above-MS galaxies are
different.

should always require large heads. Small heads should always scale with small
memories. While it was previously concluded that neither of these predictions
was invariably true, the evidence was weak. Brain size also depends on
ventricle size, which can remain large in some survivors of childhood
hydrocephaly, occupying 95% of cranial volume. Yet some of these have normal or

pointing out that the following two categories in SU(3) gauge theories with
fundamental N_f fermions possess an IR fixed point: Large N_f QCD with N_f in
the conformal window (referred as Conformal QCD) and small N_f QCD with N_f out
of the conformal window at temperature T/Tc > 1 (referred as High Temperature
QCD).
  In the conformal theories with an IR cutoff there exists the ""conformal
region'"" together with the confining region and the deconfining region. We
verify numerically on a lattice of the size 16^3 x64 the existence of the
conformal region and the non-trivial Z(3) structure of the vacuum and the
Yukawa-type decay form of meson propagators in the conformal region.
  We stress that High Temperature QCD is intrinsically accompanied with an IR
cutoff. Therefore the understanding the vacuum structure and the property of
correlation functions is the key to resolve long standing issues in High
Temperature QCD.
  We further argue that there is a precise correspondence between Conformal QCD
and High Temperature QCD in the temporal propagators under the change of the
parameters N_f and T/T_c respectively: the one boundary is close to meson
states and the other is close to free quark states.
  In particular, we find the correspondence between Conformal QCD with N_f = 7
and High Temperature QCD with N_f=2 at T ~ 2 Tc being in close relation to a
meson unparticle model. From this we estimate the anomalous mass dimension

(e.g., WiFi access points (AP)s) has attracted considerable attention, as an
efficient and practical method to improve the performance of beyond 4G wireless
networks. In this paper, we propose a novel communication paradigm to satisfy
the performance demands of future wireless networks: a hybrid Cellular/WLAN
network architecture with wireless offloading. In contrast to the commonly
adopted practice of WiFi offloading, where the WLAN APs have a wired backhaul
(e.g., Digital Subscriber Line), we propose a wireless offloading approach,
where the WLAN APs will share their wireless cellular broadband connection with
other users. These users will select their serving node, i.e., the macro-cell
eNodeB or a WLAN AP, based on a certain selection criterion. Thus a challenging
research field is originated, where interfering effects and wireless resources
limitations play a dominant role. Important performance metrics of the proposed
hybrid scheme, including the bit error probability, the ergodic capacity and
the average signal-to-interference-plus noise ratio, are theoretically studied
and closed form expressions are derived for the single-user case with multiple
interferers, for both identical and non-identical fading conditions. Also,
based on the general multi-cellular hybrid WLAN-Cellular concept, we first
propose a intercell interference minimization approach. Then we present a novel
scheme for achieving frequency reuse equal to one within a single macro-cell,
under specific performance criteria and constraints, that guarantee the overall
cell or the individual user QoS requirements.

underlying distribution is a mixture of product distributions over discrete
domains. This problem is motivated by several practical applications such as
crowd-sourcing, recommendation systems, and learning Boolean functions. The
existing solutions either heavily rely on the fact that the number of
components in the mixtures is finite or have sample/time complexity that is
exponential in the number of components. In this paper, we introduce a
polynomial time/sample complexity method for learning a mixture of $r$ discrete
product distributions over $\{1, 2, \dots, \ell\}^n$, for general $\ell$ and
$r$. We show that our approach is statistically consistent and further provide
finite sample guarantees.
  We use techniques from the recent work on tensor decompositions for
higher-order moment matching. A crucial step in these moment matching methods
is to construct a certain matrix and a certain tensor with low-rank spectral
decompositions. These tensors are typically estimated directly from the
samples. The main challenge in learning mixtures of discrete product
distributions is that these low-rank tensors cannot be obtained directly from
the sample moments. Instead, we reduce the tensor estimation problem to: $a$)
estimating a low-rank matrix using only off-diagonal block elements; and $b$)
estimating a tensor using a small number of linear measurements. Leveraging on
recent developments in matrix completion, we give an alternating minimization
based method to estimate the low-rank matrix, and formulate the tensor
completion problem as a least-squares problem.

flexibility (+/- 10 AU) on the inner edge, and the external halo which extends
to ~2000 AU. We measure the disk inclination to be 26 +/- 3 deg from face-on at
a position angle of 64 deg E of N, establishing that the disk is coplanar with
the star and planets. The SED of the disk is well fit by blackbody grains whose
semi-major axes lie within the planetesimal belt, suggesting an absence of
small grains. The wavelength at which the spectrum steepens from blackbody, 47
+/- 30 um, however, is short compared to other A star debris disks, suggesting
that there are atypically small grains likely populating the halo. The PACS

qubit readout: the average-signal (boxcar filter), peak-signal, and
maximum-likelihood methods. In contrast to previous work, we account for a
stochastic turn-on time $t_i$ associated with the leading edge of a pulse
signaling one of the qubit states. This model is relevant to spin-qubit
readouts based on spin-to-charge conversion and would be generically reached in
the limit of large signal-to-noise ratio $r$ for several other physical
systems, including fluorescence-based readouts of ion-trap qubits and
nitrogen-vacancy center spins. We derive analytical closed-form expressions for
the conditional probability distributions associated with the peak-signal and
boxcar filters. For the boxcar filter, we find an asymptotic scaling of the
single-shot error rate $\varepsilon \sim \ln r/\sqrt{r}$ when $t_i$ is
stochastic, in contrast to the result $\varepsilon \sim \ln r/ r$ for
deterministic $t_i$. Consequently, the peak-signal method outperforms the
boxcar filter significantly when $t_i$ is stochastic, but is only marginally
better for deterministic $t_i$ (a result that is consistent with the widespread
use of the boxcar filter for fluorescence-based readouts and the peak-signal
for spin-to-charge conversion). We generalize the theoretically optimal
maximum-likelihood method to stochastic $t_i$ and show numerically that a
stochastic turn-on time $t_i$ will always result in a larger single-shot error
rate. Based on this observation, we propose a general strategy to improve the
quality of single-shot readouts by forcing $t_i$ to be deterministic.

process limit for the Gaussian beta-ensemble. For beta=1, 2 and 4 it gives the
limit of the GOE, GUE and GSE models of random matrix theory. In particular,
for beta=2 it is a determinantal point process conjectured to have similar
behavior to the critical zeros of the Riemann zeta-function. The second process
can be obtained as the bulk scaling limit of the spectrum of certain discrete
one-dimensional random Schr\""odinger operators.
  Both processes have asymptotically constant average density, in our
normalization one expects close to lambda/(2pi) points in a large interval of
length lambda. Our main results are large deviation principles for the average
densities of the processes, essentially we compute the asymptotic probability
of seeing an unusual average density in a large interval. Our approach is based
on the representation of the counting functions of these processes using
stochastic differential equations. We also prove path level large deviation
principles for the arising diffusions.
  Our techniques work for the full range of parameter values. The results are
novel even in the classical beta=1, 2 and 4 cases for the Sine_beta process.
They are consistent with the existing rigorous results on large gap

uses the linearity of the activation function of the output units to simplify
the learning of the output matrix. In this paper, we devise a special technique
that take advantage of this linearity in the output units of an ESN, to learn

their well known difficulty in learning those matrices. Compared to the
technique of BackPropagation Through Time (BPTT) in learning general RNNs, our
proposed method exploits linearity of activation function in the output units

relationships results in the gradient of the cost function having an analytical

instead of obtaining them by recursion as in BPTT. Experimental results on
phone state classification show that learning one or both the input and
recurrent matrices in an ESN yields superior results compared to traditional
ESNs that do not learn these matrices, especially when longer time steps are

fermions. The S-matrix functional realizes a massive extension of the
Cachazo-Svrcek-Witten (CSW) rules in a functional language. Mass-dimension
analysis implies that interactions among gluons and massive fermions should be
decomposed into three-point massive fermion subamplitudes. Namely, such
interactions are represented by combinations of three-point UHV and next-to-UHV
(NUHV) vertices. This feature is qualitatively different from the massive
scalar amplitudes where the number of involving gluons can be arbitrary.

that cover a field of view of 1430 deg^2 centred on Hydra A. The observations
were obtained over three days in 2010 March and three days in 2011 April and
May. The mean cadence of the observations was 26 minutes and there was
additional temporal information on day and year timescales. We explore the
variability of a sample of 105 low frequency radio sources within the field.
Four bright (S > 6 Jy) candidate variable radio sources were identified that
displayed low levels of short timescale variability (26 minutes). We conclude
that this variability is likely caused by simplifications in the calibration
strategy or ionospheric effects. On the timescale of one year we find two
sources that show significant variability. We attribute this variability to
either refractive scintillation or intrinsic variability. No radio transients
were identified and we place an upper limit on the surface density of sources
rho < 7.5 x 10^-5 deg^-2 with flux densities > 5.5 Jy, and characteristic
timescales of both 26 minutes and one year.

determined for each analysis. While there are many threshold selection methods
for univariate extremes, there are relatively few that can be applied in the
multivariate setting. In addition, there are only a few Bayesian-based methods,
which are naturally attractive in the modelling of extremes due to data
scarcity. The use of Bayesian measures of surprise to determine suitable

level of support for the proposed extremal model and threshold, without the
need to specify any model alternatives. This approach is easily implemented for

emergence of universal attractor solutions, which govern the non-equilibrium

close to thermal equilibrium on a time scale $t\sim Q^{-1} \alpha_s^{-7/4}$.

interacting albeit highly anisotropic system at the transition to the
low-occupancy or quantum regime. This evolution in the classical regime is,
within the uncertainties of our simulations, consistent with the ``bottom up''
thermalization scenario~\cite{Baier:2000sb}. While the focus of this paper is
to understand the non-equilibrium dynamics in weak coupling asymptotics, we

holes. These purely imaginary resonances can be expressed in the compact form:
w_n=-i2*pi*T_{BH}*(l+1+n), where T_{BH} is the black-hole temperature, l is the
spheroidal harmonic index of the mode, and n=0,1,2,... is the resonance

particular, it is very hard to construct quantum MDS codes with relatively
large minimum distance. So far, except for some sparse lengths, all known
$q$-ary quantum MDS codes have minimum distance less than or equal to $q/2+1$.
In the present paper, we provide a construction of quantum MDS codes with
minimum distance bigger than $q/2+1$. In particular, we show existence of
$q$-ary quantum MDS codes with length $n=q^2+1$ and minimum distance $d$ for
any $d\le q-1$ and $d= q+1$(this result extends those given in
\cite{Gu11,Jin1,KZ12}); and with length $(q^2+2)/3$ and minimum distance $d$
for any $d\le (2q+2)/3$ if $3|(q+1)$. Our method is through Hermitian
self-orthogonal codes. The main idea of constructing Hermitian self-orthogonal
codes is based on the solvability in $\F_q$ of a system of homogenous equations
over $\F_{q^2}$.

from dwarf irregular to Milky Way-type) in groups and clusters with 10^13 <
M_h/M_sun < 10^15 by using numerical simulations with a new model for
time-varying ram pressure. The long-term evolution of SF rates and H_alpha
morphologies corresponding to the distributions of star-forming regions are
particularly investigated for different model parameters. The principal results
are as follows. Whether ram pressure can enhance or reduce SF depends on M_h of
disk galaxies and inclination angles of gas disks with respect to their orbital
directions for a given orbit and a given environment. For example, SF can be
moderately enhanced in disk galaxies with M_h=10^12 M_sun at the pericenter
passages in a cluster with M_h=10^14 M_sun whereas it can be completely shut
down (`quenching') for low-mass disks with M_h=10^10 M_sun. Ram pressure can
reduce the H_alpha-to-optical-disk-size ratios of disks and the revel of the
reduction depends on M_h and orbits of disk galaxies for a given environment.
Disk galaxies under strong ram pressure show characteristic H_alpha
morphologies such as ring-like, one-sided, and crescent-like distributions.

spectral analyses of high mass stars reveal the presence of high temperature
plasma with temperature <2 keV, and mean L_X/L_{bol} of 10^{-6.9}. In the case
of PMS low mass stars, the plasma temperatures have been found to be in the

difference in plasma temperatures during their evolution from 4 to 46 Myr. The
X-ray luminosity distributions of the PMS low mass stars have been found to be

values for the PMS low mass stars are well correlated with their bolometric
luminosities, that implies its dependence on the internal structure of the low

intermediate mass stars and the PMS low mass stars has not been found to be

an Abelian subgroup of the SU(3) gauge Links. A good way to find the Abelian
component of the field is through the Cho-Guan-De gauge invariant Abelian
Decomposition, which uses a carefully chosen direction vector $n$ to split the
gauge field into an Abelian restricted field and a remnant coloured field. The
restricted field can be further subdivided into topological and non-topological
terms. We show that there is a choice of $n$ which allows us to exactly
represent the Wilson Loop of full QCD as a function of only the restricted
Abelian field without requiring any path ordering or additional path integrals.
We present numerical evidence showing that the topological part of the
restricted field dominates the string tension. We also show that $n$ contains
certain topological objects, which, if they exist, will be at least partially
responsible for confinement. These leave distinctive patterns in the restricted
field strength, and we search for these structures in quenched lattice QCD.

active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Radio power at 1.4 or 5 GHz, which has been used
in many studies, can be affected by synchrotron self-absorption and free-free
absorption in a dense region. On the other hand, these absorption effects get
smaller at higher frequencies. Thus, we performed simultaneous observations at
22 and 43 GHz using the Korean VLBI Network (KVN) radio telescope based on a
sample of 305 AGN candidates residing in elliptical galaxies from the overlap
between the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 and Faint Images of
the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters (FIRST). About 37% and 22% of the galaxies
are detected at 22 and 43 GHz, respectively. Assuming no flux variability
between the FIRST and KVN observation, spectral indices were derived from FIRST
and KVN data and we found that over 70% of the detected galaxies have flat or
inverted spectra, implying the presence of optically thick compact regions near
the centres of the galaxies. Core radio power does not show a clear dependence
on black hole mass at either low (1.4 GHz) or high (22 and 43 GHz) frequencies.
However, we found that the luminosity of the [OIII] $\lambda$5007 emission line
and the Eddington ratio correlate with radio power more closely at high
frequencies than at low frequencies. This suggests that radio observation at
high frequencies can be an appropriate tool for unveiling the innermost region.
In addition, the luminosity of the [OIII] $\lambda$5007 emission line and the
Eddington ratio can be used as a tracer of AGN activity. Our study suggests a
causal connection between high frequency radio power and optical properties of
AGNs.

known. However, it is comparatively easier to define conditions under which a
planet is very likely not habitable. Finding such conditions is important as it
can help select, in an ensemble of potentially observable planets, which ones
should be observed in greater detail for characterization studies. Assuming, as
in the Earth, that the presence of a C-cycle is a necessary condition for
long-term habitability, we derive, as a function of the planetary mass, a
radius above which a planet is likely not habitable. We compute the maximum
radius a planet can have to fulfill two constraints: surface conditions
compatible with the existence of liquid water, and no ice layer at the bottom
of a putative global ocean. We demonstrate that, above a given radius, these
two constraints cannot be met. We compute internal structure models of planets,
using a five-layer model (core, inner mantle, outer mantle, ocean, and
atmosphere), for different masses and composition of the planets (in
particular, the Fe/Si ratio of the planet). Our results show that for planets
in the Super-Earth mass range (1-12 Mearth), the maximum that a planet, with a
composition similar to that of the Earth, can have varies between 1.7 and 2.2
Rearth. This radius is reduced when considering planets with higher Fe/Si
ratios and taking radiation into account when computing the gas envelope
structure. These results can be used to infer, from radius and mass
determinations using high-precision transit observations like those that will
soon be performed by the CHaracterizing ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS), which
planets are very likely not habitable, and therefore which ones should be
considered as best targets for further habitability studies.}

approximation of an equivalent sparse $\ell_0$-minimization reformulation of
the JPAC problem where $q\in(0,1).$ We show that, for any instance of the JPAC
problem, there exists a $\bar q\in(0,1)$ such that it can be exactly solved by
solving its $\ell_q$-minimization approximation problem with any $q\in(0, \bar
q]$. We also show that finding the global solution of the $\ell_q$
approximation problem is NP-hard. Then, we propose a potential reduction
interior-point algorithm, which can return an $\epsilon$-KKT solution of the
NP-hard $\ell_q$-minimization approximation problem in polynomial time. The
returned solution can be used to check the simultaneous supportability of all
links in the network and to guide an iterative link removal procedure,
resulting in the polynomial time non-convex approximation deflation approach
for the JPAC problem. Numerical simulations show that the proposed approach
outperforms the existing convex approximation approaches in terms of the number

quite good performance in selecting which subset of links to support.

within the frequency range of 10 kHz - 50 MHz are investigated for three
different nonlinear coupling strengths between the two lasing modes. In the
theoretical model, we consider two different physical mechanisms responsible
for the RF phase noise. In the low frequency domain (typically below 500 kHz),
the dominant contribution to the RF phase noise is shown to come from the
thermal fluctuations of the semicondutor active medium induced by pump
intensity fluctuations. However, in the higher frequency domain (typically
above 500 kHz), the main source of RF phase noise is shown to be the pump
intensity fluctuations which are transfered to the intensity noises of the two
lasing modes and then to the phase noise via the large Henry factor of the
semiconductor gain medium. For this latter mechanism, the nonlinear coupling
strength between the two lasing modes is shown to play an important role in the
value of the RF phase noise. All experimental results are shown to be in good
agreement with theory.

value distribution to a sample of maxima over blocks extracted from an
underlying series. In asymptotic theory, it is usually postulated that the
block maxima are an independent random sample of an extreme value distribution.
In practice however, block sizes are finite, so that the extreme value
postulate will only hold approximately. A more accurate asymptotic framework is
that of a triangular array of block maxima, the block size depending on the
size of the underlying sample in such a way that both the block size and the
number of blocks within that sample tend to infinity. The copula of the vector
of componentwise maxima in a block is assumed to converge to a limit, which,
under mild conditions, is then necessarily an extreme value copula. Under this
setting and for absolutely regular stationary sequences, the empirical copula
of the sample of vectors of block maxima is shown to be a consistent and
asymptotically normal estimator for the limiting extreme value copula.
Moreover, the empirical copula serves as a basis for rank-based, nonparametric
estimation of the Pickands dependence function of the extreme value copula. The
results are illustrated by theoretical examples and a Monte Carlo simulation
study.

leading contact interaction nonperturbatively, and the rest, including the
long-distance part of pion exchange, are treated as perturbations. To define
the long-distance part, it is important to introduce a separation scale, or a
cutoff. We employ a hybrid regularization, in which the loops with only contact
interactions are regularized with Power Divergence Subtraction (PDS), while the
loops with (long-distance part of) pion exchange are regularized with a
Gaussian damping factor (GDF), to simplify the (nonperturbative) leading-order
amplitudes. The scale introduced by PDS is identified with the cutoff of GDF up
to a numerical factor. We emphasize that the introduction of the GDF requires a
careful definition of the coupling constant for the pion exchange. We obtain
the analytic expressions for the phase shifts for the $^1S_0$ and

by the ROSAT Wide Field Camera implying a large ultrasoft X-ray flux. This soft
X-ray excess is strongly variable on year timescales, a common property of
Narrow Line Seyfert 1s, yet its optical linewidths classify this source as a
broad-lined Seyfert 1. We use four nearly simultaneous optical--X-ray SEDs
spanning 7 years to study the spectral shape and long term variability of RE
J2248-511.
  Here we show that the continuum SED for the brightest epoch dataset is
consistent with the mean SED of a standard quasar, and matches well to that
from an XMM-SDSS sample of AGN with <M/M_Sun> ~ 10^8 and <L/L_Edd> ~ 0.2. All
the correlated optical and soft X-ray variability can be due entirely to a
major absorption event. The only remarkable aspect of this AGN is that there is
no measurable intrinsic X-ray absorption column in the brightest epoch dataset.
The observed FUV flux is determined by the combination of this and the fact
that the source lies within a local absorption `hole'. RE J2248-511, whose
variable, ultrasoft X-ray flux once challenged its BLS1 classification,
demonstrates that characterisation of such objects requires multi-epoch,
multi-wavelength campaigns.

method of choice for the description of phonon spectra of metals and
insulators. The inclusion of anharmonic effects is, however, delicate as it
relies on perturbation theory requiring a considerable amount of computer time,
fast increasing with the cell size. Furthermore, perturbation theory breaks
down when the harmonic solution is dynamically unstable or the anharmonic
correction of the phonon energies is larger than the harmonic frequencies
themselves.We present a stochastic implementation of the self-consistent
harmonic approximation valid to treat anharmonicity at any temperature in the
non-perturbative regime. The method is based on the minimization of the free
energy with respect to a trial density matrix described by an arbitrary
harmonic Hamiltonian. The minimization is performed with respect to all the
free parameters in the trial harmonic Hamiltonian, namely, equilibrium
positions, phonon frequencies and polarization vectors. The gradient of the
free energy is calculated following a stochastic procedure. The method can be
used to calculate thermodynamic properties, dynamical properties and anharmonic
corrections to the Eliashberg function of the electron-phonon coupling. The
scaling with the system size is greatly improved with respect to perturbation
theory. The validity of the method is demonstrated in the strongly anharmonic
palladium and platinum hydrides. In both cases we predict a strong anharmonic
correction to the harmonic phonon spectra, far beyond the perturbative limit.
In palladium hydrides we calculate thermodynamic properties beyond the
quasiharmonic approximation, while in PtH we demonstrate that the high
superconducting critical temperatures at 100 GPa predicted in previous
calculations based on the harmonic approximation are strongly suppressed when
anharmonic effects are included.

for community detection in sparse random graphs drawn from the stochastic block
model. Mossel et al.\cite{Mossel12} established the negative part of the
conjecture, proving impossibility of meaningful detection below the threshold.
However the positive part of the conjecture remained elusive so far. Here we
solve the positive part of the conjecture. We introduce a modified adjacency
matrix $B$ that counts self-avoiding paths of a given length $\ell$ between
pairs of nodes and prove that for logarithmic $\ell$, the leading eigenvectors
of this modified matrix provide non-trivial detection, thereby settling the
conjecture. A key step in the proof consists in establishing a {\em weak
Ramanujan property} of matrix $B$. Namely, the spectrum of $B$ consists in two
leading eigenvalues $\rho(B)$, $\lambda_2$ and $n-2$ eigenvalues of a lower
order $O(n^{\epsilon}\sqrt{\rho(B)})$ for all $\epsilon>0$, $\rho(B)$ denoting
$B$'s spectral radius. $d$-regular graphs are Ramanujan when their second
eigenvalue verifies $|\lambda|\le 2 \sqrt{d-1}$. Random $d$-regular graphs have
a second largest eigenvalue $\lambda$ of $2\sqrt{d-1}+o(1)$ (see
Friedman\cite{friedman08}), thus being {\em almost} Ramanujan.
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs with average degree $d$ at least logarithmic
($d=\Omega(\log n)$) have a second eigenvalue of $O(\sqrt{d})$ (see Feige and
Ofek\cite{Feige05}), a slightly weaker version of the Ramanujan property.
However this spectrum separation property fails for sparse ($d=O(1)$)
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs. Our result thus shows that by constructing matrix $B$
through neighborhood expansion, we regularize the original adjacency matrix to
eventually recover a weak form of the Ramanujan property.

assigned task and try to optimize over secondary aspects of plan execution such
time lapse or power consumption, technically displaying a quasi-dichotomous
preference relation. Boolean games have been developed as a paradigm for
modelling societies of agents with this type of preference. In boolean games
agents exercise control over propositional variables and strive to achieve a
goal formula whose realization might require the opponents' cooperation.
Recently, a theory of incentive engineering for such games has been devised,
where an external authority steers the outcome of the game towards certain
desirable properties consistent with players' goals, by imposing a taxation
mechanism on the players that makes the outcomes that do not comply with those
properties less appealing to them. The present contribution stems from a
complementary perspective and studies, instead, how games with
quasi-dichotomous preferences can be transformed from inside, rather than from
outside, by endowing players with the possibility of sacrificing a part of
their payoff received at a certain outcome in order to convince other players
to play a certain strategy. Concretely we explore the properties of endogenous
games with goals, obtained coupling strategic games with goals, a
generalization of boolean games, with the machinery of endogenous games coming
from game theory. We analyze equilibria in those structures, showing the
preconditions needed for desirable outcomes to be achieved without external
intervention. What our results show is that endogenous games with goals display
specific irreducible features - with respect to what already known for
endogenous games - which makes them worth studying in their own sake.

well-known. In the last few decades a lot of effort has been focused on
understanding how climate phenomena in one geographical region affects the
climate of other regions. Complex networks are a powerful framework for
identifying climate interdependencies. To further exploit the knowledge of the
links uncovered via the network analysis (for, e.g., improvements in
prediction), a good understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying these
links is required. Here we focus in understanding the role of atmospheric
variability, and construct climate networks representing internal and forced
variability. In the connectivity of these networks we assess the influence of
two main indices, NINO3.4 and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), by
calculating the networks from time-series where these indices were linearly
removed. We find that the connectivity of the forced variability network is
heavily affected by ``El Ni\~no'': removing the NINO3.4 index yields a general
loss of connectivity; even teleconnections between regions far away from the
equatorial Pacific ocean are lost, suggesting that these regions are not
directly linked, but rather, are indirectly interconnected via ``El Ni\~no'',
particularly on interannual time scales. On the contrary, in the internal
variability network (independent of sea surface temperature forcing) we find
that the links are significantly affected by NAO with a maximum in intra-annual
time scales. While the strongest non-local links found are those forced by the
ocean, we show that there are also strong teleconnections due to internal
atmospheric variability.

micro-instabilities in stellarators, with an emphasis on trapped-particle
modes. It is found that, in so-called maximum-$J$ configurations,
trapped-particle instabilities are absent in large regions of parameter space.
Quasi-isodynamic stellarators have this property (approximately), and the
theory predicts that trapped electrons are stabilizing to all eigenmodes with
frequencies below the electron bounce frequency. The physical reason is that
the bounce-averaged curvature is favorable for all orbits, and that trapped
electrons precess in the direction opposite to that in which drift waves
propagate, thus precluding wave-particle resonance. These considerations only
depend on the electrostatic energy balance, and are independent of all
geometric properties of the magnetic field other than the maximum-$J$
condition. However, if the aspect ratio is large and the instability phase
velocity differs greatly from the electron and ion thermal speeds, it is
possible to derive a variational form for the frequency showing that stability
prevails in a yet larger part of parameter space than what follows from the
energy argument. Collisionless trapped-electron modes should therefore be more
stable in quasi-isodynamic stellarators than in tokamaks.

In spite of the lack of direct observations, it may not be premature to
speculate on exoplanetary climates, for instance to optimize future telescopic
observations, or to assess the probability of habitable worlds. To first order,
climate primarily depends on 1) The atmospheric composition and the volatile
inventory; 2) The incident stellar flux; 3) The tidal evolution of the
planetary spin, which can notably lock a planet with a permanent night side.
The atmospheric composition and mass depends on complex processes which are
difficult to model: origins of volatile, atmospheric escape, geochemistry,
photochemistry. We discuss physical constraints which can help us to speculate
on the possible type of atmosphere, depending on the planet size, its final
distance for its star and the star type. Assuming that the atmosphere is known,
the possible climates can be explored using Global Climate Models analogous to
the ones developed to simulate the Earth as well as the other telluric
atmospheres in the solar system. Our experience with Mars, Titan and Venus
suggests that realistic climate simulators can be developed by combining
components like a ""dynamical core"", a radiative transfer solver, a
parametrisation of subgrid-scale turbulence and convection, a thermal ground
model, and a volatile phase change code. On this basis, we can aspire to build
reliable climate predictors for exoplanets. However, whatever the accuracy of
the models, predicting the actual climate regime on a specific planet will
remain challenging because climate systems are affected by strong positive
destabilizing feedbacks (such as runaway glaciations and runaway greenhouse
effect). They can drive planets with very similar forcing and volatile
inventory to completely different states.

friction the internal dynamics of the superfluid component becomes more
important compared to the damping and coupling effects from the normal
component. This causes profound changes in superfluid dynamics: the
temperature-dependent transition from laminar to turbulent vortex motion and
the decoupling from the reference frame of the container at even lower
temperatures.

characters from some alphabet A. We initialize c tables h_0, ..., h_{c-1}
mapping characters to random hash values. A key x=(x_0, ..., x_{c-1}) is hashed
to h_0[x_0] xor...xor h_{c-1}[x_{c-1}]. The scheme is extremely fast when the
character hash tables h_i are in cache. Simple tabulation hashing is not
4-independent, but we show that if we apply it twice, then we get high
independence. First we hash to intermediate keys that are 6 times longer than
the original keys, and then we hash the intermediate keys to the final hash
values.
  The intermediate keys have d=6c characters from A. We can view the hash
function as a degree d bipartite graph with keys on one side, each with edges
to d output characters. We show that this graph has nice expansion properties,
and from that we get that with another level of simple tabulation on the
intermediate keys, the composition is a highly independent hash function. The
independence we get is |A|^{Omega(1/c)}.
  Our space is O(c|A|) and the hash function is evaluated in O(c) time. Siegel
[FOCS'89, SICOMP'04] proved that with this space, if the hash function is
evaluated in o(c) time, then the independence can only be o(c), so our
evaluation time is best possible for Omega(c) independence---our independence
is much higher if c=|A|^{o(1)}.
  Siegel used O(c)^c evaluation time to get the same independence with similar
space. Siegel's main focus was c=O(1), but we are exponentially faster when
c=omega(1).
  Applying our scheme recursively, we can increase our independence to
|A|^{Omega(1)} with o(c^{log c}) evaluation time. Compared with Siegel's scheme
this is both faster and higher independence.
  Our scheme is easy to implement, and it does provide realistic
implementations of 100-independent hashing for, say, 32 and 64-bit keys.

the many degrees of freedom in the magnetic geometry. It has recently been
found that certain stellarators (quasi-isodynamic ones with maximum-$J$
geometry) are partly resilient to trapped-particle instabilities, because
fast-bouncing particles tend to extract energy from these modes near marginal
stability. In reality, stellarators are never perfectly quasi-isodynamic, and
the question thus arises whether they still benefit from enhanced stability.
Here the stability properties of Wendelstein 7-X and a more quasi-isodynamic
configuration, QIPC, are investigated numerically and compared with the
National Compact Stellarator Experiment (NCSX) and the DIII-D tokamak. In
gyrokinetic simulations, performed with the gyrokinetic code GENE in the
electrostatic and collisionless approximation, ion-temperature-gradient modes,
trapped-electron modes and mixed-type instabilities are studied. Wendelstein
7-X and QIPC exhibit significantly reduced growth rates for all simulations
that include kinetic electrons, and the latter are indeed found to be
stabilizing in the energy budget. These results suggest that imperfectly
optimized stellarators can retain most of the stabilizing properties predicted
for perfect maximum-$J$ configurations.

sections, in the framework of the nonperturbative approach to soft high-energy
scattering based on Wilson-loop correlation functions, if certain nontrivial
analyticity assumptions are satisfied. The total cross sections turn out to be
of ""Froissart"" type, $\sigma_{\rm tot}^{(hh)}(s) \mathop\sim B\log^2 s$ for ${s
\to
  \infty}$. We also discuss under which conditions the coefficient $B$ is
universal, i.e., independent of the hadrons involved in the scattering process.
In the most natural scenarios for universality, $B$ can be related to the
stable spectrum of QCD, and is predicted to be $B_{\rm th}\simeq 0.22~{\rm
mb}$, in fair agreement with experimental results. If we consider, instead, the
stable spectrum of the quenched (i.e., pure-gauge) theory, we obtain a quite
larger value $B^{(Q)}_{\rm th} \ge 0.42~{\rm mb}$, suggesting (quite
surprisingly) large unquenching effects due to the sea quarks.

optimizes PNC with respect to the maximization of the minimum rate among users.
The proposed strategy maximizes the sum rate of the users allowing nonsymmetric

Efficient coalition formation algorithms are proposed, which perform joint

arcmin field in 3 different colour bands (u, g and r). Each camera is based on
a very large frame-transfer detector (CCD42-C0) of 2kx6k pixels, specially
designed for rapid time-series photometry. These CCDs were originally developed
by e2v for ESA's cancelled Eddington space mission and are now on permanent
loan to the Institute of Astronomy of the KU Leuven, Belgium. The acquisition
system of MAIA uses a single ARC GEN-III controller, custom programmed to allow
differing exposure times for each of the three CCDs. Predefined sequences
synchronize each read-out with the shortest integration time. Detectors that
are not read-out at the end of an exposure continue integrating and can be
read-out in one of the subsequent cycles. This read method takes full advantage
of the frame-transfer functionality of the CCD42-C0 detectors and allows
optimisation of the exposure times for each wavelength band. This then gives a
similar exposure depth in each of the 3 arms despite the fact that the UV
channel typically sees much less flux. We present the CCD42-C0 detectors, their
characterisation, including a thorough analysis of their non-linearity, and the
MAIA data-acquisition system.

accountability mechanism, exit proxy nodes risk sanctions by law enforcement if
users commit illegal actions through the AC network. We present BackRef, a
generic mechanism for AC networks that provides practical repudiation for the
proxy nodes by tracing back the selected outbound traffic to the predecessor
node (but not in the forward direction) through a cryptographically verifiable
chain. It also provides an option for full (or partial) traceability back to
the entry node or even to the corresponding user when all intermediate nodes
are cooperating. Moreover, to maintain a good balance between anonymity and
accountability, the protocol incorporates whitelist directories at exit proxy
nodes. BackRef offers improved deployability over the related work, and
introduces a novel concept of pseudonymous signatures that may be of
independent interest.
  We exemplify the utility of BackRef by integrating it into the onion routing

system-level aspects. We also present the security definitions for the BackRef
system (namely, anonymity, backward traceability, no forward traceability, and

testing theories of gravity. Recent work has reinvigorated the study of
bimetric theories of gravity and massive gravity theories. One of the most
interesting predictions of these theories, as well as some string theories, is
the subluminal speed of propagating gravitational waves. Multi-messenger
astronomy provides a unique opportunity to put limits on the difference (either
positive or negative) between the propagation speed of electromagnetic and
gravitational waves from these sources. This paper considers limits from
multi-messenger cases across the planned measurable spectrum: first, the limits
from isolated pulsars based on the current best limits from LIGO on
gravitational wave emission, second, the limits from ultra-compact binaries
that will be visible to a low-frequency space-based gravitational wave
observatory like LISA, and third, limits from super massive black hole binaries
using pulsar timing arrays. The required phase comparison between the
electromagnetic signal and the gravitational wave signal is derived and,
assuming a null result in that comparison, the current bounds on emission are
used to place limits on alternative theories that exhibit propagation delays.
Observations of the pulsars in the most sensitive range of LIGO could put an
upper limit on the graviton mass as low as $10^{-38}\frac{eV}{c^{2}}$ and an
upper limit on the fractional difference between the gravitational wave and
electromagnetic wave speeds as low as $10^{-9}$. This paper shows results from
the initial LIGO limit catalog of known pulsars. The bounds are stronger for
binaries. A LISA-like mission bounds $m_{g}<10^{-40}\frac{eV}{c^{2}}$ and
$\delta<10^{-12}$. A PTA source gives even better bounds of
$m_{g}<10^{-45}\frac{eV}{c^{2}}$ and $\delta<10^{-14}$.

poly-logarithmic factors, as demonstrated by the Private Multiplicative Weights
algorithm (Hardt and Rothblum, FOCS'10). In particular, our lower bound is the
first to show that the sample complexity required for accuracy and
$(\varepsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy is asymptotically larger than what
is required merely for accuracy, which is $O(\log |\mathcal{Q}| / \alpha^2)$.

formalised as the k-local Hamiltonian problem, which is the natural quantum
analogue of classical constraint satisfaction problems. One way of making the
problem more physically meaningful is to restrict the Hamiltonian in question
by picking its terms from a fixed set S. Examples of such special cases are the
Heisenberg and Ising models from condensed-matter physics.
  In this work we characterise the complexity of this problem for all 2-local
qubit Hamiltonians. Depending on the subset S, the problem falls into one of
the following categories: in P; NP-complete; polynomial-time equivalent to the
Ising model with transverse magnetic fields; or QMA-complete. The third of
these classes has been shown to be StoqMA-complete by Bravyi and Hastings. The
characterisation holds even if S does not contain any 1-local terms; for
example, we prove for the first time QMA-completeness of the Heisenberg and XY
interactions in this setting. If S is assumed to contain all 1-local terms,
which is the setting considered by previous work, we have a characterisation
that goes beyond 2-local interactions: for any constant k, all k-local qubit
Hamiltonians whose terms are picked from a fixed set S correspond to problems
either in P; polynomial-time equivalent to the Ising model with transverse

stellar mass aggregation and galaxy merger histories of central galaxies by
using empirical stellar-to-halo and stellar-to-gas mass relations. The growth
of bulges driven by the galaxy mergers/interactions is calculated using
dynamical prescriptions. The predicted bulge demographics at redshift z~0 is
consistent with observations (Zavala+2012). Here we present the evolution of
the morphological mix (traced by the bulge-to-total mass ratio, B/T) as a
function of mass up to z=3. This mix remains qualitatively the same up to z~1:
B/T<0.1 galaxies dominate at low masses, 0.1<B/T<0.45 at intermediate masses,
and B/T>0.45 at large masses. At z>1, the fractions of disc-dominated and
bulgeless galaxies increase strongly, and by z~2 the era of pure disc galaxies
is reached. Bulge-dominated galaxies acquire such a morphology, and most of
their mass, following a downsizing trend. Since our results are consistent with
most of the recent observational studies of the morphological mix at different
redshifts, a LCDM-based scenario of merger-driven bulge assembly does not seem
to face critical issues. However, if the stellar-to-halo mass relation changes
too little with redshift, then some tensions with observations appear.

a series of hypothetical compounds PbTiO3-xSx x = 0.2, 0.25, 0.33, 0.5, 1, 2,

that replacing the apical oxygen atom in the PTO tetragonal unit cell with a
sulfur atom reduces the x = 0 LDA calculated band gap of 1.47 eV to 0.43 - 0.67
eV for x = 0.2 - 1 and increases the polarization. PBE0 and GW methods predict
that the hypothetical compositions x = 0.2 to x = 2 will have band gaps in the
visible range. For all values of x < 2, the oxysulfide perovskite retains the
tetragonal phase of PbTiO3, and the a-lattice parameter remains within 2.5% of
the oxide. Thermodynamic analysis indicates that chemical routes using high
temperature gas, such as H2S and CS2, can be used to substitute O for S in PTO

suppression of the chiral condensate by an external magnetic field in QCD
around the critical temperature. We show that this effect, seen in lattice

find that the suppression of the condensate happens because the quark
determinant can suppress low quark modes by ordering the Polyakov loop. This
mechanism is particularly efficient around $T_c$ where the Polyakov loop
effective potential is flat and the determinant can have a significant ordering
effect. Our picture suggests that for the description of QCD in large magnetic
fields it is crucial to properly capture the interaction between the Polyakov

exactly when the attractive scalar and repulsive vector potentials have the

guarantee service quality even when traffic is saturated, however, it results
in significant costs to other road users. Partial tram priority significantly
reduces tram delays while having limited impact on other traffic, and therefore
achieves a better result in terms of the overall network performance. We also

(i.e., online social networks and peer-to-peer networks), little attention has
been given to develop a formal methodology to characterize the vast amount of
content distributed over these networks. Due to the large scale nature of these
networks, exhaustive enumeration of this content is computationally
prohibitive. In this paper, we show how one can obtain content properties by
sampling only a small fraction of vertices. We first show that when sampling is
naively applied, this can produce a huge bias in content statistics (i.e.,
average number of content duplications). To remove this bias, one may use
maximum likelihood estimation to estimate content characteristics. However our
experimental results show that one needs to sample most vertices in the graph
to obtain accurate statistics using such a method. To address this challenge,
we propose two efficient estimators: special copy estimator (SCE) and weighted
copy estimator (WCE) to measure content characteristics using available
information in sampled contents. SCE uses the special content copy indicator to
compute the estimate, while WCE derives the estimate based on meta-information
in sampled vertices. We perform experiments to show WCE and SCE are cost
effective and also ``{\em asymptotically unbiased}''. Our methodology provides
a new tool for researchers to efficiently query content distributed in large
scale networks.

considered. First, we address the LZ problem when one or both levels decay,
i.e., $\veps_j(t) \to \veps_j(t)-i \Gamma_j/2$. We find that if the system
evolves from an initial time $-T$ to a final time $+T$ such that $|\veps_1(\pm
T)-\veps_2(\pm T)|$ is not too large, the LZ survival probability of a state $|
j \ra$ can {\em increase} with increasing decay rate of the other state $|i \ne
j \ra$. This surprising result occurs because the decay results in crossing of
the two eigenvalues of the instantaneous non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. On the
other hand, if $|\veps_1(\pm T)-\veps_2(\pm T)| \to \infty$ as $T \to \infty$,
the probability is {\em independent} of the decay rate. These results are based
on analytic solutions of the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equations for two
cases: (a) the energy levels depend linearly on time, and (b) the energy levels
are bounded and of the form $\veps_{1,2}(t) = \pm \veps \tanh (t/{\cal T})$.
Second, we study LZ transitions affected by dephasing by formulating the
Landau--Zener problem with noise in terms of a Schr\""{o}dinger-Langevin
stochastic coupled set of differential equations. The LZ survival probability
then becomes a random variable whose probability distribution is shown to
behave very differently for long and short dephasing times. We also discuss the
combined effects of decay and dephasing on the LZ probability.

polynomials shown by Green and Tao (Contrib. Discrete Math. 2009) and by
Kaufman and Lovett (FOCS 2008) modify a given collection of polynomials \calF =
{P_1,...,P_m} to a new collection \calF' so that the polynomials in \calF' are
""pseudorandom"". These lemmas have various applications, such as (special cases)
of Reed-Muller testing and worst-case to average-case reductions for
polynomials. However, the transformation from \calF to \calF' is not
algorithmic for either regularity lemma. We define new notions of regularity
for polynomials, which are analogous to the above, but which allow for an
efficient algorithm to compute the pseudorandom collection \calF'. In
particular, when the field is of high characteristic, in polynomial time, we
can refine \calF into \calF' where every nonzero linear combination of
polynomials in \calF' has desirably small Gowers norm.
  Using the algorithmic regularity lemmas, we show that if a polynomial P of
degree d is within (normalized) Hamming distance 1-1/|F| -\eps of some unknown
polynomial of degree k over a prime field F (for k < d < |F|), then there is an
efficient algorithm for finding a degree-k polynomial Q, which is within
distance 1-1/|F| -\eta of P, for some \eta depending on \eps. This can be
thought of as decoding the Reed-Muller code of order k beyond the list decoding
radius (finding one close codeword), when the received word P itself is a
polynomial of degree d (with k < d < |F|).
  We also obtain an algorithmic version of the worst-case to average-case
reductions by Kaufman and Lovett. They show that if a polynomial of degree d
can be weakly approximated by a polynomial of lower degree, then it can be
computed exactly using a collection of polynomials of degree at most d-1. We
give an efficient (randomized) algorithm to find this collection.

of interest occurring in an environment. Various methods and approaches have
been proposed in order to track one or more targets in a pre-defined area.
Usually, this turns out to be a complicated job involving higher order

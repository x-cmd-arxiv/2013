using $C$, $X$ & $K$ bands are smaller than the expected values for optically

dominates over synchrotron cooling process. We therefore model the radio
emission as synchrotron emission from a relativistic electron population with a
high energy cutoff. The cutoff is determined by comparing the electron cooling

noise. Our methodology is based on the maximization of the penalized likelihood
where the system of differential equations is used as a penalty. To do so, we
use a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space approach that allows to formulate the
estimation problem as an unconstrained numeric maximization problem easy to
solve. The proposed method is tested with synthetically simulated data and it
is used to estimate the unobserved transcription factor CdaR in Steptomyes
coelicolor using gene expression data of the genes it regulates.

the effect of model error from unresolved scales. In particular, connection to
related subjects under different names in applied mathematics, such as the
Mori-Zwanzig formalism and the averaging method, were discussed with the hope
that the existing methods can be more accessible and eventually be used
appropriately. We will classify existing methods into two groups: the
statistical methods for those who directly estimate the low-order model error
statistics; and the stochastic parameterizations for those who implicitly
estimate all statistics by imposing stochastic models beyond the traditional
unbiased white noise Gaussian processes. We will provide theory to justify why
stochastic parameterization, as one of the main theme in this book, is an
adequate tool for mitigating model error in data assimilation. Finally, we will
also discuss challenges in lifting this approach in general applications and
provide an alternative nonparametric approach.

of two annular endcaps, each with four stations of silicon mini-strip sensors,
covering a rapidity range of $1.2<|\eta|<2.2$ that closely matches the two
existing PHENIX muon arms. Each station consists of 48 individual silicon

in the radial direction and lengths in the $\phi$ direction varying from 3.4 mm
at the inner radius to 11.5 mm at the outer radius. The FVTX has approximately
0.54 million strips in each endcap. These are read out with FPHX chips,
developed in collaboration with Fermilab, which are wire bonded directly to the
mini-strips. The maximum strip occupancy reached in central Au-Au collisions is

group we formulate the duality for general abelian orbifolds of the SU(N), N=4
super Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions, which have fields in the
bi-fundamental representation, and use it to construct explicitly complete
four-vector and four-scalar amplitudes at one loop. For fixed number of
supercharges, graph-organized L-loop n-point integrands of all orbifold
theories are given in terms of a fixed set of polynomials labeled by L
representations of the orbifold group. In contrast to the standard
duality-satisfying presentation of amplitudes of the N=4 super Yang-Mills
theory, each graph may appear several times with different internal states. The
color and R-charge flow provide a way to deform the amplitudes of orbifold
theories to those of more general quiver gauge theories which do not
necessarily exhibit color/kinematics duality on their own. Based on the
organization of amplitudes required by the duality between color and kinematics
in orbifold theories we show how the amplitudes of certain non-factorized
matter-coupled supergravity theories can be found through a double-copy
construction. We also carry out a comprehensive search for theories with fields
solely in the adjoint representation of the gauge group and amplitudes
exhibiting color/kinematics duality for all external states and find an
interesting relation between supersymmetry and existence of the duality.

(known as graph states) can be used for measurement based quantum computation
(MBQC) recently gave rise to the notion of Flow and its generalisation gFlow.
That is a causal structure for measurements guaranteeing deterministic
computation. Furthermore, gFlow has proven itself to be a powerful tool in
studying the difference between the measurement-based and circuit models for
quantum computing, as well as analysing cryptographic protocols. On the other
hand, entanglement is known to play a crucial role in MBQC. In this paper we
first show how gFlow can be used to directly give a bound on the classical
simulation of an MBQC. Our method offers an interpretation of the gFlow as
showing how information flows through a computation, giving rise to an
information light cone. We then establish a link between entanglement and the
existence of gFlow for a graph state. We show that the gFlow can be used to
bound the entanglement width and what we call the \emph{structural
entanglement} of a graph state. In turn this gives another method relating the
gFlow to bounds on how efficiently a computation can be simulated classically.
These two methods of getting bounds on the difficulty of classical simulation
are different and complementary and several known results follow. In particular
known relations between the MBQC and the circuit model allow these results to
be translated across models.

primary transit duration, interfere with the transit modeling. Therefore our
main goal is to study the pulsation spectrum of the host star to redetermine
the orbital parameters of the system by means of pulsation-cleaned primary
transit light curves. Between August 2010 and October 2012 we obtained 457
hours of photometry of WASP-33 using small and middle-class telescopes located
mostly in Spain and in Germany. Our observations comprise the wavelength range
between the blue and the red, and provide full phase coverage of the planetary
orbit. After a careful detrend, we focus our pulsation studies in the high
frequency regime, where the pulsations that mostly deform the primary transit
exist. The data allow us to identify, for the first time in the system, eight
significant pulsation frequencies. The pulsations are likely associated with
low-order p-modes. Furthermore, we find that pulsation phases evolve in time.
We use our knowledge of the pulsations to clean the primary transit light
curves and carry out an improved transit modeling. Surprisingly, taking into
account the pulsations in the modeling has little influence on the derived
orbital parameters. However, the uncertainties in the best-fit parameters
decrease. Additionally, we find indications for a possible dependence between
wavelength and transit depth, but only with marginal significance. A clear
pulsation solution, in combination with an accurate orbital period, allows us
to extend our studies and search for star-planet interactions (SPI). Although
we find no conclusive evidence of SPI, we believe that the pulsation nature of
the host star and the proximity between members make WASP-33 a promising system

systems that are the current focus of radial velocity surveys. However, the
detection of planets around young stars is hampered by the increased stellar
activity associated with young stars, the signatures of which can bias the
detection of planets. In this paper we place realistic limitations on the
possibilities for detecting planets around young active G and K dwarfs. The
models of stellar activity based on tomographic imaging of the G dwarf HD
141943 and the K1 dwarf AB Dor and also include contributions from plage and
many small random starspots. Our results show that the increased stellar
activity levels present on young Solar-type stars strongly impacts the
detection of Earth-mass and Jupiter mass planets and that the degree of
activity jitter is directly correlated with stellar \vsinis. We also show that
for G and K dwarfs, the distribution of activity in individual stars is more
important than the differences in induced radial velocities as a function of
spectral type. We conclude that Jupiter mass planets can be detected close-in
around fast-rotating young active stars, Neptune-mass planets around moderate
rotators and that Super-Earths are only detectable around very slowly rotating
stars. The effects of an increase in stellar activity jitter by observing
younger stars can be compensated for by extending the observational base-line

large introductory classes, first-year, second-semester mechanics, and
second-year introductory E&M, enrolling approximately 500 and 250 students
respectively, introduced ILS into some sections of each class. The specific ILS
utilized were Think-Pair-Share questions and Peer Instruction in the main
lecture classrooms, and UW Tutorials for Introductory Physics in recitation
sections. Pre- and post-instruction assessments (FCI and CSEM respectively)
were given, along with a series of demographics questions. We were able to
compare the results of the FCI and CSEM between interactive and non-interactive
classes taught simultaneously with the same curriculum. We also analyzed final
exam results, as well as the results of student and instructor attitude surveys
between classes. In our analysis, we argue that Multiple Linear Regression
modeling is superior to other common analysis tools, including normalized gain.
Our results show that ILS are effective at improving student learning by all
measures used: research-validated concept inventories and final exam scores, on
both conceptual and traditional problem-solving questions. Multiple Linear
Regression analysis reveals that interactivity in the classroom is a
significant predictor of student learning, showing a similar or stronger
relationship with student learning than such ascribed characteristics as
parents' education, and achieved characteristics such as GPA and hours studied
per week. Analysis of student and instructors attitudes shows that both groups
believe that ILS improve student learning in the physics classroom, and
increases student engagement and motivation.

metric $(V,d)$ where each vertex $v$ has a job with deterministic reward and
random processing time (drawn from a known distribution). The processing times
are independent across vertices. The goal is to obtain a non-anticipatory
policy to run jobs at different vertices, that maximizes expected reward,
subject to the total distance traveled plus processing times being at most $B$.
An adaptive policy is one that can choose the next vertex to visit based on
observed random instantiations. Whereas, a non-adaptive policy is just given by
a fixed ordering of vertices. The adaptivity gap is the worst-case ratio of the
expected rewards of the optimal adaptive and non-adaptive policies.
  We prove an $\Omega(\log\log B)^{1/2}$ lower bound on the adaptivity gap of
stochastic orienteering. This provides a negative answer to the $O(1)$
adaptivity gap conjectured earlier, and comes close to the $O(\log\log B)$
upper bound. This result holds even on a line metric.
  We also show an $O(\log\log B)$ upper bound on the adaptivity gap for the
correlated stochastic orienteering problem, where the reward of each job is
random and possibly correlated to its processing time. Using this, we obtain an
improved quasi-polynomial time approximation algorithm for correlated
stochastic orienteering.

extend the UPDM/SysML specification language to express the SoS requirements
that the implemented strategies over the SoS must satisfy. The requirements are
specified with a new contract language specifically designed for SoS, targeting
a high-level English- pattern language, but relying on an accurate semantics
given by the standard temporal logics. The contracts are verified against the
UPDM/SysML specification using the Statistical Model Checker (SMC) PLASMA
combined with the simulation engine DESYRE, which integrates heterogeneous
behavioral models through the functional mock-up interface (FMI) standard. The
tool-chain allows computing an estimation of the satisfiability of the
contracts by the SoS. The results help the system architect to trade-off
different solutions to guide the evolution of the SoS.

role and they are based on various formulations of the mechanical statistics.
In these cases, the main assumption is that the swarm elements have a simple
behaviour and that some average properties can be deduced for the entire swarm.
In contrast, complex systems in areas like aeronautics are formed by elements
with sophisticated behaviour, which are even autonomous. In situations like
this, a new approach to swarm coordination is necessary. We present a
stochastic model where the swarm elements are communicating autonomous systems,
the coordination is separated from the component autonomous activity and the
entire swarm can be abstracted away as a piecewise deterministic Markov
process, which constitutes one of the most popular model in stochastic control.

Submitted to MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stt2041",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Indications of a GeV component in the emission from GRBs are known since the
EGRET observations during the 1990's and they have been confirmed by the data
of the Fermi satellite. These results have, however, shown that our
understanding of GRB physics is still unsatisfactory. The new generation of
Cherenkov observatories and in particular the MAGIC telescope, allow for the
first time the possibility to extend the measurement of GRBs from several tens
up to hundreds of GeV energy range. Both leptonic and hadronic processes have
been suggested to explain the possible GeV/TeV counterpart of GRBs.
Observations with ground-based telescopes of very high energy photons (E>30
GeV) from these sources are going to play a key role in discriminating among
the different proposed emission mechanisms, which are barely distinguishable at
lower energies. MAGIC telescope observations of the GRB 090102 (z=1.547) field
and Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data in the same time interval are
analysed to derive upper limits of the GeV/TeV emission. We compare these
results to the expected emissions evaluated for different processes in the
framework of a relativistic blast wave model for the afterglow. Simultaneous
upper limits with Fermi and a Cherenkov telescope have been derived for this
GRB observation. The results we obtained are compatible with the expected
emission although the difficulties in predicting the HE and VHE emission for
the afterglow of this event makes it difficult to draw firmer conclusions.
Nonetheless, MAGIC sensitivity in the energy range of overlap with space-based
instruments (above about 40 GeV) is about one order of magnitude better with
respect to Fermi. This makes evident the constraining power of ground-based
observations and shows that the MAGIC telescope has reached the required
performance to make possible GRB multiwavelength studies in the very high
energy range.

a function of mass using the Sigma_LDR method.
  The amount of dynamical mass segregation measured by Lambda_MSR is generally
only significant for subvirial and virialised, substructured regions - which
usually evolve to form bound clusters. The Sigma_LDR method shows that massive
stars attain higher local densities than the median value in all regions, even
those that are supervirial and evolve to form (unbound) associations.
  We also introduce the Q-Sigma_LDR plot, which describes the evolution of
spatial structure as a function of mass-weighted local density in a star
forming region. Initially dense (>1000 stars pc^{-2}), bound regions always
have Q >1, Sigma_LDR > 2 after 5Myr, whereas dense unbound regions always have
Q < 1, Sigma_LDR > 2 after 5Myr. Less dense regions (<100 stars pc^{-2}) do not
usually exhibit Sigma_LDR > 2 values, and if relatively high local density
around massive stars arises purely from dynamics, then the Q-Sigma_LDR plot can
be used to estimate the initial density of a star forming region.

This ionization-recombination should manifest itself as time-variable
absorption features that can be detected via multi-epoch
high-spectral-resolution observations. Previous studies have shown that the
strongest effect is seen in the neutral sodium D lines. We report on
observations of neutral sodium absorption features observed in multi-epoch
high-resolution spectra of 14 Type Ia supernova events. This is the first
multi-epoch high-resolution study to include multiple SNe. No variability in
line strength that can be associated with circumstellar material is detected.

a hitherto unreported distinct flow focusing effect emerges which is
accompanied by a non-monotonic behaviour of the apparent suspension viscosity

models, and uniqueness results give them a significant advantage over matrix
decomposition methods. However, tensors pose significant algorithmic challenges
and tensors analogs of much of the matrix algebra toolkit are unlikely to exist
because of hardness results. Efficient decomposition in the overcomplete case
(where rank exceeds dimension) is particularly challenging. We introduce a
smoothed analysis model for studying these questions and develop an efficient
algorithm for tensor decomposition in the highly overcomplete case (rank
polynomial in the dimension). In this setting, we show that our algorithm is
robust to inverse polynomial error -- a crucial property for applications in
learning since we are only allowed a polynomial number of samples. While
algorithms are known for exact tensor decomposition in some overcomplete
settings, our main contribution is in analyzing their stability in the
framework of smoothed analysis.
  Our main technical contribution is to show that tensor products of perturbed
vectors are linearly independent in a robust sense (i.e. the associated matrix
has singular values that are at least an inverse polynomial). This key result
paves the way for applying tensor methods to learning problems in the smoothed
setting. In particular, we use it to obtain results for learning multi-view
models and mixtures of axis-aligned Gaussians where there are many more
""components"" than dimensions. The assumption here is that the model is not
adversarially chosen, formalized by a perturbation of model parameters. We
believe this an appealing way to analyze realistic instances of learning
problems, since this framework allows us to overcome many of the usual
limitations of using tensor methods.

fermion triplet can greatly affect the branching ratios of the stops, even in
the absence of a direct stop-triplet coupling. We compare the triplet extension
with the MSSM and discuss how the additional fields affect the search for stop

as the Eagle nebula (M16) and the Rosette molecular cloud, and understanding
their origin will help characterize triggered star formation. The formation
mechanisms of these structures are still being debated. Recent numerical
simulations have shown how pillars can arise from the collapse of the shell in
on itself and how globules can be formed from the interplay of the turbulent
molecular cloud and the ionization from massive stars. The goal here is to test
this scenario through recent observations of two massive star-forming regions,
M16 and Rosette. The column density structure of the interface between
molecular clouds and H ii regions was characterized using column density maps
obtained from far-infrared imaging of the Herschel HOBYS key programme. Then,
the DisPerSe algorithm was used on these maps to detect the compressed layers
around the ionized gas and pillars in different evolutionary states. Finally,
their velocity structure was investigated using CO data, and all observational
signatures were tested against some distinct diagnostics established from
simulations. The column density profiles have revealed the importance of
compression at the edge of the ionized gas. The velocity properties of the
structures, i.e. pillars and globules, are very close to what we predict from
the numerical simulations. We have identified a good candidate of a nascent
pillar in the Rosette molecular cloud that presents the velocity pattern of the
shell collapsing on itself, induced by a high local curvature. Globules have a
bulk velocity dispersion that indicates the importance of the initial
turbulence in their formation, as proposed from numerical simulations.
Altogether, this study re-enforces the picture of pillar formation by shell
collapse and globule formation by the ionization of highly turbulent clouds.

exploit a transition in the skewness of the signal in the continuum-subtracted
image, which appears when the image changes from being under-subtracted to
over-subtracted. Tests on one-dimensional artificial images demonstrate that
the transition identifies the optimal scaling factor {\mu} to be used on the
broad-band image IB in order to produce the optimal line-emission image IE,
i.e., IE =IN - {\mu} IB, with IN the original (un-subtracted) narrow-band
image. The advantage of this method is that it uses all information-bearing
pixels in the final image, and not just a sub-set of those pixels (the latter
being common in many traditional approaches to stellar continuum removal from
narrow-band images). We apply our method to actual images, both from
ground-based and space facilities, in particular to WFPC2 and ACS images from
the Hubble Space Telescope, and we show that it is successful irrespective of
the nature of the sources (point-like or extended). We also discuss the impact
on the accuracy of the method of non-optimal images, such as those containing
saturated sources or non-uniform background, and present `workarounds' for
those problems.

detections from real data with the Monte Carlo results, we assign the
completeness and reliability values to each real detection. From 1574 spectra,
we obtain 881 raw detections and, by removing low reliability detections, we
finalize 649 detections from an automated pipeline. Most of high completeness
and reliability detections, (C, R) ~ (1.0, 1.0), are robust detections when
visually inspected; the low C and R detections are also marginal on visual

mass (Mstar)-SFR grid. We study the scaling relations between Mdust, Mstar and
SFR at z<=2.5. No clear evolution of Mdust is observed at fixed SFR and Mstar.
We find a tight correlation between SFR and Mdust, likely a consequence of the
Schmidt-Kennicutt (S-K) law. The Mstar-Mdust correlation observed by previous
works flattens or sometimes disappears when fixing the SFR. Most of it likely
derives from the combination of the Mdust-SFR and Mstar-SFR correlations. We
then investigate the gas content as inferred by converting Mdust by assuming
that the dust/gas ratio scales linearly with the gas metallicity. All galaxies
in the sample follow, within uncertainties, the same SFR-Mgas relation
(integrated S-K law), which broadly agrees with CO-based results for the bulk
of the population, despite the completely different approaches. The majority of
galaxies at z~2 form stars with an efficiency (SFE=SFR/Mgas) ~5 times higher
than at z~0. It is not clear what fraction of such variation is an intrinsic
redshift evolution and what fraction arises from selection effects. The gas
fraction (fgas) decreases with Mstar and increases with SFR, and does not
evolve with z at fixed Mstar and SFR. We explain these trends by introducing a
universal relation between fgas, Mstar and SFR, non-evolving out to z~2.5.
Galaxies move across this relation as their gas content evolves in time. We use
the 3D fundamental fgas-Mstar-SFR relation and the redshift evolution of the
Main Sequence to estimate the evolution of fgas in the average population of
galaxies as a function of z and Mstar, and we find evidence a downsizing
scenario.

breaking phase. At low energies the system flows to an nontrivial conformal
fixed point. Novel vortex physics arises from the interaction of these gapless
degrees of freedom with the vortex: at low energies the vortex may be
understood as a conformal defect in this low energy theory. Defect conformal
symmetry allows the construction of a simple infrared geometry describing a new
kind of extremal horizon: a Poincare horizon with a small bubble of magnetic
Reissner-Nordstrom horizon inside it that carries a single unit of magnetic
flux and a finite amount of entropy even at zero temperature. We also construct
the full geometry describing the vortex at finite temperature in a UV complete
theory. We study both superfluid and superconducting boundary conditions and
calculate thermodynamic properties of the vortex. A study of vortex stability
reveals that the dual superconductor can be Type I or Type II, depending on the
charge of the condensed scalar. Finally, we study forces on a moving vortex at
finite temperature from the point of view of defect conformal symmetry and show
that these forces can be expressed in terms of Kubo formulas of defect CFT
operators.

organizations. Using an evolutionary theoretic approach to collective decision
making, agent-based simulations were conducted to investigate how human
collective decision making would be affected by the agents' diversity in
problem understanding and/or behavior in discussion, as well as by their social
network structure. Simulation results indicated that groups with consistent
problem understanding tended to produce higher utility values of ideas and
displayed better decision convergence, but only if there was no group-level
bias in collective problem understanding. Simulation results also indicated the
importance of balance between selection-oriented (i.e., exploitative) and
variation-oriented (i.e., explorative) behaviors in discussion to achieve
quality final decisions. Expanding the group size and introducing non-trivial
social network structure generally improved the quality of ideas at the cost of
decision convergence. Simulations with different social network topologies
revealed collective decision making on small-world networks with high local
clustering tended to achieve highest decision quality more often than on random
or scale-free networks. Implications of this evolutionary theory and simulation
approach for future managerial research on collective, group, and multi-level
decision making are discussed.

loss applied to the two cores, and cubic-quintic (CQ) nonlinearity acting in
each one. The 2D and 1D models may be realized in dual-core optical waveguides,
in the spatiotemporal and spatial domains, respectively. Stationary solutions
for $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric solitons in these systems reduce to their
counterparts in the usual coupler. The most essential problem is the stability
of the solitons, which become unstable against symmetry breaking with the
increase of the energy (norm), and retrieve the stability at still larger
energies. The boundary value of the intercore-coupling constant, above which
the solitons are completely stable, is found by means of an analytical
approximation, based on the CW (zero-dimensional) counterpart of the system.
The approximation demonstrates good agreement with numerical findings for the
1D and 2D solitons. Numerical results for the stability limits of the 2D
solitons are obtained by means of the computation of eigenvalues for small
perturbations, and verified in direct simulations. Although large parts of the
solitons families are unstable, the instability is quite weak. Collisions
between 2D solitons in the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric coupler are studied by
means of simulations. Outcomes of the collisions are inelastic but not
destructive, as they do not break the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry.

explore the dependence of the signal on total angular momentum and its

general-relativistic core collapse simulations in which we vary the initial
angular momentum distribution in the core. Our simulations include a
microphysical finite-temperature EOS, an approximate electron capture treatment
during collapse, and a neutrino leakage scheme for the postbounce evolution. We
find that the precise distribution of angular momentum is relevant only for
very rapidly rotating cores with T/|W|>~8% at bounce. We construct a numerical
template bank from our baseline set of simulations, and carry out additional
simulations to generate trial waveforms for injection into simulated advanced
LIGO noise at a fiducial galactic distance of 10 kpc. Using matched filtering,
we show that for an optimally-oriented source and Gaussian noise, advanced
Advanced LIGO could measure the total angular momentum to within ~20%, for
rapidly rotating cores. For most waveforms, the nearest known degree of
precollapse differential rotation is correctly inferred by both our matched
filtering analysis and an alternative Bayesian model selection approach. We
test our results for robustness against systematic uncertainties by injecting
waveforms from simulations using a different EOS and and variations in the
electron fraction in the inner core. The results of these tests show that these
uncertainties significantly reduce the accuracy with which the total angular
momentum and its precollapse distribution can be inferred from observations.

searches for supernovae or transiting exoplanets, which set the cadence with
which fields are re-imaged. In the case of the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF),
several sub-surveys are conducted in parallel, leading to non-uniform sampling
over its $\sim$$20,000 \mathrm{deg}^2$ footprint. While the median $7.26
\mathrm{deg}^2$ PTF field has been imaged $\sim$40 times in \textit{R}-band,
$\sim$$2300 \mathrm{deg}^2$ have been observed $>$100 times. We use PTF data to
study the trade-off between searching for microlensing events in a survey whose
footprint is much larger than that of typical microlensing searches, but with
far-from-optimal time sampling. To examine the probability that microlensing
events can be recovered in these data, we test statistics used on uniformly
sampled data to identify variables and transients. We find that the von Neumann
ratio performs best for identifying simulated microlensing events in our data.
We develop a selection method using this statistic and apply it to data from
fields with $>$10 $R$-band observations, $1.1\times10^9$ light curves,
uncovering three candidate microlensing events. We lack simultaneous,
multi-color photometry to confirm these as microlensing events. However, their
number is consistent with predictions for the event rate in the PTF footprint
over the survey's three years of operations, as estimated from near-field
microlensing models. This work can help constrain all-sky event rate
predictions and tests microlensing signal recovery in large data sets, which
will be useful to future time-domain surveys, such as that planned with the
Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.

described as white noise. The overall lack of evidence for red noise implies
that sensitivity to a (red) gravitational wave background signal is limited by
statistical rather than systematic uncertainty. In all pulsars, the ratio of
non-white noise to white noise is low, so that we can increase the cadence or
integration times of our observations and still expect the root-mean-square of
timing residual averages to decrease by the square-root of observation time,
which is key to improving the sensitivity of the pulsar timing array.

redshift determination in the SDSS catalogue. We match this sample with the
WISE catalogue, and fit the SEDs of the 2844 sources which have three, or more,
photometric data-points in the infrared. We then select the heavily obscured
AGN candidates by comparing their 12 micron AGN luminosity to the observed 2-10
keV X-ray luminosity and their expected intrinsic relation. With this approach
we find 20 candidates, and we examine their X-ray and optical spectra. Of the
20 initial candidates, we find nine (64%; out of the 14, for which X-ray
spectra could be fit) based on the X-ray spectra, and seven (78%; out of the
nine detected spectroscopically in the SDSS) based on the [OIII] line fluxes.
Combining all criteria, we determine the final number of heavily obscured AGN
to be 12-19, and the number of Compton-thick AGN to be 2-5, showing that the
method is reliable in finding obscured AGN, but not Compton-thick. However
those numbers are smaller than what would be expected from X-ray background
population synthesis models, which demonstrates how the optical-infrared
selection and the scatter of the L_x-L_MIR relation introduced by observational
constraints limit the efficiency of the method. Finally, we test popular
obscured AGN selection methods based on mid-infrared colours, and find that the
probability of an AGN to be selected by its mid-infrared colours increases with
the X-ray luminosity. However, a selection scheme based on a relatively low
X-ray luminosity and mid-infrared colours characteristic of QSOs would not
select ~25% of the heavily obscured AGN of our sample. (abridged)

near-fields (i.e., evanescent waves) emitted by a two-dimensional periodic
array of electric dipoles to propagating waves. In particular, large order
Floquet harmonics with transverse magnetic (TM) polarization, that would be
evanescent in free space and therefore confined near the array surface, are
transformed into propagating spectrum inside the HM, and thus carry power away.
Because of this property, independent of the finite or infinite extent of the
HM, the power generated by an array of elementary electric dipoles is strongly
enhanced when the array is located near a HM surface and is mostly directed
into the HM. In particular, the power coupled to the HM exhibits narrow
frequency features that can be employed in detection applications. The results
shown in this paper provide a clear signature on wave dynamics in HMs. A link
between the results pertaining to the case of an isolated dipole on top of HM
and the planar array is found convenient to explain both wave dynamics and
spectral power distribution. The narrow frequency emission features appear in
the array case only; they depend on its spatial periodicity and remarkable on
the HM thickness.

preexisting field in the corona, and a current sheet generally forms at the
boundary between the old and new magnetic domains. Reconnection in the current
sheet relaxes this highly stressed configuration to a lower energy state. This
scenario is most familiar, and most often studied, in flares, where the flux
transfer is rapid. We present here a study of steady, quiescent flux transfer
occurring at a rate three orders of magnitude below that in a large flare. In
particular we quantify the reconnection rate, and related energy release,
occurring as new polarity emerges to form Active Region 11112
(2010-10-16T00:S18W14) within a region of preexisting flux. A bright, low lying
kernel of coronal loops above the emerging polarity, observed with AIA onboard
SDO and XRT onboard Hinode, originally shows magnetic connectivity only between
regions of newly emerged flux when overlaid on magnetograms from HMI. Over the
course of several days, this bright kernel advances into the preexisting flux.
The advancement of an easily visible boundary into the old flux regions allows
measurement of the rate of reconnection between old and new magnetic domains.
We compare the reconnection rate to the inferred heating of the coronal plasma.
To our knowledge, this is the first measurement of steady, quiescent heating
related to reconnection. We determine that the newly emerged flux reconnects at
a fairly steady rate of 0.38e16 Mx/s over two days, while the radiated power
varies between 2~8e25 erg/s over the same time. We find that as much as 40% of
the total emerged flux at any given time may have reconnected. The total amount
of transferred flux (1e21 Mx) and radiated energy (7.2e30 ergs) are comparable
to that of a large M- or small X-class flare, but are stretched out over 45
hours.

order to enhance fault tolerance, optimize bandwidth use, and improve security.
Selecting data flow paths based on cost addresses performance issues but
ignores security threats. Attackers can disrupt the data flows by attacking the
links along the paths. Denial-of-service, remote exploitation, and other such
attacks launched on any single link can severely limit throughput. Networks can
be secured using a secure quality of service approach in which a sender
disperses data along multiple secure paths. In this secure multi-path approach,
a portion of the data from the sender is transmitted over each path and the
receiver assembles the data fragments that arrive. One of the largest
challenges in secure multipath routing is determining the security threat level
along each path and providing a commensurate level of encryption along that
path. The research presented explores the effects of real-world attack
scenarios in systems, and gauges the threat levels along each path. Optimal
sampling and compression of network data is provided via compressed sensing.
The probability of the presence of specific attack signatures along a network
path is determined using machine learning techniques. Using these
probabilities, information assurance levels are derived such that security
measures along vulnerable paths are increased.

analyzing the genomes of environmental samples comprising many different
diverse organisms. Given the nature of metagenomic data, one usually has to
sequence the genomic material of all organisms in a batch, leading to a mix of
reads coming from different DNA sequences. In deep high-throughput sequencing
experiments, the volume of the raw reads is extremely high, frequently
exceeding 600 Gb. With an ever increasing demand for storing such reads for
future studies, the issue of efficient metagenomic compression becomes of
paramount importance. We present the first known approach to metagenome read
compression, termed MCUIUC (Metagenomic Compression at UIUC). The gist of the
proposed algorithm is to perform classification of reads based on unique
organism identifiers, followed by reference-based alignment of reads for
individually identified organisms, and metagenomic assembly of unclassified
reads. Once assembly and classification are completed, lossless reference based
compression is performed via positional encoding. We evaluate the performance
of the algorithm on moderate sized synthetic metagenomic samples involving 15
randomly selected organisms and describe future directions for improving the
proposed compression method.

balance causing an ideal Fabry-Perot resonance condition in spite of material
absorption and non-ideal reflectivities. This counterintuitive resonance occurs
if and only if the metallic Fabry-Perot plates are in relative motion to each

approach the resonance arises from the conversion of the mechanical energy of
motion to electromagnetic energy. The phenomenon is similar to lasing where the
losses in the cavity resonance are exactly compensated by optical gain media
instead of mechanical motion. Nonlinearities and non-localities in material
response will inevitably curtail any singularities however we show the giant
enhancement in non-equilibrium phenomena due to such resonances in moving

  matching",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A monotone CNF formula is a Boolean formula in conjunctive normal form where
each variable appears positively. We design a deterministic fully
polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for counting the number of
satisfying assignments for a given monotone CNF formula when each variable
appears in at most $5$ clauses. Equivalently, this is also an FPTAS for
counting set covers where each set contains at most $5$ elements. If we allow
variables to appear in a maximum of $6$ clauses (or sets to contain $6$
elements), it is NP-hard to approximate it. Thus, this gives a complete
understanding of the approximability of counting for monotone CNF formulas. It
is also an important step towards a complete characterization of the
approximability for all bounded degree Boolean #CSP problems. In addition, we
study the hypergraph matching problem, which arises naturally towards a
complete classification of bounded degree Boolean #CSP problems, and show an
FPTAS for counting 3D matchings of hypergraphs with maximum degree $4$.
  Our main technique is correlation decay, a powerful tool to design
deterministic FPTAS for counting problems defined by local constraints among a
number of variables. All previous uses of this design technique fall into two
categories: each constraint involves at most two variables, such as independent
set, coloring, and spin systems in general; or each variable appears in at most
two constraints, such as matching, edge cover, and holant problem in general.
The CNF problems studied here have more complicated structures than these
problems and require new design and proof techniques. As it turns out, the
technique we developed for the CNF problem also works for the hypergraph
matching problem. We believe that it may also find applications in other CSP or
more general counting problems.

transform all these structures into each other and proposed to employ this
property to extend any successful algorithm that inverts matrices of one of
these classes to inverting matrices of the three other classes. The power of
this approach was widely recognized later, when novel numerically stable
algorithms solved nonsingular Toeplitz linear systems of equations at first in
quadratic and then in nearly linear (versus classical cubic) arithmetic time by
means of transforming Toeplitz into Cauchy matrix structures and then linking
it to the Hierarchical Semiseparable matrix structure, a specialization of
matrix representations employed by the Fast Multipole Method. We first cover
the method of structure transformation comprehensively, then analyze the latter
algorithms for Toeplitz linear systems and extend them to approximate the
products of Vandermonde and Cauchy matrices by a vector and the solutions of
Vandermonde and Cauchy linear systems of equations where they are nonsingular

fracture propagation in quasi-brittle materials using the Material Point
Method. The kinematics of constitutive models is enriched with an additional
mode of localized deformation to take into account the strain discontinuity
once cracking has occurred. The crack details therefore can be stored at
material point level and there is no need to enrich the kinematics of finite
elements to capture the localization caused by fracturing processes. This
enhancement also removes the drawback of classical smeared crack approach in
producing unphysical snapping back constitutive responses when the spatial
resolution is not fine enough. All these facilitate the implementation of the
new approach in the Material Point Method for analysis of large scale problems.
Numerical examples of fracture propagation are used to demonstrate the
effectiveness and potentials of the new approach.

  damage systems in non-smooth domains",,,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper focuses on rate-independent damage in elastic bodies. Since the
driving energy is nonconvex, solutions may have jumps as a function of time,
and in this situation it is known that the classical concept of energetic
solutions for rate-independent systems may fail to accurately describe the
behavior of the system at jumps. Therefore we resort to the (by now
well-established) vanishing viscosity approach to rate-independent modeling,
and approximate the model by its viscous regularization. In fact, the analysis
of the latter PDE system presents remarkable difficulties, due to its highly
nonlinear character. We tackle it by combining a variational approach to a
class of abstract doubly nonlinear evolution equations, with careful regularity
estimates tailored to this specific system, relying on a q-Laplacian type
gradient regularization of the damage variable. Hence for the viscous problem
we conclude the existence of weak solutions, satisfying a suitable
energy-dissipation inequality that is the starting point for the vanishing
viscosity analysis. The latter leads to the notion of (weak) parameterized
solution to our rate-independent system, which encompasses the influence of
viscosity in the description of the jump regime.

on the rheological properties of highly-dense particle-laden flows. In
particular, we are interested in the close-packing limit (jamming) and the
question if ""universal"" observables can be identified that do not depend on the
details of the dissipation model. To this end, we define a simplified
lubrication force and systematically vary the range $h_c$ of this interaction.
For fixed $h_c$ a cross-over is seen from a Newtonian flow regime at small
strain rates to inertia-dominated flow at larger strain rates. The same
cross-over is observed as a function of the lubrication range $h_c$. At the
same time, but only at high densities close to jamming, particle velocity as
well as local density distributions are unaffected by changes in the
lubrication range -- they are candidates for ""universal"" behavior. At densities
away from jamming, this universality is lost: short-range lubrication forces
lead to pronounced particle clustering, while longer-ranged lubrication does
not. These findings highlight the importance of ""geometric"" packing constraints
for particle motion -- independent of the specific dissipation model. With the
free volume vanishing at random-close packing, particle motion is more and more
constrained by the ever smaller amount of free space. On the other side,
macroscopic rheological observables, as well as higher-order correlation
functions retain the variability of the underlying dissipation model.

general Tutte polynomial of a morphism of matroids has a complete set of
deletion-contraction relations, its specialisation to cellularly embedded
graphs does not. Here we extend the Las Vergnas polynomial to graphs in
pseudo-surfaces. We show that in this setting we can define deletion and
contraction for embedded graphs consistently with the deletion and contraction
of the underlying matroid perspective, thus yielding a version of the Las
Vergnas polynomial with complete recursive definition. This also enables us to
obtain a deeper understanding of the relationships among the Las Vergnas
polynomial, the Bollobas-Riordan polynomial, and the Krushkal polynomial. We
also take this opportunity to extend some of Las Vergnas' results on Eulerian
circuits from graphs in surfaces of low genus to surfaces of arbitrary genus.

to the prevailing opinion, the NLM weights do not allow to get a reliable
measure of the similarity in a noisy image, unless one add a locality
constraint. As an image denoising method, the Non-Local Means prove to be
local. Some works had already pointed out that to get the best denoising
performances with the NLM algorithm, one should run it locally. But no general
conclusion has been yet proposed and the only explanation that was proposed to
justify the experimental results is not sufficient. Our study based on
experimental evidence proves that, on average on natural images, the bias of
the NLM estimator is an increasing function of the radius of the similarity
searching zone. The reason for this phenomenon is that noise disrupts the order
of similarity between patches. Hence the mean squared error between the
original image and the NLM estimation, which is the sum of the bias, the
variance and the covariance of the estimator, has an absolute minimum for a
disk of radius 3 to 4 pixels.

this study, the placement problem is addressed from the perspective of the
electrical structure which, unlike existing work on PMU placement, accounts for
the sensitivity between power injections and nodal phase angle differences
between various buses in the power network. A linear dynamic model captures the
time evolution of system states, and a simple procedure is devised to estimate
the state transition function at each time instant. The placement problem is
formulated as a series (time steps) of binary integer programs, with the goal
to obtain the minimum number of PMUs at each time step for complete network
observability in the absence of zero injection measurements. Experiments are
conducted on several standard IEEE test bus systems. The main thesis of this
study is that, owing to the dynamic nature of the system states, for optimal

the given network, though it is undesirable from an economic standpoint.

numerically solved to describe system dynamics in the presence of decay. In
particular, we discuss correlated spontaneous emission from a pair of
electronically excited diatomic ro-vibrational states due to their laser
induced coupling to the ground continuum of atomic scattering states. This
allows us to calculate time-dependence of emitted radiation intensity. It
exhibits quantum beats due to coherent dynamics. The phase difference between
the two driving fields is found to significantly affect the decay dynamics and
the beats. Our results demonstrate the possibility to control decay from the
molecular excited states and the decoherence between them by changing the
relative intensity and the phase between the lasers. We further show that, if
the ground-state continuum has a shape resonance at a low energy, then the
quantum beats show two distinctive time scales of oscillations in the strong
coupling regime. One of the time scales originates from the energy gap between
the two excited states while the other time scale corresponds to the collision

alignment of angular momenta of independent single-particle motions, we find
that the obtained moment of inertia for rotations about an axis perpendicular
to the symmetry axis is close to the rigid-body value. We also analyze the
microscopic structure of the precession motion using the random-phase

precession motion of the torus isomer is generated by coherent superposition of
many one-particle-one-hole excitations across the sloping Fermi surface that
strongly violates the time-reversal symmetry. By comparing results of the TDHF

  Previous work of one of the authors showed that when the geometric component
is weak, the limiting degree sequence of the resulting graph coincides with
that of the standard Barab\'asi--Albert preferential attachment model. We show
that at the other extreme, in the case of a sufficiently strong geometric

show the presence of an intermediate regime, in which the behaviour differs
significantly from both the on-line nearest-neighbour graph and the
Barab\'asi--Albert model; in this regime, we obtain a stretched exponential

quasi-two dimensional traps. The interactions are modeled by two-parameter
potentials with parameters being the range $r_0$ and the $s$-wave scattering
length $a_s$. We show that one can make use of two forms of finite-range model
potentials, one for $a_s > 0$ and the other for $a_s < 0$. Both potentials
reduce to same form in the limits $a_s \rightarrow \pm \infty $. We investigate
into the dependence of the binding energies and the wave functions of two-atom
trap-bound states on $a_s$ and $r_0$. In particular, we study the effects of
$a_s$ ranging from large negative to large positive values on the bound state
properties. Our results show that long-range interactions with infinite
scattering length significantly alter the ground-state energy of the two atoms
in a quasi-two or two dimensional trap. In contrast, short-range interactions
can not significantly change the ground-state energy of two atoms in a 2D

mergers of supermassive black hole binaries, which depopulate galaxy centers by
gravitationally slingshotting central stars toward large radii. Such binaries
naturally form in mergers of luminous galaxies. Here, we analyze the population
of central stellar orbits in 11 massive elliptical galaxies that we observed

includes the effects of a central black hole, the mass distribution of the

kinematics and the inclusion of dark matter is important to conclude upon the
distribution of stellar orbits in galaxy centers. Six of our galaxies are core
galaxies. In these six galaxies, but not in the galaxies without cores, we
detect a coherent lack of stars on radial orbits in the core region and a
uniform excess of radial orbits outside of it: when scaled by the core radius,
the radial profiles of the classical anisotropy parameter beta are nearly
identical in core galaxies. Moreover, they match quantitatively the predictions
of black hole binary simulations, providing the first convincing dynamical
evidence for core scouring in the most massive elliptical galaxies.

been suggested that the presence of large numbers of millisecond pulsars (MSPs)

fluxes through emission of pulsed curvature radiation, or indirectly through
the injection of relativistic leptons into the cluster. These relativistic
particles are plausibly re-accelerated in shocks, created by the collision of
stellar winds, before interacting with the soft-photon radiation field set up
by the stellar population of the host cluster. Inverse Compton (IC) scattering
then produces gamma-radiation in the TeV band. In order to calculate the IC
spectrum, an accurate profile for the energy density of the soft-photon field

expression for the stellar energy density, and then solve it numerically. As a
next step, the average energy density values for three different regions of the
cluster (demarcated by its core, half-mass, and tidal radii) are determined,
which we consequently import into an existing radiation code to predict the TeV
gamma-ray spectrum. As an application, we consider the case of Terzan 5,

quality assurance processes today. Typically, these processes are applied in
isolation, which, however, fails to exploit the benefits of systematically
combining and integrating them. In consequence, tests are not focused based on
early defect detection data. Expected benefits of such process integration
include higher defect detection rates or reduced quality assurance effort.
Moreover, when conducting testing without any prior information regarding the
system's quality, it is often unclear how to focus testing. A systematic
integration of inspection and testing processes requires context-specific
knowledge about the relationships between inspections and testing. This
knowledge is typically not available and needs to be empirically identified and
validated. Often, context-specific assumptions can be seen as a starting point
for generating such knowledge. Based on the In2Test approach, which uses
inspection data to focus testing, we present in this article how knowledge
about the relationship between inspections and testing can be gained,
documented, and evolved in an analytical or empirical manner. In addition, this
article gives an overview of related work and highlights future research

ontologies. Two ontologies may be similar in some aspects such as structure,
semantic etc. Most ontology matching systems integrate multiple matchers to
extract all the similarities that two ontologies may have. Thus, we face a
major problem to aggregate different similarities. Some matching systems use
experimental weights for aggregation of similarities among different matchers
while others use machine learning approaches and optimization algorithms to
find optimal weights to assign to different matchers. However, both approaches
have their own deficiencies. In this paper, we will point out the problems and
shortcomings of current similarity aggregation strategies. Then, we propose a
new strategy, which enables us to utilize the structural information of
ontologies to get weights of matchers, for the similarity aggregation task. For
achieving this goal, we create a new Ontology Matching system which it uses
three available matchers, namely GMO, ISub and VDoc. We have tested our
similarity aggregation strategy on the OAEI 2012 data set. Experimental results
show significant improvements in accuracies of several cases, especially in
matching the classes of ontologies. We will compare the performance of our

for exploiting the non-linearity of a large radiation pressure coupling, the
main non-linearity in this setup originates from a cross-Kerr type of coupling
between the resonators, where the cavity refractive index depends on the phonon

abstract elementary class with perturbations that is $d^p$-superstable

of homogeneous model theory if and only if the measure of dependence is
$<\varepsilon$ for all $\varepsilon >0$. As an example of our measure of
dependence we show a connection between the measure and entropy in models from
quantum mechanics in which the spectrum of the observable is discrete. As an
application, we show that weak simplicity implies a very strong form of
simplicity and study the question of when the dependence inside a set of all

the type is not regular. In the end of the paper, we demonstrate our notions

The study of BL Lac objects (BLL) detected in gamma-rays gives
insights on the acceleration mechanisms in play in such systems and is also a
valuable tool to constrain the density of the extragalactic background light.
As their spectra are dominated by the non-thermal emission of the jet and the
spectral features are weak and narrow in the optical domain, measuring their
redshift is challenging. However such a measure is fundamental as it allows a
firm determination of the distance and luminosity of the source, and therefore
a consistent model of its emission. Aims. Measurement of the redshift of BLL
detected in gamma-rays and determination of global properties of their host
galaxies. Methods. We observed a sample of eight BLL (KUV 00311-1938, PKS

J0816-1311 and RBS 334) with the X-shooter spectrograph installed at the ESO
Very Large Telescope in order to take advantage of its unprecedented wavelength
coverage and of its resolution about 5 times higher than generally used in such
studies. We extracted UVB to NIR spectra that we then corrected for telluric
absorption and calibrated in flux. We systematically searched for spectral
features. When possible, we determined the contribution of the host galaxy to
the overall emission. Results. Of the eight BLL, we measured the redshift of
five of them and determined lower limits for two through the detection of
intervening systems. All seven of these objects have redshifts greater than
0.2. In two cases, we refuted redshift values reported in other publications.
Through careful modelling, we determined the magnitude of the host galaxies. In
two cases, the detection of emission lines allowed to provide hints on the
overall properties of the gas in the host galaxies.

the half-life of cluster decay. The shell correction contribution into the

modern batteries and supercapacitors. Intercalation involves complex diffusion
processes along and across the layers, but the microscopic mechanisms and

interaction, with the dynamics governed by defects anchored to graphene
wrinkles. Our findings are relevant for the future design and application of

of spherical colloidal particles immersed in a binary liquid mixture near its
critical demixing point and exposed to chemically patterned substrates.
Inspired by these experiments, we study this kind of effective interaction,
known as the critical Casimir effect, for elongated colloids of cylindrical
shape. This adds orientational degrees of freedom. When the colloidal particles
are close to a chemically structured substrate, a critical Casimir torque
acting on the colloids emerges. We calculate this torque on the basis of the
Derjaguin approximation. The range of validity of the latter is assessed via
mean-field theory. This assessment shows that the Derjaguin approximation is
reliable in experimentally relevant regimes, so that we extend it to Janus
particles endowed with opposing adsorption preferences. Our analysis indicates
that critical Casimir interactions are capable of achieving well-defined,
reversible alignments both of chemically homogeneous and of Janus cylinders.

making an adjustment on the neutron $1f$ spin--orbit splitting for the nuclei
$^{40}$Ca, $^{48}$Ca and $^{56}$Ni. The first nucleus is not used to adjust the

spin--orbit strength. One of the main conclusions of this work is that some
existing Skyrme parametrizations containing the tensor force should not be
employed because the wrong sign of the tensor parameters does not lead to the
correct behavior (by comparing with the experimental results). This study also
allows us to better constrain the tensor parameters in the Gogny case, where
much less work is published and boundaries and signs for the parameters have

Henzinger, and Ho, provides a formal modeling and analysis environment to
analyze the interaction between the discrete and the continuous parts of
cyber-physical systems. Hybrid automata can be considered as generalizations of
finite state automata augmented with a finite set of real-valued variables
whose dynamics in each state is governed by a system of ordinary differential
equations. Moreover, the discrete transitions of hybrid automata are guarded by
constraints over the values of these real-valued variables, and enable
discontinuous jumps in the evolution of these variables. Singular hybrid
automata are a subclass of hybrid automata where dynamics is specified by
state-dependent constant vectors. Henzinger, Kopke, Puri, and Varaiya showed
that for even very restricted subclasses of singular hybrid automata, the
fundamental verification questions, like reachability and schedulability, are
undecidable. In this paper we present \emph{weak singular hybrid automata}

the decidability (and the exact complexity) of various verification questions

undecidability of reachability problem.

$N_t$ is odd. Here, we use an ordinary square lattice with the normal

$\lambda_n^{N_t -1}$ in the Dirac spectral sum, this analytical relation
indicates negligibly small contribution of low-lying Dirac modes to the
Polyakov loop in both confined and deconfined phases, while the low-lying Dirac
modes are essential for chiral symmetry breaking. Also, we numerically confirm
the analytical relation, non-zero finiteness of $\langle n|\hat U_4|n \rangle$,
and tiny contribution of low-lying Dirac modes to the Polyakov loop in lattice
QCD simulations. Thus, we conclude that low-lying Dirac modes are not essential

capture the behaviour of the actual energy function than a low resolution

parameters such as the Hubble constant, the present cluster abundances and the
age of the Universe. The existing tension between Planck determination of these
parameters in the frame of the base LambdaCDM model and their direct
measurements generated lively discussions and several interpretations. In this
paper we quantify this tension by exploring several extensions of the base
LambdaCDM model that include the leptonic asymmetry. We set bounds on the
radiation content of the Universe and neutrino properties by using the latest
cosmological measurements, imposing also self-consistent BBN constraints on the
primordial helium abundance. For all cosmological asymmetric models we find the
preference of cosmological data for smaller values of active and sterile
neutrino masses. This increases the tension between cosmological and short
baseline neutrino oscillation data that favor a sterile neutrino with the mass
of around 1 eV. For the case of degenerate massive neutrinos, we find that the
discrepancies with direct determinations of the Hubble constant, the present
cluster abundances and the age of the Universe are alleviated at ~ 1.3 sigma
for all leptonic asymmetric models. We also find ~2 sigma statistical evidence
of the preference of cosmological data for the normal neutrino hierarchy. This
is more evident for the case of cosmological models involving leptonic
asymmetry and three massive neutrino species. We conclude that the current
cosmological data favor the leptonic asymmetric extension of the base LambdaCDM
model and normal neutrino mass hierarchy over the models with additional
sterile neutrino species and/or inverted neutrino mass hierarchy.

denoise them. A mixed space-frequency approach improves the denoising
performances of NLM because it ensures that the information is redundant

simple : it consists in running two times the NLM algorithm (firstly in the
frequency domain and secondly in the spatial domain). For fine textures and
isolated points we get a better visual reconstruction than with the original

via correlational studies. Due to the nature of the individual experiments,
based on eliciting neural response from a small number of stimuli, this link is
incomplete, and unidirectional from the causal point of view. To come to
conclusions on the function implied by the activation of brain regions, it is
necessary to combine a wide exploration of the various brain functions and some
inversion of the statistical inference. Here we introduce a methodology for
accumulating knowledge towards a bidirectional link between observed brain
activity and the corresponding function. We rely on a large corpus of imaging
studies and a predictive engine. Technically, the challenges are to find
commonality between the studies without denaturing the richness of the corpus.
The key elements that we contribute are labeling the tasks performed with a
cognitive ontology, and modeling the long tail of rare paradigms in the corpus.
To our knowledge, our approach is the first demonstration of predicting the
cognitive content of completely new brain images. To that end, we propose a
method that predicts the experimental paradigms across different studies.

characterized by the axial symmetry of the Fermi surface and by a single

The distortion is identified without any assumption on the lens model because
of the use of a grid technique approach. Last, shape measurement and shape
variation is caught by fringe projection. Analysis is based on two pin-hole
assumptions for the video-projector and the camera. Then, fringe projection is
coupled to in-plane displacement to give rise to 3D measurement set-up.
Metrological characterization shows a resolution comparable to classical
(stereo) correlation technique (1/100th pixel). Spatial resolution seems to be
an advantage of the method, because of the use of temporal phase stepping
(shape measurement, 1 pixel) and windowed Fourier transform (in plane
displacements measurement, 9 pixels). Two examples are given. First one is the
study of skin properties; second one is a study on leather fabric. In both
cases, results are convincing, and have been exploited to give mechanical
interpretation.

instantiation, it only offers querying according to the RDF semantics and would
thus ignore the semantics of data expressed with respect to (RDF) schemas or
(OWL) ontologies. Several extensions to SPARQL have been proposed to query RDF
data modulo RDFS, i.e., interpreting the query with RDFS semantics and/or
considering external ontologies. We introduce a general framework which allows
for expressing query answering modulo a particular semantics in an homogeneous
way. In this paper, we discuss extensions of SPARQL that use regular
expressions to navigate RDF graphs and may be used to answer queries
considering RDFS semantics. We also consider their embedding as extensions of
SPARQL. These SPARQL extensions are interpreted within the proposed framework
and their drawbacks are presented. In particular, we show that the PSPARQL
query language, a strict extension of SPARQL offering transitive closure,
allows for answering SPARQL queries modulo RDFS graphs with the same complexity
as SPARQL through a simple transformation of the queries. We also consider
languages which, in addition to paths, provide constraints. In particular, we
present and compare nSPARQL and our proposal CPSPARQL. We show that CPSPARQL is
expressive enough to answer full SPARQL queries modulo RDFS. Finally, we
compare the expressiveness and complexity of both nSPARQL and the corresponding
fragment of CPSPARQL, that we call cpSPARQL. We show that both languages have
the same complexity through cpSPARQL, being a proper extension of SPARQL graph
patterns, is more expressive than nSPARQL.

derivatives, which we use to classify functionals accordingly to their degree
of path-dependence. We then revisit the problem of efficient numerical
computation of Greeks for path-dependent derivatives using integration by parts
techniques. Special attention is paid to path-dependent functionals with zero
Lie bracket, called locally weakly path-dependent functionals in our

that, equipped with the functional It\^o calculus, we are able to analyze the
effect of the Lie bracket on the computation of Greeks. Moreover, we are also

several unexpected features from the simulations that build on our

behavior is observed that qualitatively differs from that predicted by the
model prediction; this is attributed to stochastic thermal motion of the Au
atoms and occurs at temperatures as low as 10 K. In addition, we also find that
the ductile-to-brittle model, which was developed using classical dislocation
theory, holds for nanowires as small as 3 nm in diameter. Finally, we
demonstrate that the nanowire critical length is higher at 298 K relative to 10
K, a result that is not predicted by the ductile-to-brittle model. These
results offer practical design strategies for adjusting nanowire failure and

Lie algebras exhibit patterns beyond Weyl-group symmetry. These patterns occur
because weight systems can be decomposed into lattice polytopes in a natural
way. Since lattice polytopes are relatively simple, this decomposition is
useful, in addition to being more economical than the decomposition into single
weights. An expansion of characters into polytope sums follows from the
polytope decomposition of weight systems. We study this polytope expansion
here. A new, general formula is given for the polytope sums involved. The
combinatorics of the polytope expansion are analyzed; we point out that they
are reduced from those of the Weyl character formula (described by the Kostant
partition function) in an optimal way. We also show that the weight
multiplicities can be found easily from the polytope multiplicities, indicating
explicitly the equivalence of the two descriptions. Finally, we demonstrate the
utility of the polytope expansion by showing how polytope multiplicities can be
used in the calculation of tensor product decompositions, and subalgebra
branching rules.

disks, which makes them good candidates for studies of the galactic vertical
kinematical structure. We present 21 cm line observations of the isolated
nearby dwarf irregular galaxy UGCA 105, taken with the Westerbork Synthesis
Radio Telescope (WSRT), and analyse the geometry of its neutral hydrogen (HI)
disk and its kinematics. The galaxy shows a fragmented HI distribution. It is
more extended than the optical disk, and hence allows one to determine its
kinematics out to very large galacto-centric distances. The HI kinematics and
morphology are well-ordered and symmetric for an irregular galaxy. The HI is
sufficiently extended to observe a substantial amount of differential rotation.
Moreover, UGCA 105 shows strong signatures for the presence of a kinematically
anomalous gas component. Performing tilted-ring modelling by use of the
least-squares fitting routine TiRiFiC, we found that the HI disk of UGCA 105
has a moderately warped and diffuse outermost part. Probing a wide range of
parameter combinations, we succeeded in modelling the data cube as a disk with
a strong vertical gradient in rotation velocity ($\approx -60\,\rm
km\,s^{-1}\,kpc^{-1}$), as well as vertically increasing inwards motion
($\approx -70\,\rm km\,s^{-1}\,kpc^{-1}$) within the radius of the stellar
disk. The inferred radial gas inflow amounts to $0.06\,\rm M_\odot \rm
yr^{-1}$, which is similar to the star formation rate of the galaxy. The
observed kinematics are hence compatible with direct or indirect accretion from
the intergalactic medium, an extreme backflow of material that has formerly
been expelled from the disk, or a combination of both.

of blue compact dwarf (BCD) and irregular galaxies in the Virgo cluster from
multi-band SDSS images. Our study intends to shed light on the ongoing debate
of whether a structural evolution from present-day star-forming dwarf galaxies
in a cluster environment into ordinary early-type dwarf galaxies is possible
based on the structural properties.
  For this purpose, we decompose the surface brightness profiles of the BCDs
into the luminosity contribution of the starburst component and that of their
underlying low surface brightness (LSB) host. The latter dominates the stellar
mass of the BCD. We find that the LSB-components of the Virgo BCDs are
structurally compatible with the more compact half of the Virgo early-type
dwarfs, except for a few extreme BCDs. Thus, after termination of starburst
activity, the BCDs will presumably fade into galaxies that are structurally
similar to ordinary early-type dwarfs. In contrast, the irregulars are more
diffuse than the BCDs and are structurally similar to the more diffuse half of
the Virgo early-type dwarfs. Therefore, the present-day Virgo irregulars are
not simply non-starbursting BCDs.
  If starbursts in cluster BCDs are transient phenomena with a duration of ~100
Myr or less, during which the galaxies could not travel more than ~100 kpc,
then a substantial number of non-starbursting counterparts of these systems
must populate the same spatial volume, namely the Virgo cluster outskirts. The
majority of them would have to be early-type dwarfs, based on the abundance of
different galaxy types with similar colours and structural parameters to the
LSB-components of the BCDs. However, most Virgo BCDs have redder LSB-host
colours and a less prominent starburst than typical field BCDs, preventing a
robust conclusion on possible oscillations between BCDs and early-type dwarfs.

luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at 1<z<3 are investigated with the
Galaxy Mass Assembly ultra-deep Spectroscopic Survey (GMASS) sample
complemented with public data in the GOODS-South field. Using X-ray data,
hidden AGNs are identified in unsuspected star-forming galaxies with no
apparent signs of non-stellar activity. In the color-mass plane, two parallel
trends emerge during the ~2 Gyr between the average redshifts z~2.2 and z~1.3:
while the red sequence becomes significantly more populated by ellipticals, the
majority of AGNs with L(2-10 keV)>10^42.3 erg s^-1 disappear from the blue
cloud/green valley where they were hosted predominantly by star-forming systems
with disk and irregular morphologies. These results are even clearer when the
rest-frame colors are corrected for dust reddening. At z~2.2, the ultraviolet
spectra of active galaxies (including two Type 1 AGNs) show possible gas
outflows with velocities up to about -500 km s^-1 that are not observed neither
in inactive systems at the same redshift, nor at lower redshifts. Such outflows
indicate the presence of gas that can move faster than the escape velocities of
active galaxies. These results suggest that feedback from moderately luminous
AGNs (logL_X<44.5 erg s^-1) played a key role at z>~2 by contributing to
outflows capable of ejecting part of the interstellar medium and leading to a
rapid decrease in the star formation in host galaxies with stellar masses
10<logM<11 M_Sun.

1$) and study the non-commutative symplectic geometry of the corresponding
doubles $\mathbf{Q}_{r}$. We show that the group of non-commutative
symplectomorphisms of the path algebra $\mathbb{C}\mathbf{Q}_{r}$ contains two
copies of the group $\mathrm{GL}_{r}$ over a ring of polynomials in one
indeterminate, and that a particular subgroup $\mathcal{P}_{r}$ (which contains
both of these copies) acts on the completion $\mathcal{C}_{n,r}$ of the phase
space of the $n$-particles, rank $r$ Gibbons-Hermsen integrable system and
connects each pair of points belonging to a certain dense open subset of
$\mathcal{C}_{n,r}$. This generalizes some known results for the cases $r=1$
and $r=2$.

"1311.4405","Shizhong Mei","Shizhong Mei","On the origin of preferred-basis and evolution pattern of wave function",,,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The standard quantum mechanics assumes Schr\""odinger equation for regular
evolution and wave function collapse for measurement. As shown in this paper,
only particular collapse equation can continuously transition to Schr\""odinge
equation. The collapse equation also adds some restriction to the
preferred-basis. Under the assumptions that the preferred-basis depends on the
whole system Hamiltonian but is not affected by the weights of the basis
functions in the system wave function, a unique set of determination equations
of the basis functions is derived from the collapse equation. The second order
time derivative of the wave function is continuous at the end of the collapse.
To make the derivative continuous at the beginning of the collapse, it is
proved that the collapse equation has to contain a cyclic function with period
twice the duration of the collapse, which leads to conditioned alternating
Schr\""odinger evolution and collapse of equal duration.

formalism of the imaginary-time field theory. From these effects, they could
imply the existence of one thermal vacuum in different circumstances. The
imaginary-time hamiltonian of the vacuum is found to provide not only exact
distribution functions in the calculations of the Casimir effect and the Van
der Waals force but also cutoff functions. The thermal bath for the Unruh
effect is constructed from the imaginary-time Green function. From the field
theory in the curved space-time, field quantizations are defined according to
different vacuum states and lead to the Hawking radiation; the introduced
conformal invariance agree with the formalism of the imaginary-time field
theory. The induced Green functions in the curved space-time are in accordance
with those from the picture given from the thermal vacuum.

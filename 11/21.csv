complex wind structures of supergiant stars of spectral types B and A.
Observational investigation of this hypothesis was undertaken using
high-resolution ({\lambda}/{\Delta}{\lambda} {\sim} 65,000) circular
polarization (Stokes V ) spectra of six late B and early A type supergiants
({\beta} Ori, B8Iae; 4 Lac, B9Iab; {\eta} Leo, A0Ib; HR1040, A0Ib; {\alpha}
Cyg, A2Iae; {\nu} Cep, A2Iab), obtained with the instruments ESPaDOnS and
Narval at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and the Bernard Lyot Telescope.
Least Squares Deconvolution (LSD) analysis of the Stokes V spectra of all stars
yields no evidence of a magnetic field, with best longitudinal field 1{\sigma}
error bars ranging from {\sim}0.5 to {\sim}4.5 G for most stars. Spectrum
synthesis analysis of the LSD profiles using Bayesian inference yields an upper
limit with 95.4% credibility on the polar strength of the (undetected) surface
dipole fields of individual stars ranging from 3 to 30 G. These results
strongly suggest that magnetic wind confinement due to organized dipolar
magnetic fields is not the origin of the wind variability of BA supergiant
stars. Upper limits for magnetic spots may also be inconsistent with magnetic
wind confinement in the limit of large spot size and filling factor, depending
on the adopted wind parameters. Therefore, if magnetic spots are responsible
for the wind variability of BA supergiant stars, they likely occupy a small
fraction of the photosphere.

Sr$_{1-x}$La$_x$FBiS$_2$ ($0\le x\le 0.6$) have been investigated using the
systematically synthesized polycrystals. The pristine compound is a band
insulator with the BiS$_2$ layer, which accommodates electron carriers through
the La substitution for Sr, as evidenced by the change in x-ray absorption
spectra reflecting the occupancy of Bi 6$p$ orbitals. With increasing the
carrier density, the resistivity progressively decreases and a bad metallic
state appears for $x\ge0.45$, where bulk superconductivity manifests itself
below approximately 3 K. The value of $T_{\rm c}$ gradually increases with
decreasing $x$ from 0.6 to 0.45 and immediately decreases down to zero at the
critical concentration of $x\sim 0.4$, resulting in an insulator-superconductor
transition highly sensitive to the carrier density. Thermodynamic measurements
furthermore have revealed the possible enhancement of the superconducting
coupling strength as the insulating phase is approached. The obtained
superconducting phase diagram is markedly different from the broad dome-shaped
superconducting phase previously reported for $R$O$_{1-x}$F$_x$BiS$_2$ ($R$:
rare-earth ion), suggesting a strong influence of the blocking layer on the
superconductivity. Instead all these features are similar to those observed in
Li-intercalated ZrNCl superconductor, except for the critical electron
concentration of as low as 6% in the latter compound. For the present
superconductor, notably, the existence of hole-type carriers has been indicated
in the normal state from the Hall effect measurements. The
Sr$_{1-x}$La$_x$FBiS$_2$ system providing the phase diagram for the rigid-band
doping in the BiS$_2$ layer would be another prototypical example of
superconductivity derived from a doped layered band insulator, hosting both

mortality risk have been proposed in the literature. Collectively, the
structures are called pooled annuity funds. Since the pooled annuity funds
propose different methods of pooling mortality risk, we investigate the
connections between them and find that they are genuinely different for a
finite heterogeneous membership profile.
  We discuss the importance of actuarial fairness, defined as the expected
benefits equalling the contributions for each member, in the context of pooling
mortality risk and comment on whether actuarial unfairness can be seen as
solidarity between members. We show that, with a finite number of members in
the fund, the group self-annuitization scheme is not actuarially fair: some
members subsidize the other members. The implication is that the members who
are subsidizing the others may obtain a higher expected benefit by joining a
fund with a more favourable membership profile. However, we find that the
subsidies are financially significant only for very small or highly
heterogeneous membership profiles.

pre-transitional disks. They present near-infrared excess coupled to a flux
deficit at about 10 microns and a rising mid-infrared and far-infrared
spectrum. These features suggest a disk structure with inner and outer dust
components, separated by a dust-depleted region (or gap). We here report on the
first interferometric observations of the disk around the Herbig Ae star HD
139614. Its infrared spectrum suggests a flared disk, and presents
pre-transitional features,namely a substantial near-infrared excess accompanied
by a dip around 6 microns and a rising mid-infrared part. In this framework, we
performed a study of the spectral energy distribution (SED) and the
mid-infrared VLTI/MIDI interferometric data to constrain thespatial structure
of the inner dust disk region and assess its possibly multi-component
structure. We based our work on a temperature-gradient disk model that includes
dust opacity. While we could not reproduce the SED and interferometric
visibilities with a one-component disk, a better agreement was obtained with a
two-component disk model composed of an optically thin inner disk extending
from 0.22 to 2.3 au, a gap, and an outer temperature-gradient disk starting at
5.6 au. Therefore, our modeling favors an extended and optically thin inner
dust component and in principle rules out the possibility that the
near-infrared excess originates only from a spatially confined region.
Moreover, the outer disk is characterized by a very steep temperature profile
and a temperature higher than 300 K at its inner edge. This suggests the
existence of a warm component corresponding to a scenario where the inner edge
of the outer disk is directly illuminated by the central star. This is an
expected consequence of the presence of a gap, thus indicative of a
pre-transitional structure.

particles whose presence may hint to an extended Higgs sector, typical of many

implemented in the ongoing searches by ATLAS and CMS. Indeed many effective
Lagrangians/parametrisations used at present for the description of the Higgs

typical examples falling in this category, in order to illustrate the use of

used to study hot extrasolar planet atmospheres (BOB, CAM, IGCM, MITgcm, and
PEQMOD), under three test cases useful for assessing model convergence and
accuracy. Such a broad, detailed intercomparison has not been performed thus
far for extrasolar planets study. The models considered all solve the
traditional primitive equations, but employ different numerical algorithms or
grids (e.g., pseudospectral and finite volume, with the latter separately in
longitude-latitude and `cubed-sphere' grids). The test cases are chosen to
cleanly address specific aspects of the behaviors typically reported in hot
extrasolar planet simulations: 1) steady-state, 2) nonlinearly evolving
baroclinic wave, and 3) response to fast timescale thermal relaxation. When
initialized with a steady jet, all models maintain the steadiness, as they
should -- except MITgcm in cubed-sphere grid. A very good agreement is obtained
for a baroclinic wave evolving from an initial instability in pseudospectral
models (only). However, exact numerical convergence is still not achieved
across the pseudospectral models: amplitudes and phases are observably
different. When subject to a typical `hot-Jupiter'-like forcing, all five
models show quantitatively different behavior -- although qualitatively
similar, time-variable, quadrupole-dominated flows are produced. Hence, as have
been advocated in several past studies, specific quantitative predictions (such
as the location of large vortices and hot regions) by GCMs should be viewed
with caution. Overall, in the tests considered here, pseudospectral models in
pressure coordinate (PEBOB and PEQMOD) perform the best and MITgcm in
cubed-sphere grid performs the worst.

surface constructed by randomly gluing together an even number of triangles. We
study two types of metrics on these surfaces, the first one coming from using
ideal hyperbolic triangles and the second one using triangles that carry a
given Riemannian metric.
  In the hyperbolic case we compute the limit of the expected value of the
systole when the number of triangles goes to infinity (approximately 2.484). We
also determine the asymptotic probability distribution of the number of curves
of any finite length. This turns out to be a Poisson distribution.
  In the Riemannian case we give an upper bound to the limit supremum and a
lower bound to the limit infimum of the expected value of the systole depending
only on the metric on the triangle. We also show that this upper bound is sharp
in the sense that there is a sequence of metrics for which the limit infimum
comes arbitrarily close to the upper bound.
  The main tool we use is random regular graphs. One of the difficulties in the
proof of the limits is controlling the probability that short closed curves are
separating. To do this we first prove that the probability that a random cubic
graph has a short separating circuit tends to 0 for the number of vertices
going to infinity and show that this holds for circuits of a length up to
$\log_2$ of the number of vertices.

the ocean begins to freeze, driving chemical separation. The resulting
convection transports heat inward, giving much faster cooling of the surface
layers than found assuming the ocean cools passively. The light curves
including convection show a rapid drop in temperature weeks after outburst.
Identifying this signature in observed cooling curves would constrain the
temperature and composition of the ocean as well as offer a real time probe of

Solar Dynamics Observatory's (SDO) Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) at high
cadence. The ejection was accompanied by a GOES M1.0 soft X-ray flare and a
Type-II radio burst; high-resolution dynamic spectra of the latter were
obtained by the ARTEMIS IV radio spectrograph. The combined observations
enabled a study of the evolution of the ejecta and the EUV wavefront and its
relationship with the coronal shock manifesting itself as metric Type-II burst.
By introducing a novel technique, which deduces a proxy of the EUV compression
ratio from AIA imaging data and compares it with the compression ratio deduced
from the band-split of the Type-II metric radio burst, we are able to infer the
potential source locations of the radio emission of the shock on that AIA
images. Our results indicate that the expansion of the CME ejecta is the source
for both EUV and radio shock emissions. Early in the CME expansion phase, the
Type-II burst seems to originate in the sheath region between the EUV bubble
and the EUV shock front in both radial and lateral directions. This suggests
that both the nose and the flanks of the expanding bubble could have driven the
shock.

In SrTiO$_3$ they are believed to be the main donors in an otherwise intrinsic
crystal. At the same time, a relatively deep gap state associated with the
vacancy is widely reported. To explain this inconsistency we investigate the
effect of electron correlation in an oxygen vacancy (OV) in SrTiO$_3$. When
taking correlation into account, we find that the OV-induced localized level
can at most trap one electron, while the second electron occupies the
conduction band. Our results offer a natural explanation of how the OV in
SrTiO$_3$ can produce a deep in-gap level (about 1 eV below the conduction band
bottom) in photoemission, and at the same time be an electron donor. Our
analysis implies an OV in SrTiO$_3$ should be fundamentally regarded as a
magnetic impurity, whose deep level is always partially occupied due to the
strong Coulomb repulsion. An OV-based Anderson impurity model is derived, and
its implications are discussed.

We also observe variable eclipses when the companion passes near our line of

phases, and short-term disappearances of signal at random orbital phases. We
interpret the eclipses as possibly due to material in the companion's
magnetosphere supported by magnetic pressure, and the orbital period variations
as possibly due to a gravitational quadrupole coupling mechanism. Both of these
mechanisms would be the result of magnetic activity in the companion, in
conflict with evolutionary models that predict it should be fully convective
and hence non-magnetic. We also use our timing data to test for orbital and
rotational modulation of the system's $\gamma$-ray emission, finding no
evidence for orbital modulation and $3.7\sigma$ evidence for modulation at the
pulsar period. The energetics of the system make it plausible that the
$\gamma$-ray emission we observe is entirely from the millisecond pulsar
itself, but it seems unlikely for these $\gamma$-rays to provide the
irradiation of the companion, which we attribute instead to X-ray heating from
a shock powered by a particle wind.

reflection off the inner accretion disc. In this letter, we report the
discovery of the Fe K lag in PG 1244+026 from ~120 ks of data (1 orbit of the
XMM-Newton telescope). The amplitude of the lag with respect to the continuum
is 1000 s at a frequency of ~1e-4 Hz. We also find a possible
frequency-dependence of the line: as we probe higher frequencies (i.e. shorter
timescales from a smaller emitting region) the Fe K lag peaks at the red wing
of the line, while at lower frequencies (from a larger emitting region) we see
the dominant reflection lag from the rest frame line centroid. The mean energy
spectrum shows a strong soft excess, though interestingly, there is no
indication of a soft lag. Given that this source has radio emission and it has
little reported correlated variability between the soft excess and the hard
band, we explore one possible explanation in which the soft excess in this
source is dominated by the steep power-law like emission from a jet, and that a
corona (or base of the jet) irradiates the inner accretion disc, creating the
blurred reflection features evident in the spectrum and the lag. General
Relativistic ray-tracing models fit the Fe K lag well, with the best-fit giving

consistent with the propagation of fluctuations model, with some long-timescale
response of the reflection component. The high frequency soft lag appears to
extend over a wide frequency band, that we divide this into two narrow
frequency ranges, and examine the lag as a function of energy for each of
these. At high frequencies the soft excess emission is delayed with respect to
the harder energy bands, without any corresponding strong, hard X-ray
reflection signature. At even higher frequencies a soft lag is seen at the
softest energies, as well as tentative evidence for an iron K$\alpha$
reverberation signal. These results point to the importance of reprocessing as

various aspects of their evolution and interaction with the interstellar medium
(ISM). Since the observed samples of SNRs are a collection of objects with very
different ages and origin that evolve in different conditions of the ISM,
statistical Monte Carlo methods can be used to model their statistical
distributions. Based on very general assumptions on the evolution, we have
modeled samples of SNRs at various initial and environmental conditions, which
were then compared with observed collections of SNRs. In the evolution of SNRs
the pressure of the ISM is taken into account, which determines their maximum
sizes and lifetimes. When comparing the modeled and observed distributions, it
is very important to have homogeneous observational data free from selection
effects. We found that a recently published collection of SNRs in M33 (Long et
al. 2010, ApJS,187,495) satisfies this requirement if we select the X-ray SNRs
with hardness ratios in a limited range of values. An excellent agreement
between distributions of this subset of SNRs and the subset of modeled SNRs was
reached for a volume filling-factor of the warm phase of the ISM (partly
ionized gas with $n_{\rm H}\sim 0.2-0.5~ \rm {cm}^{-3}; T \sim 8000-10000~K $)
in M33 of $\sim\ 90%$. The statistical distributions constructed in this way,
which reproduce practically all the statistical properties of observed SNRs,
allowed us to obtain one of the important parameters of M33: the birthrate is
one SNR every $ {140} - {150}$ yr, and the total number of SNRs with a shock
Mach number $M_{s} \geq 2$ is larger than $\sim 1000$.

can be constant or can depend on the impact velocity (which is a more

parameter is sufficiently small, we prove existence of global solutions
considering the close-to-equilibrium regime as well as the weakly inhomogeneous
regime in the case of a constant restitution coefficient. It is the very first
existence theorem of global solution in an inelastic ""collision regime"" (that
is excluding \cite{AR} where an existence theorem is proven in a near to the
vacuum regime). We also study the long-time behavior of these solutions and
prove a convergence to equilibrium with an exponential rate. The basis of the
proof is the study of the linearized equation. We obtain a new result on it, we
prove existence of a spectral gap in weighted (stretched exponential and
polynomial) Sobolev spaces and a result of exponential stability for the
semigroup generated by the linearized operator. To do that, we develop a
perturbative argument around the spatially inhomogeneous equation for elastic
hard spheres and we take advantage of the recent paper \cite{GMM}where this
equation has been considered. We then link the linearized theory with the
nonlinear one in order to handle the full non-linear problem thanks to new
bilinear estimates on the collision operator that we establish. As far as the
case of a constant coefficient is concerned, the present paper largely improves
similar results obtained in \cite{MM2} in a spatially homogeneous framework.
Concerning the case of a non-constant coefficient, this kind of results is new

The controlled setting of cold atom experiments provides a new avenue to

superconducting thin films [2,3]. Here we investigate a strongly interacting
thin film of an atomic Fermi gas subject to a random potential. We use
high-resolution in-situ imaging [4-7] to resolve the atomic density at the

techniques in solid state physics [8]. This allows us to directly observe the
fragmentation of the density profile and to extract its percolation properties.
Transport measurements in a two-terminal configuration indicate that the

These results are then expressed as packing fraction power series and
transformed to different reference regions which is equivalent to consider
different positions of the dividing surface. All the obtained series expansions
are rigorous results. Based on the truncated series it is shown that the
bending rigidity of the system is non-null and that higher order terms in the

correctly recover the support with high probability for $s_0\le K\sqrt{n}$
(assuming $n$ of the same order as $p$). We prove this conjecture, and in fact
establish a more general guarantee including higher-rank as well as $n$ much
smaller than $p$. Recent lower bounds \cite{berthet2013computational,
ma2015sum} suggest that no polynomial time algorithm can do significantly
better. The key technical component of our analysis develops new bounds on the
norm of kernel random matrices, in regimes that were not considered before.

fast/slow system with one fast variable (corresponding to ice volume) and two

perturbation theory is used to demonstrate the existence of a folded node
singularity. A parameter regime is found in which (singular) trajectories that
pass through the folded node are returned to the singular funnel in the
limiting case where $\epsilon = 0$. In this parameter regime, the model has a
stable periodic orbit of type $1^s$ for some $s>0$. To our knowledge, it is the
first conceptual climate model demonstrated to have the capability to produce
an MMO pattern.

users has to be very low due to the restrictions on the tolerable interference
power dictated by primary users. In order to extend the coverage area of
secondary transmission and reduce the corresponding interference region,
multi-hop amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying can be implemented for the
communication between secondary transmitters and receivers. This paper
addresses the fundamental limits of this promising technique. Specifically, the
effect of major system parameters on the performance of spectrum-sharing
multi-hop AF relaying is investigated. To this end, the optimal transmit power
allocation at each node along the multi-hop link is firstly addressed. Then,
the extreme value theory is exploited to study the limiting distribution
functions of the lower and upper bounds on the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio
of the relaying path. Our results disclose that the diversity gain of the
multi-hop link is always unity, regardless of the number of relaying hops. On
the other hand, the coding gain is proportional to the water level of the
optimal water-filling power allocation at secondary transmitter and to the
large-scale path-loss ratio of the desired link to the interference link at
each hop, yet is inversely proportional to the accumulated noise, i.e. the
product of the number of relays and the noise variance, at the destination.
These important findings do not only shed light on the performance of the
secondary transmissions but also benefit system designers improving the
efficiency of future spectrum-sharing cooperative systems.

demonstrate that the bifurcation---whether leading to canards or

to a one-dimensional map in the infinite population limit. Stochastic
fluctuations are hence intrinsic to the system and can induce qualitative
changes to the dynamics predicted from the deterministic map. From the
Chapman-Kolmogorov equation for the discrete-time Markov process, we derive the
analogues of the Fokker-Planck equation and the Langevin equation, which are
routinely employed for continuous time processes. In particular, a stochastic
difference equation is derived which accurately reproduces the results found
from the Markov chain model. Stochastic corrections to the deterministic map
can be quantified by linearizing the fluctuations around the attractor of the

short key to (un)lock an arbitrarily long message encoded in a quantum state,
in such a way that an eavesdropper who measures the state but does not know the
key has essentially no information about the encrypted message. The application
of quantum data locking in cryptography would allow one to overcome the
limitations of the one-time pad encryption, which requires the key to have the
same length as the message. However, it is known that the strength of quantum
data locking is also its Achilles heel, as the leakage of a few bits of the key
or the message may in principle allow the eavesdropper to unlock a
disproportionate amount of information. In this paper we show that there exist
quantum data locking schemes that can be made robust against information
leakage by increasing the length of the shared key by a proportionate amount.
This implies that a constant size key can still encrypt an arbitrarily long
message as long as a fraction of it remains secret to the eavesdropper.
Moreover, we greatly simplify the structure of the protocol by proving that
phase modulation suffices to generate strong locking schemes, paving the way to
optical experimental realizations. Also, we show that successful data locking
protocols can be constructed using random codewords, which very well could be
helpful in discovering random codes for data locking over noisy quantum
channels.

protoplanetary disk to spiral in toward the host star on short timescales is
one of the fundamental problems in planet formation theory. The nominal
efficiency of this radial drift process is in conflict with observations,
suggesting that an empirical calibration of solid transport mechanisms in a
disk is highly desirable. However, the fact that both radial drift and grain
growth produce a similar particle size segregation in a disk (such that larger
particles are preferentially concentrated closer to the star) makes it
difficult to disentangle a clear signature of drift alone. We highlight a new
approach, by showing that radial drift leaves a distinctive ""fingerprint"" in
the dust surface density profile that is directly accessible to current
observational facilities. Using an analytical framework for dust evolution, we
demonstrate that the combined effects of drift and (viscous) gas drag naturally
produce a sharp outer edge in the dust distribution (or, equivalently, a sharp
decrease in the dust-to-gas mass ratio). This edge feature forms during the
earliest phase in the evolution of disk solids, before grain growth in the
outer disk has made much progress, and is preserved over longer timescales when
both growth and transport effects are more substantial. The key features of
these analytical models are reproduced in detailed numerical simulations, and
are qualitatively consistent with recent millimeter-wave observations that find
gas/dust size discrepancies and steep declines in dust continuum emission in
the outer regions of protoplanetary disks.

can be well constrained from sets of multiple images of various background
galaxies with measured redshifts, its value is typically dependent on the
fiducial set of cosmological parameters used to construct the mass model to
begin with. In such cases, one should not naively demagnify the observed SN
luminosity by the model magnification into the expected Hubble diagram, which
would then create a bias, but take into account the cosmological parameters
a-priori chosen to construct the mass model. We quantify the effect and find
that a systematic error of typically a few percent, up to a few-dozen percent,
per magnified SN, may be propagated onto a cosmological parameter fit, unless
the cosmology assumed for the mass model is taken into account (the bias can be
even larger if the SN is lying very near the critical curves). We also simulate
how such a bias propagates onto the cosmological parameter fit using the
Union2.1 sample, supplemented with strongly magnified SNe. The resulting bias
on the deduced cosmological parameters is generally at the few percent level,
if only few biased SNe are included, and increasing with the number of lensed
SNe and their redshift. Samples containing magnified Type Ia SNe, e.g. from
ongoing cluster surveys, should readily account for this possible bias.

haloes, and are the backbone for modeling galaxy formation and evolution.
Merger trees constructed using Monte Carlo algorithms based on the extended
Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism are complementary to those extracted from
N-body simulations, and have the advantage that they are not trammeled by
limited numerical resolution and uncertainties in identifying (sub)haloes and
linking them between snapshots. This paper compares multiple EPS-based merger
tree algorithms to simulation results using four diagnostics: progenitor mass
function (PMF), mass assembly history (MAH), merger rate per descendant halo,
and the unevolved subhalo mass function (USMF). In general, algorithms based on
spherical collapse yield major-merger rates that are too high by a factor of
two, resulting in MAHs that are systematically offset. Assuming ellipsoidal
collapse solves most of these issues, but the particular algorithm investigated
here that incorporates ellipsoidal collapse dramatically overpredicts the
minor-merger rate for massive haloes. The only algorithm in our comparison that
yields MAHs, merger rates, and USMFs in good agreement with simulations, is
that by Parkinson et al. (2008). However, this is not a true EPS-based
algorithm as it draws its progenitor masses from a PMF calibrated against
simulations, rather than `predicted' by EPS. Finally we emphasize that the
benchmarks used to test the EPS algorithms are obtained from simulations and
are hampered by significant uncertainties themselves. In particular, MAHs and
halo merger rates obtained from simulations by different authors reveal
discrepancies that easily exceed 50 percent, even when based on the same
simulation. Given this status quo, merger trees constructed using the Parkinson
et al. algorithm are as accurate as those extracted from N-body simulations.

colors, and absolute magnitudes equivalent to galaxies undetected in SPIRE.
Though many Herschel galaxies appear to be in transition, such galaxies are
largely consistent with normal star-forming galaxies when rest-frame colors are
utilized. The nature of the star-forming ""main sequence"" is studied and we warn
against adopting this framework unless the main sequence is determined
precisely. Herschel galaxies at different total infrared luminosities
($L_{TIR}$) are compared. Bluer colors, larger nebular extinctions, and larger
contributions from younger stellar populations are observed for galaxies with
larger $L_{TIR}$, suggesting that low-$L_{TIR}$ galaxies are undergoing
rejuvenated starbursts while galaxies with higher $L_{TIR}$ are forming a
larger percentage of their stellar mass. A variety of methods are used to
select powerful active galactic nuclei (AGN). Galaxies hosting AGN are observed
to be undergoing starbursts more commonly and vigorously than a matched sample
of galaxies without powerful AGN and, additionally, the fraction of galaxies
with an AGN increases with increasing star formation rate at all redshifts. At
all redshifts ($0<z<4$) the most prodigious star-forming galaxies are found to
contain the highest fraction of powerful AGN. For redshift bins that allow a
comparison ($z>0.5$), the highest $L_{TIR}$ galaxies in a given redshift bin
are unobserved by SPIRE at subsequently lower redshifts, a trend linked to
downsizing. In conjunction with other results, this evidence is used to argue

a diverse population of extrasolar multi-planet systems. A common technique for
characterizing the orbital elements of these planets is Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC), using a Keplerian model with random walk proposals and paired
with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. For approximately a couple of dozen
planetary systems with Doppler observations, there are strong planet-planet
interactions due to the system being in or near a mean-motion resonance (MMR).
An N-body model is often required to accurately describe these systems. Further
computational difficulties arise from exploring a high-dimensional parameter
space ($\sim$7 x number of planets) that can have complex parameter
correlations. To surmount these challenges, we introduce a differential

self-consistent N-body integrations. Our Radial velocity Using N-body DEMCMC

along with results of tests for accuracy and performance. We find that most
algorithm parameters have a modest effect on the rate of convergence. However,
the size of the ensemble can have a strong effect on performance. We show that
the optimal choice depends on the number of planets in a system, as well as the
computer architecture used and the resulting extent of parallelization. While
the exact choices of optimal algorithm parameters will inevitably vary due to
the details of individual planetary systems, we offer recommendations for
choosing the DEMCMC algorithm's algorithmic parameters that result in excellent
performance for a wide variety of planetary systems.

function (IMF) of stars varies systematically with galaxy properties such as
velocity dispersion. In this paper, we investigate the effect of linking the
circular velocity of galaxies, as determined from the Fundamental Plane and
Tully-Fisher relations, to the slope of the IMF with parameterizations guided
by several of these studies. For each empirical relation, we generate stellar
masses of ~600,000 SDSS galaxies at z ~ 0.1, by fitting the optical photometry
to large suites of synthetic stellar populations that sample the full range of
galaxy parameters. We generate stellar mass functions and examine the
stellar-to-halo mass relations using sub-halo abundance matching. At the
massive end, the stellar mass functions become a power law, instead of the
familiar exponential decline. As a result, it is a generic feature of these
models that the central galaxy stellar-to-halo mass relation is significantly
flatter at high masses (slope ~ -0.3 to -0.4) than in the case of a universal
IMF (slope ~ -0.6). We find that regardless of whether the IMF varies
systematically in all galaxies or just early types, there is still a
well-defined peak in the central stellar-to-halo mass ratio at halo masses of ~
10E12 solar masses. In general, the IMF variations explored here lead to
significantly higher integrated stellar densities if the assumed dependence on
circular velocity applies to all galaxies, including late-types; in fact the
more extreme cases can be ruled out, as they imply an unphysical situation in
which the stellar fraction exceeds the universal baryon fraction.

we show that the system exhibits Chern-insulating phases with quantized Hall
conductivities $\pm e^2/h$. The chirality of the corresponding gapless edge
modes is controllable by both the frequency of the driving and the manner in
which sublattice symmetry is broken by the dynamical lattice modulations.
Finally, we discuss a promising possible realization of this physics in

characterization of the phases and phase-boundaries in the presence of strong

using an explicit 1-dimensional disordered topological model, we show that
$\nu$ remains quantized and non-fluctuating when disorder is turned on, even
though the bulk energy-spectrum is completely localized. Furthermore, $\nu$
remains robust even after the insulating gap is filled with localized states,
but when the disorder is increased even further, an abrupt change of $\nu$ to a
trivial value is observed. Using exact analytic calculations, we show that this
marks a critical point where the localization length diverges. As such, in the
presence of disorder, the AIII class displays a markedly different physics from
everything known to date, with robust invariants being carried entirely by
localized states and bulk extended states emerging from an absolutely localized
spectrum. Detailed maps and a clear physical description of the phases and

jet algorithm to cluster the final state and then veto on jets. Jet clustering
induces logarithmic dependence on the jet radius R in the cross section for
exclusive jet bins, a dependence that is poorly controlled due to the
non-global nature of the clustering. At jet radii of experimental interest, the
leading order (LO) clustering effects are numerically significant, but the
higher order effects are currently unknown. We rectify this situation by
calculating the most important part of the next-to-leading order (NLO)
clustering logarithms of R for any 0-jet process, which enter as
$O(\alpha_s^3)$ corrections to the cross section. The calculation blends
subtraction methods for NLO calculations with factorization properties of QCD
and soft-collinear effective theory (SCET). We compare the size of the known LO

the 0-jet cross section in Higgs production is small. This brings clustering
effects under better control and may be used to improve uncertainty estimates

of the most convincing cases for the existence of circumbinary planets around
evolved binaries. The exquisite timing precision provided by the deep eclipse
of the white dwarf has revealed complex variations in the eclipse arrival times
over the last few decades. These variations have been interpreted as the
influence of two planets in orbit around the binary. Recent studies have proved
that such a system is dynamically stable over the current lifetime of the
binary. However, the existence of such planets is by no means proven and
several alternative mechanisms have been proposed that could drive similar
variations. One of these is apsidal precession, which causes the eclipse times
of eccentric binaries to vary sinusoidally on many year timescales. In this
paper we present timing data for the secondary eclipse of NN Ser and show that
they follow the same trend seen in the primary eclipse times, ruling out
apsidal precession as a possible cause for the variations. This result leaves
no alternatives to the planetary interpretation for the observed period
variations, although we still do not consider their existence as proven. Our
data limits the eccentricity of NN Ser to e<0.001. We also detect a 3.3+/-1.0
second delay in the arrival times of the secondary eclipses relative to the
best planetary model. This delay is consistent with the expected 2.84+/-0.04
second Romer delay of the binary, and is the first time this effect has been
detected in a white dwarf plus M dwarf system.

calculated assuming the accretion disk wind (ADW) scenario. The results suggest
that the multiple absorption troughs seen in many QSOs may be due to the
discontinuities in the ion balance of the wind (caused by X-rays), rather than
discontinuities in the density/velocity structure. The profiles are calculated
from a 2.5D time-dependent hydrodynamic simulation of a line-driven disk wind
for a typical QSO black hole mass, a typical QSO luminosity, and for a standard
Shakura-Sunyaev disk. We include the effects of ionizing X-rays originating
from within the inner disk radius by assuming that the wind is shielded from
the X-rays from a certain viewing angle up to 90o (""edge on""). In the shielded
region we assume constant ionization equilibrium, and thus constant line-force
parameters. In the non-shielded region we assume that both the line-force and
the C+3 populations are nonexistent. The model, at viewing angles close to the
angle that separates the shielded region and the non-shielded region, produces
absorption lines with multiple troughs. The steady nature of accretion disk
winds, in turn, may account for the steady nature of the absorption structure
observed in multiple-trough broad absorption line QSOs. The model parameters
are Mbh = 10^9 Msun and Ldisk = 10^47 erg s-1.

the master equations describing the evolution of linear perturbations in a

simulate several configurations of physical interest, such as relativistic
corrections to structure formation, the lensing of gravitational waves and the
evolution of perturbations in a cosmological void model. This paper focuses on
the latter problem, i.e. structure formation in a Hubble scale void in the
linear regime. This is considerably more complicated than linear perturbations
of a homogeneous and isotropic background because the inhomogeneous background
leads to coupling between density perturbations and rotational modes of the
spacetime geometry, as well as gravitational waves. Previous analyses of this
problem ignored this coupling in the hope that the approximation does not
affect the overall dynamics of structure formation in such models. We show that
for a giga-parsec void, the evolution of the density contrast is well
approximated by the previously studied decoupled evolution only for very
large-scale modes. However, the evolution of the gravitational potentials
within the void is inaccurate at more than the $10\%$ level, and is even worse

near simultaneous large fast coronal mass ejection (CME), are the most powerful
explosions and also the most powerful and energetic particle accelerators in
the solar system, producing solar energetic particles (SEPs) up to tens of GeV
for ions and hundreds of MeV for electrons. The intense fluxes of escaping SEPs
are a major hazard for humans in space and for spacecraft. Furthermore, the
solar plasma ejected at high speed in the fast CME completely restructures the
interplanetary medium (IPM) - major SEEs therefore produce the most extreme
space weather in geospace, the interplanetary medium, and at other planets.
Thus, understanding the flare/CME energy release process(es) and the related

next major breakthroughs, we propose a new mission concept, SEE 2020, a single

the largest GRB fluence ever recorded. The afterglow of GRB 130427A was bright
enough for the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope ARray (NuSTAR) to observe it in
the 3-79 keV energy range long after its prompt emission (~1.5 and 5 days).
This range, where afterglow observations were previously not possible, bridges
an important spectral gap. Combined with Swift, Fermi and ground-based optical
data, NuSTAR observations unambiguously establish a single afterglow spectral
component from optical to multi-GeV energies a day after the event, which is
almost certainly synchrotron radiation. Such an origin of the late-time
Fermi/LAT > 10 GeV photons requires revisions in our understanding of
collisionless relativistic shock physics.

gravitational pull on the Local Group, estimating the large-scale bulk flow and
testing the Copernican principle. However, the largest all-sky redshift surveys
-- the 2MRS and IRAS PSCz -- have median redshifts of only z=0.03 and sample
the very local Universe. There exist all-sky galaxy catalogs reaching much
deeper -- SuperCOSMOS in the optical, 2MASS in the near-IR and WISE in the
mid-IR -- but these lack complete redshift information. At present, the only
rapid way towards larger 3D catalogs covering the whole sky is through
photometric redshift techniques. In this paper we present the 2MASS Photometric
Redshift catalog (2MPZ) containing 1 million galaxies, constructed by
cross-matching 2MASS XSC, WISE and SuperCOSMOS all-sky samples and employing
the artificial neural network approach (the ANNz algorithm), trained on such
redshift surveys as SDSS, 6dFGS and 2dFGRS. The derived photometric redshifts
have errors nearly independent of distance, with an all-sky accuracy of
sigma_z=0.015 and a very small percentage of outliers. In this way, we obtain
redshift estimates with a typical precision of 12% for all the 2MASS XSC
galaxies that lack spectroscopy. In addition, we have made an early effort
towards probing the entire 3D sky beyond 2MASS, by pairing up WISE with
SuperCOSMOS and training the ANNz on GAMA redshift data reaching currently to
z_med~0.2. This has yielded photo-z accuracies comparable to those in the 2MPZ.
These all-sky photo-z catalogs, with a median z~0.1 for the 2MPZ, and
significantly deeper for future WISE-based samples, will be the largest and
most complete of their kind for the foreseeable future.

Their
origin is unclear; their study has been limited by their small number. We
undertook a systematic search for minihalos in a large sample of X-ray luminous
clusters with high-quality radio data. In this paper, we report four new
minihalos (A 478, ZwCl 3146, RXJ 1532.9+3021 and A 2204), and five candidates,
found in the reanalyzed archival Very Large Array observations. The radio
luminosities of our minihalos and candidates are in the range $10^{23-25}$ W
Hz$^{-1}$ at 1.4 GHz, consistent with this type of radio sources. Their sizes
(40-160 kpc in radius) are somewhat smaller than those of the previously known
minihalos. We combine our new detections with previously known minihalos,
obtaining a total sample of 21 objects, and briefly compare the cluster radio
properties to the average X-ray temperature and the total masses estimated from
Planck. We find that nearly all clusters hosting minihalos are hot and massive.
Beyond that, there is no clear correlation between the minihalo radio power and
cluster temperature or mass (in contrast with the giant radio halos found in
cluster mergers, whose radio luminosity correlates with the cluster mass).
Chandra X-ray images indicate gas sloshing in the cool cores of most of our
clusters, with minihalos contained within the sloshing regions in many of them.
This supports the hypothesis that radio-emitting electrons are reaccelerated by
sloshing. Advection of relativistic electrons by the sloshing gas may also play
a role in the formation of the less-extended minihalos.

respect to the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB), free electrons in

in the CMB via the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect. By modeling the
distribution of gas in the LG halo and using its inferred velocity with respect

We find that it is dominated by a hot spot $\sim 10^\circ$ in size in the

performing a correlation analysis, we find no statistical evidence that the kSZ
signal from model of the LG halo is embedded in the CMB temperature map
measured by the Planck satellite. We constrain the amount of mass in the LG
halo by limiting the kSZ temperature shift around the hot spot to be smaller
than the observed temperature shift in the Planck map. We find the tightest
constraints for models where the halo mass is highly concentrated, with the
mass limited to roughly $2.5-5\times 10^{12}$M$_\odot$, but note that halos
with such high concentrations are rare.

suitable for stabilised, fibre-fed spectrographs and does not model the spatial
profile shape. A high signal-to-noise, master-flat image serves as reference
image and is directly used as an extraction profile mask. Each extracted
spectral value is the scaling factor relative to the cross-section of the
unnormalised master-flat which contains all information about the spatial
profile as well as pixel-to-pixel variations, fringing, and blaze. The
extracted spectrum is measured relative to the flat spectrum. Using echelle
spectra of the HARPS spectrograph we demonstrate a competitive extraction
performance in terms of signal-to-noise and show that extracted spectra can be
used for high precision radial velocity measurement. Pre- or post-flat-fielding
of the data is not necessary, since all spectrograph inefficiencies inherent to
the extraction mask are automatically accounted for. Also the reconstruction of
the mean spatial profile by models is not needed, thereby reducing the number
of operations to extract spectra. Flat-relative optimal extraction is a simple,
efficient, and robust method that can be applied easily to stabilised,
fibre-fed spectrographs.

a correctly sampled Initial Mass Function (IMF) and in this contribution we
provide a solid mathematical method called MASSCLEAN IMF Sampling for doing so.
We then use our method to perform $10$ $million$ MASSCLEAN Monte Carlo stellar
cluster simulations to determine the most massive star in a mass distribution
as a function of the total mass of the cluster. We find a maximum mass range is
predicted, not a single maximum mass. This maximum mass range is (a) dependent
on the total mass of the cluster and (b) independent of an upper stellar mass
limit, $M_{limit}$, for $unsaturated$ clusters and comes out naturally using
our IMF sampling method. We then turn our analysis around, now starting with
our new $25$ $million$ simulated cluster database, to constrain the highest
mass star from the observed integrated colors of a sample of 40 low-mass LMC
stellar clusters of known age and mass. Finally, we present an analytical
description of the maximum mass range of the most massive star as a function of
the cluster's total mass, and present a new $M_{max}-M_{cluster}$ relation.

vexing problem that underlies a range of problems in experimental physics and
quantum information theory. Recently, a method called quantum Hamiltonian
learning has been proposed by the present authors that uses quantum simulation
as a resource for modeling an unknown quantum system. This approach can, under
certain circumstances, allow such models to be efficiently identified. A major
caveat of that work is the assumption of that all elements of the protocol are
noise-free. Here, we show that quantum Hamiltonian learning can tolerate
substantial amounts of depolarizing noise and show numerical evidence that it
can tolerate noise drawn from other realistic models. We further provide
evidence that the learning algorithm will find a model that is maximally close
to the true model in cases where the hypothetical model lacks terms present in
the true model. Finally, we also provide numerical evidence that the algorithm
works for non-commuting models. This work illustrates that quantum Hamiltonian
learning can be performed using realistic resources and suggests that even
imperfect quantum resources may be valuable for characterizing quantum systems.

either qualitatively or quantitatively, is a process in which it should be
possible to identify not only the concepts and contents students failed to
achieve but also the reasons of the failure. We propose that students' video
production offers a very effective formative assessment to teachers: as a
formative assessment, it produces information that allows the understanding of
where and when the learning process succeeded or failed, of identifying, as a
subject or as a group, the defficiencies or misunderstandings related to the
theme under analysis and their interpretation by students, and it provides also
a different kind of assessment, related to some other life skills, like the
ability to carry a project to its conclusion and to work cooperatively. In this
paper, we describe the use of videos produced by high school students as an
assessment resource. The students were asked to prepare a short video, which
was then presented to the whole group and discussed. The videos reveal aspects
of students' difficulties that usually do not appear in formal assessments such
as tests and questionnaires. After the use of the videos as an component of
classroom assessments and the use of the discussions to rethink learning
activities in the group, the videos were analysed and classified in various
categories. This analysis showed a strong correlation between the technical
quality of the video and the content quality of the students argumentation.
Also, it was shown that the students don't prepare their video based on quick
and easy production, they usually choose forms of video production that require
careful planning and implementation, and this reflects directly on the overall
quality of the video and of the learning process.

extensive simulation study in an attempt to compare their finite sample

algebraic geometry - the study of polynomial inequalities and equations over
the real numbers - with a focus on matrix convex sets $C$ and their projections
$\hat C$. A free semialgebraic set which is convex as well as bounded and open
can be represented as the solution set of a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI), a
result which suggests that convex free semialgebraic sets are rare. Further,
Tarski's transfer principle fails in the free setting: The projection of a free
convex semialgebraic set need not be free semialgebraic. Both of these results,
and the importance of convex approximations in the optimization community,
provide impetus and motivation for the study of the free (matrix) convex hull
of free semialgebraic sets.
  This article presents the construction of a sequence $C^{(d)}$ of LMI domains
in increasingly many variables whose projections $\hat C^{(d)}$ are
successively finer outer approximations of the matrix convex hull of a free
semialgebraic set $D_p=\{X: p(X)\succeq0\}$. It is based on free analogs of
moments and Hankel matrices. Such an approximation scheme is possibly the best
that can be done in general. Indeed, natural noncommutative transcriptions of
formulas for certain well known classical (commutative) convex hulls does not
produce the convex hulls in the free case. This failure is illustrated on one
of the simplest free nonconvex $D_p$.
  A basic question is which free sets $\hat S$ are the projection of a free
semialgebraic set $S$? Techniques and results of this paper bear upon this
question which is open even for convex sets.

the Bouligand-Minkowski method due to its precision in quantifying structural

sense of Christensen) if there exists a Borel set $\mathcal{B}\subset C[0,1]$
and a Borel probability measure $\mu$ on $C[0,1]$ such that $\mathcal{A}\subset
\mathcal{B}$ and $\mu\left(\mathcal{B}+f\right) = 0$ for all $f \in C[0,1]$.
The complement of a shy set is called a \emph{prevalent} set. We say that a set
is \emph{Haar ambivalent} if it is neither shy nor prevalent.
  The main goal of the paper is to answer the following question: What can we
say about the topological properties of the level sets of the prevalent/non-shy
many $f\in C[0,1]$?
  The classical Bruckner--Garg Theorem characterizes the level sets of the
generic (in the sense of Baire category) $f\in C[0,1]$ from the topological
point of view. We prove that the functions $f\in C[0,1]$ for which the same
characterization holds form a Haar ambivalent set.
  In an earlier paper we proved that the functions $f\in C[0,1]$ for which
positively many level sets with respect to the Lebesgue measure $\lambda$ are
singletons form a non-shy set in $C[0,1]$. The above result yields that this
set is actually Haar ambivalent. Now we prove that the functions $f\in C[0,1]$
for which positively many level sets with respect to the occupation measure
$\lambda\circ f^{-1}$ are not perfect form a Haar ambivalent set in $C[0,1]$.
  We show that for the prevalent $f\in C[0,1]$ for the generic $y\in f([0,1])$
the level set $f^{-1}(y)$ is perfect.
  Finally, we answer a question of Darji and White by showing that the set of
functions $f \in C[0,1]$ for which there exists a perfect $P_f\subset [0,1]$
such that $f'(x) = \infty$ for all $x \in P_f$ is Haar ambivalent.

derivation of his famous $\mathcal{W}$-entropy.
  The defining feature of our entropy is that the energy of each microstate in
the partition function is invariant along the associated geometric flow - a
clue that could be inferred from Perelman's work. Moreover, the monotonicity of
our entropy along the associated geometric flow is then a natural result in the
statistical mechanics framework.
  While we will not argue in a completely rigorous manner, we will use the
formalism to derive an explicit formula for an entropy associated to conformal
flows on a closed surface based on the Polyakov formula for the determinant of
the Laplacian. We also discuss possible extensions of our results to more

decay branching ratio to DM, reheating temperature, and the DM mass and
interaction rate with the thermal bath, the DM particles can either thermalize
(fully/partially) with the primordial bath or remain non-thermal throughout
their evolution history. In the thermal case, the final abundance is set by the
standard freeze-out mechanism for large annihilation rates, irrespective of the
initial conditions. For smaller annihilation rates, it can be set by the
freeze-in mechanism, also independent of the initial abundance, provided it is
small to begin with. For even smaller interaction rates, the DM decouples while
being non-thermal, and the relic abundance will be essentially set by the
initial conditions. We put model-independent constraints on the DM mass and
annihilation rate from over-abundance by exactly solving the relevant Boltzmann
equations, and identify the thermal freeze-out, freeze-in and non-thermal
regions of the allowed parameter space. We highlight a generic fact that
inflaton decay to DM inevitably leads to an overclosure of the Universe for a
large range of DM parameter space, and thus poses a stringent constraint that
must be taken into account while constructing models of DM. For the thermal DM
region, we also show the complementary constraints from indirect DM search
experiments, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, Cosmic Microwave Background, Planck
measurements, and theoretical limits due to the unitarity of S-matrix. For the
non-thermal DM scenario, we show the allowed parameter space in terms of the
inflaton and DM masses for a given reheating temperature, and compute the
comoving free-streaming length to identify the hot, warm and cold DM regimes.

  Architectures","Abstract shortened to respect the arXiv limit of 1920 characters",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the emergence of social networks and improvements in computational
photography, billions of JPEG images are shared and viewed on a daily basis.
Desktops, tablets and smartphones constitute the vast majority of hardware
platforms used for displaying JPEG images. Despite the fact that these
platforms are heterogeneous multicores, no approach exists yet that is capable
of joining forces of a system's CPU and GPU for JPEG decoding. In this paper we
introduce a novel JPEG decoding scheme for heterogeneous architectures
consisting of a CPU and an OpenCL-programmable GPU. We employ an offline
profiling step to determine the performance of a system's CPU and GPU with
respect to JPEG decoding. For a given JPEG image, our performance model uses
(1) the CPU and GPU performance characteristics, (2) the image entropy and (3)
the width and height of the image to balance the JPEG decoding workload on the
underlying hardware. Our run-time partitioning and scheduling scheme exploits
task, data and pipeline parallelism by scheduling the non-parallelizable
entropy decoding task on the CPU, whereas inverse cosine transformations
(IDCTs), color conversions and upsampling are conducted on both the CPU and the
GPU. Our kernels have been optimized for GPU memory hierarchies. We have
implemented the proposed method in the context of the libjpeg-turbo library,
which is an industrial-strength JPEG encoding and decoding engine.
Libjpeg-turbo's hand-optimized SIMD routines for ARM and x86 constitute a
competitive yardstick for the comparison to the proposed approach.
Retro-fitting our method with libjpeg-turbo provided insights on the
software-engineering aspects of re-engineering legacy code for heterogeneous
multicores.

analysis on a big sample with 202 ZP events collected from observations at the

Radiospectrograph in Czech Republic at frequencies of 1.00 - 7.60 GHz during

occurrence in flare phase, frequency range, polarization degree, duration,
etc., we find that the variation of zebra stripe frequency separation with
respect to frequency is the best indicator for a physical classification of
ZPs. Microwave ZPs can be classified into 3 types: equidistant ZP,
variable-distant ZP, and growing-distant ZP, possibly corresponding to
mechanisms of Bernstein wave model, whistler wave model, and double plasma

clarify the controversies between the existing various theoretical models, and

fundamental importance to the measurement of commonly used indicators of galaxy
evolution, including the Tully-Fisher relation and the HI mass function. Here,
we propose a new analytic function, named the 'busy function', that can be used
to accurately describe the characteristic double-horn HI profile of many
galaxies. The busy function is a continuous, differentiable function that
consists of only two basic functions, the error function, erf(x), and a
polynomial, |x|^n, of degree n >= 2. We present the basic properties of the
busy function and illustrate its great flexibility in fitting a wide range of
HI profiles from the Gaussian profiles of dwarf galaxies to the broad,
asymmetric double-horn profiles of spiral galaxies.
  Applications of the busy function include the accurate and efficient
parametrization of observed HI spectra of galaxies and the construction of
spectral templates for simulations and matched filtering algorithms. We
demonstrate the busy function's power by automatically fitting it to the HI
spectra of 1000 galaxies from the HIPASS Bright Galaxy Catalog, using our own
C/C++ implementation, and comparing the resulting parameters with the
catalogued ones. We also present two methods for determining the uncertainties
of observational parameters derived from the fit.

for solution of transport equations, which has been most often applied to the
kinetic description of plasmas and rarefied neutral gases. In its simplest
form, the CS propagates the solution by advecting the `moving cells' along
their characteristic trajectories, and by remapping them on the mesh at the end
of the time step. The CS is conservative, positivity preserving, simple to
implement, and not subject to time step restriction to maintain stability.
Recently [Y. G\""u\c{c}l\""u and W.N.G. Hitchon, 2012] a new methodology was
introduced for reducing numerical diffusion, based on a modified equation
analysis: the remapping error was compensated by applying small corrections to
the final position of the moving cells prior to remapping. While the spatial
accuracy was increased from 2nd to 4th order, the new scheme retained the
important properties of the original method, and was shown to be simple and
efficient for constant advection problems. Here the CS is applied to the
solution of the Vlasov-Poisson system: the Vlasov equation is split into two
constant advection equations, one in configuration space and one in velocity
space, and high order time accuracy is achieved by proper composition of the
operators. The splitting procedure enables us to use the constant advection
solver, which we extend to arbitrarily high order of accuracy: a new improved
procedure is given, which makes the calculation of the corrections
straightforward. Focusing on periodic domains, we describe a spectrally
accurate scheme based on the fast Fourier transform; the proposed
implementation is strictly conservative and positivity preserving. The ability
to correctly reproduce the system dynamics, as well as resolving small-scale
features in the solution, is shown in classical 1D-1V test cases, both in the
linear and the non-linear regimes.

neurologically healthy controls (N=30), we mapped white matter pathways from
the cortex into the striatum using a deterministic tractography algorithm that
estimates fiber bundles as dimensionless streamlines. Level set trees were used
for interactive exploration of patterns in the endpoint distributions of the
mapped fiber tracks and an efficient segmentation of the tracks that has
empirical accuracy comparable to standard nonparametric clustering methods. We
show that level set trees can also be generalized to model pseudo-density
functions in order to analyze a broader array of data types, including entire
fiber streamlines. Finally, resampling methods show the reliability of the
level set tree as a descriptive measure of topographic structure, illustrating
its potential as a statistical descriptor in brain imaging analysis. These

are as follows:
  (I) A decomposition of each undirected graph with vertex-connectivity $k$
into (fractionally) vertex-disjoint weighted dominating trees with total weight
$\Omega(\frac{k}{\log n})$, in $\widetilde{O}(D+\sqrt{n})$ rounds.

to near-optimal $\tilde{O}(m)$.
  As corollaries, we also get distributed oblivious routing broadcast with
$O(1)$-competitive edge-congestion and $O(\log n)$-competitive

near-time-optimal $O(\log n)$-approximation of vertex connectivity: centralized
$\widetilde{O}(m)$ and distributed $\tilde{O}(D+\sqrt{n})$. The former moves
toward the 1974 conjecture of Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman postulating an $O(m)$
centralized exact algorithm while the latter is the first distributed vertex

has experienced substantial collisional and dynamical evolution in the

May, and derived synodic rotational periods for 51 objects, including newly

of fast and slow rotators in observed rotation rate distribution. The
two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test confirms that the spin rate distribution is
not consistent with a Maxwellian at a 92% confidence level. From correlations
among rotational periods, amplitudes of lightcurves, and sizes, we conclude
that the rotational properties of Maria family asteroids have been changed
considerably by non-gravitational forces such as the YORP effect. Using a
lightcurve inversion method (Kaasalainen & Torppa 2001; Kaasalainen et al.
2001), we successfully determined the pole orientations for 13 Maria members,
and found an excess of prograde versus retrograde spins with a ratio (N_p/N_r)
of 3. This implies that the retrograde rotators could have been ejected by the
3:1 resonance into the inner Solar System since the formation of Maria family.
We estimate that approximately 37 to 75 Maria family asteroids larger than 1 km
have entered the near-Earth space every 100 Myr.

A linear stability analysis is performed to find the slow-roll conditions,

tachyon warm inflationary models are redefined. Two cases, an exponential

crucial condition is obtained for a tachyon warm inflationary model

condition is extendable to some other inflationary models as well. A proper
number of e-folds is obtained in both cases of the tachyon warm inflation, in

Costa Filho et al., the translation operator is modified to include an inverse
character length scale, $\gamma$, which defines the SPDEM. The introduction of
$\gamma$ means translations are no longer additive. In nonadditive space, we
choose a `skewed' Gaussian confinement potential defined by the replacement
$x\rightarrow\gamma^{-1}\ln(1+\gamma x)$ in the usual Gaussian potential.
Within the parabolic approximation $\gamma$ is inversely related to the QW
thickness and we obtain analytic solutions to our confinement Hamiltonian. Our
calculation yields a reduced dispersion relation for the gap energy ($E_G$) as
a function of QW thickness, $D$: $E_G\sim D^{-1}$, compared to the effective
mass approximation: $E_G\sim D^{-2}$. Additionally, nonadditive space contracts
the position space metric thus increasing the occupied momentum space and
reducing the effective mass, in agreement the relation: $m_o^{*-1}\propto
\frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial \v{k}^2}$. The change in the effective mass is
shown to be a function of the confinement potential via a point canonical
transformation. Our calculation agrees with experimental measurements of $E_G$

Compton scattering by a relativistically moving cold plasma to constrain wind
properties by imposing that radio pulses from the pulsar itself are not
scattered by the wind as was first studied by Wilson & Rees. We find that
relativistic effects cause a significant increase or decrease of the scattering
coefficient depending on scattering geometry. Applying to the Crab, we consider
uncertainties of an inclination angle of the wind velocity with respect to the
radio beam $\theta_{\rm pl}$ and the emission region size $r_{\rm e}$ which
determines an opening angle of the radio beam. We obtain the lower limit
$\gamma\gtrsim10^{1.7}r^{1/2}_{\rm e,3}\theta^{-1}_{\rm pl}(1+\sigma)^{-1/4}$

$10^{1.7}\lesssim\gamma\lesssim10^{3.9}$ and

coefficients to the branching ratio $B_s \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ in the Standard Model
(SM) and to $\bar{B}\to X_s \gamma$ in the Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) are
discussed. In both cases a three-loop matching between the full and effective
theory was performed, which leads to a significant reduction of the scale
uncertainty.

transfer. We give a formal probabilistic representation of its solution in the
framework of biological tissues and we implement algorithms based on Monte
Carlo methods in order to estimate the quantity of light that is received by an
homogeneous tissue when emitted by an optic fiber. A variance reduction method
is studied and implemented, as well as a Markov chain Monte Carlo method based
on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The resulting estimating methods are then
compared to the so-called Wang-Prahl (or Wang) method. Finally, the formal
representation allows to derive a non-linear optimization algorithm close to
Levenberg-Marquardt that is used for the estimation of the scattering and
absorption coefficients of the tissue from measurements.

objective definition of phase information in a purely classical computational
universe with quantized phase states, this quantization being imposed by our
fundamental hypothesis that physical information has a finite and limited
density, responsible for the irreversibility. We use a statistical study of
results obtained by numerical simulations of a billiard to highlight an
excessive and paradoxical loss of phase information that we solve by involving
a classical to quantum transition. After discussing the pertinence of such a
transition to clarify some problematic aspects of statistical physics, we
conclude that a computational universe should automatically lose phase
information through time in an irreversible way, which could be compensated by
a gain of physical information due to observation and decoherence.

a high temperature superconductor and show that both the nature and degree of
the inhomogeneities at zero temperature in the local order parameters change
drastically from what are obtained in a simple Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory.
While both the strong electronic repulsions and disorder contribute to the
nanoscale inhomogeneity in the population of charge-carriers, we find them to
compete with each other leading to a relatively smooth variation of the local
density. Our self-consistent calculations modify the spatial fluctuations in
the pairing amplitude by suppressing all the double-occupancy within a
Gutzwiller formalism and prohibit the formation of distinct
superconducting-`islands'. In contrast, presence of such `islands' controls the
outcome if strong correlations are neglected. The reorganization of the spatial
structures in the Gutzwiller method makes these superconductors surprisingly
insensitive to the impurities. This is illustrated by a very weak decay of
superfluid stiffness, off-diagonal long range order and local density of states
up to a large disorder strength. Exploring the origin of such a robustness we
conclude that the underlying one-particle normal states reshape in a rich
manner, such that the superconductor formed by pairing these states experiences
a weaker but spatially correlated effective disorder. Such a route to
superconductivity is evocative of Anderson's theorem. Our results capture the
key experimental trends in the cuprates.

formation. High-resolution IR spectra of CO ro-vibrational emission at eight
different position angles were taken with CRIRES at the VLT. From these spectra
flux tables, CO ro-vibrational line profiles, and population diagrams were
produced. We have investigated variations in the line profile shapes and line
strengths as a function of slit position angle. We used the thermochemical disc
modelling code ProDiMo based on the chemistry, radiation field, and temperature
structure of a previously published model for HD100546. Comparing observations
and the model, we investigated the possibility of disc asymmetries, the
excitation mechanism (UV fluorescence), the geometry, and physical conditions
of the inner disc. The observed CO ro-vibrational lines are largely emitted
from the inner rim of the outer disc at 10-13 AU. The line shapes are similar
for all v levels and line fluxes from all vibrational levels vary only within
one order of magnitude. All line profile asymmetries and variations can be
explained with a symmetric disc model to which a slit correction and pointing
offset is applied. Because the angular size of the CO emitting region (10-13
AU) and the slit width are comparable the line profiles are very sensitive to
the placing of the slit. The model reproduces the line shapes and the fluxes of
the v=1-0 lines as well as the spatial extent of the CO ro-vibrational
emission. It does not reproduce the observed band ratios of 0.5-0.2 with higher
vibrational bands. We find that lower gas volume densities at the surface of
the inner rim of the outer disc can make the fluorescence pumping more effcient
and reproduce the observed band ratios.

symmetric distribution has a specified centre and the Gaussianity is in
question. As with all insurance policies it comes with a cost, even if small,
in terms of power versus a t-test, when the distribution is indeed Gaussian. In
this note we further show that even when the distribution tested is Gaussian
there need not be power loss at all, if the alternative is of a mixture type
rather than a shift. The signed rank test may turn out to be more powerful than
the t-test, and the supposedly conservative strategy, might actually be the
more powerful one. Drug testing and functional magnetic imaging are two such
scenarios.
  Wilcoxon' signed rank test will typically be called upon by a researcher when
testing for the location of a single population, using a small sample and
Gaussianity is dubious. As all insurance policies, it will come with a cost--
power. It is well known, that under a Gaussian setup, the signed rank test is
less powerful than, say, a t-test. The works of Pitman and others have
reassured us that this power loss is surprisingly small. In this note we argue
that the power loss might actually be smaller than typically assumed. In
particular, if the deviation from the null Gaussian distribution is of a
mixture type and not a shift type, the signed rank test is no longer dominated
by the t-test and can actually be more powerful.

Poisson point process distribution and where Voronoi cells define the planar
areas associated with them. For the service of each user, either one or two
base stations are involved. If two, these cooperate by exchange of user data
and reduced channel information (channel phase, second neighbour interference)
with conferencing over some backhaul link. The total user transmission power is
split between them and a common message is encoded, which is coherently
transmitted by the stations. The decision for a user to choose service with or
without cooperation is directed by a family of geometric policies. The
suggested policies further control the shape of coverage contours in favor of
cell-edge areas. Analytic expressions based on stochastic geometry are derived
for the coverage probability in the network. Their numerical evaluation shows
benefits from cooperation, which are enhanced when Dirty Paper Coding is
applied to eliminate the second neighbour interference.

successfully prepared 1-UC FeSe films on insulating STO substrates with

quantum network (\textsc{qnet}) it can not be retrieved back, even if the
dealer wishes that her secret no longer be available in the network. For
instance, if the dealer is part of two \textsc{qnet}s, say $\mathcal{Q}_1$ and
$\mathcal{Q}_2$ and subsequently finds that $\mathcal{Q}_2$ is more reliable
than $\mathcal{Q}_1$, the dealer may wish to transfer all her secrets from

designing a protocol that enables the source/dealer to bring back the
information shared in the network, if desired. Unlike classical revocation,
no-cloning-theorem automatically ensures that the secret is no longer shared in
the network.
  The implications of our results are multi-fold. One interesting implication
of our technique is the possibility of routing qubits in asynchronous
\textsc{qnets}. By asynchrony we mean that the requisite data/resources are
intermittently available (but not necessarily simultaneously) in the
\textsc{qnet}. For example, we show that a source $S$ can send quantum
information to a destination $R$ even though (a) $S$ and $R$ share no quantum
resource, (b) $R$'s identity is {\em unknown}\/ to $S$ initially, (c) $S$
herself can be $R$ at a later date and/or in a different location to bequeath
her information and (d) the path chosen for routing the secret may hit a
dead-end due to resource constraints. Another implication of our technique is
the possibility of using {\em insecure}\/ resources. For instance, it may
safely store its private information with a neighboring organization without
revealing data to the host and losing control over retrieving the data.
  Putting the two implications together, namely routing and secure storage, it
is possible to envision applications like quantum mail (qmail) as an outsourced
service.

Ms increases to ~75% of the bulk magnetization. The improved structure also

unusual increase in the resonant field Hr(T) and also as a maximum of the

exactly two critical points, let $\omega\in\mathbb{T}$ be Diophantine, and let
$\lambda>0$ be sufficiently large (depending on $f$ and $\omega$). For any
value of the parameter $E\in \mathbb{R}$ we make a careful analysis of the
dynamics of the skew-product map $$\Phi_E(\theta,r)=\left(\theta+\omega,\lambda
f(\theta)-E-1/r\right),$$ acting on the ""torus""
$\mathbb{T}\times\widehat{\mathbb{R}}$. The map $\Phi_E$ is intimately related
to the quasi-periodic Schr\""odinger cocycle $(\omega,A_E): \mathbb{T}\times
\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{T}\times \mathbb{R}^2$, $(\theta,x)\mapsto
(\theta+\omega, A_E(\theta)\cdot x)$, where $A_E:\mathbb{T}\to
\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ is given by $A_{E}(\theta)=\left(\begin{matrix}0 & 1
\\ -1 & \lambda f(\theta)-E \end{matrix} \right), \quad E\in \mathbb{R}. $ More
precisely, $(\omega,A_E)$ naturally acts on the space
$\mathbb{T}\times\widehat{\mathbb{R}}$, and $\Phi_E$ is the map thus obtained.
The analysis of $\Phi_E$ allows us to derive three main results: (1) The
(maximal) Lyapunov exponent of the Schr\""odinger cocycle $(\omega,A_E)$ is
$\gtrsim \log \lambda$, uniformly in $E\in \mathbb{R}$. This implies that the
map $\Phi_E$ has exactly two ergodic probability measures for all $E\in
\mathbb{R}$; (2) If $E$ is on the edge of an open gap in the spectrum
$\sigma(H)$ of the associated Schr\""odinger operator $H_\theta$, then there
exist a phase $\theta\in\mathbb{T}$ and a vector $u\in l^2(\mathbb{Z})$,
exponentially decaying at $\pm\infty$, such that $H_\theta u=Eu$; (3) The map
$\Phi_E$ is minimal iff $E\in \sigma(H)\setminus\{\text{edges of open gaps}\}$.
In particular, $\Phi_E$ is minimal for all $E$ for which the fibered rotation
number $\alpha(E)$ associated to $(\omega,A_E)$ is irrational with respect to
$\omega$.

one of the LCFT operators we consider, allowing us to calculate crossing
probabilities and expectation values of crossing cluster numbers. We review the
Coulomb gas, which we use as a method of calculating these quantities when the
number of bcc operator makes a direct solution to the system of differential
equations intractable.
  Finally we discuss the case of the six-point correlation function, which
applies to crossing probabilities between the sides of a conformal hexagon.
Specifically we introduce an integral result that allows one to identify the
probability that a single percolation cluster touches three alternating sides a
hexagon with free boundaries. We give results of the numerical integration for

accurate expression, the Maier- Saupe free energy for nematic order. Instead of
the traditional approach of expanding the free energy with a truncated Taylor
series, we employ a least-squares fitting to obtain the coefficients of a
polynomial expression. Both methods are compared, and the fitting with at most
five polynomial terms is shown to provide a satisfactory fitting, and to give
much more accurate results than the traditional Taylor expansion. We perform
the analysis in terms of the tensor order parameter, so the results are valid
in uniaxial and biaxial states.

Digital Signal Processing (DSP) using Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The use
of SVMs in estimation problems has been traditionally limited to its mere use
as a black-box model. Noting such limitations in the literature, we take
advantage of several properties of Mercer's kernels and functional analysis to
develop a family of SVM methods for estimation in DSP. Three types of signal
model equations are analyzed. First, when a specific time-signal structure is
assumed to model the underlying system that generated the data, the linear
signal model (so called Primal Signal Model formulation) is first stated and
analyzed. Then, non-linear versions of the signal structure can be readily
developed by following two different approaches. On the one hand, the signal
model equation is written in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) using the
well-known RKHS Signal Model formulation, and Mercer's kernels are readily used
in SVM non-linear algorithms. On the other hand, in the alternative and not so
common Dual Signal Model formulation, a signal expansion is made by using an
auxiliary signal model equation given by a non-linear regression of each time
instant in the observed time series. These building blocks can be used to
generate different novel SVM-based methods for problems of signal estimation,
and we deal with several of the most important ones in DSP. We illustrate the
usefulness of this methodology by defining SVM algorithms for linear and
non-linear system identification, spectral analysis, nonuniform interpolation,
sparse deconvolution, and array processing. The performance of the developed
SVM methods is compared to standard approaches in all these settings. The
experimental results illustrate the generality, simplicity, and capabilities of
the proposed SVM framework for DSP.

ground state but spontaneously broken in the vicinity of their cores. In this
case, there appear (non-Abelian) Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes confined and
propagating along the vortex. In relativistic theories, the
Coleman-Mermin-Wagner theorem forbids the existence of a spontaneous symmetry
breaking, or a long-range order, in 1+1 dimensions: quantum corrections restore
the symmetry along the vortex and the NG modes acquire a mass gap. We show that
in non-relativistic theories NG modes with quadratic dispersion relation
confined on a vortex can remain gapless at quantum level. We provide a concrete
and experimentally realizable example of a three-component Bose-Einstein
condensate with U(1) x U(2) symmetry. We first show, at the classical level,
the existence of S^3 = S^1 |x S^2 (S^1 fibered over S^2) NG modes associated to
the breaking U(2) -> U(1) on vortices, where S^1 and S^2 correspond to type I
and II NG modes, respectively. We then show, by using a Bethe ansatz technique,
that the U(1) symmetry is restored, while the SU(2) symmery remains broken
non-pertubatively at quantum level. Accordingly, the U(1) NG mode turns into a
c=1 conformal field theory, the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid, while the S^2 NG
mode remains gapless, describing a ferromagnetic liquid. This allows the vortex
to be genuinely non-Abelian at quantum level.

interfacial polarization charges associated with the low permittivity membrane.
We validate the quantitative accuracy of the theory by comparisons with
previously obtained Monte-Carlo simulation data from the literature, and
scrutinize in detail the underlying forces driving the ionic selectivity of the
nanopore. In the biologically relevant case of electrolytes with divalent
cations such as CaCl2 in negatively charged nanopores, electrostatic
correlations associated with the dense counterion layer in the channel result
in an increase of the pore coion density with the surface charge. This
peculiarity analogous to the charge inversion phenomenon remains intact for
dielectrically inhomogeneous pores, which indicates that the effect should be
observable in nanofiltration membranes or DNA-blocked nanopores characterized
by a low membrane permittivity. Our results show that a quantitatively accurate
consideration of correlation effects is necessary to determine the ionic
selectivity of nanopores in the presence of electrolytes with multivalent
counterions.

block copolymers in a reactive solvent and fixation of the morphologies by the
cross-linking reaction. Nanostructuration requires the presence of a bock that
remains miscible in the polymer during polymerization. The selection of the
miscible block depends on the particular system and in some cases (e.g., for
epoxy-amine network based on diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A, and 4,4'-
diaminodiphenylsulfone) it is very difficult to find such a block. In this
manuscript it is shown that random copolymers of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and
N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMA) containing different molar fractions of DMA, can
be used as a miscible block for the nanostructuration of epoxies. The
miscibility of the random copolymer during formation of the epoxy network was
first analyzed determining cloud-point conversions as a function of the molar
fraction of DMA in the copolymer. A thermodynamic model of the phase separation
was performed using the Flory-Huggins model and taking the polydispersities of
both polymers into account. A single expression of the interaction parameter
based on the theory of random copolymers provided a reasonable fitting of the
experimental cloud-point curves. The significant increase in the miscibility
produced by using small DMA molar fractions in the copolymer was explained by
the high negative value of the binary interaction energy between DMA and the
epoxy-amine solvent, associated to the positive value of the interaction energy
between DMA and MMA units. Block copolymers with poly(n-butyl acrylate) as the
immiscible block and the random copolymer P(MMA-co-DMA) as the miscible block
were used for the nanostructuration of epoxy networks. The necessary molar
fraction of DMA in the miscible block to stabilize a dispersion of nanosize
domains depended on the fraction of the immiscible block.

uniform alignment in the outer boundaries. Defect and textures are analyzed as
functions of temperature T, polygon size R, and polygon number N. For nematic
nanocomposites, the texture satisfies a defect charge balance equation between
bulk and surface (particle corner) charges. Upon decreasing the temperature,
the central bulk defects split and together with other -1/2 bulk defects, are
absorbed by the nanoparticle's corners. Increasing the lattice size decreases
confinement and eliminates bulk defects. Increasing the polygon number
increases the central defect charge at high temperature and the number of
surface defects at lower temperatures. The excess energy per particle is lower
in even than in odd polygons, and it is minimized for a square particle
arrangement. These discrete modeling results show for first time that even
under strong anchoring, defects are attached to particles as corner defects,
leaving behind a low energy homogeneous orientation field that favors
nanoparticle ordering in nematic matrices. These new insights are consistent
with recent thermodynamic approaches to nematic nanocomposites that predict the
existence of novel nematic/crystal phases and can be used to design
nanocomposites with orientational and positional order.

of the organic coronas and the dispersion of particles with swollen coronas in
the solvent. The energetic interaction between alkyl chains and solvent is
considered, both within the corona and between the outer alkyl segments and
free solvent. Swelling involves mixing of alkanethiol chains and solvent in the
corona and stretching of the organic chains. Dispersion considers an entropic
contribution based on Carnahan Starling equation of state and an enthalpic term
calculated considering the surface contacts between alkyl segments placed in
the external boundary of the corona and the molecules of free solvent. Two
different kinds of phase equilibrium are found. One of them, observed at high
values of the interaction parameter, is the typical liquid-liquid equilibrium
for compact NPs in a poor solvent where a complete phase separation is observed
when cooling (increasing the interaction parameter). The second liquid-liquid
equilibrium is observed at low values of the interaction parameter, where
swelling of coronas is favored. In this region two different phases co-exist,
one more concentrated in NPs that exhibit relatively compact coronas and the
other one more diluted in NPs with extended coronas. In diluted solutions of
NPs the deswelling of the fully extended coronas takes place abruptly in a very
small temperature range, leading to a solution of compact NPs. This critical
transition might find practical applications similar to those found for the
abrupt shrinkage of hydrogels at a critical temperature.

solution of polyisobutylene (PIB) in isobornyl methacrylate (IBoMA). Ternary
phase diagrams of PIB, IBoMA and poly(isobornyl methacrylate) (PIBoMA) were
built at 80C. They were shifted to lower conversions when increasing the molar
mass of PIB. Different PIBs exhibiting CPC at advanced conversions were
selected for the kinetic study performed employing differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) at 80C. A simple kinetic model for free-radical
polymerizations describing the relevant termination rate constant in terms of
the free-volume theory, provided a consistent fitting of the polymerization
rates in the conversion range where the solution remained homogeneous.
Increasing the molar mass of PIB led to an increase in polymerization rate due
to the decrease in free volume and the corresponding decrease of the
termination rate. Increasing the amount of a particular PIB in the initial
formulation led to a less marked gel effect, explained by the smaller relative
variation of free volume with conversion. The dimensionless free volume of PIB
obtained from the kinetic model was found to increase with the volume
concentration of chain ends, as expected. Under conditions where phase
separation took place at very low conversions, the overall polymerization rate
exhibited the presence of two maxima (gel effects), representing the
polymerization in two different phases. The first maximum was associated to the
polymerization taking place in the phase lean in PIB and the second maximum was
associated to the polymerization of the monomer that was initially fractionated
with PIB.

deterministic framework by considering the influence spatio-temporal noise. The
outstanding problem that we here address is the development of a theory that
gives rigorous meaning to stochastic neural field equations, and conditions
ensuring that they are well-posed. Previous investigations in the field of
computational and mathematical neuroscience have been numerical for the most
part. Such questions have been considered for a long time in the theory of
stochastic partial differential equations, where at least two different
approaches have been developed, each having its advantages and disadvantages.
It turns out that both approaches have also been used in computational and
mathematical neuroscience, but with much less emphasis on the underlying
theory. We present a review of two existing theories and show how they can be
used to put the theory of stochastic neural fields on a rigorous footing. We
also provide general conditions on the parameters of the stochastic neural
field equations under which we guarantee that these equations are well-posed.
In so doing we relate each approach to previous work in computational and
mathematical neuroscience. We hope this will provide a reference that will pave
the way for future studies (both theoretical and applied) of these equations,
where basic questions of existence and uniqueness will no longer be a cause for
concern.

(IBoMA) at 80C, initiated by benzoyl peroxide (BPO), was determined by
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), using sample pans previously sealed in
air or in nitrogen. The polymerization was arrested by vitrification at a final
conversion close to 0.80. The kinetics in nitrogen could be fitted using
initiation and propagation rate constants reported in the literature, a
functionality of the termination rate constant controlled by translational
diffusion based on the free-volume model, and an efficiency factor for the
initiator decomposition that decreased with conversion in the medium-high
conversion range. The presence of oxygen led to a significant decrease in the
polymerization rate, an effect that was enhanced when decreasing the sample
size (increasing the surface-to-volume ratio). The original finding was the
presence of two maxima in the isothermal polymerization rate (a double gel
effect), a fact that was confirmed by replicating experiences in two different
DSC devices and changing the amount of initiator in the formulation. The first
maximum in the polymerization rate was explained by the decrease of the
diffusion rate of macromolecular radicals to the oxygen-rich boundary, an
effect that starts at low conversions. The second maximum was related to the
decrease in the solubility/diffusion of oxygen in the reaction medium, a
phenomenon that is particularly severe at high conversions.

series of oligodiols based on a bisphenol A nucleus and short branches of
poly(ethylene oxide) or poly(propylene oxide) (BPA-EO or BPA-PO), and with PEO
and PPO oligomers, were obtained using a light transmission device.
Experimental results were fitted with the Flory- Huggins model using an
interaction parameter depending on both temperature and composition. For
PMMA/PEO and PMMA/PPO blends, the miscibility increased when increasing the
size of the diol, due to the significant decrease in the entropic and enthalpic
terms contributing to the interaction parameter. This reflected the decrease in
the selfassociation of solvent molecules and in the contribution of terminal OH
groups to the mismatching of solubility parameters. For PMMA/BPA-EO blends, a
decrease of the entropic contribution to the interaction parameter when
increasing the size of the oligodiol was also found. However, the effect was
counterbalanced by the opposite contribution of combinatorial terms leading to
cloud-point curves located in approximately the same temperature range. For
PMMA/BPA-PO blends, the interaction parameter exhibited a very low value. In
this case, the effect of solvent size was much more important on combinatorial
terms than on the interaction parameter, leading to an increase in miscibility
when decreasing the oligodiol size. For short BPA-PO oligodiols no phase
separation was observed. The entropic contribution of the interaction parameter
exhibited an inverse relationship with the size of the oligodiols, independent
of the nature of the chains bearing the hydroxyls and the type of OH groups
(primary or secondary). This indicates that the degree of self-association of
solvent molecules through their OH terminal groups, was mainly determined by
their relative sizes.

realized which may be attributed to the phase segregated nature of samples.
This phase segregation is avoided using floating zone growth. However, the
grown sample was found to have undergone phase transformation via spinodal
decomposition at low temperatures. In the present work, thermal annealing has
been done on the spinodally decomposed samples and its effect on
microstructure, crystallographic structure and magnetic properties has been
studied. Annealing experiments were done and analyzed in order to understand
the extent of the solid state miscibility gap. With regards to the phase
diagram, the two-phase regime was found to extend till 1000 {\deg}C. Even at
1250 {\deg}C, we are still inside the immiscibility region. The thermodynamic
miscibility gap was thus found to exist until high temperatures and alternate
routes might be required to obtain a single phase sample with the desired high
spin polarization and Curie temperature in the Co-Cr-Al system.

transport in fluid dynamics and other non-autonomous dynamical systems.
Recently, the notion of coherence has come to a more rigorous footing, and
particularly within the recent advances of finite-time studies of
non-autonomous dynamical systems. Here we define shape coherent sets as a means
to emphasize the intuitive notion of ensembles which ""hold together"" for some
period of time, and we contrast this notion to other recent perspectives of
coherence, notably ""coherent pairs"", and likewise also to the geodesic theory
of material lines. We will relate shape coherence to the differential geometry
concept of curve congruence through matching curvatures. We show that points in
phase space where there is a zero-splitting between stable and unstable
manifolds locally correspond to points where curvature will evolve only slowly
in time. Then we develop curves of points with zero-angle, meaning
non-hyperbolic splitting, by continuation methods in terms of the implicit
function theorem. From this follows a simple ODE description of the boundaries
of shape coherent sets. We will illustrate our methods with popular benchmark
examples, and further investigate the intricate structure of foliations

The bipolar lobes are likely produced by the winds from the activities within
Sgr A West, which could be collimated by the inertia of gas in the CND, or by
the momentum driving of Sgr A*; and the poloidal magnetic fields likely play an
important role in the collimation. The less-collimated SE lobe, in comparison
to the NW one, is perhaps due to the fact that the Sgr A East SN might have
locally reconfigured the magnetic field toward negative galactic latitudes. In
agreement with the X-ray observations, the time-scale of ~ $1\times10^4$ yr

transitions, by considering the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (FSE), as a typical
example of a financial market of a medium size. Using the canonical object for
the graph theory, i.e. the Minimal Spanning Tree (MST) network, we observe: (i)
The initial phase transition from the equilibrium to non-equilibrium MST
network in its nucleation phase, occurring at some critical time. Coalescence
of edges on the FSE's transient leader is observed within the nucleation and is
approximately characterized by the Lifsthiz-Slyozov growth exponent; (ii) The
nucleation accelerates and transforms to the condensation process, in the
second phase transition, forming a logarithmically diverging lambda-peak of
short-range order parameters at the subsequent critical time - an analogon of
such a transition in superfluidity; (iii) In the third phase transition, the
peak logarithmically decreases over three quarters of the year, resulting in a
few loosely connected sub-graphs. This peak is reminiscent of a non-equilibrium
superstar-like superhub or a `dragon king' effect, abruptly accelerating the
evolution of the leader company. All these phase transitions are caused by the
few richest vertices, which drift towards the leader and provide the most of
the edges increasing the leader's degree. Thus, we capture an amazing
phenomenon, likely of a more universal character, where a peripheral vertex
becomes the one which is over dominating the complex network during an
exceptionally long period of time.

time-dependent parabolic potential and scattering length, as well as Rabi
coupling of the separate hyperfine states. By means of a similarity
transformation, we transform the non-autonomous coupled Gross-Pitaevskii
equations into the completely integrable Manakov model with defocusing
nonlinearity, and construct the explicit form of the non-autonomous soliton
solutions. The propagation characteristics for the one-soliton state, and
collision scenarios for multiple soliton states are discussed in detail for two
types of time-dependent nonlinearities: a kink-like one and a periodically
modulated one, with appropriate time-dependence of the trapping potential. We
find that in the two-component condensates the nature of soliton propagation is
determined predominantly by the nature of the nonlinearity, as well as the
temporal modulation of the harmonic potential; switching in this setting is
essentially due to Rabi coupling. We also perform direct numerical simulation
of the non-autonomous two-component coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations to
corroborate our analytical predictions. More interestingly, in the case of the
three-component condensates, we find that the solitons can lead to
collision-induced energy switching (energy-sharing collision), that can be
profitably used to control Rabi switching or vice-versa. An interesting
possibility of reversal of the nature of the constituent soliton, i.e., bright

that in the broad range of values of the fraction of faulty nodes the networks
under consideration possess high fault tolerance, the deterministic networks
being slightly better than the stochastic ones.

metallic screen on an existing sheet metal roof. The system enhances passive
cooling of dwellings and can help diminishing power costs for air conditioning
in summer or in tropical and arid countries. In this work, radiation,
convection and conduction heat transfers are investigated. Depending on its
surface properties, the screen reflects a large amount of oncoming solar
radiation. Natural convection in the channel underneath drives off the residual
heat. The bi-dimensional numerical simulation of the heat transfers through the
double skin reveals the most important parameters for the system's efficiency.
They are, by order of importance, the sheet metal surface emissivity, the
screen internal and external surface emissivity, the insulation thickness and
the inclination angle for a channel width over 6 cm. The influence of those
parameters on Rayleigh and Nusselt numbers is also investigated. Temperature
and air velocity profiles on several channel cross-sections are plotted and
discussed.

very soft, thus increasing force resolution. In this letter, we explore
theoretical aspects of the associated real time control of the tip position. We
take into account lever parameters such as the lever characteristics in its
environment, spring constant, mass, dissipation coefficient and the operating
conditions such as controller gains, and interaction force. We show how the
controller parameters are determined so that the FFM functions at its best and

challenges from adversaries that can only be resolved by way of ever more
sophisticated inputs into tactical operations. Lethal Autonomy provides
constrained military/security forces with a viable option, but only if
implementation has got proper empirically supported foundations. Autonomous
weapon systems can be designed and developed to conduct ground, air and naval
operations. This monograph offers some insights into the challenges of
developing legal, reliable and ethical forms of autonomous weapons, that
address the gap between Police or Law Enforcement and Military operations that
is growing exponentially small. National adversaries are today in many
instances hybrid threats, that manifest criminal and military traits, these
often require deployment of hybrid-capability autonomous weapons imbued with
the capability to taken on both Military and/or Security objectives. The
Westgate Terrorist Attack of 21st September 2013 in the Westlands suburb of
Nairobi, Kenya is a very clear manifestation of the hybrid combat scenario that
required military response and police investigations against a fighting cell of
the Somalia based globally networked Al Shabaab terrorist group.

  accumulated alpha-synuclein",,,,,"q-bio.OT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Parkinson disease is a very common neurodegenerative disorder. Patients
usually undergo destruction of substantia nigra to develop typical symptoms
such as resting tremor, hypokinesia, and rigidity. However, the exact mechanism
of Parkinson disease is still unknown, so it is called idiopathic Parkinsonism.
According to my microarray analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes and
substantia nigra brain tissue, I propose that Parkinson disease is actually a
TH17 dominant autoimmune disease. Based on the microarray data in substantia
nigra, HSP40, HSP70, HSP90, HSP27, HSP105, TLR5, TLR7, CEBPB, CEBPG, FOS, and
caspase1 are significantly up-regulated. In peripheral leukocytes, NFKB1A,
CEBPD, FOS, retinoic receptor alpha, suppressor of IKK epsilon, S100A11, G-CSF,
MMP9, IL-1 receptor, IL-8 receptor, TNF receptor, caspase8, c1q receptor,
cathepsin Z, HLA-G, complement receptor1, and complement 5a receptor. General
immune related genes are also up-regulated including ILF2, CD22, CD3E, BLNK,
ILF3, TCR alpha, TCR zeta, TCR delta, LAT, ITK, Ly9, and BANK1. The autoantigen
is mainly alpha-synuclein. After knowing the exact disease pathophysiology, we
can develop better drugs to prevent or control the detrimental disorder.

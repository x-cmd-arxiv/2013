  Predicate Logic Form","14 pages, 11 figures",,,,"cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dependently typed lambda calculi such as the Edinburgh Logical Framework (LF)
are a popular means for encoding rule-based specifications concerning formal
syntactic objects. In these frameworks, relations over terms representing
formal objects are naturally captured by making use of the dependent structure
of types. We consider here the meaning-preserving translation of specifications
written in this style into a predicate logic over simply typed {\lambda}-terms.
Such a translation can provide the basis for efficient implementation and
sophisticated capabilities for reasoning about specifications. We start with a
previously described translation of LF specifications to formulas in the logic
of higher-order hereditary Harrop (hohh) formulas. We show how this translation
can be improved by recognizing and eliminating redundant type checking
information contained in it. This benefits both the clarity of translated
formulas, and reduces the effort which must be spent on type checking during
execution. To allow this translation to be used to execute LF specifications,
we describe an inverse transformation from hohh terms to LF expressions; thus
computations can be carried out using the translated form and the results can
then be exported back into LF. Execution based on LF specifications may also
involve some forms of type reconstruction. We discuss the possibility of
supporting such a capability using the translation under some reasonable
restrictions on the structure of specifications.

range of inner solar system materials, including terrestrial basalts,
chondrites, and achondrites. A possible exception is the angrites, which may
exhibit small excesses of 29Si. However, the general absence of anomalies
suggests that primitive meteorites and differentiated planetesimals formed in a
reservoir that was isotopically homogenous with respect to Si. Furthermore, the
lack of resolvable anomalies in the Calcium-Aluminum-rich Inclusion measured
here suggests that any nucleosynthetic anomalies in Si isotopes were erased
through mixing in the solar nebula prior to the formation of refractory solids.
The homogeneity exhibited by Si isotopes may have implications for the
distribution of Mg isotopes in the solar nebula. Based on supernova
nucleosynthetic yield calculations, the expected magnitude of heavy-isotope
overabundance is larger for Si than for Mg, suggesting that any potential Mg
heterogeneity, if present, exists below the 15 ppm level.

chemical composition contains signatures of the formation of terrestrial
planets in the solar system, namely small but significant depletions of the
refractory elements. To test this hypothesis, we study stars which, compared to
solar twins, have less massive convective envelopes (therefore increasing the
amplitude of the predicted effect) or are, arguably, more likely to host
planets (thus increasing the frequency of signature detections). We measure
relative atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances of a late-F type dwarf
sample (52 stars) and a sample of metal-rich solar analogs (59 stars). We
detect refractory-element depletions with amplitudes up to about 0.15 dex. The
distribution of depletion amplitudes for stars known to host gas giant planets
is not different from that of the rest of stars. The maximum amplitude of
depletion increases with effective temperature from 5650 K to 5950 K, while it
appears to be constant for warmer stars (up to 6300 K). The depletions observed
in solar twin stars have a maximum amplitude that is very similar to that seen
here for both of our samples. Gas giant planet formation alone cannot explain
the observed distributions of refractory-element depletions, leaving the
formation of rocky material as a more likely explanation of our observations.
More rocky material is necessary to explain the data of solar twins than
metal-rich stars, and less for warm stars. However, the sizes of the stars'
convective envelopes at the time of planet formation could be regulating these
amplitudes. Our results could be explained if disk lifetimes were shorter in
more massive stars, as independent observations indeed seem to suggest.

finite simple groups, except A5, admit such a structure. This conjecture has
recently been proved by Guralnick-Malle and Fairbairn-Magaard-Parker.
  In this survey we demonstrate another approach towards the proof of this
conjecture, based on probabilistic group theoretical methods, by describing the
following three works. The first is the work of Garion, Larsen and Lubotzky,
showing that the above conjecture holds for almost all finite simple groups of
Lie type. The second is the work of Garion and Penegini on Beauville structures
of alternating groups, based on results of Liebeck and Shalev, and the third is
the case of the group PSL(2,p^e), in which we give bounds on the probability of
generating a Beauville structure. We also discuss other related problems
regarding finite simple quotients of hyperbolic triangle groups and present
some open questions and conjectures.

small fraction of microbes that resists killing by antibiotics can emerge in a
population of genetically identical cells, the phenomenon known as persistence
or drug tolerance. Its characteristic signature is the biphasic kill curve,
whereby microbes exposed to a bactericidal agent are initially killed very
rapidly but then much more slowly. Here we relate this problem to the more
general problem of understanding the emergence of distinct growth phenotypes in
clonal populations. We address the problem mathematically by adopting the
framework of the phenomenon of so-called weak ergodicity breaking, well known
in dynamical physical systems, which we extend to the biological context. We
show analytically and by direct stochastic simulations that distinct growth
phenotypes can emerge as a consequence of slow-down of stochastic fluctuations
in the expression of a gene controlling growth rate. In the regime of fast gene
transcription, the system is ergodic, the growth rate distribution is unimodal,
and accounts for one phenotype only. In contrast, at slow transcription and
fast translation, weakly non-ergodic components emerge, the population
distribution of growth rates becomes bimodal, and two distinct growth
phenotypes are identified. When coupled to the well-established growth rate
dependence of antibiotic killing, this model describes the observed fast and
slow killing phases, and reproduces much of the phenomenology of bacterial
persistence. The model has major implications for efforts to develop control
strategies for persistent infections.

intelligence, human perception and cognition, mainstream computing, and
mathematics, may be understood as compression of information via the matching

intelligence"", outlined in the paper and fully described elsewhere. Relevant
evidence may be seen: in empirical support for the SP theory; in some
advantages of information compression (IC) in terms of biology and engineering;
in our use of shorthands and ordinary words in language; in how we merge
successive views of any one thing; in visual recognition; in binocular vision;
in visual adaptation; in how we learn lexical and grammatical structures in
language; and in perceptual constancies. IC via the matching and unification of
patterns may be seen in both computing and mathematics: in IC via equations; in
the matching and unification of names; in the reduction or removal of
redundancy from unary numbers; in the workings of Post's Canonical System and
the transition function in the Universal Turing Machine; in the way computers
retrieve information from memory; in systems like Prolog; and in the
query-by-example technique for information retrieval. The chunking-with-codes
technique for IC may be seen in the use of named functions to avoid repetition
of computer code. The schema-plus-correction technique may be seen in functions
with parameters and in the use of classes in object-oriented programming. And
the run-length coding technique may be seen in multiplication, in division, and
in several other devices in mathematics and computing. The SP theory resolves
the apparent paradox of ""decompression by compression"". And computing and
cognition as IC is compatible with the uses of redundancy in such things as
backup copies to safeguard data and understanding speech in a noisy

factorization at the level of the worldsheet before any Wick contractions or

factorization properties of the amplitudes themselves. In Skinner's
twistor-string this entails the addition of worldsheet gravity as well as a
formalism that represents all external states in a manifestly symmetric way,
which we develop explicitly at genus zero. We confirm that the scattering
amplitudes of Skinner's theory, as well as the gauge theory amplitudes for the
planar sector of the Berkovits-Witten theory, factorize appropriately at genus
zero. In the non-planar sector, we find behavior indicative of conformal
gravity in the Berkovits-Witten twistor-string. We contrast factorization in
twistor-strings with the story in ordinary string theory, and also make some

the proposed model, we present a simulation framework for pricing (life)
catastrophe reinsurance, based on modeling the underlying policies at
individual contract level. The accidents are first simulated at population
level, and their effect on a specific insurance company is then determined by
explicitly simulating the resulting insured deaths. The proposed
microsimulation approach can potentially lead to more accurate results than the
traditional methods, and to a better view of risk, as it can make use of all
the information available to the re/insurer and can explicitly accommodate even
complex re/insurance terms and product features. As an example we price several

However, this component appears to be subdominant in many GRBs and the origin

energy dissipation near the photosphere may produce a non-thermal spectrum and
account for such emission. Before considering such models, though, one has to
determine precise spectral and timing characteristics of the photospheric

characteristic lifetime that varies with Reynolds number. The lifetime sharply
increases with Reynolds number so that a possible divergence marking the
transition to sustained turbulence at a critical point has been discussed. We
present a mechanism by which the lifetimes increase: in the system's state
space, turbulent motion is supported by a chaotic saddle. Inside this saddle a
locally attracting periodic orbit is created and undergoes a traditional
bifurcation sequence generating chaos. The formed new 'turbulent bubble' is
initially an attractor supporting persistent chaotic dynamics. Soon after its
creation it collides with its own boundary, by which it becomes leaky and
dynamically connected with the surrounding structures. The complexity of the
chaotic saddle that supports transient turbulence hence increases by
incorporating the remnant of a new bubble. As a a result, the time it takes for
a trajectory to leave the saddle and decay to the laminar state is increased.
We demonstrate this phenomenon in plane Couette flow and show that
characteristic lifetimes vary non-smoothly and non-monotonically with Reynolds
number.

accumulation takes time, the incidence of most cancers is thought to increase
exponentially with age. However, careful measurements of the age-specific
incidence shows that the specific incidence for many forms of cancer rises with
age to a maximum, then decreases. This decrease in the age-specific incidence
with age is an anomaly. Understanding this anomaly should lead to a better
understanding of how tumors develop and grow. Here I derive the shape of the
age-specific incidence, showing that it should follow the shape of a Weibull
distribution. Measurements indicate that the age-specific incidence for colon
cancer does indeed follow a Weibull distribution. This analysis leads to the
interpretation that for colon cancer two sub-populations exist in the general
population: a susceptible population and an immune population. Colon tumors
will only occur in the susceptible population. This analysis is consistent with
the developmental origins of disease hypothesis and generalizable to many other
common forms of cancer.

illumination can heat the gap enough for the planet's orbital eccentricity to
instead be excited. We also discuss the ""Eccentricity Valley"" noted in the
known exoplanet population, where low-metallicity stars have a deficit of
eccentric planets between $\sim 0.1$ and $\sim 1$ AU compared to metal-rich

distribution may be due to the self-shadowing of the disk by a rim located at
the dust sublimation radius $\sim 0.1$ AU, which is known to exist for several
T Tauri systems. In the shadowed region between $\sim 0.1$ and $\sim 1$ AU lack
of gap insolation allows disk interactions to damp eccentricity. Outside such
shadowed regions stellar illumination can heat the planetary gaps and drive
eccentricity growth for giant planets. We suggest that the self-shadowing does
not arise at higher metallicity due to the increased optical depth of the gas
interior to the dust sublimation radius.

between different ways an organism utilizes resources, and these trade-offs can
constrain the manner in which selection can optimize traits. Limited migration
among allopatric populations and species interactions can also drive
speciation, but here we ask if trade-offs alone are sufficient to drive
speciation in the absence of other factors. We present a model to study the
effects of trade-offs on specialization and adaptive radiation in asexual
organisms based solely on competition for limiting resources, where trade-offs
are stronger the greater an organism's ability to utilize resources. In this
model resources are perfectly substitutable, and fitness is derived from the
consumption of these resources. The model contains no spatial parameters, and
is therefore strictly sympatric. We quantify the degree of specialization by
the number of ecotypes formed and the niche breadth of the population, and
observe that these are sensitive to resource influx and trade-offs. Resource
influx has a strong effect on the degree of specialization, with a clear
transition between minimal diversification at high influx and multiple species
evolving at low resource influx. At low resource influx the degree of
specialization further depends on the strength of the trade-offs, with more
ecotypes evolving the stronger trade-offs are. The specialized organisms
persist through negative frequency-dependent selection. In addition, by
analyzing one of the evolutionary radiations in greater detail we demonstrate
that a single mutation alone is not enough to establish a new ecotype, even
though phylogenetic reconstruction identifies that mutation as the branching
point. Instead, it takes a series of additional mutations to ensure the stable
coexistence of the new ecotype in the background of the existing ones,

are performed for a mixed order parameter system with an isotropic-isotropic
(I-I) phase separation that is metastable with respect to an isotropic-nematic
(I-N) phase ordering transition. Under certain conditions, the disordered phase
transforms into an ordered phase via the motion of a double front containing a
metastable phase produced by I-I demixing, a thermodynamically driven mechanism
not previously reported. Different kinetic regimes are found depending on the
location of the initial conditions in the thermodynamic phase diagram and the
ratio between diffusional and nematic phase ordering mobilities. For a
diffusional process, depending if the temperature is above or below the
critical co-dissolution point, an inflection point or a phase separation takes
place in the depletion layer. This phase separation leads to the formation of a
second interface where the separation of the two metastable isotropic phases
grows monotonically with time. The observed deviations from the typical Fickian
concentration profiles are associated with strong positive deviations of the
mixture from ideality due to couplings between concentration and nematic
ordering. Although systems of interest include liquid crystalline
nanocomposites, this novel mechanism may apply to any mixture that can undergo
an order-disorder transition and demix.

emergence of classicality is a general feature of any quantum dynamics:
observers who acquire information about a quantum system indirectly have access
at most to classical information about one and the same measurement of the
quantum system; moreover, if such information is available to many observers,
they necessarily agree. Remarkably, our analysis goes beyond the
system-environment categorization. We also provide a full characterization of
the so-called quantum discord in terms of local redistribution of correlations.

framework for solving nonperturbative QCD. The valence Fock-state wavefunctions
of the light-front QCD Hamiltonian satisfy a single-variable relativistic
equation of motion, analogous to the nonrelativistic radial Schr\""odinger
equation, with an effective confining potential U which systematically
incorporates the effects of higher quark and gluon Fock states. Remarkably, the
potential U has a unique form of a harmonic oscillator potential if one
requires that the chiral QCD action remains conformally invariant. A mass gap
arises when one extends the formalism of de Alfaro, Fubini and Furlan to
light-front Hamiltonian theory. The valence LF meson wavefunctions for zero
quark mass satisfy a single-variable relativistic equation of motion in the
invariant variable $\zeta^2=b^2_\perp x(1-x)$, which is conjugate to the
invariant mass squared. The result is a nonperturbative relativistic
light-front quantum mechanical wave equation which incorporates color
confinement and other essential spectroscopic and dynamical features of hadron
physics, including a massless pion for zero quark mass and linear Regge
trajectories with the same slope in the radial quantum number n and orbital
angular momentum L. The corresponding light-front Dirac equation provides a
model of nucleons. The same light-front equations arise from the holographic
mapping of the soft-wall model modification of AdS_5 space with a unique
dilaton profile to QCD (3+1) at fixed light-front time. Light-front holography
thus provides a precise relation between amplitudes in the fifth dimension of
AdS space and light-front wavefunctions. We also discuss the implications of
the underlying conformal template of QCD for renormalization scale-setting, and
the implications of light-front quantization for the value of the cosmological
constant.

deformation is tubular in shape. There are three competing proposals, in

drive the deformation. We use variational approaches and numerical simulations

stars and of cluster dynamics. In this paper, I first provide an overview of

the constraints obtained on the multiplicity properties of massive stars in 30

Accepted to ApJ",,"10.1088/0004-637X/786/1/21",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the core accretion hypothesis, giant planets form by gas accretion onto
solid protoplanetary cores. The minimum (or critical) core mass to form a gas
giant is typically quoted as 10 Earth masses. The actual value depends on
several factors: the location in the protoplanetary disk, atmospheric opacity,
and the accretion rate of solids. Motivated by ongoing direct imaging searches
for giant planets, this study investigates core mass requirements in the outer
disk. To determine the fastest allowed rates of gas accretion, we consider
solid cores that no longer accrete planetesimals, as this would heat the
gaseous envelope. Our spherical, two-layer atmospheric cooling model includes
an inner convective region and an outer radiative zone that matches onto the
disk. We determine the minimum core mass for a giant planet to form within a
typical disk lifetime of 3 Myr. The minimum core mass declines with disk
radius, from ~8.5 Earth masses at 5 AU to ~3.5 Earth masses at 100 AU, with
standard interstellar grain opacities. Lower temperatures in the outer disk
explain this trend, while variations in disk density are less influential. At
all distances, a lower dust opacity or higher mean molecular weight reduces the
critical core mass. Our non-self-gravitating, analytic cooling model reveals
that self-gravity significantly affects early atmospheric evolution, starting
when the atmosphere is only ~10% as massive as the core.

span the stellar mass range $(0.2-3)\times 10^{11}M_{\odot}$. Extended gas
discs exist in 83% of the snapshots. Clumps are identified by gas density in 3D
and their stellar and dark matter components are considered thereafter. While
most of the overdensities are diffuse and elongated, 91% of their mass and 83%
of their star-fromation rate (SFR) are in compact round clumps. Nearly all
galaxies have a central, massive bulge clump, while 70% of the discs show
off-center clumps, 3-4 per galaxy. The fraction of clumpy discs peaks at
intermediate disc masses. Clumps are divided based on dark-matter content into
$\textit{in-situ}$ and $\textit{ex-situ}$, originating from violent disc
instability (VDI) and minor mergers respectively. 60% of the discs are in a VDI
phase showing off-center $\textit{in-situ}$ clumps, which contribute 1-7% of
the disc mass and 5-45% of its SFR. The $\textit{in-situ}$ clumps constitute
75% of the off-center clumps in terms of number and SFR but only half the mass,
each clump containing on average 1% of the disc mass and 6% of its SFR. They
have young stellar ages, $100-400 {\rm Myr}$, and high specific SFR (sSFR),
$1-10 {\rm Gyr}^{-1}$. They exhibit gradients resulting from inward clump
migration, where the inner clumps are somewhat more massive and older, with
lower gas fraction and sSFR and higher metallicity. Similar observed gradients
indicate that clumps survive outflows. The \exsitu clumps have stellar ages
$0.5-3 {\rm Gyr}$ and sSFR $\sim 0.1-2 {\rm Gyr}^{-1}$, and they exhibit weaker
gradients. Massive clumps of old stars at large radii are likely \exsitu
mergers, though half of them share the disc rotation.

the hosts of GOODS core-collapse SNe (which cover a similar redshift range),

  Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto grid, dyadic grid, graded grid, nested grids",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto (LGL) grids play a pivotal role in nodal spectral
methods for the numerical solution of partial differential equations. They not
only provide efficient high-order quadrature rules, but give also rise to norm
equivalences that could eventually lead to efficient preconditioning techniques
in high-order methods. Unfortunately, a serious obstruction to fully exploiting
the potential of such concepts is the fact that LGL grids of different degree
are not nested. This affects, on the one hand, the choice and analysis of
suitable auxiliary spaces, when applying the auxiliary space method as a
principal preconditioning paradigm, and, on the other hand, the efficient
solution of the auxiliary problems. As a central remedy, we consider certain
nested hierarchies of dyadic grids of locally comparable mesh size, that are in
a certain sense properly associated with the LGL grids. Their actual
suitability requires a subtle analysis of such grids which, in turn, relies on
a number of refined properties of LGL grids. The central objective of this
paper is to derive just these properties. This requires first revisiting
properties of close relatives to LGL grids which are subsequently used to
develop a refined analysis of LGL grids. These results allow us then to derive
the relevant properties of the associated dyadic grids.

and broad emission lines of CIV and HeII. The system was stable in the UV to
<10% during our observations. We estimated the interstellar reddening by
fitting the 2175 A absorption feature and fit the interstellar absorption
profile of Ly$\alpha$ to directly measure the neutral hydrogen column density
along the line of sight. By comparing the UV continuum flux to steady-state
thin accretion disk models, we determined upper limits on the distance to the
system as a function of black hole mass. The continuum is well fit with disk
models dominated by viscous heating rather than irradiation. The broadband
spectral energy distribution shows the system has declined at all wavelengths
since previous broadband observations in 2005 and 2007. If we assume that the
UV emission is dominated by the accretion disk the inner radius of the disk
must be truncated at radii above the ISCO to be consistent with the X-ray flux,
requiring significant mass loss from outflows and/or energy loss via advection
into the black hole to maintain energy balance.

coupling modified Maxwell theory, which is a CPT-even Lorentz-violating

particles. It is then restricted to a special birefringent case with one
nonzero Lorentz-violating coefficient. The modified dispersion laws of

considered. After deriving the photon propagator and the polarization vectors
for a special momentum configuration we prove both unitarity at tree-level and
microcausality for the quantum field theory based on this Lorentz-violating

vanishing components and the proof of unitarity is supported by numerical
investigations in case all components are nonvanishing. The upshot is that the

possible issue for negative Lorentz-violating coefficients. The paper shall
provide a basis for the future analysis of alternative birefringent quantum

measurements of the loss functions are available. The discrete stochastic
optimization problem is widely applicable in practice, and many algorithms have
been considered to solve this kind of optimization problem. Motivated by the
efficient algorithm of simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation
(SPSA) for continuous stochastic optimization problems, we introduce the middle
point discrete simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (DSPSA)
algorithm for the stochastic optimization of a loss function defined on a
p-dimensional grid of points in Euclidean space. We show that the sequence
generated by DSPSA converges to the optimal point under some conditions.
Consistent with other stochastic approximation methods, DSPSA formally
accommodates noisy measurements of the loss function. We also show the rate of
convergence analysis of DSPSA by solving an upper bound of the mean squared
error of the generated sequence. In order to compare the performance of DSPSA
with the other algorithms such as the stochastic ruler algorithm (SR) and the
stochastic comparison algorithm (SC), we set up a bridge between DSPSA and the
other two algorithms by comparing the probability in a big-O sense of not
achieving the optimal solution. We show the theoretical and numerical

average star formation rate surface density is < \Sigma_{SFR} > = 0.55

yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$. Using the standard Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, this
corresponds to a gas mass surface density of $\Sigma_{gas}$ = 243 M$_{\odot}$
pc$^{-2}$. Integrating over the size of the galaxy we find a total gas mass of
M$_{gas}$ = 4.2 x 10$^9$ M$_{\odot}$. We estimate the gas fraction of DLA
2222-0946 to be $f_{gas}$ ~ 40%. We detect [NII]$\lambda$6583 emission at 2.5
sigma significance with a flux corresponding to a metallicity of 75% solar.
Comparing this metallicity with that derived from the low-ion absorption gas ~6
kpc away, ~30% solar, indicates possible evidence for a metallicity gradient or
enriched in/outflow of gas. Kinematically, both H-alpha and [OIII] emission
show relatively constant velocity fields over the central galactic region.
While we detect some red and blueshifted clumps of emission, they do not
correspond with rotational signatures that support an edge-on disk

models (SAMs) constrained by the K-band luminosity function and HI mass
function of local galaxies using tools of Bayesian analysis. Even with a broad
search in parameter space the whole model family fails to match to constraining
data. In the best fitting models, the star formation and feedback parameters in
low-mass haloes are tightly constrained by the two data sets, and the analysis
reveals several generic failures of models that similarly apply to other
existing SAMs. First, based on the assumption that baryon accretion follows the
dark matter accretion, large mass-loading factors are required for haloes with
circular velocities lower than 200 km/s, and most of the wind mass must be
expelled from the haloes. Second, assuming that the feedback is powered by
Type-II supernovae with a Chabrier IMF, the outflow requires more than 25% of
the available SN kinetic energy. Finally, the posterior predictive
distributions for the star formation history are dramatically inconsistent with
observations for masses similar to or smaller than the Milky-Way mass. The
inferences suggest that the current model family is still missing some key
physical processes that regulate the gas accretion and star formation in
galaxies with masses below that of the Milky Way.

(DFT) calculations based on plane waves and pseudo potentials that yield large

the DFT calculation, and formed by 11 atomic-like orbitals corresponding to
5$d$ and 3$p$ orbitals of the transition metal (W,Mo) and chalcogenide (S,Se)

the atomic spin-orbit coupling constant of the two atomic species at the unit

expression. Even though careful biochemical experimentation has revealed the
molecular mechanisms of transcription initiation for a number of different
promoters in vitro, the dynamics of this process in cells is still poorly
understood. One approach has been to measure the transcriptional output
(fluorescently labeled messenger RNAs or proteins) from single cells in a
genetically identical population, which could then be compared to predictions
from models that incorporate different molecular mechanisms of transcription
initiation. However, this approach suffers from the problem, that processes
downstream from transcription can affect the measured output and therefore mask
the signature of stochastic transcription initiation on the cell-to-cell
variability of the transcriptional outputs. Here we show theoretically that
measurements of the cell-to-cell variability in the number of nascent RNAs
provide a more direct test of the mechanism of transcription initiation. We
derive exact expressions for the first two moments of the distribution of
nascent RNA molecules and apply our theory to published data for a collection
of constitutively expressed yeast genes. We find that the measured nascent RNA
distributions are inconsistent with transcription initiation proceeding via one
rate-limiting step, which has been generally inferred from measurements of
cytoplasmic messenger RNA. Instead, we propose a two-step mechanism of
initiation, which is consistent with the available data. These findings for the
yeast promoters highlight the utility of our theory for deciphering
transcriptional dynamics in vivo from experiments that count nascent RNA
molecules in single cells.

exclusion bounds from Higgs searches at the LEP, Tevatron and LHC experiments.
From the model predictions for the Higgs masses, branching ratios, production
cross sections and total decay widths - which are specified by the user in the
input for the program - the code calculates the predicted signal rates for the
search channels considered in the experimental data. The signal rates are
compared to the expected and observed cross section limits from the Higgs
searches to determine whether a point in the model parameter space is excluded
at 95% confidence level. In this document we present a modification of the
HiggsBounds main algorithm that extends the exclusion test in order to ensure
that it provides useful results in the presence of one or more significant
excesses in the data, corresponding to potential Higgs signals. We also
describe a new method to test whether the limits from an experimental search
performed under certain model assumptions can be applied to a different
theoretical model. Further developments discussed here include a framework to
take into account theoretical uncertainties on the Higgs mass predictions, and
the possibility to obtain the $\chi^2$ likelihood of Higgs exclusion limits
from LEP. Extensions to the user subroutines from earlier versions of
HiggsBounds are described. The new features are demonstrated by additional

budget (especially in multiuser settings). Despite its importance, the design
and evaluation of aggregation algorithms has not received the same attention

rotating black holes. The extremal EMd black holes show proportionality of
their horizon area and their angular momenta. Thus the charge does not enter.
We also address the Einstein-Maxwell case, where the extremal rotating black
holes exhibit two branches. On the branch emerging from the Myers-Perry
solutions their angular momenta are proportional to their horizon area, whereas
on the branch emerging from the static solutions their angular momenta are
proportional to their horizon angular momenta. Only subsets of the near-horizon
solutions are realized globally. Investigating the physical properties of these
EMd black holes, we note that one can learn much about the extremal rotating
solutions from the much simpler static solutions. The angular momenta of the
extremal black holes are proportional to the area of the static ones for the
Kaluza-Klein value of the dilaton coupling constant, and remain analogous for
other values. The same is found for the horizon angular velocities of the
extremal black holes, which possess an analogous behavior to the surface
gravity of the static black holes. The gyromagnetic ratio is rather well

has the embedded elements of lower scale grain to grain contacts. Continuum
models developed from this framework will possess two different phases
idealizing the solid grains and their interactions. As a consequence, two
different constitutive relationships, corresponding to the grain to grain
contact and bulk behavior, co-exist in a constitutive model and govern the
response of the model. To be specific, grain to grain sliding under dry or wet
condition is idealized and appears as a simple contact law embedded in a
continuum framework. There is no need to define plastic strain, as this
quantity naturally emerges at the continuum scale as the consequence of
frictional sliding at the lower scale. In addition, the effective stress can be
naturally worked out from the grain to grain contact law embedded in the model
without being subjected to any interpretation. This, in our opinion, is a
closer representation of unsaturated soil behavior, compared to existing
continuum approaches that map everything onto a single stress-strain
relationship. In this paper, the framework is presented in its simplest form
that takes into account sliding on a single orientation. Grain to grain contact
law with capillary effects is used for the demonstration of the concept, and
the technical details behind it. Generalization of the framework for better
representation of unsaturated soil behavior will also be sketched out.

phase-evolution parameters. The division is useful in part because the
Jaranowski-Krolak-Schutz (JKS) coordinates on the four-dimensional amplitude
parameter space allow the GW signal to be written as a linear combination of
four template waveforms with the JKS coordinates as coefficients. We define a
new set of coordinates on the amplitude parameter space, with the same
properties, which is more closely connected to the physical amplitude
parameters. These naturally divide into two pairs of Cartesian-like coordinates
on two-dimensional subspaces, one corresponding to left- and the other to
right-circular polarization. We thus refer to these as CPF (circular
polarization factored) coordinates. The corresponding two sets of polar
coordinates (known as CPF-polar) can be related in a simple way to the physical

associated with left- and right-circular polarization, which correspond to the
origins of the two two-dimensional subspaces; and an elucidation of the form of

groups of derived categories of noetherian schemes and their Milnor variants

that our Chow groups agree with the classical ones for regular schemes.
Moreover, we also define tangent spaces to our Chow groups as usually and

  Processes",,,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider queueing output processes of some elementary queueing models such
as the M/M/1/K queue and the M/G/1 queue. An important performance measure for
these counting processes is their variance curve, indicating the variance of
the number of served customers over a time interval. Recent work has revealed
some non-trivial properties dealing with the asymptotic rate at which the
variance curve grows. In this paper we add to the results by finding explicit
expressions for the second order approximation of the variance curve, namely
the y-intercept of the linear asymptote.
  For M/M/1/K queues our results are based on the Drazin inverse of the
generator. It turns out that by viewing output processes as MAPs (Markovian
Arrival Processes) and considering the Drazin inverse, one can obtain explicit
expressions for the y-intercept, together with some further insight regarding
the BRAVO effect (Balancing Reduces Asymptotic Variance of Outputs). For M/G/1
queues our results are based on a classic transform of D.J. Daley. In this case
we represent the y-intercept of the variance curve in terms of the first three
moments of the service time distribution.
  A further performance measure that we are able to calculate for both models,
is the asymptotic covariance between the queue length and the number of
arrivals or departures. In addition we shed light on a classic conjecture of
Daley, dealing with characterization of stationary M/M/1 queues within the
class of stationary M/G/1 queues, based on the variance curve.

typical values of their fluid-to-magnetic flux ratio, $F$, and specific angular

geometrical shape of winds for different values of these parameters and
delineate the values that produce the widest and narrowest opening angles of
these winds, quantities necessary in the determination of the statistics of AGN
obscuration. We find that winds with smaller $H$ show a poloidal geometry of
narrower opening angles with their \Alfven\ surface at lower inclination angles
and therefore they produce the highest line of sight (LoS) velocities for
observers at higher latitudes with the respect to the disk plane. We further
note a physical and spatial correlation between the X-ray WAs and UFOs that
form along the same LoS to the observer but at different radii, $r$, and
distinct values of $n$, $\xi$ and $v$ consistent with the latest spectroscopic
data of radio-quiet Seyfert galaxies. We also show that, at least in the case

\emph{strongly} charged plate inside a dilute $m:-n$ electrolyte. We do this by
calculating the electrostatic Green's function in the presence of a nonlinear
background potential, the latter having been obtained using the nonlinear
Poisson-Boltzmann theory. We consider the general case where the dielectric
constants of the plate and the electrolyte are distinct. The following generic
results emerge from our analyses: (1) If the distance to the plate $\Delta z$
is much larger than a Gouy-Chapman length, the plate surface will behave
effectively as an infinitely charged surface, and the dielectric constant of
the plate effectively plays no role. (2) If $\Delta z$ is larger than a
Gouy-Chapman length but shorter than a Debye length, the correlation potential
can be interpreted in terms of an image charge that is three times larger than
the source charge. This behavior is independent of the valences of the ions.
(3) The Green's function vanishes inside the plate if the surface charge
density is infinitely large; hence the electrostatic potential is constant
there. In this respect, a strongly charged plate behaves like a conductor
plate. (4) If $\Delta z$ is smaller than a Gouy-Chapman length, the correlation
potential is dominated by the conventional image charge due to the dielectric
discontinuity at the interface. (5) If $\Delta z$ is larger than a Debye
length, the leading order behavior of the correlation potential will depend on
the valences of the ions in the electrolyte. Furthermore, inside an
\emph{asymmetric} electrolyte, the correlation potential is \emph{singly}
screened, i.e., it undergoes exponential decay with a decay width equal to the
Debye length.

a theoretical support to Fast Fourier Transform-based methods for numerical

deletion of links among a set of actors (e.g. individuals or organizations).
Longitudinal social networks are studied by network science and social science
researchers to understand networke volution, trend propagation, friendship and
belief formation, diffusion of innovation, the spread of deviant behavior and
more. In the current literature, there are different approaches and methods
(e.g. Sampsons approach and the markov model) to study the dynamics of
longitudinal social networks. These approaches and methods have mainly been
utilised to explore evolutionary changes of longitudinal social networks from
one state to another and to explain the underlying reasons for these changes.
However, they cannot quantify the level of dynamicity of the over time network
changes and the contribution of individual network members (i.e. actors) to
these changes. In this study, we first develop a set of measures to quantify
different aspects of the dynamicity of a longitudinal social network. We then
apply these measures, in order to conduct empirical investigations, to two
different longitudinal social networks. Finally, we discuss the implications of
the application of these measures and possible future research directions of

comparing the K-S law in the disk and the central regions of IC 342, we found
that the power law index of K-S law (N) increases toward the central region.
Furthermore, the dependence of N on Sigma_H2 is observed. Specifically, N
increases with Sigma_H2. The derived N in this work and previous observations
are consistent with the implication that star formation is likely triggered by
gravitational instability in the disk (low-Sigma_H2 region) of IC 342 and both
gravitational instability and cloud-cloud collisions in the central region

of long memory fractionally integrated processes. The re-sampling method is
based on the semi-parametric sieve approach, whereby the dynamics in the
process used to produce the bootstrap draws are captured by an autoregressive
approximation. Application of the sieve method to data pre-filtered by a
semi-parametric estimate of the long memory parameter is also explored.
Higher-order improvements yielded by both forms of re-sampling are demonstrated
using Edgeworth expansions for a broad class of statistics that includes first-
and second-order moments, the discrete Fourier transform and regression
coefficients. The methods are then applied to the problem of estimating the
sampling distributions of the sample mean and of selected sample
autocorrelation coefficients, in experimental settings. In the case of the
sample mean, the pre-filtered version of the bootstrap is shown to avoid the
distinct underestimation of the sampling variance of the mean which the raw
sieve method demonstrates in finite samples, higher order accuracy of the
latter notwithstanding. Pre-filtering also produces gains in terms of the
accuracy with which the sampling distributions of the sample autocorrelations
are reproduced, most notably in the part of the parameter space in which
asymptotic normality does not obtain. Most importantly, the sieve bootstrap is
shown to reproduce the (empirically infeasible) Edgeworth expansion of the
sampling distribution of the autocorrelation coefficients, in the part of the
parameter space in which the expansion is valid.

InAs (110) quantum wells when the magnetic field in the Voigt configuration is
much stronger than the spin-orbit-coupled field. The transverse and
longitudinal spin relaxations are discussed both analytically and numerically.
For the transverse configuration, it is found that the spin relaxation is very
sensitive to the Hartree-Fock effective magnetic field, which is very different
from the conventional D'yakonov-Perel' spin relaxation. Even an extremely small
spin polarization ($P=0.1\%$) can significantly influence the behavior of the
spin relaxation. It is further revealed that this comes from the {\em unique}
form of the effective inhomogeneous broadening, originated from the mutually
perpendicular spin-orbit-coupled field and strong magnetic field. It is shown
that this effective inhomogeneous broadening is very small and hence very
sensitive to the Hartree-Fock field. Moreover, we further find that in the spin
polarization dependence, the transverse spin relaxation time decreases with the
increase of the spin polarization in the intermediate spin polarization regime,
which is also very different from the conventional situation, where the spin
relaxation is always suppressed by the Hartree-Fock field. It is revealed that
this {\em opposite} trends come from the additional spin relaxation channel
induced by the HF field. For the longitudinal configuration, we find that the
spin relaxation can be either suppressed or enhanced by the Hartree-Fock field
if the spin polarization is parallel or antiparallel to the magnetic field.

detection of the high energy cutoff around 130 keV shows some constraints on
the radiation mechanisms of magnetars and possibly probes the differences
between magnetar and accretion models for these special class of neutron stars.
Future HXMT observations could provide stronger constraints on the hard X-ray
spectral properties of this source and other magnetar candidates.

dynamics for both short times and long times. We discover that there exists a
universal critical initial slip related to a small initial order parameter
$M_0$. In this stage, the order parameter $M$ increases with the imaginary time
$\tau$ as $M\propto M_0\tau^\theta$ with a universal initial slip exponent
$\theta$. For the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model, we estimate
$\theta$ to be $0.373$, which is markedly distinct from its classical
counterpart. Apart from the local order parameter, we also show that the
entanglement entropy exhibits universal behavior in the short-time region. As
the critical exponents in the early stage and in equilibrium are identical, we
apply the short-time dynamics method to determine quantum critical properties.
The method is generally applicable in both the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm
and topological phase transitions.

way relaying user pairs to enhance the degree of freedom (DoF) and consequently
the sum throughput of the system. The proposed channel aligned pair scheduling
(CAPS) algorithm reduces the inter-pair interference and keeps the signal to

interference free in average sense when the number of user pairs become very
large. For ideal situations, where the number of user pairs grows faster than
the system signal to noise ratio (SNR), the DoF of $M$ per channel use can be
achieved when $M$ is the relay antenna size. With a limited number of pairs,
the system is overloaded and the sum rates saturate at high signal to noise

certain amount. The performance of CAPS can be further enhanced by
semi-orthogonal channel aligned pair scheduling (SCAPS) algorithm, which not

paper, we propose Laplacian colormaps, a generic framework for
structure-preserving color transformations between images. We use the image
Laplacian to capture the structural information, and show that if the color
transformation between two images preserves the structure, the respective
Laplacians have similar eigenvectors, or in other words, are approximately
jointly diagonalizable. Employing the relation between joint diagonalizability
and commutativity of matrices, we use Laplacians commutativity as a criterion
of color mapping quality and minimize it w.r.t. the parameters of a color
transformation to achieve optimal structure preservation. We show numerous

effectiveness of the proposed method is showed by simulating, random sampling,

the proposed method over boxcar filtering and thin plate methods. It is also
found that the reconstruction performance depends on both of the fBm's Hurst
parameter and the number of samples, which in fact is consistent with the CS
reconstruction theory. In contrast to other fBm or fractal interpolation
methods, the proposed CS based method does not require the knowledge of fractal
parameters in the reconstruction process; the inherent sparsity is just
sufficient for the CS to do the reconstruction. Potential applicability of the

observing runs collecting high-resolution spectra, complementary NIR spectra,
multicolour photometric data, and X-ray observations. The photospheric
absorption lines are weakened. This veiling becomes extremely strong on
occasion, and we show that this effect is due to narrow emission lines that
fill in the photospheric lines. The blue-shifted wings in the optical emission
lines of He I, attributed to a stellar wind, are remarkably stable in
equivalent width. In contrast, the red-shifted wings change dramatically in
strength depending on rotational phase. From the pattern of variability we
infer that these wings originate in accreting gas close to the star, and that
the accretion funnels are bent and trail the hot spot. Forbidden emission lines
are very stable over the entire observing period and originate in the disk
wind. A system of narrow blue-shifted absorption features seen in lines of Ca
II and Na I can be traced to a disk wind as well. Slightly blue-shifted
emission components are present in the forbidden lines and might be related to
a wide angle molecular disk wind.

the stability of their trajectories, as described by the curvature of their
Lagrangian configuration manifold of particle positions --- a context in which
subtle spurious effects originating from the singularity in the two body
potential become particularly clear. We focus on the case of spherical systems,
which support only regular orbits in the collisionless limit, despite the
persistence of local exponential instability of $N$-body trajectories in the
anomalous case of discrete point particle representation even as $N \rightarrow
\infty$. When the singularity in the potential is removed, this apparent
contradiction disappears. In the absence of fluctuations, equilibrium
configurations generally correspond to positive scalar curvature, and thus
support stable trajectories. A null scalar curvature is associated with an
effective, averaged, equation of state describing dynamically relaxed
equilibria with marginally stable trajectories. The associated configurations
are quite similar to those of observed elliptical galaxies and simulated
cosmological halos, and are necessarily different from the systems dominated by
isothermal cores, expected from entropy maximization in the context of the
standard theory of violent relaxation. It is suggested that this is the case
because a system starting far from equilibrium does not reach a 'most probable
state' via violent relaxation, but that this process comes to an end as the
system finds and (settles in) a configuration where it can most efficiently
wash out perturbations. We explicitly test this interpretation by means of
direct simulations.

distribution in the inner Galaxy. We first solve the problem of the cosmic ray

dust extinction. We show that the dust extinction of the objects where the
diffuse interstellar band at 5780 Angstroms is detected is consistent with the
visual extinction derived from the supernova colors. This strongly suggests
that the dust producing the extinction is predominantly located in the
interstellar medium of the host galaxies and not in circumstellar material
associated with the progenitor system. One quarter of the supernovae display
anomalously large Na I column densities in comparison to the amount of dust
extinction derived from their colors. Remarkably, all of the cases of unusually
strong Na I D absorption correspond to ""Blueshifted"" profiles in the
classification scheme of Sternberg et al. (2011). This coincidence suggests
that outflowing circumstellar gas is responsible for at least some of the cases
of anomalously large Na I column densities. Two supernovae with unusually
strong Na I D absorption showed essentially normal K I column densities for the
dust extinction implied by their colors, but this does not appear to be a
universal characteristic. Overall, we find the most accurate predictor of
individual supernova extinction to be the equivalent width of the diffuse
interstellar band at 5780 Angstroms, and provide an empirical relation for its
use. Finally, we identify ways of producing significant enhancements of the Na
abundance of circumstellar material in both the single-degenerate and

dense nuclear matter created in high energy heavy-ion collisions.
  We have analysed data from minimum bias proton--proton collisions at centre

the LHC and reconstructed the inclusive jet cross section from charged tracks
at midrapidity. We present jet spectra reconstructed using the infrared and

thanks to an iterative scheme. Experiments are run over synthetic and
experimental data. First, simulations are generated to study the effects of
filtering parameters in terms of polarimetric reconstruction error, edge
preservation and smoothing of homogeneous areas. Comparison with other methods
shows that our approach compares well to other state of the art methods in the
extraction of polarimetric information and shows superior performance for edge
restoration and noise smoothing. The filter is then applied to experimental
data sets from ESAR and FSAR sensors (DLR) at L-band and S-band, respectively.

measured cross sections the half-height radius and diffuseness of the neutron
distribution are found to be 6.70$\pm 0.03(stat)$ fm and 0.55$\pm
0.01(stat)$$^{+0.02}_{-0.03}(sys)$ fm respectively, corresponding to a neutron
skin thickness $\Delta r_{np}$=0.15$\pm 0.03(stat)$$^{+0.01}_{-0.03}(sys)$ fm.
The results give the first successful extraction of a neutron skin with an
electromagnetic probe and indicate the skin of $^{208}$Pb has a halo character.
The measurement provides valuable new constraints on both the structure of
nuclei and the equation of state for neutron-rich matter.

that this consistency relation could be violated in Galilean inflation models

therefore interesting to investigate whether the subluminal propagation of

pair-ion) is studied by employing a kinetic theory model based on the Vlasov
and Poisson's equation with emphasizing the Tsallis's nonextensive statistics.
The possibility of the acoustic-like modes and their properties in both fully
symmetric and temperature-asymmetric cases are examined by studying the
dispersion relation, Landau damping and instability of modes. The resultant
dispersion relation in this study is compatible with the acoustic branch of the
experimental data [W. Oohara, D. Date, and R. Hatakeyama, Phys. Rev. Lett. 95,
175003 (2005)], in which the electrostatic waves have been examined in a pure
pair-ion plasma. Particularly, our study reveals that the occurrence of growing
or damped acoustic-like modes depends strongly on the nonextensivity of the
system as a measure for describing the long-range Coulombic interactions and
correlations in the plasma. The mechanism that leads to the unstable modes lies
in the heart of the nonextensive formalism yet, the mechanism of damping is the
same developed by Landau. Furthermore, the solutions of acoustic-like waves in
an equilibrium Maxwellian pair plasma are recovered in the extensive limit
($q\rightarrow1$), where the acoustic modes have only the Landau damping and no
growth.

aspects of energy degradation and the second law of thermodynamics, including
energy's availability and usefulness, changes in energy concentration, and the
tendency of energy to spread uniformly. In an effort to develop learning goals
that support teachers in building robust understandings of energy from their
existing knowledge, we studied teachers' impromptu conversations about these
topics during professional development courses about energy. Many of these
teachers' ideas appear to align with statements from the NGSS, including the
intuition that energy can be present but inaccessible, that energy can change
in its usefulness as it transforms within a system, and that energy can lose
its usefulness as it disperses, often ending up as thermal energy. Some
teachers' ideas about energy degradation go beyond what is articulated in the
NGSS, including the idea that thermal energy can be useful in some situations
and the idea that energy's usefulness depends on the objects included in a
scenario. Based on these observations, we introduce learning goals for energy
degradation and the second law of thermodynamics that (1) represent a
sophisticated physics understanding of these concepts, (2) originate in ideas
that teachers already use, and (3) align with the NGSS.

Assuming time-reversal invariance, this asymmetry is strictly zero in the Born

included. The experiment, conducted at Jefferson Lab using a 5.89 GeV electron

neutron asymmetries are negative with an average value of $(-1.09 \pm 0.38)

multiple buyers arrive and depart dynamically to exchange one commodity. We
show that there is no deterministic online double auction that is truthful and
competitive for maximising social welfare in an adversarial model. However,
given the prior information that sellers are patient and the demand is not more
than the supply, a deterministic and truthful greedy mechanism is actually
2-competitive, i.e. it guarantees that the social welfare of its allocation is
at least half of the optimal one achievable offline. Moreover, if the number of
incoming buyers is predictable, we demonstrate that an online double auction
can be reduced to an online one-sided auction, and the truthfulness and
competitiveness of the reduced online double auction follow that of the online
one-sided auction. Notably, by using the reduction, we find a truthful
mechanism that is almost 1-competitive, when buyers arrive randomly. Finally,
we argue that these mechanisms also have a promising applicability in more
general settings without assuming that sellers are patient, by decomposing a
market into multiple sub-markets.

thermal profiles and atmospheric composition of planets at different semimajor

species most affected in each case. CH$_4$ and H$_2$O are the most sensitive to
UV flux, H displaces H$_2$ as the most abundant gas in the upper atmosphere for
planets receiving a high UV flux. CH$_4$ is more abundant for cooler planets.
We explore vertical mixing, to inform degeneracies on our models and in the
resulting spectral observables. For lower pressures observable species like
H$_2$O or CO$_2$ can indicate the efficiency of vertical mixing, with larger
mixing ratios for a stronger mixing. By establishing the grid, testing the

in the course of evolution, as described by the linear Schrodinger equation,
exists in all of its possible states, but in measuring, the particle is always
detected in only one of its states. This property is called the ""collapse of
the wave function"" and was formulated by Von Neumann as one of the postulates
of quantum mechanics. However, it remains unclear at what point in time and
under what laws this transition occurs. This article demonstrates that the
collapse of the wave function may be due to the creation or annihilation of
particles (quasi-particles). The processes of the creation or annihilation of
particles play a key role in the measurements and are described on the basis of
quantum field theory. The system of equations of quantum field theory of
particles and fields is non-linear; as a result, the principle of superposition
does not hold for the theory. The collapse of the wave function is a
consequence of this non-linearity and occurs at the moment of creation
(annihilation) of a particle. This result demonstrates that the wave function
collapse can occur in both microscopic and macroscopic systems. Understanding
the mechanisms of the collapse of the wave function can lead to the creation of
microscopic devices involved in the calculations based on quantum computing.

""hunter-win""---on which the hunter can guarantee capture of the mole in bounded

bound on maximum game time on hunter-win graphs) and note that an optimal
hunter strategy need not take advantage of the hunter's unconstrained movement!
This game comes from a puzzle of unknown origin which was told to the authors
by Dick Hess.

$\theta_{13}$, we consider the sensitivity of these measurements in a study to

large scale structure formation in the most general second-order scalar-tensor
theory that may possess the Vainshtein mechanism as a screening mechanism. On
the basis of the standard perturbation theory, we derive the bispectrum being
expressed by a kernel of the second order of the density perturbations. We find
that the kernel at the leading order is characterized by one parameter, which
is determined by the solutions of the linear density perturbations, the Hubble
parameter and the other function specifying nonlinear interactions. This does
not allow for varied behavior in the bispectrum of the matter density
perturbations in the most general second-order scalar-tensor theory equipped
with the Vainshtein mechanism. We exemplify the typical behavior of the
bispectrum in a kinetic gravity braiding model.

inference (choosing A over C on the basis of knowing that A is better than B
and B is better than C). Transitivity seems to be the essence of rational
choice. We present a theoretical model of a repeated game in which the players
make a choice between three goods (e.g. food). The rules of the game refer to
the simple procedure of fair division among two players, known as the ""I cut,
you choose"" mechanism which has been widely discussed in the literature. In
this game one of the players has to make intransitive choices in order to
achieve the optimal result (for him/her and his/her co-player). The point is
that an intransitive choice can be rational. Previously, an increase in the
significance of intransitive strategies was achieved by referring to models of
quantum games. We show that \textit{relevant intransitive strategies} also
appear in the classic description of decision algorithms.

simulation-driven approximate dynamic programming. A less known aspect is that
the very reasons that make it effective in dynamic programming can also be
leveraged for using it for distributed schemes for certain matrix computations
involving non-negative matrices. In this spirit, we propose a reinforcement
learning algorithm for PageRank computation that is fashioned after analogous
schemes for approximate dynamic programming. The algorithm has the advantage of
ease of distributed implementation and more importantly, of being model-free,
i.e., not dependent on any specific assumptions about the transition
probabilities in the random web-surfer model. We analyze its convergence and
finite time behavior and present some supporting numerical experiments.

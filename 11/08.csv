In particular, flavour violation in the lepton sector looks very promising, as
high precision measurements are prospected in future experiments investigating
on $\mu\rightarrow e$ conversion in atomic nuclei: the predictions for this
observable are analysed in the context of the type I Seesaw mechanism.
Furthermore, new ideas to explain the Flavour Puzzle recently appeared, mainly
based on a possible dynamical origin of the Yukawa couplings and on flavour
symmetries. The focus of this proceeding will be set on the Minimal Flavour
Violation ansatz and on the role of the neutrino Majorana character: when an
$O(2)_{N}$ flavour symmetry acts on the right-handed neutrino sector, the
minimum of the scalar potential allows for large mixing angles -in contrast to
the simplest quark case- and predicts a maximal Majorana phase. This leads to a
strong correlation between neutrino mass hierarchy and mixing pattern.

play a functional role by eliminating trapped ligands. In addition, the MRD

the Canadian Meteor Orbit Radar (CMOR) on October 8, 2012. The peak flux
occurred at ~16:40 UT on October 8 with a maximum of 2.4 +/- 0.3 hr-1 km-2
(appropriate to meteoroid mass larger than 10-7 kg), equivalent to a ZHRmax =
9000 +/- 1000 using 5-minute intervals, using a mass distribution index of s =
1.88 +/- 0.01 as determined from the amplitude distribution of underdense
Draconid echoes. This makes the out- burst among the strongest Draconid returns
since 1946 and the highest flux shower since the 1966 Leonid meteor storm,
assuming a constant power-law distribution holds from radar to visual meteoroid
sizes. The weighted mean geocentric radiant in the time interval of 15-19h UT,
Oct 8, 2012 was {\alpha}g = 262.4 +/- 0.1 deg, {\delta}g = 55.7 +/- 0.1 deg
(epoch J2000.0). Visual observers also reported increased activity around the
peak time, but with a much lower rate (ZHR 200), suggesting that the
magnitude-cumulative num- ber relationship is not a simple power-law. Ablation
modeling of the observed meteors as a population does not yield a unique
solution for the grain size and distribution of Draconid meteoroids, but is
consistent with a typical Draconid meteoroid of mtotal between 10-6 to 10-4 kg
being composed of 10 - 100 grains. Dynamical simulations indicate that the
outburst was caused by dust particles released during the 1966 per- ihelion
passage of the parent comet, 21P/Giacobini-Zinner, although there are dis-
crepancies between the modelled and observed timing of the encounter,
presumably caused by approaches of the comet to Jupiter during 1966-1972. Based
on the results of our dynamical simulation, we predict possible increased
activity of the Draconid meteor shower in 2018, 2019, 2021 and 2025.

features of sleep are poorly understood and mathematical models are an
important tool for probing proposed biological mechanisms. The most well-known
mathematical model of sleep regulation, the two-process model, models the
sleep-wake cycle by two oscillators: a circadian oscillator and a homeostatic
oscillator. An alternative, more recent, model considers the mutual inhibition
of sleep promoting neurons and the ascending arousal system regulated by
homeostatic and circadian processes. Here we show there are fundamental
similarities between these two models. The implications are illustrated with
two important sleep-wake phenomena. Firstly, we show that in the two-process
model, transitions between different numbers of daily sleep episodes occur at
grazing bifurcations.This provides the theoretical underpinning for numerical
results showing that the sleep patterns of many mammals can be explained by the
mutual inhibition model. Secondly, we show that when sleep deprivation disrupts
the sleep-wake cycle, ostensibly different measures of sleepiness in the two
models are closely related. The demonstration of the mathematical similarities
of the two models is valuable because not only does it allow some features of
the two-process model to be interpreted physiologically but it also means that
knowledge gained from study of the two-process model can be used to inform
understanding of the mutual inhibition model. This is important because the
mutual inhibition model and its extensions are increasingly being used as a
tool to understand a diverse range of sleep-wake phenomena such as the design
of optimal shift-patterns, yet the values it uses for parameters associated
with the circadian and homeostatic processes are very different from those that
have been experimentally measured in the context of the two-process model.

in particular those arising from collective excitations, defined by nuclear
deformations. Proper treatment of such excitations is often essential to the
accurate description of reaction experimental data. Previous works have applied
different models to specific nuclei with the purpose of determining
angular-integrated cross sections. In this work, we present an extensive study
of the effects of collective couplings and nuclear deformations on integrated
cross sections as well as on angular distributions in a consistent manner for
neutron-induced reactions on nuclei in the rare-earth region. This specific
subset of the nuclide chart was chosen precisely because of a clear static
deformation pattern. We analyze the convergence of the coupled-channel
calculations regarding the number of states being explicitly coupled. Inspired
by the work done by Dietrich \emph{et al.}, a model for deforming the spherical
Koning-Delaroche optical potential as function of quadrupole and hexadecupole
deformations is also proposed. We demonstrate that the obtained results of
calculations for total, elastic and inelastic cross sections, as well as
elastic and inelastic angular distributions correspond to a remarkably good
agreement with experimental data for scattering energies above around a few

to come to their mind when presented with a certain cue. It is a task which can
be used to expose the basic mechanisms by which humans connect memories. In
this work we have made use of a publicly available database of free
associations to model the exploration of the averaged network of associations
using a statistical and the \emph{ACT-R} model. We performed, in addition, an
online experiment asking participants to navigate the averaged network using
their individual preferences for word associations. We have investigated the
statistics of word repetitions in this guided association task. We find that
the considered models mimic some of the statistical properties, viz the
probability of word repetitions, the distance between repetitions and the
distribution of association chain lengths, of the experiment, with the
\emph{ACT-R} model showing a particularly good fit to the experimental data for
the more intricate properties as, for instance, the ratio of repetitions per

them with theory. The Josephson critical current for a short-length device, L =

close to the theoretically expected value. The critical current in all other

either the superconducting gap or length of the wire. By varying the gate
voltage in suspended devices, we are able to observe a crossover from typical
tunneling transport at large negative gate voltage, with suppressed subgap

at large positive gate voltage, with enhanced Josephson current and subgap

different approach to these effects, based on the hypothesis that the observed

combined effect of PWNe evolving under different ambient conditions, the

approach, I show that most middle-age PWNe are more likely observable during
the reverberation phase, and I succeed in reproducing trends consistent with
those observed, provided that the evolution of the X-ray emitting electrons
keeps adiabatic over the whole reverberation phase. As a direct consequence, I
show that the X-ray spectra of older PWNe should be harder: also this is
consistent with observations.

structures for text indexing. Each uses linear space and can be constructed in
linear time for polynomially sized alphabets. However, when it comes to
answering queries with worst-case deterministic time bounds, the prior does so
in $O(m\log|\Sigma|)$ time, where $m$ is the query size, $|\Sigma|$ is the
alphabet size, and the latter does so in $O(m+\log n)$ time, where $n$ is the
text size. If one wants to output all appearances of the query, an additive
cost of $O(occ)$ time is sufficient, where $occ$ is the size of the output.
  We propose a novel way of combining the two into, what we call, a {\em suffix
tray}. The space and construction time remain linear and the query time
improves to $O(m+\log|\Sigma|)$ for integer alphabets from a linear range, i.e.
$\Sigma \subset \{1,\cdots, cn\}$, for an arbitrary constant $c$. The
construction and query are deterministic. Here also an additive $O(occ)$ time
is sufficient if one desires to output all appearances of the query.
  We also consider the online version of indexing, where the text arrives
online, one character at a time, and indexing queries are answered in tandem.
In this variant we create a cross between a suffix tree and a suffix list (a
dynamic variant of suffix array) to be called a {\em suffix trist}; it supports
queries in $O(m+\log|\Sigma|)$ time. The suffix trist also uses linear space.
Furthermore, if there exists an online construction for a linear-space suffix
tree such that the cost of adding a character is worst-case deterministic
$f(n,|\Sigma|)$ ($n$ is the size of the current text), then one can further
update the suffix trist in $O(f(n,|\Sigma|)+\log |\Sigma|)$ time. The best
currently known worst-case deterministic bound for $f(n,|\Sigma|)$ is $O(\log
n)$ time.

the beam size monitor source point, b) compensation of the {\zeta}a introduced

automatic generation of Fuzzy Ontology of Data Mining (FODM), through the
fusion of conceptual clustering, fuzzy logic, and FCA. In our approach, we
propose to generate ontology taking in consideration another degree of
granularity into the process of generation. Indeed, we suggest to define an
ontology between classes resulting from a preliminary classification on the

offered a better interpretation of the data and optimized both the space memory

dynamical QCD simulations with staggered quarks to study this localization
phenomenon. We show that the ""mobility edge"", separating localized and
delocalized modes, scales properly in the continuum limit and rises steeply
with the temperature. Using very high statistics simulations in large volumes
we find that the density of localized modes scales precisely with the spatial
volume and even at $T=2.6T_{c}$ the lowest part of the spectrum extends all the

The cluster is over dense in dust by about a factor of 100 compared to the
field. The same emissivity (beta) temperature relation applies for different
galaxies as that found for different regions of M31. We use optical and HI data
to show that Virgo is over dense in stars and atomic gas by about a factor of
100 and 20 respectively. Metallicity values are used to measure the mass of
metals in the gas phase. The mean metallicity is about 0.7 solar and 50% of the
metals are in the dust. For the cluster as a whole the mass density of stars in
galaxies is 8 times that of the gas and the gas mass density is 130 times that
of the metals. We use our data to consider the chemical evolution of the
individual galaxies, inferring that the measured variations in effective yield
are due to galaxies having different ages, being affected to varying degrees by
gas loss. Four galaxy scaling relations are considered: mass-metallicity,
mass-velocity, mass-star formation rate and mass-radius - we suggest that
initial galaxy mass is the prime driver of a galaxy's ultimate destiny.
Finally, we use X-ray observations and galaxy dynamics to assess the dark and
baryonic matter content compared to the cosmological model.

Applying the multitaper technique (MTM), very suitable for short and noisy data

The most remarkable result is the emergence of a significant peak (95%) of four

daily values of Q, yields a spectral peak of 120 days. It is concluded that

determined by the relativistic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Thus, even
conventional spin-transfer torques are controlled by the relativistic
spin-orbit coupling in these systems, and additional relativistic corrections
to the current-induced torques and magnetization damping become important for a
complete understanding of the current-driven magnetization dynamics. We
theoretically study the effects of reactive and dissipative homogeneous
spin-orbit torques and anisotropic damping on the current-driven skyrmion
dynamics in cubic chiral magnets. Our results demonstrate that spin-orbit
torques play a significant role in the current-induced skyrmion velocity. The
dissipative spin-orbit torque generates a relativistic Magnus force on the
skyrmions, whereas the reactive spin-orbit torque yields a correction to both
the drift velocity along the current direction and the transverse velocity
associated with the Magnus force. The spin-orbit torque corrections to the
velocity scale linearly with the skyrmion size, which is inversely proportional
to the spin-orbit coupling. Consequently, the reactive spin-orbit torque
correction can be the same order of magnitude as the non-relativistic
contribution. More importantly, the dissipative spin-orbit torque can be the
dominant force that causes a deflected motion of the skyrmions if the torque
exhibits a linear or quadratic relationship with the spin-orbit coupling. In
addition, we demonstrate that the skyrmion velocity is determined by
anisotropic magnetization damping parameters governed by the skyrmion size.

several projections of a subset of units in the layer below and computes a
normalized $L_p$ norm. We notice two interesting interpretations of the $L_p$
unit. First, the proposed unit can be understood as a generalization of a
number of conventional pooling operators such as average, root-mean-square and
max pooling widely used in, for instance, convolutional neural networks (CNN),
HMAX models and neocognitrons. Furthermore, the $L_p$ unit is, to a certain
degree, similar to the recently proposed maxout unit (Goodfellow et al., 2013)
which achieved the state-of-the-art object recognition results on a number of
benchmark datasets. Secondly, we provide a geometrical interpretation of the
activation function based on which we argue that the $L_p$ unit is more
efficient at representing complex, nonlinear separating boundaries. Each $L_p$
unit defines a superelliptic boundary, with its exact shape defined by the
order $p$. We claim that this makes it possible to model arbitrarily shaped,
curved boundaries more efficiently by combining a few $L_p$ units of different
orders. This insight justifies the need for learning different orders for each
unit in the model. We empirically evaluate the proposed $L_p$ units on a number
of datasets and show that multilayer perceptrons (MLP) consisting of the $L_p$
units achieve the state-of-the-art results on a number of benchmark datasets.
Furthermore, we evaluate the proposed $L_p$ unit on the recently proposed deep
recurrent neural networks (RNN).

or turn off two-body interactions in a rotating frame, promoting three-body
interactions arising from multi-orbital physics to leading-order processes.
This approach provides a route to strongly-correlated phases of lattice gases
that are beyond the reach of previously proposed dissipative three-body
interactions. In particular, we study the mean-field phase diagram for spinless
bosons with three- and two- body interactions, and provide a roadmap to dimer
states of varying character in 1D. This new toolset should be immediately
applicable in state-of-the-art cold atom experiments.

topologically ordered states which can have gapped boundaries. We can use a
simple ideal string-net wavefunction, which is described by a set of F-matrices
[or more precisely, a unitary fusion category (UFC)], to study all the
universal properties of such a topological order. In this paper, we describe a
finite computational method -- Q-algebra approach, that allows us to compute
the non-Abelian statistics of the topological excitations [or more precisely,
the unitary modular tensor category (UMTC)], from the string-net wavefunction

described by twisted gauge theory (i.e., twisted quantum double $D^\alpha(G)$).
Our result can also be viewed from an angle of holographic bulk-boundary
relation. The 1+1D anomalous topological orders, that can appear as edges of
2+1D topological states, are classified by UFCs which describe the fusion of
quasiparticles in 1+1D. The 1+1D anomalous edge topological order uniquely
determines the 2+1D bulk topological order (which are classified by UMTC). Our
method allows us to compute this bulk topological order (i.e., the UMTC) from
the anomalous edge topological order (i.e., the UFC).

for research areas of Environmental Sciences & Ecology and Evolutionary Biology

publications using the topic terms network, graph theory, and web while
controlling for the usage of misleading phrases. The resulting corpus entailed
29,513 publications between 1936 and 2012. We document the rapid rise in
Network Ecology publications per year reaching a magnitude of over 5% of the

that in addition to the data provided by the perturbative near-BMN expansion
and the symmetry algebra considerations there is also another source of
information about the dispersion relation -- the semiclassical giant magnon
solution. In earlier work in arXiv:1303.1037 and arXiv:1304.4099 it was found
that the symmetry algebra constraints consistent with perturbative expansion do
not completely determine the form of the dispersion relation. The aim of the
present paper is to fix it by constructing a generalization of the known dyonic
giant magnon soliton on S3 to the presence of a non-zero NS-NS flux described
by a WZ term in the string action. We find that the angular momentum of this
soliton gets shifted by a term linear in world-sheet momentum. We also discuss
the symmetry algebra of the string light-cone S-matrix and show that the exact
dispersion relation, which should have the correct perturbative BMN and
semiclassical giant magnon limits, should also contain such a linear momentum
term. The simplicity of the resulting bound-state picture provides a strong
argument in favour of this dispersion relation.

be an affine variety equipped with an action of the algebraic torus
$\mathbb{T}$. The complexity of the $\mathbb{T}$-action on $X$ is the
codimension of the general $\mathbb{T}$-orbits. Under the assumption of
normality and when the ground field is algebraically closed of characteristic
0, the variety $X$ admits a combinatorial description in terms of convex
geometry. This description obtained by Altmann and Hausen in the year 2006
generalizes the classical one for toric varieties. Our purpose is to
investigate new problems on the algebraic and geometric properties of the
variety $X$ when the $\mathbb{T}$-action on $X$ is of complexity 1. (1) In the
first part, a result gives an effective method to determine the integral
closure of any affine variety defined over an algebraically field of
characteristic 0 with a $\mathbb{T}$-action of complexity 1 in terms of the
combinatorial description of Altmann-Hausen. (2) The calculations of the first
part suggest a proof of the validity of the presentation of Altmann-Hausen in
the case of complexity 1 over an arbitrary ground field. This is done in the
second part. (3) In the third part, when the base field is perfect, we classify
all the actions of the additive group on $X$ that are normalized by the
$\mathbb{T}$-action of complexity 1. This classification generalizes classical
works of Flenner and Zaidenberg in the surface case and of Liendo when the base

each job wishes to minimize its cost, given by the workload of the server it
chooses.
  A Nash equilibrium (NE) is a strategy profile that is resilient to unilateral
deviations. Finding an NE in such a game is simple. However, an NE assignment
is not stable against coordinated deviations of several jobs, while a strong
Nash equilibrium (SNE) is. We study how well an NE approximates an SNE.
  Given any job assignment in a load balancing game, the improvement ratio (IR)
of a deviation of a job is defined as the ratio between the pre- and
post-deviation costs. An NE is said to be a r-approximate SNE (r >= 1) if there
is no coalition of jobs such that each job of the coalition will have an IR
more than r from coordinated deviations of the coalition.
  While it is already known that NEs are the same as SNEs in the 2-server load
balancing game, we prove that, in the m-server load balancing game for any
given m >= 3, any NE is a (5/4)-approximate SNE, which together with the lower
bound already established in the literature yields a tight approximation bound.
This closes the final gap in the literature on the study of approximation of
general NEs to SNEs in load balancing games. To establish our upper bound, we

a partially ionized state. Although passing electromagnetic waves are dispersed
by the plasma, the effect has hitherto not been utilized as a means of
detection because it is generally believed that a successful observation
requires the background source to be highly variable, \ie~the class of sources
that could potentially deliver a verdict is limited. We argue in two stages
that this condition is not necessary. First, by modeling the fluctuations on
macroscopic scales as interference between wave packets we show that, in
accordance with the ideas advanced by Einstein in 1917, both the behavior of
photons as bosons (\ie~the intensity variance has contributions from Poisson
and phase noise) and the van-Cittert-Zernike theorem are a consequence of
wave-particle duality. Nevertheless, we then point out that in general the
variance on some macroscopic timescale $\tau$ consists of (a) a main
contributing term $\propto 1/\tau$, plus (b) a small negative term $\propto
1/\tau^2$ due to the finite size of the wave packets. If the radiation passes
through a dispersive medium, this size will be enlarged well beyond its vacuum
minimum value of $\Delta t \approx 1/\Delta\nu$, leading to a more negative (b)
term (while (a) remains unchanged) and hence a suppression of the variance
w.r.t. the vacuum scenario. The phenomenon, which is typically at the few parts
in 10$^5$ level, enables one to measure cosmological dispersion in principle.
Signal-to-noise estimates, along with systematic issues and how to overcome
them, will be presented.

anti-retroviral therapy (ART), has kept more people alive than any other
country. The effectiveness, availability and affordability of potent
anti-retroviral therapy (ART) make it possible to contemplate ending the
epidemic of HIV/AIDS. We consider what would have happened without ART, the
impact of the current roll-out of ART, what might be possible if early
treatment becomes available to all, and what could have happened if ART had
been provided much earlier in the epidemic. In 2013 the provision of ART has
reduced the prevalence of HIV from an estimated 15% to 9% among adults not on
ART, the annual incidence from 2% to 0.9%, and the AIDS related deaths from
0.9% to 0.3% p.a. saving 1.5 million lives and USD727M. Regular testing and
universal access to ART could reduce the prevalence among adults not on ART in
2023 to 0.06%, annual incidence to 0.05%, and eliminate AIDS deaths. Cumulative
costs between 2013 ands 2023 would increase by USD692M only 4% of the total
cost of USD17Bn. If a universal testing and early treatment had started in 1998
the prevalence of HIV among adults not on ART in 2013 would have fallen to
0.03%, annual incidence to 0.03%, and saved 2.5 million lives. The cost up to
2013 would have increased by USD18Bn but this would have been cost effective at
US$7,200 per life saved. Future surveys of HIV among women attending ante-natal
clinics should include testing women for the presence of anti-retroviral drugs,
measuring their viral loads, and using appropriate assays for estimating HIV
incidence. These data would make it possible to develop better and more
reliable estimates of the current state of the epidemic, the success of the

  and the implied metallicity of the IGM","Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stt2175",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We explore the dependence of the galaxy mass-metallicity relation on
environment in SDSS, in terms of both over-density and central/satellite
dichotomy. We find that at a given stellar mass, there is a strong dependence
of metallicity on over-density for star-forming satellites. Instead, for
star-forming centrals no correlation is found. Star-forming satellites at
different stellar masses form a tight sequence in the average overdensity -
metallicity plane, which covers the entire observed range of metallicities and
stellar masses. This remarkable result appears to imply that there exists a
universal evolutionary path for all star-forming satellites, regardless of
their stellar masses. The strong correlation between over-density and
metallicity for star-forming satellites indicates that the gas inflow of
satellite galaxies is progressively metal-enriched in denser regions. We
interpret our results by employing the gas regulator model and find that the
metallicity of the enriched inflow of star-forming satellite galaxies strongly
increases with increasing over-density, largely independently of stellar mass.
If the metallicity of the inflow of star-forming satellites can represent the
metallicity of the IGM, then the implied metallicity of the IGM rises from ~
0.01 solar metallicity in void-like environments to ~ 0.3 solar metallicity in
cluster-like environments, in broad agreement with observations. We show that
the observed metallicity difference between star-forming centrals and
star-forming satellites becoming smaller towards high stellar masses can be
simply explained by the mass-independent enriched inflow, without the need to
involve any mass-dependent environmental effect on metallicity. Since satellite
galaxies account for at least half of the galaxy population, our findings
prompt for a revision of many galaxy evolutionary models, which generally
assume pristine gas inflows.

classical spin ices the excitations are akin to electrostatic charges, in the

galaxy-halo relationship, such as the halo occupation distribution (HOD) and/or
conditional luminosity function (CLF), to assume that halo mass alone suffices
to determine a halo's resident galaxy population. Yet, the clustering strength
of cold dark matter halos depends upon halo properties in addition to mass,
such as formation time, an effect referred to as assembly bias. If galaxy
characteristics are correlated with any of these auxiliary halo properties, the
basic assumption of HOD/CLF methods is violated. We estimate the potential for
assembly bias to induce systematic errors in inferred halo occupation
statistics. We use halo abundance matching and age matching to construct
fiducial mock galaxy catalogs that exhibit assembly bias as well as additional
mock catalogs with identical HODs, but with assembly bias removed. We fit a
parameterized HOD to the projected two-point clustering of mock galaxies in
each catalog to assess the systematic errors induced by reasonable levels of
assembly bias. In the absence of assembly bias, the inferred HODs generally
describe the true underlying HODs well, validating the basic methodology.
However, in all of the cases with assembly bias, the inferred HODs have
systematic errors that are statistically significant. In most cases, these
systematic errors cannot be identified using void statistics as auxiliary
observables. We conclude that the galaxy-halo relationship inferred from galaxy
clustering should be subject to a non-negligible systematic error induced by
assembly bias. Our work suggests that efforts to model and/or constrain
assembly bias should be high priorities as it is a threatening source of
systematic error in galaxy evolution studies as well as the precision cosmology
program.

with the structures determined by mass continuity, momentum and energy
conservation equations in spherical symmetry. The cluster comprises a dark
matter halo (DM) and ionised X-ray emitting intracluster gas (ICM), which
jointly determine the gravitational potential. The cD galaxy is an additive
gravitational potential component. The DM assumes a polytropic equation of
state (determined by its microphysics), which could be non-radiative
self-interacting particles or more exotically interacting particles. The AGN
provides distributed heating, counteracting radiative cooling. Stationary
density and velocity dispersion profiles are obtained by numerically
integrating the hydrodynamic equations with appropriate boundary conditions.
The minimum gas temperature in the cluster core is higher when a cD galaxy is
present than when it is absent. The solutions also yield a point-like mass
concentration exceeding a minimum mass: presumably the AGN's supermassive black
hole (SMBH). Consistency with observed SMBH masses constrains the possible DM
equations of state. The constraints are looser when a cD galaxy is present.
Distributed (AGN) heating alters cluster global properties, and also reduces
the lower limits for the central point-mass, for the preferred DM models in
which the dark particles have greater heat capacity than point particles.
Eluding these constraints would require dominant non-spherical or anisotropic
effects (e.g. bulk rotation, non-radial streaming, asymmetric lumps, or a
strong magnetic field).

functions using Schwinger-Feynman proper-time techniques, always in the
background field method (BFM) Feynman gauge for technical convenience, and so
far only at one loop. We already know that these results are gauge-invariant,
because this gauge realizes the prescriptions of the Pinch Technique (PT), a
Feynman-graph formulation for any gauge, but the idea of the first exercise is
to show this directly in OSSIM. In this exercise we extend proper-time OSSIM
beyond the BFM Feynman gauge so that one can apply PT algorithms, and show that
the intrinsic PT is equivalent to resolving ambiguities in OSSIM in other
gauges. In the second exercise we use forty-year-old rules of the author and
Tiktopoulos for expressing loop integrals with numerator momenta directly in
terms of Feynman parameters after momentum integration (the goal of OSSIM) and
show that these rules elegantly and with economy of effort give rise, at least
at one loop, to standard OSSIM algorithms. In the third exercise we apply
world-line techniques to the problem of the breaking of adjoint strings,
requiring a non-perturbative treatment that in the end reduces to a variant of
the Schwinger result for production of electron-positron pairs in an electric
field. This generalizes OSSIM to non-perturbative processes.

to a non-Gaussian, nonlinear test problem, where we assume we know the optimal
stochastic parameterization and the correct observation model. We show that
when the parameterization is inappropriate, parameters chosen for good filter
performance may give poor equilibrium statistical estimates and vice versa.
Given the correct parameterization, it is imperative to estimate the parameters
simultaneously and to account for the nonlinear feedback of the stochastic
parameters into the reduced filter estimates. In numerical experiments on the
two-layer Lorenz-96 model, we find that parameters estimated online, as part of
a filtering procedure, produce accurate filtering and equilibrium statistical
prediction. In contrast, a linear regression based offline method, which fits
the parameters to a given training data set independently from the filter,
yields filter estimates which are worse than the observations or even divergent
when the slow variables are not fully observed.

various electrical quantities, including voltages, currents, dissipated powers

\operatorname{log}(N), 1/\lambda, 1/\epsilon)$, where $N$ is the number of

necessary. This implies that our algorithms are optimal up to polynomial
factors and cannot be significantly improved.

geometric quantization. Since this theory has a mass gap proportional to the
topological mass m, Yang-Mills contribution decays exponentially at very large
distances compared to 1/m, leaving a pure Chern-Simons theory with level number
k. In this paper, the near Chern-Simons limit is studied where the distance is
large enough to give an almost topological theory, with a small contribution
from the Yang-Mills term. It is shown that this almost topological theory
consists of two copies of Chern-Simons with level number k/2, very similar to
the Chern-Simons splitting of topologically massive AdS gravity. Also, gauge
invariance of these half-Chern-Simons theories is discussed. As m approaches to
infinity, the split parts add up to give the original Chern-Simons term with
level k. Reduction of the phase space is discussed in this limit. Finally, a
relation between the observables of topologically massive Yang-Mills theory and
Chern-Simons theory is shown. One of the two split Chern-Simons pieces is shown
to be associated with Wilson loops while the other with 't Hooft loops. This
allows one to use skein relations to calculate topologically massive Yang-Mills

circulation around an idealized coastal cape representing typical summertime
circulation along the northwest coast of the U.S., studied using a mesoscale
coupled ocean-atmosphere modeling system. The orographic wind maximum features
a strong NW flow extending a few hundred kilometers downstream and seaward of
the cape, which closely follows mesoscale orographic low pressure developed in
the lee of the cape. Both wind maximum and the lee trough experience a
pronounced diurnal cycle, marked by maximum northwest flow and minimum pressure
in the local evening hours (its opposite phase during morning hours), and
confirmed by observations from limited buoy and coastal stations.
  Vertical structure of the atmospheric boundary layer over the coastal ocean
on the lee side of the cape indicated the downward propagation of potential
temperature and wind features during the course of the day, as opposed to the
traditional surface-driven development of the atmospheric boundary layer.
Momentum analysis showed the local pressure gradients near the surface vary
greatly depending on the relative location about the cape. Strong perturbations
in relative vorticity downwind of the cape supported the hypothesis that
mountain dynamics have a key role in establishing wind regime around the cape.
The sensitivity studies indicated the importance of coastal terrain elevation
on the formation and the strength of the lee trough and wind maximum. Higher
coastal topography was found to cause greater separation of the upwelling front

interface between dissimilar elastic solids is presented. The boundary integral
equations can be written in two equivalent forms: (a) The tractions can be
written as a space-time convolution of the displacement continuities at the
interface (Budiansky and Rice, 1979) (b) The displacement discontinuities can
be written as a space-time convolution of the tractions at the interface
(Kostrov, 1966). Prior work on spectral formulation of the boundary integral
equations has adopted the former as the starting point. The present work has
for its basis the latter form based on a space-time convolution of the
tractions. Tractions and displacement components are given a spectral
representation in the spatial coordinate along the interface. The radiation
damping term is then explicitly extracted to avoid singularities in the
convolution kernels. With the spectral forms introduced, the space-time
convolutions reduce to convolutions in time for each Fourier mode. Due to
continuity of tractions at the interface, this leads to a simpler formulation
and form of the convolution kernels in comparison to the formulation involving
convolutions over the slip and opening history at the bi-material interface.
The convolution kernels are validated by studying some model problems to which
analytical solutions are known. When coupled with a cohesive law or a friction
law at the interface, the formulation proposed here is of wide applicability
for studying spontaneous rupture propagation.

The injected magnetic helicity is computed with the vector magnetic and

power consumption in smart grids. To provide incentives for consumers to shift
their consumption to off-peak times, the utility company charges consumers
differential pricing for using power at different times of the day. Consumers
take into account these differential prices when deciding when and how much
power to consume daily. Importantly, while consumers enjoy lower billing costs
when shifting their power usage to off-peak times, they also incur discomfort
costs due to the altering of their power consumption patterns. Existing works
propose stationary strategies for the myopic consumers to minimize their
short-term billing and discomfort costs. In contrast, we model the interaction
emerging among self-interested, foresighted consumers as a repeated energy
scheduling game and prove that the stationary strategies are suboptimal in
terms of long-term total billing and discomfort costs. Subsequently, we propose
a novel framework for determining optimal nonstationary DSM strategies, in
which consumers can choose different daily power consumption patterns depending
on their preferences, routines, and needs. As a direct consequence of the
nonstationary DSM policy, different subsets of consumers are allowed to use
power in peak times at a low price. The subset of consumers that are selected
daily to have their joint discomfort and billing costs minimized is determined
based on the consumers' power consumption preferences as well as on the past
history of which consumers have shifted their usage previously. Importantly, we
show that the proposed strategies are incentive-compatible. Simulations confirm
that, given the same peak-to-average ratio, the proposed strategy can reduce
the total cost (billing and discomfort costs) by up to 50% compared to existing
DSM strategies.

addresses the inference problem of denoising, deconvolving, and decomposing
photon observations. Its primary goal is the simultaneous but individual
reconstruction of the diffuse and point-like photon flux given a single photon
count image, where the fluxes are superimposed. In order to discriminate
between these morphologically different signal components, a probabilistic
algorithm is derived in the language of information field theory based on a
hierarchical Bayesian parameter model. The signal inference exploits prior
information on the spatial correlation structure of the diffuse component and
the brightness distribution of the spatially uncorrelated point-like sources. A
maximum a posteriori solution and a solution minimizing the Gibbs free energy
of the inference problem using variational Bayesian methods are discussed.
Since the derivation of the solution is not dependent on the underlying
position space, the implementation of the D3PO algorithm uses the NIFTY package
to ensure applicability to various spatial grids and at any resolution. The
fidelity of the algorithm is validated by the analysis of simulated data,
including a realistic high energy photon count image showing a 32 x 32 arcmin^2

random numbers. We consider variance bounding Markov chains driven by a
deterministic sequence of numbers. The star-discrepancy provides a measure of
efficiency of such Markov chain quasi-Monte Carlo methods. We define a
pull-back discrepancy of the driver sequence and state a close relation to the
star-discrepancy of the Markov chain-quasi Monte Carlo samples. We prove that
there exists a deterministic driver sequence such that the discrepancies
decrease almost with the Monte Carlo rate $n^{1/2}$. As for MCMC simulations, a
burn-in period can also be taken into account for Markov chain quasi-Monte
Carlo to reduce the influence of the initial state. In particular, our
discrepancy bound leads to an estimate of the error for the computation of
expectations. To illustrate our theory we provide an example for the Metropolis
algorithm based on a ball walk. Furthermore, under additional assumptions we
prove the existence of a driver sequence such that the discrepancy of the
corresponding deterministic Markov chain sample decreases with order
$n^{-1+\delta}$ for every $\delta>0$.

tunneling spectrum in the underdoped regime weakens with increasing doping, and
then the symmetric tunneling spectrum recovers in the heavily overdoped regime.
The theory also shows that the asymmetric tunneling is a natural consequence
due to the presence of the normal-state pseudogap.

The H$_2$O masers in VLA 3, the most massive YSO in AFGL 2591 ($\sim$

mas ($\lesssim$ 130 AU) from VLA 3. In contrast to other H$_2$O masers in AFGL

from the other axioms). Without this axiom, the axiom system is indeed
independent. Second, whereas most of the original independence models were
infinite, finite independence models are available. Moreover, the independence
proof for one of the axioms employed proof-theoretic techniques rather than

For every axiom, then, there is a finite independence model. Finally, the axiom

large tracts of mathematical knowledge have been formalized with the help of
the Mizar system. Because Mizar is based on first-order classical logic and set
theory, and because of its emphasis on pure mathematics, the Mizar library
offers a cornucopia for the researcher interested in foundations of
mathematics. With Mizar, one can adopt an experimental approach and take on
problems in foundations, at least those which are amenable to such
experimentation. Addressing a question posed by H. Friedman, we use Mizar to
take on the question of surveying the sentence complexity (measured by
quantifier alternation) of mathematical theorems. We find, as Friedman
suggests, that the sentence complexity of most Mizar theorems is universal
($\Pi_{1}$, or $\forall$), and as one goes higher in the sentence complexity
hierarchy the number of Mizar theorems having these complexities decreases
rapidly. The results support the intuitive idea that mathematical statements,
even when carried out an abstract set-theoretical style, are usually quite low
in the sentence complexity hierarchy (not more complex than
$\forall\exists\forall$ or $\exists\forall$).

spiking, while for intermediate widths only spiking with low degree of

the galaxy cluster CL0024+17 at $z\sim 0.4$ observed with the prime focus
camera (LBC) at LBT. The measure required an accurate removal of the galaxies
light within $\sim 200$ kpc from the center. The residual background intensity
has then been integrated in circular apertures to derive the average ICL
intensity profile. The latter shows an approximate exponential decline as
expected from theoretical cold dark matter models. The radial profile of the
ICL over the galaxies intensity ratio (ICL fraction) is increasing with
decreasing radius but near the cluster center it starts to bend and then
decreases where the overlap of the halos of the brightest cluster galaxies
becomes dominant. Theoretical expectations in a simplified CDM scenario show
that the ICL fraction profile can be estimated from the stripped over galaxy
stellar mass ratio in the cluster. It is possible to show that the latter
quantity is almost independent of the properties of the individual host
galaxies but mainly depends on the average cluster properties. The predicted
ICL fraction profile is thus very sensitive to the assumed CDM profile, total
mass and concentration parameter of the cluster. Adopting values very similar
to those derived from the most recent lensing analysis in CL0024+17 we find a
good agreement with the observed ICL fraction profile. The galaxy counts in the
cluster core have then been compared with that derived from composite cluster
samples in larger volumes, up to the clusters virial radius. The galaxy counts
in the CL0024+17 core appear flatter and the amount of bending respect to the
average cluster galaxy counts imply a loss of total emissivity in broad
agreement with the measured ICL fraction.

without prior information, the emergent, mesoscopic organization determined by
groups of units whose dynamical activity is more strongly correlated internally
than with the rest of the system. The existing techniques to filter
correlations are not explicitly oriented towards identifying such modules and
can suffer from an unavoidable information loss. A promising alternative is
that of employing community detection techniques developed in network theory.
Unfortunately, this approach has focused predominantly on replacing network
data with correlation matrices, a procedure that tends to be intrinsically
biased due to its inconsistency with the null hypotheses underlying the
existing algorithms. Here we introduce, via a consistent redefinition of null
models based on random matrix theory, the appropriate correlation-based
counterparts of the most popular community detection techniques. Our methods
can filter out both unit-specific noise and system-wide dependencies, and the
resulting communities are internally correlated and mutually anti-correlated.
We also implement multiresolution and multifrequency approaches revealing
hierarchically nested sub-communities with `hard' cores and `soft' peripheries.
We apply our techniques to several financial time series and identify
mesoscopic groups of stocks which are irreducible to a standard, sectorial
taxonomy, detect `soft stocks' that alternate between communities, and discuss
implications for portfolio optimization and risk management.

2) this asymmetry in temperature is likely to be the result of an inversely
proportional relationship between the total thermospheric heating rate (Joule
heating and ion drag) and magnetic field strength - i.e. the larger northern
field strength leads to reduced total heating rate and a reduced temperature,
irrespective of season, and 3) this implies that thermospheric heating and

this paper we focus on a case study for the tetra-quadric - a Calabi-Yau

of finiteness of the class of consistent and physically viable line bundle
models constructed on this manifold. Further, for a specific semi-realistic

space of non-Abelian bundles, both by means of constructing specific polystable
non-Abelian bundles and by turning on VEVs in the associated low-energy theory.
In this context, we explore the fate of the Higgs doublets as we move in bundle
moduli space. The non-Abelian compactifications thus constructed lead to SU(5)
GUT models with an additional global B-L symmetry. The non-Abelian
compactifications inherit many of the appealing phenomenological features of
the Abelian model, such as the absence of dimension four and dimension five

Here the changes in edge density and plasma energy associated with those ELMs

second (longer) timescale is associated with a reduction in MHD energy that is
consistent with a resistive relaxation of the plasma's edge. The statistical

Surprisingly the commonly reported link between ELM energy (E) and ELM
frequency (f), of E proportional to 1/f, is not found. Instead beyond the first

point sources. We applied these criteria to the whole area of M31 as scanned by

90%, but the efficiency is different for the different groups of PNe
candidates.

  Decoherence and State Mixing","38 pages, 6 figures, typos corrected",,,,"quant-ph nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The famous Nils Bohr's quantum-classical correspondence principle states that
the classical mechanics is a limiting case of the more general quantum
mechanics. This implies that ``under certain conditions"" quantum laws of motion
become equivalent to classical laws. One of the conditions is fairly obvious:
the corresponding classical action should be very large as compared with the
Planck's constant. But this condition is not sufficient. Suppression of effects
of quantum interference (""decoherence"") is the phenomenon of primary importance
for understanding of the Bohr's principle. Being, in essence, of quite general
nature, this problem takes on special significance in the case of non-linear
classically chaotic quantum systems. Whereas the rapid decay of phase
correlations is an underlying feature of the classical dynamical chaos, the
""quantum chaos"" by itself is not capable of destroying the quantum phase
coherence. Strictly speaking, any initially pure quantum state remains pure
during an arbitrary long unitary evolution. Basically, formation of incoherent
mixed states (decoherence) results only from the process of preparation of a
mixed initial state or interaction with a noisy environment. Just the
decoherence brigdes the quantum and classical worlds.
  Peculiarities of the time behavior of Peres fidelity, state purity, Shanon
and von Neumann entropies are analyzed in detail. We demonstrate the ways the
decoherence shows up in periodically driven systems that can be associated with
Ramsey-type interferomentry experiments with ion traps. Finally, decoherence in
ballistic electron quantum transport caused by interaction with a disordered
environment is considered.

magnitude smaller than the values previously reported and also those predicted
by the model of deuterium depletion onto PAHs. Since the subtraction of the
ionized gas emission introduces an uncertainty, the deuterated PAH features are
also searched for in the reflection nebula GN 18.14.0, which does not show
emission lines from ionized gas. We obtain a similar result that excess

the pulsar magnetic field. We compare the large number of recent torque

strong-field solution is more compelling, in which case these pulsars are near
spin equilibrium. Our results provide evidence for a fundamental link between
pulsars with the slowest spin periods and strong magnetic fields around
high-mass companions and pulsars with the fastest spin periods and weak fields
around low-mass companions. The strong magnetic fields also connect our pulsars
to magnetars and strong-field isolated radio/X-ray pulsars. The strong field

if either the potential is not smooth enough, or if the energy is too close to
a stationary point of the potential (separatrix in the phase space). Very fast
changes in a time dependent system quite generally can be well described by
such a picture and by the approximation of a parametric kick, if the change of

line intensity, indicating that the formation of OH+ in the Bar is rapid enough
to influence its excitation. Our best-fit OH+ column density of ~1x10^14 cm^-2
is similar to that in previous absorption line studies, while our limits on the
ratios of OH+/H2O+ (>~40) and OH+/H3O+ (>~15) are higher than seen before.
  The column density of OH+ is consistent with estimates from a thermo-chemical
model for parameters applicable to the Orion Bar, given the current
uncertainties in the local gas pressure and the spectral shape of the ionizing
radiation field. The unusually high OH+/H2O+ and OH+/H3O+ ratios are probably
due to the high UV radiation field and electron density in this object. In the
Bar, photodissociation and electron recombination are more effective destroyers
of OH+ than the reaction with H2, which limits the production of H2O+. The
appearance of the OH+ lines in emission is the result of the high density of
electrons and H atoms in the Orion Bar, since for these species, inelastic
collisions with OH+ are faster than reactive ones. In addition, chemical
pumping, far-infrared pumping by local dust, and near-UV pumping by Trapezium
starlight contribute to the OH+ excitation. Similar conditions may apply to
extragalactic nuclei where OH+ lines are seen in emission.

separation of the quasar light from the stellar continuum and the
quasar-excited gas from the star-forming regions. To this end, we present a
novel technique for image decomposition and subtraction of quasar light. Our
primary result is the detection of extended line-emitting regions with sizes
ranging from 0.5 to 5 kpc and distributed symmetrically around the nucleus,
powered primarily by star formation. We determine star-formation rates of order
a few tens of M$_\odot$/yr. The host galaxies of our target quasars have
stellar masses of order $10^{11}$ M$_\odot$ and specific star formation rates
on a par with those of M82 and luminous infrared galaxies. As such they fall at
the upper envelope or just above the star-formation mass sequence in the
specific star formation vs stellar mass diagram. We see a clear trend of
increasing star formation rate with quasar luminosity, reinforcing the link
between the growth of the stellar mass of the host and the black hole mass
found by other authors.

To introduce polarizability in a straight-forward way one strategy is based on
Drude particles: dummy atoms whose displacements mimic polarizability. In this
work, molecular dynamics simulations of SWM4-NDP, a Drude-based water model,
were performed for a wide range of temperatures going from 170 K to 340 K. We
found that the density maximum is located far down in the supercooled region at
around 200 K, roughly 80 K below the experimental value. Very long relaxation
times together with a new increase in the density were found at even lower
temperatures. On the other hand, both hydrogen-bond coordination up to the
second solvation shell and tetrahedral order resembled very much what was found
for TIP4P/2005, a very good performer at the reproduction of the density curve
and other properties of bulk water in temperature space. Such a discrepancy
between the density curve and the hydrogen bond propensity was not observed in
other conventional water models. Our results suggest that while the simplicity
of the SWM4 model is appealing, its current parametrization needs improvements
in order to correctly reproduce water behavior beyond ambient conditions.

plasticity in a col- loidal polycrystal, following the evolution of the network
of grain boundaries as the sample is submitted to thousands of shear
deformation cycles. The grain boundary motion is found to be ballistic, with a
velocity distribution function exhibiting non-trivial power law tails. The
shear- induced dynamics initially slow down, similarly to the aging of the
spontaneous dynamics in glassy materials, but eventually reach a steady state.
Surprisingly, the cross-over time between the ini- tial aging regime and the
steady state decreases with increasing probed length scale, hinting at a
hierarchical organization of the grain boundary dynamics.

particular, we test the photospheric model proposed by Ryde and Pe'er (2009),
i.e., blackbody plus power--law, the addition of a blackbody emission to the
Band function in the cases in which this function does not fit the data, and
the Comptonization model developed by Titarchuk et al. (2012). By considering
the few spectra for which the simple Band function does not provide a fully
acceptable fit to the data (Frontera et al. 2012), only in one case we find a
statistically significant better fit by adding a blackbody to this function. We
confirm the results found fitting the BATSE spectra alone with a blackbody plus
a power law. Instead when the BATSE GRB spectra are joined to those obtained
with WFCs (2--28 keV), this model becomes unacceptable in most of time
intervals in which we subdivide the GRB light curves. We find instead that the
Comptonization model is always acceptable, even in the few cases in which the
Band function is inconsistent with the data. We discuss the implications of
these results.

univariate Lipschitz class with smoothness $\alpha > 0$ (including infinite
smoothness), and the ridge direction $a$ has $p$-norm $\|a\|_p \leq 1$. First,
we investigate entropy numbers in order to quantify the compactness of these
ridge function classes in $L_{\infty}$. We show that they are essentially as
compact as the class of univariate Lipschitz functions. Second, we examine
sampling numbers and face two extreme cases. In case $p=2$, sampling ridge
functions on the Euclidean unit ball faces the curse of dimensionality. It is
thus as difficult as sampling general multivariate Lipschitz functions, a
result in sharp contrast to the result on entropy numbers. When we additionally
assume that all feasible profiles have a first derivative uniformly bounded
away from zero in the origin, then the complexity of sampling ridge functions
reduces drastically to the complexity of sampling univariate Lipschitz
functions. In between, the sampling problem's degree of difficulty varies,
depending on the values of $\alpha$ and $p$. Surprisingly, we see almost the
entire hierarchy of tractability levels as introduced in the recent monographs

results and good approximation schemes for the time evolution of the electron
flow from a no-current state to a final stationary current state in a planar
one-dimensional diode. The electrons can be injected externally or generated by
the cathode via field emission governed by a current-field law. The case of
equipotential electrodes and fixed injection is studied along with a positive
anode potential. When the current is fixed externally the approach to the
stationary state goes without oscillations if the initial electron velocity is
high enough and the anode can absorb the injected flow. Otherwise the
accumulated space charge creates a potential barrier which reflects the flow
and leads to its oscillations, but our method of analysis is invalid in such
conditions. In the field emission case the flow goes to its stationary state
through a train of decaying oscillations whose period is of the order of the
electron transit time, in agreement with earlier studies based on perturbation
techniques. Our approximate method does not permit very high cathode
emissivity, though the method works when the stationary current density is only
about 10% smaller than the Child-Langmuir limit.

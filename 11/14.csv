simulations of motile microorganisms, modelled as prolate spheroids, in
isotropic homogeneous turbulence. We show that the clustering and patchiness
observed in laminar flows, linear shear and vortex flows, are significantly
reduced in a three-dimensional turbulent flow mainly because of the complex
topology; elongated micro-orgamisms show some level of clustering in the case
of swimmers without any preferential alignment whereas spherical swimmers
remain uniformly distributed. Micro-organisms with one preferential swimming
direction (e.g. gyrotaxis) still show significant clustering if spherical in
shape, whereas prolate swimmers remain more uniformly distributed. Due to their
large sensitivity to the local shear, these elongated swimmers react slower to
the action of vorticity and gravity and therefore do not have time to
accumulate in a turbulent flow. These results show how purely hydrodynamic
effects can alter the ecology of microorganisms that can vary their shape and
their preferential orientation.

Master's Thesis",,,,"physics.data-an q-bio.QM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  Fast and accurate protein structure prediction is one of the major challenges
in structural biology, biotechnology and molecular biomedicine. These fields
require 3D protein structures for rational design of proteins with improved or
novel properties. X-ray crystallography is the most common approach even with
its low success rate, but lately NMR based approaches have gained popularity.
The general approach involves a set of distance restraints used to guide a
structure prediction, but simple NMR triple-resonance experiments often provide
enough structural information to predict the structure of small proteins.
Previous protein folding simulations that have utilised experimental data have
weighted the experimental data and physical force field terms more or less
arbitrarily, and the method is thus not generally applicable to new proteins.
Furthermore a complete and near error-free assignment of chemical shifts
obtained by the NMR experiments is needed, due to the static, or deterministic,
assignment. In this thesis I present Chemshift, a module for handling chemical
shift assignments, implemented in the protein structure determination program
Phaistos. This module treats both the assignment of experimental data, as well
as the weighing compared to physical terms, in a probabilistic framework where
no data is discarded. Provided a partial assignment of NMR peaks, the module is
able to improve the assignment with the intension to utilise this in the
protein folding with little bias.

episode and the physics of pulsar wind nebulae in general. Aims. We search for
variability of the emission of the Crab Nebula at very-high energies (VHE; E >

telescopes. Methods. Observational data taken with the H.E.S.S. instrument on
five consecutive days during the flare were analysed concerning the flux and
spectral shape of the emission from the Crab Nebula. Night-wise light curves
are presented with energy thresholds of 1 TeV and 5 TeV. Results. The
observations conducted with H.E.S.S. on 2013 March 6 to March 10 show no
significant changes in the flux. They limit the variation on the integral flux
above 1 TeV to less than 63% and the integral flux above 5 TeV to less than 78%

always make progress in a finite number of steps. Yet programmers prefer to
treat concurrent code as if it were wait-free, guaranteeing that all operations
always make progress. Unfortunately, designing wait-free algorithms is
generally a very complex task, and the resulting algorithms are not always
efficient. While obtaining efficient wait-free algorithms has been a long-time
goal for the theory community, most non-blocking commercial code is only
lock-free.
  This paper suggests a simple solution to this problem. We show that, for a
large class of lock- free algorithms, under scheduling conditions which
approximate those found in commercial hardware architectures, lock-free
algorithms behave as if they are wait-free. In other words, programmers can
keep on designing simple lock-free algorithms instead of complex wait-free
ones, and in practice, they will get wait-free progress.
  Our main contribution is a new way of analyzing a general class of lock-free
algorithms under a stochastic scheduler. Our analysis relates the individual
performance of processes with the global performance of the system using Markov
chain lifting between a complex per-process chain and a simpler system progress
chain. We show that lock-free algorithms are not only wait-free with
probability 1, but that in fact a general subset of lock-free algorithms can be
closely bounded in terms of the average number of steps required until an
operation completes.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to analyze progress
conditions, typically stated in relation to a worst case adversary, in a
stochastic model capturing their expected asymptotic behavior.

quantum phase slips (QPS), has attracted a significant attention. It has been
shown that the phenomenon is capable to suppress zero resistivity of
ultra-narrow superconducting nanowires at low temperatures T<<Tc and quench
persistent currents in tiny nanorings. It has been predicted that a
superconducting nanowire in the regime of QPS is dual to a Josephson junction.
In particular case of an extremely narrow superconducting nanowire embedded in
high-impedance environment the duality leads to an intuitively controversial
result: the superconductor enters an insulating state. Here we experimentally
demonstrate that the I-V characteristic of such a wire indeed shows Coulomb
blockade, which disappears with application of critical magnetic field and/or
above the critical temperature proving that the effect is related to
superconductivity. The system can be considered as the dynamic equivalent of a
chain of conventional Josephson junctions.

CSRm (the main Cooler Storage Ring) at HIRFL (Heavy Ion Research Facility in
Lanzhou), which is expected to improve the performance of HIRFL. The linac
injector can supply heavy ion with maximum mass to charge ratio of 7 and
injection kinetic energy of 7.272MeV/u for CSRm, and the pulsed beam intensity
is 3emA with the duty factor of 3%. Compared with the present cyclotron
injector SFC (Sector Focusing Cyclotron), the beam current from linac can be
improved by 10-100 times. As the pre-accelerator of the linac, the 108.48MHz
4-rod RFQ accelerates ion beam from 4keV/u to 300keV/u, which achieves the
transmission efficiency of 95.3% with 3.07m long vanes. The phase advance has
been taken into account to analysis the error tolerance, and parametric
resonance have been carefully avoided by adjusting the structure parameters.
KONUS IH-DTLs, which follow the RFQ, accelerate the ions up to the energy of
7.272MeV/u and inject into HIRFL-CSRm. The resonance frequency is 108.48MHz for
the first two cavities and 216.96MHz for the last 5 DTLs. The maximum
accelerating gradient can reach 4.95MV/m in DTL section with the length of
17.066m, and the total pulsed RF power is 2.8MW. A new strategy, for the
determination of resonance frequency, RFQ vane voltage and DTL effective
accelerating voltage, is described in detail. The beam dynamics design of the
linac will be present in this paper.

permeability $K(\omega)$ of two-phase composites from data at different

representation of $K(\omega)$ derived by Avellaneda and Tortquato in
\cite{avellaneda1991rigorous-link-b}, which is valid for all pore space
geometry. The integral representation formula (IRF) for dynamic tortuosity is
derived and its analytic structure exploited for reconstructing the function
from a finite data set. All information of pore-space microstructure is
contained in the measure of the IRF. The theory of multipoint Pad\'{e}
approximates for Stieltjes functions guarantees the existence of relaxation
kernels that can approximate the dynamic permeability function and the dynamic
tortuosity function with high accuracy. In this paper, a numerical algorithm is
proposed for computing the relaxation time and the corresponding strength for
each element in the relaxation kernels; in the frequency domain, the
approximation can be regarded as approximating the Stieltjes function by
rational functions with simple poles and positive residues. With the idea from
dehomogenization, we also established the exact relations between the moments
of the positive measures in the IRFs of permeability and tortuosity with two
important parameters in the theory of poroelasticity: the infinite-frequency
tortuosity $\alpha_\infty$ for general case and the weighted volume-to-surface
ratio $\Lambda$ for the JKD model. From these relations, we suggest a new way
for evaluating these two microstructure-dependent parameters from a finite data
set of permeability and given values of porosity $\phi$ and pore fluid kinetic
viscosity $\nu$. Numerical results for JKD permeability and tortuosity are

study the case that the cavity photon field is circularly polarized and compare
it to the linearly polarized case. The quantum device is moreover coupled to
external, electrically biased leads. The time propagation in the transient
regime is described by a non-Markovian generalized master equation. We find
that the spin polarization and spin photocurrents of the quantum ring are
largest for circularly polarized photon field and destructive Aharonov-Casher
(AC) phase interference. The charge current suppression dip due to the
destructive AC phase becomes threefold under the circularly polarized photon
field as the interaction of the electrons' angular momentum and spin angular
momentum of light causes many-body level splitting leading to three many-body
level crossing locations instead of one. The circular charge current inside the
ring, which is induced by the circularly polarized photon field, is found to be
suppressed in a much wider range around the destructive AC phase than the
lead-device-lead charge current. The charge current can be directed through one
of the two ring arms with the help of the circularly polarized photon field,
but is superimposed by vortices of smaller scale. Unlike the charge
photocurrent, the flow direction of the spin photocurrent is found to be
independent of the handedness of the circularly polarized photon field.

immunological components (i. e. silencing a vertex) and see how it diverges

are then compared to real molecular knock-outs. To infer from these processing
we apply a new implementation of a random walk algorithm for directed graphs,
which ultimately generate statistical quantities provided by the dynamical
behaviour of the simulated KO's. It was observed that the a specifics KO caused
the greatest impact on network standard flux. In a brief analysis, the results

engineering process, several approaches with several techniques were developed.
One of these approaches is called separated approach. It requires separating
the commonalities and variability for system components to allow configuration
selection based on user defined features. Textual notation-based approaches
have been used for their formal syntax and semantics to represent system
features and implementations. But these approaches are still weak in mixing
features (conceptual level) and classes (physical level) that guarantee smooth
and automatic configuration generation for software releases. The absence of
methodology supporting the mixing process is a real weakness. In this paper, we
enhanced SPL reuse by introducing some meta-features, classified according to
their functions. As a first consequence, mixing class and feature concepts is
supported in a simple way using class interfaces and inherent features for
smooth move from feature model to class model. And as a second consequence, the
mixing process is supported by a textual design and implementation methodology,
mixing class and feature models by combining their concepts in a single
language. The supported configuration generation process is simple, coherent,
and complete.

  structures",,,"10.1103/PhysRevA.89.023829",,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A quasimodal expansion method (QMEM) is developed to model and understand the
scattering properties of arbitrary shaped two-dimensional (2-D) open
structures. In contrast with the bounded case which have only discrete spectrum
(real in the lossless media case), open resonators show a continuous spectrum
composed of radiation modes and may also be characterized by resonances
associated to complex eigenvalues (quasimodes). The use of a complex change of
coordinates to build Perfectly Matched Layers (PMLs) allows the numerical
computation of those quasimodes and of approximate radiation modes.
Unfortunately, the transformed operator at stake is no longer self-adjoint, and
classical modal expansion fails. To cope with this issue, we consider an
adjoint eigenvalue problem which eigenvectors are bi-orthogonal to the
eigenvectors of the initial problem. The scattered field is expanded on this
complete set of modes leading to a reduced order model of the initial problem.
The different contributions of the eigenmodes to the scattered field
unambiguously appears through the modal coefficients, allowing us to analyze
how a given mode is excited when changing incidence parameters. This gives new
physical insights to the spectral properties of different open structures such
as nanoparticles and diffraction gratings. Moreover, the QMEM proves to be
extremely efficient for the computation of Local Density Of States (LDOS).

  magnetic models of M dwarfs","Submitted to the Astrophysical Journal",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Precision modeling of M dwarfs has become worthwhile in recent years due to
the increasingly precise values of masses and radii which can be obtained from
eclipsing binary studies. Torres (2013) has identified 4 prime M dwarf pairs
with the most precise empirical determinations of masses and radii. The
measured radii are consistently larger than standard stellar models predict. We
have previously modeled M dwarfs in the context of a criterion due to Gough &
Tayler in which magnetic fields inhibit the onset of convection according to a
physics-based prescription. New constraints on the models of M dwarfs are now
provided by measurements of lithium abundances. The key aspect of Li in terms
of setting constraints on magnetic modeling is that Li burning starts at T =
2.5 MK, and temperatures of just such magnitude are associated with the base of
the convection zone: magnetic inhibition of convective onset can shift this
base slightly closer to the surface, i.e. to slightly lower temperatures,
thereby reducing the amount of Li depletion compared to a non-magnetic model.
In the present paper, we consider how our magneto-convection models handle the
new test of stellar structure provided by Li measurements. Among the prime
systems listed by Torres, we find that plausible magnetic models work well for
CM Dra and YY Gem but not for CU Cnc. (The fourth system in Torres's list does
not yet have enough information to warrant magnetic modeling.) For CU Cnc, we
suggest that the observed lithium may have been accreted from a circumstellar
disk. We find that our magneto-convection models of CM Dra, YY Gem and CU Cnc
yield results which are consistent with the observed correlation between
magnetic flux and X-ray luminosity.

of ovarian follicles increases with species size, with some ovarian follicles
reaching diameters more than 1000-fold the size of the enclosed oocyte. Here we
show that the different follicular sizes can be explained with diffusion-based
limitations on the thickness of the hormone-secreting granulosa layer. By
analysing published data on human follicular growth and granulosa cell
expansion during follicular maturation we find that the 4-fold increase of the
antral follicle diameter is entirely driven by an increase in the follicular
fluid volume, while the thickness of the surrounding granulosa layer remains
constant at about 45+/-10 mkm. Based on the measured kinetic constants, the
model reveals that the observed fall in the gonadotropin concentration from
peripheral blood circulation to the follicular antrum is a result of
sequestration in the granulosa. The model further shows that as a result of
sequestration, an increased granulosa thickness cannot substantially increase
estradiol production but rather deprives the oocyte from gonadotropins. Larger
animals (with a larger blood volume) require more estradiol as produced by the
ovaries to downregulate FSH-secretion in the pituitary. Larger follicle
diameters result in larger follicle surface areas for constant granulosa layer
thickness. The reported increase in follicular surface area in larger species
indeed correlates linearly both with species mass and with the predicted
increase in estradiol output. In summary, we propose a structural role for the
antrum in that it determines the volume of the granulosa layer and thus the
level of estrogen production.

with Neptune). The DES search fields are well documented, enabling us to
calculate the probability of detecting objects with particular orbital
parameters and absolute magnitudes at a randomized point in each orbit.
Grouping objects together by dynamical class leads, we estimate the orbital
element distributions (a, e, i) for the largest three classes (Classical, 3:2,
and Scattered) using maximum likelihood. Using H-magnitude as a proxy for the
object size, we fit a power law to the number of objects for 8 classes with at
least 5 detected members (246 objects). The best Classical slope is
alpha=1.02+/-0.01 (observed from 5<=H<=7.2). Six dynamical classes (Scattered
plus 5 resonances) are consistent in slope with the Classicals, though the
absolute number of objects is scaled. The exception to the power law relation
are the Centaurs (non-resonant with perihelia closer than Neptune, and thus
detectable at smaller sizes), with alpha=0.42+/-0.02 (7.5<H<11). This is
consistent with a knee in the H-distribution around H=7.2 as reported elsewhere
(Bernstein et al. 2004, Fraser et al. 2014). Based on the Classical-derived
magnitude distribution, the total number of objects (H<=7) in each class are:

estimate for the number of Centaurs in the same H range is 13+/-5. If instead
all objects are divided by inclination into ""Hot"" and ""Cold"" populations,

vertices, where each vertex $v$ of $G$ is replaced by $k$ vertices
$v_1,\cdots{},v_k$ and each edge $(u,v)$ in $G$ is replaced by a matching
representing a bijection $\pi_{uv}$ so that the edges of $H$ are of the form
$(u_i,v_{\pi_{uv}(i)})$. Lifts have been studied as a means to efficiently
construct expanders. In this work, we study lifts obtained from groups and
group actions. We derive the spectrum of such lifts via the representation
theory principles of the underlying group. Our main results are:
  (1) There is a constant $c_1$ such that for every $k\geq 2^{c_1nd}$, there
does not exist an abelian $k$-lift $H$ of any $n$-vertex $d$-regular base graph
with $H$ being almost Ramanujan (nontrivial eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix
at most $O(\sqrt{d})$ in magnitude). This can be viewed as an analogue of the
well-known no-expansion result for abelian Cayley graphs.
  (2) A uniform random lift in a cyclic group of order $k$ of any $n$-vertex
$d$-regular base graph $G$, with the nontrivial eigenvalues of the adjacency
matrix of $G$ bounded by $\lambda$ in magnitude, has the new nontrivial
eigenvalues also bounded by $\lambda+O(\sqrt{d})$ in magnitude with probability
$1-ke^{-\Omega(n/d^2)}$. In particular, there is a constant $c_2$ such that for
every $k\leq 2^{c_2n/d^2}$, there exists a lift $H$ of every Ramanujan graph in
a cyclic group of order $k$ with $H$ being almost Ramanujan. We use this to
design a quasi-polynomial time algorithm to construct almost Ramanujan
expanders deterministically.
  The existence of expanding lifts in cyclic groups of order $k=2^{O(n/d^2)}$
can be viewed as a lower bound on the order $k_0$ of the largest abelian group
that produces expanding lifts. Our results show that the lower bound matches
the upper bound for $k_0$ (upto $d^3$ in the exponent).

differential equations (PDE) to denoise one-dimensional signals through the
image processing of time-frequency representations, such as the spectrogram. In
this image denoising algorithms, the particularity of the image was hardly
taken into account. We turn, in this paper, to study the performance of
non-local filters, like Neighborhood or Yaroslavsky filters, in the same
problem. We show that, for certain iterative schemes involving the Neighborhood
filter, the computational time is drastically reduced with respect to
Yaroslavsky or nonlinear PDE based filters, while the outputs of the filtering
processes are similar. This is heuristically justified by the connection
between the (fast) Neighborhood filter applied to a spectrogram and the
corresponding Nonlocal Means filter (accurate) applied to the Wigner-Ville
distribution of the signal. This correspondence holds only for time-frequency
representations of one-dimensional signals, not to usual images, and in this
sense the particularity of the image is exploited. We compare though a series
of experiments on synthetic and biomedical signals the performance of local and
non-local filters.

of loop quantum gravity on a fixed graph. The main tool we use is the
parametrisation of the theory in terms of twistors, which has already proved
useful in discussing the interpretation of spin networks as the quantization of
twisted geometries. The classical formalism can be extended in a natural way to
null hypersurfaces, with the Euclidean polyhedra replaced by null polyhedra
with space-like faces, and SU(2) by the little group ISO(2). The main
difference is that the simplicity constraints present in the formalims are all
first class, and the symplectic reduction selects only the helicity subgroup of
the little group. As a consequence, information on the shapes of the polyhedra
is lost, and the result is a much simpler, abelian geometric picture. It can be
described by an Euclidean singular structure on the 2-dimensional space-like
surface defined by a foliation of space-time by null hypersurfaces. This
geometric structure is naturally decomposed into a conformal metric and scale
factors, forming locally conjugate pairs. Proper action-angle variables on the
gauge-invariant phase space are described by the eigenvectors of the Laplacian
of the dual graph. We also identify the variables of the phase space amenable
to characterize the extrinsic geometry of the foliation. Finally, we quantise
the phase space and its algebra using Dirac's algorithm, obtaining a notion of
spin networks for null hypersurfaces. Such spin networks are labelled by SO(2)
quantum numbers, and are embedded non-trivially in the unitary,
infinite-dimensional irreducible representations of the Lorentz group.

propose a kernel method for learning multi-view latent variable models,

is to embed the joint distribution of a multi-view latent variable into a
reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and then the latent parameters are recovered
using a robust tensor power method. We establish that the sample complexity for
the proposed method is quadratic in the number of latent components and is a
low order polynomial in the other relevant parameters. Thus, our non-parametric

computational efficiencies. Moreover, the non-parametric tensor power method
compares favorably to EM algorithm and other existing spectral algorithms in

this end, we develop the equations of motion for this system within a

configurational disorder is characterized by the compactivity $X = \partial V /

significantly lowering the flow stress at large strain rates, if the material
is rate-strengthening in character. We show in addition that if the granular

density ($P^2SAD$) in galactic haloes, introduced recently as a novel measure
of the clustering of dark matter. Our model is based on the stable clustering
hypothesis in phase space, the spherical collapse model, and tidal disruption
of substructures, which is calibrated against the Aquarius simulations. Using
this model, we can predict the behaviour of $P^2SAD$ in the numerically
unresolved regime, down to the decoupling mass limit of generic WIMP models.
This prediction can be used to estimate signals sensitive to the small scale
structure of dark matter. For example, the dark matter annihilation rate can be
estimated for arbitrary velocity-dependent cross sections in a convenient way
using a limit of $P^2SAD$ to zero separation in physical space. We illustrate
our method by computing the global and local subhalo annihilation boost to that
of the smooth dark matter distribution in a Milky-Way-size halo. Two cases are
considered, one where the cross section is velocity independent and one that
approximates Sommerfeld-enhanced models. We find that the global boost is
$\sim10-30$, which is at the low end of current estimates (weakening
expectations of large extragalactic signals), while the boost at the solar
radius is below the percent level. We make our code to compute $P^2SAD$
publicly available, which can be used to estimate various observables that
probe the nanostructure of dark matter haloes.

interactions. The dominant particle-hole instability is found to be an
incommensurate, bi-directional, bond density wave with wavevectors along the
(1,1) and (1,-1) directions, and an internal d-wave symmetry. The magnitude of
the ordering wavevector is close to the separation between points on the Fermi
surface which intersect the antiferromagnetic Brillouin zone boundary. The
temperature dependence of the superconducting and bond order parameters
demonstrates their mutual competition. We also obtain the spatial dependence of
the two orders in a vortex lattice induced by an applied magnetic field:
""halos"" of the bond order appear around the cores of the vortices.

pyrochlore XY antiferromagnet, we study the problem of quantum
order-by-disorder in pyrochlore XY systems. We consider the most general
nearest-neighbor pseudo spin-1/2 Hamiltonian for such a system characterized by
anisotropic spin-spin couplings J_e = [J_\pm, J_{\pm\pm}, J_{z\pm}, J_{zz}] and
construct zero-temperature phase diagrams. Combining symmetry arguments and
spin-wave calculations, we show that the ground state phase boundaries between
the two candidate ground states of the \Gamma_5 irreducible representation, the
\psi_2 and \psi_3 (basis) states, are rather accurately determined by a cubic
equation in J_{\pm}J_{\pm\pm})/J_{z\pm}^2. Depending on the value of J_{zz},
there can be one or three phase boundaries that separate alternating regions of
\psi_2 and \psi_3 states. In particular, we find for sufficiently small
J_{zz}/J_{\pm} a narrow \psi_2 sliver sandwiched between two \psi_3 regions in
the J_{\pm\pm}/J_\pm vs J_{z\pm}/J_\pm phase diagram. Our results further
illustrate the very large potential sensitivity of the ground state of XY
pyrochlore systems to minute changes in their spin Hamiltonian. Using the
experimentally determined J_3 and g-tensor values for Er2Ti2O7, we show that
the heretofore neglected long-range 1/r^3 magnetostatic dipole-dipole
interactions do not change the conclusion that Er2Ti2O7 has a \psi_2 ground
state induced via a quantum order-by-disorder mechanism. We propose that the
CdDy2Se4 chalcogenide spinel, in which the Dy^{3+} ions form a pyrochlore
lattice and may be XY-like, could prove interesting to investigate.

Lorenzian six-manifold with a product structure, $M_6=C \times M_4 $. This is
done by an investigation of the free tensor multiplet on the level of equations
of motion, where the problem of its formulation in Euclidean signature is
circumvented by letting the time-like direction lie in the two-manifold $C$ and
performing a topological twist along $M_4$ alone. A compactification on $C$ is
shown to be necessary to enable the possibility of finding a topological field
theory. The hypothetical twist along a Euclidean $C$ is argued to amount to the
correct choice of linear combination of the two supercharges scalar on $M_4$.
This procedure is expected and conjectured to result in a topological field
theory, but we arrive at the surprising conclusion that this twisted theory
contains no $Q$-exact and covariantly conserved stress tensor unless $M_4$ has
vanishing curvature. This is to our knowledge a phenomenon which has not been
observed before in topological field theories. In the literature, the setup of
the twisting used here has been suggested as the origin of the conjectured
AGT-correspondence, and our hope is that this work may somehow contribute to
the understanding of it.

examine the spatial distribution of dark matter contained within voids
identified in galaxy surveys, we apply Halo Occupation Distribution models
representing sparsely and densely sampled galaxy surveys to a high-resolution
N-body simulation. We compare these galaxy voids to voids found in the halo
distribution, low-resolution dark matter, and high-resolution dark matter. We
find that voids at all scales in densely sampled surveys - and medium- to
large-scale voids in sparse surveys - trace the same underdensities as dark
matter, but they are larger in radius by ~20%, they have somewhat shallower
density profiles, and they have centers offset by ~0.4Rv rms. However, in
void-to-void comparison we find that shape estimators are less robust to
sampling, and the largest voids in sparsely sampled surveys suffer
fragmentation at their edges. We find that voids in galaxy surveys always
correspond to underdensities in the dark matter, though the centers may be
offset. When this offset is taken into account, we recover almost identical
radial density profiles between galaxies and dark matter. All mock catalogs

can be explained by a high concentration of stellar remnants at the cluster
center. This paper shows that, from a technical point of view and with current
computing power, spatial binning of data is no longer necessary. This not only
leads to more accurate fits, but also avoids biased mass estimates due to the
loss of resolution. Furthermore, we find that the mass concentration in M15 is

to unbiased and objective selection criteria, easily reproducible in
simulations, as well as a comparison sample of, otherwise similar, gamma-ray -
quiet blazars. As such, the results of this survey are appropriate for both
phenomenological population studies and for tests of theoretical population

magnitude of 17 and as low as $0.035$ down to 18 magnitude. The hypothesis that
the polarization fractions of gamma-ray - loud and gamma-ray - quiet blazars
are drawn from the same distribution is rejected at the $10^{-3}$ level. We
therefore conclude that gamma-ray - loud and gamma-ray - quiet sources have
different optical polarization properties. This is the first time this

fraction distributions of both samples are well-described by exponential
distributions with averages of $\langle p \rangle =6.4 ^{+0.9}_{-0.8}\times

primary interactions with ordinary matter are through the Higgs portal. We
consider both the cases when the decays of an on-shell Higgs into a pair of
hidden sector particles are kinematically allowed, and the case when such
decays are kinematically forbidden. We find that at collider energies below a
TeV, the most sensitive channel involves production of an on-shell or off-shell
Higgs in association with a Z boson, and the subsequent decay of the Higgs into
invisible hidden sector states. Focusing on this channel, we find that with
order a thousand inverse fb of data at 250 GeV, the decay branching fraction of
an on-shell Higgs to invisible hidden sector states can be constrained to lie
below half a percent. The corresponding limits on Higgs portal dark matter will
be stronger than the bounds from current and upcoming direct detection
experiments in much of parameter space. With the same amount of data at 500
GeV, assuming order one couplings, decays of an off-shell Higgs to hidden
sector states with a total mass up to about 200 GeV can also be probed. Both
the on-shell and off-shell cases represent a significant improvement in
sensitivity when compared to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

entanglement entropies from correlations using perturbation bounds, drawing
intuition from ideas of quantum information theory. This rigorous approach is
complemented by an intuitive understanding in terms of entanglement edge
states. These insights have a number of important consequences: The area law
has no universal component, no matter how small, and the entanglement scaling
cannot be used as a faithful diagnostic of topological insulators. This holds
for all Renyi entropies which uniquely determine the entanglement spectrum

entangled topological insulators furthermore opens up possibilities of devising
correlated topological phases in which the entanglement entropy is small and
which are thereby numerically tractable, specifically in tensor network

redshifts 0.9 < z < 1.6. Of these, 56 are quiescent with high signal-to-noise
absorption line spectra, enabling us to determine robust stellar velocity
dispersions for the largest sample yet available beyond a redshift of 1.
Together with effective radii measured from deep Hubble Space Telescope images,
we calculate dynamical masses and address key questions relating to the
puzzling size growth of quiescent galaxies over 0 < z < 2. We examine the
relationship between stellar and dynamical masses at high redshift, finding
that it closely follows that determined locally. We also confirm the utility of
the locally-established empirical calibration which enables high-redshift
velocity dispersions to be estimated photometrically, and we determine its
accuracy to be 35%. To address recent suggestions that progenitor bias - the
continued arrival of recently-quenched larger galaxies - can largely explain
the size evolution of quiescent galaxies, we examine the growth at fixed
velocity dispersion assuming this quantity is largely unaffected by the merger
history. We demonstrate that significant size and mass growth have clearly
occurred in individual systems. Parameterizing the relation between mass and
size growth over 0 < z < 1.6 as R \propto M^alpha, we find alpha = 1.6 +- 0.3,
in agreement with theoretical expectations from simulations of minor mergers.
Relaxing the assumption that the velocity dispersion is unchanging, we examine
growth assuming a constant ranking in galaxy velocity dispersion. This approach
is applicable only to the large-dispersion tail of the distribution, but yields
a consistent growth rate of alpha = 1.4 +- 0.2. Both methods confirm that
progenitor bias alone is insufficient to explain our new observations and that
quiescent galaxies have grown in both size and stellar mass over 0 < z < 1.6.

bag-of-words models have been well studied, they typically operate on low level
features and ultimately suffer from either scalability issues or a lack of
semantic meaning. On the other hand, video supervoxel segmentation has recently
been established and applied to large scale data processing, which potentially
serves as an intermediate representation to high level video semantic
extraction. The supervoxels are rich decompositions of the video content: they
capture object shape and motion well. However, it is not yet known if the
supervoxel segmentation retains the semantics of the underlying video content.
In this paper, we conduct a systematic study of how well the actor and action
semantics are retained in video supervoxel segmentation. Our study has human
observers watching supervoxel segmentation videos and trying to discriminate
both actor (human or animal) and action (one of eight everyday actions). We
gather and analyze a large set of 640 human perceptions over 96 videos in 3
different supervoxel scales. Furthermore, we conduct machine recognition
experiments on a feature defined on supervoxel segmentation, called supervoxel
shape context, which is inspired by the higher order processes in human
perception. Our ultimate findings suggest that a significant amount of
semantics have been well retained in the video supervoxel segmentation and can
be used for further video analysis.

length $\sqrt{2}+ \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}= 2.6389\ldots$. The current best lower
bound for the length of a (not necessarily connected) barrier is $2$, as
established by Jones about 50 years ago. No better lower bound is known even if
the barrier is restricted to lie in the square or in its close vicinity. Under
a suitable locality assumption, we replace this lower bound by $2+10^{-12}$,
which represents the first, albeit small, step in a long time toward finding
the length of the shortest barrier. A sharper bound is obtained for interior
barriers: the length of any interior barrier for the unit square is at least $2

by Sylvester for the measure of all lines that meet two disjoint planar convex

action appears as a result of spontaneous symmetry breaking when the conformal
compensator scalar field, the conformon, acquires a nonzero value, giving rise
to the Planck mass. After that, many symmetries of the original theory become
well hidden, and therefore they are often ignored. However, recent developments
demonstrated that superconformal invariance is more than just a tool: it plays
an important role in generalizing previously existing formulations of
supergravity and developing new classes of inflationary models. In this paper
we describe hidden superconformal symmetry of the cosmological evolution. In
this formulation, inflation can be equivalently described as the conformon
instability, and creation of the universe `from nothing' can be interpreted as
spontaneous symmetry breaking due to emergence of a classical conformon field.
We develop a general formalism that allows to describe the cosmological
evolution simultaneously with the evolution of the conformon. We find a set of
gauge invariant physical observables, including the superconformally invariant
generalizations of the square of the Weyl tensor, which are necessary for
invariant description of the cosmological singularities.

and M-theory is investigated. In this formalism the U-duality symmetry of
M-theory or T-duality symmetry of Type II string theory becomes manifest upon
extending coordinates that describe a background.
  The effective potential of Double Field Theory is formulated only up to a
boundary term and thus does not capture possible topological effects that may
come from a boundary. By introducing a generalised normal we derive a
manifestly duality covariant boundary term that reproduces the known
Gibbons-Hawking action of General Relativity, if the section condition is
imposed. It is shown that the full potential can be represented as a sum of the
scalar potential of gauged supergravity and a topological term that is a full
derivative. The latter is conjectured to capture non-trivial topological
information of the corresponding background, such as monodromy around an exotic
brane.
  Next we show that the Scherk-Schwarz reduction of M-theory extended geometry
successfully reproduces known structures of maximal gauged supergravities.
Local symmetries of the extended space defined by a generalised Lie derivatives
reduce to gauge transformations and lead to the embedding tensor written in
terms of twist matrices. The scalar potential of maximal gauged supergravity
that follows from the effective potential is shown to be duality invariant with
no need of section condition. Instead, this condition, that assures the closure
of the algebra of generalised diffeomorphisms, takes the form of the quadratic
constraints on the embedding tensor.

simplest frame pattern, called the $\mu$ pattern, in $n$-cycles. Given an
$n$-cycle $C$, we say that a pair $\langle i,j \rangle$ matches the $\mu$
pattern if $i < j$ and as we traverse around $C$ in a clockwise direction
starting at $i$ and ending at $j$, we never encounter a $k$ with $i < k < j$.
We say that $ \langle i,j \rangle$ is a nontrivial $\mu$-match if $i+1 < j$.
Also, an $n$-cycle $C$ is incontractible if there is no $i$ such that $i+1$
immediately follows $i$ in $C$.
  We show that the number of incontractible $n$-cycles in the symmetric group
$S_n$ is $D_{n-1}$, where $D_n$ is the number of derangements in $S_n$.
Further, we prove that the number of $n$-cycles in $S_n$ with exactly $k$
$\mu$-matches can be expressed as a linear combination of binomial coefficients
of the form $\binom{n-1}{i}$ where $i \leq 2k+1$. We also show that the
generating function $NTI_{n,\mu}(q)$ of $q$ raised to the number of nontrivial
$\mu$-matches in $C$ over all incontractible $n$-cycles in $S_n$ is a new
$q$-analogue of $D_{n-1}$, which is different from the $q$-analogues of the
derangement numbers that have been studied by Garsia and Remmel and by Wachs.
We show that there is a rather surprising connection between the charge
statistic on permutations due to Lascoux and Sch\""uzenberger and our
polynomials in that the coefficient of the smallest power of $q$ in
$NTI_{2k+1,\mu}(q)$ is the number of permutations in $S_{2k+1}$ whose charge
path is a Dyck path. Finally, we show that $NTI_{n,\mu}(q)|_{q^{\binom{n-1}{2}

and a tool to compare the description of quantum geometry in various approaches

smooth geometries but also on discrete (e.g., simplicial) ones. In this paper,
we consider the spectral dimension of quantum states of spatial geometry
defined on combinatorial complexes endowed with additional algebraic data: the
kinematical quantum states of loop quantum gravity (LQG). Preliminarily, the
effects of topology and discreteness of classical discrete geometries are
studied in a systematic manner. We look for states reproducing the spectral
dimension of a classical space in the appropriate regime. We also test the
hypothesis that in LQG, as in other approaches, there is a scale dependence of
the spectral dimension, which runs from the topological dimension at large
scales to a smaller one at short distances. While our results do not give any
strong support to this hypothesis, we can however pinpoint when the topological
dimension is reproduced by LQG quantum states. Overall, by exploring the
interplay of combinatorial, topological and geometrical effects, and by
considering various kinds of quantum states such as coherent states and their
superpositions, we find that the spectral dimension of discrete quantum
geometries is more sensitive to the underlying combinatorial structures than to
the details of the additional data associated with them.

turn used to estimate the level of astrophysical noise expected in radial

estimate RV noise for magnetically active stars, which we attribute to
variations in the phase and strength of the stellar magnetic cycle that drives
the activity of these targets. However, for stars we deem to be magnetically
quiet, we do find a clear correlation between photometric variability and
estimated levels of RV noise (with variability up to ~ 10 m/s). We conclude,
that for these quiet stars, we can use photometric measurements as a proxy to
estimate the RV noise expected. As a result, the procedure outlined in this

Diagnostic tools for the interpretation of the phases of massive star formation
and testing the evolutionary models are then developed. Evolutionary tracks
able to fit Herschel Space Telescope data require the generated stars to be
three to four times less massive than in previous interpretations, thus being
consistent with clump star formation efficiencies of $10 -- 15\%$. However, for
these cold Hershel clumps, the bolometric temperature is not a good diagnostic
to differentiate between accretion models. We also find that neither spherical
nor disk accretion can explain the high radio luminosities of many protostars.
Nevertheless, we discover a solution in which the extreme ultraviolet flux
needed to explain the radio emission is produced if the accretion flow is via
free-fall on to hot spots covering less than $10\%$ of the surface area.
Moreover, the protostar must be compact, and so has formed through cold
accretion. We show that these conclusions are independent of the imposed
accretion history. This suggests that massive stars form via gas accretion
through disks which, in the phase before the star bloats, download their mass
via magnetic flux tubes on to the protostar.

consistency by the mentioned observables. The issue of the assignment of those
nucleon states to the broken SU(4) x O(3) mixed-symmetry multiplet is studied

Accurate and reliable measurements of projected rotational velocities in large

using a large, high quality spectroscopic dataset, and a strategy which account
for other sources of broadening appart from rotation affecting the diagnostic
lines We present a versatile and user friendly IDL tool, based on a combined
Fourier Transform (FT) + goodness of fit (GOF) methodology, for the
line-broadening characterization in OB-type stars. We use this tool to (a)
investigate the impact of macroturbulent and microturbulent broadenings on
vsini measurements, and (b) determine vsini in a sample of 200 Galactic OB-type
stars, also characterizing the amount of macroturbulent broadening (\vmacro)
affecting the line profiles. We present observational evidence illustrating the
strengths and limitations of the proposed FT+GOF methodology for the case of OB
stars. We confirm previous statements (based on indirect arguments or smaller
samples) that the macroturbulent broadening is ubiquitous in the massive star
domain. We compare the newly derived vsini with previous determinations not
accounting for this extra line-broadening contribution, and show that those
cases with vsini< 120 km/s need to be systematically revised downwards by ~25
(+/-20) km/s. We suggest that microturbulence may impose an upper limit below

quantum mechanics. However, the non-determinism implied by the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle --- together with other prominent aspects of quantum
mechanics such as superposition, entanglement, and nonlocality --- poses deep
puzzles about the underlying physical reality, even while these same features
are at the heart of exciting developments such as quantum cryptography,
algorithms, and computing. These puzzles might be resolved if the mathematical
structure of quantum mechanics were built up from physically interpretable
axioms, but it is not. We propose three physically-based axioms which together
characterize the simplest quantum system, namely the qubit. Our starting point
is the class of all no-signaling theories. Each such theory can be regarded as
a family of empirical models, and we proceed to associate entropies, i.e.,
measures of information, with these models. To do this, we move to phase space
and impose the condition that entropies are real-valued. This requirement,
which we call the Information Reality Principle, arises because in order to
represent all no-signaling theories (including quantum mechanics itself) in
phase space, it is necessary to allow negative probabilities (Wigner [1932]).
Our second and third principles take two important features of quantum
mechanics and turn them into deliberately chosen physical axioms. One axiom is
an Uncertainty Principle, stated in terms of entropy. The other axiom is an
Unbiasedness Principle, which requires that whenever there is complete
certainty about the outcome of a measurement in one of three mutually
orthogonal directions, there must be maximal uncertainty about the outcomes in
each of the two other directions.

well-known results on the one-dimensional lattice. As a nontrivial model, we
apply this method to the dual Sierpinski gasket and obtain its exact, closed
system of RG-recursions. Numerical iteration suggests that under rescaling the
system length, $L^{\prime}=2L$, characteristic times rescale as
$t^{\prime}=2^{d_{w}}t$ with the exact walk exponent

invariance, this is very close to the ballistic spreading, $d_{w}=1$, found for
regular lattices. However, we argue that an extended interpretation of the
traditional RG formalism will be needed to obtain scaling exponents
analytically. Direct simulations confirm our RG-prediction for $d_w$ and
furthermore reveal an immensely rich phenomenology for the spreading of the
quantum walk on the gasket. Invariably, quantum interference localizes the walk
completely with a site-access probability that declines with a powerlaw from
the initial site, in contrast with a classical random walk, which would pass
all sites with certainty.

circularly polarised Stokes V profile has been obtained using Least-Squares
Deconvolution, and used to detect surface magnetic fields and measure the
corresponding mean surface longitudinal magnetic field ($B_{l}$). Chromospheric
activity indicators were also measured.
  Surface magnetic fields were detected for 67 stars, with 21 of these stars
classified as mature solar-type stars, a result that increases by a factor of
four the number of mature solar-type stars on which magnetic fields have been
observed. In addition, a magnetic field was detected for 3 out of 18 of the
subgiant stars surveyed. For the population of K-dwarfs the mean value of
$B_{l}$ ($|B_{l}|_{mean}$) was also found to be higher (5.7 G) than
$|B_{l}|_{mean}$ measured for the G-dwarfs (3.2 G) and the F-dwarfs (3.3 G).
For the sample as a whole $|B_{l}|_{mean}$ increases with rotation rate and
decreases with age, and the upper envelope for $|B_{l}|$ correlates well with
the observed chromospheric emission. Stars with a chromospheric S-index greater
than about 0.2 show a high magnetic field detection rate and so offer optimal
targets for future studies.
  This survey constitutes the most extensive spectropolarimetric survey of cool

interaction Hamiltonian that accounts for the position of the molecule within
the excitation beam to derive the effective differential scattering
cross-section of a classical LG beam from a molecule using the frequency domain
third order nonlinear optical response function. To gain physical insight into
this scattering process, we utilize a model vibronic molecule to study the
changes to this scattering process. For specific molecular parameters including
vibrational frequency and relative displacement of the involved electronic
states, this investigation shows that an incident LG beam asymmetrically
enhances one of two participating excitation transitions causing modulation of
the interference present in the scattering process. This modulation allows a
pathway to coherent control of resonant inelastic scattering from complex,
poly-atomic molecules. We discuss the possible application of this control to
the resonant x-ray inelastic scattering (RIXS) of small poly-atomic molecules

the factoring of an integer if a pair of its two squares representations is

diverges at points that are connected by null geodesics, and recovers the

experience single-keyhole conditions, the effect of spatial correlations

$M>N$ (i.e., the number of transmission antennas is greater than the number of
receiving antennas), depending on how the correlation matrix $\mathbf{P}$
beamforms the code word difference matrix $\mathbf{\Delta}$, the PEP
performance of general STCs can be either degraded or improved in high SNR

$\mathbf{\Delta}$ and the numbers of transmission and receiving antennas, to
exam if there exists certain correlation matrices that can improve the

Comments are welcome",,,,"cs.LO cs.FL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Probabilistic automata were introduced by Rabin in 1963 as language
acceptors. Two automata are equivalent if and only if they accept each word
with the same probability. On the other side, in the process algebra community,
probabilistic automata were re-proposed by Segala in 1995 which are more
general than Rabin's automata. Bisimulations have been proposed for Segala's
automata to characterize the equivalence between them. So far the two notions
of equivalences and their characteristics have been studied most independently.
In this paper, we consider Segala's automata, and propose a novel notion of
distribution based bisimulation by joining the existing equivalence and
bisimilarities. Our bisimulation bridges the two closely related concepts in
the community, and provides a uniform way of studying their characteristics. We
demonstrate the utility of our definition by studying distribution based
bisimulation metrics, which gives rise to a robust notion of equivalence for
Rabin's automata.

$\phi$. Three different regimes are identified as regular lattice (RL) for
$\phi\lesssim 2^{-12}$, SWN for $2^{-12}<\phi< 0.1$ and random network (RN) for
$\phi\ge 0.1$. In the RL regime, the sandpile dynamics is characterized by
usual Bak, Tang, Weisenfeld (BTW) type correlated scaling whereas in the RN
regime it is characterized by the mean field (MF) scaling. On SWN, both the
scaling behaviors are found to coexist. Small compact avalanches below certain
characteristic size $s_c$ are found to belong to the BTW universality class
whereas large, sparse avalanches above $s_c$ are found to belong to the MF
universality class. A scaling theory for the coexistence of two scaling forms
on SWN is developed and numerically verified. Though finite size scaling (FSS)
is not valid for DSM on RL as well as on SWN, it is found to be valid on RN for
the same model. FSS on RN is appeared to be an outcome of super diffusive sand

breaking leads to the generation of two independent condensates, the
conventional chiral condensate and a spin-one condensate. While the chiral
condensate generates a dynamical fermion mass, the new condensate gives rise to
a dynamical anomalous magnetic moment for the fermions. As a consequence, the
spectrum of the excitations in all Landau levels, except the lowest one,
exhibits Zeeman splitting. Since the pair, formed by a quark and an antiquark
with opposite spins, possesses a resultant magnetic moment, an external
magnetic field can align it giving rise to a net magnetic moment for the ground
state. This is the physical interpretation of the spin-one condensate. Our
results show that the magnetically catalyzed ground state in QCD is actually
richer than previously thought. The two condensates contribute to the effective
mass of the LLL quasiparticles in such a way that the critical temperature for
chiral symmetry restoration becomes enhanced.

about the structure of optimal transport plans for costs that are concave

existence of an optimal map comes from the possible singularity of the cost at
$0$, everything is quite easy if the supports of the two measures are disjoint;
Gangbo and McCann proved the result under the assumption $\mu(\spt(\nu))=0$; in
this paper we replace this assumption with the fact that the two measures are
singular to each other. In this case it is possible to prove the existence of
an optimal transport map, provided the starting measure $\mu$ does not give
mass to small sets (i.e. $(d\!-\!1)-$rectifiable sets). When the measures are
not singular the optimal transport plan decomposes into two parts, one
concentrated on the diagonal and the other being a transport map between

However, finding such classical codes that lead to promising quantum

there are two families of classical codes that are proved to produce quantum

against misalignment, their code lengths have been restricted to primes and
Mersenne numbers. In this paper, examining the incidence vectors of projective

symmetric galaxies. The model covers a wide range of galaxies from a disk
system to an elliptical galaxy by suitably choosing the dynamical parameters.
We study the regular and chaotic character of orbits in the model and try to
connect the degree of chaos with the parameter describing the deviation of the
system from axial symmetry. In order to obtain this, we use the Smaller
ALingment Index (SALI) technique by numerically integrating the basic equations
of motion, as well as the variational equations for extensive samples of
orbits. Our results suggest, that the influence of the deviation parameter on
the portion of chaotic orbits strongly depends on the vertical distance $z$
from the galactic plane of the orbits. Using different sets of initial
conditions, we show that the chaotic motion is dominant in galaxy models with
low values of $z$, while in the case of stars with large values of $z$ the
regular motion is more abundant, both in elliptical and disk galaxy models.

processors. While such assumptions often hold for engineered networks, e.g.,
due to underlying error correction protocols, their relevance to biological
systems, wherein messages are often distorted before reaching their
destination, is quite limited. In this study we take a first step towards
reducing this gap by rigorously analyzing a model of communication in large
anonymous populations composed of simple agents which interact through short
and highly unreliable messages.
  We focus on the broadcast problem and the majority-consensus problem. Both
are fundamental information dissemination problems in distributed computing, in
which the goal of agents is to converge to some prescribed desired opinion. We
initiate the study of these problems in the presence of communication noise.
Our model for communication is extremely weak and follows the push gossip
communication paradigm: In each round each agent that wishes to send
information delivers a message to a random anonymous agent. This communication
is further restricted to contain only one bit (essentially representing an
opinion). Lastly, the system is assumed to be so noisy that the bit in each
message sent is flipped independently with probability $1/2-\epsilon$, for some
small $\epsilon >0$.
  Even in this severely restricted, stochastic and noisy setting we give
natural protocols that solve the noisy broadcast and the noisy
majority-consensus problems efficiently. Our protocols run in $O(\log n /
\epsilon^2)$ rounds and use $O(n \log n / \epsilon^2)$ messages/bits in total,
where $n$ is the number of agents. These bounds are asymptotically optimal and,
in fact, are as fast and message efficient as if each agent would have been
simultaneously informed directly by an agent that knows the prescribed desired
opinion.

to study the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) phase diagram. The main goals are to
search for the possible phase boundary, softening of equation of state or first
order phase transition, and possible critical point. Phase-I of the BES program
has recently concluded with data collection for Au+Au collisions at
center-of-mass energies ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}$) of 7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, and 39 GeV.
Several interesting results are observed for these lower energies where the
net-baryon density is high at the mid-rapidity. These results indicate that the
matter formed at lower energies (7.7 and 11.5 GeV) is hadron dominated and
might not have undergone a phase transition. In addition, the centrality
dependence of freeze-out parameters is observed for the first time at lower
energies, slope of directed flow for (net)-protons measured versus rapidity
shows an interesting behavior at lower energies, and higher moments of
net-proton show deviation from Skellam expectations at lower energies. An
outlook for the future BES Phase-II program is presented and efforts for the
detailed study of QCD phase diagram are discussed.

remain in their native Fortran), utilising the object-oriented features of the
language, and improving the modularity of the code. Pre-written scripts are
provided for running the simulations in `standard' modes of operation, but the
code is flexible enough to support the writing of personalised scripts. The
modular structure also makes the addition of experimental features (such as new
models for period or luminosity distributions) more straightforward than with
the previous code.
  We also discuss potential additions to the modelling capabilities of the
software. Finally, we demonstrate some potential applications of the code;
first, using results of surveys at different observing frequencies, we find
pulsar spectral indices are best fit by a normal distribution with mean $-1.4$
and standard deviation $1.0$. Second, we model pulsar spin evolution to
calculate the best-fit for a relationship between a pulsar's luminosity and
spin parameters. We used the code to replicate the analysis of
Faucher-Gigu\`ere & Kaspi, and have subsequently optimized their power-law
dependence of radio luminosity, $L$, with period, $P$, and period derivative,
$\dot{P}$. We find that the underlying population is best described by $L
\propto P^{-1.39 \pm 0.09} \dot{P}^{0.48 \pm 0.04}$ and is very similar to that
found for $\gamma$-ray pulsars by Perera et al. Using this relationship, we
generate a model population and examine the age-luminosity relation for the
entire pulsar population, which may be measurable after future large-scale
surveys with the Square Kilometer Array.

sources, including 35 VLBI images of the methanol maser. Since two independent
sources were found in three images, respectively, images of 38 sources were

observed spatial scale of the maser distribution was from 9 to 4900

elliptical, arched, linear, paired, and complex. The position of the maser spot
was determined to an accuracy of approximately 0.1 mas, sufficiently high to
measure the internal proper motion from two years of monitoring observations.
The VLBI observation, however, detected only approximately 20% of all maser

high-resolution observations, it is important to observe the whole structure of

interactions in field theories. The programme does not involve perturbation
theories and associated problems of divergences. We apply our recent idea of
treating strongly interacting liquids to field theories by showing the
equivalence of Hamiltonians of liquids and interacting fields. In this
approach, the motion of the field results in the disappearance of $n-1$
transverse modes with frequency smaller than the Frenkel frequency $\omega_{\rm
F}$, similar to the loss of two transverse modes in a liquid with frequency
$\omega<\omega_{\rm F}$. We illustrate the proposed programme with the
calculation of the energy and propagator, and show that the results can not be
obtained in perturbation theory to any finite order. Importantly, the Frenkel
energy gap $E_{\rm F}=\hbar\omega_{\rm F}$ and the associated massive Frenkel
particle naturally appear in our consideration, the result that is relevant for
current efforts to demonstrate a mass gap in interacting field theories such as
Yang-Mills theory. Notably, our mechanism involves a physically sensible
starting point in terms of real masses (frequencies) in the harmonic
non-interacting field, in contrast to the Higgs effect involving the imaginary
mass as a starting point. We further note that the longitudinal mode in our
approach remains gapless, implying that both short-range and long-range forces
with massive and massless particles naturally emerge and unify in a single
interacting field, a result not hitherto anticipated. Finally, we comment on
the relationship between our results and hydrodynamic description of the
quark-gluon plasma.

proposed infrared modification of the Einstein equations, based on the
introduction of a non-local term constructed with $m^2g_{\mu\nu}\Box^{-1} R$,
where $m$ is a mass parameter. The theory generates automatically a dynamical
dark energy component, that can reproduce the observed value of the dark energy
density without introducing a cosmological constant. Fixing $m$ so to reproduce
the observed value $\Omega_{\rm DE}\simeq 0.68$, and writing $w(a)=w_0+(1-a)
w_a$, the model provides a neat prediction for the equation of state parameters
of dark energy, $w_0\simeq -1.042$ and $w_a\simeq -0.020$. We show that,
because of some freedom in the definition of $\Box^{-1}$, one can extend the
construction so to define a more general family of non-local models. However,
in a first approximation this turns out to be equivalent to adding an explicit
cosmological constant term on top of the dynamical dark energy component. This
leads to an extended model with two parameters, $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ and $m$.
Even in this extension the EOS parameter $w_0$ is always on the phantom side,
in the range $-1.33 < w_0\leq -1$, and there is a prediction for the relation
between $w_0$ and $w_a$.

composition of the present-day interstellar medium (ISM) and of our solar

used the APEX telescope to detect thermal SiO isotopologue emission toward four
oxygen-rich M-type stars. Together with the data retrieved from the Herschel
science archive and from the literature, we were able to obtain the 29Si/30Si
ratios for a total of 15 evolved stars inferred from their optically thin 29SiO
and 30SiO emission. These stars cover a range of masses and ages, and because
they do not significantly alter 29Si/30Si during their lifetimes, they provide
excellent probes of the ISM metallicity (or 29Si/30Si ratio) as a function of
time. The 29Si/30Si ratios inferred from the thermal SiO emission tend to be
lower toward low-mass oxygen-rich stars (e.g., down to about unity for W Hya),
and close to an interstellar or solar value of 1.5 for the higher-mass carbon
star IRC+10216 and two red supergiants. There is a tentative correlation
between the 29Si/30Si ratios and the mass-loss rates of evolved stars, where we
take the mass-loss rate as a proxy for the initial stellar mass or current
stellar age. This is consistent with the different abundance ratios found in
presolar grains. We found that older objects (up to possibly 10 Gyr old) in our
sample trace a previous, lower 29Si/30Si value of about 1. Material with this
isotopic ratio is present in two subclasses of presolar grains, providing
independent evidence of the lower ratio. Therefore, the 29Si/30Si ratio derived
from the SiO emission of evolved stars is a useful diagnostic tool for the
study of the GCE and presolar grains.

retarding force created by its disturbance of the surrounding medium. In a
previous contribution (Lee & Stahler 2011), we determined this dynamical
friction force when the object's velocity was subsonic. We now extend our
analysis to the supersonic regime. As before, we consider small perturbations
created in the gas far from the gravitating object, and thereby obtain the net
influx of linear momentum over a large, bounding surface. Various terms in the
perturbation series formally diverge, necessitating an approximate treatment of
the flow streamlines. Nevertheless, we are able to derive exactly the force
itself. As in the subsonic case, we find that F=Mdot*V, where Mdot is the rate
of mass accretion onto the object and V its instantaneous velocity with respect
to distant background gas. Our force law holds even when the object is porous

force in the supersonic regime is less than that derived analytically by
previous researchers, and is also less than was found in numerical simulations
through the mid 1990s. We urge simulators to revisit the problem using modern
numerical techniques. Assuming our result to be correct, it is applicable to
many fields of astrophysics, ranging from exoplanet studies to galactic

this situation the related Grothendieck quantale corresponds to a
hypergroupoid. Relatively simple finiteness conditions on this hypergroupoid
appear in order to obtain an interesting C* algebra. This algebra corresponds
to a hypergroupoid algebra which comes endowed with an arithmetic sub-algebra
and a time evolution. We conclude by showing that the existence of a
hypergroupoid satisfying all the requirements attached to a specified atomic
topos is equivalent to the fact that the topos is locally decidable and locally
separated. Also in this situation the time evolution only depends on the topos
and is described by a (canonical) principal Q+* bundle on the topos. The
BC-system and more generally the double cosets algebras are special cases of
this situation.

H0 = 72.5 +/- 2.5 km/s/Mpc, which differs by 1.9 sigma from the Planck value.

non-local entangling unitary operation. This is desirable for when attempting
to scale up or distribute quantum computation by combining fixed static local
sets of qubits with ballistic mediators. Using a model driven by measurements
on the ancilla, it is possible to generate a maximally entangling CZ gate while
only having access to a less entangling gate between the pair qubits and the
ancilla. However this results in a stochastic process of generating control
phase rotation gates where the expected time for success does not correlate
with the entangling power of the connection gate. We explore how one can use
feedback into the preparation and measurement parameters of the ancilla to
speed up the expected time to generate a CZ gate between a pair of separated
qubits and to leverage stronger coupling strengths for faster times.
Surprisingly, by choosing an appropriate strategy, control of a binary discrete
parameter achieves comparable speed up to full continuous control of all
degrees of freedom of the ancilla.

revise their beliefs, or change their behavior as a result of social
interactions with other people. In our strongly interconnected society, social
influence plays a prominent role in many self-organized phenomena such as
herding in cultural markets, the spread of ideas and innovations, and the
amplification of fears during epidemics. Yet, the mechanisms of opinion
formation remain poorly understood, and existing physics-based models lack
systematic empirical validation. Here, we report two controlled experiments
showing how participants answering factual questions revise their initial
judgments after being exposed to the opinion and confidence level of others.
Based on the observation of 59 experimental subjects exposed to peer-opinion
for 15 different items, we draw an influence map that describes the strength of
peer influence during interactions. A simple process model derived from our
observations demonstrates how opinions in a group of interacting people can
converge or split over repeated interactions. In particular, we identify two
major attractors of opinion: (i) the expert effect, induced by the presence of
a highly confident individual in the group, and (ii) the majority effect,
caused by the presence of a critical mass of laypeople sharing similar
opinions. Additional simulations reveal the existence of a tipping point at
which one attractor will dominate over the other, driving collective opinion in
a given direction. These findings have implications for understanding the
mechanisms of public opinion formation and managing conflicting situations in
which self-confident and better informed minorities challenge the views of a
large uninformed majority.

degrades the performance and reliability of Mobile Adhoc Networks. In MANETs,
nodes have dual responsibilities of forwarding and routing, that's why it needs
unison with nodes. To sort out non-cooperation a real life behavior should be
implemented, so that misbehavior is nullified. In this paper, we present the
""Mirror Model"" that strictly enforces cooperation due to its punishment
strategy. Node's behavior is watched by its neighbors in PON mode, to update
the NPF, NPRF values for a threshold time. After the expiry of the threshold
time each node calculates the PFR and broadcasts its neighbors. Similarly all
neighbors broadcasted PFR is received and processed by the node to define the
'G' and 'BP' values. The G value is used to isolate selfish nodes from the
routing paths and BP denotes the amount of packets to be dropped by an honest
node against a selfish node in spite of its misbehavior/packet drops.
Cooperation within the neighbors, certainly result in subsiding misbehavior of
selfish nodes, therein enhancing cooperation of the whole MANET. This model
ensures honesty and reliability in MANET because it does not eliminate a node,
but it behaves in the same way as the node behaved. Therefore, it justifies its
name, after all mirrors reflects the same. We have implemented the model in
""GloMoSim"" on top of the DSR protocol, resulting its effectiveness, as compared
to the DSR protocol when the network is misconducting for its selfish needs.

on how they interact with the training data. These include memory and
sequential access constraints (e.g. fast first-order methods to solve
stochastic optimization problems); communication constraints (e.g. distributed
learning); partial access to the underlying data (e.g. missing features and
multi-armed bandits) and more. However, currently we have little understanding
how such information constraints fundamentally affect our performance,
independent of the learning problem semantics. For example, are there learning
problems where any algorithm which has small memory footprint (or can use any
bounded number of bits from each example, or has certain communication
constraints) will perform worse than what is possible without such constraints?
In this paper, we describe how a single set of results implies positive answers
to the above, for several different settings.

  experiment","7+7 pages, 3+1 figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Why do correlations between the results of measurements performed on physical
systems violate Bell and non-contextuality inequalities up to some specific
limits? The answer may follow from the observation that in quantum theory,
unlike in other theories, whenever there is an experiment to measure $A$
simultaneously with $B$, another to measure $B$ with $C$, and another to
measure $A$ with $C$, there is always an experiment to measure all of them
simultaneously. This property implies that quantum theory satisfies a seemingly
irrelevant restriction called the exclusivity (E) principle which,
surprisingly, explains the set of quantum correlations in some fundamental
scenarios. An open problem is whether the E principle explains the maximum
quantum violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality. Here we show experimentally that
the E principle imposes an upper bound to the violation of the Bell-CHSH
inequality that matches the maximum predicted by quantum theory. For that, we
use the result of an independent experiment testing a specific
non-contextuality inequality. We perform both experiments: the Bell-CHSH
inequality experiment on polarization entangled states of pairs of photons in
Stockholm and, to demonstrate independence, the non-contextuality inequality
experiment on single photons' orbital angular momentum states in Rome. The
observed results provide the first experimental evidence that the E principle
determines the limits of quantum correlations and prove that hypothetical
super-quantum violations for either experiment would violate the E principle.
This supports the conclusion that the E principle captures a fundamental
limitation of nature. If this is true, much of quantum theory trivially follow
from merely taking the E principle to be a fundamental truth, and various
information-theoretic postulates are also simplified and/or strengthened.

modeled via numerical dust coagulation codes. In this approach, physical
effects that dominate the dust growth process often must be implemented in a
parameterized form. Due to a lack of these parameterizations, existing studies
of dust coagulation have ignored the effects a hydrodynamical gas flow can have
on grain growth, even though it is often argued that the flow could
significantly contribute either positively or negatively to the growth process.
  Aims. We intend to provide a quantification of hydrodynamical effects on the
growth of dust particles, such that these effects can be parameterized and
implemented in a dust coagulation code.
  Methods. We numerically integrate the trajectories of small dust particles in
the flow of disk gas around a proto-planetesimal, sampling a large parameter
space in proto-planetesimal radii, headwind velocities, and dust stopping
times.
  Results. The gas flow deflects most particles away from the
proto-planetesimal, such that its effective collisional cross section, and
therefore the mass accretion rate, is reduced. The gas flow however also
reduces the impact velocity of small dust particles onto a proto-planetesimal.
This can be beneficial for its growth, since large impact velocities are known
to lead to erosion. We also demonstrate why such a gas flow does not return
collisional debris to the surface of a proto-planetesimal.
  Conclusions. We predict that a laminar hydrodynamical flow around a
proto-planetesimal will have a significant effect on its growth. However, we
cannot easily predict which result, the reduction of the impact velocity or the
sweep-up cross section, will be more important. Therefore, we provide
parameterizations ready for implementation into a dust coagulation code.

the G16.59-0.05 high-mass star-forming region, where previous studies have
established the presence of two almost perpendicular (NE-SW and SE-NW), massive
outflows, and a rotating disk traced by methanol maser emission. We performed
Very Large Array observations of the radio continuum and ammonia line emission,
complemented by COMICS/Subaru and Hi-GAL/Herschel images in the mid- and
far-infrared (IR). Our centimeter continuum maps reveal a collimated radio jet
that is oriented E-W and centered on the methanol maser disk, placed at the SE
border of a compact molecular core. The spectral index of the jet is negative,
indicating non-thermal emission over most of the jet, except the peak close to
the maser disk, where thermal free-free emission is observed. We find that the
ammonia emission presents a bipolar structure consistent (on a smaller scale)
in direction and velocity with that of the NE-SW bipolar outflow detected in
previous CO observations. After analyzing our previous N2H+(1-0) observations
again, we conclude that two scenarios are possible. In one case both the radio
jet and the ammonia emission would trace the root of the large-scale CO bipolar
outflow. The different orientation of the jet and the ammonia flow could be
explained by precession and/or a non-isotropic density distribution around the
star. In the other case, the N2H+(1-0) and ammonia bipolarity is interpreted as
two overlapping clumps moving with different velocities along the line of
sight. The ammonia gas also seems to undergo rotation consistent with the maser
disk. Our IR images complemented by archival data allow us to derive a
bolometric luminosity of about 10^4 L_sun and to conclude that most of the
luminosity is due to the young stellar object associated with the maser disk.

has recently been found to exhibit a very proportional response. We predict
band gaps for NaI and SrI$_2$ of 5.5 and 5.2 eV, respectively, in good
agreement with experiment. Furthermore, we obtain binding energies for the
groundstate excitons of 216 meV for NaI and 195$\pm$25 meV for SrI$_2$. We
analyze the degree of exciton anisotropy and spatial extent by means of a
coarse-grained electron-hole pair-correlation function. Thereby, it is shown
that the excitons in NaI differ strongly from those in SrI$_2$ in terms of
structure and symmetry, even if their binding energies are similar.
Furthermore, we show that quite unexpectedly the spatial extents of the highly

distribution follows the electric field gradient (EFG) spatial modulation
(wave) - EFGW. The EFGW is accompanied by some charge density wave (CDW) having
about an order of magnitude lesser influence on the spectrum. The EFGW could be
modeled as widely separated narrow sheets with the EFG increasing from small

small and almost constant EFG between sheets. The EFGW shape and amplitude as

recover at a temperature being about 14 K lower. The maximum quadrupole

  A number of network generation models have been proposed in the last decade

  A simple, collisionless, charged gas is described by a distribution function
which is defined on the mass shell and satisfies the Liouville equation.
Suitable fibre integrals of the distribution function define observable fields
on the spacetime manifold, such as the current density and stress-energy
tensor. Finally, the geometric setting of this work allows us to discuss the
relationship between the symmetries of the electromagnetic field, those of the
spacetime metric, and the symmetries of the distribution function. Taking
advantage of these symmetries, we construct the most general solution of the
Liouville equation an a Kerr-Newman black hole background.

localized nature of such events above atmospheric pressure, the long drift
times, as well as the possibility to determine their production time from the

attachment coefficients. In this work we focus on the little explored
combination of Xe and trimethylamine (TMA) for which, in particular, such

over pure Xenon when aimed at Rare Event Searches, mainly due to its Penning
characteristics, wave-length shifting properties and reduced diffusion, and it
is being actively investigated by our collaboration. The chamber is currently
operated at 2.7 bar, as an intermediate step towards the envisaged 10 bar. We
report here its performance as well as a first implementation of the

of quantum information tasks and resources taking into account the relativistic
aspects of nature. More precisely, it is of fundamental interest to understand
how the storage, manipulation, and transmission of information utilizing
quantum systems are influenced by the fact that these processes take place in a
relativistic spacetime. In particular, many studies in RQI have been focused on
the effects of non-uniform motion on entanglement, the main resource of quantum
information protocols. Early investigations in this direction were performed in
highly idealized settings that prompted questions as to the practical
accessibility of these results. To overcome these limitations it is necessary
to consider quantum systems that are in principle accessible to localized
observers. In this thesis we present such a model, the rigid relativistic
cavity, and its extensions, focusing on the effects of motion on entanglement
and applications such as quantum teleportation. We study cavities in (1+1)
dimensions undergoing non-uniform motion, consisting of segments of uniform
acceleration and inertial motion of arbitrary duration that allow the involved
velocities to become relativistic. The transitions between segments can be
sharp or smooth and higher dimensions can be incorporated. The primary focus
lies in the Bogoliubov transformations of the quantum fields, real scalar
fields or Dirac fields, confined to the cavities. The Bogoliubov
transformations change the particle content and the occupation of the energy
levels of the cavity. We show how these effects generate entanglement between
the modes of the quantum fields inside a single cavity for various initial
states. The entanglement between several cavities, on the other hand, is
degraded by the non-uniform motion, influencing the fidelity of tasks such as
teleportation.

space missions (CoRoT, Kepler and SoHO) in which the interpretation of the data
in terms of Fourier frequencies becomes difficult. We emphasize the necessity
of a new interpretation of the stellar light curves in order to identify the
correct frequencies of the pulsation modes.

On the one hand, due to their quasi-one-dimensional nature, they can act as a
experimental testbed for exotic physics: Peierls instability, charge density
waves, and Luttinger liquid behavior. On the other hand, due to their small
size, they are of interest for future device applications in the
micro-electronics industry, but also for applications regarding molecular
electronics. This versatile nature makes them interesting systems to produce
and study, but their size and growth conditions push both experimental
production and theoretical modeling to their limits. In this review, modeling
of atomic scale nanowires on semiconductor surfaces is discussed focusing on
the interplay between theory and experiment. The current state of modeling
efforts on Pt- and Au-induced nanowires on Ge(001) is presented, indicating
their similarities and differences. Recently discovered nanowire systems (Ir,
Co, Sr) on the Ge(001) surface are also touched upon. The importance of
scanning tunneling microscopy as a tool for direct comparison of theoretical
and experimental data is shown, as is the power of density functional theory as
an atomistic simulation approach. It becomes clear that complementary strengths
of theoretical and experimental investigations are required for successful
modeling of the atomistic nanowires, due to their complexity.

regular data taken with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA). The edge-on
galaxy, UGC 10288, has been observed in the B, C, and D configurations at
L-band (1.5 GHz) and in the C and D configurations at C-band (6 GHz) in all
polarization products. We show the first spatially resolved images in these
bands,the first polarization images, and the first composed image at an
intermediate frequency (4.1 GHz) which has been formed from a combination of
all data sets.
  A surprising new result is the presence of a strong, polarized, double-lobed
extragalactic radio source ({\it CHANG-ES A}) almost immediately behind the
galaxy and perpendicular to its disk. The core of {\it CHANG-ES A} has an
optical counterpart at a photometric redshift of $z_{phot}\,=\,0.39$; the
southern radio lobe is behind the disk of UGC 10288 and the northern lobe is
behind the halo region. This background `probe' has allowed us to do a
preliminary Faraday Rotation analysis of the foreground galaxy, putting limits
on the regular magnetic field and electron density in the halo of UGC 10288 in
regions in which there is no direct detection of a radio continuum halo.
  We have revised the flux densities of the two sources individually as well as
the star formation rate (SFR) for UGC 10288. UGC 10288 would have fallen well
below the CHANG-ES flux density cutoff, had it been considered without the
brighter contribution of the background source.
  UGC 10288 shows discrete high-latitude radio continuum features, but it does
not have a {\it global} radio continuum halo. The total minimum magnetic field
strength at a sample position in the arc is $\sim$ 10 $\mu$G. Thus, this galaxy
still appears to be able to form substantial high latitude, localized features
in spite of its relatively low SFR.

a version control system, which is a program tracking the history of files and
helping importing modifications brought by others as patches. The
implementation of such a system requires to handle lots of situations depending
on the operations performed by users on files, and it is thus difficult to
ensure that all the corner cases have been correctly addressed. Here, instead
of verifying the implementation of such a system, we adopt a complementary
approach: we introduce a theoretical model, which is defined abstractly by the
universal property that it should satisfy, and work out a concrete description
of it. We begin by defining a category of files and patches, where the
operation of merging the effect of two coinitial patches is defined by pushout.
Since two patches can be incompatible, such a pushout does not necessarily
exist in the category, which raises the question of which is the correct
category to represent and manipulate files in conflicting state. We provide an
answer by investigating the free completion of the category of files under
finite colimits, and give an explicit description of this category: its objects
are finite sets labeled by lines equipped with a transitive relation and
morphisms are partial functions respecting labeling and relations.

Prandtl-Reuss relations of infinitesimal elasto-plasticity to finite strains.
In this work, some basic approaches are compared in a qualitative way with
respect to a certain invariance property. These basic approaches include the
additive hypoelasto-plasticity with corotational stress rates, additive
plasticity in the logarithmic strain space, and multiplicative
hyperelasto-plasticity.
  The notion of weak invariance is introduced in this study. Roughly speaking,
a material model is weakly invariant under a certain transformation of the
local reference configuration if this reference change can be neutralized by a
suitable transformation of initial conditions, leaving the remaining
constitutive relations intact. We analyse the basic models in order to find out
if they are weakly invariant under arbitrary volume-preserving transformations
of the reference configuration.
  It is shown that the weak invariance property corresponds to a generalized
symmetry which provides insights into underlying constitutive assumptions. This
property can be used for a systematic study of different frameworks of finite
strain elasto-plasticity. In particular, it can be used as a classification
criterion.

Power Graph Analysis offers an alternate way to draw a graph in which sets of
nodes with common neighbours are shown grouped into modules. An edge connected
to the module then implies a connection to each member of the module. Thus, the
entire graph may be represented with much less clutter and without loss of
detail. A recent experimental study has shown that such lossless compression of
dense graphs makes it easier to follow paths. However, computing optimal power
graphs is difficult. In this paper, we show that computing the optimal
power-graph with only one module is NP-hard and therefore likely NP-hard in the
general case. We give an ILP model for power graph computation and discuss why
ILP and CP techniques are poorly suited to the problem. Instead, we are able to
find optimal solutions much more quickly using a custom search method. We also
show how to restrict this type of search to allow only limited back-tracking to
provide a heuristic that has better speed and better results than previously
known heuristics.

like dialectics are measured quantitatively. For that, a corpus of paintings of

features is extracted and the features which most contributed to the
classification of painters are selected. The projection space obtained provides
the basis to the analysis of measurements. This quantitative measures underlie
revealing observations about the evolution of painting styles, specially when
compared with other humanity fields already analyzed: while music evolved along
a master-apprentice tradition (high dialectics) and philosophy by opposition,
painting presents another pattern: constant increasing skewness, low opposition
between members of the same movement and opposition peaks in the transition
between movements. Differences between baroque and modern movements are also
observed in the projected ""painting space"": while baroque paintings are
presented as an overlapped cluster, the modern paintings present minor
overlapping and are disposed more widely in the projection than the baroque
counterparts. This finding suggests that baroque painters shared aesthetics
while modern painters tend to ""break rules"" and develop their own style.

making it possible to bridge the gap between hard sciences and humanities. In
this study, we propose an approach based on a quantitative evaluation of
attributes of objects in fields of humanities, from which concepts such as
dialectics and opposition are formally defined mathematically. As case studies,
we analyzed the temporal evolution of classical music and philosophy by
obtaining data for 8 features characterizing the corresponding fields for 7
well-known composers and philosophers, which were treated with multivariate
statistics and pattern recognition methods. A bootstrap method was applied to
avoid statistical bias caused by the small sample data set, with which hundreds
of artificial composers and philosophers were generated, influenced by the 7
names originally chosen. Upon defining indices for opposition, skewness and
counter-dialectics, we confirmed the intuitive analysis of historians in that
classical music evolved according to a master-apprentice tradition, while in
philosophy changes were driven by opposition. Though these case studies were
meant only to show the possibility of treating phenomena in humanities
quantitatively, including a quantitative measure of concepts such as dialectics
and opposition the results are encouraging for further application of the
approach presented here to many other areas, since it is entirely generic.

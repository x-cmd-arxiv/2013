multinomial logistic (softmax) regression. We treat counts for each response
category as independent Poisson regressions via plug-in estimates for fixed
effects shared across categories. The work is driven by the
high-dimensional-response multinomial models that are used in analysis of a
large number of random counts. Our motivating applications are in text
analysis, where documents are tokenized and the token counts are modeled as
arising from a multinomial dependent upon document attributes. We estimate such
models for a publicly available data set of reviews from Yelp, with text
regressed onto a large set of explanatory variables (user, business, and rating
information). The fitted models serve as a basis for exploring the connection
between words and variables of interest, for reducing dimension into supervised
factor scores, and for prediction. We argue that the approach herein provides
an attractive option for social scientists and other text analysts who wish to
bring familiar regression tools to bear on text data.

probe of the photo-pion production mechanism by UHE cosmic rays. Their
observation, or non-observation, may constrain astrophysical scenarios for the
origin of UHECRs and help to understand the nature of the flux suppression
observed by several experiments at energies above $10^{19.5}$ eV. Whereas the
interaction length of UHE photons above $10^{17}$ eV ranges from a few hundred
kpc up to tenths of Mpc, photons can interact with the extragalactic background
radiation initiating the development of electromagnetic cascades which affect
the fluxes of photons observed at Earth. The interpretation of the current
experimental results rely on the simulations of the UHE photon propagation. In
this paper, we present the novel Monte Carlo code EleCa to simulate the
$Ele$ctromagnetic $Ca$scading initiated by high-energy photons and electrons.
  We provide an estimation of the surviving probability for photons inducing
electromagnetic cascades as a function of their distance from the observer and
we calculate the distances within which we expect to observe UHE photons with
energy between $10^{17}$ and $10^{19}$ eV. Furthermore, the flux of GZK photons
at Earth is investigated in several astrophysical scenarios where we vary both
injection spectrum and composition at the source and the intensity of the
intervening extragalactic magnetic field. Although the photon propagation
depends on several astrophysical factors, our numerical predictions combined
with future experimental observations (or non-observations) of UHE photons --
in the energy range between $10^{17.5}$ eV and $10^{20}$ eV -- can help to
constrain these scenarios.

that the analytic continuation of the $S_Q$ symmetry yields logarithmic

mixing of some scaling fields by the scale transformation generator. All these

improved by the use of a formalism. However, there remains an open issue: to
what extent can a development process based on a singular formal notation and
method succeed. The majority of approaches demonstrate a low level of
flexibility by attempting to use a single notation to express all of the
different aspects encountered in software development. Often, these approaches
leave a number of scalability issues open. We prefer a more eclectic approach.
In our experience, the use of a formalism-based toolkit with adequate notations
for each development phase is a viable solution. Following this principle, any
specific notation is used only where and when it is really suitable and not
necessarily over the entire software lifecycle. The approach explored in this
article is perhaps slowly emerging in practice - we hope to accelerate its
adoption. However, the major challenge is still finding the best way to
instantiate it for each specific application scenario. In this work, we
describe a development process and method for automotive applications which
consists of five phases. The process recognizes the need for having adequate
(and tailored) notations (Problem Frames, Requirements State Machine Language,
and Event-B) for each development phase as well as direct traceability between
the documents produced during each phase. This allows for a stepwise
verification/validation of the system under development. The ideas for the
formal development method have evolved over two significant case studies
carried out in the DEPLOY project.

introduced as a tool to study properties of finite groups that can be expressed
in terms of commutators of elements of coprime orders. They are defined as
follows. Let $G$ be a finite group. Every element of $G$ is both a
$\gamma_1^*$-commutator and a $\delta_0^*$-commutator. Now let $j\geq 2$ and
let $X$ be the set of all elements of $G$ that are powers of
$\gamma_{j-1}^*$-commutators. An element $g$ is a $\gamma_j^*$-commutator if
there exist $a\in X$ and $b\in G$ such that $g=[a,b]$ and $(|a|,|b|)=1$. For
$j\geq 1$ let $Y$ be the set of all elements of $G$ that are powers of
$\delta_{j-1}^*$-commutators. The element $g$ is a $\delta_j^*$-commutator if
there exist $a,b\in Y$ such that $g=[a,b]$ and $(|a|,|b|)=1$. The subgroups of
$G$ generated by all $\gamma_j^*$-commutators and all $\delta_j^*$-commutators
are denoted by $\gamma_j^*(G)$ and $\delta_j^*(G)$, respectively. For every
$j\geq2$ the subgroup $\gamma_j^*(G)$ is precisely the last term of the lower
central series of $G$ (which throughout the paper is denoted by
$\gamma_\infty(G)$) while for every $j\geq1$ the subgroup $\delta_j^*(G)$ is
precisely the last term of the lower central series of $\delta_{j-1}^*(G)$,
that is, $\delta_j^*(G)=\gamma_\infty(\delta_{j-1}^*(G))$.
  In the present paper we prove that if $G$ possesses $m$ cyclic subgroups
whose union contains all $\gamma_j^*$-commutators of $G$, then $\gamma_j^*(G)$
contains a subgroup $\Delta$, of $m$-bounded order, which is normal in $G$ and
has the property that $\gamma_{j}^{*}(G)/\Delta$ is cyclic. If $j\geq2$ and $G$
possesses $m$ cyclic subgroups whose union contains all
$\delta_j^*$-commutators of $G$, then the order of $\delta_j^*(G)$ is
$m$-bounded.

relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We explore the principles governing the
hadronization of the expanding QGP fireball, and to understand its properties.
Much of the ongoing effort is to demonstrate the validity of a QGP
hadronization model which describes the particle production data accurately. We
begin with a centrality study of multistrange hadrons from Au-Au collisions at
62.4 GeV at RHIC. We show that the statistical hadronization model (SHM) well
describes particle production in QGP hadronization. For all centralities, the
physical properties are compatible with the earlier proposed critical
hadronization pressure suggesting universal hadronization conditions of QGP.
  Heavy-ion collisions at LHC present a new challenge for SHM in describing
particle production at TeV energy scales. We show that the chemical
non-equilibrium model gives a good description of the hadron production in
Pb--Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV consistently as a function of centrality.
Moreover, the model parameters assume expected values suggested by previous
studies at lower energies. The quark-gluon plasma fireball hadronizes at the
same universal hadronization conditions, that is a common critical pressure,
entropy and energy density.
  At LHC energies, a significant amount of charm is expected to be produced and
it is therefore crucial to incorporate charm into the present description of
particle production. We present an upgraded SHARE with CHARM program, that
quantifies the effect of charm on the yield of lighter hadrons and physical
properties of the hadronizing fireball. In addition to light flavors ($u,d,s$),
SHARE with CHARM describes charm hadron production and decays. We observe, that
according to present experimental results, charm decays mainly affect the
yields of multistrange particles.

organic matter (SOM) but this interaction is insufficiently understood at the
molecular level. We investigated the adsorption of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) on
soil samples with systematically modified SOM. These samples included the
original soil, the soil modified by adding a hot water extract (HWE) fraction
(soil+3 HWE and soil+6 HWE), and the pyrolyzed soil. The SOM contents increased
in the order pyrolyzed soil < original soil < soil+3 HWE < soil+6 HWE. For the
latter three samples this order was also valid for the HCB adsorption. The
pyrolyzed soil adsorbed more HCB than the other samples at low initial
concentrations, but at higher concentrations the HCB adsorption became weaker
than in the samples with HWE addition. This adsorption behaviour combined with
the differences in the chemical composition between the soil samples suggested
that alkylated aromatic, phenol, and lignin monomer compounds contributed most
to the HCB adsorption. To obtain a molecular level understanding, a test set
has been developed on the basis of elemental analysis which comprises 32
representative soil constituents. The calculated binding free energy for HCB
with each representative system shows that HCB binds to SOM stronger than to
soil minerals. For SOM, HCB binds to alkylated aromatic, phenols, lignin
monomers, and hydrophobic aliphatic compounds stronger than to polar aliphatic
compounds confirming the above adsorption isotherms. Moreover, quantitative
structure-activity relationship (QSAR) of the binding free energy with
independent physical properties of the test set systems for the first time
indicated that the polarizability, the partial charge on the carbon atoms, and
the molar volume are the most important properties controlling HCB-SOM
interactions.

detected by the WMAP and Planck satellites. These bubbles were likely inflated
by a jet launched from the vicinity of a supermassive black hole in the
Galactic center. Using MHD simulations, which self-consistently include
interactions between cosmic rays and magnetic fields, we build models of the
supersonic jet propagation, cosmic ray transport, and the magnetic field
amplification within the $Fermi$ bubbles. Our key findings are that: (1) the
synthetic $Fermi$ gamma-ray and WMAP microwave spectra based on our simulations
are consistent with the observations, suggesting that a single population of
cosmic ray leptons may simultaneously explain the emission across a range of
photon energies; (2) the model fits the observed centrally-peaked microwave
emission if a second, more recent, pair of jets embedded in the $Fermi$ bubbles
is included in the model. This is consistent with the observationally-based
suggestion made by Su & Finkbeiner (2012); (3) the radio emission from the
bubbles is expected to be strongly polarized due to the relatively high level
of field ordering caused by elongated turbulent vortices. This effect is caused
by the interaction of the shocks driven by the jets with the preexisting
interstellar medium turbulence; (4) a layer of enhanced rotation measure in the
shock-compressed region could exist in the bubble vicinity but the level of
this enhancement depends on the details of the magnetic topology.

to automatically identify and characterize parcels (AICP) with OpenStreetMap

for fine-scale urban modeling, urban studies, as well as spatial planning.
Conventional ways of identification and characterization of parcels rely on
remote sensing and field surveys, which are labor intensive and
resource-consuming. Poorly developed digital infrastructure, limited resources,
and institutional barriers have all hampered the gathering and application of
parcel data in developing countries. Against this backdrop, we employ OSM road
networks to identify parcel geometries and POI data to infer parcel
characteristics. A vector-based CA model is adopted to select urban parcels.
The method is applied to the entire state of China and identifies 82,645 urban
parcels in 297 cities. Notwithstanding all the caveats of open and/or
crowd-sourced data, our approach could produce reasonably good approximation of
parcels identified from conventional methods, thus having the potential to
become a useful supplement.

classes modulo $p$, for every sufficiently large prime $p$. The squares, or
more generally the integer values of any quadratic, are an example of such a
set. By the large sieve inequality the number of elements of $A$ that are at
most $X$ is $O(X^{1/2})$, and the quadratic examples show that this is sharp.
The simplest form of the inverse large sieve problem asks whether they are the
only examples. We prove a variety of results and formulate various conjectures
in connection with this problem, including several improvements of the large
sieve bound when the residue classes occupied by $A$ have some additive
structure. Unfortunately we cannot solve the problem itself.

As an example, we study in detail a quantum gas with three hyperfine states
coupled by the Raman lasers, and show when the state-dependent energy shifts of
the three states are comparable, triple-degenerate minima will appear at the
bottom of the band dispersions, thus realizing a spin-1 spin-orbit coupled
quantum gas. A novel feature of this three minima regime is that there can be
two different kinds of stripe phases with different wavelengths, which has an
interesting connection to the ferromagnetic and polar phases of spin-1 spinor
BECs without spin-orbit coupling.

$\overline{\partial}^\pi w= 0, \, d(w^*\lambda \circ j) = 0$ \emph{without

this paper, we first prove a canonical neighborhood theorem of the locus $Q$
foliated by closed Reeb orbits of a Morse-Bott contact form. Then using a
general framework of the three-interval method, we establish exponential decay
estimates for contact instantons $(w,j)$ of the triad $(M,\lambda,J)$, with
$\lambda$ a Morse-Bott contact form and $J$ a CR-almost complex structure
adapted to $Q$, under the condition that the asymptotic charge of $(w,j)$ at
the associated puncture vanishes.
  We also apply the three-interval method to the symplectization case and
provide an alternative approach via tensorial calculations to exponential decay
estimates in the Morse-Bott case for the pseudoholomorphic curves on the
symplectization of contact manifolds. This was previously established by
Bourgeois [Bou] (resp. by Bao [Ba]), by using special coordinates, for the
cylindrical (resp. for the asymptotically cylindrical) ends. The exponential
decay result for the Morse-Bott case is an essential ingredient in the set-up
of the moduli space of pseudoholomorphic curves which plays a central role in
contact homology and symplectic field theory (SFT).

to the rapid fluctuation of the voltage, a more advanced volt-ampere reactive

a measure of its complexity. Lovasz, Spencer and Vesztergombi (1986) related
the natural extension of this quantity to matrices to rounding algorithms for

we study a number of fundamental graph problems in a message-passing model for

that jointly perform computations on $n$-node graphs. The graph is assumed to
be partitioned in a balanced fashion among the $k$ machines, a common
implementation in many real-world systems. Communication is point-to-point via
bandwidth-constrained links, and the goal is to minimize the round complexity,
i.e., the number of communication rounds required to finish a computation.
  We present a generic methodology that allows to obtain efficient algorithms
in the $k$-machine model using distributed algorithms for the classical CONGEST
model of distributed computing. Using this methodology, we obtain algorithms
for various fundamental graph problems such as connectivity, minimum spanning
trees, shortest paths, maximal independent sets, and finding subgraphs, showing
that many of these problems can be solved in $\tilde{O}(n/k)$ rounds; this
shows that one can achieve speedup nearly linear in $k$.
  To complement our upper bounds, we present lower bounds on the round
complexity that quantify the fundamental limitations of solving graph problems
distributively. We first show a lower bound of $\Omega(n/k)$ rounds for
computing a spanning tree of the input graph. This result implies the same
bound for other fundamental problems such as computing a minimum spanning tree,
breadth-first tree, or shortest paths tree. We also show a $\tilde
\Omega(n/k^2)$ lower bound for connectivity, spanning tree verification and
other related problems. The latter lower bounds follow from the development and
application of novel results in a random-partition variant of the classical
communication complexity model.

data object is represented as a bag of instances and associated with multiple
class labels, referred to as multi-instance multi-label (MIML) learning.
Contrary to the common assumption in MIML that each instance in a bag belongs
to one of the known classes, in novelty detection, we focus on the scenario
where bags may contain novel-class instances. The goal is to determine, for any
given instance in a new bag, whether it belongs to a known class or a novel
class. Detecting novelty in the MIML setting captures many real-world phenomena
and has many potential applications. For example, in a collection of tagged
images, the tag may only cover a subset of objects existing in the images.
Discovering an object whose class has not been previously tagged can be useful
for the purpose of soliciting a label for the new object class. To address this
novel problem, we present a discriminative framework for detecting new class
instances. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method,
and reveal that the presence of unlabeled novel instances in training bags is
helpful to the detection of such instances in testing stage.

the developing world. Mosquitoes are the carriers of the parasite responsible
for the disease, and hence malaria control programs focus on controlling
mosquito populations. This is done primarily through the spraying of
insecticides, or through the use of insecticide treated bed nets. However,
usage of these insecticides exerts massive selection pressure on mosquitoes,
resulting in insecticide resistant mosquito breeds. Hence, developing
alternative strategies is crucial for sustainable malaria control. Here we
explore the usefulness of paratransgenesis, i.e., introducing genetically
engineered bacteria which secrete anti-plasmodium molecules, inside the
mosquito midgut. The bacteria enter a mosquito's midgut when it drinks from a
sugar bait, i.e., a sugar solution containing the bacterium. We formulate a
mathematical model for evaluating the number of such baits required for
preventing an outbreak. We study scenarios where vectors and hosts mix
homogeneously as well as heterogeneously. We perform a full stability analysis
and calculate the basic reproductive number for both the cases. Additionally,
for the heterogeneous mixing scenario, we propose a targeted bait distribution
strategy. The optimal bait allocation is calculated and is found to be
extremely efficient in terms of bait usage. Our analyses suggest that
paratransgenesis can prevent an outbreak, and hence it offers a viable and
sustainable path to malaria control.

x=0.15, 0.30, 0.45, 0.60, 0.75 and 0.90 to explore the structural and
ferroelectric properties. A conventional double sintering method was used to
prepare the xNi0.9Zn0.1Fe2O4/(1-x)PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 composites. The structure of
one of the component Ni0.9Zn0.1Fe2O4 is spinel cubic with space group Fd3m,
while the other component PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 is selected around the morphotropic
phase boundary region in which the tetragonal and monoclinic phases with space
group P4mm and Cm coexist respectively. We have carried out Rietveld refinement
of the structure to check the formation of ideal composites with separate
ferroelectric and ferrite phases. Even though the structural characterization
does not reveal the formation of any new phase due to reaction between the two
components of the composite during sintering, the tetragonality of the
PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 continuously decreases with increasing the ferrite fraction
while the lattice parameter of ferrite phase increases with increasing fraction
of the ferroelectric phase. Similarly, the dielectric study reveals clear shift
in the ferroelectric to paraelectric phase transition temperature of
PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 during composite formation suggesting that part of Ni2+, Zn2+/
Fe3+ ions are diffusing at the B-site of PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 replacing Ti4+, which
in turn decreases its transition temperature. Scanning electron micrograph of
sintered pellet surface confirms the presence of two types of particle
morphology in the particulate composite, corresponding to ferrite and
ferroelectric phases.

This behavior also exists in the ratios of other stars, which is considered to
result from the low signal-to-noise ratio and the larger line width at the
high-frequency end and could not be predicted by stellar models in previous
work. Our calculations show that the behavior not only can be reproduced by
stellar models, but can be predicted by asymptotic formulas of the ratios. The
frequency ratios of the Sun, too, can be reproduced well by the asymptotic
formulas. The increased behavior derives from the fact that the gradient of
mean molecular weight at the bottom of the radiative region hinders the
propagation of p-modes, while the hindrance does not exist in the convective
core. This behavior should exist in the ratios of stars with a large convective
core. The characteristic of the ratios at high frequencies provides a strict
constraint on stellar models and aids in determining the size of the convective
core and the extent of overshooting. Observational constraints point to a star

reversible cell plasticity among cancer cells has received much attention very
recently. Here we present a generalized multi-phenotypic cancer model by
integrating cell plasticity with the conventional hierarchical structure of
cancer cells. We prove that under very weak assumption, the nonlinear dynamics
of multi-phenotypic proportions in our model has only one stable steady state
and no stable limit cycle. This result theoretically explains the phenotypic
equilibrium phenomena reported in various cancer cell lines. Furthermore,
according to the transient analysis of our model, it is found that cancer cell
plasticity plays an essential role in maintaining the phenotypic diversity in
cancer especially during the transient dynamics. Two biological examples with
experimental data show that the phenotypic conversions from NCSSs to CSCs
greatly contribute to the transient growth of CSCs proportion shortly after the
drastic reduction of it. In particular, an interesting overshooting phenomenon
of CSCs proportion arises in three-phenotypic example. Our work may pave the
way for modeling and analyzing the multi-phenotypic cell population dynamics

  2015",,"10.1137/1.9781611973730.36",,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider several types of internal queries, that is, questions about
fragments of a given text $T$ specified in constant space by their locations in
$T$. Our main result is an optimal data structure for Internal Pattern Matching
(IPM) queries which, given two fragments $x$ and $y$, ask for a representation
of all fragments contained in $y$ and matching $x$ exactly; this problem can be
viewed as an internal version of the Exact Pattern Matching problem. Our data
structure answers IPM queries in time proportional to the quotient $|y|/|x|$ of
fragments' lengths, which is required due to the information content of the
output. If $T$ is a text of length $n$ over an integer alphabet of size
$\sigma$, then our data structure occupies $O(n/ \log_\sigma n)$ machine words
(that is, $O(n\log \sigma)$ bits) and admits an $O(n/ \log_\sigma n)$-time
construction algorithm.
  We show the applicability of IPM queries for answering internal queries
corresponding to other classic string processing problems. Among others, we
derive optimal data structures reporting the periods of a fragment and testing
the cyclic equivalence of two fragments. IPM queries have already found
numerous further applications, following the path paved by the classic Longest
Common Extension (LCE) queries of Landau and Vishkin (JCSS, 1988). In
particular, IPM queries have been implemented in grammar-compressed and dynamic
settings and, along with LCE queries, constitute elementary operations of the
PILLAR model, developed by Charalampopoulos, Kociumaka, and Wellnitz (FOCS
2020).
  On the way to our main result, we provide a novel construction of string
synchronizing sets of Kempa and Kociumaka (STOC 2019). Our method, based on a
new restricted version of the recompression technique of Je\.z (J. ACM, 2016),
yields a hierarchy of $O(\log n)$ string synchronizing sets covering the whole
spectrum of fragments' lengths.

files and engage in collaborations, they require all files to have a single
owner who unilaterally makes access control decisions. Existing clouds are,
thus, agnostic to shared ownership. This can be a significant limitation in
many collaborations because one owner can, for example, delete files and revoke
access without consulting the other collaborators.
  In this paper, we first formally define a notion of shared ownership within a
file access control model. We then propose a solution, called Commune, to the
problem of distributively enforcing shared ownership in agnostic clouds, so
that access grants require the support of a pre-arranged threshold of owners.
Commune can be used in existing clouds without requiring any modifications to
the platforms. We analyze the security of our solution and evaluate its
scalability and performance by means of an implementation integrated with

appears because a spatially separated electron and hole can still recombine if
the classical excursion is within the coherence length of the electron-hole

  December 2014","10.1109/TIT.2014.2364403",,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper focuses on characterizing the fundamental performance limits that
can be expected from an ideal decoder given a general model, ie, a general
subset of ""simple"" vectors of interest. First, we extend the so-called notion
of instance optimality of a decoder to settings where one only wishes to
reconstruct some part of the original high dimensional vector from a
low-dimensional observation. This covers practical settings such as medical
imaging of a region of interest, or audio source separation when one is only
interested in estimating the contribution of a specific instrument to a musical
recording. We define instance optimality relatively to a model much beyond the
traditional framework of sparse recovery, and characterize the existence of an
instance optimal decoder in terms of joint properties of the model and the
considered linear operator. Noiseless and noise-robust settings are both
considered. We show somewhat surprisingly that the existence of noise-aware
instance optimal decoders for all noise levels implies the existence of a
noise-blind decoder. A consequence of our results is that for models that are
rich enough to contain an orthonormal basis, the existence of an L2/L2 instance
optimal decoder is only possible when the linear operator is not substantially
dimension-reducing. This covers well-known cases (sparse vectors, low-rank
matrices) as well as a number of seemingly new situations (structured sparsity
and sparse inverse covariance matrices for instance). We exhibit an
operator-dependent norm which, under a model-specific generalization of the
Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), always yields a feasible instance
optimality property. This norm can be upper bounded by an atomic norm relative
to the considered model.

period precision, and a factor of 2.5 in the epoch of inferior conjunction
$T_0$. While the new orbital period is consistent with the previous value of
Gottllieb et al. (1975), the new $T_0$ (and the amplitude of variation of the
Bowen line velocities) exhibited a significant shift, which we attribute to
variations in the emission geometry with epoch. We propagate the uncertainties

that while one relay transmits its signal to the next stage, the other relay
receives a signal from the previous stage. With such a pipelined scheme, the
source is active and sends a new information message in each time slot. We
consider the achievable rates for different coding schemes and compare them
with a cut-set upper bound, which is tight in certain conditions. In
particular, we show that both lattice-based Compute and Forward (CoF) and
Quantize reMap and Forward (QMF) yield attractive performance and can be easily

messages and joint (non-unique) decoding, if the quantization mean-square
distortion at the relays is chosen appropriately. Also, in the multi-hop case
the gap of QMF from the cut-set upper bound grows logarithmically with the
number of stages, and not linearly as in the case of ""noise level""
quantization. Furthermore, we show that CoF is particularly attractive in the
case of multi-hop relaying, when the channel gains have fluctuations not larger

we study call centers where customers can abandon, and abandoned customers may
redial, and when a customer finishes his conversation with an agent, he may
reconnect. We use a fluid model to derive first order approximations for the
number of customers in the redial and reconnect orbits in the heavy traffic. We
show that the fluid limit of such a model is the unique solution to a system of

the perturbative renormalization of the full theory. We find that Newton's
constant (dimensionless in Horava-Lifshitz gravity) is asymptotically free.
However, the DeWitt supermetric approaches its Weyl invariant form with the
same speed and the effective interaction coupling remains constant along the
flow. In other words, the would-be asymptotic freedom associated to the running
Newton's constant is exactly balanced by the strong coupling of the scalar mode
as the Weyl invariant limit is approached. We conclude that in such model the
UV limit is singular at one loop order, and we argue that a similar phenomenon
can be expected in the full theory, even in higher dimensions.

understanding and development of several important cognitive, psycho-motor,
attitudinal and affective abilities. In most of the Indian colleges and
universities (and probably at many other places all over the world) the usual
practice of performing a set of experiments, in a cook-book mode, seldom helps
students achieve the objectives of the physics laboratory courses and develop
the abilities and skills required to become a successful experimental
physicist. This paper describes the details of an instructional approach
designed and being followed by the author for a past few years, to encourage
students independent thinking in the physics laboratory. This instructional
approach encourages students active participation, independent thinking and
offers an opportunity to learn how to think scientifically during traditional
physics laboratory courses without major curriculum and content changes. Here,
guided problem solving approach is adopted by combining problem-solving and
guided design modes of instruction. In this approach an experiment is presented
as an experimental problem with well thought procedural instructions. During a
typical laboratory session, first an introductory demonstration is presented to
each group of a few students separately for the first twenty minutes by the
mentors as a prelude to the problem and the remaining laboratory time is made
available for students to independently solve the experimental problem. The
paper also illustrates the approach by describing a familiar experimental
problem and the demonstration on Electromagnetic damping with some details of
the experimental arrangement, which is being used by the author for training of
students and teachers at the introductory university level.

most of the daily liquidity is ""latent"" and furthermore vanishes linearly
around the current price, as a consequence of the diffusion of the price
itself. However, the numerical implementation of Toth et al. was criticised as
being unrealistic, in particular because all the ""intelligence"" was conferred
to market orders, while limit orders were passive and random. In this work, we
study various alternative specifications of the model, for example allowing
limit orders to react to the order flow, or changing the execution protocols.
By and large, our study lends strong support to the idea that the square-root
impact law is a very generic and robust property that requires very few
ingredients to be valid. We also show that the transition from super-diffusion
to sub-diffusion reported in Toth et al. is in fact a cross-over, but that the
original model can be slightly altered in order to give rise to a genuine phase
transition, which is of interest on its own. We finally propose a general
theoretical framework to understand how a non-linear impact may appear even in
the limit where the bias in the order flow is vanishingly small.

When the temperature is non-zero there is a critical magnetic field, above

near freezing temperature has been analysed in terms of critical behaviour and

the thermoelectric properties of the junction. We apply a variational
Lang-Firsov transformation and solve the equations of motion in the
Kadanoff-Baym formalism up to second order in the dot-lead coupling parameter.
We calculate the thermoelectric current and voltage for finite temperature
differences in the resonant and inelastic tunneling regimes. For a near
resonant dot level, the formation of a local polaron can boost the
thermoelectric effect because of the Franck-Condon blockade. The line shape of
the thermoelectric voltage signal becomes asymmetrical due to the varying
polaronic character of the dot state and in the nonlinear transport regime,
vibrational signatures arise.

clusters of spatially separated s=1 skyrmions. For very small radii, the

quantum particle in the presence of trapping sites, within the framework of
continuous-time classical and quantum random walk. The main emphasis is on the
qualitative differences in the temporal behavior of the survival probabilities
of both kinds of particles. As a general rule, static traps are far less
efficient to absorb quantum particles than classical ones. Several lattice
geometries are successively considered: an infinite chain with a single trap, a
finite ring with a single trap, a finite ring with several traps, and an
infinite chain and a higher-dimensional lattice with a random distribution of
traps with a given density. For the latter disordered systems, the classical
and the quantum survival probabilities obey a stretched exponential asymptotic
decay, albeit with different exponents. These results confirm earlier
predictions, and the corresponding amplitudes are evaluated. In the
one-dimensional geometry of the infinite chain, we obtain a full analytical
prediction for the amplitude of the quantum problem, including its dependence
on the trap density and strength.

a strong plasmon reflection at gaps in the graphene layer, which appear at the
steps between the SiC terraces. When the step height is around 1.5 nm, which is
two orders of magnitude smaller than the plasmon wavelength, the reflection
signal reaches 20% of its value at graphene edges, and it approaches 50% for
step heights as small as 5 nm. This intriguing observation is corroborated by
numerical simulations, and explained by the accumulation of a line charge at
the graphene termination. The associated electromagnetic fields at the graphene
termination decay within a few nanometers, thus preventing efficient plasmon
transmission across nanoscale gaps. Our work suggests that plasmon propagation
in graphene-based circuits can be tailored using extremely compact

paper is a review of the still-expanding repository of methods that have been
developed to reduce bias in the estimation of parametric models. The review
provides a unifying framework where all those methods are seen as attempts to
approximate the solution of a simple estimating equation. Of particular focus
is the maximum likelihood estimator, which despite being asymptotically
unbiased under the usual regularity conditions, has finite-sample bias that can
result in significant loss of performance of standard inferential procedures.
An informal comparison of the methods is made revealing some useful practical
side-effects in the estimation of popular models in practice including: i)
shrinkage of the estimators in binomial and multinomial regression models that
guarantees finiteness even in cases of data separation where the maximum
likelihood estimator is infinite, and ii) inferential benefits for models that

transport in combination with diverse Earth observing systems are a natural
choice to achieve this goal. It is shown that the ability to successfully
reconstruct the location and magnitude of an instantaneous source in global
chemical transport models (CTMs) decreases rapidly as a function of the time
interval between the pollution release and the observation time. A simple way
to quantitatively characterize this phenomenon is proposed based on the
effective -undesired- numerical diffusion present in current Eulerian CTMs and
verified using idealized numerical experiments. The approach presented consists
of using the adjoint-based optimization method in a state-of-the-art CTM,
GEOS-Chem, to reconstruct the location and magnitude of a realistic pollution
plume for multiple time scales. The findings obtained from these numerical
experiments suggest a time scale of 2 days after which the accuracy of the
adjoint-based optimization methodology is compromised considerably in current
global CTMs. In conjunction with the mean atmospheric velocity, the
aforementioned time scale leads to an estimate of a length scale of about
1700km, downwind from the source, beyond which measurements, in conjunction
with current global CTMs, may not be successfully utilized to reconstruct
continuous-in-time sources. The approach presented here can be utilized to

cause also PT symmetry breaking in PT symmetric systems. From a mathematical
point of view, this is caused by the fact that the phases of the wavefunctions
(eigenfunctions of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian) relative to one another are not
rigid when an EP is approached. The system is therefore able to align with the
environment to which it is coupled and, consequently, rigorous changes of the
system properties may occur. We compare analytically as well as numerically the
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a $2\times 2$ matrix that is characteristic
of either open quantum systems at high level density or of PT symmetric optical
lattices. In both cases, the results show clearly the influence of the
environment onto the system in the neighborhood of EPs. Although the systems
are very different from one another, the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions
indicate the same characteristic features.

simple and promising quantum feedback control scheme for deterministic
generation and stabilization of a three-qubit $W$ state in the superconducting

measurements of multiple qubits in a dispersive regime, which enables us not
only to infer the state of the qubits for further information processing but
also to create and stabilize the target $W$ state through adaptive quantum
feedback control. We simulate the dynamics of the proposed quantum feedback
control scheme using the quantum trajectory approach with an effective
stochastic maser equation obtained by a polaron-type transformation method and
demonstrate that in the presence of moderate environmental decoherence, the
average state fidelity higher than $0.9$ can be achieved and maintained for a
considerable long time (much longer than the single-qubit decoherence time).
This control scheme is also shown to be robust against measurement inefficiency
and individual qubit decay rate differences. Finally, the comparison of the
polaron-type transformation method to the commonly used adiabatic elimination
method to eliminate the cavity mode is presented.

in paper I for an irradiated, non-grey atmosphere by comparing it to a
state-of-the-art radiative transfer model. Then, using a grid of numerical
models, we calibrate the different coefficients of our analytical model for
irradiated solar-composition atmospheres of giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs.
  We show that the so-called Eddington approximation used to solve the angular
dependency of the radiation field leads to relative errors of up to 5% on the
temperature profile. We show that for realistic non-grey planetary atmospheres,
the presence of a convective zone that extends to optical depths smaller than
unity can lead to changes in the radiative temperature profile on the order of
20% or more. When the convective zone is located at deeper levels (such as for
strongly irradiated hot Jupiters), its effect on the radiative atmosphere is
smaller. We show that the temperature inversion induced by a strong absorber in
the optical, such as TiO or VO is mainly due to non-grey thermal effects
reducing the ability of the upper atmosphere to cool down rather than an
enhanced absorption of the stellar light as previously thought.
  Finally, we provide a functional form for the coefficients of our analytical
model for solar-composition giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs. This leads to
fully analytical pressure-temperature profiles for irradiated atmospheres with
a relative accuracy better than 10% for gravities between 2.5m/s^2 and 250
m/s^2 and effective temperatures between 100 K and 3000 K. This is a great
improvement over the commonly used Eddington boundary condition.

drive divergence at multiple genes. If populations under divergent selection
also exchange migrants, we expect genetic differentiation to be high at
selected loci, relative to the baseline caused by migration and genetic drift.
Indeed, empirical studies have found peaks of putatively adaptive
differentiation. These are highly variable in length, some of them extending
over several hundreds of thousands of base pairs. How can such 'islands of
divergence' be explained? Physical linkage produces elevated levels of
differentiation at loci close to genes under selection. However, whether this
is enough to account for the observed patterns of divergence is not well
understood. Here, we investigate the fate of a locally beneficial mutation that
arises in linkage to an existing migration-selection polymorphism and derive
two important quantities: the probability that the mutation becomes
established, and the expected time to its extinction. We find that intermediate
levels of recombinations are sometimes favourable, and that physical linkage
can lead to strongly elevated invasion probabilities and extinction times. We
provide a rule of thumb for when this is the case. Moreover, we quantify the
long-term effect of polygenic local adaptation on linked neutral variation.

error correction protocol} that has garnered considerable attention for actual
physical implementations, due to relatively high error thresholds ~1%, and
restriction to planar lattices with nearest-neighbour interactions. Here we
show a necessary element for SC error correction: high-fidelity parity
detection of two code qubits via measurement of a third syndrome qubit. The
experiment is performed on a sub-section of the SC lattice with three
superconducting transmon qubits, in which two independent outer code qubits are
joined to a central syndrome qubit via two linking bus resonators. With
all-microwave high-fidelity single- and two-qubit nearest-neighbour entangling
gates, we demonstrate entanglement distributed across the entire sub-section by
generating a three-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state with fidelity
~94%. Then, via high-fidelity measurement of the syndrome qubit, we
deterministically entangle the otherwise un-coupled outer code qubits, in
either an even or odd parity Bell state, conditioned on the syndrome state.
Finally, to fully characterize this parity readout, we develop a new
measurement tomography protocol to obtain a fidelity metric (90% and 91%). Our
results reveal a straightforward path for expanding superconducting circuits
towards larger networks for the SC and eventually a primitive logical qubit
implementation.

  SOFA is a novel and extensible optimizer for UDF-heavy dataflows. It builds
on a concise set of properties for describing the semantics of Map/Reduce-style
UDFs and a small set of rewrite rules, which use these properties to find a
much larger number of semantically equivalent plan rewrites than possible with
traditional techniques. A salient feature of our approach is extensibility: We
arrange user-defined operators and their properties into a subsumption
hierarchy, which considerably eases integration and optimization of new
operators. We evaluate SOFA on a selection of UDF-heavy dataflows from

outperforming the best plans found by its competitors by a factor of up to 6.

analysis of the full planetary phase curve leads to new estimates on the
planetary temperature and albedo, which remain degenerate in the Kepler band.

lower than at the transit wings, which would imply that the nightside of this

$\beta$ such that $$ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}{n^{-1/2}L(X_1, \dots, X_n)} =

ones originally established by Beardwood, Halton $\&$ Hammersley $0.625 \leq
\beta \leq 0.922$. We slightly improve both upper and lower bounds.

electromagnetic field is combined with the path-dependent formulation of the
gauge theory to simplify the quasiclassical propagator. The latter is achieved
due to a specific choice of the gauge corresponding to the use of the classical
path in the path-dependent formulation of the gauge theory, which leads to the
cancellation of the interaction part of the action in the Feynman path
integral. A simple expression for the quasiclassical propagator is obtained in
all cases of the external field when the classical equation of motion in this
field is integrable. As an example, new simple expressions for the propagators
are derived for a spinless charged particle interacting with the following
fields: an arbitrary constant and uniform electromagnetic field, an arbitrary
plane wave and, finally, an arbitrary plane wave combined with an arbitrary
constant and uniform electromagnetic field. In all these cases the
quasiclassical propagator coincides with the exact result.

kinetic term turned out an adequate tool for macroscopic description of the
dark sector. The zero-mass field acts as the dark energy. Its energy-momentum
tensor is a simple additive to the cosmological constant. Massive fields
{\phi}_{I} with {\phi}^{K}{\phi}_{K}<0 and {\phi}^{K}{\phi}_{K}>0 describe two
different forms of dark matter. The space-like ({\phi}^{K}{\phi}_{K}<0) massive
vector field is attractive. It is responsible for the observed plateau in
galaxy rotation curves. The time-like ({\phi}^{K}{\phi}_{K}>0) massive field
displays repulsive elasticity. In balance with dark energy and ordinary matter
it provides a four parametric diversity of regular solutions of the Einstein
equations describing different possible cosmological and oscillating
non-singular scenarios of evolution of the universe. In particular, the
singular big bang turns into a regular inflation-like transition from
contraction to expansion with the accelerate expansion at late times. The
fine-tuned Friedman-Robertson-Walker singular solution is a particular limiting
case at the boundary of existence of regular oscillating solutions in the
absence of vector fields. The simplicity of the general covariant expression
for the energy-momentum tensor allows to display the main properties of the
dark sector analytically and avoid unnecessary model assumptions.

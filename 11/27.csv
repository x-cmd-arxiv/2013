grow, we obtain an upper bound on the number of critical manifolds with energy
bounded by s: this upper bound is polynomial in s of degree l (the corank of

l-1. In the limit for s at infinity, all Betti numbers (except the zeroth) must
actually vanish: the admissible-loop space is contractible. In the case the
corank l=2 we compute exactly the leading coefficient of the sum of the Betti

these models new flavour violating interactions of ordinary quarks and leptons
are dominated by a new heavy Z^prime gauge boson with the strength of the
relevant couplings governed by four new parameters in the quark sector and the
parameter beta. We study the implications of these models for beta=+-n/sqrt{3}
with n=1,2,3. The case beta=-sqrt{3} leading to Landau singularities for
M_{Z'}approx 4Tev can be ruled out when the present constraints on Z^prime
couplings, in particular from LEP-II, are taken into account. For n=1,2
interesting results are found for M_{Z^prime}< 4Tev with largest NP effects for
beta<0 in B_d->K^*mu^+mu^- and the ones in B_{s,d}->mu^+mu^- for beta>0. As
Re(C_9^NP) can reach the values -0.8 and -0.4 for n=2 and n=1, respectively the
B_d-> K^*mu^+mu^- anomalies can be softened with the size depending on Delta
M_s/(Delta M_s)_SM and the CP-asymmetry S_{psiphi}. A correlation between
Re(C_9^NP) and BR(B_s->mu^+mu^-), identified for beta<0, implies for negative
Re(C_9^NP) uniquely suppression of BR(B_s->mu^+mu^-) relative to its SM value
which is favoured by the data. In turn also S_{psiphi}< S_{psiphi}^SM is
favoured having dominantly opposite sign to S_{psiphi}^SM. We find that the
absence of B_d-> K^*mu^+mu^- anomalies in the future data and confirmation of
the suppression of BR(B_s->mu^+mu^-) relative to its SM value would favour
beta=1/sqrt{3} and M_{Z'}approx 3Tev. Assuming lepton universality, we find an
upper bound |C_9^NP|<1.1(1.4) from LEP-II data for all Z' models with only
left-handed flavour violating couplings to quarks when NP contributions to

dependent. In this paper we will reformulate the Bardeen approach in a
completely covariant manner. For that, we introduce the notion of pure and
mixed tensors, which yields an adequate language to treat both perturbative
approaches in a common framework. We then stress that in the referred covariant
approach one necessarily introduces an additional hyper-surface choice to the
problem. Using our mixed and pure tensors approach, we were able to construct a
one-to-one map relating the usual gauge dependence of the Bardeen formalism
with the hyper-surface dependence inherent to the covariant approach. Finally,
through the use of this map, we define full non-linear tensors that at first
order correspond to the three known gauge invariant variables $\Phi$, $\Psi$
and $\Xi$, which are simultaneously foliation and gauge invariant. We then
stress that the use of the proposed mixed tensors allows one to construct
simultaneously gauge and hyper-surface invariant variables at any order.

  Sato","A statistical test to identify differences in clustering structures",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Statistical inference on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is
an important task in brain imaging. One major hypothesis is that the presence
or not of a psychiatric disorder can be explained by the differential
clustering of neurons in the brain. In view of this fact, it is clearly of
interest to address the question of whether the properties of the clusters have
changed between groups of patients and controls. The normal method of
approaching group differences in brain imaging is to carry out a voxel-wise
univariate analysis for a difference between the mean group responses using an
appropriate test (e.g. a t-test) and to assemble the resulting ""significantly
different voxels"" into clusters, testing again at cluster level. In this
approach of course, the primary voxel-level test is blind to any cluster
structure. Direct assessments of differences between groups (or reproducibility
within groups) at the cluster level have been rare in brain imaging. For this
reason, we introduce a novel statistical test called ANOCVA - ANalysis Of
Cluster structure Variability, which statistically tests whether two or more
populations are equally clustered using specific features. The proposed method
allows us to compare the clustering structure of multiple groups
simultaneously, and also to identify features that contribute to the
differential clustering. We illustrate the performance of ANOCVA through
simulations and an application to an fMRI data set composed of children with
ADHD and controls. Results show that there are several differences in the
brain's clustering structure between them, corroborating the hypothesis in the
literature. Furthermore, we identified some brain regions previously not
described, generating new hypothesis to be tested empirically.

planets, but also in some pairs of satellites around Saturn. The existence of
coorbital planets around other stars has also been proposed. For close-in
planets and satellites, the rotation slowly evolves due to dissipative tidal
effects until some kind of equilibrium is reached. When the orbits are nearly
circular, the rotation period is believed to always end synchronous with the
orbital period. Here we demonstrate that for coorbital bodies in quasi-circular
orbits, stable non-synchronous rotation is possible for a wide range of mass
ratios and body shapes. We show the existence of an entirely new family of
spin-orbit resonances at the frequencies $n\pm k\nu/2$, where $n$ is the
orbital mean motion, $\nu$ the orbital libration frequency, and $k$ an integer.
In addition, when the natural rotational libration frequency due to the axial
asymmetry, $\sigma$, has the same magnitude as $\nu$, the rotation becomes
chaotic. Saturn coorbital satellites are synchronous since $\nu\ll\sigma$, but
coorbital exoplanets may present non-synchronous or chaotic rotation. Our
results prove that the spin dynamics of a body cannot be dissociated from its
orbital environment. We further anticipate that a similar mechanism may affect
the rotation of bodies in any mean-motion resonance.

leptonic component of the electromagnetic cascade initiated by blazar
gamma-rays is deflected away by strong enough EGMF, suppressing the signal in
the Fermi window. Apart from magnetic fields, the development of such a cascade
might be affected by plasma instabilities due to interactions with the ionized
component of the Intergalactic Medium (IGM). In this paper we model the
electromagnetic cascade through a Monte Carlo simulation in which both effects
are taken into account separately, and we derive constraints on these scenarios
from the combined Fermi-HESS data set. In the specific case of 1ES 0229+200

certain computational problems much faster than otherwise possible. One
promising potential implementation is to use superconducting quantum bits in
the circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) architecture. There, the low energy
states of a nonlinear electronic oscillator are isolated and addressed as a
qubit. These qubits are capacitively coupled to the modes of a
microwave-frequency transmission line resonator which serves as a quantum
communication bus. Microwave electrical pulses are applied to the resonator to
manipulate or measure the qubit state. State control is calibrated using
diagnostic sequences that expose systematic errors. Hybridization of the
resonator with the qubit gives it a nonlinear response when driven strongly,
useful for amplifying the measurement signal to enhance accuracy. Qubits
coupled to the same bus may coherently interact with one another via the
exchange of virtual photons. A two-qubit conditional phase gate mediated by
this interaction can deterministically entangle its targets, and is used to
generate two-qubit Bell states and three-qubit GHZ states. These three-qubit
states are of particular interest because they redundantly encode quantum
information. They are the basis of the quantum repetition code prototypical of
more sophisticated schemes required for quantum computation. Using a
three-qubit Toffoli gate, this code is demonstrated to autonomously correct
either bit- or phase-flip errors. Despite observing the expected behavior, the
overall fidelity is low because of decoherence. A superior implementation of
cQED replaces the transmission-line resonator with a three-dimensional box
mode, increasing lifetimes by an order of magnitude. In-situ qubit frequency
control is enabled with control lines, which are used to fully characterize and
control the system Hamiltonian.

orbits of the outer billiards map on a sufficiently smooth closed curve were
always bounded. Five years later Moser asked the same question for a convex
polygon. In 1987 F. Vivaldi and A. Shaidenko showed that all orbits for a
regular polygon must be bounded. R. Schwartz recently showed that a
quadrilateral known as a Penrose Kite has unbounded orbits and he proposed that
'most' convex polygons support unbounded orbits.
  Except for a few special cases, very little is known about the dynamics of
the outer billiards map on regular polygons. In this paper we present a unified
approach to the analysis of regular polygons - using the canonical 'resonances'
which are shared by all regular N-gons. In the case of the regular pentagon and
regular octagon these resonances exist on all scales and the fractal structure
is well documented, but these are the only non-trivial cases that have been
analyzed. We present a partial analysis of the regular heptagon, but the
limiting structure is poorly understood and this does not bode well for the
remaining regular polygons. The minimal polynomial for the vertices of a
regular N-gon has degree Phi(N)/2 where Phi is the Euler totient function, so N
= 5, 7 and 11 are respectively quadratic, cubic and quintic. In the words of R.

feature of higher-curvature gravity theories. For definiteness, we bound
ourselves to the case of Lovelock gravities. These theories are known to have
several branches of asymptotically AdS solutions. Here, extending our previous
work, we show that phase transitions among some of these branches are driven by
a thermalon configuration: a bubble separating two regions of different
effective cosmological constants, generically hosting a black hole in the
interior. Above some critical temperature, this thermalon configuration is
preferred with respect to the finite-temperature AdS space, triggering a
sophisticated version of the Hawking-Page transition. After being created, the
unstable bubble configuration can in general dynamically change the asymptotic
cosmological constant. While this phenomenon already occurs in the case of a
gravity action with square curvature terms, we point out that in the case of
Lovelock theory with cubic (and higher) terms new effects appear. For instance,
the theory may admit more than one type of bubble and branches that are in
principle free of pathologies may also decay through the thermalon mechanism.
We also find ranges of the gravitational couplings for which the theory becomes
sick. These add up to previously found restrictions to impose tighter
constraints on higher-curvature gravities. The results of this paper point to
an intricate phase diagram which might accommodate similarly rich behavior in
the dual CFT side.

hard-bend magnet through a single- or multiple-slit (coded aperture) optical

inter-bunch spacing of as little as 4$~$ns. At $E_{\rm b}=2.1 $GeV, systematic
precision of $\sim 1~\mu$m is achieved for a beam size of $\sim12~\mu$m; this
is expected to scale as $\propto 1/\sigma_{\rm b}$ and $\propto 1/E_{\rm b}$.
Achieving this precision requires comprehensive alignment and calibration of
the detector, optical elements, and x-ray beam. Data from the xBSM have been
used to extract characteristics of beam oscillations on long and short
timescales, and to make detailed studies of low-emittance tuning, intra-beam
scattering, electron cloud effects, and multi-bunch instabilities.

collisions between these newly accelerated CRs and the CSM leads to not only
gamma rays but also secondary electrons and positrons that radiate synchrotron

followup observations in months-to-years, although the detectability strongly
depends on the CSM density as well as observed frequency. Detecting this signal
would give us a unique probe of CR acceleration at early times, and even
non-detections can put interesting limits on the possibility of CR ion
acceleration. Following our previous work, we also show that GeV gamma rays can
escape from the system without severe attenuation, encouraging point-source and

least some of the mid-sized icy moons of Saturn. Here we show that this more
intensive tidal dissipation is in full agreement with the evolved state of the
Titan-Hyperion resonance. This resonance was previously thought to be non-tidal
in origin, as the amount of tidal evolution required for its assembly is beyond
what is possible in models that assume that all the major moons are primordial.

to redistribute the Bell states' properties between different pairs of a four
qubits system. Achieving the task requires performing a von Neumann
measurement, which projects a pair of factorized qubits randomly onto one of
the four Bell states. In this work we propose a similar scheme, by performing
the same Bell-von Neumann measurement over two local qubits, each one initially
being correlated through an X-state with a spatially distant qubit. This
process swaps the X-feature without conditions, whereas the input entanglement
is partially distributed in the four possible outcome states under certain
conditions. Specifically, we obtain two threshold values for the input
entanglement in order for the outcome states to be nonseparable. Besides, we
find that there are two possible amounts of outcome entanglement, one is
greater and the other less than the input entanglement; the probability of

information, energy or influence are transmitted. In such directed networks,
analysing flows (and not only the strength of connections) is crucial to reveal
important features of the network that might go undetected if the orientation
of connections is ignored. We showcase here a flow-based approach for community
detection in networks through the study of the network of the most influential
Twitter users during the 2011 riots in England. Firstly, we use directed Markov
Stability to extract descriptions of the network at different levels of
coarseness in terms of interest communities, i.e., groups of nodes within which
flows of information are contained and reinforced. Such interest communities
reveal user groupings according to location, profession, employer, and topic.
The study of flows also allows us to generate an interest distance, which
affords a personalised view of the attention in the network as viewed from the
vantage point of any given user. Secondly, we analyse the profiles of incoming
and outgoing long-range flows with a combined approach of role-based similarity
and the novel relaxed minimum spanning tree algorithm to reveal that the users
in the network can be classified into five roles. These flow roles go beyond
the standard leader/follower dichotomy and differ from classifications based on
regular/structural equivalence. We then show that the interest communities fall
into distinct informational organigrams characterised by a different mix of
user roles reflecting the quality of dialogue within them. Our generic
framework can be used to provide insight into how flows are generated,
distributed, preserved and consumed in directed networks.

a nondeterministic model of the boson sampler is analyzed, which employs
partially indistinguishable single photons emitted by identical sources. A
sufficient condition on the average mutual fidelity $ \langle

realistic boson sampler outperforms the classical computer. Moreover, the boson
sampler computer with partially indistinguishable single photons is scalable
while being beyond the power of classical computers when the single photon mode

close reproduction of free electron dispersion. Experimentally, however, Li is
one of a handful of elemental solids (along with Cu, Ag, Au etc.) where the
sign of the Seebeck coefficient (S) is opposite to that of the carrier. This
counterintuitive behavior still lacks a satisfactory interpretation. We
calculate S fully from first-principles, within the framework of P.B. Allen's
formulation of Boltzmann transport theory. Here it is crucial to avoid the
constant relaxation time approximation, which gives a sign for S which is
necessarily that of the carriers. Our calculated S are in excellent agreement
with experimental data, up to the melting point. In comparison with another
alkali metal Na, we demonstrate that within the simplest non-trivial model for
the energy dependency of the electron lifetimes, the rapidly increasing density
of states (DOS) across the Fermi energy is related to the sign of S in Li. The
exceptional energy dependence of the DOS is beyond the free-electron model, as
the dispersion is distorted by the Brillouin Zone edge, a stronger effect in Li
than other Aliki metals. The electron lifetime dependency on energy is central,
but the details of the electron-phonon interaction are found to be less
important, contrary to what has been believed for several decades. Band
engineering combined with the mechanism exposed here may open the door to new
""ambipolar"" thermoelectric materials, with a tunable sign for the thermopower
even if either n- or p-type doping is impossible.

(`toothbrush') clusters ($z\sim0.2$) host enormous radio-emitting shocks with
simple geometry. We investigate the role of mergers and shocks in shaping the
H$\alpha$ luminosity function, using custom-made narrow-band filters matching
the cluster redshifts mounted on the INT. We surveyed $\sim0.28$ deg$^2$ for
each cluster and found $181$ line emitters in the `sausage' (volume of
$3.371\times10^3$ Mpc$^3$ for H$\alpha$ at $z=0.1945$) and $141$ in the
`toothbrush' ($4.546\times10^3$ Mpc$^3$ for H$\alpha$ at $z=0.225$), out of
which $49$ (`sausage') and $30$ (`toothbrush') are expected to be H$\alpha$. We
build luminosity functions for the field-of-view down to an average limiting
star formation rate of $0.14$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, find good agreement with
field luminosity functions at $z=0.2$, but significant differences between the
shapes of the luminosity functions for the two clusters. We discover extended,
tens-of-kpc-wide H$\alpha$ haloes in galaxies neighbouring relics, which were
possibly disrupted by the passage of the shock wave. By comparing the `sausage'
cluster with blank fields and other clusters, we also uncover an order of
magnitude boost (at $9\sigma$ level) in the normalisation $\phi^*$ of the
luminosity function in the relic areas. Our results suggest that cluster
mergers may play an important role in the evolution of cluster galaxies through
shock-induced star formation.

Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stt2270",,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Aperiodic broad-band variability (also known as flickering) is observed
throughout all types of accreting compact objects. Many statistical properties
of this variability can be naturally explained with the fluctuating accretion
disk model, where variations in the mass-transfer rate through the disk are
modulated on the local viscous timescale and propagate towards the central
compact object. Here, a recently developed implementation of the model is
applied for the first time to the time-averaged, high-frequency variability of
a cataclysmic variable star (MV Lyrae) observed with the Kepler satellite. A
qualitatively good fit to the data is achieved, suggesting the presence of
geometrically thick inner flow with large viscosity parameter, extending from
$\sim0.12R_{\odot}$ all the way to the white dwarf surface. A simple spectral
model of the system suggests that the geometrically thick component would not
contribute much to the observed optical flux originating from the geometrically
thin outer disk. Instead, X-ray reprocessing from the geometrically thick disk
onto the thin disk is proposed as a mechanism to explain the observed
variability. Similar flows are also deduced in accreting neutron stars/black
holes (X-ray binaries) and Active Galactic Nuclei. Additionally, eclipse
mapping studies of cataclysmic variables also seem to suggest the presence of a
geometrically extended flow towards the inner-edges of the accretion disk. The
fluctuating accretion disk model applied here is encouraging in understanding
the origin of flickering in cataclysmic variables, as well as in X-ray binaries
and Active Galactic Nuclei, by providing a unifying scheme by which to explain
the observed broad-band variability features observed throughout all compact
accreting systems.

from both theoretical and observational perspectives. We begin by discussing
the planet-planet interactions that take place within our own Solar System. We
then describe such interactions in more tightly-packed planetary systems. As
planet-planet interactions build up, some systems become dynamically unstable,
leading to strong encounters and ultimately either ejections or collisions of
planets. After discussing the basic physical processes involved, we consider
how these interactions apply to extrasolar planetary systems and explore the
constraints provided by observed systems. The presence of a residual
planetesimal disc can lead to planetary migration and hence cause instabilities
induced by resonance crossing; however, such discs can also stabilise planetary
systems. The crowded birth environment of a planetary system can have a
significant impact: close encounters and binary companions can act to
destabilise systems, or sculpt their properties. In the case of binaries, the
Kozai mechanism can place planets on extremely eccentric orbits which may later
circularise to produce hot Jupiters.

conveniently. Here, we show that it is possible to visualize and investigate
the grain boundaries in CVD-grown graphene using an infrared nano-imaging

graphene grain boundaries, thus causing plasmon interference. By recording and
analyzing the interference patterns, we can map grain boundaries for a large
area CVD-grown graphene film and probe the electronic properties of individual
grain boundaries. Quantitative analysis reveals that grain boundaries form
electronic barriers that obstruct both electrical transport and plasmon
propagation. The effective width of these barriers (~10-20 nm) depends on the
electronic screening and it is on the order of the Fermi wavelength of
graphene. These results uncover a microscopic mechanism that is responsible for
the low electron mobility observed in CVD-grown graphene, and suggest the
possibility of using electronic barriers to realize tunable plasmon reflectors

double-white dwarf binary NLTT 11748. This system consists of a carbon/oxygen
white dwarf and an extremely-low mass (< 0.2 Msun) helium-core white dwarf in a
5.6 hr orbit. To date such extremely-low mass WDs, which can have thin,
stably-burning outer layers, have been modeled via poorly-constrained
atmosphere and cooling calculations where uncertainties in the detailed
structure can strongly influence the eventual fates of these systems when
mass-transfer begins. With precise (individual precision ~1%) high-cadence (~2
s) multi-color photometry of multiple primary and secondary eclipses spanning
>1.5 yr, we constrain the masses and radii of both objects in the NLTT 11748
system to a statistical uncertainty of a few percent. However, we find that
overall uncertainty in the thickness of the envelope of the secondary
carbon/oxygen white dwarf leads to a larger (~13%) systematic uncertainty in
the primary He WD's mass. Over the full range of possible envelope thicknesses
we find that our primary mass (0.136-0.162 Msun) and surface gravity
(log(g)=6.32-6.38; radii are 0.0423-0.0433 Rsun) constraints do not agree with
previous spectroscopic determinations. We use precise eclipse timing to detect
the Romer delay at 7 sigma significance, providing an additional weak
constraint on the masses and limiting the eccentricity to e*cos(omega)= -4e-5
+/- 5e-5. Finally, we use multi-color data to constrain the secondary's
effective temperature (7600+/-120 K) and cooling age (1.6-1.7 Gyr).

the gauge group. The Turaev-Viro model, which is an example of spin foam model
is also defined in terms of a quantum group. By extension, it is believed that
in 4d, a quantum group structure could encode the presence of $\Lambda\neq0$.
In this article, we introduce by hand the quantum group
$\mathcal{U}_{q}(\mathfrak{su}(2))$ into the LQG framework, that is we deal
with $\mathcal{U}_{q}(\mathfrak{su}(2))$-spin networks. We explore some of the
consequences, focusing in particular on the structure of the observables. Our
fundamental tools are tensor operators for $\mathcal{U}_{q}(\mathfrak{su}(2))$.
We review their properties and give an explicit realization of the spinorial

this deformed case, which is given by the quantum group
$\mathcal{U}_{q}(\mathfrak{u}(n))$. We are then able to build geometrical
observables, such as the length, area or angle operators ... We show that these
operators characterize a quantum discrete hyperbolic geometry in the 3d LQG
case. Our results confirm that the use of quantum group in LQG can be a tool to
introduce a non-zero cosmological constant into the theory.

require explanation, encapsulated in Reichenbach's Principle of Common Cause.
Despite being a hallmark of scientific thought, dropping the principle has been
widely regarded as a much less bitter medicine than the perceived
alternative---dropping relativistic causality. Recently, however, some authors
have proposed that modified forms of Reichenbach's principle could be
maintained even with relativistic causality. Here we break down Reichenbach's
principle into two independent assumptions---the Principle of Common Cause
proper, and Factorisation of Probabilities. We show how Bell's theorem can be
derived from these two assumptions plus Relativistic Causality and the Law of
Total Probability for actual events, and we review proposals to drop each of
these assumptions in light of the theorem. In particular, we show that the
non-commutative common causes of Hofer-Szabo and Vecsernyes fail to have an
analogue of the notion that the common causes can explain the observed
correlations. Moreover, we show that their definition can be satisfied
trivially by any quantum product state for any quantum correlations. We also
discuss how the conditional states approach of Leifer and Spekkens fares in
this regard.

20 years can reduce the uncertainty of $\Omega_m$ by more than 42% than

find that in order to match the constraint power of OHD and SNIa, we need 21

the first time the number of years required for the velocity drift to become
comparable with current observations on the equation of state $w$. The
statistical FoM indicate that we need at least 12 years to cover current
observations. Physically, we could monitor 30 quasars for 30 years to obtain
the same accuracy of $w$. Considering two parameterized deceleration factor
$q(z)$, we find that the available observations give an estimation on current
value $-0.9 \lesssim q_0 \lesssim -0.3$. Difference between the two types of
$q(z)$ is the precise determination of variation rate $dq/dz$. For the first
model with constant $dq/dz$, $\Delta v$ with only 10 years provides a much
better constraint on it, especially when compared with SNIa. However, we need
$\Delta v$ for more years in the variable $dq/dz$ model. We find that $\Delta
v$ with 30 years reduces the uncertainty of transition redshift to
approximately three times better than those of OHD and SNIa.

light propagating in higher order fibre modes has a greater evanescent field
extension around the waist in comparison with the fundamental mode. By
exploiting this behaviour, we demonstrate that the detected signal of

waist is larger ($\sim$6 times) when higher order guided modes are considered

a potential barrier must strictly conserve the cone index and this leads to the
protected cone transport which is unique in AA-stacked BLG. Together with the
negative refraction of electrons, electrons residing in different cones can be
spatially separated according to their cone index when transmitted across an

(hexabundles) for multi-object spectrographs. We have characterised the
performance of hexabundles with different cladding thicknesses and compared
them to that of the same type of bare fibre, across the range of fill-fractions
and input f-ratios likely in an IFU instrument. Hexabundles with 7-cores and
61-cores were tested for focal ratio degradation (FRD), throughput and
cross-talk when fed with inputs from F/3.4 to >F/8. The five 7-core bundles
have cladding thickness ranging from 1 to 8 microns, and the 61-core bundles
have 5micron cladding. As expected, the FRD improves as the input focal ratio
decreases. We find that the FRD and throughput of the cores in the hexabundles
match the performance of single fibres of the same material at low input
f-ratios. The performance results presented can be used to set a limit on the
f-ratio of a system based on the maximum loss allowable for a planned

possible ways to satisfy the typicality criterion: there was pre-inflation near
the high energy scale, the potential is finely tuned or the inflationary field

contact angle of a fluid on the electrostatic potential of the substrate, is
analyzed in terms of the density functional theory of wetting. It is shown that
electrowetting is not an electrocapillarity effect, i.e., it cannot be
consistently understood in terms of the variation of the substrate-fluid
interfacial tension with the electrostatic substrate potential, but it is
related to the depth of the effective interface potential. The key feature,
which has been overlooked so far and which occurs naturally in the density
functional approach is the structural change of a fluid if it is brought into
contact with another fluid. These structural changes occur in the present
context as the formation of finite films of one fluid phase in between the
substrate and the bulk of the other fluid phase. The non-vanishing Donnan
potentials (Galvani potential differences) across such film-bulk fluid
interfaces, which generically occur due to an unequal partitioning of ions as a
result of differences of solubility contrasts, lead to correction terms in the
electrowetting equation, which become relevant for sufficiently small substrate
potentials. Whereas the present density functional approach confirms the
commonly used electrocapillarity-based electrowetting equation as a good
approximation for the cases of metallic electrodes or electrodes coated with a
hydrophobic dielectric in contact with an electrolyte solution and an ion-free
oil, a significantly reduced tendency for electrowetting is predicted for
electrodes coated with a dielectric which is hydrophilic or which is in contact
with two immiscible electrolyte solutions.

Therefore, a precise forecasting of their likely geo-effectiveness relies on an
accurate tracking of their morphological and kinematical evolution throughout
the interplanetary medium. However, single view-point observations require many
assumptions to model the development of the features of CMEs, the most common
hypotheses were those of radial propagation and self-similar expansion. The use
of different view-points shows that at least for some cases, those assumptions
are no longer valid. From radial propagation, typical attributes that can now
been confirmed to exist are; over-expansion, and/or rotation along the
propagation axis. Understanding of the 3D development and evolution of the CME
features will help to establish the connection between remote and in-situ
observations, and hence help forecast Space Weather. We present an analysis of
the morphological and kinematical evolution of a STEREO B-directed CME on 2009

observations provided by SOHO, STEREO and SDO missions, and in-situ
measurements recorded by Wind, ACE, and MESSENGER, we prove in this paper that
the event exhibits signatures of deflection, which are usually associated to
changes in the direction of propagation and/or also with rotation. The
interaction with other magnetic obstacles could act as a catalyst of deflection

  problems discretized by the discontinuous Galerkin method",,,,,"math.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","  This paper discusses the computation of derivatives for optimization problems
governed by linear hyperbolic systems of partial differential equations (PDEs)
that are discretized by the discontinuous Galerkin (dG) method. An efficient
and accurate computation of these derivatives is important, for instance, in
inverse problems and optimal control problems. This computation is usually
based on an adjoint PDE system, and the question addressed in this paper is how
the discretization of this adjoint system should relate to the dG
discretization of the hyperbolic state equation. Adjoint-based derivatives can
either be computed before or after discretization; these two options are often
referred to as the optimize-then-discretize and discretize-then-optimize
approaches. We discuss the relation between these two options for dG
discretizations in space and Runge-Kutta time integration. Discretely exact
discretizations for several hyperbolic optimization problems are derived,
including the advection equation, Maxwell's equations and the coupled
elastic-acoustic wave equation. We find that the discrete adjoint equation
inherits a natural dG discretization from the discretization of the state
equation and that the expressions for the discretely exact gradient often have
to take into account contributions from element faces. For the coupled
elastic-acoustic wave equation, the correctness and accuracy of our derivative
expressions are illustrated by comparisons with finite difference gradients.
The results show that a straightforward discretization of the continuous
gradient differs from the discretely exact gradient, and thus is not consistent
with the discretized objective. This inconsistency may cause difficulties in
the convergence of gradient based algorithms for solving optimization problems.

short wire samples was assessed in the temperature range from 4.2 to 15 K in
applied fields of up to 7 T by means of SQUID magnetometry in the unirradiated

revealed that the exponents in the pinning force function differ significantly

volume pinning force. A model is presented, which describes the pinning force
function of irradiated wires using a two-component ansatz involving a

designed to match the worst-case lower bound, deciding in exactly t+1 rounds in

early stopping protocols. These dominate the first ones, by always deciding in
at most t+1 rounds, but often much faster. A protocol is unbeatable if it can't
be strictly dominated. Unbeatability is often a much more suitable notion of
optimality for distributed protocols than worst-case performance. Using a
knowledge-based analysis, this paper studies unbeatability for both consensus
and k-set consensus. We present unbeatable solutions to non-uniform consensus
and k-set consensus, and uniform consensus in synchronous message-passing
contexts with crash failures.
  The k-set consensus problem is much more technically challenging than
consensus, and its analysis has triggered the development of the topological
approach to distributed computing. Worst-case lower bounds for this problem
have required either techniques based on algebraic topology, or reduction-based
proofs. Our proof of unbeatability is purely combinatorial, and is a direct,
albeit nontrivial, generalization of the one for consensus. We also present an
alternative topological unbeatability proof that allows to understand the
connection between the connectivity of protocol complexes and the decision time
of processes.
  For the synchronous model, only solutions to the uniform variant of k-set
consensus have been offered. Based on our unbeatable protocols for uniform
consensus and for non-uniform k-set consensus, we present a uniform k-set
consensus protocol that strictly dominates all known solutions to this problem

populations (YSP) that dominate the optical spectra. The YSPs are all found to
have relatively young ages (tysp < 40$ Myr), strongly implying that the latest

quasi-simultaneously. The lack of reddening deduced from both continuum
modelling and the measured Balmer decrements (E(B-V) <0.3) suggests that
starburst and/or AGN induced outflows have already effectively removed a
substantial proportion of the gas and dust from the central region. These
findings starkly contrast with model predictions which suggest an offset of a

further source of adhesion. We provide the analytic solution to the problem

hole candidate ESO 243-49 HLX-1 before and during the 2012 outburst. We show
that the V-band magnitudes vary with time, thus proving that a portion of the
observed emission originates in the accretion disk. Using the first quiescent
optical observations of HLX-1, we show that the stellar population surrounding
HLX-1 is fainter than V~25.1 and R~24.2. We show that the optical emission may
increase before the X-ray emission consistent with the scenario proposed by
Lasota et al. (2011) in which the regular outbursts could be related to the
passage at periastron of a star circling the intermediate mass black hole in an
eccentric orbit, which triggers mass transfer into a quasi-permanent accretion
disk around the black hole. Further, if there is indeed a delay in the X-ray
emission we estimate the mass-transfer delivery radius to be ~1e11 cm.

almost undistorted and sooner by time $76.12 \ ms$ than the pulse which leaves
the medium of Wang \emph{et al.}. The Gaussian pulse always remains almost

which we derive the X-ray luminosity and a global X-ray temperature for 25 of
them. For 23 clusters we were able to fit the X-ray emissivity with a
beta-model and subtract it to detect substructures in the X-ray gas. A
dynamical analysis based on the SG method was applied to the clusters having at
least 15 spectroscopic galaxy redshifts in the cluster range: 18 X-ray clusters
and 11 clusters with no X-ray data. Only major substructures will be detected.
Ten substructures were detected both in X-rays and by the SG method. Most of
the substructures detected both in X-rays and with the SG method are probably
at their first cluster pericentre approach and are relatively recent infalls.
We also find hints of a decreasing X-ray gas density profile core radius with
redshift. The percentage of mass included in substructures was found to be
roughly constant with redshift with values of 5-15%, in agreement both with the
general CDM framework and with the results of numerical simulations. Galaxies
in substructures show the same general behaviour as regular cluster galaxies;
however, in substructures, there is a deficiency of both late type and old
stellar population galaxies. Late type galaxies with recent bursts of star
formation seem to be missing in the substructures close to the bottom of the
host cluster potential well. However, our sample would need to be increased to
allow a more robust analysis.

this solution, compute the surface gravity of the trapping horizons, and show
that the generalized first law of black hole dynamics proposed by Hayward holds

renewables is calling for a transition from the centralized control of
electrical distribution grids to a distributed control scenario. In this
context, distributed generators (DGs) are exploited to achieve other objectives
beyond supporting loads, such as the minimization of the power losses along the
distribution lines. The aim of this work is that of designing a full-fledged
system that extends existing state of the art algorithms for the distributed
minimization of power losses. We take into account practical aspects such as
the design of a communication and coordination protocol that is resilient to
link failures and manages channel access, message delivery and DG coordination.
Thus, we analyze the performance of the resulting optimization and
communication scheme in terms of power loss reduction, reduction of aggregate
power demand, convergence rate and resilience to communication link failures.
After that, we discuss the results of a thorough simulation campaign, obtained
using topologies generated through a statistical approach that has been
validated in previous research, by also assessing the performance deviation
with respect to localized schemes, where the DGs are operated independently.
Our results reveal that the convergence and stability performance of the
selected algorithms vary greatly. However, configurations exist for which
convergence is possible within five to ten communication steps and, when just
30% of the nodes are DGs, the aggregate power demand is roughly halved. Also,
some of the considered approaches are quite robust against link failures as
they still provide gains with respect to the localized solutions for failure
rates as high as 50%.

eigenvalues of networks having such couplings, and find that they follow
completely different statistics when in the balanced situation. Based on
numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the transition from Weibull to
Fr\'echet via the Gumbel distribution can be controlled by the variance of the
column sum of the adjacency matrix, which depends monotonically on the
denseness of the underlying network. As a balanced condition is imposed, the
largest real part of the eigenvalue emulates a transition to the generalized
extreme value statistics, independent of the inhibitory connection probability.
Furthermore, the transition to the Weibull statistics and the small-world
transition occur at the same rewiring probability, reflecting a more stable
system.

and multivariate normal Stein equations are obtained. Our general order bounds
involve fewer derivatives of the test function than those in the existing
literature. We apply these bounds and local approach couplings to obtain an
order $n^{-(p-1)/2}$ bound, for smooth test functions, for the distance between
the distribution of a standardised sum of independent and identically
distributed random variables and the standard normal distribution when the
first $p$ moments of these distributions agree. We also obtain a bound on the
convergence rate of a sequence of distributions to the normal distribution when
the moment sequence converges to normal moments.

this type of formation flying include 1) imaging systems, in which an optical

the other spacecraft, including telescopes capable of very high angular
resolution; 2) systems in which the front spacecraft of a pair carries an

controlling the trapping process are crucial in the study of trapping
problem---random walks with a single trap. In this paper, we study the trapping
problem occurring on unweighted and weighted networks, respectively. The
networks under consideration display the striking scale-free, small-world, and
modular properties, as observed in diverse real-world systems. For binary
networks, we concentrate on three cases of trapping problems with the trap
located at a peripheral node, a neighbor of the root with the least
connectivity, and a farthest node, respectively. For weighted networks with
edge weights controlled by a parameter, we also study three trapping problems,
in which the trap is placed separately at the root, a neighbor of the root with
the least degree, and a farthest node. For all the trapping problems, we obtain
the analytical formulas for the average trapping time (ATT) measuring the
efficiency of the trapping process, as well as the leading scaling of ATT. We
show that for all the trapping problems in the binary networks with a trap
located at different nodes, the dominating scalings of ATT reach the possible
minimum scalings, implying that the networks have optimal structure that is
advantageous to efficient trapping. Furthermore, we show that for trapping in
the weighted networks, the ATT is controlled by the weight parameter, through
modifying which, the ATT can behave superlinealy, linearly, sublinearly, or
logarithmically with the system size. This work could help improving the design
of systems with efficient trapping process and offers new insight into control
of trapping in complex systems.

volumes, but also allows us to minimize the influence of the dielectric fiber
mirrors on the trapped-ion pseudopotential. We discuss the effect of clipping
losses for long FFPCs and the effect of angular and lateral displacements on
the coupling efficiencies between cavity and fiber. Optical profilometry allows
us to determine the radii of curvature and ellipticities of the fiber mirrors.
From finesse measurements we infer a single-atom cooperativity of up to $12$
for FFPCs longer than $200 \mu$m in length; comparison to cavities constructed
with reference substrate mirrors produced in the same coating run indicates
that our FFPCs have similar scattering losses. We discuss experiments to anneal
fiber mirrors and explore the influence of the atmosphere under which annealing
occurs on coating losses, finding that annealing under vacuum increases the
losses for our reference substrate mirrors. Our unique linear Paul trap design
provides clearance for such a cavity and is miniaturized to shield trapped ions
from the dielectric fiber mirrors. We numerically calculate the trap potential
in the absence of fibers. In the experiment additional electrodes can be used
to compensate distortions of the potential due to the fibers. Home-built fiber
feedthroughs connect the FFPC to external optics, and an integrated
nanopositioning system affords the possibility of retracting or realigning the

constraints, it is possible to conclude whether pairs of cells are functionally
connected and in which direction. After testing the method against synthetic

suited for this type of networking signal propagation where signals are

measures for assessing the impact of drugs on the functional connectivity

supplementary periods were obtained with the TAROT telescopes. We confirm that
the period distribution of the halo strongly resembles that of Fornax, and we
found that is it very different from the C stars in the solar neighbourhood.
There is a larger proportion of short period Mira/SRa variables in the halo

be summarized as follows: i) neutron star mergers can be entirely responsible

longer than 1 Myr for the bulk of binary systems, the Eu yield is around $3

range 20-50 M$_\odot$, produce yields of Eu of the order of $10^{-8}-10^{-9}$

in amplitude is more pronounced for stars with higher frequency of maximum
power. In this work we want to characterize KIC 8561221 in order to confirm
that it is currently the least evolved star among this peculiar subset and to
discuss several hypotheses that could help explain the reduction of the dipole
mode amplitudes. We used Kepler short- and long-cadence data combined with
spectroscopic observations to infer the stellar structure and dynamics of KIC
8561221. We then discussed different scenarios that could contribute to the
reduction of the dipole amplitudes such as a fast rotating interior or the
effect of a magnetic field on the properties of the modes. We also performed a
detailed study of the inertia and damping of the modes. We have been able to
characterize 37 oscillations modes, in particular, a few dipole modes above
nu_max that exhibit nearly normal amplitudes. We have inferred a surface
rotation period of around 91 days and uncovered the existence of a variation in
the surface magnetic activity during the last 4 years. As expected, the
internal regions of the star probed by the l = 2 and 3 modes spin 4 to 8 times
faster than the surface. With our grid of standard models we are able to
properly fit the observed frequencies. Our model calculation of mode inertia
and damping give no explanation for the depressed dipole modes. A fast rotating
core is also ruled out as a possible explanation. Finally, we do not have any
observational evidence of the presence of a strong deep magnetic field inside
the star.

fields in neutron star crusts under the influence of the Hall effect and
subdominant Ohmic dissipation. In the Hall effect, differential rotation of the
electron fluid generates toroidal field by winding of the poloidal field. For
this reason, we focus on the influence of the initial choice of the electron
angular velocity profile on the subsequent and long term magnetic evolution.
Whereas previous simulations have generally chosen angular velocities
increasing outwards, corresponding to the lowest order Ohmic mode in the crust,
a more realistic choice is an angular velocity decreasing outwards,
corresponding to the MHD equilibrium field that is likely present at the time
of crust formation. We find that the evolution passes through three basic
phases. The early evolution is a response to the initial conditions. During the
second phase the field consists of poloidal and toroidal components which
eventually relax to an isorotation state in which the angular velocity of the
electrons becomes constant along poloidal magnetic field lines, causing Hall
evolution to saturate. In the third phase the field dissipates slowly while
maintaining isorotation. We discuss the implications for the long term field
structure and observable properties of isolated neutron stars.

a locally varying slip distribution along the fluid-fluid interface, which
models the effect of the secondary fluid on the outer flow. The obtained
closed-form analytical expressions for the flow field and effective slip length
of the primary fluid explicitly contain the influence of the viscosities of the
two fluids as well as the magnitude of the local slip, which is a function of
the surface geometry. They agree well with results from numerical computations
of the full geometry. The analytical expressions allow investigating the
influence of the viscous stresses inside the secondary fluid for arbitrary
geometries of the rectangular grooves. For classic superhydrophobic surfaces,
the deviations in the effective slip length compared to the case of inviscid

only depend on two variables. This class of solutions includes the Kerr
solution and its charged generalizations that have been studied in the
literature. We here present an inverse scattering method that allows to
systematically construct solutions of this integrable system. The method is
similar to the one of Belinski and Zakharov for pure gravity but uses a
different linear system due to Breitenlohner and Maison and here requires some
technical modifications. We illustrate this method by constructing a
four-charge rotating solution from flat space. A generalization to other
set-ups is also discussed.

concerning certain remarks raised by us on the realistic accuracy obtainable in
testing the general relativistic Lense-Thirring effect in the gravitational
field of the Earth with the newly launched LARES satellite together with the
LAGEOS and LAGEOS II spacecraft in orbit for a long time. The orbital
configuration of LARES is different from that of the originally proposed
LAGEOS-3. Indeed, while the latter one should have been launched to the same
altitude of LAGEOS (i.e. about $h_{\rm L}=5890$ km) in an orbital plane
displaced by $180$ deg with respect to that of LAGEOS ($I_{\rm L}=110$ deg,
$I_{\rm L3}=70$ deg), LARES currently moves at a much smaller altitude (about
$h_{\rm LR}=1440$ km) and at a slightly different inclination ($I_{\rm LR} =
69.5$ deg). As independently pointed out in the literature by different
authors, the overall accuracy of a LARES-LAGEOS-LAGEOS II Lense-Thirring test
may be unfavorably \textcolor{black}{impacted} by the lower altitude of LARES
with respect to the expected $\approx 1%$ level claimed by Ciufolini \textit{et
al.} because of an enhanced sensitivity to the low-degree even zonal
geopotential coefficients inducing orbital precessions competing with the
relativistic ones. Concerning the previous tests performed with the combined
nodes of only LAGEOS and LAGEOS II, an independent analysis recently appeared
in the literature indirectly confirms that the total uncertainty in them is
likely far from being as little as $10%$.

we constrain (for example) not the full matrix of correlations, but only the
distribution from which these correlations are drawn. In this sense, what we
have constructed is an inverse spin glass: rather than choosing coupling
constants at random from a distribution and calculating correlations, we choose
the correlations from a distribution and infer the coupling constants. We argue
that such models generate a block structure in the space of couplings, which
provides an explicit solution of the inverse problem. This allows us to
generate a phase diagram in the space of (measurable) moments of the
distribution of correlations. We expect that these ideas will be most useful in
building models for systems that are nonequilibrium statistical mechanics
problems, such as networks of real neurons.

fissile material smuggled in this manner is difficult because of the large
volume and mass available for shielding. Here I review methods for screening
cargo containers to detect the possible presence of nuclear threats. Because of
the large volume of innocent international commerce, and the cost and
disruption of secondary screening by opening and inspection, it is essential
that the method be rapid and have a low false-positive rate. Shielding can
prevent the detection of neutrons emitted spontaneously or by induced fission.
The two promising methods are muon tomography and high energy X-radiography. If

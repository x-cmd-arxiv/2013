of versatility, robustness and performance. Its main features are the use of

that if a family of subsets of $[n]$ is union-closed, some element appears in
at least half the sets of the family. A natural weakening is that the
union-closed conjecture holds for large families; that is, families consisting
of at least $p_02^n$ sets for some constant $p_0$. The first result in this

metallicities for open clusters that were derived from a variety of photometric
and spectroscopic methods. The current article focuses on spectroscopic
methods. The aim is to compile a comprehensive set of clusters with the most
reliable metallicities from high-resolution spectroscopic studies. This set of
metallicities will be the basis for a calibration of metallicities from
different methods. The literature was searched for [Fe/H] estimates of
individual member stars of open clusters based on the analysis of
high-resolution spectra. For comparison, we also compiled [Fe/H] estimates
based on spectra with low and intermediate resolution. At medium and high
resolution, we found that differences in the analysis methods have a stronger
effect on metallicity than quality differences in the observations. We retained
only highly probable cluster members and introduced a restriction on
atmospheric parameters. We combined 641 individual metallicity values for 458
stars in 78 open clusters from 86 publications to form our final set of
high-quality cluster metallicities. The photometric metallicities discussed in
the first paper of this series are systematically lower than the spectroscopic
ones by about 0.1 dex, and the differences show a scatter of about 0.2 dex. In
a preliminary comparison of our spectroscopic sample with models of Galactic
chemical evolution, none of the models predicts the observed radial metallicity
gradient. Photometric metallicities show a large intrinsic dispersion, while
the more accurate spectroscopic sample presented in this paper comprises fewer
than half the number of clusters. Only a sophisticated combination of all
available photometric and spectroscopic data will allow us to trace the
metallicity distribution in the Galactic disk on a local and global scale.

a minimum subset of vertices that induces a connected subgraph of G and
dominates at least n' vertices. We obtain the first polynomial time algorithm
with an O(\ln \Delta) approximation factor for this problem, thereby
significantly extending the results of Guha and Khuller (Algorithmica, Vol.
20(4), Pages 374-387, 1998) for the connected dominating set problem. We note
that none of the methods developed earlier can be applied directly to solve
this problem. In the budgeted connected dominating set problem, there is a
budget on the number of vertices we can select, and the goal is to dominate as
many vertices as possible. We obtain a (1/13)(1 - 1/e) approximation algorithm
for this problem. Finally, we show that our techniques extend to a more general
setting where the profit function associated with a subset of vertices is a
monotone ""special"" submodular function. This generalization captures the
connected dominating set problem with capacities and/or weighted profits as
special cases. This implies a O(\ln q) approximation (where q denotes the
quota) and an O(1) approximation algorithms for the partial and budgeted
versions of these problems. While the algorithms are simple, the results make a
surprising use of the greedy set cover framework in defining a useful profit

Here we calculate numerically, from first principles, the DOS of KBr:CN glass,

associated to a Hamiltonian is invariant under a surjective cellular automaton
if and only if the cellular automaton conserves the Hamiltonian. A special case
is the (well-known) invariance of the uniform Bernoulli measure under
surjective cellular automata, which corresponds to the conservation of the

pre-injective factor map between shifts of finite type turns out to be always a
Gibbs measure. We provide a sufficient condition under which the image of a
Gibbs measure under a pre-injective factor map is not a Gibbs measure. We point
out a potential application of pre-injective factor maps as a tool in the study
of phase transitions in statistical mechanical models.

ensemble of cold, trapped atomic spins and a paraxial laser beam, coupled
through a dispersive interaction. To achieve strong entanglement between the
collective atomic spin and the photons, one must match the spatial mode of the
collective radiation of the ensemble with the mode of the laser beam while
minimizing the effects of decoherence due to optical pumping. For ensembles
coupling to a probe field that varies over the extent of the cloud, the set of
atoms that indistinguishably radiates into a desired mode of the field defines
an inhomogeneous spin wave. Strong coupling of a spin wave to the probe mode is
not characterized by a single parameter, the optical density, but by a
collection of different effective atom numbers that characterize the coherence
and decoherence of the system. To model the dynamics of the system, we develop
a full stochastic master equation, including coherent collective scattering
into paraxial modes, decoherence by local inhomogeneous diffuse scattering, and
backaction due to continuous measurement of the light entangled with the spin
waves. This formalism is used to study the squeezing of a spin wave via
continuous quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement. We find that the greatest
squeezing occurs in parameter regimes where spatial inhomogeneities are
significant, far from the limit in which the interface is well approximated by
a one-dimensional, homogeneous model.

technology, and crowd sensing leveraging pervasive sensors called onboard units
(OBUs), like smartphones and radio frequency IDentifications to provide sensing
services, have attracted increasing attention from both industry and academy.
Nowadays, existing vehicular sensing applications lack good mechanisms to
improve the maximum achievable throughput and minimizing service time of
participating sensing OBUs in vehicular sensor networks. To fill these gaps, in
this paper, first, we introduce real imperfect link states to the calculation
of Markov chains. Second, we incorporate the result of different link states
for multiple types of vehicles with the calculations of uplink throughput and
service time. Third, in order to accurately calculate the service time of an
OBU, we introduce the steady state probability to calculate the exact time of a
duration for back-off decrement, rather than using the traditional relative
probability. Additionally, to our best knowledge, we first explore a
multichannel scheduling strategy of uplink data access in a single roadside
unit (RSU) by using a non-cooperative game in a RSU coverage region to maximize
the uplink throughput and minimize service time under saturated and unsaturated
traffic loads. To this end, we conduct a theoretical analysis and find the
equilibrium point of the scheduling. The numerical results show that the
solution of the equilibrium points are consistent with optimization problems.

organization of complex systems from first principles, as increased efficiency
of physical action. Most simply stated, physical action is the product of the
energy and time necessary for motion. When complex systems are modeled as flow
networks, this efficiency is defined as a decrease of action for one element to
cross between two nodes, or endpoints of motion - a principle of least unit
action. We find a connection with another principle that of most total action,
or a tendency for increase of the total action of a system. This increase
provides more energy and time for minimization of the constraints to motion in
order to decrease unit action, and therefore to increase organization. Also,
with the decrease of unit action in a system, its capacity for total amount of
action increases. We present a model of positive feedback between action
efficiency and the total amount of action in a complex system, based on a
system of ordinary differential equations, which leads to an exponential growth
with time of each and a power law relation between the two. We present an
agreement of our model with data for core processing units of computers. This
approach can help to describe, measure, manage, design and predict future

whole query graph at the same time, and vertex-at-a-time, which process a
single vertex of the query graph at the same time. In this paper, we propose a
new vertex-at-a-time proposal that is based on graphlets, each of which
comprises a vertex of a graph, all of the immediate neighbors of that vertex,

dimension. Our initial state is a right going eigenstate of the Hamiltonian at
time t=0. It consists of a plane wave incoming from the left, a reflected plane
wave on the left of the barrier and a transmitted wave on its right. We find
that at later times, the evolving wave function has a finite overlap with left
going eigenstates of the Hamiltonian at time t=0. For simplicity we present an
exact result for a time dependent delta function potential. Then we show that
our result is not an artifact of that specific choice of the potential. This
surprising result does not agree with our interpretation of the eigenstates of
the Hamiltonian at time t=0. A numerical study of evolving wave packets, does
not find any corresponding real effect. Namely, we do not see on the right hand
side of the barrier any evidence for a left going packet. Our conclusion is
thus that the intriguing result mentioned above is intriguing only due to the
semantics of the interpretation.

result of Huynh and Nordstr\""om: if $S$ is a search problem with critical block
sensitivity $b$, then every randomised two-party protocol solving a certain
two-party lift of $S$ requires $\Omega(b)$ bits of communication. Besides
simplicity, our proof has the advantage of generalising to the multi-party

bounds for Tseitin and Pebbling search problems to obtain the following
applications:
  (1) Monotone Circuit Depth: We exhibit a monotone $n$-variable function in NP
whose monotone circuits require depth $\Omega(n/\log n)$; previously, a bound
of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ was known (Raz and Wigderson, JACM 1992). Moreover, we
prove a $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ monotone depth bound for a function in monotone P.

first length--space lower bounds for semi-algebraic proof systems, including
Lov\'asz--Schrijver and Lasserre (SOS) systems. In particular, these results
extend and simplify the works of Beame et al. (SICOMP 2007) and Huynh and

  We consider both linear and piecewise parameterizations of the dark energy

  The more general the form of the dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ being

parameterization of $w(z)$, HzSCs give only small improvements over planned
supernova and baryon acoustic oscillation measurements; a wide redshift range
with many low redshift points is optimal to constrain this linear model.

language based on metric linear-time temporal logic (MTL). MTL features
temporal operators that are indexed by time intervals, allowing one to specify
timing-dependent security policies. The design of the language is driven by the
problem of runtime monitoring of applications in mobile devices. A main case
the study is the privilege escalation attack in the Android operating system,
where an app gains access to certain resource or functionalities that are not
explicitly granted to it by the user, through indirect control flow. To capture
these attacks, we extend MTL with recursive definitions, that are used to
express call chains betwen apps. We then show how the metric operators of MTL,
in combination with recursive definitions, can be used to specify policies to
detect privilege escalation, under various fine grained constraints. We present
a new algorithm, extending that of linear time temporal logic, for monitoring
safety policies written in our specification language. The monitor does not
need to store the entire history of events generated by the apps, something
that is crucial for practical implementations. We modified the Android OS
kernel to allow us to insert our generated monitors modularly. We have tested
the modified OS on an actual device, and show that it is effective in detecting
policy violations.

amazing progress in showing lower bounds for the so called extension

  We answer this question negatively. In fact, the extension complexity of the

$33^\circ$ or $57^\circ$. However, whether $\theta_{K_1}$ is greater or less
than $45^\circ$ is still quite controversial. For example, there were two very
recent studies of the strong decays of $K_1$ mesons. One group claimed that
$\theta_{K_1}\approx 60^\circ$, while the other group obtained
$\theta_{K_1}=(33.6\pm4.3)^\circ$. Since the determination of the mixing angles
$\alpha_{^3\!P_1}$ and $\alpha_{^1\!P_1}$ with the former (latter) being the
mixing angle of $f_1(1285)$ ($h_1(1170)$) and $f_1(1420)$ ($h_1(1380)$) in the
flavor basis through mass relations depend on $\theta_{K_1}$, we show that
$\theta_{K_1}\approx 57^\circ$ is ruled out as it leads to a too large
deviation from ideal mixing in the $^1\!P_1$ sector, inconsistent with the
lattice calculation of $\alpha_{^1\!P_1}$ and the observation of strong decays
of $h_1(1170)$ and $h_1(1380)$. We find that for $\theta_{K_1}\approx
(28-30)^\circ$, the corresponding $\alpha_{^3\!P_1}$ and $\alpha_{^1\!P_1}$
agree well with all lattice and phenomenological analyses. This again
reinforces the statement that $\theta_{K_1}\sim 33^\circ$ is much more favored
than $57^\circ$.

broad and does not fit to the data perfectly, but the data also show there may
be fluctuation in the spectrum. There is no associated $Z$-boson or Higgs boson

prominence-cavity system: the cavity is under-dense because it is evacuated by
supplying mass to the condensed prominence. The thermal non-equilibrium (TNE)
model of prominence formation offers a theoretical framework to predict the
thermodynamic evolution of the prominence and the surrounding corona. We
examine the evidence for a prominence-cavity connection by comparing the TNE
model with diagnostics of dynamic extreme ultraviolet emission (EUV)
surrounding the prominence, specifically prominence horns. Horns are correlated
extensions of prominence plasma and coronal plasma which appear to connect the
prominence and cavity. The TNE model predicts that large-scale brightenings
will occur in the SDO/AIA 171\AA\ bandpass near the prominence that are
associated with the cooling phase of condensation formation. In our
simulations, variations in the magnitude of footpoint heating lead to
variations in the duration, spatial scale, and temporal offset between emission
enhancements in the other EUV bandpasses. While these predictions match well a
subset of the horn observations, the range of variations in the observed
structures is not captured by the model. We discuss the implications of our
one-dimensional loop simulations for the three-dimensional time-averaged
equilibrium in the prominence and the cavity. Evidence suggests that horns are
likely caused by condensing prominence plasma, but the larger question of
whether this process produces a density-depleted cavity requires a more tightly
constrained model of heating and better knowledge of the associated magnetic
structure.

magnetic models of prominence structure. We extract one dimensional magnetic
field lines from a 3D MHD model of a flux rope and solve for hydrostatic
balance along these field lines incorporating field-aligned thermal conduction,
uniform heating, and radiative losses. The 1D hydrostatic solutions for density
and temperature are then mapped back into three dimensional space, which allows
us to consider the projection of multiple structures. We find that the 3D flux
rope is composed of several distinct field line types. A majority of the flux
rope interior field lines are twisted but not dipped. These field lines are
density-reduced relative to unsheared arcade field lines. We suggest the cavity
may form along these short interior field lines which are surrounded by a
sheath of dipped field lines. This geometric arrangement would create a cavity

identify two different scattering mechanisms which depend differently on the

and the supported part of MoX$_2$ which decreases with decreasing binding
distance and increasing contact area. (ii) An edge resistance across the 1D
interface between metal-supported and free-standing MoX$_2$ which increases
with decreasing binding distance and is independent on contact area. The origin
of the edge resistance is a metal-induced potential shift within the MoX$_2$
layer. The optimal metal thus depends on the junction geometry. In the case of
MoS$_2$, we find that for short contacts, L$<$6 nm, Ti electrodes (with short
binding distance) gives the lowest resistance, while for longer contacts, Au

di-hadron correlations in azimuth angle and pseudorapidity in Pb-Pb collisions
at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 2.76 \tev$ and photon-hadron correlations in pp
collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7 \tev$ with the ALICE detector, respectively. In
di-hadron correlations, the near-side jet shape in the short-range correlation
region is quantitatively analyzed at $\ptt < 8 \gmom$, and the modification of
jet-particle yield, $I_{\rm AA}$ and $I_{\rm CP}$, is measured at $8 < \ptt <
15 \gmom$. In photon-hadron correlations, isolated leading photon and
associated hadrons in its opposite azimuthal direction correlations are used to
estimate the jet fragmentation function via the imbalance parameter, $x_{\rm E}
\equiv -\frac{\vec{p}_{\rm T}^{\gamma}\cdot\vec{p}_{\rm T}^{\rm
h^{\pm}}}{|\vec{p}_{\rm T}^{\gamma}|^{2}}$.

Driven motion in the blastoderm cells was also observed with an average

transducer without look-ahead. Removing the look-ahead from a transducer, if

CoRoT (Convection, Rotation and planetary Transits) satellite brought clear
evidence that Be outbursts are directly correlated with pulsations. We found
that it may be the transport of angular momentum by waves or pulsation modes
that brings the already rapid stellar rotation to its critical value at the
surface, and allows the star to eject material. The recent discovery of
stochastically excited gravito-inertial modes by CoRoT in a hot Be star
strengthens this scenario. We present the CoRoT observations and modeling of
several Be stars and describe the new picture of the Be phenomenon which arose

sample of FGK dwarf planet hosts with stellar parameters derived in a
homogeneous way from the SWEET-Cat database to study the relation between
stellar metallicity and position of planets in the period-mass diagram. In the
second part we use all the RV-detected planets orbiting FGK stars to explore
the role of planet-disk and planet-planet interaction on the evolution of
orbital properties of planets with masses above 1MJup. We show that planets
orbiting metal-poor stars have longer periods than those in metal-rich systems.
This trend is valid for masses at least from 10MEarth to 4MJup. Earth-like
planets orbiting metal-rich stars always show shorter periods (fewer than 20
days) than those orbiting metal-poor stars. We also found statistically
significant evidence that very high mass giants have on average more eccentric
orbits than giant planets with lower mass.Finally, we show that the
eccentricity of planets with masses higher than 4MJup tends to be lower for
planets with shorter periods. Our results suggest that the planets in the P-MP
diagram are evolving differently because of a mechanism that operates over a
wide range of planetary masses. This mechanism is stronger or weaker depending
on the metallicity of the respective system. One possibility is that planets in
metal-poor disks form farther out from their central star and/or they form
later and do not have time to migrate as far as the planets in metal-rich
systems. The trends and dependencies obtained for very high mass planetary
systems suggest that planet-disk interaction is a very important and
orbit-shaping mechanism for planets in the high-mass domain. Shortened.

fluctuations of a physical system only after removing the influence of the
level density by unfolding the spectra. When the level density is known,
unfolding is done by using the integrated level density to transform the
eigenvalues into dimensionless variables with unit mean spacing. When it is not
known, as in most practical cases, one usually approximates the level staircase
function by a polynomial. We here study the effect of unfolding procedure on
the spectral fluctuation of two systems for which the level density is known
asymptotically. The first is a time-reversal-invariant chaotic system, which is
modeled in RMT by a Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE). The second is the case
of chaotic systems in which m quantum numbers remain almost undistorted in the
early stage of the stochastic transition. The Hamiltonian of a system may be
represented by a block diagonal matrix with m blocks of the same size, in which
each block is a GOE. Unfolding is done once by using the asymptotic level
densities for the eigenvalues of the m blocks and once by representing the
integrated level density in terms of polynomials of different orders. We find
that the spacing distribution of the eigenvalues shows a little sensitivity to
the unfolding method. On the other hand, the variance of level number
{\Sigma}2(L)is sensitive to the choice of the unfolding function. Unfolding
that utilizes low order polynomials enhances {\Sigma}2(L) relative to the
theoretical value, while the use of high order polynomial reduces it. The
optimal value of the order of the unfolding polynomial depends on the dimension
of the corresponding ensemble.

  In this paper, we circumvent the difficulties of choosing the number of
clusters by adopting the Bayesian semiparametric mixture model approach
introduced by Bhattacharya (2008), who assume that the number of clusters is a
random quantity, but is bounded above by a (possibly large) number of clusters.
We adopt the perfect simulation approach of Mukhopadhyay and Bhattacharya
(2012) for posterior simulation for completely solving the problems of
convergence of the underlying Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach.
Importantly, within our main perfect simulation algorithm, there arose the
necessity to simulate perfectly from the joint distribution of a set of
continuous random variables with log-concave full conditional densities. We
propose and develop a novel and efficient perfect simulation methodology for
joint distributions with log-concave full conditionals. This perfect sampling
methodology is of independent interest as well since in a very large and
important class of Bayesian applications the full conditionals turn out to be
log-concave.
  We will consider application of our model and methodology to the Austrian
wage mobility data, also analysed by Pamminger and Fruwirth-Schnatter (2010),
and adopting the methods developed in Mukhopadhyay et al. (2011), Mukhopadhyay
et al. (2012), will obtain the posterior modes of clusterings and also the
desired highest posterior distribution credible regions of the posterior
distribution of clusterings.

to design anticancer drugs that are efficacious over a broad range of cancers.
The robustness of cellular responses to gene knockout and the need to reduce
undesirable side effects also contribute to the problem of effective
anti-cancer drug design. To promote the successful selection of drug targets,
each potential target should be subjected to a systems biology scrutiny to
locate effective and specific targets while minimizing undesirable side
effects. The gene p53 is considered a good candidate for such a target because
it has been implicated in 50% of all cancers and is considered to encode a hub
protein that is highly connected to other proteins. Using P53 as a test case,
this paper explores the capacity of the systems biology tool, CellDesigner, to
aid in the selection of anticancer drug targets and to serve as a teaching

out to be predominantly positive at all wavenumbers. This sign is consistent
with what is theoretically expected for the southern hemisphere. The magnetic
helicity normalized to its theoretical maximum value, here referred to as
relative helicity, is around 4% and strongest at intermediate wavenumbers of k
~ 0.4 Mm^{-1}, corresponding to a scale of 2pi/k ~ 16 Mm. The same sign and a
similar value are also found for the relative current helicity evaluated in
real space based on the vertical components of magnetic field and current
density. The modulus of the magnetic helicity spectrum shows a k^{-11/3} power
law at large wavenumbers, which implies a k^{-5/3} spectrum for the modulus of
the current helicity. A k^{-5/3} spectrum is also obtained for the magnetic
energy. The energy spectra evaluated separately from the horizontal and
vertical fields agree for wavenumbers below 3 Mm^{-1}, corresponding to scales

power of natural selection is expected to be limited. This is due to clonal
interference - the competition of clones carrying different beneficial
mutations - which leads to the loss of many small effect mutations and fixation
of large effect ones. If interference is abundant, then mechanisms for
horizontal transfer of genes, which allow the immediate combination of
beneficial alleles in a single background, are expected to evolve. However, the
relevance of interference in natural complex environments, such as the gut, is
poorly known. To address this issue, we studied the invasion of beneficial
mutations responsible for Escherichia coli's adaptation to the mouse gut and
demonstrate the pervasiveness of clonal interference. The observed dynamics of
change in frequency of beneficial mutations are consistent with soft sweeps,
where a similar adaptive mutation arises repeatedly on different haplotypes
without reaching fixation. The genetic basis of the adaptive mutations revealed
a striking parallelism in independently evolving populations. This was mainly
characterized by the insertion of transposable elements in both coding and
regulatory regions of a few genes. Interestingly in most populations, we
observed a complete phenotypic sweep without loss of genetic variation. The
intense clonal interference during adaptation to the gut environment, here
demonstrated, may be important for our understanding of the levels of strain

instruments conceived to measure the optical turbulence (OT) vertical
distribution on the whole troposphere and low stratosphere (~ 20 km) widely
used in the astronomical context. In this paper we perform a detailed
analysis/comparison of measurements provided by the two instruments and taken
during the extended site testing campaign carried out on 2007 at Cerro Paranal
and promoted by the European Southern Observatory (ESO). The main and final
goal of the study is to provide a detailed estimation of the measurements
reliability i.e dispersion of turbulence measurements done by the two
instruments at different heights above the ground. This information is directly
related to our ability in estimating the absolute value of the turbulence
stratification. To better analyse the uncertainties between the MASS and the GS
we took advantage of the availability of measurements taken during the same
campaign by a third independent instrument (DIMM - Differential Imaging Motion
Monitor) measuring the integrated turbulence extended on the whole 20 km. Such
a cross-check comparison permitted us to define the reliability of the
instruments and their measurements, their limits and the contexts in which
their use can present some risk.

calls for new, ""software-defined"", approaches to simplify and quicken

StreaMon is a carefully designed data-plane abstraction devised to scalably
decouple the ""programming logic"" of a traffic analysis application (tracked
states, features, anomaly conditions, etc.) from elementary primitives
(counting and metering, matching, events generation, etc), efficiently
pre-implemented in the probes, and used as common instruction set for
supporting the desired logic. Multi-stage multi-step real-time tracking and
detection algorithms are supported via the ability to deploy custom states,
relevant state transitions, and associated monitoring actions and triggering
conditions. Such a separation entails platform-independent, portable, online
traffic analysis tasks written in a high level language, without requiring
developers to access the monitoring device internals and program their custom
monitoring logic via low level compiled languages (e.g., C, assembly, VHDL). We
validate our design by developing a prototype and a set of simple (but
functionally demanding) use-case applications and by testing them over real
traffic traces.

nucleate and expand in the supercooled metastable phase. In many cases, the
growth of bubbles reaches a stationary state, with bubble walls propagating as
detonations or deflagrations. However, these hydrodynamical solutions may be
unstable under corrugation of the interface. Such instability may drastically
alter some of the cosmological consequences of the phase transition. Here, we
study the hydrodynamical stability of deflagration fronts. We improve upon
previous studies by making a more careful and detailed analysis. In particular,
we take into account the fact that the equation of motion for the phase
interface depends separately on the temperature and fluid velocity on each side
of the wall. Fluid variables on each side of the wall are similar for weakly
first-order phase transitions, but differ significantly for stronger phase
transitions. As a consequence, we find that, for large enough supercooling, any
subsonic wall velocity becomes unstable. Moreover, as the velocity approaches
the speed of sound, perturbations become unstable on all wavelengths. For
smaller supercooling and small wall velocities, our results agree with those of
previous works. Essentially, perturbations on large wavelengths are unstable,
unless the wall velocity is higher than a critical value. We also find a
previously unobserved range of marginally unstable wavelengths. We analyze the
dynamical relevance of the instabilities, and we estimate the characteristic
time and length scales associated to their growth. We discuss the implications
for the electroweak phase transition and its cosmological consequences.

in the M87 jet, we propose an hourglass model that is a modified two-zone
system of Tavecchio & Ghisellini (hereafter TG08): a slow hourglass-shaped or
Laval nozzle-shaped layer connected by two revolving exponential surfaces
surrounding a fast spine, through which plasma blobs flow. Based on the
conservation of magnetic flux, the magnetic field changes along the axis of the
hourglass. We adopt the result of TG08---the high-energy emission from GeV to
TeV can be produced through inverse Compton by the two-zone system, and the
photons from radio to X-ray are mainly radiated by the fast inner zone system.
Here, we only discuss the light curves of the fast inner blob from radio to
X-ray. When a compressible blob travels down the axis of the first bulb in the
hourglass, because of magnetic flux conservation, its cross section experiences
an adiabatic compression process, which results in particle acceleration and
the brightening of HST-1. When the blob moves into the second bulb of the
hourglass, because of magnetic flux conservation, the dimming of the knot
occurs along with an adiabatic expansion of its cross section. A similar broken
exponential function could fit the TeV peaks in M87, which may imply a
correlation between the TeV flares of M87 and the light curves from radio to
X-ray in HST-1. The Very Large Array (VLA) 22 GHz radio light curve of HST-1
verifies our prediction based on the model fit to the main peak of the VLA 15
GHz radio light curve.

origin is both internal and external in Jupiter and Neptune. Despite its first
detection in Uranus a decade ago, the magnitude of its internal and external
sources remains unconstrained.
  Aims. We targeted CO lines in Uranus in the submillimeter range to constrain
its origin.
  Methods. We recorded disk-averaged spectra of Uranus with a very high
spectral resolution at the frequencies of CO rotational lines in the
submillimeter range in 2011-2012. We used empirical and diffusion models of the
atmosphere of Uranus to constrain the origin of CO. We also used a
thermochemical model of its troposphere to derive an upper limit on the O/H
ratio in the deep atmosphere of Uranus.
  Results. We have detected the CO(8-7) rotational line for the first time,
with Herschel-HIFI. Both empirical and diffusion model results show that CO has
an external origin. An empirical profile in which CO is constant above the
100mbar level with a mole fraction of 7.1-9.0E-9 (depending on the adopted
stratospheric thermal structure) reproduces the data. Sporadic and steady
source models cannot be differentiated with our data. Taking Teanby & Irwin's
internal source model upper limit of a mole fraction of 2.1E-9 [Teanby & Irwin
2013. ApJ, 775, L49], the deep O/H ratio of Uranus is lower than 500 times
solar according to our thermochemical computations.
  Conclusions. Our work shows that the average mole fraction of CO decreases
from the stratosphere to the troposphere and thus strongly advocates for an
external source of CO in Uranus. Photochemical modeling of oxygen species in
the atmosphere of Uranus and more sensitive observations are needed to reveal
the nature of the external source.

eigenfunctions, calculated by the gyrokinetic eigenvalue solver LIGKA
[Lauber'07]. The main aim of these simulations is to allow fast ion loss
measurements to be interpreted with a theoretical basis. Fast particle losses
are modeled and directly compared with experimental measurements
[Garc\'ia-Mu\~noz'10]. The phase space distribution and the mode-correlation
signature of the fast particle losses allows them to be characterized as
prompt, resonant or diffusive (non-resonant). The experimental findings are
reproduced numerically. It is found that a large number of diffuse losses occur
in the lower energy range (at around 1/3 of the birth energy) particularly in
multiple mode scenarios (with different mode frequencies), due to a phase space
overlap of resonances leading to a so-called domino [Berk'95] transport
process. In inverted q profile equilibria, the combination of radially extended
global modes and large particle orbits leads to losses with energies down to
1/10th of the birth energy.

describe such a distribution, as well as to infer the role of urban form in it.
In order to do that, it is proposed, firstly, a method to describe urban form
from its smallest components up to the different urban fabric patches, to the
entire spatial system, and second, a model to represent social interaction as a

discrepancies attributed to end-plate effects. In this paper we numerically
simulate TC flow with axially periodic boundary conditions to explore the
existence of sub-critical transitions to turbulence when no end-plates are
present. We start the simulations with a fully turbulent state in the unstable
regime and enter the linearly stable regime by suddenly starting a
(stabilizing) outer cylinder rotation. The shear Reynolds number of the
turbulent initial state is up to $Re_s \sim10^5$ and the radius ratio is
$\eta=0.714$. The stabilization causes the system to behave as a damped
oscillator and correspondingly the turbulence decays. The evolution of the
torque and turbulent kinetic energy is analysed and the periodicity and damping
of the oscillations are quantified and explained as a function of shear
Reynolds number. Though the initially turbulent flow state decays,
surprisingly, the system is found to absorb energy during this decay.

matter particles may represent ideal gas of non-interacting particles.
Self-interacting dark matter weakly or superweakly coupled to ordinary matter
is also possible, reflecting nontrivial pattern of particle symmetry in the
hidden sector of particle theory. In the early Universe the structure of
particle symmetry breaking gives rise to cosmological phase transitions, from
which macroscopic cosmological defects or primordial nonlinear structures can
be originated. Primordial black holes (PBHs) can be not only a candidate for
dark matter, but also represent a universal probe for super-high energy physics
in the early Universe. Evaporating PBHs turn to be a source of even superweakly
interacting particles, while clouds of massive PBHs can serve as a nonlinear
seeds for galaxy formation. The observed broken symmetry of the three known
families may provide a simultaneous solution for the problems of the mass of
neutrino and strong CP violation in the unique framework of models of
horizontal unification. The existence of new stable charged leptons and quarks
is possible, hidden in elusive ""dark atoms"". Such possibility, strongly
restricted by the constraints on anomalous isotopes of light elements, is not
excluded in scenarios that predict stable double charged particles. The

these low dimensional moderators can also deliver much enhanced cold neutron
brightness in fission reactor neutron sources, compared to much more voluminous
liquid D2 or H2 moderators currently used. Neutronic simulation calculations

simulation of their electromagnetic properties is very desirable in the design
and optimization processes. For many applications, when symmetries allow it,
simple models consisting of 1D or 2D representations are well suited for
providing a satisfying description of the problem at hand. However, certain
designs such as racetrack coils and finite-length or non-straight stacks, do
pose a 3D problem that cannot be easily reduced to a 2D configuration. Full 3-D
models have been developed, but their use for simulating superconducting

problem. In this work, we present a new method to simulate the electromagnetic
transient behavior of 2G HTS stacks and coils. The method, originally used to
model stacks of straight superconducting tapes or circular coils in 2D, is now
extended to 3D. The main idea is to construct an anisotropic bulklike
equivalent for the stack or coil, such that the geometrical layout of the
internal alternating structures of insulating, metallic, superconducting and

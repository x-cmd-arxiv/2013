paper. In the first part we give some examples and we obtain a
Newlander-Nirenberg type theorem on almost complex Lie algebroids. Next the
almost Hermitian Lie algebroids and some related structures on the associated
complex Lie algebroid are studied. For instance, we obtain that the $E$-Chern
form of $E^{1,0}$ associated to an almost complex connection $\nabla$ on $E$
can be expressed in terms of the matrix $J_ER$, where $J_E$ is the almost
complex structure of $E$ and $R$ is the curvature of $\nabla$. Also, we
consider a metric product connection associated to an almost Hermitian Lie
algebroid and we prove that the mean curvature section of $E^{0,1}$ vanishes
and the second fundamental $2$--form section of $E^{0,1}$ vanishes iff the Lie
algebroid is Hermitian.

there exist solutions of the wave equation on a general globally hyperbolic
Lorentzian manifold whose energy is localised along a given null geodesic for a
finite, but arbitrarily long time. In this paper, we show that the energy of
such a localised solution is determined by the energy of the underlying null
geodesic. This result opens the door to various applications of Gaussian beams
on Lorentzian manifolds that do not admit a globally timelike Killing vector
field. In particular we show that trapping in the exterior of Kerr or at the
horizon of an extremal Reissner-Nordstr\""om black hole necessarily leads to a
`loss of derivative' in a local energy decay statement. We also demonstrate the
obstruction formed by the red-shift effect at the event horizon of a
Schwarzschild black hole to scattering constructions from the future (where the
red-shift turns into a blue-shift): we construct solutions to the backwards
problem whose energies grow exponentially for a finite, but arbitrarily long
time. Finally, we give a simple mathematical realisation of the heuristics for
the blue-shift effect near the Cauchy horizon of sub-extremal and extremal
black holes: we construct a sequence of solutions to the wave equation whose
initial energies are uniformly bounded, whereas the energy near the Cauchy
horizon goes to infinity.

disordered interface, we find that a small percentage (on the order of ~10%) of
the atomic sites in the first few monolayers on the silicon side of the
interface are energetically favourable for segregation, and that this is
controlled by the local bonding and local strain of the defect centre. We also
find that there is a long-range quantum confinement effect due to the

this barrier is small in comparison to the effect of the local environment.
Finally, we consider the extent to which the energetics of segregation can be

reduces inter-node communications and is more efficient compared to a flat MPI
parallelization. A strong scaling study shows that the hybrid code maintains
very good scalability up to more than 20000 processor cores and thus allows to
perform simulations at higher resolutions than previously feasible, and opens

can be investigated with Navier-Stokes equations if we take suitable boundary
conditions into account. The aim of this paper is to study the statics and
dynamics of liquids in nanotubes by using methods of non-linear continuum
mechanics. We assume that the nanotube is filled with only a liquid phase; by
using a second gradient theory the static profile of the liquid density in the
tube is analytically obtained and compared with the profile issued from
molecular dynamics simulation. Inside the tube there are two domains: a thin
layer near the solid wall where the liquid density is non-uniform and a central
core where the liquid density is uniform. In the dynamic case a closed form
analytic solution seems to be no more possible, but by a scaling argument it is
shown that, in the tube, two distinct domains connected at their frontiers
still exist. The thin inhomogeneous layer near the solid wall can be
interpreted in relation with the Navier length when the liquid slips on the
boundary as it is expected by experiments and molecular dynamics calculations.

investigates CTQEC based on continuous weak measurements and feedback from the
point of view of the subsystem principle, which states that protected quantum
information is contained in a subsystem of the Hilbert space. We study how to
approach the problem of constructing CTQEC protocols by looking at the
evolution of the state of the system in an encoded basis in which the subsystem
containing the protected information is explicit. This point of view allows us
to reduce the problem to that of protecting a known state, and to design CTQEC
procedures from protocols for the protection of a single qubit. We show how
previously studied CTQEC schemes with both direct and indirect feedback can be
obtained from strategies for the protection of a single qubit via weak
measurements and weak unitary operations. We also review results on the
performance of CTQEC with direct feedback in cases of Markovian and
non-Markovian decoherence, where we have shown that due to the existence of a
Zeno regime in non-Markovian dynamics, the performance of CTQEC can exhibit a
quadratic improvement if the time resolution of the weak error-correcting
operations is high enough to reveal the non-Markovian character of the noise
process.

coupling between the solid and liquid components of a neutron star through {\em
thermally-activated vortex slippage}, and calculate the the response to a spin
glitch. The treatment begins with a derivation of the vortex velocity from the
vorticity equations of motion. The activation energy for vortex slippage is
obtained from a detailed study of the mechanics and energetics of vortex
motion. I show that the ""linear creep"" regime introduced by Alpar et al. and
invoked in fits to post-glitch response is not realized for physically
reasonable parameters, a conclusion that strongly constrains the physics of
post-glitch response through thermal activation. Moreover, a regime of
""superweak pinning"", crucial to the theory of Alpar et al. and its extensions,
is probably precluded by thermal fluctuations. The theory given here has a
robust conclusion that can be tested by observations: {\em for a glitch in spin
rate of magnitude $\Delta\nu$, pinning introduces a delay in the post-glitch
response time}. The delay time is $t_d=7
(t_{sd}/10^4\mbox{yr})((\Delta\nu/\nu)/10^{-6})$ d where $t_{sd}$ is the
spin-down age; $t_d$ is typically weeks for the Vela pulsar and months in older
pulsars, and is independent of the details of vortex pinning. Post-glitch
response through thermal activation cannot occur more quickly than this
timescale. Quicker components of post-glitch response as have been observed in
some pulsars, notably, the Vela pulsar, cannot be due to thermally-activated
vortex motion but must represent a different process, such as drag on vortices
in regions where there is no pinning. I also derive the mutual friction force
for a pinned superfluid at finite temperature for use in other studies of
neutron star hydrodynamics.

must be able to predict certain aspects of its environment in order to survive

estimating the consequences of possible actions, so that planning, control, and
decision-making become feasible. For scientific purposes, such models are
usually created in a problem specific manner using differential equations and
other techniques from control- and system-theory. In contrast to that, we aim
for an unsupervised approach that builds up the desired model in a
self-organized fashion. Inspired by Slow Feature Analysis (SFA), our approach
is to extract sub-signals from the input, that behave as predictable as
possible. These ""predictable features"" are highly relevant for modeling,
because predictability is a desired property of the needed
consequence-estimating model by definition. In our approach, we measure
predictability with respect to a certain prediction model. We focus here on the
solution of the arising optimization problem and present a tractable algorithm
based on algebraic methods which we call Predictable Feature Analysis (PFA). We
prove that the algorithm finds the globally optimal signal, if this signal can
be predicted with low error. To deal with cases where the optimal signal has a
significant prediction error, we provide a robust, heuristically motivated
variant of the algorithm and verify it empirically. Additionally, we give
formal criteria a prediction-model must meet to be suitable for measuring
predictability in the PFA setting and also provide a suitable default-model
along with a formal proof that it meets these criteria.

the design of a resource allocation algorithm minimizing the total transmit

from radio frequency signals. Our design advocates the dual use of both
artificial noise and energy signals in providing secure communication and
facilitating efficient wireless energy transfer. The algorithm design is
formulated as a non-convex optimization problem. The problem formulation takes
into account artificial noise and energy signal generation for protecting the
transmitted information against both considered types of eavesdroppers when
imperfect channel state information (CSI) of the potential eavesdroppers and no
CSI of the passive eavesdroppers are available at the transmitter. In light of
the intractability of the problem, we reformulate the considered problem by
replacing a non-convex probabilistic constraint with a convex deterministic
constraint. Then, a semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxation approach is
adopted to obtain the optimal solution for the reformulated problem.
Furthermore, we propose a suboptimal resource allocation scheme with low
computational complexity for providing communication secrecy and facilitating
efficient energy transfer. Simulation results demonstrate a close-to-optimal
performance achieved by the proposed schemes and significant transmit power
savings by optimization of the artificial noise and energy signal generation.

models for cluster analysis of complex networks, clusters are defined as groups
of nodes with statistically similar link probabilities within and between
groups. A recent extension by Karrer and Newman incorporates a node degree
correction to model degree heterogeneity within each group. Although this
demonstrably leads to better performance on several networks it is not obvious
whether modelling node degree is always appropriate or necessary. We formulate
the degree corrected stochastic blockmodel as a non-parametric Bayesian model,
incorporating a parameter to control the amount of degree correction which can
then be inferred from data. Additionally, our formulation yields principled
ways of inferring the number of groups as well as predicting missing links in
the network which can be used to quantify the model's predictive performance.
On synthetic data we demonstrate that including the degree correction yields
better performance both on recovering the true group structure and predicting
missing links when degree heterogeneity is present, whereas performance is on
par for data with no degree heterogeneity within clusters. On seven real
networks (with no ground truth group structure available) we show that
predictive performance is about equal whether or not degree correction is
included; however, for some networks significantly fewer clusters are
discovered when correcting for degree indicating that the data can be more
compactly explained by clusters of heterogenous degree nodes.

tunneling is strongly suppressed by the layer-dependent Aharonov-Bohm phases
experienced by composite fermions as they propagate through the fluctuating
gauge fields in the system. This suppression is analyzed by treating these
gauge fluctuations within the random-phase approximation and calculating their
contribution to the energy cost for forming an exciton condensate of composite
fermions. This energy cost leads to (1) an increase in the critical interlayer
repulsion needed to drive the transition; and (2) a discontinuous jump in the
energy gaps to out-of-phase excitations (i.e., excitations involving currents
with opposite signs in the two layers) at the transition.

new tool to probe quantum spacetime in different quantum gravity approaches, we
introduce a novel dimensional estimator, the causal spectral dimension, based

inclusive approach by highlighting some problematic assumptions that still lead
to an impoverished conception of the phenomenon of life. In particular, we
argue that the new consensus has so far failed to consider the relevance of
intermediate timescales. We propose that an adequate theory of life must
account for the fact that all living beings are situated in at least four
distinct timescales, which are typically associated with metabolism, motility,
development, and evolution. On this view, self-movement, adaptive behavior and
morphological changes could have already been present at the origin of life. In
order to illustrate this possibility we analyze a minimal model of life-like
phenomena, namely of precarious, individuated, dissipative structures that can
be found in simple reaction-diffusion systems. Based on our analysis we suggest
that processes in intermediate timescales could have already been operative in
prebiotic systems. They may have facilitated and constrained changes occurring
in the faster- and slower-paced timescales of chemical self-individuation and
evolution by natural selection, respectively.

because of the fragile nature of quantum information. In QEC, information is
redundantly stored in a large Hilbert space and one or more observables must be
monitored to reveal the occurrence of an error, without disturbing the
information encoded in an unknown quantum state. Such observables, typically
multi-qubit parities such as <XXXX>, must correspond to a special symmetry
property inherent to the encoding scheme. Measurements of these observables, or
error syndromes, must also be performed in a quantum non-demolition (QND) way
and faster than the rate at which errors occur. Previously, QND measurements of
quantum jumps between energy eigenstates have been performed in systems such as
trapped ions, electrons, cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), nitrogen-vacancy
(NV) centers, and superconducting qubits. So far, however, no fast and repeated
monitoring of an error syndrome has been realized. Here, we track the quantum
jumps of a possible error syndrome, the photon number parity of a microwave
cavity, by mapping this property onto an ancilla qubit. This quantity is just
the error syndrome required in a recently proposed scheme for a
hardware-efficient protected quantum memory using Schr\""{o}dinger cat states in
a harmonic oscillator. We demonstrate the projective nature of this measurement
onto a parity eigenspace by observing the collapse of a coherent state onto
even or odd cat states. The measurement is fast compared to the cavity
lifetime, has a high single-shot fidelity, and has a 99.8% probability per
single measurement of leaving the parity unchanged. In combination with the
deterministic encoding of quantum information in cat states realized earlier,
our demonstrated QND parity tracking represents a significant step towards
implementing an active system that extends the lifetime of a quantum bit.

determines the local value of the coupling of the gauge field to the Dirac

$\partial^{\mu}\phi j_\mu = 0$ which implies that the Dirac current cannot have
a component in the direction of the gradient of the scalar field. As a
consequence, if $\phi$ has a soliton behaviour, like defining a bubble that
connects two vacuua, we obtain that the Dirac current cannot have a flux

coding: Huffman (HC) and arithmetic/range coding (AC). The former is much
faster, but approximates probabilities with powers of 2, usually leading to
relatively low compression rates. The latter uses nearly exact probabilities -
easily approaching theoretical compression rate limit (Shannon entropy), but at
cost of much larger computational cost.
  Asymmetric numeral systems (ANS) is a new approach to accurate entropy
coding, which allows to end this trade-off between speed and rate: the recent
implementation [1] provides about $50\%$ faster decoding than HC for 256 size
alphabet, with compression rate similar to provided by AC. This advantage is
due to being simpler than AC: using single natural number as the state, instead
of two to represent a range. Beside simplifying renormalization, it allows to
put the entire behavior for given probability distribution into a relatively
small table: defining entropy coding automaton. The memory cost of such table
for 256 size alphabet is a few kilobytes. There is a large freedom while
choosing a specific table - using pseudorandom number generator initialized
with cryptographic key for this purpose allows to simultaneously encrypt the
data.
  This article also introduces and discusses many other variants of this new
entropy coding approach, which can provide direct alternatives for standard AC,
for large alphabet range coding, or for approximated quasi arithmetic coding.

randomly in an isotropic fluid; its mean squared displacement (MSD) grows
linearly with time $\textit{\tau}$. Brownian motion in an orientationally
ordered fluid, a nematic, is anisotropic, with the MSD being larger along the
axis of molecular orientation, called the director. We show that at short time
scales, the anisotropic diffusion in a nematic becomes also anomalous, with the
MSD growing slower (subdiffusion) and faster (superdiffusion) than
$\textit{\tau}$. The anomalous diffusion occurs at time scales that correspond
to the relaxation times of director deformations around the sphere. Once the
nematic melts, the diffusion becomes normal and isotropic. The experiment shows
that the deformations and fluctuations of long-range orientational order
profoundly influence diffusive regimes.

encoding of the solution to computational problems into the lowest eigenstate
of a Hamiltonian that supports universal adiabatic quantum computation.
Experimental systems are typically limited to restricted forms of 2-body
interactions. Therefore, universal adiabatic quantum computation requires a
method for approximating quantum many-body Hamiltonians up to arbitrary
spectral error using at most 2-body interactions. Hamiltonian gadgets,
introduced around a decade ago, offer the only current means to address this
requirement. Although the applications of Hamiltonian gadgets have steadily
grown since their introduction, little progress has been made in overcoming the
limitations of the gadgets themselves. In this experimentally motivated
theoretical study, we introduce several gadgets which require significantly
more realistic control parameters than similar gadgets in the literature. We
employ analytical techniques which result in a reduction of the resource
scaling as a function of spectral error for the commonly used subdivision, 3-
to 2-body and $k$-body gadgets. Accordingly, our improvements reduce the
resource requirements of all proofs and experimental proposals making use of
these common gadgets. Next, we numerically optimize these new gadgets to
illustrate the tightness of our analytical bounds. Finally, we introduce a new
gadget that simulates a $YY$ interaction term using Hamiltonians containing
only $\{X,Z,XX,ZZ\}$ terms. Apart from possible implications in a theoretical
context, this work could also be useful for a first experimental implementation
of these key building blocks by requiring less control precision without
introducing extra ancillary qubits.

investigate this basic question in this paper for $Dyck(s)$. $Dyck(s)$ is a
fundamental context free grammar representing the language of well-balanced
parentheses with s different types of parentheses and has played a pivotal role
in the development of theory of context free languages. Computing edit distance
to $Dyck(s)$ significantly generalizes string edit distance problem and has
numerous applications ranging from repairing semi-structured documents such as
XML to memory checking, automated compiler optimization, natural language
processing etc.
  In this paper we give the first near-linear time algorithm for edit distance
computation to $Dyck(s)$ that achieves a nontrivial approximation factor of
$O(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\log{OPT}(\log{n})^{\frac{1}{\epsilon}})$ in
$O(n^{1+\epsilon}\log{n})$ time. In fact, given there exists an algorithm for
computing string edit distance on input of size $n$ in $\alpha(n)$ time with
$\beta(n)$-approximation factor, we can devise an algorithm for edit distance
problem to $Dyck(s)$ running in $\tilde{O}(n^{1+\epsilon}+\alpha(n))$ and
achieving an approximation factor of $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\beta(n)\log{OPT})$.
  We show that the framework for efficiently approximating edit distance to
$Dyck(s)$ can be applied to many other languages. We illustrate this by
considering various memory checking languages which comprise of valid
transcripts of stacks, queues, priority queues, double-ended queues etc.
Therefore, any language that can be recognized by these data structures, can

temperatures around and above the transition between the hadronic and the
quark-gluon phases of strongly interacting matter. We obtain a paramagnetic
response that increases in strength with the temperature. We argue that due to
this paramagnetism, chunks of quark-gluon plasma produced in non-central heavy
ion collisions should become elongated along the direction of the magnetic
field. This anisotropy will then contribute to the elliptic flow v_2 observed
in such collisions, in addition to the pressure gradient that is usually taken
into account. We present a simple estimate for the magnitude of this new effect
and a rough comparison to the effect due to the initial collision geometry. We
conclude that the paramagnetic effect might have a significant impact on the
value of v_2.

extraction of features from an image. This detection reduces the amount of
information to be processed, since the redundant information (considered less
relevant) can be unconsidered. The technique of edge detection consists of
determining the points of a digital image whose intensity changes sharply. This
changes are due to the discontinuities of the orientation on a surface for
example. A well known method of edge detection is the Difference of Gaussians
(DoG). The method consists of subtracting two Gaussians, where a kernel has a
standard deviation smaller than the previous one. The convolution between the
subtraction of kernels and the input image results in the edge detection of
this image. This paper introduces a method of extracting edges using DoG with
kernels based on the q-Gaussian probability distribution, derived from the
q-statistic proposed by Constantino Tsallis. To demonstrate the method's
potential, we compare the introduced method with the traditional DoG using
Gaussians kernels. The results showed that the proposed method can extract
edges with more accurate details.

only the massless parts of the spectrum survive. Geometrically they describe
holomorphic maps to spaces of complex null geodesics, known as ambitwistor
spaces. They have the standard critical space--time dimensions of string theory
(26 in the bosonic case and 10 for the superstring). Quantization leads to the
formulae for tree--level scattering amplitudes of massless particles found
recently by Cachazo, He and Yuan. These representations localize the vertex
operators to solutions of the same equations found by Gross and Mende to govern
the behaviour of strings in the limit of high energy, fixed angle scattering.
Here, localization to the scattering equations emerges naturally as a
consequence of working on ambitwistor space. The worldsheet theory suggests a
way to extend these amplitudes to spinor fields and to loop level. We argue
that this family of string theories is a natural extension of the existing
twistor string theories.

handful of NR waveforms with a total length of ~30 cycles, the length being
limited by the computational cost of NR simulations. Here we address the
outstanding problem of the stability of the EOB calibration with respect to the
length of NR waveforms. Performing calibration studies against NR waveforms of
nonspinning black-hole binaries with mass ratios 1, 1.5, 5, and 8, and with a
total length of ~60 cycles, we find that EOB waveforms calibrated against
either 30 or 60 cycles will be indistinguishable by the advanced detectors LIGO
and Virgo when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is below 110. When extrapolating
to a very large number of cycles, using very conservative assumptions, we can
conclude that state-of-the-art nonspinning EOB waveforms of any length are
sufficiently accurate for parameter estimation with advanced detectors when the
SNR is below 20, the mass ratio is below 5 and total mass is above 20 Msun. The
results are not conclusive for the entire parameter space because of current NR

of linear programs needed to represent a given polytope P. In a breakthrough
paper Fiorini et al. [Proceedings of 44th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing
2012, pages 95-106] showed that any linear programming formulation of
maximum-cut must have exponential size. A natural question to ask is whether
one can prove such strong lower bounds for semidefinite programming
formulations. In this paper we take a step towards this goal and we prove
strong lower bounds for a certain class of SDP formulations, namely SDPs over
the Cartesian product of fixed-size positive semidefinite cones. In practice
this corresponds to semidefinite programs with a block-diagonal structure and
where blocks have constant size d. We show that any such extended formulation
of the cut polytope must have exponential size (when d is fixed). The result of
Fiorini et al. for LP formulations is obtained as a special case when d=1. For
blocks of size d=2 the result rules out any small formulations using
second-order cone programming. Our study of SDP lifts over Cartesian product of
fixed-size positive semidefinite cones is motivated mainly from practical
considerations where it is well known that such SDPs can be solved more
efficiently than general SDPs. The proof of our lower bound relies on new
results about the sparsity pattern of certain matrices with small psd rank,
combined with an induction argument inspired from the recent paper by Kaibel

gauge theory is conformal in the quenched/probe approximation. For this case we
calculate the dimensions of the bifundamental mesonic operators. We then
consider magnetization of the D7-branes, which deforms the dual theory by an
irrelevant operator and renders the mesons chiral. The magnetic flux spoils the
conformality of the dual theory, and induces a D3-brane charge that becomes
large in the ultraviolet, where the non-normalizable bifundamental modes are
rapidly divergent. An ultraviolet completion is therefore necessary to
calculate the correlation functions in the chiral case. On the other hand, the
normalizable modes are very well localized in the infrared, leading to new

the algorithm in random order. This natural problem was investigated in various
recent studies motivated, e.g., by online ad allocations and yield management
where rows correspond to resources and columns to requests specifying demands
for resources. Our main contribution is a $1-O(\sqrt{(\log{d})/B})$-competitive
online algorithm, where $d$ denotes the column sparsity, i.e., the maximum
number of resources that occur in a single column, and $B$ denotes the capacity
ratio $B$, i.e., the ratio between the capacity of a resource and the maximum
demand for this resource. In other words, we achieve a $(1 -
\epsilon)$-approximation if the capacity ratio satisfies $B=\Omega((\log
d)/\epsilon^2)$, which is known to be best-possible for any (randomized) online
algorithms.
  Our result improves exponentially on previous work with respect to the
capacity ratio. In contrast to existing results on packing LP problems, our
algorithm does not use dual prices to guide the allocation of resources.
Instead, it simply solves, for each request, a scaled version of the partially
known primal program and randomly rounds the obtained fractional solution to
obtain an integral allocation for this request. We show that this simple
algorithmic technique is not restricted to packing LPs with large capacity
ratio: We prove an upper bound on the competitive ratio of
$\Omega(d^{-1/(B-1)})$, for any $B \ge 2$. In addition, we show that our
approach can be combined with VCG payments and obtain an incentive compatible
$(1-\epsilon)$-competitive mechanism for packing LPs with $B=\Omega((\log

theories. It pertains to low-acceleration, isolated systems of pointlike

sum_p r_p.F_p=-(2/3)(Ga0)^{1/2}[(\sum_p m_p)^{3/2}-\sum_p m_p^{3/2}]; a0 is the
MOND acceleration constant. Here I show that this relation holds in the
nonrelativistic limit of any modified-gravity MOND theory. It follows from only
the basic tenets of MOND (as applied to such theories): departure from standard
dynamics at accelerations below a0, and space-time scale invariance in the
nonrelativistic, low-acceleration limit. This implies space-dilatation
invariance of the static, gravitational-field equations, which, in turn, leads
to the above point-mass virial relation. Thus, the various MOND predictions and
tests based on this relation hold in any modified-gravity MOND theory. Since we
do not know that any of the existing MOND theories point in the right
direction, it is important to identify such predictions that hold in a much
larger class of theories. Among these predictions are the MOND two-body force
for arbitrary masses, and a general mass-velocity-dispersion relation of the
form sigma^2=(2/3)(MGa0)^{1/2}[1-\sum_p (m_p/M)^{3/2}], where M is the total

Sensitivity Analysis to characterize the relationship between input parameters
and observational predictions of semi-analytic models of galaxy formation
coupled to cosmological $N$-body simulations. We show how a sensitivity
analysis can be performed on our chemo-dynamical model, ChemTreeN, to
characterize and quantify its relationship between model input parameters and
predicted observable properties. The result of this analysis provides the user
with information about which parameters are most important and most likely to
affect the prediction of a given observable. It can also be used to simplify
models by identifying input parameters that have no effect on the outputs of
interest. Conversely, it allows us to identify what model parameters can be
most efficiently constrained by the given observational data set. We have
applied this technique to real observational data sets associated with the
Milky Way, such as the luminosity function of satellite galaxies. A statistical
comparison of model outputs and real observables is used to obtain a
""best-fitting"" parameter set. We consider different Milky Way-like dark matter
halos to account for the dependence of the best-fitting parameters selection
process on the underlying merger history of the models. For all formation
histories considered, running ChemTreeN with best-fitting parameters produced
luminosity functions that tightly fit their observed counterpart. However, only
one of the resulting stellar halo models was able to reproduce the observed
stellar halo mass within 40 kpc of the Galactic center. On the basis of this
analysis it is possible to disregard certain models, and their corresponding
merger histories, as good representations of the underlying merger history of

distribution, more specifically the nonlinear matter power spectrum, the halo
mass function, and the halo bias, for which we determine the deviation with
respect to the fiducial $\Lambda$CDM cosmology in the context of both separate
and combined simulations of $f(R)$ MG and massive neutrinos scenarios. Our
results show that while these two extended models separately determine very
prominent and potentially detectable features in all the three statistics, when
we allow them to be simultaneously at work these features are strongly
suppressed, resulting in much weaker deviations from the standard model's
predictions. In particular, when an $f(R)$ gravity model with $f_{R0}=-1\times
10^{-4}$ is combined with a total neutrino mass of $\Sigma _{i}m_{\nu

have performed detailed analyses of brighter RGB stars at higher spectroscopic

metallicity difference between brighter and fainter M4 members is real or is
the result of the low signal-to-noise characteristics of the fainter stars. The
strength of our approach is shown by recovering a metallicity close to a single

CO(1-0) observations of local ULIRGs and QSO hosts: clear signature of massive
and energetic molecular outflows, extending on kpc scales, is found in the
CO(1-0) kinematics of four out of seven sources, with measured outflow rates of
several 100 Msun/yr. We combine these new observations with data from the
literature, and explore the nature and origin of massive molecular outflows
within an extended sample of 19 local galaxies. We find that
starburst-dominated galaxies have an outflow rate comparable to their SFR, or
even higher by a factor of ~ 2-4, implying that starbursts can indeed be
effective in removing cold gas from galaxies. Nevertheless, our results suggest
that the presence of an AGN can boost the outflow rate by a large factor, which
is found to increase with the L_AGN/L_bol ratio. The gas depletion time-scales
due to molecular outflows are anti-correlated with the presence and luminosity
of an AGN in these galaxies, and range from a few hundred million years in
starburst galaxies, down to just a few million years in galaxies hosting
powerful AGNs. In quasar hosts the depletion time-scales due to the outflow are
much shorter than the depletion time-scales due to star formation. We estimate
the outflow kinetic power and find that, for galaxies hosting powerful AGNs, it
corresponds to about 5% of the AGN luminosity, as expected by models of AGN
feedback. Moreover, we find that momentum rates of about 20 L_AGN/c are common
among the AGN-dominated sources in our sample. For ""pure"" starburst galaxies
our data tentatively support models in which outflows are mostly
momentum-driven by the radiation pressure from young stars onto dusty clouds.

10^11 Msun) z~2 star-forming galaxies (SFGs), which are plausibly driven by an
Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). The sample consists of the eight most massive
SFGs from our SINS/zC-SINF survey of galaxy kinematics with the imaging
spectrometer SINFONI, six of which have sensitive high-resolution adaptive
optics (AO) assisted observations. All of the objects are disks hosting a
significant stellar bulge. The spectra in their central regions exhibit a broad
component in Halpha and forbidden [NII] and [SII] line emission, with typical
velocity FWHM ~ 1500 km/s, [NII]/Halpha ratio ~ 0.6, and intrinsic extent of 2
- 3 kpc. These properties are consistent with warm ionized gas outflows
associated with Type 2 AGN, the presence of which is confirmed via independent
diagnostics in half the galaxies. The data imply a median ionized gas mass
outflow rate of ~ 60 Msun/yr and mass loading of ~ 3. At larger radii, a weaker
broad component is detected but with lower FWHM ~ 485 km/s and [NII]/Halpha ~
0.35, characteristic for star formation-driven outflows as found in the
lower-mass SINS/zC-SINF galaxies. The high inferred mass outflow rates and
frequent occurrence suggest the nuclear outflows efficiently expel gas out of
the centers of the galaxies with high duty cycles, and may thus contribute to
the process of star formation quenching in massive galaxies. Larger samples at
high masses will be crucial to confirm the importance and energetics of the
nuclear outflow phenomenon, and its connection to AGN activity and bulge
growth.

to matter-radiation equality and larger (l ~ 2 - 30). Observational systematics
can strongly bias clustering measurements on large scales, which can mimic
cosmologically relevant signals such as deviations from Gaussianity in the
spectrum of primordial perturbations. We account for systematics by employing a
new method recently proposed by Agarwal et al. (2014) to the clustering of
photometrically classified quasars. We carefully apply our methodology to
mitigate known observational systematics and further remove angular bins that
are contaminated by unknown systematics. Combining quasar data with the
photometric luminous red galaxy (LRG) sample of Ross et al. (2011) and Ho et
al. (2012), and marginalizing over all bias and shot noise-like parameters, we

formation and evolution. However, most current models fail to reproduce the
clustering of low-mass galaxies on small scales ($r<1Mpc/h$). In this paper we
study the galaxy clusterings predicted from a few semi-analytical models. We
firstly compare two Munich versions, Guo et al. (2011, Guo11) and De Lucia \&
Blazoit (2007, DLB07). The Guo11 model well reproduces the galaxy stellar mass
function, but over-predicts the clustering of low-mass galaxies on small
scales. The DLB07 model provides a better fit to the clustering on small
scales, but over-predicts the stellar mass function. These seem to be puzzling.
We find that there is slightly more fraction of satellite galaxies residing in
massive haloes in the Guo11 model, which is the dominant contribution to the
clustering discrepancy between the two models. However, both models still
over-predict the clustering at $0.1Mpc/h<r<10Mpc/h$ for low mass galaxies. This
is because both models over-predict the number of satellites by $30\%$ in
massive halos than the data. Actually, the better agreement of DLB07 model with
the data on small scales comes as a coincidence as it predicts too many
low-mass central galaxies which are less clustered and thus bring down the
total clustering. Finally, we show the predictions from the semi-analytical of
Kang et al. (2012). We find that this model can simultaneously fit the stellar
mass function and galaxy clustering if the supernova feedback in satellite
galaxies is stronger. We conclude that semi-analytical models are now able to
solve the small-scales clustering problem, without invoking of any other new
physics or changing the dark matter properties, such as the recent favored warm
dark matter.

star-forming galaxies, and their strong correlation with bright ultraviolet
regions within their host galaxies. Short GRBs have long been suspected on
theoretical grounds to arise from compact object binary mergers (NS-NS or

insight into their energy scale and environments, established a cosmological
origin, a mix of host galaxy types, and an absence of associated supernovae. In
this review I summarize nearly a decade of short GRB afterglow and host galaxy
observations, and use this information to shed light on the nature and
properties of their progenitors, the energy scale and collimation of the
relativistic outflow, and the properties of the circumburst environments. The
preponderance of the evidence points to compact object binary progenitors,

galaxies (K-selected, star-forming sBzK galaxies, extremely red objects and
distant red galaxies) according to their optical/NIR fluxes. We find clear,
>10-sigma detections in the stacked images of all these galaxy classes. We
include in our stacking analysis Herschel/SPIRE data to constrain the dust SED
of these galaxies. We find that their dust emission is well described by a
modified black body with Tdust~30 K and beta=1.6 and IR luminosities of
(5-11)x10^{11} Lsun, or implied star formation rates of 75-140 Msun/yr. We

sources individually detected in ALESS maps. We report a similar discrepancy by
repeating our analysis on 1.4\,GHz observations of the whole ECDFS. Hence we

Crab Nebula has attracted new interest in alternative particle acceleration
mechanisms in pulsar wind nebulae. Diffuse shock-acceleration fails to explain
the flares because particle acceleration and emission occur during a single or
even sub-Larmor timescale. In this regime, the synchrotron energy losses induce
a drag force on the particle motion that balances the electric acceleration and
prevents the emission of synchrotron radiation above 160 MeV. Previous
analytical studies and 2D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations indicate that
relativistic reconnection is a viable mechanism to circumvent the above
difficulties. The reconnection electric field localized at X-points linearly
accelerates particles with little radiative energy losses. In this paper, we
check whether this mechanism survives in 3D, using a set of large PIC
simulations with radiation reaction force and with a guide field. In agreement
with earlier works, we find that the relativistic drift kink instability
deforms and then disrupts the layer, resulting in significant plasma heating
but few non-thermal particles. A moderate guide field stabilizes the layer and
enables particle acceleration. We report that 3D magnetic reconnection can
accelerate particles above the standard radiation reaction limit, although the
effect is less pronounced than in 2D with no guide field. We confirm that the
highest energy particles form compact bunches within magnetic flux ropes, and a
beam tightly confined within the reconnection layer, which could result in the
observed Crab flares when, by chance, the beam crosses our line of sight.

of waves of neural activity in each layer is affected by the coupling. Synaptic
connectivities within and between each layer are determined by integral kernels
of an integrodifferential equation describing the temporal evolution of neural
activity. Excitatory neural fields, with purely positive connectivities,
support traveling fronts in each layer, whose speeds are increased when
coupling between layers is considered. Studying the effects of noise, we find
coupling also serves to reduce the variance in the position of traveling
fronts, as long as the noise sources to each layer are not completely
correlated. Neural fields with asymmetric connectivity support traveling pulses
whose speeds are decreased by interlaminar coupling. Again, coupling reduces
the variance in traveling pulse position, when noise is considered that is not
totally correlated between layers. To derive our stochastic results, we employ
a small-noise expansion, also assuming interlaminar connectivity scales
similarly. Our asymptotic results agree reasonably with accompanying numerical

prescribed by the Bohmian formulation of quantum mechanics. But, what happens
if the same experiment is repeated assuming that the wave function associated
with each particle is different, i.e., in the case of mixed (incoherent)
states? This question is investigated here by means of two alternative
numerical simulations of Young's experiment, purposely devised to be easily
implemented and tested in the laboratory. Contrary to what could be expected a
priori, it is found that even for conditions of maximal mixedness or
incoherence (total lack of interference fringes), experimental data will render
a puzzling and challenging outcome: the average particle trajectories will
still display features analogous to those for pure states, i.e., independently
of how mixedness arises, the associated dynamics is influenced by both slits at
the same time. Physically this simply means that weak measurements are not able

inhomogeneous jet model with an accelerating, magnetically dominated, parabolic
base transitioning to a slowly decelerating, conical section motivated by
observations, simulations and theory. We set the inner geometry of our
multi-zone model using observations of the jet in M87 which transitions from
parabolic to conical at 10^5 Schwarzschild radii. This model is able to
reproduce quiescent blazar spectra very well across all wavelengths (including
radio observations) for a sample of 42 BL Lacs and FSRQs.
  Using this inhomogeneous model we are able to constrain the location at which
the synchrotron emission is brightest in these jets by fitting to the optically
thick to thin synchrotron break. We find that the radius of the jet at which
the synchrotron emission is brightest (where the jet first approaches
equipartition) scales approximately linearly with the jet power. We also find a
correlation between the length of the accelerating, parabolic section of the
jet and the maximum bulk Lorentz factor. In agreement with previous work we
find that BL Lacs are low power blazars whereas FSRQs are high power blazars.
Together with our simple jet power-radius relation this leads us to a deeper
understanding of the physics underlying the blazar sequence.

goal of this paper is to set up the foundations of a microscopic theory to
study the static aspects of induced fission as a function of the excitation

the high excitation energy of the compound nucleus, we employ a statistical
approach based on finite-temperature nuclear density functional theory with
Skyrme energy densities, which we benchmark on the 239 Pu(n,f) reaction. We
compute the evolution of the least-energy fission pathway across
multidimensional potential energy surfaces with up to five collective variables
as a function of the nuclear temperature, and predict the evolution of both the
inner and outer fission barriers as a function of the excitation energy of the
compound nucleus. We show that the coupling to the continuum induced by the
finite temperature is negligible in the range of neutron energies relevant for
many applications of neutron-induced fission. We prove that the concept of
quantum localization introduced recently can be extended to T > 0, and we apply
the method to study the interaction energy and total kinetic energy of fission
fragments as a function of the temperature for the most probable fission. While
large uncertainties in theoretical modeling remain, we conclude that
finite-temperature nuclear density functional may provide a useful framework to
obtain accurate predictions of fission fragment properties.

biomedical research, as it allows the quantification of a multitude of
parameters at the cellular level. However, manual counting of these images is
both tiring and unreliable and ultimately very time-consuming for biomedical
researchers. Not only does this slow down the overall research process, it also
introduces counting errors due to a lack of objectivity and consistency
inherent to the researchers own human nature.
  This thesis addresses this issue by automatically determining infection
indexes of macrophages parasite by Leishmania in microscopy images using
computer vision and pattern recognition methodologies. Initially images are
submitted to a pre-processing stage that consists in a normalization of
illumination conditions. Three algorithms are then applied in parallel to each
image. Algorithm A intends to detect macrophage nuclei and consists of
segmentation via adaptive multi-threshold, and classification of resulting
regions using a set of collected features. Algorithm B intends to detect
parasites and is similar to Algorithm A but the adaptive multi-threshold is
parameterized with a different constraints vector. Algorithm C intends to
detect the macrophages and parasites cytoplasm and consists of a cut-off
version of the previous two algorithms, where the classification step is
skipped. Regions with multiple nuclei or parasites are processed by a voting
system that employs both a Support Vector Machine and a set of region features
for determining the number of objects present in each region. The previous vote
is then taken into account as the number of mixtures to be used in a Gaussian
Mixture Model to decluster the said region. Finally each parasite is assigned
to, at most, a single macrophage using minimum Euclidean distance to a cell
nucleus, thus quantifying Leishmania infection levels.

1.6 in the SXDS/UDS fields with M_{*} > 10^{9.5} M_{\sun}, and expected
F(H\alpha) > 5 \times 10^{-17} erg s^{-1} cm^{-2}. Among the observed ~1200
targets, 343 objects show significant H\alpha emission lines. The gas-phase
metallicity is obtained from [NII]\lambda 6584/H\alpha line ratio, after
excluding possible active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Due to the faintness of the
[NII]\lambda 6584 lines, we apply the stacking analysis and derive the
mass-metallicity relation at z~1.4. Our results are compared to past results at
different redshifts in the literature. The mass-metallicity relation at z~1.4
is located between those at z~0.8 and z~2.2; it is found that the metallicity
increases with decreasing redshift from z~3 to z~0 at fixed stellar mass.
Thanks to the large size of the sample, we can study the dependence of the
mass-metallicity relation on various galaxy physical properties. The average
metallicity from the stacked spectra is close to the local FMR in the higher
metallicity part but >0.1 dex higher in metallicity than the FMR in the lower
metallicity part. We find that galaxies with larger E(B-V), B-R, and R-H
colours tend to show higher metallicity by ~0.05 dex at fixed stellar mass. We
also find relatively clearer size dependence that objects with smaller half
light radius tend to show higher metallicity by ~0.1 dex at fixed stellar mass,
especially in the low mass part.

tractable. However, large $n$ player interactions are more realistically
modeled as games of incomplete information, where players may know little to
nothing about the types of other players. Unfortunately, games in incomplete
information settings lose many of the nice properties of complete information
games: the quality of equilibria can become worse, the equilibria lose their
ex-post properties, and coordinating on an equilibrium becomes even more
difficult. Because of these problems, we would like to study games of
incomplete information, but still implement equilibria of the complete
information game induced by the (unknown) realized player types.
  This problem was recently studied by Kearns et al. and solved in large games
by means of introducing a weak mediator: their mediator took as input reported
types of players, and output suggested actions which formed a correlated
equilibrium of the underlying game. Players had the option to play
independently of the mediator, or ignore its suggestions, but crucially, if
they decided to opt-in to the mediator, they did not have the power to lie
about their type. In this paper, we rectify this deficiency in the setting of
large congestion games. We give, in a sense, the weakest possible mediator: it
cannot enforce participation, verify types, or enforce its suggestions.
Moreover, our mediator implements a Nash equilibrium of the complete
information game. We show that it is an (asymptotic) ex-post equilibrium of the
incomplete information game for all players to use the mediator honestly, and
that when they do so, they end up playing an approximate Nash equilibrium of
the induced complete information game. In particular, truthful use of the
mediator is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium in any Bayesian game for any prior.

nonthermal synchrotron components. Eight galaxies with four-sub-band detections
had steep spectra that were only fit by a single nonthermal component. Using
these fits, we calculated supernova rates, total number of equivalent O stars,
and star formation rates within each ~23 arcsecond beam. For unresolved
galaxies, these physical properties characterize the galaxies' recent star
formation on a global scale. We confirm that the radio-far-infrared correlation
holds for the unresolved galaxies' total 33 GHz flux regardless of their
thermal fractions, though the scatter on this correlation is larger than that
at 1.4 GHz. In addition, we found that for the unresolved galaxies, there is an
inverse relationship between the ratio of 33 GHz flux to total far-infrared
flux and the steepness of the galaxy's spectral index between 1.4 GHz and 33

degrade the performance of communication systems. The vast majority of
technical contributions in the area of relaying neglect hardware impairments
and, thus, assumes ideal hardware. Such approximations make sense in low-rate
systems, but can lead to very misleading results when analyzing future
high-rate systems. This paper quantifies the impact of hardware impairments on
dual-hop relaying, for both amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward
protocols. The outage probability (OP) in these practical scenarios is a
function of the effective end-to-end signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio
(SNDR). This paper derives new closed-form expressions for the exact and
asymptotic OPs, accounting for hardware impairments at the source, relay, and
destination. A similar analysis for the ergodic capacity is also pursued,
resulting in new upper bounds. We assume that both hops are subject to
independent but non-identically distributed Nakagami-m fading. This paper
validates that the performance loss is small at low rates, but otherwise can be
very substantial. In particular, it is proved that for high signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR), the end-to-end SNDR converges to a deterministic constant, coined
the SNDR ceiling, which is inversely proportional to the level of impairments.
This stands in contrast to the ideal hardware case in which the end-to-end SNDR
grows without bound in the high-SNR regime. Finally, we provide fundamental
design guidelines for selecting hardware that satisfies the requirements of a
practical relaying system.

nontrivially affect neuronal dynamics, it is unknown whether ion-channel noise
is strong enough to act as a noise source for hypothesised noise-enhanced
information processing in real neuronal systems, i.e. 'stochastic
facilitation.' Here, we demonstrate that biophysical models of channel noise
can give rise to two kinds of recently discovered stochastic facilitation
effects in a Hodgkin-Huxley-like model of auditory brainstem neurons. The
first, known as slope-based stochastic resonance (SBSR), enables phasic neurons
to emit action potentials that can encode the slope of inputs that vary slowly
relative to key time-constants in the model. The second, known as inverse
stochastic resonance (ISR), occurs in tonically firing neurons when small
levels of noise inhibit tonic firing and replace it with burst-like dynamics.
Consistent with previous work, we conclude that channel noise can provide
significant variability in firing dynamics, even for large numbers of channels.
Moreover, our results show that possible associated computational benefits may
occur due to channel noise in neurons of the auditory brainstem. This holds
whether the firing dynamics in the model are phasic (SBSR can occur due to
channel noise) or tonic (ISR can occur due to channel noise).

central interdisciplinary challenge. Cooperation is most difficult to explain
in the Prisoner's Dilemma game, where cooperators always lose in direct
competition with defectors despite increasing mean fitness. Here we demonstrate
how spatial population expansion, a widespread natural phenomenon, promotes the
evolution of cooperation. We engineer an experimental Prisoner's Dilemma game
in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to show that, despite losing to
defectors in nonexpanding conditions, cooperators increase in frequency in
spatially expanding populations. Fluorescently labeled colonies show genetic
demixing of cooperators and defectors, followed by increase in cooperator
frequency as cooperator sectors overtake neighboring defector sectors. Together
with lattice-based spatial simulations, our results suggest that spatial
population expansion drives the evolution of cooperation by (1) increasing
positive genetic assortment at population frontiers and (2) selecting for
phenotypes maximizing local deme productivity. Spatial expansion thus creates a
selective force whereby cooperator-enriched demes overtake neighboring
defector-enriched demes in a ""survival of the fastest"". We conclude that colony
growth alone can promote cooperation and prevent defection in microbes. Our
results extend to other species with spatially restricted dispersal undergoing
range expansion, including pathogens, invasive species, and humans.

cardinal $\leq\mathrm{card}(X)$, and $F$ the set of complements in $X$ of
subsets of cardinality $<\kappa$, then the above criterion holds.
  We then give some negative examples, including a countable downward directed
set $F$ of subsets of $\mathbb{Z}$ not of the above sort which satisfies the

The design and transmission of those signaling, especially the over-the-air

OTA signaling in cellular networks to provide insights on the design of OTA
signaling. Specifically, we first give a brief introduction of the OTA
signaling in long term evolution (LTE), and then we discuss the challenges and
requirements in designing the OTA signaling in cellular networks in detail. To
better understand the OTA signaling, we give two important classifications of
OTA signaling and address their properties and applications. Finally, we
propose a signature-based signaling named (single-tone signaling, STS) which
can be used for inter-cell OTA signaling and is especially useful and robust in
multi-signal scenario. Simulation results are given to compare the detection

relatively small at $\Delta \sim 5$ MeV, the signal-to-noise ratio for Advanced

regulates the Ca$^{2+}$ influx from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the
cytoplasm. A thorough study of the IPR channel contributes to a better
understanding of calcium oscillations and waves. It has long been observed that
the IPR channel is a typical biological system which performs adaptation.
However, recent advances on the physical essence of adaptation show that
adaptation systems with a negative feedback mechanism, such as the IPR channel,
must break detailed balance and always operate out of equilibrium with energy
dissipation. Almost all previous IPR models are equilibrium models assuming
detailed balance and thus violate the physical essence of adaptation. In this
article, we constructed a nonequilibrium allosteric model of single IPR
channels based on the patch-clamp experimental data obtained from the IPR in
the outer membranes of isolated nuclei of the \emph{Xenopus} oocyte. It turns
out that our model reproduces the patch-clamp experimental data reasonably well
and produces both the correct steady-state and dynamic properties of the
channel. Particularly, our model successfully describes the complicated bimodal
[Ca$^{2+}$] dependence of the mean open duration at high [IP$_3$], a
steady-state behavior which fails to be correctly described in previous IPR
models. Finally, we used the patch-clamp experimental data to validate that the
IPR channel indeed breaks detailed balance and thus is a nonequilibrium system
which consumes energy.

takes multiple observed social networks as input and returns an integrated
global social graph where each node corresponds to a real person. The key
challenge for social network integration is to discover the correspondences or
interlinks across different social networks.
  We engaged an in-depth analysis across three online social networks, AMiner,
Linkedin, and Videolectures in order to address what reveals users' social
identity, whether the social factors consistent across different social
networks and how we can leverage these information to perform integration.
  We proposed a unified framework for the social network integration task. It
crawls data from multiple social networks and further discovers accounts

probabilistic model to determine such correspondence, it incorporates features
like the consistency of social status and social ties across different, as well
as one-to-one mapping constraint and logical transitivity to jointly make the
prediction. Empirical experiments verify the effectiveness of our method.

attention from statistics, physics and computer science. However, most
clustering algorithms assume knowledge of the number of clusters k. In this
paper we propose to automatically determine k in a graph generated from a
Stochastic Blockmodel. Our main contribution is twofold; first, we
theoretically establish the limiting distribution of the principal eigenvalue
of the suitably centered and scaled adjacency matrix, and use that distribution
for our hypothesis test. Secondly, we use this test to design a recursive
bipartitioning algorithm. Using quantifiable classification tasks on real world
networks with ground truth, we show that our algorithm outperforms existing
probabilistic models for learning overlapping clusters, and on unlabeled
networks, we show that we uncover nested community structure.

using the Holstein-Primakoff (HP) boson representation of spin operators. Both
the renormalized ground state and the elementary excitations are found by means
of Bogoliubov transformation, as a function of the two variables that can be

Three main results are found. First, because of the non-collinear nature of the
classical ground state, there is a significant zero point reduction of the
ground state magnetization of the spin spiral. Second, the two lowest energy
spin waves are edge modes in the spin spiral state that, above a critical field
the results into a collinear ferromagnetic ground state, become confined bulk

oscillatory behavior as function of the chain length with the same period of

weakens with the increasing of stretching temperature reaching a minima value

its origin of cavitation process during stretching. In this work, the effect of

ultrasmall-angle and wide-angle X-ray scattering techniques. It was found that,
with respect to the cavitation process, three modes of cavitation during the

thinnest lamellae where only shear yielding occurred, cavitation with
reorientation for the samples stretched at lower temperatures and samples with
thicker lamellae, and cavitation without reorientation for samples with thinner
lamellae stretched at higher temperatures. The mode cavitation with
reorientation occurs before yield point where the plate-like cavities start to
be generated within the lamellar stacks with normal perpendicular to the
stretching direction due to the blocky substructure of the crystalline lamellae
and reorient gradually to the stretching direction after strain-hardening. The
mode of cavitation without reorientation appears after yield point where
ellipsoidal shaped cavities are generated in those lamellae stacks with normal

Neumann-Neumann methods for parabolic problems. Like the Dirichlet-Neumann
method for steady problems, the method is based on a non-overlapping spatial
domain decomposition, and the iteration involves subdomain solves with
Dirichlet boundary conditions followed by subdomain solves with Neumann
boundary conditions. For the Neumann-Neumann method, one step of the method
consists of solving the subdomain problems using Dirichlet interface
conditions, followed by a correction step involving Neumann interface
conditions. However, each subdomain problem is now in space and time, and the
interface conditions are also time-dependent. Using Laplace transforms, we show
for the heat equation that when we consider finite time intervals, the
Dirichlet-Neumann and Neumann-Neumann methods converge superlinearly for an
optimal choice of the relaxation parameter, similar to the case of Schwarz
waveform relaxation algorithms. The convergence rate depends on the size of the
subdomains as well as the length of the time window. For any other choice of

series of experiments have been done since 2010, and the preliminary testing
results show that the magnetic property of niobium materials has been changed
with different doping elements and proportions while the superconductive
transition temperature almost does not change. Then a large ingot niobium doped

  Aims. We aim to understand the emission mechanism of He ENA based on
knowledge of heliosheath spatial extent and plasma content resulting from
Voyager 1 & 2 measurements in the period after termination shock crossings.
  Methods. He ENA are generated by charge-exchange neutralization of energetic
helium ions on interstellar neutral H and He. Energy spectra of helium ions in
the heliosheath are calculated by following the evolution of their velocity
distribution functions when carried by and undergoing binary interactions with
plasma constituents of a background flow whose particle populations are modeled
to approximately render post-termination-shock Voyager data.
  Results. The observed HSTOF He ENA form a higher energy part of general
heliospheric He ENA fluxes and can be explained by the proposed mechanism to
within 2{\sigma} error. The main factor determining the level of emission (and
its uncertainty) is the energy spectrum of He^+ pickup ions in post-termination
shock plasmas.

approach to linear stability of pulse-coupled neural networks for generic
phase-response curves and post-synaptic response functions. In particular, we
present: (i) a mean-field approach developed under the hypothesis of an
infinite network and small synaptic conductances; (ii) a ""microscopic"" approach
which applies to finite but large networks. As a result, we find that no matter
how large is a neural network, its response to most of the perturbations
depends on the system size. There exists, however, also a second class of
perturbations, whose evolution typically covers an increasingly wide range of
time scales. The analysis of perfectly regular, asynchronous, states reveals
that their stability depends crucially on the smoothness of both the
phase-response curve and the transmitted post-synaptic pulse. The general
validity of this scenarion is confirmed by numerical simulations of systems
that are not amenable to a perturbative approach.

shapes as those of LO distributions, but their differences are sizable. This
indicates that a NLO calculation is necessary and important to achieve a more
accurate estimation. Due to $Z^0$ boson resonance effect, at the super $Z$

known about their origin, their evolution and their detailed physical
properties. In particular, the relationship between the mass distribution of
these clumps (also known as the ""clump mass function"", or CMF) and the stellar
initial mass function (IMF), is still poorly understood. Aims. In order to
better understand how the CMF evolve toward the IMF, and to discern the ""true""
shape of the CMF, large samples of bona-fide pre- and proto-stellar clumps are
required. Two such datasets obtained from the Herschel infrared GALactic Plane
Survey (Hi-GAL) have been described in paper I. Robust statistical methods are
needed in order to infer the parameters describing the models used to fit the
CMF, and to compare the competing models themselves. Methods. In this paper we
apply Bayesian inference to the analysis of the CMF of the two regions
discussed in Paper I. First, we determine the Bayesian posterior probability
distribution for each of the fitted parameters. Then, we carry out a
quantitative comparison of the models used to fit the CMF. Results. We have
compared the results from several methods implementing Bayesian inference, and
we have also analyzed the impact of the choice of priors and the influence of
various constraints on the statistical conclusions for the preferred values of
the parameters. We find that both parameter estimation and model comparison
depend on the choice of parameter priors. Conclusions. Our results confirm our
earlier conclusion that the CMFs of the two Hi-GAL regions studied here have
very similar shapes but different mass scales. Furthermore, the lognormal model
appears to better describe the CMF measured in the two Hi-GAL regions studied
here. However, this preliminary conclusion is dependent on the choice of
parameters priors.

used to train a DNN. In the separation stage, the trained DNN is utilized to
aid in estimation of each source in the mixed signal. Single channel source
separation problem is formulated as an energy minimization problem where each
source spectra estimate is encouraged to fit the trained DNN model and the
mixed signal spectrum is encouraged to be written as a weighted sum of the
estimated source spectra. The proposed approach works regardless of the energy
scale differences between the source signals in the training and separation

Cartan distributions on jet spaces provide canonical examples. More generally,
I define higher codimensional versions of pre-contact structures as
distributions on manifolds whose characteristic symmetries span a constant
dimensional distribution. I call them pre-multicontact structures. Every
distribution is almost everywhere, locally, a pre-multicontact structure. After
showing that the standard symplectization of contact manifolds generalizes
naturally to a (pre-)multisymplectization of (pre-)multicontact manifolds, I
make use of results by C. Rogers and M. Zambon to associate a canonical
$L_{\infty}$-algebra to any (pre-)multicontact structure. Such
$L_{\infty}$-algebra is a multicontact version of the Jacobi bracket on a
contact manifold. However, unlike the multisymplectic $L_\infty$-algebra of
Rogers and Zambon, the multicontact $L_\infty$-algebra is always a homological
resolution of a Lie algebra. Finally, I describe in local coordinates the
$L_{\infty}$-algebra associated to the Cartan distribution on jet spaces.

variants of Au nanoparticles, close packed (4-6nm), well dispersed (120-150nm)

Nano-microstructure, morphology, topography and phase shift of both WS2 and Au
nanoparticles and nanoparticulates were characterized by Atomic Force
Microscopy (AFM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron
Microscopy (TEM). SEM and TEM observations showed that the nanoparticulates of
WS2 are atomically oriented lamellar-hexagonal structure or inorganic graphite
like structure. In the tapping mode AFM imaging, repeated scanning of
nanoparticulates of WS2 resulted in inter layer movement of nanolayers. It was
observed that cluster of Au nanoparticles caused more phase shift and high
energy dissipation compared to that of well dispersed Au nanoparticles, however
close packed Au nanoparticles caused lowest phase shift and energy dissipation.
Nano-microstructure, morphology, topography and phase shift were analyzed by
SXM software. The nanoscale studies showed that the phase shift and the energy
dissipation were influenced by the geometrical and mechanical gradient of the
samples.

the same title of this text) delivered by the authors in the Bedlewo school
""Modern Dynamics and its Interaction with Analysis, Geometry and Number Theory""

  In the first part of this text, i.e., from Sections 1 to 5, we discuss the
Teichm\""uller and moduli space of translation surfaces, the Teichm\""uller flow
and the SL(2,R)-action on these moduli spaces and the Kontsevich-Zorich cocycle
over the Teichm\""uller geodesic flow. We sketch two applications of the ergodic
properties of the Teichm\""uller flow and Kontsevich-Zorich cocycle, with
respect to Masur-Veech measures, to the unique ergodicity, deviation of ergodic
averages and weak mixing properties of typical interval exchange
transformations and translation flows. These applications are based on the
fundamental fact that the Teichm\""uller flow and the Kontsevich-Zorich cocycle
work as \emph{renormalization dynamics} for interval exchange transformations
and translation flows.
  In the second part, i.e., from Sections 6 to 9, we start by pointing out that
it is interesting to study the ergodic properties of the Kontsevich-Zorich
cocycle with respect to invariant measures other than the Masur-Veech ones, in
view of potential applications to the investigation of billiards in rational
polygons (for instance). We then study some examples of measures for which the
ergodic properties of the Kontsevich-Zorich cocycle are very different from the
case of Masur-Veech measures. Finally, we end these notes by constructing some
examples of closed SL(2,R)-orbits such that the restriction of the
Teichm\""uller flow to them has arbitrary small rate of exponential mixing, or,
equivalently, the naturally associated unitary SL(2,R)-representations have
arbitrarily small spectral gap (and in particular it has complementary series).

significant anti-correlations between V and dM/dt, the Eddington ratio, and the
bolometric luminosity L, respectively. A weak, statistically not significant
positive trend is indicated for the dependence of V on M. As a side product, we
find a strong correlation of the radiative efficiency with M and show that this
trend is most likely produced by selection effects in combination with the mass
errors and the use of the scaling relation for dM/dt. The anti-correlations
found for V cannot be explained in such a way. The strongest anti-correlation
is found with dM/dt. However, it is difficult to decide which of the quantities
(L, Eddington ratio, dM/dt) is intrinsically correlated with V and which of the
observed correlations are produced by the relations between these quantities. A
V-dM/dt anti-correlation is qualitatively expected for the strongly
inhomogeneous accretion disks. We argue that several observed variability
properties are not adequately explained by the simple multi-temperature
black-body model of a standard disk and suggest to check whether the strongly
inhomogeneous disk model is capable of reproducing these observations better.

approach for the clean system, by which pairing correlations between
opposite-spin fermions evolve from the weak-coupling (BCS) to the
strong-coupling (BEC) limits by increasing the strength of the attractive
inter-particle interaction, all possible diagrammatic processes are considered
where the effects of a disordered potential are retained in the self-energy at
the lowest order. An accurate numerical investigation is carried out for all
these diagrammatic terms, to determine which of them are mostly important
throughout the BCS-BEC crossover. Explicit calculations for the values of Tc,
the chemical potential, and the Tan's contact are carried out. In addition, the
effect of disorder on the single-particle spectral function is analyzed, and a
correlation is found between an increase of Tc and a widening of the pseudo-gap
energy at Tc on the BCS side of unitarity in the presence of disorder, while on
the BEC side of unitarity the presence of disorder favors the collapse of the
underlying Fermi surface. The present investigation is meant to orient future
studies when the effects of disorder will be considered at higher orders, with
the purpose of limiting the proliferation of diagrammatic terms in which

must be able to process a very large amount of data in a very limited amount of

rate that can be stored and processed in a reasonable amount of time. This need

problems associated with the standard combinatorial track finding currently
used. The Hough transform is also well-adapted for Graphics Processing Unit
(GPU)-based computing, and such GPU-based systems could be easily integrated
into the existing High-Level Trigger (HLT). This algorithm offers the ability
to trigger on topological signatures of new physics currently not practical to

binary MACHO 82.8043.171 in the Large Magellanic cloud (LMC) were studied in
order to analyse the long-term evolution of its orbit. It is a detached system
that is undergoing rapid orbit precession. The inclination of the orbit towards
the observer has been changing, which has caused the eclipse depth to become
lower over the past decade, and this is ongoing. The period of this effect was
derived as only about 77 years, so it is the second fastest nodal motion known
amongst such systems nowadays. This is the first analysis of an extragalactic
binary with nodal precession. This effect is probably caused by a distant third
body orbiting the pair, which could potentially be detected via spectroscopy.
Some preliminary estimates of this body are presented. However, even such a
result can tell us something about the multiplicity fraction in other galaxies.

solution of boundary value problems for parabolic equations. The problem
solution is derived using the fully implicit scheme, whereas a time step is
selected via explicit calculations. The selection strategy consists of the
following steps. First, using the explicit scheme, we calculate the solution at
a new time level. Next, we employ this solution in order to obtain the solution
at the previous time level (the implicit scheme, explicit calculations). This
solution should be close to the solution of our problem at this time level with
a prescribed accuracy. Such an algorithm leads to explicit formulas for the
calculation of the time step and takes into account both the dynamics of the
problem solution and changes in coefficients of the equation and in its
right-hand side. The same formulas for the evaluation of the time step we get
using a comparison of two approximate solutions, which are obtained using the
explicit scheme with the primary time step and the step that is reduced by

problem, which demonstrate the robustness of the developed algorithm for the

avoid large FCNC transitions and provide very interesting phenomena in some
low-energy processes. In this paper, we study their effects on exclusive
radiative B-meson decays due to the exchange of colourless or coloured charged
Higgs. It is found that, while constraints from the branching ratios are
slightly weaker than the ones from the inclusive $B\to X_{s} \gamma$ decay, the
isospin asymmetries in exclusive decays provide very complementary bounds on
the model parameters. As the two models predict similar corrections to the
dipole coefficient $C_7^{\rm eff}$ whereas similar magnitudes but with opposite
signs to $C_8^{\rm eff}$, the branching ratios cannot discriminate the two
models, and we have to resort to the direct CP and isospin asymmetries of $b\to
s$ processes, which are more sensitive to $C_8^{\rm eff}$. Due to the CKM
factors $|\lambda_u^{(d)}|\sim|\lambda_t^{(d)}|$, the terms proportional to
$\lambda_u^{(d)}$ make the observables of $b\to d$ processes exhibit a
different dependence on the possible new physics phase. In addition,
correlations between the various observables in the exclusive $B\to V\gamma$

decay (UNIV) of Poenaru et al., the Universal Decay Law (UDL) and the Scaling
Law of Horoi et al., has also been used for the evaluation of the decay half
lives. A comparison of our predicted half lives with the values evaluated using

be considered as a unified model for alpha and cluster decay studies. The
spontaneous fission half lives of the corresponding parents have also been
evaluated using the semi-empirical formula of Santhosh et al. Within our

clusters and the maximum cluster formation probability for the decay
accompanying $^{298}$114 reveals its doubly magic behavior. In the plots for
log_10(T_1/2) against the neutron number of the daughter in the corresponding

$^{298}$114 (Z = 114, N = 184) and this also indicate its doubly magic
behavior. Most of the predicted half lives are well within the present upper
limit for measurements and the computed alpha half lives for $^{290,292}$116
agrees well with the experimental data. We have thus confidently indicate
towards a new island for the cluster radioactivity around the superheavy

spatio-temporally chaotic systems. From a dynamical systems viewpoint, it is
desirable to obtain corresponding exact solutions, though their existence is
not guaranteed. A damping filter method is introduced to obtain variously
localized solutions, and adopted into two typical cases. This method introduces
a spatially selective damping effect to make a good guess at the exact
solution, and we can obtain an exact solution through a continuation with the
damping amplitude. First target is a steady solution to Swift-Hohenberg
equation, which is a representative of bi-stable systems in which localized
solutions coexist, and a model for span-wisely localized cases. Not only
solutions belonging to the well-known snaking branches but also those belonging
to an isolated branch known as ""isolas"" are found with a continuation paths
between them in phase space extended with the damping amplitude. This indicates
that this spatially selective excitation mechanism has an advantage in
searching spatially localized solutions. Second target is a spatially localized
traveling-wave solution to Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, which is a model for
stream-wisely localized cases. Since the spatially selective damping effect
breaks Galilean and translational invariances, the propagation velocity cannot
be determined uniquely while the damping is active, and a singularity arises
when these invariances are recovered. We demonstrate that this singularity can
be avoided by imposing a simple condition, and a localized traveling-wave
solution is obtained with a specific propagation speed.

not satisfy sharp oracle inequalities with high probability, we prove that a
weaker notion of oracle inequality for EW that holds with high probability.
Moreover, using a generalization of the newly introduced $Q$-aggregation scheme
we also prove sharp oracle inequalities that hold with high probability.
Finally, we apply our results to universal aggregation and show that our

aggregates is studied in the continuum mass and momentum-transfer regimes. The
synthetic aggregates were generated by a cluster-cluster aggregation algorithm.
The analysis of their morphological features suggests that the fractal
dimension is a descriptor of a cluster's large-scale structure, whereas the
fractal prefactor is a local-structure indicator. For a constant fractal
dimension, the prefactor becomes also an indicator of a cluster's shape
anisotropy. The hydrodynamic radius of orientationally averaged aggregates was
calculated via molecule-aggregate collision rates determined from the solution
of a Laplace equation. An empirical expression that relates the aggregate
hydrodynamic radius to its radius of gyration and the number of primary
particles is proposed. The suggested expression depends only on geometrical
quantities, being independent of statistical (ensemble-averaged) properties
like the fractal dimension and prefactor. Hydrodynamic radius predictions for a
variety of fractal-like aggregates are in very good agreement with predictions
of other methods and literature values. Aggregate dynamic shape factors and

From extensive computer simulations of the 2D stochastic Langevin equation we
present an in-depth study of this HDP. In particular, we find that the MSDs
along the radial and azimuthal directions in a circular domain obey anomalous
and Brownian scaling, respectively. We demonstrate that the time averaged MSD
stays linear as a function of the lag time and the system thus reveals a weak
ergodicity breaking. Our results will enable one to rationalise the diffusive
motion of larger tracer particles such as viruses or submicron beads in

star onto a white dwarf via Roche lobe overflow. This material forms an
accretion disk around the white dwarf. Ultimately, a fraction of this material
spirals in and piles up on the white dwarf surface under electron-degenerate
conditions. The subsequently occurring thermonuclear runaway reaches hundreds
of megakelvin and explosively ejects matter into the interstellar medium. The
exact peak temperature strongly depends on the underlying white dwarf mass, the
accreted mass and metallicity, and the initial white dwarf luminosity.
Observations of elemental abundance enrichments in these classical nova events
imply that the ejected matter consists not only of processed solar material
from the main sequence partner but also of material from the outer layers of
the underlying white dwarf. This indicates that white dwarf and accreted matter
mix prior to the thermonuclear runaway. The processes by which this mixing
occurs require further investigation to be understood. In this work, we analyze
elemental abundances ejected from hydrodynamic nova models in search of
elemental abundance ratios that are useful indicators of the total amount of
mixing. We identify the abundance ratios $\Sigma$CNO/H, Ne/H, Mg/H, Al/H, and
Si/H as useful mixing meters in ONe novae. The impact of thermonuclear reaction
rate uncertainties on the mixing meters is investigated using Monte Carlo
post-processing network calculations with temperature-density evolutions of all
mass zones computed by the hydrodynamic models. We find that the current
uncertainties in the $^{30}$P($p$,$\gamma$)$^{31}$S rate influence the Si/H
abundance ratio, but overall the mixing meters found here are robust against
nuclear physics uncertainties. A comparison of our results with observations of
ONe novae provides strong constraints for classical nova models.

distance is a measure of absolute difference between a pair of dependent

distance between the dependent iterations, lead to easy partitioning of the
iteration space and hence they have been successfully dealt with.
  Parallelization of loops with variable distance data dependences is a
considerably difficult problem. It is our belief that partitioning the
iteration space in such loops cannot be done without examining solutions of the
corresponding Linear Diophantine Equations. Focus of this work is to study
variable distance data dependences and examine the relation between dependent
iterations. Our analysis based on parametric solution leads to a mathematical
formulation capturing dependence between iterations. Our approach shows the
existence of reasonable exploitable parallelism in variable distance data

deconfining-preconfining phase transition of an SU(2) Yang-Mills theory
postulated to describe photon propagation, and we describe how, starting at a

depressions into the CMB. Upon projection along a line of sight, a given
depression influences the present CMB sky in a cosmologically local way,
possibly explaining the large-angle anomalies confirmed recently by the Planck

vector modes roughly match the number of degrees of freedom in cosmic neutrinos

as single center-vortex loops in confining phases of SU(2) Yang-Mills theories
neutrino mass $m_\nu$ solely arises by interactions with an environment.
Cosmologically, the CMB represents this environment, and thus one would expect
that $m_\nu=\xi T$ where $\xi=O(1)$. In this model cosmic neutrinos are a small
dark-matter contribution, conserved only together with the CMB fluid,
influencing Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations during CMB decoupling.

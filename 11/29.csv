to conclude that the penetrating radiation responsible for the discharge of
electroscopes was of extraterrestrial origin. One century from the discovery of
this phenomenon seems to be a good time to stop and think about what we have
understood about Cosmic Rays. The aim of this review is to illustrate the ideas
that have been and are being explored in order to account for the observable
quantities related to cosmic rays and to summarize the numerous new pieces of
observation that are becoming available. In fact, despite the possible
impression that development in this field is somewhat slow, the rate of new
discoveries in the last decade or so has been impressive, and mainly driven by
beautiful pieces of observation. At the same time scientists in this field have
been able to propose new, fascinating ways to investigate particle acceleration
inside the sources, making use of multifrequency observations that range from
the radio, to the optical, to X-rays and gamma rays. These ideas can now be
confronted with data. I will mostly focus on supernova remnants as the most
plausible sources of Galactic cosmic rays, and I will review the main aspects
of the modern theory of diffusive particle acceleration at supernova remnant
shocks, with special attention for the dynamical reaction of accelerated
particles on the shock and the phenomenon of magnetic field amplification at
the shock. Cosmic ray escape from the sources is discussed as a necessary step
to determine the spectrum of cosmic rays at the Earth. In the end of this
review I will also discuss the phenomenon of cosmic ray acceleration at shocks
propagating in partially ionized media and the implications of this phenomenon
in terms of width of the Balmer line emission.

Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) and FARGO simulations of self-gravitating accretion
discs with beta-cooling do not converge as resolution is increased.
Furthermore, this recent work suggests that by carefully optimising the
artificial viscosity parameters in these codes it can be shown that
fragmentation may occur for much longer cooling times than earlier work
suggests. If correct, this result is intriguing as it suggests that gas giant
planets could form, via direct gravitational collapse, reasonably close to
their parent stars. This result is, however, slightly surprising and there have
been a number of recent studies suggesting that the result is likely an
indication of a numerical problem with the simulations. One suggestion, in
particular, is that the SPH results are influenced by the manner in which the
cooling is implemented. We extend this work here and show that if the cooling
is implemented in a manner that removes a known numerical artefact in the shock
regions, the fragmentation boundary converges to a value consistent with
earlier work and that fragmentation is unlikely for the long cooling times
suggested by this recent work. We also investigate the optimisation of the
artificial viscosity parameters and show that the values that appear optimal
are likely introducing numerical problems in both the SPH and FARGO
simulations. We therefore conclude that earlier predictions for the cooling
times required for fragmentation are likely correct and that, as suggested by
this earlier work, fragmentation cannot occur in the inner parts (r < 50 au) of
typical protostellar discs.

estimation of stellar masses and radii have still not been investigated well.
We study the impact on mass and radius determination of the uncertainty in the
input physics, in the mixing-length value, in the initial helium abundance, and
in the microscopic diffusion efficiency adopted in stellar model computations.
We consider stars with mass in the range [0.8 - 1.1] Msun and evolutionary
stages from the zero-age main sequence to the central hydrogen exhaustion.
Stellar parameters were recovered by a maximum-likelihood technique, comparing
the observations constraints to a grid of stellar models. Synthetic grids with
perturbed input were adopted to estimate the systematic errors arising from the
current uncertainty in model computations. We found that the statistical error
components, owing to the current typical uncertainty in the observations, are
nearly constant in all cases at about 4.5% and 2.2% on mass and radius
determination, respectively. The systematic bias on mass and radius
determination due to a variation of $\pm$ 1 in Delta Y/Delta Z is $\pm$ 2.3%
and $\pm$ 1.1%; the one due to a change of $\pm$ 0.24 in the value of the
mixing-length is $\pm$ 2.1% and $\pm$ 1.0%; the one due to a variation of $\pm$
5% in the radiative opacity is $\mp$ 1.0% and $\mp$ 0.45%. An important bias
source is to neglect microscopic diffusion, which accounts for errors of about
3.7% and 1.5% on mass and radius. The cumulative effects of the considered
uncertainty sources can produce biased estimates of stellar characteristics.
Comparison of the results of our technique with other grid techniques shows
that the systematic biases induced by the differences in the estimation grids
are generally greater than the statistical errors involved.

microstructure. A bilinear, time-independent cohesive zone law is implemented
for describing fracture behaviour of grain boundaries. Simulation conditions
are similar to those found at contact between a head and a cup of hip
prosthesis. Residual stresses arisen from the mismatch of thermal coefficient
between grains are determined. Then, effects of a micro-void and contact stress
magnitude are investigated with models containing residual stresses. For the
purpose of simulating fatigue behaviour, cyclic loadings are applied to the
models. Findings - Results show that crack density is gradually increased with
increasing magnitude of contact stress or number of fatigue cycles. It is also
identified that a micro-void brings about the increase of crack density rate.
Social implications - This paper is the first step for predicting the lifetime
of ceramic implants. The social implications would appear in the next few years
about health issues. Originality/value - This proposed finite element method
allows describing fracture and fatigue behaviours of alumina-zirconia

applications to clinical trials introduced in Bai, HU (1999,2005) and Bai, Hu,
Shen (2002). We no longer assume that the drawing rule is uniform among the
balls of the urn (which contains d colors), but can be reinforced by a function
f. This is a way to model risk aversion. Firstly, by considering that f is
concave or convex and by reformulating the dynamics of the urn composition as
an SA algorithm with remainder, we derive the a.s. convergence and the
asymptotic normality (Central Limit Theorem, CLT) of the normalized procedure
by calling upon the so-called ODE and SDE methods. An in-depth analysis of the
case d=2 exhibits two different behaviors: A single equilibrium point when f is
concave, and when f is convex, a transition phase from a single attracting
equilibrium to a system with two attracting and one repulsive equilibrium
points. The last setting is solved using results on non-convergence toward
noisy and noiseless ""traps"" in order to deduce the a.s. convergence toward one
of the attracting points. Secondly, the special case of a Polya urn (when the
addition rule is the identity matrix) is analyzed, still using result from SA
theory about ""traps"". Finally, these results are applied to a function with
regular variation and to an optimal asset allocation in Finance.

studied. In order to find the BLUE estimator of the unknown parameter, the FC
combines spatially distributed, linearly processed, noisy observations of local
sensors received through orthogonal channels corrupted by fading and additive
Gaussian noise. Most optimal power-allocation schemes proposed in the
literature require the feedback of the exact instantaneous channel state
information from the FC to local sensors. This paper proposes a
limited-feedback strategy in which the FC designs an optimal codebook
containing the optimal power-allocation vectors, in an iterative offline
process, based on the generalized Lloyd algorithm with modified distortion
functions. Upon observing a realization of the channel vector, the FC finds the
closest codeword to its corresponding optimal power-allocation vector and
broadcasts the index of the codeword. Each sensor will then transmit its analog
observations using its optimal quantized amplification gain. This approach
eliminates the requirement for infinite-rate digital feedback links and is
scalable, especially in large WSNs.

approximation (LPA). The principle of minimal sensitivity (PMS) is used for the
optimization of the CSS regulator, recovering all the major types of regulators
in appropriate limits. Within the investigated class of functional forms, a
thorough investigation of the CSS regulator, optimized with two different
normalizations within the PMS method, confirms that the functional form of a
regulator first proposed by Litim is optimal within the LPA. However, Litim's
exact form leads to a kink in the regulator function. A form of the CSS
regulator, numerically close to Litim's limit while maintaining infinite
differentiability, remains compatible with the gradient expansion to all
orders. A smooth analytic behaviour of the regulator is ensured by a small, but
finite value of the exponential fall-off parameter in the CSS regulator.
Consequently, a compactly supported regulator, in a parameter regime close to
Litim's optimized form, but regularized with an exponential factor, appears to
have favorable properties and could be used to address the scheme dependence of
the functional renormalization group, at least within the the approximations
employed in the studies reported here.

quantum analogue of NP. The complexity of its semi-classical version, in which
the terms of the Hamiltonian are required to commute (the CLH problem), has
attracted considerable attention recently due to its intriguing nature, as well
as in relation to growing interest in the qPCP conjecture. We show here that if
the underlying bipartite interaction graph of the CLH instance is a good
locally-expanding graph, namely, the expansion of any constant-size set is
e-close to optimal, then approximating its ground energy to within additive
factor O(e) lies in NP. The proof holds for k- local Hamiltonians for any
constant k and any constant dimensionality of particles d. We also show that
the approximation problem of CLH on such good local expanders is NP-hard. This
implies that too good local expansion of the interaction graph constitutes an
obstacle against quantum hardness of the approximation problem, though it
retains its classical hardness. The result highlights new difficulties in
trying to mimic classical proofs (in particular Dinur's PCP proof) in an
attempt to prove the quantum PCP conjecture. A related result was discovered
recently independently by Brandao and Harrow, for 2-local general Hamiltonians,
bounding the quantum hardness of the approximation problem on good expanders,
though no NP-hardness is known in that case.

been established \cite{LO, DL}. For one-dimensional systems, we investigate
$\kappa_2 (\xi)$ as $\xi\to 0$ in three cases: the disordered harmonic chain,
the rotor chain and a chain of strongly anharmonic oscillators. Moreover, we

field from the north polar region of the Sun. In addition to cosmic ray data,
we utilize simultaneous solar and interplanetary plasma/field data including
the tilt angle of the heliospheric current sheet. We study the relation between
simultaneous variations in cosmic ray intensity and solar/interplanetary
parameters during the declining and the minimum phases of cycle 23. We compare
these relations with those obtained for the same phases in the three previous
solar cycles. We observe certain peculiar features in cosmic ray modulation
during the minimum of solar cycle 23 including the record high GCR intensity.
We find, during this unusual minimum, that the correlation of GCR intensity is
poor with sunspot number (R = -0.41), better with interplanetary magnetic field
(R = -0.66), still better with solar wind velocity (R = -0.80) and much better
with the tilt angle of the heliospheric current sheet (R = -0.92). In our view,
it is not the diffusion or the drift alone, but the solar wind convection is
the most likely additional effect responsible for the record high GCR intensity
observed during the deep minimum of solar cycle 23.

vital organizing role of the Maxwell 'energy criterion' load in the advanced
post-buckling of long-thin structures which exhibit severe shell-like
imperfection sensitivity. It has become clear that above the Maxwell load,
$P_M$, there are localized solutions offering an order-of-magnitude increase in
sensitivity to lateral side-loads, whether static or dynamic. We propose to
call this 'shock-sensitivity', and notice that so far only the seminal paper by
Horak, Lord and Peletier in 2006 has quantified this in terms of an $E(P)$
energy-barrier versus load graph. In this paper we present three graphs of this
nature for archetypal problems: the free twisted rod, the cylindrically
constrained rod, and the strut on a softening elastic foundation. We find in
all cases that the energy barrier of the localizing solution above $P_M$ is
quite close to the energy of a single periodic wave. Now a single such wave is
not kinematically admissible, and the corresponding periodic barrier must be
for all the waves in the long structure, $N$, say. So in practice $N$ will be
large, and does indeed tend to infinity with the length of the structure. Thus
the sensitivity increases by a factor of a large $N$ as the Maxwell load is
exceeded. This is important in its own right, and we do not seek to explain or
fit curves to the scattered experimental buckling loads of shell structures.

  (...)
  We show that previous empirical scaling laws for the magnetic field strength
essentially reflect the statistical balance between energy production and

necessarily valid for any dynamo in statistical equilibrium and applicable to
any numerical model, irrespectively of the dynamo mechanism.

biases in the parameters space covered in the numerics and to the role of a

considerations. We show that our predictive scaling laws can properly describe
the numerical database and reflect the dominant forces balance at work in these

and the techniques proposed by Dinur and Guruswami [FOCS 2013] to incorporate
this code for inapproximability results. In particular, we prove
quasi-NP-hardness of the following problems on $n$-vertex hyper-graphs:
  * Coloring a 2-colorable 8-uniform hypergraph with
$2^{2^{\Omega(\sqrt{\log\log n})}}$ colors.
  * Coloring a 4-colorable 4-uniform hypergraph with
$2^{2^{\Omega(\sqrt{\log\log n})}}$ colors.
  * Coloring a 3-colorable 3-uniform hypergraph with $(\log
n)^{\Omega(1/\log\log\log n)}$ colors.
  In each of these cases, the hardness results obtained are (at least)
exponentially stronger than what was previously known for the respective cases.
In fact, prior to this result, polylog n colors was the strongest quantitative
bound on the number of colors ruled out by inapproximability results for
O(1)-colorable hypergraphs.
  The fundamental bottleneck in obtaining coloring inapproximability results
using the low- degree long code was a multipartite structural restriction in
the PCP construction of Dinur-Guruswami. We are able to get around this
restriction by simulating the multipartite structure implicitly by querying
just one partition (albeit requiring 8 queries), which yields our result for
2-colorable 8-uniform hypergraphs. The result for 4-colorable 4-uniform
hypergraphs is obtained via a 'query doubling' method. For 3-colorable
3-uniform hypergraphs, we exploit the ternary domain to design a test with an
additive (as opposed to multiplicative) noise function, and analyze its
efficacy in killing high weight Fourier coefficients via the pseudorandom
properties of an associated quadratic form.

such dephasing mechanisms - especially in the low-frequency regime - by
analyzing temporal and spatial particle correlations available in modern
detectors. Such correlations can reveal interference properties that would
otherwise be washed out due to dephasing by external oscillating signals. The
method is shown experimentally in a biprism electron interferometer where a
perturbing oscillation is artificially introduced by a periodically varying
magnetic field. We provide a full theoretical description of the particle
correlations where the perturbing frequency and amplitude can be revealed from
the disturbed interferogram. The original spatial fringe pattern without the
perturbation can thereby be restored. The technique can be applied to lower the
general noise requirements in matter-wave interferometers. It allows for the
optimization of electromagnetic shielding and decreases the efforts for
vibrational or temperature stabilization.

kinds of sources appeared (chromospheric and coronal), in the early and later

commonly observed in the lower atmosphere. The gradual emissions have a clear
identification with the classical loop-prominence system, but are brighter than

find the HMI flux exceeds the radio/X-ray interpolation of the bremsstrahlung
produced in the flare soft X-ray sources by at least one order of magnitude.
This implies the participation of cooler sources that can produce free-bound
continua and possibly line emission detectable by HMI. One of the early sources
dynamically resembles ""coronal rain"", appearing at a maximum apparent height

134 $\pm$ 8 $\mathrm{km s^{-1}}$. Not much literature exists on the detection

varying thermal emission and a total energy of E_{iso,1st} = 2.60 x 10^{53}

sensor biases, the problem is usually cast as a mixed identification/filtering,
and the resulting observability analysis provides a necessary condition for any
algorithm to converge to a unique point estimate. Unfortunately, most models
treat sensor bias rates as noise, independent of other states including biases
themselves, an assumption that is patently violated in practice. When this
assumption is lifted, the resulting model is not observable, and therefore past
analyses cannot be used to conclude that the set of states that are
indistinguishable from the measurements is a singleton. In other words, the
resulting model is not observable. We therefore re-cast the analysis as one of
sensitivity: Rather than attempting to prove that the indistinguishable set is
a singleton, which is not the case, we derive bounds on its volume, as a
function of characteristics of the input and its sufficient excitation. This
provides an explicit characterization of the indistinguishable set that can be
used for analysis and validation purposes.

one of three ways: simulations, real deployment on Internet, or on an emulated
network testbed such as a cluster. Simulations can study very large systems but
often abstract out many practical details, whereas real world tests are often
quite small, on the order of a few hundred nodes at most, but have very
realistic conditions. Clusters and other dedicated testbeds offer a middle
ground between the two: large systems with real application code. They also
typically allow configuring the testbed to enable repeatable experiments. In
this paper we explore how to run large BitTorrent experiments in a cluster
setup. We have chosen BitTorrent because the source code is available and it
has been a popular target for research. Our contribution is twofold. First, we
show how to tweak and configure the BitTorrent client to allow for a maximum
number of clients to be run on a single machine, without running into any
physical limits of the machine. Second, our results show that the behavior of
BitTorrent can be very sensitive to the configuration and we revisit some
existing BitTorrent research and consider the implications of our findings on
previously published results. As we show in this paper, BitTorrent can change
its behavior in subtle ways which are sometimes ignored in published works.

on olfactory signals and (iii) infer the wiring of the neural circuit, the

Increasing the mixing-length parameter $\alpha$ leads to more turbulent dynamic

problem where a robust loss function is used to measure the reconstruction
error of a low-rank matrix approximation of the data, and an appropriately
defined two-way roughness penalty function is used to ensure smoothness along
each of the two functional domains. By viewing the minimization problem as two

naturally incorporates missing values. Furthermore, our formulation allows
rigorous derivation of leave-one-row/column-out cross-validation and

reactions between some proteins and DNA. Such DNA-binding proteins have to find
specific sequences on very long DNA molecules and they mostly do so in absence
of any active process. It has been rapidly recognized that to achieve this task
these proteins should be efficient at both searching (i.e. sampling fast
relevant parts of DNA) and finding (i.e. recognizing the specific site). A
two-mode search and variants of it have been suggested since the 70s to explain
either a fast search or an efficient recognition. Combining these two
properties at a phenomenological level is however more difficult as they appear
to have antagonist roles. To overcome this difficulty, one may simply need to
drop the dihcotomic view inherent to the two-mode search and look more
thoroughly at the set of interactions between DNA-binding proteins and a given
DNA segment either specific or non-specific. This chapter demonstrates that, in
doing so in a very generic way, one may indeed find a potential reconciliation
between a fast search and an efficient recognition. Although a lot remains to
be done, this could be the time for a change of paradigm

only laboratories where the physics in ultra-strong magnetic fields can be
directly tested. Until now, spectroscopic and timing measurements at X-ray
energies in soft gamma-repeaters (SGRs) and anomalous X-ray pulsar (AXPs) have
been the main source of information about the physical properties of a magnetar
and of its magnetosphere. Spectral fitting in the ~ 0.5-10 keV range allowed to
validate the ""twisted magnetosphere"" model, probing the structure of the
external field and estimating the density and velocity of the magnetospheric
currents. Spectroscopy alone, however, may fail in disambiguating the two key
parameters governing magnetospheric scattering (the charge velocity and the
twist angle) and is quite insensitive to the source geometry. X-ray
polarimetry, on the other hand, can provide a quantum leap in the field by
adding two extra observables, the linear polarization degree and the
polarization angle. Using the bright AXP 1RXS J170849.0-400910 as a template,
we show that phase-resolved polarimetric measurements can unambiguously
determine the model parameters, even with a small X-ray polarimetry mission
carrying modern photoelectric detectors and existing X-ray optics. We also show
that polarimetric measurements can pinpoint vacuum polarization effects and
thus provide an indirect evidence for ultra-strong magnetic fields.

The $UBVRI$ observations were made through the 2m HCT (Himalayan Chandra

the Hanle Faint Object Spectrograph Camera (HFOSC) mounted on the 2m HCT. The
observed galaxies are NGC 1140, IRAS 07164+5301, NGC 3738, UM 311, NGC 6764,
NGC 4861 and NGC 3003. The optical spectra have been used to search for the
faint WR features, to confirm that the ionization of the gas is consequence of
the massive stars, and to quantify the oxygen abundance of each galaxy using
several and independent empirical calibrations. We detected the broad features
originated by WR stars in NGC 1140 and NGC 4861 and used them to derive their
population of massive stars. Using our H$\alpha$ images we have identified tens
of regions within these galaxies, for which we derived the SFR. For all regions
we found that the most recent star-formation event is 3 - 6 Myr old. We used
the optical broad-band colours in combination with Starburst99 models to
estimate the internal reddening and the age of the dominant underlying stellar
population within all these regions. Knots in NGC 3738, NGC 6764 and NGC 3003
generally show the presence of an important old (400 - 1000 Myr) stellar
population. However, the optical colours are not able to detect stars older
than 20 - 50 Myr in the knots of the other four galaxies. This fact suggests
both the intensity of the starbursts and that the star-formation activity has
been ongoing for at least some few tens of million years in these objects.

binary systems. In several such binary systems the masses of the companion
stars have been derived allowing to distinguish two classes of objects, called
the Black Widow and the Redback binaries. Pulsars in these binary systems are
expected to produce winds which, colliding with stellar winds, create
conditions for acceleration of electrons. These electrons should interact with
the anisotropic radiation from the companion stars producing gamma-ray emission
modulated with the orbital period of the binary system. We consider the
interaction of a millisecond pulsar (MSP) wind with a very inhomogeneous
stellar wind from the companion star within binary systems of the Black Widow
and Redback types. It is expected that the pulsar wind should mix efficiently
with the inhomogeneous stellar wind. Electrons accelerated in such mixed,
turbulent winds can interact with the magnetic field and also strong radiation
from the companion star producing not only synchrotron radiation but also
gamma-rays in the the Inverse Compton process. Applying numerical methods, we
calculated the GeV-TeV gamma-ray spectra and the light curves expected from
some millisecond pulsar binary systems. It is concluded that energetic
millisecond pulsar binary systems create a new class of TeV gamma-ray sources
which could be detectable by the future Cherenkov arrays (e.g. CTA) and
possibly also by the extensive campaigns with the present arrays (HESS, MAGIC,
VERITAS). However, gamma-ray emission from the millisecond pulsar binary
systems is predicted to have different features than those observed in the case
of massive TeV gamma-ray binaries such as LS I 303 61 or LS 5039. The maximum
in the TeV gamma-ray orbital light curve should appear when the MSP is behind
the companion star.

We conclude that, though the radio pulsar is currently not detectable, the
pulsar mechanism is still active and the pulsar wind, as well as a newly formed
accretion disk, are together providing the necessary conditions to create the
gamma-ray increase. The system is the first example of a transient, compact,
low-mass gamma-ray binary and will continue to provide an exceptional test bed
for better understanding the formation of millisecond pulsars as well as

  Transmission System","10 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  Polarization mode dispersion (PMD) is a challenge for high-data-rate
optical-communication systems. More researches are desirable for impairments
that is induced by PMD in high-speed optical orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) transmission system. In this paper, an approximately
analytical method for evaluating the power penalty due to first-order PMD in
optical OFDM with quadrature amplitude modulation (OFDM/QAM) and filter bank
based multi-carrier with offset quadrature amplitude modulation (FBMC/OQAM)
transmission system is presented. The simulation results show that, compared
with the single carrier with quadrature phase shift keying(SC-QPSK), both the
OFDM/QAM and the FBMC/OQAM can decrease the power penalty caused by PMD by
half. Furthermore, the FBMC/OQAM shows better power penalty immunity than the
OFDM/QAM under the influence of first order PMD.

pairing force coupling constant G where the HB solution shifts from a zero to a

masses near N = Z for A = 24-100, where N and Z are the numbers of neutrons and
protons, and A = N + Z. The dimension of the valence space is 2A in these

exceptional power density and cyclability. Their energy density can be
increased using ionic liquids and electrodes with sub-nanometer pores, but this
tends to reduce their power density and compromise the key advantage of
supercapacitors. To help address this issue through material optimization, here
we unravel the mechanisms of charging sub-nanometer pores with ionic liquids
using molecular simulations, navigated by a phenomenological model. We show
that charging of ionophilic pores is a diffusive process, often accompanied by
overfilling followed by de-filling. In sharp contrast to conventional
expectations, charging is fast because ion diffusion during charging can be an
order of magnitude faster than in bulk, and charging itself is accelerated by
the onset of collective modes. Further acceleration can be achieved using
ionophobic pores by eliminating overfilling/de-filling and thus leading to
charging behavior qualitatively different from that in conventional, ionophilic
pores.

belonging to the Seyfert 1 class (S1), on the basis of the match of the
intensities of their Broad Balmer Lines (BBL) with the Boltzmann Plots (BP).
These two types of S1 galaxies, that we call BP-S1 and NoBP-S1, are
characterized, in first approximation, by Broad Line Regions (BLR) with
different structural and physical properties. In this communication, we show
that these features can be well pointed out by a multi-wavelength analysis of
the continuum and of the broad recombination Hydrogen lines, that we carry out
on a sample of objects detected at optical and X-ray frequencies. The
investigation is addressed to verify whether BP-S1 are the ideal candidates for
the study of the kinematical and structural properties of the BLR, in order to
derive reliable estimates of the mass of their central engine and to constrain
the properties of their nuclear continuum spectrum.

are investigated. The main features of the scheme are the preservation of the
nonnegativity and the entropy-dissipation structure of the diffusive equations.
The key ideas are to combine Dahlquist's G-stability theory with
entropy-dissipation methods and to introduce a nonlinear transformation of
variables which provides a quadratic structure in the equations. It is shown
that G-stability of the one-leg scheme is sufficient to derive discrete entropy
dissipation estimates. The general result is applied to a cross-diffusion
system from population dynamics and a nonlinear fourth-order quantum diffusion
model, for which the existence of semi-discrete weak solutions is proved. Under
some assumptions on the operator of the evolution equation, the second-order
convergence of solutions is shown. Moreover, some numerical experiments for the
population model are presented, which underline the theoretical results.

difference to conventional direct current magnetron sputtering. The origin of
these ions is still an open issue, which is unraveled by using two fast
diagnostics: time resolved mass spectrometry with a temporal resolution of 2
$\mu$s and phase resolved optical emission spectroscopy with a temporal
resolution of 1 $\mu$s. A power scan from dcMS-like to HiPIMS plasmas was
performed, with a 2-inch magnetron and a titanium target as sputter source and
argon as working gas. Clear differences in the transport as well in the
energetic properties of Ar$^{+}$, Ar$^{2+}$, Ti$^+$ and Ti$^{2+}$ were
observed. For discharges with highest peak power densities a high energetic
group of Ti$^+$ and Ti$^{2+}$ could be identified. A cold group of ions is
always present. It is found that hot ions are observed only, when the plasma
enters the spokes regime, which can be monitored by oscillations in the
IV-characteristics in the MHz range that are picked up by the used VI-probes.
These oscillations are correlated with the spokes phenomenon and are explained
as an amplification of the Hall current inside the spokes as hot ionization
zones. To explain the presence of energetic ions, we propose a double layer
(DL) confining the hot plasma inside a spoke: if an atom becomes ionized inside
the spokes region it is accelerated because of the DL to higher energies
whereas its energy remains unchanged if it is ionized outside. In applying this
DL model to our measurements the observed phenomena as well as several
measurements from other groups can be explained. Only if spokes and a double
layer are present the confined particles can gain enough energy to leave the
magnetic trap. We conclude from our findings that the spoke phenomenon
represents the essence of HiPIMS plasmas, explaining their good performance for
material synthesis applications.

self-affine surface roughness seems to necessitate knowledge of a large number
of parameters. However, few parameters suffice to determine many important
interfacial properties as we show by combining dimensional analysis with
numerical simulations. This insight is used to deduce the pressure dependence
of the relative contact area and the mean interfacial separation $\Delta
\bar{u}$ and to present the results in a compact form. Given a proper unit
choice for pressure $p$, i.e., effective modulus $E^*$ times the
root-mean-square gradient $\bar{g}$, the relative contact area mainly depends
on $p$ but barely on the Hurst exponent $H$ even at large $p$. When using the
root-mean-square height $\bar{h}$ as unit of length, $\Delta \bar{u}$
additionally depends on the ratio of the height spectrum cutoffs at short and
long wavelengths. In the fractal limit, where that ratio is zero, solely the
roughness at short wavelengths is relevant for $\Delta \bar{u}$. This limit,
however, should not be relevant for practical applications. Our work contains a
brief summary of the employed numerical method Green's function molecular
dynamics including an illustration of how to systematically overcome numerical
shortcomings through appropriate finite-size, fractal, and discretization
corrections. Additionally, we outline the derivation of Persson theory in
dimensionless units. Persson theory compares well to the numerical reference

tangencies between both vectors can in principle occur. Here we find that the

inhibited at low accretion rates. Several sources, however, are known to
pulsate in quiescence at luminosities below the theoretical limit predicted for
the onset of the centrifugal barrier. The source 1A 0535+262 is one of them.
Here we present the results of an analysis of a ~50 ks long XMM-Newton
observation of 1A 0535+262 in quiescence. At the time of the observation, the
neutron star was close to apastron, and the source had remained quiet for two
orbital cycles. In spite of this, we detected a pulsed X-ray flux of ~3e-11
erg/cm2/s . Several observed properties, including the power spectrum, remained
similar to those observed in the outbursts. Particularly, we have found that
the frequency of the break detected in the quiescent noise power spectrum
follows the same correlation with flux observed when the source is in outburst.
This correlation has been associated with the truncation of the accretion disk
at the magnetosphere boundary. We argue that our result, along with other
arguments previously reported in the literature, suggests that the accretion in
quiescence also proceeds from an accretion disk around the neutron star. The
proposed scenario consistently explains the energy of the cyclotron line
observed in 1A 0535+262, and the timing properties of the source including the
spin frequency evolution within and between the outbursts, and the frequency of

and construction of invariant differential operators for non-compact semisimple
Lie groups. Our starting points is the class of algebras, which we called
earlier 'conformal Lie algebras' (CLA), which have very similar properties to
the conformal algebras of Minkowski space-time, though our aim is to go beyond
this class in a natural way. For this we introduced recently the new notion of
{\it parabolic relation} between two non-compact semisimple Lie algebras $\cal
G$ and $\cal G'$ that have the same complexification and possess maximal
parabolic subalgebras with the same complexification. Thus, we consider the
exceptional algebra $E_{7(7)}$ which is parabolically related to the CLA
$E_{7(-25)}$. Other interesting examples are the orthogonal algebras $so(p,q)$
all of which are parabolically related to the conformal algebra $so(n,2)$ with
$p+q=n+2$, the parabolic subalgebras including the Lorentz subalgebra
$so(n-1,1)$ and its analogs $so(p-1,q-1)$. Further we consider the algebras
$sl(2n,R)$ and for $n=2k$ the algebras $su^*(4k)$ which are parabolically
related to the CLA $su(n,n)$. Further we consider the algebras $sp(r,r)$ which
are parabolically related to the CLA $sp(2r,R)$. We consider also $E_{6(6)}$
and $E_{6(2)}$ which are parabolically related to the hermitian symmetric case
$E_{6(-14)}$.

coupled-cavity QED system for selective transfer of a qubit constructed from
superposition of standard coherent states. The cavities arranged in such way
that the intermediate or channel cavity is connected uniformly to the sender
and N receiver cavities. We consider N different ternary sets of identical QDs
whose QDs have been distributed in the sender, channel and one of the receiver
cavities respectively. We demonstrate a situation in which the dynamics of the
system is confined selectively in a sub sector belongs to one of the ternary
set of QDs. This selective dynamics is able to transfer the coherent
state-constructed qubit (CSCQ) from the sender party to the desired receiver
one reliably. Also, we illustrate that the scheme is optimally robust due to
dissipations arises from photon losses in the cavities.

dynamical systems under time-varying disturbances, using dynamic diffusive
couplings. Necessary conditions are derived for general networks of nonlinear
systems, and these conditions are explicitly interpreted as conditions relating
the node dynamics and the network topology. For the class of incrementally
passive systems, necessary and sufficient conditions for output agreement are
derived. The approach proposed in the paper lends itself to solve flow control
problems in distribution networks. As a first case study, the internal model
approach is used for designing a controller that achieves an optimal routing
and inventory balancing in a dynamic transportation network with storage and
time-varying supply and demand. It is in particular shown that the time-varying
optimal routing problem can be solved by applying an internal model controller
to the dual variables of a certain convex network optimization problem. As a
second case study, we show that droop-controllers in microgrids have also an
interpretation as internal model controllers.

Weinberg-Salam model starting with a most general ansatz for static
axially-symmetric electroweak magnetic fields. The ansatz includes an explicit
construction of field configurations with various topologies described by the
monopole and Hopf charges. We introduce a unique SU(2) gauge invariant
definition for the electromagnetic field. It has been proved that the magnetic
charge of any finite energy monopole solution must be screened at far distance.
This implies non-existence of finite energy monopole solutions with a non-zero
total magnetic charge. In a case of a special axially-symmetric
Dashen-Hasslacher-Neveu ansatz we revise the structure of the sphaleron
solution and show that sphaleron represents a non-trivial system of monopole
and antimonopole with their centers located in one point. This is different
from the known interpretation of the sphaleron as a monopole-antimonopole pair
like Nambu's ""dumb-bell"". In general, the axially-symmetric magnetic field may
admit a helical structure. We conjecture that such a solution exists and
estimate an upper bound for its energy, E_{bound}=4.65 TeV.

with a steep velocity gradient is detected in ammonia, with a fractional
ammonia abundance compatible with determinations towards other dense cores. The
direction of the velocity gradient agrees with previous single-dish
observations, and the overall velocity distribution can be interpreted as
rotation. The rotation axis goes through the position of a compact far-infrared
source detected by Spitzer and Herschel. The specific angular momentum of the
core is typical for protostellar envelopes. A string of 1.2 cm continuum
sources is tentatively detected near the rotation axis. The ammonia spectra
suggest the presence of warm embedded gas in its vicinity. An hourglass-shaped
structure is seen in ammonia at the cloud's average LSR velocity, also aligned
with the rotation axis. Although this structure resembles a pair of outflow
lobes the ammonia spectra show no indications of shocked gas. The observed
ammonia structure mainly delineates the inner envelope around the central
source. The velocity gradient is likely to originate in the angular momentum of
the contracting core, although influence of the outflow from the neighbouring
young star IRS4 is possibly visible on one side of the core. The tentative
continuum detection and the indications of a warm background component near the
rotation axis suggest that the core contains a deeply embedded outflow which
may have been missed in previous single-dish CO surveys owing to beam dilution.

primitive of modern cryptography. However, relatively little is known about the
communication complexity of this primitive.
  In this work, we develop powerful information theoretic tools to prove lower
bounds on the communication complexity of MPC. We restrict ourselves to a
3-party setting in order to bring out the power of these tools without
introducing too many complications. Our techniques include the use of a data
processing inequality for residual information - i.e., the gap between mutual
information and G\'acs-K\""orner common information, a new information
inequality for 3-party protocols, and the idea of distribution switching by
which lower bounds computed under certain worst-case scenarios can be shown to
apply for the general case.
  Using these techniques we obtain tight bounds on communication complexity by
MPC protocols for various interesting functions. In particular, we show
concrete functions that have ""communication-ideal"" protocols, which achieve the
minimum communication simultaneously on all links in the network. Also, we
obtain the first explicit example of a function that incurs a higher
communication cost than the input length in the secure computation model of
Feige, Kilian and Naor (1994), who had shown that such functions exist. We also
show that our communication bounds imply tight lower bounds on the amount of
randomness required by MPC protocols for many interesting functions.

Modern high resolution observations allow to view closer into the
objects powering relativistic jets. This is especially the case for SS433, an
X-ray binary from which a precessing jet is observed down to the sub-parsec
scale.
  Aims. We want to study full 3D dynamics of relativistic jets associated with
AGN or XRB. We study the precessing motion of a jet as a model for the jet
associated with the XRB SS433. Our study of the jet dynamics in this system
focuses on the sub-parsec scales. We investigate the impact of jet precession
and the variation of the Lorentz factor of the injected matter on the general
3D jet dynamics and its energy transfer to the surrounding medium. We realize
synthetic radio mapping of the data, to compare our results with observations.
  Methods. For our study we use the code MPI-AMRVAC with SRHD model of a
baryonic jet. We use a AMR scheme and an inner time-dependent boundary
prescription to inject the jets. Parameters extracted from observations were
used. 3D jet realizations that match the SS433 jet are intercompared. We track
the energy content, as deposited in different regions of the domain affected by
the jet. Our code also follows a population of particles injected with the jet.
This evolving energy spectrum of accelerated electrons, allows to obtain the
radio emission from our simulation.
  Results. we obtain meaningful observations. We find increased energy transfer
for a precessing jet compared to a standing jets. We obtain synthetic radio
maps for all jets.
  Conclusions. The synthetic radio map matches best for a model using the
canonical kinematic model. Overdense precessing jets experience significant
deceleration in their propagation through the ISM, and while the overall jet is
of helical shape. This argument show that the kinematic model for SS433
assuming ballistic propagation has to be corrected for this decelretaion.

expressed in terms of known critical exponents. Furthermore, our simulations
reveal that the bulk of the spectrum exhibits a clearly different behavior and
suggest that it belongs to a possibly unique universality class, which has,

derivative is expected to provide information about convective core's
properties and stellar age. The main goal of this work is to study the
potential of the diagnostic tools with regards to the inference of stellar age
and stellar core's properties. For that, we computed diagnostic tools and their
frequency derivatives from the oscillation frequencies of main-sequence models
with masses between 1.0 and $1.6\,{\rm\,M}_{\odot}$ and with different physics.
We considered the dependence of the diagnostic tools on stellar age and on the
size of the relative discontinuity in the squared sound speed at the edge of
the convectively unstable region. We find that the absolute value of the
frequency derivatives of the diagnostic tools increases as the star evolves on
the main sequence. The fraction of stellar main-sequence evolution for models
with masses $>1.2\,{\rm\,M}_{\odot}$ may be estimated from the frequency
derivatives of two of the diagnostic tools. For lower mass models, constraints
on the convective core's overshoot can potentially be derived based on the
analysis of the same derivatives. For at least 35 per cent of our sample of
stellar models the frequency derivative of the diagnostic tools takes its
maximum absolute value on the frequency range where observed oscillations may
be expected.

light signal. The staggered magnetization reveals itself in the magnetic Bragg
peaks of the individual spin components. These magnetic peaks, however, can be
considerably suppressed in the absence of a true long-range antiferromagnetic
order. The light scattered outside the diffraction orders can be collected by a
lens a with highly improved signal-to-shot-noise ratio when the diffraction
maxima are blocked. The collective and single-particle excitations are
identified in the spectrum of the scattered light. We find that the
spin-conserving and spin-exchanging atomic transitions convey information on
density, longitudinal spin, and transverse spin correlations. The different
correlations and scattering processes exhibit characteristic angular
distribution profiles for the scattered light and, e.g., the diagnostic signal
of transverse spin correlations could be separated from the signal by the
scattering direction, frequency, or polarization. We also analyze the detection
accuracy by estimating the number of required measurements, constrained by the

considerably better convergence properties. Moreover, Pade-related resummations

further develop the limit on the work cost, proving that the heat dissipated is

an Alcock & Paczynski cosmological test, that is, an evaluation of the ratio of

is that it does not depend on the evolution of the galaxies, but only on the
geometry of the universe. However, the redshift distortions produced by the
peculiar velocities of the gravitational infall do also have an influence,
which should be separated from the cosmological effect. We derive the
anisotropic correlation function of sources in three surveys within the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS): galaxies from SDSS-III/Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopy Survey-Data Release 10 (BOSS-DR10), and QSOs from SDSS-II and
SDSS-III/BOSS-DR10. From these, we are able to disentangle the dynamic and
geometric distortions and thus derive the ratio of observed angular size to
radial/redshift size at different redshifts. We also add some other values
available in the literature. Then, we use the data to evaluate which
cosmological model fits them. We used six different models: concordance
Lambda-CDM, Einstein-de Sitter, open-Friedman Cosmology without dark energy,
flat quasi-steady state cosmology, a static universe with a linear Hubble law,

notion of duration and a corresponding time flow which turns out to be the
thermal flow connected to the system. We show that, under some quasi-classical
assumptions on the observer, this flow shows relevant properties of empirical
time and some interesting consequences for Special Relativity are drawn.

that a photon, conveying one radiation energy quantum ""$ h \times$ frequency"",
is spatially extensive and stretches an electromagnetic wave train. A wave
train, hence an energy quantum, can only be emitted by its source gradually. In
both the two processes the wave and ""particle"" attributes of the radiation
field are simultaneously prominent, where an overall satisfactory theory has
been lacking. This paper presents a first principles treatment, in a unified
framework of the classical and quantum mechanics, of the latter process, the
emission of a single radiation quantum based on the dynamics of the
radiation-emitting source, a charged oscillator which is itself extensive
across its confining potential well. During the emission of one single
radiation quantum, the extensive charged oscillator undergoes a continuous
radiation damping and is non-stationary. This process is in this work treated
using a quasi stationary approach, whereby the classical equation of motion,
which directly facilitates the correspondence principle for a particle
oscillator, and the quantum wave equation are established for each sufficiently
brief time interval. As an inevitable consequence of the division of the total
time for emitting one single quantum, a fractional Planck constant $h$ is
introduced. The solutions to the two simultaneous equations yield for the
charged oscillator a continuously exponentially decaying Hamiltonian that is at
the same time quantised with respect to the fractional-$h$ at any instant of
time; and the radiation wave field emitted over time stretches a wave train of
finite length. The total system of the source and radiation field maintains at
any time (integer $n$ times) one whole energy quantum, $h \times$ frequency, in
complete accordance with the notion of quantum mechanics and experiment.

transmission grids. The topology of a power grid, together with its operative
state determine, for the most part, the robustness of the power grid against
cascading failures. Secure electrical power supply requires, together with
careful operation, a robust design of the electrical power grid topology. This
paper investigates the impact of a power grid topology on its robustness
against cascading failures. Currently, the impact of the topology on a grid
robustness is mainly assessed by using purely topological approaches that fail
to capture the essence of electric power flow. This paper proposes a metric,
the effective graph resistance, that relates the topology of a power grid to
its robustness against cascading failures by deliberate attacks, while also
taking the fundamental characteristics of the electric power grid into account
such as power flow allocation according to Kirchoff Laws. Experimental
verification shows that the proposed metric anticipates the grid robustness
accurately. The proposed metric is used to optimize a grid topology for a
higher level of robustness. To demonstrate its applicability, the metric is
applied on the IEEE 118 bus power system to improve its robustness against
cascading failures.

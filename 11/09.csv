inverse fb of data collected with the ATLAS detector in pp collisions at the
LHC at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV. The quantum black holes are assumed to decay into a
lepton (electron or muon) and a jet. In either channel, no event with a
lepton-jet invariant mass of 3.5 TeV or more is observed, consistent with the
expected background. Limits are set on the product of cross sections and
branching fractions for the lepton+jet final states of quantum black holes
produced in a search region for invariant masses above 1 TeV. The combined 95%
confidence level upper limit on this product for quantum black holes with
threshold mass above 3.5 TeV is 0.18 fb. This limit constrains the threshold
quantum black-hole mass to be above 5.3 TeV in the model considered.

and error probability over quasi-static multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
fading channels, with and without channel state information (CSI) at the
transmitter and/or the receiver. The principal finding is that outage capacity,
despite being an asymptotic quantity, is a sharp proxy for the
finite-blocklength fundamental limits of slow-fading channels. Specifically,
the channel dispersion is shown to be zero regardless of whether the fading
realizations are available at both transmitter and receiver, at only one of
them, or at neither of them. These results follow from analytically tractable
converse and achievability bounds. Numerical evaluation of these bounds
verifies that zero dispersion may indeed imply fast convergence to the outage
capacity as the blocklength increases. In the example of a particular $1 \times
2$ single-input multiple-output (SIMO) Rician fading channel, the blocklength
required to achieve $90\%$ of capacity is about an order of magnitude smaller
compared to the blocklength required for an AWGN channel with the same
capacity. For this specific scenario, the coding/decoding schemes adopted in
the LTE-Advanced standard are benchmarked against the finite-blocklength
achievability and converse bounds.

bacterial swarms, at all scales populations of motile organisms display
coherent collective motion. This consistent behavior strongly contrasts with
the difference in communication abilities between the individuals. Guided by
this universal feature, physicists have proposed that solely alignment rules at
the individual level could account for the emergence of unidirectional motion
at the group level. This hypothesis has been supported by agent-based
simulations. However, more complex collective behaviors have been
systematically found in experiments including the formation of vortices,
fluctuating swarms, clustering and swirling. All these model systems
predominantly rely on actual collisions to display collective motion. As a
result, the potential local alignment rules are entangled with more complex,
often unknown, interactions. The large-scale behavior of the populations
therefore depends on these uncontrolled microscopic couplings. Here, we
demonstrate a new phase of active matter. We reveal that dilute populations of
millions of colloidal rollers self-organize to achieve coherent motion along a
unique direction, with very few density and velocity fluctuations. Identifying
the microscopic interactions between the rollers allows a theoretical
description of this polar-liquid state. Comparison of the theory with
experiment suggests that hydrodynamic interactions promote the emergence of
collective motion either in the form of a single macroscopic flock at low
densities, or in that of a homogenous polar phase at higher densities.
Furthermore, hydrodynamics protects the polar-liquid state from the giant
density fluctuations. Our experiments demonstrate that genuine physical
interactions at the individual level are sufficient to set homogeneous active
populations into stable directed motion.

industry. Tori are superb when used for executing applications that require
near-neighbor communications. Nevertheless, they are not so good when dealing
with global communications. Hence, typical 3D implementations have evolved to
5D networks, among other reasons, to reduce network distances. Most of these
big systems are mixed-radix tori which are not the best option for minimizing
distances and efficiently using network resources. This paper is focused on
improving the topological properties of these networks.
  By using integral matrices to deal with Cayley graphs over Abelian groups, we
have been able to propose and analyze a family of high-dimensional grid-based
interconnection networks. As they are built over $n$-dimensional grids that
induce a regular tiling of the space, these topologies have been denoted
\textsl{lattice graphs}. We will focus on cubic crystal lattices for modeling
symmetric 3D networks. Other higher dimensional networks can be composed over
these graphs, as illustrated in this research. Easy network partitioning can
also take advantage of this network composition operation. Minimal routing
algorithms are also provided for these new topologies. Finally, some practical
issues such as implementability and preliminary performance evaluations have

occultation by the main-sequence-like companion of a shock within the binary.
There is no indication of diffuse X-ray emission from a bow shock or pulsar

a more Ising-type spectrum with increasing anisotropy in a finite magnetic

oxygen in the non-molecularly cooled ashes to < 1 Msun, independent of the
mixing in the ejecta. This constraint implies that any progenitor model of
initial mass greater than 20 Msun would be difficult to reconcile with the
observed line strengths. A stellar progenitor of around MZAMS = 15 Msun can
consistently explain the directly measured luminosity of the progenitor star,
the observed nebular spectra, and the inferred pre-supernova mass-loss rate. We
conclude that there is still no convincing example of a Type IIP explosion

Euclidean minimum spanning tree (EMST) problem. Also, the paper introduces
KDS's for maintenance of two well-studied sparse proximity graphs, the Yao
graph and the Semi-Yao graph.
  We use sparse graph representations, the Pie Delaunay graph and the
Equilateral Delaunay graph, to provide new solutions for the proximity
problems. Then we design KDS's that efficiently maintain these sparse graphs on
a set of $n$ moving points, where the trajectory of each point is assumed to be
an algebraic function of constant maximum degree $s$. We use the kinetic Pie
Delaunay graph and the kinetic Equilateral Delaunay graph to create KDS's for
maintenance of the Yao graph, the Semi-Yao graph, all the nearest neighbors,
the closest pair, and the EMST. Our KDS's use $O(n)$ space and $O(n\log n)$
preprocessing time.
  We provide the first KDS's for maintenance of the Semi-Yao graph and the Yao
graph. Our KDS processes $O(n^2\beta_{2s+2}(n))$ (resp.
$O(n^3\beta_{2s+2}^2(n)\log n)$) events to maintain the Semi-Yao graph (resp.
the Yao graph); each event can be processed in time $O(\log n)$ in an amortized
sense. Here, $\beta_s(n)$ is an extremely slow-growing function.
  Our KDS for maintenance of all the nearest neighbors and the closest pair
processes $O(n^2\beta^2_{2s+2}(n)\log n)$ events. For maintenance of the EMST,
our KDS processes $O(n^3\beta_{2s+2}^2(n)\log n)$ events. For all three of
these problems, each event can be handled in time $O(\log n)$ in an amortized

services use multiple loosely consistent replicas of user information to avoid
the high overhead of more tightly coupled synchronization. Periodically, the
information must be synchronized, or reconciled. One can place this problem in
the theoretical framework of {\em set reconciliation}: two parties $A_1$ and
$A_2$ each hold a set of keys, named $S_1$ and $S_2$ respectively, and the goal
is for both parties to obtain $S_1 \cup S_2$. Typically, set reconciliation is
interesting algorithmically when sets are large but the set difference
$|S_1-S_2|+|S_2-S_1|$ is small. In this setting the focus is on accomplishing
reconciliation efficiently in terms of communication; ideally, the
communication should depend on the size of the set difference, and not on the
size of the sets.
  In this paper, we extend recent approaches using Invertible Bloom Lookup
Tables (IBLTs) for set reconciliation to the multi-party setting. In this
setting there are three or more parties $A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_n$ holding sets of
keys $S_1,S_2,\ldots,S_n$ respectively, and the goal is for all parties to
obtain $\cup_i S_i$. This could of course be done by pairwise reconciliations,
but we seek more effective methods.
  Our methodology uses network coding techniques in conjunction with IBLTs,
allowing efficiency in network utilization along with efficiency obtained by
passing messages of size $O(|\cup_i S_i - \cap_i S_i|)$. Further, our approach
can function even if the number of parties is not exactly known in advance, and
in many cases can be used to determine which parties contain keys not in the
joint union. By connecting reconciliation with network coding, we can allow for
substantially more efficient reconciliation methods that apply to a number of
natural distributed computing problems.

likelihood-free Bayesian inference. The term ""likelihood-free"" refers to
problems where the likelihood is intractable to compute or estimate directly,
but where it is possible to generate simulated data $X$ relatively easily given
a candidate set of parameters $\theta$ simulated from a prior distribution.
Parameters which generate simulated data within some tolerance $\delta$ of the
observed data $x^*$ are regarded as plausible, and a collection of such
$\theta$ is used to estimate the posterior distribution $\theta\,|\,X\!=\!x^*$.
Suitable choice of $\delta$ is vital for ABC methods to return good
approximations to $\theta$ in reasonable computational time.
  While ABC methods are widely used in practice, particularly in population
genetics, study of the mathematical properties of ABC estimators is still in
its infancy. We prove that ABC estimates converge to the exact solution under
very weak assumptions and, under slightly stronger assumptions, quantify the
rate of this convergence. Our results can be used to guide the choice of the
tolerance parameter $\delta$.

Diagnostic diagrams involving [FeII] and H$_2$ fluxes indicate that the gas is

shock-heated. On the other hand, the emission line ratios measured in the ``hot

regions. We find no sign of radial gas transport from the ring into the core
region dominated by the AGN. The ring morphology appears disturbed by a radial
outflow of material from the AGN, which is confirmed by the existence of a weak
jet in archival radio maps. However, this jet does not seem to have any
significant effect on the morphology of the large ($\sim$8$\times$10$^7$ solar
masses) reservoir of molecular gas that has accumulated inside the central

and supports a scenario in which star formation is recurrent and episodic in

small, and it does not change the overall dynamics. Therefore, the models,
relying on electrostatic or quasi-static approaches, completely ignore the
magnetic energy stored/produced in the beam. A single piezoelectric beam model
without the magnetic effects is known to be exactly observable and
exponentially stabilizable in the energy space. However, the model with the

stabilizable in the energy space for almost all choices of material parameters.
Moreover, even strong stability is not achievable for many values of the

exactly observable in a space larger than the energy space. Then, by using a
$B^*-$type feedback controller, explicit polynomial decay estimates are
obtained for more regular initial data. Unlike the classical counterparts, this

radial distance, due to a not severe degree of the apparent crowdedness.
Finally, we show that there exists a relation between the degree of photometric

mitigating the discrepancy to establish a cosmic distance scale using RRLs in
resolved stellar populations in the near-field cosmology.

probing the strong-field regime of general relativity (GR). As a consequence,
waveforms that include the presence of deviations from GR have been developed
(e.g. in the parametrized post-Einsteinian approach). TIGER, a data analysis
pipeline which builds Bayesian evidence to support or question the validity of
GR, has been written and tested. In particular, it was shown recently that data
from the LIGO and Virgo detectors will allow to detect deviations from GR
smaller than can be probed with Solar System tests and pulsar timing
measurements or not accessible with conventional tests of GR. However, evidence
from several detections is required before a deviation from GR can be
confidently claimed. An interesting consequence is that, should GR not be the
correct theory of gravity in its strong field regime, using standard GR
templates for the matched filter analysis of interferometer data will introduce
biases in the gravitational wave measured parameters with potentially
disastrous consequences on the astrophysical inferences, such as the
coalescence rate or the mass distribution. We consider three heuristic possible
deviations from GR and show that the biases introduced by assuming GR's
validity manifest in various ways. The mass parameters are usually the most
affected, with biases that can be as large as $30$ standard deviations for the
symmetric mass ratio, and nearly one percent for the chirp mass, which is
usually estimated with sub-percent accuracy. We conclude that statements about
the nature of the observed sources, e.g. if both objects are neutron stars,
depend critically on the explicit assumption that GR it the right theory of

SQUID acts as an inductance, the Josephson inductance, whereas a flux-pumped
SQUID develops an additional, parallel element which we have coined the
``pumpistor.'' Parametric gain can be understood as a result of a negative
resistance of the pumpistor. In the degenerate case, the gain is sensitive to
the relative phase between the pump and signal. In the nondegenerate case, gain
is independent of this phase.
  We develop our models first for degenerate parametric pumping in the
three-wave and four-wave cases, where the pump frequency is either twice or
equal to the signal frequency, respectively. We then derive expressions for the
nondegenerate case where the pump frequency is not a multiple of the signal
frequency, where it becomes necessary to consider idler tones which develop.
For the nondegenerate three-wave case, we present an intuitive picture for a
parametric amplifier containing a flux-pumped SQUID where current at the signal
frequency depends upon the load impedance at an idler frequency. This
understanding provides insight and readily testable predictions of circuits
containing flux-pumped SQUIDs.

focus in particular on viable scenarios where the right-handed up-type quarks
have a sizable mixing with the strong dynamics. For concreteness we assume the
latter to be characterized by an SO(5)/SO(4) symmetry with fermionic resonances
in the SO(4) singlet and fourplet representations. Singlet partners dominantly
decay to a Higgs boson and jets. As no dedicated searches are currently looking
for these final states, singlet partners can still be rather light. Conversely,
some fourplet partners dominantly decay to an electroweak gauge boson and a
jet, a signature which has been analyzed at the LHC. To constrain the parameter
space of this scenario we have reinterpreted various LHC analyses. In the limit
of first two generation degeneracy, as in minimal flavor violation or
U(2)-symmetric flavor models, fourplet partners need to be relatively heavy,
with masses above 1.8 TeV, or the level of compositeness needs to be rather
small. The situation is rather different in models that deviate from the first
two generation degeneracy paradigm, as the charm parton distribution functions
are suppressed relative to the up quark ones. The right-handed charm quark can
be composite and its partners being as light as 600 GeV, while the right-handed
up quark needs either to be mostly elementary or to have its partners as heavy
as 2 TeV. Models with fully composite singlet fermions are also analyzed,
leading to similar conclusions. Finally, we consider the case where both the
fourplet and the singlet states are present. In this case the bounds could be
significantly weaken due to a combination of smaller production rates and the
opening of new channels including cascade processes.

multi-phase ISM (molecular through hot) and stellar feedback. The stellar
feedback inputs (energy, momentum, mass, and metal fluxes) are taken directly
from stellar population models. These sources of stellar feedback, with zero
adjusted parameters, reproduce the observed relation between stellar and halo
mass up to M_halo~10^12 M_sun (including dwarfs, satellites, MW-mass disks, and
small groups). By extension, this leads to reasonable agreement with the
stellar mass function for M_star<10^11 M_sun. We predict weak redshift
evolution in the M_star-M_halo relation, consistent with current constraints to
z>6. We find that the M_star-M_halo relation is insensitive to numerical
details, but is sensitive to the feedback physics. Simulations with only
supernova feedback fail to reproduce the observed stellar masses, particularly
in dwarf and high-redshift galaxies: radiative feedback (photo-heating and
radiation pressure) is necessary to disrupt GMCs and enable efficient coupling
of later supernovae to the gas. Star formation rates agree well with the
observed Kennicutt relation at all redshifts. The galaxy-averaged Kennicutt
relation is very different from the numerically imposed law for converting gas
into stars in the simulation, and is instead determined by self-regulation via
stellar feedback. Feedback reduces star formation rates considerably and
produces a reservoir of gas that leads to rising late-time star formation
histories significantly different from the halo accretion history. Feedback
also produces large short-timescale variability in galactic SFRs, especially in
dwarfs. Many of these properties are not captured by common 'sub-grid' galactic
wind models.

to the outer core. The same can true for any $q$-dependent coupling, if the
dark matter mass lies within some specific range for each coupling. This effect
can complement direct searches for dark matter; combining these results with
state-of-the-art Solar simulations should greatly increase sensitivity to
certain DM models. It also seems possible that the so-called Solar Abundance
Problem could be resolved by enhanced energy transport in the solar core due to
such velocity- or momentum-dependent scatterings.

stripping of satellite galaxies and (2) relaxation processes that take place
during galaxy mergers. The fraction of ICL in groups and clusters predicted by

and no halo mass dependence. We note, however, that our predicted ICL fractions
depend on the resolution: for a set of simulations with particle mass one order
of magnitude larger than that adopted in the high resolution runs used in our
study, we find that the predicted ICL fractions are ~30-40 per cent larger than
those found in the high resolution runs. On cluster scale, large part of the
scatter is due to a range of dynamical histories, while on smaller scale it is
driven by individual accretion events and stripping of very massive satellites,
$M_{*} \gtrsim 10^{10.5} M_{\odot}$, that we find to be the major contributors
to the ICL. The ICL in our models forms very late (below $z\sim 1$), and a
fraction varying between 5 and 25 per cent of it has been accreted during the

multi-group membership model for dynamic networks. Our model contains three
main components: We model the birth and death of individual groups with respect

Factorial Hidden Markov model. And, we explain the dynamics of the network

through these alternative operators does not substantially reduce the tension
between the signals and the null constraints for operators where at least two

efficiency that lies at the $-1 \sigma$ region of the Manzur et al measurement
relieves tension between signals and the LUX constraint---in particular for a
magnetic dipole interaction and a xenophobic interaction (though for the latter
the signal regions do not substantially overlap). We also find that modest
changes in the halo model does not alter this result. We conclude that, even
relaxing the assumption about the type of elastic scattering interaction and
taking a conservative choice for the scintillation efficiency, LUX and the
results from other null experiments remain in tension with a light DM elastic
scattering explanation of direct detection anomalies.

atmospheric modelling of the environment). Within the same numerical scheme
ENDGame supports solution to the dynamical equations under varying degrees of
simplification. We present results from a simple, shallow (in atmospheric
domain) hot Jupiter model (SHJ), and a more realistic (with a deeper
atmosphere) HD 209458b test case. For both test cases we find that the
large--scale, time--averaged (over the 1200 days prescribed test period),
dynamical state of the atmosphere is relatively insensitive to the level of
simplification of the dynamical equations. However, problems exist when
attempting to reproduce the results for these test cases derived from other
models. For the SHJ case the lower (and upper) boundary intersects the dominant
dynamical features of the atmosphere meaning the results are heavily dependent
on the boundary conditions. For the HD 209458b test case, when using the more
complete dynamical models, the atmosphere is still clearly evolving after 1200
days, and in a transient state. Solving the complete (deep atmosphere and
non--hydrostatic) dynamical equations allows exchange between the vertical and
horizontal momentum of the atmosphere, via Coriolis and metric terms.
Subsequently, interaction between the upper atmosphere and the deeper more
slowly evolving (radiatively inactive) atmosphere significantly alters the
results, and acts over timescales longer than 1200 days.

model representing concentrations of criminal activity. More precisely, for the
one-dimensional system, we rigorously prove the existence of steady states with
multiple spikes of the following types:
  (i) Multiple spikes of arbitrary number having the same amplitude (symmetric
spikes),
  (ii) Multiple spikes having different amplitude for the case of one large and
one small spike (asymmetric spikes).
  We use an approach based on Liapunov-Schmidt reduction and extend it to the
quasilinear crime hotspot model. Some novel results that allow us to carry out
the Liapunov-Schmidt reduction are: (i) approximation of the quasilinear crime
hotspot system on the large scale by the semilinear Schnakenberg model, (ii)
estimate of the spatial dependence of the second component on the small scale
which is dominated by the quasilinear part of the system.
  The paper concludes with an extension to the anisotropic case.

complexity but not maximal prefix-free complexity. The proof uses Levin's
symmetry of information, Levin's formula relating plain and prefix complexity
and Gacs' theorem that complexity of complexity given the string can be high.
We argue that the proof technique and results mentioned above are useful to
simplify existing proofs and to solve open questions.
  We present a short proof of Solovay's result [21] relating plain and prefix
complexity: $K (x) = C (x) + CC (x) + O(CCC (x))$ and $C (x) = K (x) - KK (x) +
O(KKK (x))$, (here $CC(x)$ denotes $C(C(x))$, etc.).
  We show that there exist $\omega$ such that $\liminf C(\omega_1\dots

finite, i.e. the infinitely often C-trivial reals are not the same as the
infinitely often K-trivial reals (i.e. [1,Question 1]).
  Solovay showed that for infinitely many $x$ we have $|x| - C (x) \le O(1)$
and $|x| + K (|x|) - K (x) \ge \log^{(2)} |x| - O(\log^{(3)} |x|)$, (here $|x|$
denotes the length of $x$ and $\log^{(2)} = \log\log$, etc.). We show that this
result holds for prefixes of some 2-random sequences.

process. When appropriate utility functions are chosen, the agents' behaviors
express key features of human behavior as predicted by prospect theory

As a proof of principle for the applicability of the new framework we apply it
to quantify human behavior in a sequential investment task. We find, that the
risk-sensitive variant provides a significantly better fit to the behavioral
data and that it leads to an interpretation of the subject's responses which is
indeed consistent with prospect theory. The analysis of simultaneously measured

a weighted hidden maximal query graph based on input query tuples, to capture a

  We compare the power of betting strategies (aka martingales) whose wagers
take values in different sets of reals. A martingale whose wagers take values
in a set $A$ is called an $A$-martingale. A set of reals $B$ anticipates a set
$A$, if for every $A$-martingale there is a countable set of $B$-martingales,
such that on every binary sequence on which the $A$-martingale gains an
infinite amount at least one of the $B$-martingales gains an infinite amount,
too.
  We show that for two important classes of pairs of sets $A$ and $B$, $B$
anticipates $A$ if and only if the closure of $B$ contains $rA$, for some
positive $r$. One class is when $A$ is bounded and $B$ is bounded away from
zero; the other class is when $B$ is well ordered (has no left-accumulation
points). Our results generalize several recent results in algorithmic
randomness and answer a question posed by Chalcraft et al. (2012).

these two concepts led to misunderstandings in past works, where the problem

based on the system state in a given iteration. It is well-known that the
updates can converge to a fixed point if the maximum absolute eigenvalue
(spectral radius) of the $n \times n$ iterative matrix ${\bf{F}}$ is less than
one (i.e. $\rho({\bf{F}})<1$). However, if only a subset of the nodes update
their parameter in an iteration (due to delays or stale feedback) then this
effectively renders the spectral radius of the iterative matrix as one. We
consider matrices of unit spectral radii generated from ${\bf{F}}$ due to
random delays in the updates. We show that if each node updates at least once
in every $T$ iterations, then the product of the random matrices (joint
spectral radius) corresponding to these iterations is less than one. We then
use this property to prove convergence of asynchronous iterative systems.
Finally, we show that the convergence rate of such a system is
$\rho({\bf{F}})\frac{(1-(1-\gamma)^T)^n}{T}$, where assuming ergodicity,
$\gamma$ is the lowest bound on the probability that a node will update in any

that if there is a classical algorithm that can simulate IQP efficiently, the

IQP that are classically efficiently simulatable in the strong sense, by using
exact solvability of certain types of Ising models. Another direction is
applying quantum computational complexity of IQP to investigate (im)possibility
of efficient classical approximations of Ising models with imaginary coupling

whether the accelerating expansion of our universe at present is driven by an
unknown energy component (Dark Energy) or a modification to general relativity
(Modified Gravity). In this paper we study the coupled dark energy models, in
which the quintessence scalar field nontrivially couples to the cold dark
matter, with the strength parameter of interaction $beta$. Using the Planck
data alone, we obtain that the strength of interaction between dark sectors is
constrained as $beta < 0.102$ at $95%$ confidence level, which is tighter than
that from the WMAP9 data alone. Combining the Planck data with other probes,
like the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), Type-Ia supernovae ``Union2.1
compilation'' and the CMB lensing data from Planck measurement, we find the
tight constraint on the strength of interaction $beta < 0.052$ ($95%$ C.L.).
Interestingly, we also find a non-zero coupling $beta = 0.078 pm 0.022$ ($68%$
C.L.) when we use the Planck, the ``SNLS'' supernovae samples, and the prior on
the Hubble constant from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) together. This
evidence for the coupled dark energy models mainly comes from a tension between
constraints on the Hubble constant from the Planck measurement and the local

cloud computing. Achieving such integration through discovery and configuration
of `things' is a challenging task. Towards this end, we propose a Context-Aware

SmartLink, that is capable of discovering sensors deployed in a particular

We address the challenge of heterogeneity using a plug in architecture. Our
prototype tool is developed on an Android platform. Further, we employ the
Global Sensor Network (GSN) as the IoT middleware for the proof of concept

increases the coding opportunity. However, low transmission rate may incur
extra transmission delay, which is intolerable for time critical applications.
We design a novel joint rate selection and wireless network coding (RSNC)

study the pairwise coding and present a polynomial time pairwise coding

paper, we develop a new sparse Bayesian learning method for recovery of

pattern-coupled hierarchical Gaussian prior model is introduced to characterize
the statistical dependencies among coefficients, in which a set of

Unlike the conventional sparse Bayesian learning framework in which each
individual hyperparameter is associated independently with each coefficient, in
this paper, the prior for each coefficient not only involves its own
hyperparameter, but also the hyperparameters of its immediate neighbors. In
doing this way, the sparsity patterns of neighboring coefficients are related
to each other and the hierarchical model has the potential to encourage
structured-sparse solutions. The hyperparameters, along with the sparse signal,
are learned by maximizing their posterior probability via an

required to convert the neutral IGM to a highly ionized state, which supports
the ""photon starved"" scenario discussed by Bolton & Haehnelt. The events during
reionization that lead to this number can generally be described as inside-out,

because it ignores history-dependent terms in the global ionization balance
which are not ignorable. We find that the time-dependent model for the ionized
volume fraction Q_HII is more predictive, but overestimates the redshift of
reionization completion by delta_z~1. We propose a revised formulation of the
time-dependent model which agrees with our simulation to O(1%). Finally, we use

patterning room temperature liquid metal droplets on desired substrate surfaces

generalized purpose and is highly flexible and capable of fabricating
electronic components on any desired target objects, with either flat or rough
surfaces, made of different materials, or different orientations from 1-D to
3-D geometrical configurations. With a pre-designed mask, the liquid metal ink
can be directly deposited on the substrate to form various specific patterns
which lead to the rapid prototyping of electronic devices. Further, extended
printing strategies were also suggested to illustrate the adaptability of the
method such that the natural porous structure can be adopted to offer an
alternative way of making transparent conductive film with an optical
transmittance of 47% and a sheet resistance of 5.167{\Omega}/O. Different from
the former direct writing technology where large surface tension and poor
adhesion between the liquid metal and the substrate often impede the flexible
printing process, the liquid metal here no longer needs to be pre-oxidized to
guarantee its applicability on target substrates. One critical mechanism was
found as that the atomized liquid metal microdroplets can be quickly oxidized
in the air due to its large specific surface area, resulting in a significant
increase of the adhesive capacity and thus firm deposition of the ink to the
substrate. This study established a generalized way for pervasively and
directly printing electronics on various substrates which are expected to be
significant in a wide spectrum of electrical engineering areas.

propose a hybrid GSPH scheme that adds the requisite dissipation by utilizing a
more dissipative Riemann solver for the energy equation. The proposed
modification to the GSPH scheme, and it's improved treatment of the anomaly is
verified for flows with strong shocks in one and two dimensions. The result

optimal strategy for a group of foragers searching for targets distributed
heterogeneously. In our model foragers move on a square lattice containing
immobile but regenerative targets. At any instant a forager is able to detect
only those targets that happen to be in the same site. However, we allow the
foragers to have information about the state of other foragers. A forager who
has not detected any target walks towards the nearest location, where another
forager has detected a target, with probability $\exp{\left(-\alpha d\right)}$,
where $d$ is the distance and $\alpha$ is a parameter. The model reveals that
neither overcrowding ($\alpha\to 0$) nor independent searching

problem that has attracted many studies. However, most existing models are
adapted from biological epidemic ones. Although biological epidemic models can
certainly be adapted to capture some computer virus spreading scenarios
(especially when the so-called homogeneity assumption holds), the problem of
computer virus spreading is not well understood because it has many important
perspectives that are not necessarily accommodated in the biological epidemic
models. In this paper we initiate the study of such a perspective, namely that
of adaptive defense against epidemic spreading in arbitrary networks. More
specifically, we investigate a non-homogeneous
Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) model where the model parameters may
vary with respect to time. In particular, we focus on two scenarios we call
semi-adaptive defense and fully-adaptive} defense, which accommodate implicit
and explicit dependency relationships between the model parameters,
respectively. In the semi-adaptive defense scenario, the model's input
parameters are given; the defense is semi-adaptive because the adjustment is
implicitly dependent upon the outcome of virus spreading. For this scenario, we
present a set of sufficient conditions (some are more general or succinct than
others) under which the virus spreading will die out; such sufficient
conditions are also known as epidemic thresholds in the literature. In the
fully-adaptive defense scenario, some input parameters are not known (i.e., the
aforementioned sufficient conditions are not applicable) but the defender can
observe the outcome of virus spreading. For this scenario, we present adaptive
control strategies under which the virus spreading will die out or will be
contained to a desired level.

Lyapunov exponent of the synchronized system play the key roles in
synchronization analysis of LCODEs with the identity inner coupling matrix. As
an application, we obtain a general sufficient condition guaranteeing directed

handle such a theory, a general conserved current has been constructed under a
condition which decouples higher order curvature part from the field part. This
condition in principle, solves for the scale factor, independently. Thus
cosmological evolution remains independent of the form of the chosen field,

large $U$ limit. We show that the local moment changes dramatically across this
phase transition, challenging the conventional wisdom that local moments are
robust against small perturbations in a Mott insulator. The Hund's coupling
plays an important role in determining the nature of the magnetism. We identify

high-dimensional statistics to date rely primarily on the assumption of
independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples. In this work, we
focus on stable Gaussian processes and investigate the theoretical properties
of $\ell _1$-regularized estimates in two important statistical problems in the
context of high-dimensional time series: (a) stochastic regression with
serially correlated errors and (b) transition matrix estimation in vector
autoregressive (VAR) models. We derive nonasymptotic upper bounds on the
estimation errors of the regularized estimates and establish that consistent
estimation under high-dimensional scaling is possible via
$\ell_1$-regularization for a large class of stable processes under sparsity
constraints. A key technical contribution of the work is to introduce a measure
of stability for stationary processes using their spectral properties that
provides insight into the effect of dependence on the accuracy of the
regularized estimates. With this proposed stability measure, we establish some
useful deviation bounds for dependent data, which can be used to study several
important regularized estimates in a time series setting.

  Regression Testing",,,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  Regression testing is performed to provide confidence that changes in a part
of software do not affect other parts of the software. An execution of all
existing test cases is the best way to re-establish this confidence. However,
regression testing is an expensive process---there might be insufficient
resources (e.g., time, workforce) to allow for the re-execution of all test
cases. Regression test prioritization techniques attempt to re-order a
regression test suite based on some criteria so that highest priority test
cases are executed earlier.
  In this study, we want to prioritize test cases for regression testing based
on the dependency network of faults. In software testing, it is common that
some faults are consequences of other faults (leading faults). Moreover,
dependent faults can be removed if and only if the leading faults have been
removed. Our goal is to prioritize test cases so that test cases that exposed
leading faults (the most central faults in the fault dependency network) in the
system testing phase, are executed first in regression testing.
  We present ComReg, a test case prioritization technique based on the
dependency network of faults. We model a fault dependency network as a directed
graph and identify leading faults to prioritize test cases for regression
testing. We use a centrality aggregation technique which considers six network
representative centrality metrics to identify leading faults in the fault
dependency network. We also discuss the use of fault communities to select an
arbitrary percentage of the test cases from a prioritized regression test
suite. We conduct a case study that evaluates the effectiveness and
applicability of the proposed method.

characterized by outbursts attributed to highly enhanced disk accretion. The
trigger mechanism of EXor outbursts is still debated. One theory requires a
close (sub)stellar companion that perturbs the inner disk and triggers the
onset of the outburst. Here, we study the radial velocity (RV) variations of EX
Lup, the prototype of EXors. We conducted a 5-year RV survey with HARPS and
FEROS. We analyzed the activity of EX Lup by checking the bisector and several
other activity indicators. We complemented the RV data with photometric
monitoring to look for signatures of activity or varying accretion. We found
that the RV of EX Lup is periodic, with stable period, semi-amplitude, and
phase over at least four years of observations. This period is not present in
any of the activity indicators. However, the RV of narrow metallic emission
lines suggest the same period, but with an anti-correlating phase. The observed
absorption line RVs can be fitted with a Keplerian solution around a 0.6 M_Sun
central star with M2 sin i = (14.7 +/- 0.7) M_Jup and eccentricity of e = 0.24.
Alternatively, we attempted to model the observations with a cold/hot stellar
spot as well, but the spot parameters needed to reproduce the RV semi-amplitude
are in contradiction with the photometric variability, making the spot scenario
unlikely. We discuss two possibilities to explain the RV data: a geometry with
two accretion columns rotating with the star, and a single accretion flow
synchronized with the orbital motion of the hypothetical companion. In the
companion scenario, the companion's mass would fall into the brown dwarf
desert, which, together with the unusually small separation would make EX Lup a
unique binary system, with interesting implications on the physical mechanisms
responsible for triggering the outburst.

track the evolution of superconductivity in films as the thickness enters the

describes size effects in ultrathin films coupled to the substrate. We restrict
our study to one-band, crystalline, weakly coupled superconductors with no
impurities. The thin-film substrate/vacuum interfaces are described by a simple
asymmetric potential well and a finite quasiparticle lifetime. Boundary
conditions are chosen to comply with the charge neutrality condition. This
model provides a fair description of experimental results in ultrathin lead
films: on average, the superconducting gap decreases with thickness and it is
always below the bulk value. Clear oscillations, remnants of the shape
resonances, are still observed for intermediate thicknesses. For materials with
a weaker electron-phonon coupling and negligible disorder, a modest enhancement
of superconductivity seems to be feasible. The relaxation of the charge
neutrality condition, which is in principle justified in complex oxide
heterostructures and other materials, would lead to a much stronger enhancement
of superconductivity by size effects.

material. Studies of dust grains in these objects can provide pivotal
information on the mechanisms of planet formation. Dissimilarities in the
spatial distribution of small (micron-size) and large (millimeter-size) dust
grains have recently been pointed out. Constraints on the small dust grains can
be obtained by imaging the distribution of scattered light at near-infrared
wavelengths. We aim at resolving structures in the surface layer of
transitional disks (with particular emphasis on the inner 10 - 50 AU), thus
increasing the scarce sample of high resolution images of these objects. We
obtained VLT/NACO near-IR high-resolution polarimetric differential imaging
observations of SAO 206462 (HD135344B). This technique allows one to image the
polarized scattered light from the disk without any occulting mask and to reach
an inner working angle of 0.1''. A face-on disk is detected in H and Ks bands
between 0.1'' and 0.9''. No significant differences are seen between the H and
Ks images. In addition to the spiral arms, these new data allow us to resolve
for the first time an inner cavity for small dust grains. The cavity size
(about 28 AU) is much smaller than what is inferred for large dust grains from
(sub)mm observations (39 to 50 AU). The interaction between the disk and
potential orbiting companion(s) can explain both the spiral arm structure and
the discrepant cavity sizes for small and large dust grains. One planet may be
carving out the gas (and, thus, the small grains) at 28 AU, and generating a
pressure bump at larger radii (39 AU), which holds back the large grains. We
analytically estimate that, in this scenario, a single giant planet (with a
mass between 5 and 15 Jupiter masses) at 17 to 20 AU from the star is
consistent with the observed cavity sizes.

this work, we develop a closed-form scan statistic for cluster detection of
spatial zero-inflated count data. We apply our methodology to simulated and

deteriorates as the number of zeros increases, producing biased inferences. On

integrals). Another approach is to consider the second Hamiltonian structure on
its own as a tensor conservation law. The latter is more intrinsic as compared
to scalar conservation laws derived from it and, as a rule, it is ""simpler"".
Thus it is natural to ask: can the dynamics of a bi-Hamiltonian system be
understood by studying its Hamiltonian pair, without studying the associated
first integrals?\par In this paper, the problem of stability of equilibria in
bi-Hamiltonian systems is considered and it is shown that the conditions for
nonlinear stability can be expressed in algebraic terms of linearization of the

rotations of a free multidimensional rigid body.

with regard to how third- party applications use sensitive private data.
Unfortunately, it is easy to disguise malware within the boundaries of
legitimately-granted permissions. For instance, granting access to ""contacts""
and ""internet"" may be necessary for a text-messaging application to function,
even though the user does not want contacts transmitted over the internet. To
understand fine-grained application use of permissions, we need to statically
analyze their behavior. Even then, malware detection faces three hurdles: (1)
analyses may be prohibitively expensive, (2) automated analyses can only find
behaviors that they are designed to find, and (3) the maliciousness of any
given behavior is application-dependent and subject to human judgment. To
remedy these issues, we propose semantic-based program analysis, with a human
in the loop as an alternative approach to malware detection. In particular, our
analysis allows analyst-crafted semantic predicates to search and filter
analysis results. Human-oriented semantic-based program analysis can
systematically, quickly and concisely characterize the behaviors of mobile
applications. We describe a tool that provides analysts with a library of the
semantic predicates and the ability to dynamically trade speed and precision.
It also provides analysts the ability to statically inspect details of every
suspicious state of (abstract) execution in order to make a ruling as to
whether or not the behavior is truly malicious with respect to the intent of
the application. In addition, permission and profiling reports are generated to
aid analysts in identifying common malicious behaviors.

transversely isotropic (TI) media are essential for imaging and traveltime
tomography applications. Such solutions, however, suffer from the inherent
higher-order nonlinearity of the TI eikonal equation, which requires solving a
quartic polynomial for every grid point. Analytical solutions of the quartic
polynomial yield numerically unstable formulations. Thus, we need to utilize a
numerical root finding algorithm, adding significantly to the computational
load. Using perturbation theory we approximate, in a first order discretized
form, the TI eikonal equation with a series of simpler equations for the
coefficients of a polynomial expansion of the eikonal solution, in terms of the
anellipticity anisotropic parameter. Such perturbation, applied to the
discretized form of the eikonal equation, does not impose any restrictions on
the complexity of the perturbed parameter field. Therefore, it provides
accurate traveltime solutions even for models with complex distribution of
velocity and anisotropic anellipticity parameter, such as that for the
complicated Marmousi model. The formulation allows for large cost reduction
compared to using the exact TI eikonal solver. Furthermore, comparative tests
with previously developed approximations illustrate remarkable gain in accuracy
in the proposed algorithm, without any addition to the computational cost.

Hamiltonians or Lagrangians have different physical interpretations and are
considered to be independent systems unrelated to each other. However, in this
paper we construct explicitly canonical maps in 1T phase space (including
timelike components, specifically the Hamiltonian) to show that it is
appropriate to regard various 1T-physics systems, with different Lagrangians or
Hamiltonians, as being duals of each other. This concept is similar in spirit
to dualities discovered in more complicated examples in field theory or string
theory. Our approach makes it evident that such generalized dualities are
widespread. This suggests that, as a general phenomenon, there are hidden
relations and hidden symmetries that conventional 1T-physics does not capture,
implying the existence of a more unified formulation of physics that naturally
supplies the hidden information. In fact, we show that 2T-physics in
(d+2)-dimensions is the generator of these dualities in 1T-physics in
d-dimensions by providing a holographic perspective that unifies all the dual
1T systems into one. The unifying ingredient is a gauge symmetry in phase
space. Via such dualities it is then possible to gain new insights toward new
physical predictions not suspected before, and suggest new methods of
computation that yield results not obtained before. As an illustration, we will
provide concrete examples of 1T-systems in classical mechanics that are solved
analytically for the first time via our dualities. These dualities in classical
mechanics have counterparts in quantum mechanics and field theory, and in some
simpler cases they have already been constructed in field theory. We comment on

such objects are powered via thin or slim accretion discs (ADs). We use direct
estimates of the mass accretion rate, Mdot, to show that many currently used
values of Lbol and Ledd are either under estimated or over estimated because
they are based on bolometric correction factors that are adjusted to the
properties of moderately accreting active galactic nuclei (AGN) and do not take
into account the correct combination of BH mass, spin and accretion rate. The
consistent application of AD physics to our sample of Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) AGN leads to the following findings: 1. Even the most conservative
assumption about the radiative efficiency of fast accreting BHs shows that many
of these sources must contain slim ADs. We illustrate this by estimating the
fraction of such objects at various redshifts. 2. Many previously estimated BH
growth times are inconsistent with the AD theory. In particular, the growth
times of the fastest accreting BHs were over estimated in the past by large
factors with important consequences to AGN evolution. 3. Currently used
bolometric correction factors for low accretion rate very massive SDSS BHs, are
inconsistent with the AD theory. Applying the AD set of assumptions to such
objects, combined with standard photoionization calculations of broad emission
lines, leads to the conclusion that many such objects must contain fast
spinning BHs.

Optimization in such systems is crucial - but most existing methods intended to
optimize the performance of multi-user wireless video transmission are
inefficient. Some works (e.g. Network Utility Maximization (NUM)) are myopic:
they choose actions to maximize instantaneous video quality while ignoring the
future impact of these actions. Such myopic solutions are known to be inferior
to foresighted solutions that optimize the long-term video quality.
Alternatively, foresighted solutions such as rate-distortion optimized packet
scheduling focus on single-user wireless video transmission, while ignoring the
resource allocation among the users.
  In this paper, we propose an optimal solution for performing joint
foresighted resource allocation and packet scheduling among multiple users
transmitting video over a shared wireless network. A key challenge in
developing foresighted solutions for multiple video users is that the users'
decisions are coupled. To decouple the users' decisions, we adopt a novel dual
decomposition approach, which differs from the conventional optimization
solutions such as NUM, and determines foresighted policies. Specifically, we
propose an informationally-decentralized algorithm in which the network manager
updates resource ""prices"" (i.e. the dual variables associated with the resource
constraints), and the users make individual video packet scheduling decisions
based on these prices. Because a priori knowledge of the system dynamics is
almost never available at run-time, the proposed solution can learn online,
concurrently with performing the foresighted optimization. Simulation results
show 7 dB and 3 dB improvements in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) over
myopic solutions and existing foresighted solutions, respectively.

cross-understanding. One of the few links is Shivers's $k$-CFA work, which has
advanced the concept of ""context-sensitive analysis"" and is widely known in
both communities.
  Recent results indicate that the relationship between the functional and
object-oriented incarnations of $k$-CFA is not as well understood as thought.
Van Horn and Mairson proved $k$-CFA for $k \geq 1$ to be EXPTIME-complete;
hence, no polynomial-time algorithm can exist. Yet, there are several
polynomial-time formulations of context-sensitive points-to analyses in
object-oriented languages. Thus, it seems that functional $k$-CFA may actually
be a profoundly different analysis from object-oriented $k$-CFA. We resolve
this paradox by showing that the exact same specification of $k$-CFA is
polynomial-time for object-oriented languages yet exponential- time for
functional ones: objects and closures are subtly different, in a way that
interacts crucially with context-sensitivity and complexity. This illumination
leads to an immediate payoff: by projecting the object-oriented treatment of
objects onto closures, we derive a polynomial-time hierarchy of
context-sensitive CFAs for functional programs.

ascending and descending parts of the Blazhko cycle. A hybrid model, consisting
of two component oscillators of the same frequency, is proposed as a means to
fit the data over the entire cycle. One component exhibits a sawtooth-like
velocity waveform while the other is nearly sinusoidal. One method of
generating such a hybrid is presented: a nonlinear model is developed for the
first overtone mode, which, if excited to large amplitude, is found to drop
strongly in frequency and become highly non-sinusoidal. If the frequency drops
sufficiently to become equal to the fundamental frequency, the two can become
phase locked and form the desired hybrid. A relationship is assumed between the
hybrid mode velocity and the observed light curve, which is approximated as a
power series. An accurate fit of the hybrid model is made to actual Kepler data
for RR Lyr. The sinusoidal component may tend to stabilize the period of the
hybrid which is found in real Blazhko data to be extremely stable. It is
proposed that the variations in amplitude and phase might result from a
nonlinear interaction with a third mode, possibly a nonradial mode at 3/2 the
fundamental frequency. The hybrid model also applies to non-Blazhko RRab stars
and provides an explanation for the light curve bump. A method to estimate the
surface gravity is also proposed.

outbursts in the past. An example is the class of double-double radio galaxies
(DDRGs). However, to follow the evolution of an individual source in real-time
is impossible due to the large time scales involved. Numerical studies provide
a powerful tool to investigate the temporal behavior of episodic jet outbursts
in a (magneto-)hydrodynamical setting. We simulate the injection of two jets
from active galactic nuclei (AGN), separated by a short interruption time.
Three different jet models are compared. We find that an AGN jet outburst cycle
can be divided into four phases. The most prominent phase occurs when the
restarted jet is propagating completely inside the hot and inflated cocoon left
behind by the initial jet. In that case, the jet-head advance speed of the
restarted jet is significantly higher than the initial jet-head. While the head
of the initial jet interacts strongly with the ambient medium, the restarted
jet propagates almost unimpeded. As a result, the restarted jet maintains a
strong radial integrity. Just a very small fraction of the amount of shocked

  operators",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we push forward the idea of machine learning systems whose
operators can be modified and fine-tuned for each problem. This allows us to
propose a learning paradigm where users can write (or adapt) their operators,
according to the problem, data representation and the way the information
should be navigated. To achieve this goal, data instances, background
knowledge, rules, programs and operators are all written in the same functional
language, Erlang. Since changing operators affect how the search space needs to
be explored, heuristics are learnt as a result of a decision process based on
reinforcement learning where each action is defined as a choice of operator and
rule. As a result, the architecture can be seen as a 'system for writing
machine learning systems' or to explore new operators where the policy reuse
(as a kind of transfer learning) is allowed. States and actions are represented
in a Q matrix which is actually a table, from which a supervised model is
learnt. This makes it possible to have a more flexible mapping between old and
new problems, since we work with an abstraction of rules and actions. We
include some examples sharing reuse and the application of the system gErl to
IQ problems. In order to evaluate gErl, we will test it against some structured
problems: a selection of IQ test tasks and some experiments on some structured
prediction problems (list patterns).

heterotic string theory, which is characterized by a parameter $\alpha$, is
studied in detail in this paper. Since it is possible to write this space-time
in the Einstein frame, we perform a quantitative analysis of the time-like
geodesics by means of the standard Lagrange procedure. Thus, we obtain and
solve a set of differential equations and then we describe the orbits in terms
of the elliptic $\wp$-Weierstra{\ss} function. Also, by making an elementary
derivation developed by Cornbleet (Am. J. Phys. \textbf{61} 7, (1993) 650 -
651) we obtain the correction to the angle of advance of perihelion to first
order in $\alpha$, and thus, by comparing with Mercury's data we give an
estimation for the value of this parameter, which yields an {\it heterotic
solar charge} $Q_{\odot}\simeq 0.728\,[\textrm{Km}]= 0.493\, M_{\odot}$.

magnitudes at different energies due to the small volume of phase space near
the ground state. Consequently, the traditional Wang-Landau sampling which uses
the same trial move for all energies faces difficulties sampling the low
entropic states. We developed an adaptive variant of the Wang-Landau algorithm
that very effectively samples the density of states of continuous models across
the entire energy range. By extending the acceptance ratio method of Bouzida,
Kumar, and Swendsen such that the step size of the trial move and acceptance
rate are adapted in an energy-dependent fashion, the random walker efficiently
adapts its sampling according to the local phase space structure. The
Wang-Landau modification factor is also made energy-dependent in accordance
with the step size, enhancing the accumulation of the density of states.
Numerical simulations show that our proposed method performs much better than
the traditional Wang-Landau sampling.

of the ball. Collisions occur when a ball is placed in an urn which already

sequentially coloring a complete $q$-partite graph wherein a collision
corresponds to the appearance of a monochromatic edge. Using a Poisson
embedding technique, the limiting distribution of the first collision time is
determined and the possible limits are explicitly described. Joint distribution
of successive collision times and multi-fold collision times are also derived.
The results can be used to obtain the limiting distributions of running times
in various birthday problem based algorithms for solving the discrete logarithm

firstly, it does not rely on any additional hypothesis on the regularity of the

not achieved in previous works. Moreover, the central argument of our method

$a$, the size of the shadow decreases with the dilaton parameter $b$. The
distortion of the shadow monotonically increases with $b$ and takes its maximal
when the black hole approaches to the extremal case. Due to the optical
properties, the area of the black hole shadow is supposed to equal to the
high-energy absorption cross section. Based on this assumption, the energy
emission rate is investigated. For a naked singularity, the shadow has a dark

explained by the inflaton mass of order $10^{13}$GeV, which is close to the
right-handed neutrino mass scale suggested by the seesaw mechanism and the
neutrino oscillation experiments. We find that the agreement of the two scales
becomes even better in the neutrino mass anarchy. We show that the inflation
model can be embedded into supergravity and discuss thermal history of the
Universe after inflation such as non-thermal leptogenesis by the right-handed
sneutrino decays and the modulus dynamics.

  Approximation of a PDE Model Arising in a 3-D Fluid-Structure Interation",,,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We will present qualitative and numerical results on a partial differential
equation (PDE) system which models a certain fluid-structure dynamics. The
wellposedness of this PDE model is established by means of constructing for it
a nonstandard semigroup generator representation; this representation is
essentially accomplished by an appropriate elimination of the pressure. This
coupled PDE model involves the Stokes system which evolves on a three
dimensional domain $\mathcal{O}$ being coupled to a fourth order plate
equation, possibly with rotational inertia parameter $\rho >0$, which evolves
on a flat portion $\Omega$ of the boundary of $\mathcal{O}$. The coupling on
$\Omega$ is implemented via the Dirichlet trace of the Stokes system fluid
variable - and so the no-slip condition is necessarily not in play - and via
the Dirichlet boundary trace of the pressure, which essentially acts as a
forcing term on this elastic portion of the boundary. We note here that
inasmuch as the Stokes fluid velocity does not vanish on $\Omega$, the pressure
variable cannot be eliminated by the classic Leray projector; instead, the
pressure is identified as the solution of a certain elliptic boundary value
problem. Eventually, wellposedness of this fluid-structure dynamics is attained
through a certain nonstandard variational (``inf-sup"") formulation.
Subsequently we show how our constructive proof of wellposedness naturally
gives rise to a certain mixed finite element method for numerically
approximating solutions of this fluid-structure dynamics.

red clumps and the spatial distribution of H\alpha emission suggest that dusty
star-formation activity is probably occurring in the nuclear red clumps. A gas
supply to a bulge component through the clump migration is one of the most
potent physical processes to produce such dusty star-forming clumps and form
massive bulges in local early-type galaxies. They would become large quiescent
galaxies at later times just by consumption or blowout of remaining gas. Also,
while most of the HAEs have extended disks, we observe two massive, compact
HAEs, whose stellar surface densities are significantly higher. They are likely
to be the direct progenitors of massive, compact quiescent galaxies at
z=1.5-2.0. Two evolutionary paths to massive quiescent galaxies are devised to
account for both the size growth of quiescent galaxies and their increased

insulating perovskite transition metal oxides (orthorhombic YTiO$_3$,
LaMnO$_3$, and YVO$_3$, as well as monoclinic YVO$_3$), carrying a net
ferromagnetic (FM) moment in the ground state. For these purposes, we use an
effective Hubbard-type model, derived from the first-principles
electronic-structure calculations and describing the behavior of magnetically
active states near the Fermi level. The solution of this model in the
mean-field Hartree-Fock approximation with the relativistic spin-orbit coupling
typically gives us a distribution of the local orbital magnetic moments, which
are related to the site-diagonal part of the density matrix $\hat{\cal D}$ by
the ""standard"" expression $\boldsymbol{\mu}^0 = - \mu_{\rm B} \mathrm{Tr} \{
\hat{\textbf{L}} \hat{\cal D} \}$ and which are usually well quenched by the
crystal field. In this work, we evaluate ""itinerant"" corrections $\Delta
\boldsymbol{\cal M}$ to the net FM moment, suggested by the modern theory. We
show that these corrections are small and in most cases can be neglected.
Nevertheless, the most interesting aspect of our analysis is that, even for
these compounds, which are typically regarded as normal Mott insulators, the
""itinerant"" corrections reveal a strong $\textbf{k}$-dependence in the
reciprocal space, following the behavior of Chern invariants. Therefore, the
small value of $\Delta \boldsymbol{\cal M}$ is the result of strong cancelation
of relatively large contributions, coming from different parts of the Brillouin
zone. We discuss details as well as possible implications of this cancelation,
which depends on the crystal structure as well as the type of the magnetic
ground state.

change are eliminated in the governing equations. In the second approach, which
is a two-step scheme, separate transport equations for liquid water and vapor
water are used, and no conversion between water vapor and liquid water is
allowed in the first step, while in the second step a saturation adjustment
procedure is performed that correctly allocates the water into its two phases

are first validated by comparing to a well-established benchmark problem.
Particular attention is then paid to the effect of changing the time scale at
which the moist variables are adjusted to the saturation requirements in two
different variations of the two-step scheme. This study is motivated by the
fact that when acoustic modes are integrated separately in time (neglecting
phase change related phenomena), or when sound-proof equations are integrated,
the time scale for imposing saturation adjustment is typically much larger than
the numerical one related to the acoustics.

market volatility in a continuous double auction market. We describe the
behavior when some uninformed agents, who we call switchers, decide whether or
not to pay for information before they trade. By paying for the information
they behave as informed traders. First we verify that our model is able to
reproduce some of the stylized facts in real financial markets. Next we
consider the relationship between switching and the market volatility under
different structures of investors. We find that there exists a positive
relationship between the market volatility and the percentage of switchers. We
therefore conclude that the switchers are a destabilizing factor in the market.
However, for a given fixed percentage of switchers, the proportion of switchers
that decide to buy information at a given moment of time is negatively related
to the current market volatility. In other words, if more agents pay for
information to know the fundamental value at some time, the market volatility
will be lower. This is because the market price is closer to the fundamental
value due to information diffusion between switchers.

constructing predictive models of human lifespan based on various features
which can easily be extracted from genealogy datasets.
  We have evaluated the presented methods and algorithms on a large online

all of which were collected from the WikiTree website. Our findings indicate
that significant but small positive correlations exist between the parents'
lifespan and their children's lifespan. Additionally, we found slightly higher

discovered a very small positive and significant correlation between longevity
and reproductive success in males, and a small and significant negative
correlation between longevity and reproductive success in females. Moreover,
our machine learning algorithms presented better than random classification
results in predicting which people who outlive the age of 50 will also outlive
the age of 80.

wave formed by matching the periodicity of the crossing array to the difference
in propagation constants of the 1$^\text{st}$- and 3$^\text{rd}$-order TE-like

points acts like a periodic imaginary-permittivity perturbation that couples
two supermodes, which results in imaginary (radiative) propagation-constant

This type of crossing array provides a robust implementation of a key component
enabling dense photonic integration.

overcome this barrier and develop a scheme to realize the discrete time QW by
placing a pair of superconducting qubits on each site of a 1D lattice and
treating an excitation as a walker. It is also shown that lattice disorders can
be introduced and fully controlled within this scheme by tuning the qubit
parameters. We observe a distinct signature of transition from the ballistic
regime to a localized QW with an increasing strength of disorder. Finally, an
eight-qubit experiment is proposed where the signature of localized and
delocalized regimes can be detected with existing superconducting technology.

holes (MBHs) observed in galactic nuclei today have grown from coalescence of
massive black hole binaries (MBHB) after galaxy merging. Once the components of
a MBHB become gravitationally bound, strong three-body encounters between the
MBHB and stars dominate its evolution in a ""dry"" gas free environment, and
change the MBHB's energy and angular momentum (semi-major axis, eccentricity
and orientation). Here we present high accuracy direct N-body simulations of
spherical and axisymmetric (rotating) galactic nuclei with order a million
stars and two massive black holes that are initially unbound. We analyze the
properties of the ejected stars due to slingshot effects from three-body
encounters with the MBHB in detail. Previous studies have investigated the
eccentricity and energy changes of MBHs using approximate models or Monte-Carlo
three body scatterings. We find general agreement with the average results of
previous semi-analytic models for spherical galactic nuclei, but our results
show a large statistical variation. Our new results show many more phase space
details of how the process works, and also show the influence of stellar system
rotation on the process. We detect that the angle between the orbital plane of
the MBHBs and that of the stellar system (when it rotates) influences the
phase-space properties of the ejected stars. We also find that massive MBHB
tend to switch stars with counter-rotating orbits into co-rotating orbits
during their interactions.

inserting an object similar to the virus allowing them to learn to recognize

sampling at single points as in the classical Shannon sampling framework. Using
the frame theory, one can completely reconstruct a bandlimited function from
its suitably-chosen average sample data. When only finitely many sample data
are available, truncating the complete reconstruction series with the standard
dual frame results in very slow convergence. We present in this note a method
of reconstructing a bandlimited function from finite average oversampling with

resource while suppressing the noise. NMR techniques are challenging: the group
III and V isotopes have large spins with widely different gyromagnetic ratios;
in strained material there are large atom-dependent quadrupole shifts; and
nanoscale NMR is hard to detect. We report NMR on 100,000 nuclear spins of a
quantum dot using chirped radiofrequency pulses. Following polarization, we
demonstrate a reversal of the nuclear spin. We can flip the nuclear spin back
and forth a hundred times.We demonstrate that chirped NMR is a powerful way of
determining the chemical composition, the initial nuclear spin temperatures and
quadrupole frequency distributions for all the main isotopes. The key
observation is a plateau in the NMR signal as a function of sweep rate: we
achieve inversion at the first quantum transition for all isotopes
simultaneously. These experiments represent a generic technique for
manipulating nanoscale inhomogeneous nuclear spin ensembles and open the way to
probe the coherence of such mesoscopic systems.

Consequently, there is need for efficient optimization procedures for

submodular minimization is challenging, we propose a new method that exploits
existing decomposability of submodular functions. In contrast to previous
approaches, our method is neither approximate, nor impractical, nor does it
need any cumbersome parameter tuning. Moreover, it is easy to implement and
parallelize. A key component of our method is a formulation of the discrete
submodular minimization problem as a continuous best approximation problem that
is solved through a sequence of reflections, and its solution can be easily
thresholded to obtain an optimal discrete solution. This method solves both the
continuous and discrete formulations of the problem, and therefore has
applications in learning, inference, and reconstruction. In our experiments, we
illustrate the benefits of our method on two image segmentation tasks.

870-$\mu$m dust emission data. Most of the detected species (SiO, C$_2$H, HNCO,
HCN, HCO$^+$, HNC, HC$_3$N, and N$_2$H$^+$) show spatially extended emission
towards many of the sources. The fractional abundances of the molecules are
mostly found to be comparable to those determined in other recent similar
studies of IRDC clumps. We found that the abundances of SiO, HNCO, and HCO$^+$
are higher in IR-bright clumps than in IR-dark sources, reflecting a possible
evolutionary trend. A hint of such a trend is also seen for HNC and HC$_3$N. An
opposite trend is seen for C$_2$H and N$_2$H$^+$. Moreover, a positive
correlation is found between the abundances of HCO$^+$ and HNC, and between
those of HNC and HCN. The HCN and HNC abundances also appear to increase as a
function of the N$_2$H$^+$ abundance. The HNC/HCN and N$_2$H$^+$/HNC abundance
ratios are derived to be ~1 on average, while that of HC$_3$N/HCN is ~10%. The
N$_2$H$^+$/HNC ratio appears to increase as the clump evolves, while the
HNC/HCO$^+$ ratio shows the opposite behaviour. The detected SiO emission is
likely caused by outflow shocks in most cases, although shocks resulting from
the cloud formation process could also play a role. Shock-origin for the HNCO,
HC$_3$N, and CH$_3$CN emission is also plausible. The average HNC/HCN ratio is
in good agreement with those seen in other IRDCs. Our results support the
finding that C$_2$H can trace the cold gas, and not just the PDRs. The
HC$_3$N/HCN ratio appears to be comparable to that in T Tauri disks and comets.

to an unwieldy ossified Internet architecture resistant to any attempts at

are favored over formal correctness. Fortunately, recent work in the space of
clean slate Internet design---especially, the software defined networking (SDN)
paradigm---offers the Internet community another chance to develop the right

other through a relay node, is a simple but fundamental and practical network
architecture. In this paper, we consider the block fading bidirectional relay
channel and propose efficient transmission strategies that exploit the block
fading property of the channel. Thereby, we consider a decode-and-forward relay
and assume that a direct link between the two users is not present. Our aim is
to characterize the long-term achievable rate region and to develop protocols
which achieve all points of the obtained rate region. Specifically, in the
bidirectional relay channel, there exist six possible transmission modes: four
point-to-point modes (user 1-to-relay, user 2-to-relay, relay-to-user 1,
relay-to-user 2), a multiple-access mode (both users to the relay), and a
broadcast mode (the relay to both users). Most existing protocols assume a
fixed schedule for using a subset of the aforementioned transmission modes.
Motivated by this limitation, we develop protocols which are not restricted to
adhere to a predefined schedule for using the transmission modes. In fact,
based on the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) of the involved
links, the proposed protocol selects the optimal transmission mode in each time
slot to maximize the long-term achievable rate region. Thereby, we consider two
different types of transmit power constraints: 1) a joint long-term power
constraint for all nodes, and 2) a fixed transmit power for each node.
Furthermore, to enable the use of a non-predefined schedule for transmission
mode selection, the relay has to be equipped with two buffers for storage of
the information received from both users. As data buffering increases the
end-to-end delay, we consider both delay-unconstrained and delay-constrained
transmission in the paper.

in the conduction-band and valence-band energy spectra are found and are
identified to be of two types: (1) spurious states which have large
contributions of the bulk solutions with large wave-vectors (the high-k
spurious solutions) and (2) states which originate mainly from the spurious
valley outside the Brillouin zone (the extra-valley spurious solutions). An
algorithm to remove all those nonphysical solutions from the electron and hole

highly suppressed due to the isotropic electrons, a maximum value of $\sim 10\%

explain the polarization of GRB 041219A and GRB 100826A.

stretchable, biocompatible, light-weight, portable, and low cost properties.
Flexible magnetic films are essential for the realization of various

understanding for flexible magnetic films and related devices, we have reviewed
recent advances in the studies of flexible magnetic films including fabrication
methods, magnetic and transport properties of flexible magnetic films, and
their applications in magnetic sensors, actuators, and microwave devices. Three
typical methods were introduced to prepare the flexible magnetic films.
Stretching or bending the flexible magnetic films offers a good way to apply
mechanical strain on magnetic films, so that magnetic anisotropy, exchanged
bias, coercivity, and magnetoresistance can be effectively manipulated.
Finally, a series of examples were shown to demonstrate the great potential of
flexible magnetic films for future applications.

be well modelled by bulk motion beaming of synchrotron self-Compton emission
powered by a low Eddington fraction accretion flow. Nearly 500 of these AGN are
seen in the 2nd Fermi Large Area Telescope catalogue of AGN. We combine the jet
models which describe individual spectra with the expected jet parameter
scalings with mass and mass accretion rate to predict the expected number of
Fermi detected sources given the number densities of AGN from cosmological
simulations. We select only sources with Eddington scaled mass accretion rate
$< 0.01$ (i.e. radiatively inefficient flows), and include cooling, orientation
effects, and the effects of absorption from pair production on the
extragalactic IR background.
  These models overpredict the number of Fermi detected BL Lacs by a factor of
1000! This clearly shows that one of the underlying assumptions is incorrect,
almost certainly that jets do not scale simply with mass and accretion rate.
The most plausible additional parameter which can affect the region producing
the Fermi emission is black hole spin. We can reproduce the observed numbers of
BL Lacs if such relativistic jets are only produced by the highest spin
($a_*>0.8$) black holes, in agreement with the longstanding spin-jet paradigm.
This also requires that high spins are intrinsically rare, as predicted by the
cosmological simulations for growing black hole mass via chaotic (randomly
aligned) accretion episodes, where only the most massive black holes have high
spin due to black hole-black hole mergers.

in galaxies. According to the Unified Model for Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN),
both the X-ray radiation and the prominent broad emission lines, characterizing
the optical and UV spectra of Type 1 AGNs, are originated in the innermost
regions of the sources, close to the Super Massive Black Holes (SMBH), which
power the central engine. Since the emission is concentrated in a very compact
region (with typical size $r < 0.1\,$pc) and it is not possible to obtain
resolved images of the source, spectroscopic studies of this radiation
represent the only valuable key to constrain the physical properties of matter
and its structure in the center of active galaxies. Based on previous studies
on the physics of the Broad Line Region (BLR) and on the X-ray spectra of broad
(FWHMH$_{\rm H\beta}$ > 2000 km/s) and narrow line (1000 km/s < FWHMH$_{\rm
H\beta}\, \leq$ 2000 km/s) emitting objects, it has been observed that the
kinematic and ionization properties of matter close to the SMBHs are related
together, and, in particular, that ionization is higher in narrow line sources.

Type 1 AGNs, selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) database, within
an upper redshift limit of z = 0.35, and detected at X-ray energies. We present

a unique solution for a companion perturbing planet. The authors predicted an
outer non-transiting companion, KOI-142c, with a mass of $0.626\pm 0.03$
M$_{\mathrm{Jup}}$ and a period of $22.3397^{+0.0021}_{-0.0018}\,$days, and
hence close to the 2:1 mean-motion resonance with the inner transiting planet.
We report independent confirmation of KOI-142c using radial velocity
observations with the SOPHIE spectrograph at the Observatoire de
Haute-Provence. We derive an orbital period of $22.10 \pm 0.25\,$days and a
minimum planetary mass of $0.76^{+0.32}_{0.16}\,$ M$_{\mathrm{Jup}}$, both in
good agreement with the predictions by previous transit timing analysis.
Therefore, this is the first radial velocity confirmation of a non-transiting
planet discovered with transit timing variations, providing an independent
validation of the TTVs technique.

uncovering universal laws governing the dynamics of information propagation.
This problem, from the microscopic perspective, is formulated as estimating the
propagation probability that a piece of information propagates from one
individual to another. Such a propagation probability generally depends on two
major classes of factors: the intrinsic attractiveness of information and the
interactions between individuals. Despite the fact that the temporal effect of
attractiveness is widely studied, temporal laws underlying individual
interactions remain unclear, causing inaccurate prediction of information
propagation on evolving social networks. In this report, we empirically study
the dynamics of information propagation, using the dataset from a
population-scale social media website. We discover a temporal scaling in
information propagation: the probability a message propagates between two
individuals decays with the length of time latency since their latest
interaction, obeying a power-law rule. Leveraging the scaling law, we further
propose a temporal model to estimate future propagation probabilities between
individuals, reducing the error rate of information propagation prediction from
6.7% to 2.6% and improving viral marketing with 9.7% incremental customers.

of this source which covers nearly 3 years. We find that it is in a faint
optical state for approximately half the time and shows a series of outbursts
separated by distinct dips in flux. Using data with 1 min sampling, we find
clear evidence that in its low state BOKS 45906 shows a flux variability on a
period of 56.5574+/-0.0014 min and a semi-amplitude of ~3 percent. Since we can
phase all the 1 min cadence data on a common ephemeris using this period, it is
probable that 56.56 min is the binary orbital period. Optical spectra of BOKS
45906 show the presence of Balmer lines in emission indicating it is not an AM
CVn (pure Helium) binary. Swift data show that it is a weak X-ray source and is
weakly detected in the bluest of the UVOT filters. We conclude that BOKS 45906
is a cataclysmic variable with a period shorter than the `period-bounce'

gamma-ray to radio frequencies, together with the new hydrodynamics code of van
Eerten et al. (2012) to test the standard synchrotron shock model. The
evolution of the radio and optical afterglow, with its prominent optical
rebrightening at t_rest 260-2600 s, is remarkably well modelled by a
decelerating jet viewed close to the jet edge, combined with some early
re-energization of the shock. We thus constrain the geometry of the jet with
half-opening and viewing angles of 23 and 21 deg respectively and suggest that
wide jets viewed off-axis are more common in GRBs than previously thought. We
also derive the fireball microphysics parameters epsilon_B=2.4e-4 and
epsilon_e=9.3e-2 and a circumburst density of n=240 cm^-3. The ability to
self-consistently model the microphysics parameters and jet geometry in this
way offers an alternative to trying to identify elusive canonical jet breaks at
late times. The mismatch between the observed and model-predicted X-ray fluxes
is explained by the local rather than the global cooling approximation in the
synchrotron radiation model, constraining the microphysics of particle
acceleration taking place in a relativistic shock and, in turn, emphasising the
need for a more realistic treatment of cooling in future developments of
theoretical models. Finally, our interpretation of the optical peak as due to
the passage of the forward shock synchrotron frequency highlights the
importance of high quality multi-band data to prevent some optical peaks from
being erroneously attributed to the onset of fireball deceleration.

charged-lepton masses are given by the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of the
Higgs doublet field and that of a triplet field. On the other hand, neutrino
masses are generated by two VEVs of triplet Higgs fields. As a result, the
hierarchy between the masses for charged-leptons and neutrinos can be explained
by the triplet VEVs which have to be much smaller than the doublet VEV due to
the constraint from the electroweak rho parameter. We construct a concrete
model to realize this mechanism with discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_4$
symmetries, in which masses for neutrinos and those for the muon and electron
are generated at the one-loop level. As a bonus in our model, the deviation in
the measured muon $g-2$ from the standard model prediction can be explained by
contributions of extra particle loops. Besides, the lightest $\mathbb{Z}_2$-odd
neutral particle can be a dark matter candidate. The collider phenomenology is
also discussed, especially focusing on doubly-charged scalar bosons which are

spectroscopy we present a detailed study of the z=1.803 JKCS041 cluster.
Uniquely, for a high redshift cluster, we confirm a mass of $\log M=14.2$ in
solar units using four different techniques based on the X-ray temperature, the
X-ray luminosity and the cluster richness. JKCS041 is thus a progenitor of a
local system like the Coma cluster. Our rich dataset and the abundant
population of 14 spectroscopically-confirmed red sequence galaxies allows us to
explore the past star formation history of this system in unprecedented detail.
Remarkably, we find a prominent red sequence down to stellar masses as low as
$\log M=9.8$, corresponding to a mass range of 2 dex. These quiescent galaxies
are concentrated around the cluster center with a core radius of 330 kpc. Blue
members are few and avoid the cluster center. In JKCS041 quenching was
therefore largely completed by a look-back time of 10 Gyr and we can constrain
the epoch at which this occurred via spectroscopic age-dating of the individual
galaxies. Most galaxies were quenched about 1.1 Gyr prior to the epoch of
observation. The less massive quiescent galaxies are somewhat younger,
corresponding to a decrease in age of 650 Myr per mass dex, but the scatter in
age at fixed mass is only 380 Myr (at $\log M=11$). The size-mass relation of
quiescent galaxies in JKCS041 is consistent with that observed for local
clusters within our uncertainties. Comparing our data on JKCS041 with 41
clusters at lower redshift, we find that the form of the mass function of red
sequence galaxies has hardly evolved in the past 10 Gyr, both in terms of its
faint end slope and characteristic mass. Despite observing JKCS041 soon after
its quenching and the three fold expected increase in mass in the next 10 Gyr,
it is already remarkably similar to present-day clusters.

fractional and both positive and negative exponents. Posynomial models are
widely used in various engineering design endeavors, such as circuits,
aerospace and structural design, mainly due to the fact that design problems
cast in terms of posynomial objectives and constraints can be solved
efficiently by means of a convex optimization technique known as geometric
programming (GP). However, while quite a vast literature exists on GP-based
design, very few contributions can yet be found on the problem of identifying
posynomial models from experimental data. Posynomial identification amounts to
determining not only the coefficients of the combination, but also the
exponents in the monomials, which renders the identification problem
numerically hard. In this draft, we propose an approach to the identification
of multivariate posynomial models, based on the expansion on a given
large-scale basis of monomials. The model is then identified by seeking
coefficients of the combination that minimize a mixed objective, composed by a
term representing the fitting error and a term inducing sparsity in the
representation, which results in a problem formulation of the ``square-root
LASSO'' type, with nonnegativity constraints on the variables. We propose to
solve the problem via a sequential coordinate-descent scheme, which is suitable
for large-scale implementations.

Since BH has only a few classical degrees of freedom, such a fast measurement

repeatedly collapses the quantum state to the initial one, the state before the
creation of Hawking quanta. By this mechanism, Hawking radiation from a BH of

symmetry that is manifest in the Yukawa sector but broken in the potential.
Thus, one of the doublets breaks the electroweak symmetry and has tree-level
Yukawa couplings to fermions, whereas the other doublet has no vacuum
expectation value and no tree-level couplings to fermions. Since the $Z_2$
parity is broken the two doublets can mix, which leads to a distinct and novel
phenomenology. This Stealth Doublet Model can be seen as a generalization of
the Inert Doublet Model with a broken $Z_2$ symmetry. We outline the model and
present constraints from theory, electroweak precision tests and collider
searches, including the recent observation of a Higgs boson at the LHC. The
charged scalar $H^\pm$ and the CP-odd scalar $A$ couple to fermions at one-loop
level. We compute the decays of $H^\pm$ and $A$ and in particular the one-loop
decays $A \to f \bar{f}$, $H^\pm \to f \bar{f}^\prime $, $H^\pm \to W^\pm Z $
and $H^\pm \to W^\pm \gamma$. We also describe how to calculate and renormalize
such processes in our model. We find that if one of $H^\pm$ or $A$ is the
lightest scalar, $H^\pm \to W^\pm \gamma$ or $ A \to b \bar{b} $ are typically
their respective dominating decay channels. Otherwise, the dominating decays of
$H^\pm$ and $A$ are into a scalar and a vector. Due to the absence of
tree-level fermion couplings for $H^\pm$ and $A$, we consider pair production
and associated production with vector bosons and scalars at the LHC. If the
parameter space of the model that favors $H^\pm \to W^\pm \gamma$ is realized
in Nature, we estimate that there could be a considerable amount of such events
in the present LHC data.

the first unambiguous observational detection of pulsations in this class of

two months by the CoRoT satellite. Independent analyses of the light curve
provides evidence of monoperiodic variations with a frequency of 0.7572 c/d and
a peak-to-peak amplitude of ~2800 ppm. Multisite, ground-based spectroscopic
observations overlapping the CoRoT observations show the star to be a
long-period, single-lined binary. Furthermore, with the notable exception of
mercury, they reveal the same periodicity as in photometry in the line moments
of chemical species exhibiting strong overabundances (e.g., Mn and Y). In
contrast, lines of other elements do not show significant variations. As found
in other HgMn stars, the pattern of variability consists in an absorption bump
moving redwards across the line profiles. We argue that the photometric and
spectroscopic changes are more consistent with an interpretation in terms of
rotational modulation of spots at the stellar surface. In this framework, the
existence of pulsations producing photometric variations above the ~50 ppm
level is unlikely in HD 45975. This provides strong constraints on the
excitation/damping of pulsation modes in this HgMn star.

provide a formal analysis of visualization. It shows how familiar processes of

extends these structures using the tools of category theory to provide a
general framework for understanding visualization in practice, including:
relationships between systems, data collected from those systems, renderings of
those data in the form of representations, the reading of those representations
to create visualizations, and the use of those visualizations to create
knowledge and understanding of the system under inspection. The resulting
framework is validated by demonstrating how familiar information visualization
concepts (such as literalness, sensitivity, redundancy, ambiguity,
generalizability, and chart junk) arise naturally from it and can be defined
formally and precisely. This article generalizes previous work on the formal
characterization of visualization by, inter alia, Ziemkiewicz and Kosara and
allows us to formally distinguish properties of the visualization process that
previous work does not.

that only upper limits or doubtful fluorine abundances with large uncertainties
in M22 RGB stars can be derived. This is probably caused by an incorrect
identification of continuum fluctuations as the HF signature combined with a
wrong correction of the stellar radial velocity. Such continuum fluctuations
could be the consequences of telluric residuals that are still present in the

from the fluorine content of this cluster.

Kelvin-Helmholtz instability to be developed for any sub-Alfvenic motions. The
unstable harmonics correspond to vortices with high azimuthal mode numbers,
which are carried by the flow. Twisted magnetic flux tubes can be unstable to
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability when they move with small speed relative to main

system is driven to a nonequilibrium steady state characterized by a Kolmogorov
energy spectrum. We extract correlation functions of single- and multi-point
quantities and determine their scaling spectrum displaying anomalous scaling
for high-order moments. Varying the external forcing we are able to tune the
system continuously from equilibrium, where the fluctuations are short-range
correlated, to the case where the system is strongly driven in the infrared. In
the latter case the nonequilibrium scaling of small-scale fluctuations are
shown to be universal.

and the averaged law (with respect to the synaptic weights) of the trajectories
of the solutions to the equations of the network of neurons. The main result of
this article is that the image law through the empirical measure satisfies a
large deviation principle with a good rate function which is shown to have a
unique global minimum. Our analysis of the rate function allows us also to
characterize the limit measure as the image of a stationary Gaussian measure
defined on a transformed set of trajectories.

the formation of prebiotic molecules, necessary to the origin of life. Dust
grains submerged in an atmospheric plasma become negatively charged and attract
a flux of ions that are accelerated from the plasma. The energy of the ions
upon reaching the grain surface may be sufficient to overcome the activation
energy of particular chemical reactions that would be unattainable via ion and
neutral bombardment from classical, thermal excitation. As a result, prebiotic
molecules or their precursors could be synthesised on the surface of dust
grains that form clouds in exoplanetary atmospheres. This paper investigates
the energization of the plasma ions, and the dependence on the plasma electron
temperature, in the atmospheres of substellar objects such as gas giant
planets. Calculations show that modest electron temperatures of $\approx 1$ eV
($\approx 10^{4}$ K) are enough to accelerate ions to sufficient energies that
exceed the activation energies required for the formation of formaldehyde,

dynamically from the s-wave interaction of pseudoscalar and vector mesons with
$1/2^+$ and $3/2^+$ baryons. We use a unitary coupled-channels model that
fulfills heavy-quark spin symmetry and respects spin-flavor symmetry in the
light sector. We predict seven N-like and five $\Delta$-like states with masses
around 4 GeV, most of them as bound states. Some of these states form
heavy-quark spin multiplets, which are almost degenerate in mass.

power spectral densities (PSDs) and characterizing the variability of the last
three quarters, we have linked together the individual quarters using a
multiplicative scaling process, providing data sets spanning ~2.8 years with

data sets that yield power law slopes at low frequencies in the approximate
range of -1.5 to -2.0, with white noise seen at higher frequencies. These PSDs
are similar to those of both the individual quarters and to those of ground
based optical observations of other AGN. We also have explored a PSD binning
method intended to reduce a bias toward shallow slope fits by evenly
distributing the points within the PSDs. This tends to steepen the computed PSD
slopes, especially when the low frequencies are relatively poorly fit. We
detected flares lasting several days in which the brightness increased by
~15-20% in one object, as well a smaller flare in another. Two AGN showed only
small, ~1-2%, fluctuations in brightness.

identical length, they are extended by the oscillating sphere to form a tangle
through numerous reconnections. The resulting tangle around the sphere is
anisotropic and affected by the oscillation. The vortex tangle continues to
emit vortex loops, which leave the sphere. The statistics of emitted loops
differ significantly from those of the original injected vortices. First, the
sizes of the emitted loops are widely distributed, ranging from smaller to much
larger than the size of the initial injected loop. Second, the propagation
direction of the emitted loops exhibits anisotropy: Small loops move away
almost isotropically but large ones do so anisotropically along the oscillation
direction of the sphere. Thus, the oscillating object stirs the initial
injected vortices to reproduce a group of vortices with different statistics.
Such physics is compared with the experiments of vibrating objects.

this work, we specifically consider the problem of geospatial information
extraction and representation, where one can exploit diverse sources of
information (such as image and audio data, text data, etc), going beyond
traditional volunteered geographic information. Our ambition is to include
available narrative information in an effort to better explain geospatial
relationships: with spatial reasoning being a basic form of human cognition,
narratives expressing such experiences typically contain qualitative spatial
data, i.e., spatial objects and spatial relationships.
  To this end, we formulate a quantitative approach for the representation of
qualitative spatial relations extracted from UGC in the form of texts. The
proposed method quantifies such relations based on multiple text observations.
Such observations provide distance and orientation features which are utilized
by a greedy Expectation Maximization-based (EM) algorithm to infer a
probability distribution over predefined spatial relationships; the latter
represent the quantified relationships under user-defined probabilistic
assumptions. We evaluate the applicability and quality of the proposed approach
using real UGC data originating from an actual travel blog text corpus. To
verify the quality of the result, we generate grid-based maps visualizing the
spatial extent of the various relations.

contribution of superconducting fluctuations (SCF) to the ab-plane conductivity
above Tc in a series of YBa2Cu3O6+x single crystals. The fluctuation
conductivity is found to vanish nearly exponentially with temperature, allowing
us to determine precisely the field H'c(T) and the temperature T'c above which
the SCFs are fully suppressed. T'c is always found much smaller than the
pseudogap temperature. A careful investigation near optimal doping shows that
T'c is higher than the pseudogap T*, which indicates that the pseudogap cannot
be assigned to preformed pairs. For nearly optimally doped samples, the
fluctuation conductivity can be accounted for by gaussian fluctuations
following the Ginzburg-Landau scheme. A phase fluctuation contribution might be
invoked for the most underdoped samples in a T range which increases when
controlled disorder is introduced by electron irradiation. Quantitative
analysis of the fluctuating magnetoconductance allows us to determine the
critical field Hc2(0) which is found to be quite similar to H'c(0) and to
increase with hole doping. Studies of the incidence of disorder on both T'c and
T* enable us to propose a three dimensional phase diagram including a disorder
axis, which allows to explain most observations done in other cuprate families.

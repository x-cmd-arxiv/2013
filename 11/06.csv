cosmology while supporting the standard cosmological model. However, the
cosmological principle of Universal homogeneity and isotropy has always been in
question, since structures as large as the survey size have always been found
as the survey size has increased. Until now, the largest known structure in our
Universe is the Sloan Great Wall (SGW), which is more than 400 Mpc long and
located approximately one billion light-years away. Here we report the
discovery of a structure at least six times larger than the Sloan Great Wall
that is suggested by the distribution of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Gamma-ray
bursts are the most energetic explosions in the Universe. They are associated
with the stellar endpoints of massive stars and are found in and near distant
galaxies. Therefore, they are very good indicators of the dense part of the
Universe containing normal matter. As of July 2012, 283 GRB redshifts have been
measured. If one subdivides this GRB sample into nine radial parts and compares
the sky distributions of these subsamples (each containing 31 GRBs), one can
observe that the fourth subsample (1.6 < z < 2.1) differs significantly from
the others in that many of the GRBs are concentrated in the same angular area
of the sky. Using the two-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, the significance
of this observation is found to be less than 0.05 per cent. Fourteen out of the
31 Gamma-Ray Bursts in this redshift band are concentrated in approximately 1/8
of the sky. The binomial probability to find such a deviation is p=0.0000055.
This huge structure lies ten times farther away than the Sloan Great Wall, at a
distance of approximately ten billion light-years. The size of the structure
defined by these GRBs is about 2000-3000 Mpc, or more than six times the size
of the largest known object (SGW) in the Universe.

galaxies using the First Billion Years simulation between z=16-6 before secular
evolution sets in. Using a large statistical sample from two simulations of the
same volume and cosmological initial conditions, one with and one without
baryons, we are able to directly compare haloes with their baryon-free
counterparts, allowing a detailed study of the modifications to the dark matter
density profile due to the presence of baryons during the first billion years
of galaxy formation. For each of the ~ 5000 haloes in our sample we quantify
the impact of the baryons using eta, defined as the ratio of dark matter mass
enclosed in 100 pc in the baryonic run to its counterpart without baryons.
During this epoch of rapid growth of galaxies, we find that many haloes of
these first galaxies show an enhancement of dark matter in the halo centre
compared to the baryon-free simulation, while many others show a deficit. We
find that the mean value of eta is close to unity, but there is a large
dispersion, with a standard deviation of 0.677. The enhancement is cyclical in
time and tracks the star formation cycle of the galaxy; as gas falls to the
centre and forms stars, the dark matter moves in as well. Supernova feedback
then removes the gas, and the dark matter again responds to the changing
potential. We study three physical models relating the motion of baryons to
that of the dark matter: adiabatic contraction, dynamical friction, and rapid
outflows. Abridged, see text for full abstract

the adiabatic assumption in coupled-channel calculations, we explore the
possibility of generalizing a global spherical optical model potential (OMP) to
make it usable in coupled-channel calculations on statically deformed nuclei.
The generalization consists in adding the coupling of the ground state
rotational band, deforming the potential by introducing appropriate quadrupole
and hexadecupole deformation and correcting the OMP radius to preserve volume
integral of the spherical OMP. We choose isotopes of three rare-earth elements
(W, Ho, Gd), which are known to be nearly perfect rotors, to perform a
consistent test of our conjecture on integrated cross sections as well as on
angular distributions for elastic and inelastic neutron scattering. When doing
this we employ the well-established Koning-Delaroche global spherical potential
and experimentally determined deformations without any adjustments. We observe
a dramatically improved agreement with experimental data compared to spherical
optical model calculations. The effect of changing the OMP radius to preserve
volume integral is moderate but visibly improves agreement at lower incident
energies. We find that seven collective states need to be considered for the
coupled-channel calculations to converge. Our results for total, elastic,
inelastic, and capture cross sections, as well as elastic and inelastic angular
distributions are in remarkable agreement with experimental data. This result
confirms that the adiabatic assumption holds and can extend applicability of
the global spherical OMP to rotational nuclei in the rare-earth region,
essentially without any free parameter. Thus, quite reliable coupled-channel
calculations can be performed on such nuclei even when the experimental data,
and consequently a specific coupled-channel potential, are not available.

photometry obtained between the years 1987 and 2010 with the T3 0.4 m Automated
Telescope at the Fairborn Observatory. The CPS-method divides data into short
subsets and then models the light curves with Fourier-models of variable orders
and provides estimates of the mean magnitude, amplitude, period and light curve
minima. These light curve parameters are then analysed for signs of activity
cycles, differential rotation and active longitudes. We confirm the presence of
two previously found stable active longitudes, synchronised with the orbital
period $P_{\rm{orb}}=19.60$d and find eight events where the active longitudes
are disrupted. The epochs of the primary light curve minima rotate with a
shorter period $P_{\rm{min,1}}=19.47$d than the orbital motion. If the
variations in the photometric rotation period were to be caused by differential
rotation, this would give a differential rotation coefficient of $\alpha \ge
0.103$. The presence of two slightly different periods of active regions may
indicate a superposition of two dynamo modes, one stationary in the orbital
frame and the other one propagating in the azimuthal direction. Our estimate of
the differential rotation is much higher than previous results. However,
simulations show that this can be caused by insufficient sampling in our data.

photon generation to the multiwavelength emission from the compact regions of

one-zone SSC model for its core emission. Methods: We have calculated
analytically the peak luminosities of the first and second SSC components by,
first, deriving the steady-state electron distribution in the presence of
synchrotron and SSC cooling and, then, by using appropriate expressions for the
positions of the spectral peaks. We have also tested our analytical results
against those derived from a numerical code where the full emissivities and
cross-sections were used. Results: We show that the one-zone SSC model cannot
account for the core emission of Centaurus A above a few GeV, where the peak of
the second SSC component appears. We, thus, propose an alternative explanation
for the origin of the high energy ($\gtrsim 0.4$ GeV) and TeV emission, where
these are attributed to the radiation emitted by a relativistic proton
component through photohadronic interactions with the photons produced by the
primary leptonic component. We show that the required proton luminosities are
not extremely high, e.g. $\sim 10^{43}$ erg/s, provided that the injection
spectra are modelled by a power-law with a high value of the lower energy
cutoff. Finally, we find that the contribution of the core emitting region of

evaluated using known pedigrees, as IBD segments are by definition inherited
without recombination down a family tree. We extracted 25,432 genotyped
European individuals containing 2,952 father-mother-child trios from the
23andMe, Inc. dataset. We then used GERMLINE, a widely used IBD detection
method, to detect IBD segments within this cohort. Exploiting known familial
relationships, we identified a false positive rate over 67% for 2-4 centiMorgan
(cM) segments, in sharp contrast with accuracies reported in simulated data at
these sizes. Nearly all false positives arose from the allowance of haplotype
switch errors when detecting IBD, a necessity for retrieving long (> 6 cM)
segments in the presence of imperfect phasing. We introduce HaploScore, a
novel, computationally efficient metric that scores IBD segments proportional
to the number of switch errors they contain. Applying HaploScore filtering to
the IBD data at a precision of 0.8 produced a 13-fold increase in recall when
compared to length-based filtering. We replicate the false IBD findings and
demonstrate the generalizability of HaploScore to alternative data sources

the phase-separated colossal magnetoresistance Nd2/3Ca1/3MnO3 perovskite has
been carried out. Clear experimental evidence of the cluster-glass magnetic
behavior of this compound has been revealed. Well defined maxima in the
in-phase linear ac susceptibility $\chi ^{/}(T)$ were observed, indicative of
the magnetic glass transition at $T_{g}$ = 60 K. Strongly divergent
zero-field-cooled and field-cooled static magnetizations and frequency
dependent ac susceptibility are evident of the glassy-like magnetic state of
the compound at low temperatures. The frequency dependence of the cusp
temperature Tmax of the $\chi ^{/}(T)$ susceptibility was found to follow the
critical slowing down mechanism. The Cole-Cole analysis of the dynamic
susceptibility at low temperature has shown extremely broad distribution of
relaxation times, indicating that spins are frozen at ""macroscopic"" time scale.
Slow relaxation in the zero-field-cooled magnetization has been experimentally
revealed. The obtained results do not agree with a canonical spin-glass state
and indicate a cluster glass magnetic state of the compound below $T_{g}$,
associated with its antiferromagnetic-ferromagnetic nano-phase segregated
state. It was found that the relaxation mechanisms below the cluster glass
freezing temperature $T_{g}$ and above it are strongly different. Magnetic
field up to about $\mu_{0}$H = 0.4 T suppresses the glassy magnetic state of
the compound.

where the unknown parameter is a field. In practice the unknown field is
discretized resulting in a problem in $\mathbb{R}^N$, with an understanding
that refining the discretization, that is increasing $N$, will often be
desirable. In the context of Bayesian inversion this situation suggests the
importance of two issues: (i) defining hyper-parameters in such a way that they
are interpretable in the continuum limit $N \to \infty$ and so that their
values may be compared between different discretization levels; (ii)
understanding the efficiency of algorithms for probing the posterior
distribution, as a function of large $N.$ Here we address these two issues in
the context of linear inverse problems subject to additive Gaussian noise
within a hierarchical modelling framework based on a Gaussian prior for the
unknown field and an inverse-gamma prior for a hyper-parameter, namely the
amplitude of the prior variance. The structure of the model is such that the
Gibbs sampler can be easily implemented for probing the posterior distribution.
Subscribing to the dogma that one should think infinite-dimensionally before
implementing in finite dimensions, we present function space intuition and
provide rigorous theory showing that as $N$ increases, the component of the
Gibbs sampler for sampling the amplitude of the prior variance becomes
increasingly slower. We discuss a reparametrization of the prior variance that
is robust with respect to the increase in dimension; we give numerical
experiments which exhibit that our reparametrization prevents the slowing down.
Our intuition on the behaviour of the prior hyper-parameter, with and without
reparametrization, is sufficiently general to include a broad class of
nonlinear inverse problems as well as other families of hyper-priors.

be our guideline for the characterization of such planets. But the Earth has
been inhabited for at least 3.8 Ga, and its appearance has changed with time.
Here, we have studied the Earth during the Archean eon, 3.0 Ga ago. At that
time one of the more widespread life forms on the planet were purple bacteria.
These bacteria are photosynthetic microorganisms and can inhabit both aquatic
and terrestrial environments. Here, we used a radiative transfer model to
simulate the visible and near-IR radiation reflected by our planet, taking into
account several scenarios regarding the possible distribution of purple
bacteria over continents and oceans. We find that purple bacteria have a
reflectance spectrum which has a strong reflectivity increase, similar to the
red edge of leafy plants, although shifted redwards. This feature produces a
detectable signal in the disk-averaged spectra of our planet, depending on
cloud amount and on purple bacteria concentration/distribution. We conclude
that by using multi-color photometric observations, it is possible to
distinguish between an Archean Earth in which purple bacteria inhabit vast
extensions of the planet, and a present-day Earth with continents covered by
deserts, vegetation or microbial mats.

BCJ duality between colour and kinematics in gauge theory, and its relation to
gravity. We find that the scattering equations are a consistency condition for
a self-dual-type vertex which is associated to each solution of those
equations. We also identify an extension of the anti-self-dual vertex, such
that the two vertices are not conjugate in general. Both vertices correspond to
the structure constants of Lie algebras. We give a prescription for the use of
the generators of these Lie algebras in trivalent graphs that leads to a
natural set of BCJ numerators. In particular, we write BCJ numerators for each
contribution to the amplitude associated to a solution of the scattering
equations. This leads to a decomposition of the determinant of a certain
kinematic matrix, which appears naturally in the amplitudes, in terms of
trivalent graphs. We also present the kinematic analogues of colour traces,

of a centralized vocabulary, a crowd of users may never manage to reach a
consensus on the description of resources (e.g., books, users or songs) on the
Web. Yet, previous research has provided interesting evidence that the tag
distributions of resources may become semantically stable over time as more and
more users tag them. At the same time, previous work has raised an array of new
questions such as: (i) How can we assess the semantic stability of social
tagging systems in a robust and methodical way? (ii) Does semantic
stabilization of tags vary across different social tagging systems and
ultimately, (iii) what are the factors that can explain semantic stabilization
in such systems? In this work we tackle these questions by (i) presenting a
novel and robust method which overcomes a number of limitations in existing
methods, (ii) empirically investigating semantic stabilization processes in a
wide range of social tagging systems with distinct domains and properties and
(iii) detecting potential causes for semantic stabilization, specifically
imitation behavior, shared background knowledge and intrinsic properties of
natural language. Our results show that tagging streams which are generated by
a combination of imitation dynamics and shared background knowledge exhibit
faster and higher semantic stability than tagging streams which are generated
via imitation dynamics or natural language streams alone.

F-Theory, known as $\cal{F}$-$SU(5)$. We show that through compression of the
light stau and light bino neutralino mass difference, where internal
bremsstrahlung (IB) photons give a dominant contribution, the photon yield from
annihilation of SUSY dark matter can be elevated to a number of events
potentially observable by the Fermi-LAT in the coming years. Likewise, the
increased yield in No-Scale $\cal{F}$-$SU(5)$ may also have rendered the
existing observation of a 133 GeV monochromatic gamma ray line visible, if
additional data should exclude systematic or statistical explanations. The
question of intensity aside, No-Scale $\cal{F}$-$SU(5)$ can indeed provide a
natural weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) candidate with a mass in the
correct range to yield $\gamma \gamma$ and $\gamma Z$ emission lines at
$m_{\chi} \sim 133$ GeV and $m_{\chi} \sim 145$ GeV, respectively.
Additionally, we elucidate the emerging empirical connection between recent
Planck satellite data and No-Scale Supergravity cosmological models which mimic
the Starobinsky model of inflation. Together, these experiments furnish rich
alternate avenues for testing No-Scale $\cal{F}$-$SU(5)$, and similarly
structured models, the results of which may lend independent credence to
observations made at the LHC.

in the investigated range of 10^5<=N<=10^6. Binary hardening rates are also
substantially lower than would be expected if the binary loss cone remained
full, as it would be if the orbits supplying stars to the binary were being
efficiently replenished. The difference in binary hardening rates between the
spherical and nonspherical models is less than a factor of two even in the
simulations with the largest N. By studying the orbital populations of our
models, we conclude that the rate of supply of stars to the binary via draining
of centrophilic orbits is indeed expected to be much lower than the
full-loss-cone rate, consistent with our simulations. We argue that the
binary's evolution in the simulations is driven in roughly equal amounts by
collisional and collisionless effects, even at the highest N-values currently
accessible. While binary hardening rates would probably reach a limiting value
for large N, our results suggest that we cannot approach that rate with
currently available algorithms and computing hardware. The extrapolation of
results from N-body simulations to real galaxies is therefore not

Asterodensity Profiling (AP) compares this density to an independently

ultimately derive useful parameters. Several physical effects can cause said
assumptions to become invalid, with the most well-known example being the
so-called photo-eccentric effect. In this work, we provide analytic expressions
for five other effects which induce AP deviations: the photo-blend, -spot,
-timing, -duration and -mass effects. We find that these effects can easily
reproduce large AP deviations and so we caution that extracting the
eccentricity distribution is only viable with careful consideration of the
prior distributions for these other effects. We also re-investigate the
photo-eccentric effect and derive a single-domain minimum eccentricity
expression and the parameter range for which analytic formulae are valid. This
latter result shows that the assumptions underlying the analytic model for the
photo-eccentric effect break down for close-in, highly-eccentric planets,
meaning that extreme care must be taken in this regime. Finally, we demonstrate
that contaminated light fraction can be solved for, indicating that AP could be

microbial processes. The processes of denitrification and anaerobic ammonium
oxidation (anammox) remove N from estuaries by producing di-nitrogen gas, and
each can be coupled to N recycling pathways such as nitrification and
dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). Environmental conditions in
estuaries influence sedimentary N cycling processes; therefore, seawater
intrusion may affect the coupling of N cycling processes in the freshwater
portions of estuaries. This study investigated the potential effects of
seawater intrusion on these process couplings through a comparative modeling
approach. We applied environ analysis, a form of ecological network analysis,
to two N cycling mass-balance network models constructed at freshwater
(oligohaline) and saltwater (polyhaline) sites in the Cape Fear River Estuary,
North Carolina. We used a space-for-time substitution to predict the effects of
seawater intrusion on the sedimentary N cycle. Further, we conducted an
uncertainty analysis using linear inverse modeling to evaluate the effects of
parameterization uncertainty on model results. Nitrification coupled to both
denitrification and anammox was 2.5 times greater in the oligohaline model,
while DNRA coupled to anammox was 2.7 times greater in the polyhaline model.
However, the total amount of N2 gas produced relative to the nitrogen inputs to
each network was 4.7% and 4.6% at the oligohaline and polyhaline sites,
respectively. These findings suggest that changes in water chemistry from
seawater intrusion may favor direct over coupled nitrogen removal, but may not

with high transition temperature, we find both the dispersive high-energy spin

dominate role in cooper pairing. We find three closely competing types of
pairing symmetries, which take a very simple form in the space of active iron
$3d$ orbitals, and differ only in the relative quantum mechanical phase of the
$xz$, $yz$ and $xy$ orbital contributions. The extensively discussed s$^{+-}$
symmetry appears when contributions from all orbitals have equal sign, while
the opposite sign in $xz$ and $yz$ orbitals leads to the $d$ wave symmetry. A
novel orbital antiphase $s^{+-}$ symmetry emerges when $xy$ orbital has
opposite sign to $xz$ and $yz$ orbitals. We propose that this orbital-antiphase

subgroup of the field Q of rational numbers whose denominators are powers of p.
In this paper, we survey our classification of these C*-algebras up to
*-isomorphism in terms of the multipliers on Z[1/p], using techniques from
noncommutative topology. Our work relies in part on writing these C*-algebras
as direct limits of rotation algebras, i.e. twisted group C*-algebras of the
group Z^2 thereby providing a mean for computing the K-theory of the
noncommutative solenoids, as well as the range of the trace on the K_0 groups.
We also establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the simplicity of
the noncommutative solenoids. Then, using the computation of the trace on K_0,
we discuss two different ways of constructing projective modules over the
noncommutative solenoids.

that identifying purpose is correlated with the related phenomenon of sentiment
and emotion detection, but yet significantly different. Detecting purpose has a
number of applications including detecting the mood of the electorate,
estimating the popularity of policies, identifying key issues of contention,
and predicting the course of events. We create a large dataset of electoral
tweets and annotate a few thousand tweets for purpose. We develop a system that
automatically classifies electoral tweets as per their purpose, obtaining an
accuracy of 43.56% on an 11-class task and an accuracy of 73.91% on a 3-class
task (both accuracies well above the most-frequent-class baseline). Finally, we
show that resources developed for emotion detection are also helpful for
detecting purpose.

factor of >100, a high duty cycle (at least ~70%), and a peak luminosity of Lx
~ 2X10^{39} erg/s (0.2-10 keV, absorbed). In the brightest observation, the
source is similar to typical low-luminosity ULXs, with the spectrum showing a
high-energy cutoff but harder than that from a standard accretion disk. There
are also sporadical short dips, accompanied by spectral softening. In a fainter
observation with Lx ~ 3.6X10^{38} erg/s, the source appears softer and is
probably in the thermal state seen in Galactic black-hole X-ray binaries
(BHBs). In an even fainter observation (Lx ~ 9X10^{37} erg/s), the spectrum is
harder again, and the source might be in the steep-powerlaw state or the hard
state of BHBs. In this observation, the light curve might exhibit ~7 hr
(quasi-)periodic large modulations over two cycles. The source also has a
possible point-like optical counterpart from HST images. In terms of the colors
and the luminosity, the counterpart is probably a G8 supergiant or a compact
red globular cluster containing ~2X10^5 K dwarfs, with some possible weak UV
excess that might be ascribed to accretion activity. Thus our source is a
candidate stellar-mass BHB with a supergiant companion or with a dwarf
companion residing in a globular cluster. Our study supports that some
low-luminosity ULXs are supercritically accreting stellar-mass BHBs.

a favorable environment for planetary formation due to the high heavy-element

density, and corresponding high close-encounter event rate, may induce strong
perturbations of planetary orbits with large semimajor axes. Here we present a
set of N-body simulations implementing a novel scheme to treat the tidal
effects of external stellar perturbers on planetary orbit eccentricity and
inclination. By simulating five nearby open clusters we determine the rate of
occurrence of bodies extracted from their parent stellar system by
quasi-impulsive tidal interactions. We find that the specific free-floating

of the cluster, with a constant of proportionality equal to (23 +/- 5)10^-6

have lost their planets. This raises the exciting possibility of directly
observing these wandering planets with the James Webb Space Telescope in the

interstellar gas. In our method we treat three non-thermal components -
turbulence, magnetic fields and cosmic rays - and effectively parametrize their
amplitude. We assume that the three components settle into a quasi-steady-state
that is governed by the star formation rate, and calibrate their magnitude and
density dependence by the observed Radio-FIR correlation, relating synchrotron
radiation to star formation rates of galaxies. We implement our model in single
cell numerical simulation of a parcel of gas with constant pressure boundary
conditions and demonstrate its effect and potential. Then, the non-thermal
pressure model is incorporated into RAMSES and hydrodynamic simulations of
isolated galaxies with and without the non-thermal pressure model are presented

increasing planet mass producing broader debris rings. We apply our methods to

in the Galactic magnetic field (GMF) may play an important role in the
propagation of UHECRs and their measured anisotropy, particularly when the
transport is anisotropic. To fully account for the discreteness of UHECR
sources in space and time, a Monte Carlo method is used to randomly place
sources in the Galaxy. The low anisotropy measured by Auger is not generally
characteristic of the theoretical models, given that the sources are
distributed in proportion to the star formation rate, but it can possibly be
understood as a) intermittency effects due to the discrete nature of the
sources or, with extreme parameters, b) a cancellation of drift current along a
current sheet with the outward radial diffusive flux. We conclude that it is
possible to interpret the Galactic sub-ankle CR flux as being due entirely to
intermittent discrete Galactic sources distributed in proportion to star
formation, but only with probability of roughly 35 percent, of which the
spectrum is in accord with observations about 30 percent of the time.

stars is analyzed. Two strong shocks propagate at a constant velocity (which is
a small fraction of the velocity of the approaching stars) from the contact
surface toward the center of each star. The shocked region near the contact
surface has a planar symmetry and a uniform pressure. The density vanishes at
the (Lagrangian) surface of contact and the speed of sound diverges there. The
temperature, however, reaches a finite value, since as the density vanishes,
the finite pressure is radiation dominated. For Carbon-Oxygen white dwarfs
collisions this temperature is too low for any appreciable nuclear burning at
early times. The divergence of the speed of sound limits numerical studies of
stellar collisions, as it makes convergence tests exceedingly expensive unless
dedicated schemes are used. We provide a new one-dimensional Lagrangian
numerical scheme to achieve this. Self-similar planar solutions are derived for
zero-impact parameter collisions between two identical stars, under some
simplifying assumptions. These solutions provide rough approximations that
capture the main features of the flow and allow a general study as well as a
detailed numerical verification test problem. The self-similar solution in the
upstream frame is the planar version of previous piston problems that were
studied in cylindrical and spherical symmetries. We found it timely to present
a global picture of self similar piston problems. In particular, we derive new
results regarding the non trivial transition to accelerating shocks at
sufficiently declining densities (not relevant for collisions).

obtained by using three techniques based on member galaxy kinematics, namely
the caustic method, the method of Dispersion - Kurtosis, and MAMPOSSt. Through
the inversion of the Jeans equation, it was possible to compute the velocity
anisotropy profiles. Results: The mass profiles, as well as the virial values
of mass and radius, computed with the different techniques agree with one
another and with the estimates coming from X-ray and weak lensing studies. A
concordance mass profile is obtained by averaging the lensing, X-ray, and
kinematics determinations. The cluster mass profile is well fitted by an NFW
profile with $c=4.0 \pm 0.5$. The population of red and blue galaxies appear to
have a different velocity anisotropy configuration, since red galaxies are
almost isotropic, while blue galaxies are radially anisotropic, with a weak
dependence on radius. The $Q(r)$ profile for the red galaxy population agrees
with the theoretical results found in cosmological simulations, suggesting that
any bias, relative to the dark matter particles, in velocity dispersion of the
red component is independent of radius. The $\beta - \gamma$ relation for red
galaxies matches the theoretical relation only in the inner region. The
deviations might be due to the use of galaxies as tracers of the gravitational

classify large scale structures within the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA)
survey. Using galaxy groups, we identify 643 filaments across the three
equatorial GAMA fields that span up to 200 $h^{-1}$ Mpc in length, each with an
average of 8 groups within them. By analysing galaxies not belonging to groups
we identify a secondary population of smaller coherent structures composed
entirely of galaxies, dubbed `tendrils' that appear to link filaments together,
or penetrate into voids, generally measuring around 10 $h^{-1}$ Mpc in length
and containing on average 6 galaxies. Finally we are also able to identify a
population of isolated void galaxies. By running this algorithm on GAMA mock
galaxy catalogues we compare the characteristics of large scale structure
between observed and mock data; finding that mock filaments reproduce observed
ones extremely well. This provides a probe of higher order distribution
statistics not captured by the popularly used two-point correlation function.

origin has been ascribed to either satellite accretion events or to disk
instabilities triggered by deviations from axisymmetry. We use a cosmological
simulation of the formation of a disk galaxy to show that counterrotating
stellar disk components may arise naturally in hierarchically-clustering
scenarios even in the absence of merging. The simulated disk galaxy consists of
two coplanar, overlapping stellar components with opposite spins: an inner
counterrotating bar-like structure made up mostly of old stars surrounded by an
extended, rotationally-supported disk of younger stars. The opposite-spin
components originate from material accreted from two distinct filamentary
structures which at turn around, when their net spin is acquired, intersect
delineating a ""V""-like structure. Each filament torques the other in opposite
directions; the filament that first drains into the galaxy forms the inner
counterrotating bar, while material accreted from the other filament forms the
outer disk. Mergers do not play a substantial role and most stars in the galaxy
are formed in situ; only 9% of all stars are contributed by accretion events.
The formation scenario we describe here implies a significant age difference
between the co- and counterrotating components, which may be used to
discriminate between competing scenarios for the origin of counterrotating
stars in disk galaxies.

radio afterglow light curve originates in the external forward shock and that
its peak at a few to tens of days is due to the passage of the minimum
(injection) frequency through the radio band. This allows for the determination
of the peak synchrotron flux of the external forward shock, $f_p$, which is
$f_p \propto \epsilon_B^{1/2}$. The obtained value of $\epsilon_B$ is
conservatively a minimum if the time of the ""jet break"" is unknown, since after
the ""jet break"" $f_p$ is expected to decay with time faster than before it.
Claims of ""jet breaks"" have been made for a subsample of 23 bursts, for which
we can estimate a measurement of $\epsilon_B$. Our results depend on the blast
wave total energy, $E$, and the density of the circum-stellar medium (CSM),
$n$, as $\epsilon_B \propto E^{-2}n^{-1}$. However, by assuming a CSM magnetic
field ($\sim 10$ $\mu$G), we can express the lower limits/measurements on
$\epsilon_B$ as a density-independent ratio, $B/B_{sc}$, of the magnetic field
behind the shock to the CSM shock-compressed magnetic field. We find that the
distribution on both the lower limit on and the measurement of $B/B_{sc}$ spans
$\sim 3.5$ orders of magnitude and both have a median of $B/B_{sc} \sim 30$.
This suggests that some amplification, beyond simple shock-compression, is
necessary to explain these radio afterglow observations.

the two point function of bosonic twist fields on a torus. For the case of the
compact boson, the sum over the classical saddle points results in the
Riemann-Siegel theta function associated with the A_{n-1} lattice. We then
study the Renyi entropies in the decompactification regime. We show that in the

entanglement entropy reduces to the thermal entropy of free bosons on a circle.
We then set up a systematic high temperature expansion of the Renyi entropies

these finite size corrections both for the free boson CFT and the free fermion
CFT with the one-loop corrections obtained from bulk three dimensional
handlebody spacetimes which have higher genus Riemann surfaces as its boundary.
One-loop corrections in these geometries are entirely determined by quantum
numbers of the excitations present in the bulk. This implies that the leading
finite size corrections contributions from one-loop determinants of the
Chern-Simons gauge field and the Dirac field in the dual geometry should
reproduce that of the free boson and the free fermion CFT respectively. By
evaluating these corrections both in the bulk and in the CFT explicitly we show

radiation, cannot be space-like separated and both low-energy within any single

interior region is exponentially smaller than the Schwarzschild size. This
means that their appearances in the low-energy theory are strictly time-like
separated, which nullifies the problem of double entanglement/purity or quantum

The models explore the importance of excitation processes for these lines
including photoionization followed by recombination, radiative excitation by
absorption of continuum radiation and inner shell fluorescence. The models show
that the relative importance of these processes depends on the conditions in
the emitting gas, and that no single emitting component can fit the entire
spectrum. In particular, the relative importance of radiative excitation and
photoionization/recombination differs according to the element and ion stage
emitting the line. This in turn implies a diversity of values for the
ionization parameter of the various components of gas responsible for the
emission, ranging from log(xi)=1 -- 3. Using this, we obtain an estimate for
the total amount of gas responsible for the observed emission. The mass flux
through the region included in the HETG extraction region is approximately 0.3

loose their angular momentum on time scales of ~ 10^8 yr. At lower redshifts
radiation drag becomes inefficient as the Lya photon density in HII regions
decreases by a factor (1+z)^3 and angular momentum is lost on time scales >

exists for the loss of angular momentum by radiation drag for gas clouds at z >

ratios if H2O lines trace warm > 600 K disk gas. These trends suggest that the
inner regions of brown dwarf disks have a lower O/C ratio than those of T Tauri
disks which may result from a more efficient formation of non-migrating icy
planetesimals. A O/C=1, as inferred from our analysis, would have profound
implications on the bulk composition of rocky planets that can form around very
low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.

The method is based on an expansion of the time domain Green's function that

the TDIE system may be effected by descretizing the integral equations in space
and time, forming a matrix system via the Method of Moments, and solving the

used in the description of Bose-Einstein condensates. The condition on such
states to be (approximate) solutions to the quantum equations of motion of GFT
is used to extract an effective dynamics for homogeneous cosmologies directly
from the underlying quantum theory. The resulting description in general gives
nonlinear and nonlocal equations for the 'condensate wavefunction' which are
analogous to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in Bose-Einstein condensates. We
show the general form of the effective equations for current quantum gravity
models, as well as some concrete examples. We identify conditions under which
the dynamics becomes linear, admitting an interpretation as a
quantum-cosmological Wheeler-DeWitt equation, and give its semiclassical (WKB)
approximation in the case of a kinetic term that includes a Laplace-Beltrami
operator. For isotropic states, this approximation reproduces the classical
Friedmann equation in vacuum with positive spatial curvature. We show how the
formalism can be consistently extended from Riemannian signature to Lorentzian
signature models, and discuss the addition of matter fields, obtaining the
correct coupling of a massless scalar in the Friedmann equation from the most
natural extension of the GFT action. We also outline the procedure for
extending our condensate states to include cosmological perturbations. Our
results form the basis of a general programme for extracting effective

large energies. We investigate some models of new physics. We find that a
sudden, order one increase in the cross section above new particle mass
thresholds can be inferred well below the threshold energy. On the other hand,
for two more physical models of particle production, we show that the reach in
energy and the signal strength of the IDR technique is greatly reduced. The
peak sensitivity for the IDR technique is shown to occur when the new particle
masses are near the machine energy, an energy where direct production of new
particles is kinematically disallowed, phase-space suppressed, or if
applicable, suppressed by the soft parton distribution functions. Thus, IDRs do
extend the reach of the LHC, but only to a window around $M_\chi\sim
\sqrt{s_{_{\rm LHC}}}$.

calculate spin-dependent $Q\bar{Q}$ potentials, e.g. the spin-spin potential,
as well. In order to investigate several systematic uncertainties on such
$Q\bar{Q}$ potentials, we carry out lattice QCD simulations using quenched
gauge configurations generated with the single plaquette gauge action with
three different lattice spacings, $a \approx$ 0.093, 0.068 and 0.047 fm, and
two different physical volumes, $L \approx$ 2.2 and 3.0 fm. For heavy quarks,
we employ the relativistic heavy quark (RHQ) action which can control large
discretization errors introduced by large quark mass $m_Q$. The
spin-independent central $Q\bar{Q}$ potential for the charmonium system yields
the ""Coulomb plus linear'' behavior with good scaling and small volume
dependence. We explore the quark mass dependence over the wide mass range from
the charm to beyond the bottom region, and then demonstrate that the
spin-independent central $Q\bar{Q}$ potential in the $m_Q \to \infty$ limit is
fairly consistent with the static $Q\bar{Q}$ potential obtained from Wilson
loops. The spin-spin potential at finite quark mass provides a repulsive
interaction with a finite range, which becomes narrower as the quark mass
increases. We also discuss the applicability of the $1/m_Q$ expansion approach

that the CIBxCXB signal originates from the same unknown source population

explore the subtle generic physics resulting from such coupling we here
introduce `Active Model B'. This is a scalar $\phi^4$ field theory (or

since interfacial phenomena are always strongly implicated in coarsening

literature that addresses these questions assumes complete information: agents
know in advance the value of linking to other agents, even with agents they
have never met and with whom they have had no previous interaction (direct or
indirect). This paper addresses the same questions under what seems to us to be
the much more natural assumption of incomplete information: agents do not know
in advance -- but must learn -- the value of linking to agents they have never
met. We show that the assumption of incomplete information has profound
implications for the process of network formation and the topology of networks
that ultimately form. Under complete information, the networks that form and
are stable typically have a star, wheel or core-periphery form, with high-value
agents in the core. Under incomplete information, the presence of positive
externalities (the value of indirect links) implies that a much wider
collection of network topologies can emerge and be stable. Moreover, even when
the topologies that emerge are the same, the locations of agents can be very
different. For instance, when information is incomplete, it is possible for a
hub-and-spokes network with a low-value agent in the center to form and endure
permanently: an agent can achieve a central position purely as the result of
chance rather than as the result of merit. Perhaps even more strikingly: when
information is incomplete, a connected network could form and persist even if,
when information were complete, no links would ever form, so that the final
form would be a totally disconnected network. All of this can occur even in
settings where agents eventually learn everything so that information, although
initially incomplete, eventually becomes complete.

also show that the main factor for improving the discriminability of homonymous

modeling. In this work, a stability condition is used to close turbulence.
Specifically, we regard single-phase flow as a mixture of turbulent and
non-turbulent fluids, separating the structure of turbulence. Subsequently,
according to the picture of the turbulent eddy cascade, the energy contained in
turbulent flow is decomposed into different parts and then quantified. A
turbulence stability condition, similar to the principle of the
energy-minimization multi-scale (EMMS) model for gas-solid systems, is
formulated to close the dynamic constraint equations of turbulence, allowing
the heterogeneous structural parameters of turbulence to be optimized. We call
this model the `EMMS-based turbulence model', and use it to construct the
corresponding turbulent viscosity coefficient. To validate the EMMS-based
turbulence model, it is used to simulate two classical benchmark problems,
lid-driven cavity flow and turbulent flow with forced convection in an empty
room. The numerical results show that the EMMS-based turbulence model improves
the accuracy of turbulence modeling due to it considers the principle of
compromise in competition between viscosity and inertia.

subtle. We argue that for RG flows preserving the full N=2 SUSY, there are
various obstructions to finding examples with parametrically close UV and IR

known bounds on the c central charge derived from associativity of the operator

argue that if the UV SCFT possesses a single stress tensor, then such RG flows
excite of order all the degrees of freedom of the UV theory. Furthermore, if

use effective-one-body multipolar waveforms calibrated to numerical-relativity
simulations to quantify the effect of neglecting sub-dominant harmonics on the
sensitivity of searches. We consider both signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the
signal-based vetoes that are used to re-weight SNR. We find that neglecting
sub-dominant modes when searching for non-spinning BBHs with component masses
$3\,M_{\odot} \leq m_1, m_2 \leq 200\,M_{\odot}$ and total mass $M <
360\,M_{\odot}$ in advanced LIGO results in a negligible reduction of the
re-weighted SNR at detection thresholds. Sub-dominant modes therefore have no
effect on the detection rates predicted for advanced LIGO. Furthermore, we find
that if sub-dominant modes are included in templates the sensitivity of the
search becomes worse if we use current search priors, due to an increase in
false alarm probability. Templates would need to be weighted differently than
what is currently done to compensate for the increase in false alarms. If we
split the template bank such that sub-dominant modes are only used when $M
\gtrsim 100\,M_{\odot}$ and mass ratio $q \gtrsim 4$, we find that the
sensitivity does improve for these intermediate mass-ratio BBHs, but the
sensitive volume associated with these systems is still small compared to
equal-mass systems. Using sub-dominant modes is therefore unlikely to
substantially increase the probability of detecting gravitational waves from
non-spinning BBH signals unless there is a relatively large population of
intermediate mass-ratio BBHs in the universe.

the same spectral efficiency, multiuser SM-MIMO outperforms conventional
multiuser MIMO (recently being referred to as massive MIMO) by several dBs; for
e.g., with 16 users, 128 antennas at the BS and 4 bpcu per user, SM-MIMO with 4
transmit antennas per user and 4-QAM outperforms massive MIMO with 1 transmit
antenna per user and 16-QAM by about 4 to 5 dB at $10^{-3}$ uncoded BER. The
SNR advantage of SM-MIMO over massive MIMO can be attributed to the following
reasons: (i) because of the spatial index bits, SM-MIMO can use a lower-order
QAM alphabet compared to that in massive MIMO to achieve the same spectral
efficiency, and (ii) for the same spectral efficiency and QAM size, massive
MIMO will need more spatial streams per user which leads to increased spatial
interference.

of supernova remnants (SNR) may provide valuable information on the shock
dynamics and the efficiency of particle acceleration at the shock.
  Aims. We calculated the Balmer line emission and the shape of the broad
Balmer line for parameter values suitable for SNR RCW 86 (G315.4-2.3) as a
function of the cosmic-ray (CR) acceleration efficiency and of the level of
thermal equilibration between electrons and protons behind the shock. This
calculation aims at using the width of the broad Balmer-line emission to infer
the CR acceleration efficiency in this remnant.
  Methods. We used the recently developed nonlinear theory of diffusive
shock-acceleration in the presence of neutrals. The semianalytical approach we
developed includes a description of magnetic field amplification as due to
resonant streaming instability, the dynamical reaction of accelerated particles
and the turbulent magnetic field on the shock, and all channels of interaction
between neutral hydrogen atoms and background ions that are relevant for the
shock dynamics.
  Results. We derive the CR acceleration efficiency in the SNR RCW 86 from the
Balmer emission. Since our calculation used recent measurements of the shock
proper motion, the results depend on the assumed distance to Earth. For a
distance of 2 kpc the measured width of the broad Balmer line is compatible
with the absence of CR acceleration. For a distance of 2.5 kpc, which is a
widely used value in current literature, a CR acceleration efficiency of 5-30%
is obtained, depending upon the electron-ion equilibration and the ionization
fraction upstream of the shock. By combining information on Balmer emission
with the measured value of the downstream electron temperature, we constrain
the CR acceleration efficiency to be ~20%.

is the study of evolutionary covariance from multiple sequence alignments,
especially in light of recent algorithmic improvements and the fast growing
size of sequence databases. In this paper, we present a simple, fast and
accurate algorithm for the prediction of residue-residue contacts based on
regularized least squares. The basic assumption is that spatially proximal
residues in a protein coevolve to maintain the physicochemical complementarity
of the amino acids involved in the contact. Our regularized inversion of the
sample covariance matrix allows the computation of partial correlations between
pairs of residues, thereby removing the effect of spurious transitive
correlations. The method also accounts for low number of observations by means
of a regularization parameter that depends on the effective number of sequences
in the alignment. When tested on a set of protein families from Pfam, we found
the RLS algorithm to have performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods
for contact prediction, while at the same time being faster and conceptually
simpler.

and the overall SED or the shape of the X-ray spectrum. The two classifications
agree in about 70% of the objects, and the remaining 30% can be further
subdivided into two distinct classes: at low luminosities X-ray un-obscured AGN
do not always show signs of broad lines or blue/UV continuum emission in their
optical spectra, most likely due to galaxy dilution effects; at high
luminosities broad line AGN may have absorbed X-ray spectra, which hints at an
increased incidence of small-scale (sub-parsec) dust-free obscuration. We
confirm that the fraction of obscured AGN is a decreasing function of the
intrinsic X-ray luminosity, while the incidence of absorption shows significant
evolution only for the most luminous AGN, which appear to be more commonly
obscured at higher redshift. We find no significant difference between the mean
stellar masses and star formation rates of obscured and un-obscured AGN hosts.
We conclude that the physical state of the medium responsible for obscuration
in AGN is complex, and mainly determined by the radiation environment (nuclear
luminosity) in a small region enclosed within the gravitational sphere of
influence of the central black hole, but is largely insensitive to the wider
scale galactic conditions.

(Non)equivalence of microcanonical and canonical ensembles is investigated by
studying the concavity properties of entropies. The microcanonical entropy
s(e,m) is obtained as a function of the energy e and the magnetization vector m
in the thermodynamic limit. Since, for this model, e is uniquely determined by
m, the same information can be encoded either in s(m) or s(e,m1,m2). Although
these two entropies correspond to the same physical setting of fixed e and m,
their concavity properties differ. The entropy s_h(u), describing the model at
fixed total energy u and in a homogeneous external magnetic field h of
arbitrary direction, is obtained by reduction from the nonconcave entropy
s(e,m1,m2). In doing so, concavity, and therefore equivalence of ensembles, is
restored. s_h(u) has nonanalyticities on surfaces of co-dimension 1 in the
(u,h)-space. Projecting these surfaces into lower-dimensional phase diagrams,
we observe that the resulting phase transition lines are situated in the
positive-temperature region for some parameter values, and in the
negative-temperature region for others. In the canonical setting of a system
coupled to a heat bath of positive temperatures, the nonanalyticities in the
microcanonical negative-temperature region cannot be observed, and this leads
to a situation of effective nonequivalence even when formal equivalence holds.

step-size normalized least mean square (ISSNLMS) algorithm was applied to
adaptive channel estimation (ACE). Since the MIMO channel is often described by
sparse channel model due to broadband signal transmission, such sparsity can be
exploited by adaptive sparse channel estimation (ASCE) methods using sparse
ISS-NLMS algorithms. It is well known that step-size is a critical parameter
which controls three aspects: algorithm stability, estimation performance and
computational cost. The previous approaches can exploit channel sparsity but
their step-sizes are keeping invariant which unable balances well the three
aspects and easily cause either estimation performance loss or instability. In
this paper, we propose two stable sparse variable step-size NLMS (VSS-NLMS)
algorithms to improve the accuracy of MIMO channel estimators. First, ASCE for
estimating MIMO channels is formulated in MIMO systems. Second, different
sparse penalties are introduced to VSS-NLMS algorithm for ASCE. In addition,
difference between sparse ISS-NLMS algorithms and sparse VSS-NLMS ones are
explained. At last, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for
ASCE, several selected simulation results are shown to prove that the proposed

communications. As wireless channels often exhibit sparse structure, the
adaptive sparse channel estimation algorithms based on normalized least mean
square (NLMS) have been proposed, e.g., the zero-attracting NLMS (ZA-NLMS)
algorithm and reweighted zero-attracting NLMS (RZA-NLMS). In these NLMS-based
algorithms, the step size used to iteratively update the channel estimate is a
critical parameter to control the estimation accuracy and the convergence speed
(so the computational cost). However, invariable step-size (ISS) is usually
used in conventional algorithms, which leads to provide performance loss or/and
low convergence speed as well as high computational cost. To solve these
problems, based on the observation that large step size is preferred for fast
convergence while small step size is preferred for accurate estimation, we
propose to replace the ISS by variable step size (VSS) in conventional
NLMS-based algorithms to improve the adaptive sparse channel estimation in
terms of bit error rate (BER) and mean square error (MSE) metrics. The proposed
VSS-ZA-NLMS and VSS-RZA-NLMS algorithms adopt VSS, which can be adaptive to the
estimation error in each iteration, i.e., large step size is used in the case
of large estimation error to accelerate the convergence speed, while small step
size is used when the estimation error is small to improve the steady-state
estimation accuracy. Simulation results are provided to validate the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

correlation functions of peaks with different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are
well described by power laws, and there is a clear cross-correlation between
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III/Constant Mass galaxies and high SNR peaks. The
tangential-shear profiles around peaks increase with peak SNR. We fit
analytical models to the tangential-shear profiles, including a projected
singular isothermal sphere (SIS) model and a projected Navarro, Frenk & White

rejected at ~3-sigma. The NFW model plus a two-halo term gives more acceptable
fits to the data. Some peaks match the positions of optically detected

we find a difference in lensing signal of a factor of 2, suggesting that about

managed in isolation, but rather as families of business process variants. When
modelling such families of variants, analysts are confronted with the choice
between modelling each variant separately, or modelling multiple or all
variants in a single model. Modelling each variant separately leads to a
proliferation of models that share common parts, resulting in redundancies and
inconsistencies. Meanwhile, modelling all variants together leads to less but
more complex models, thus hindering on comprehensibility. This paper introduces
a method for modelling families of process variants that addresses this
trade-off. The key tenet of the method is to alternate between steps of
decomposition (breaking down processes into sub-processes) and deciding which
parts should be modelled together and which ones should be modelled separately.
We have applied the method to two case studies: one concerning the
consolidation of ex-isting process models, and another dealing with green-field
process discovery. In both cases, the method produced fewer models with respect
to the baseline and reduced duplicity by up to 50% without significant impact
on complexity.

there can be other neighboring nodes that can cause/receive interference. The
way to deal with this problem in distributed wireless networks is usage of
MAC-layer mechanisms that make a spatial reservation of the shared wireless
medium, similar to the well-known RTS/CTS in IEEE 802.11 wireless networks. In
this paper, we investigate two-way relaying in presence of interfering nodes
and usage of spatial reservation mechanisms. Specifically, we introduce a
reserved area in order to protect the nodes involved in two-way relaying from
the interference caused by neighboring nodes. We analytically derive the
end-to-end rate achieved by PLNC considering the impact of interference and
reserved area. A relevant performance measure is data rate per unit area, in
order to reflect the fact that any spatial reservation blocks another data
exchange in the reserved area. The numerical results carry a cautionary message
that the gains brought by PLNC over one-way relaying may be vanishing when the
two-way relaying is considered in a broader context of a larger wireless
network.

case the normalization is performed with use of the Wronskian condition applied

already in 1963, Griffith showed that networks of simple threshold elements can
be persistently active at intermediate rates. Here, we extend Griffith's work
and demonstrate that sparse networks of integrate-and-fire neurons assume
stable states of self-sustained asynchronous and irregular firing without
external input or pacemaker neurons. These states can be robustly induced by a
brief pulse to a small fraction of the neurons, or by short a period of
irregular input, and last for several minutes. Self-sustained activity states
emerge when a small fraction of the synapses is strong enough to significantly
influence the firing probability of a neuron, consistent with the recently
proposed long-tailed distribution of synaptic weights. During self-sustained
activity, each neuron exhibits highly irregular firing patterns, similar to
experimentally observed activity. Moreover, the interspike interval
distribution reveals that neurons switch between discrete states of high and
low firing rates. We find that self-sustained activity states can exist even in
small networks of only a thousand neurons. We investigated networks up to 100
000 neurons. Finally, we discuss the implications of self-sustained activity

merger of two neutron stars that triggers an explosion with a burst of
collimated $\gamma$-rays. Following the initial prompt emission, some SGRBs
exhibit a plateau phase in their $X$-ray light curves that indicates additional
energy injection from a central engine, believed to be a rapidly rotating,
highly magnetised neutron star. The collapse of this `protomagnetar' to a black
hole is likely to be responsible for a steep decay in $X$-ray flux observed at
the end of the plateau. In this letter, we show that these observations can be
used to effectively constrain the equation of state of dense matter. In
particular, we show that the known distribution of masses in binary neutron
star systems, together with fits to the $X$-ray light curves, provide
constraints that exclude the softest and stiffest plausible equations of state.
We further illustrate how a future gravitational wave observation with Advanced
LIGO/Virgo can place tight constraints on the equation of state, by adding into
the picture a measurement of the chirp mass of the SGRB progenitor.

appears around compression $V/V_0=0.94$, while a small topology change in the
second sheet is seen at compression $V/V_0=0.90$. This may be in accordance

the difference in behaviour between LaSn$_3$ and YSn$_3$ is the role of
spin-orbit coupling and the hybridization of La - $4f$ states with the Sn - $p$

provide a limited form of data protection when random encoding matrices are

compressed sensing with antipodal random matrices and recent multiclass

real-time transport theory to time-dependent decay problems.Its usefulness is
illustrated for the Anderson model of a quantum dot with tunneling rates
depending on spin due to the ferromagnetic electrodes and/or spin polarization
of the tunnel junction. We set up a second quantization scheme for density
operators in the Liouville-Fock space constructing causal field superoperators
using the fundamental physical principles of causality/probability conservation
and the fermion-parity superselection (univalence). The time-dependent
perturbation series for the time-evolution is renormalized by explicitly
performing the wide-band limit on the superoperator level. The short and
long-time reservoir correlations are shown to be tightly linked to the
occurrence of causal field destruction and creation superoperators,
respectively. The effective theory takes as a reference a damped local system,
providing an interesting starting point for numerical calculations of memory
kernels in real-time. A remarkable feature of this approach is the natural
appearance of a measurable fermion-parity protected decay mode. It already can
be calculated exactly in the Markovian, infinite temperature limit by leading
order perturbation theory, yet persists unaltered for the finite temperature,
interaction and tunneling spin polarization. Furthermore, we show how a
Liouville-space analog of the Pauli principle directly leads to the exact
result in the noninteracting limit: surprisingly, it is obtained in finite
(second) order renormalized perturbation theory, both for the self-energy as
well as the time-evolution propagator. For this limit we calculate the
time-evolution of the full density operator starting from an arbitrary initial
state on the quantum dot, including spin and pairing coherences and
two-particle correlations.

Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithms is confirmed through simulation

Comments are welcome",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The purpose of this paper is to study the realization theory of quantum
linear systems. It is shown that for a general quantum linear system its
controllability and observability are equivalent and they can be checked by
means of a simple matrix rank condition. Based on controllability and
observability a specific realization is proposed for general quantum linear
systems in which an uncontrollable and unobservable subspace is identified.
When restricted to the passive case, it is found that a realization is minimal
if and only if it is Hurwitz stable. Computational methods are proposed to find
the cardinality of minimal realizations of a quantum linear passive system. It
is found that the transfer function of a quantum linear passive system $G$ can
be written as a fractional form in terms of a matrix function $\Sigma$;
moreover, $G$ is lossless bounded real if and only if $\Sigma$ is lossless
positive real. A type of realization for multi-input-multi-output quantum
linear passive systems is derived, which is closely related to its
controllability and observability decomposition. Two realizations, namely the
independent-oscillator realization and the chain-mode realization, are proposed
for single-input-single-output quantum linear passive systems, and it is shown
that under the assumption of minimal realization, the independent-oscillator
realization is unique, and these two realizations are related to the lossless
positive real matrix function $\Sigma$.

produced by changes in the mass accretion rate. The 0.2-10 keV spectra are
extracted in time bins longer than 3 ks to accurately trace the variations of
the best fit parameters of our adopted Comptonisation spectral model. We test a
bulk-motion Comptonisation (BMC) model which is in general applicable to any
physical system powered by accretion onto a compact object, and assumes that
soft seed photons are efficiently up-scattered via inverse Compton scattering
in a hot and dense electron corona. The Comptonised spectrum has a
characteristic power-law shape, whose slope was found to increase for large
values of the normalisation of the seed component, that is proportional to the
mass accretion rate (in Eddington units). Our baseline spectral model also
includes a warm absorber lying on the line of sight and radiation reprocessing
from the accretion disk or from outflowing matter in proximity of the central
compact object. Our study reveals that the normalisation-slope correlation,
observed in Galactic Black Hole sources (GBHs), also holds for Mrk 766:
variations of the photon index in the range Gamma~1.9-2.4 are indeed likely to
be related to the variations of m-dot, as observed in X-ray binary systems. We
finally applied a scaling technique based on the observed correlation to
estimate the BH mass in Mrk 766. This technique is commonly and successfully
applied to measure masses of GBHs, and this is the first time it is applied in
detail to estimate the BH mass in an AGN. We obtain a value of

periodic gravitational waves from neutron stars in binary systems. The orbital
motion of the source in its binary system causes frequency-modulation in the
combination of matched filters known as the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic. The
sideband search is based on the incoherent summation of these
frequency-modulated $\mathcal{F}$-statistic sidebands. It provides a new
detection statistic for sources in binary systems, called the
$\mathcal{C}$-statistic. The search is well suited to low-mass X-ray binaries,
the brightest of which, called Sco X-1, is an ideal target candidate. For
sources like Sco X-1, with well constrained orbital parameters, a slight
variation on the search is possible. The extra orbital information can be used
to approximately demodulate the data from the binary orbital motion in the
coherent stage, before incoherently summing the now reduced number of
sidebands. We investigate this approach and show that it improves the
sensitivity of the standard Sco X-1 directed sideband search. Prior information
on the neutron star inclination and gravitational wave polarization can also be
used to improve upper limit sensitivity. We estimate the sensitivity of a Sco
X-1 directed sideband search on 10 days of LIGO data and show that it can beat
previous upper limits in current LIGO data, with a possibility of constraining
theoretical upper limits using future advanced instruments.

activity in essentially all wavelength bands, exhibits a X-ray activity cycle
in analogy to its photospheric activity cycle of about 17 years and possible
correlations between these bands. We analysed the combined optical photometric
data of AB Dor A, which span ~35 years. Additionally, we used ROSAT and
XMM-Newton X-ray observations of AB Dor A to study the long-term evolution of
magnetic activity in this active K dwarf over nearly three decades and searched
for X-ray activity cycles and related photometric brightness changes. AB Dor A
exhibits photometric brightness variations ranging between 6.75 < Vmag < 7.15

0.3-2.5 keV. As a very active star, AB Dor A shows frequent X-ray flaring, but,
in the long XMM-Newton observations a kind of basal state is attained very
often. This basal state probably varies with the photospheric activity-cycle of
AB Dor A which has a period of ~17 years, but, the X-ray variability amounts at
most to a factor of ~2, which is, much lower than the typical cycle amplitudes

by numerical simulations of lattice-regularised QCD. Within errors, the PDAs of
pseudoscalar and vector mesons constituted from the same valence quarks are
identical; they are concave functions, whose dilation expresses the strength of
dynamical chiral symmetry breaking; and SU(3)-flavour symmetry is broken
nonperturbatively at the level of 10%. Notably, the appearance of precision in
the lattice moments is misleading. The moments also exhibit material dependence
on lattice volume, especially for the pion. Improvements need therefore be made
before an accurate, unified picture of the light-front structure of light-quark
pseudoscalar and vector mesons is revealed.

increasingly calls for appropriate methodologies to account for the biases that
invariably accompany samples formed by such data. It is well-known, for
example, that subjects with shorter lifetime are less likely to be present in
such studies. Moreover, certain covariate values could be preferentially
selected into the sample, being linked to the long-term survivors. The existing
methodology for estimation of the propensity score using data collected on
prevalent cases requires the correct conditional survival/hazard function given
the treatment and covariates. This requirement can be alleviated if the disease
under study has stationary incidence, the so-called stationarity assumption. We
propose a nonparametric adjustment technique based on a weighted estimating
equation for estimating the propensity score which does not require modeling
the conditional survival/hazard function when the stationarity assumption
holds. Large sample properties of the estimator is established and its small
sample behavior is studied via simulation.

  This manuscript was originally submitted to PNAS on June 5, 2013",,,,"q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The measurement of information flows within moving animal groups has recently
been a topic of considerable interest, and it has become clear that the
individual(s) that drive collective movement may change over time, and that
such individuals may not necessarily always lead from the front. However,
methods to quantify the influence of specific individuals on the behaviour of
other group members and the direction of information flow in moving group, are
lacking on the level of empirical studies and theoretical models. Using high
spatio-temporal resolution GPS trajectories of foraging meerkats, Suricata
suricatta, we provide an information-theoretic framework to identify dynamical
coupling between animals independent of their relative spatial positions. Based
on this identification, we then compare designations of individuals as either
drivers or responders against designations provided by the relative spatial
position. We find that not only does coupling occur both from the frontal to
the trailing individuals and vice versa, but also that the coupling direction
is a non-linear function of the relative position. This provides evidence for
(i) intermittent fluctuation of the coupling strength and (ii) alternation in
the coupling direction within foraging meerkat pairs. The framework we
introduce allows for a detailed description of the dynamical patterns of mutual
influence between all pairs of individuals within moving animal groups. We
argue that applying an information-theoretic perspective to the study of
coordinated phenomena in animal groups will eventually help to understand cause
and effect in collective behaviour.

So, a low-complexity compressive sensing video encoder framework with
application-aware configurable mechanism is proposed in this paper, where novel
encoding methods are exploited based on the practical purposes of the real
applications to reduce the coding complexity effectively and improve the
compression ratio (CR). Moreover, the group of processing (GOP) size and the
measurement matrix size can be configured on the encoder side according to the
post-analysis requirements of an application example of object tracking to
increase the CR of encoder as best as possible. Simulations show the proposed

tackling two important components: efficient sampling in vast conformation
space, and design of knowledge-based potentials with high accuracy. We have
proposed the first-order and second-order CRF-Sampler to sample structures from
the continuous local dihedral angles space by modeling the lower and higher
order conditional dependency between neighboring dihedral angles given the
primary sequence information. A framework combining the Conditional Random
Fields and the energy function is introduced to guide the local conformation
sampling using long range constraints with the energy function.
  The relationship between the sequence profile and the local dihedral angle
distribution is nonlinear. Hence we proposed the CNF-Folder to model this
complex relationship by applying a novel machine learning model Conditional
Neural Fields which utilizes the structural graphical model with the neural
network. CRF-Samplers and CNF-Folder perform very well in CASP8 and CASP9.
  Further, a novel pairwise distance statistical potential (EPAD) is designed
to capture the dependency of the energy profile on the positions of the
interacting amino acids as well as the types of those amino acids, opposing the
common assumption that this energy profile depends only on the types of amino
acids. EPAD has also been successfully applied in the CASP 10 Free Modeling
experiment with CNF-Folder, especially outstanding on some uncommon structured
targets.

digital circuits is able to correctly capture glitch propagation. Prominent
examples of such models are based on pure delay channels (P), inertial delay
channels (I), or the elaborate PID channels proposed by Bellido-D\'iaz et al.
We accomplish our goal by considering the solvability/non-solvability border of
a simple problem called Short-Pulse Filtration (SPF), which is closely related
to arbitration and synchronization. On one hand, we prove that SPF is solvable
in bounded time in any such model that provides channels with non-constant
delay, like I and PID. This is in opposition to the impossibility of solving
bounded SPF in real (physical) circuit models. On the other hand, for binary
circuit models with constant-delay channels, we prove that SPF cannot be solved
even in unbounded time; again in opposition to physical circuit models.
Consequently, indeed none of the binary value-domain models proposed so far
(and that we are aware of) faithfully captures glitch propagation of real
circuits. We finally show that these modeling mismatches do not hold for the
weaker eventual SPF problem.

of the numbers of journals and academic articles published, increases in the

of countries participating; important parts of the academic activity are
becoming more nationalistic. In addition, international collaboration is
decreasing in several subject areas, and in several geographic regions. For
example, countries in Asia are becoming scientifically more isolated; and
academics working in the humanities in all the regions of the world are very
nationalistic and are becoming more so. The precise consequences of this
dynamics are difficult to predict, but it certainly will have reverberations
beyond academia. The tendency of the humanities to become more provincial will
certainly not help in reducing international conflicts arising from poor

elements of the dipole transitions and when they are blocked one can expect
occurring a number of interesting phenomena in radiation-collisional kinetics.
In recent astrophysical studies of IR emission spectra it was revealed a gap in
the radiation emitted by Rydberg atoms ($RA$) with values of the principal
quantum number of $n\approx10$. Under the presence of external electric fields
a rearrangement of $RA$ emission spectra is possible to associate with
manifestations of the Stark effect. The threshold for electric field ionization
of $RA$ is $E\approx3\cdot10^{4}$ V/cm for states with $n>10$. This means that
the emission of $RA$ with $n\ge10$ is effectively blocked for such fields. In
the region of lower electric field intensities the double Stark resonance (or
F\""{o}rster resonance) becomes a key player. On this basis it is established
the fact that the static magnetic or electric fields may strongly affect the
radiative constants of optical transitions in the vicinity of the F\""{o}ster
resonance resulting, for instance, in an order of magnitude reduction of the
intensity in some lines. Then, it is shown in this work that in the atmospheres
of celestial objects lifetimes of comparatively long-lived $RA$ states and
intensities of corresponding radiative transitions can be associated with the
effects of dynamic chaos via collisional ionization. The F\""{o}ster resonance
allows us to manipulate the random walk of the Rydberg electron ($RE$) in the
manifold of quantum levels and hence change the excitation energies of $RA$,
which lead to anomalies in the IR spectra.

means of electrical resistivity, magnetization, ab-initio band structure
calculations, and nuclear spin-lattice relaxation $1/T_1$ of the $^{69,71}$Ga
nuclei. Temperature dependencies of the electrical resistivity reveal that the
evolution from the semiconducting to the metallic state in the
Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$Ga$_3$ system occurs at $0.025<x<0.075$. The $^{69,71}(1/T_1)$
was studied as a function of temperature in a wide temperature range of
$2\!-\!300$ K for the concentrations $x = 0.0,$ $0.5,$ and $1.0$. In the parent
semiconducting compound FeGa$_3$, the temperature dependence of the
$^{69}(1/T_1)$ exhibits a huge maximum at about $T\!\sim\!6$ K indicating the
existence of in-gap states. The opposite binary compound, CoGa$_3$,
demonstrates a metallic Korringa behavior with $1/T_1$ $\propto T$. In
Fe$_{0.5}$Co$_{0.5}$Ga$_3$, the relaxation is strongly enhanced due to spin
fluctuations and follows $1/T_1\propto T^{1/2}$, which is a unique feature of
weakly and nearly antiferromagnetic metals. This itinerant antiferromagnetic
behavior contrasts with both magnetization measurements, showing localized
magnetism with a relatively low effective moment of about 0.7 $\mu_B$/f.u., and
ab initio band structure calculations, where a ferromagnetic state with an
ordered moment of 0.5 $\mu_B$/f.u. is predicted. The results are discussed in

gasket is intensively studied, and a number of exotic properties are disclosed.
The ground state phase diagram in the plane of magnetic field-interaction of
the system is obtained. The thermodynamic properties of the three plateau
phases are probed by exploring the temperature-dependence of magnetization,
specific heat, susceptibility and spin-spin correlations. No phase transitions
are observed in this model. In the absence of a magnetic field, the unusual
temperature dependence of the spin correlation length is obtained with $0
\leq$J$_b/$J$_a<1$, and an interesting crossover behavior between different
phases at J$_b/$J$_a=1$ is unveiled, whose dynamics can be described by the
J$_b/$J$_a$-dependence of the specific heat, susceptibility and spin
correlation functions. The exotic spin-spin correlation patterns that share the
same special rotational symmetry as that of the Sierpi\'{n}ski gasket are
obtained in both the $1/3$ plateau disordered phase and the $5/9$ plateau
partially ordered ferrimagnetic phase. Moreover, a quantum scheme is formulated
to study the thermodynamics of the fractal Sierpi\'{n}ski gasket with
Heisenberg interactions. We find that the unusual temperature dependence of the
correlation length remains intact in a small quantum fluctuation.

more than forty years now, nematoacoustics still poses intriguing theoretical
and experimental problems. In this paper, we prove that the main observed
features of acoustic wave propagation through a nematic liquid crystal cell --
namely, the anisotropy of sound velocity and its frequency dependence -- may be
plausibly explained by a first-gradient continuum theory characterized by a
hyperelastic anisotropic response from an evolving relaxed configuration. We
compare and contrast our proposal with a competing theory where the liquid
crystal is modeled as an isotropically compressible, anisotropic
second-gradient fluid.

  the Development of the Fundamental Concept of Mass","59 pages",,,,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  In this paper we pose two fundamental ideas on the motion of an elementary
particle supporting the internal ""spin motion"" or $\textit{Zitterbewegung}$ and
a particle as concentrated energy. First, the particle moves randomly in a
limited area (in a quantum sized-volume) like random vibrating system where the
particle will diffuse in a quantum-sized volume when it absorbs or emits the
quantized amount of energy. The quantum sized-volume can move too and plays
role similar to the carrier amplitude, while the vibrational motion of the
fundamental particle with frequency and amplitude represents a modulating
signal. The current of diffusion process taking place in the quantum
sized-volume will represent the emergence of a spin phenomenon shown by the
existence of Clifford algebra. Second, the particle is pure energy concentrated
on the surface of 3 dimensional sphere-form (2-manifold without boundary).
Afterward we show that by defining the particle mass as an invariant quantity
based on the two fundamental ideas, we can derive both the diffusion constant
of the particle in the quantum sized-volume as $\beta = \hslash/2m$ and the
Schr\""{o}dinger equation. Furthermore, by posing that the vibrational motion of
the particle limited on the quantum sized-volume plays fundamental role as time
interval unit (proper time or particle clock), we show that the relativistic
effects of the particle must represent atomic processes.

one of the main research lines in robotics. In typical real-world scenarios,
humans are at some distance from the robot and the acquired signals are
strongly impaired by noise, reverberations and other interfering sources. In
this context, the detection and localisation of speakers plays a key role since
it is the pillar on which several tasks (e.g.: speech recognition and speaker
tracking) rely. We address the problem of how to detect and localize people
that are both seen and heard by a humanoid robot. We introduce a hybrid
deterministic/probabilistic model. Indeed, the deterministic component allows
us to map the visual information into the auditory space. By means of the
probabilistic component, the visual features guide the grouping of the auditory
features in order to form AV objects. The proposed model and the associated
algorithm are implemented in real-time (17 FPS) using a stereoscopic camera
pair and two microphones embedded into the head of the humanoid robot NAO. We
performed experiments on (i) synthetic data, (ii) a publicly available data set
and (iii) data acquired using the robot. The results we obtained validate the
approach and encourage us to further investigate how vision can help robot
hearing.

""effective constitutive relations"" for problems in dynamics. This is done in
the context of longitudinal shear waves in an elastic medium that is
periodically laminated, with attention restricted to plane waves propagating in
the direction normal to the interfaces. The properties of such waves can be
found by employing Floquet theory, implemented via a ""transfer matrix""
formulation. Problems occur at frequencies beyond those that define the first
pass band, associated in part with the difficulty of assigning a unique
wavenumber to the wave. This problem is examined, paying careful attention to
the requirements of causality and passivity. The transmission of waves into a
half-space is discussed by studying the impedance of the half-space, both
directly and in the ""effective medium"" approximation, and an alternative way of
looking at this problem, based on construction of the Green's function, is
developed.

  Reinforcement Learning Approach",,,,,"cs.MM cs.IR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Current music recommender systems typically act in a greedy fashion by
recommending songs with the highest user ratings. Greedy recommendation,
however, is suboptimal over the long term: it does not actively gather
information on user preferences and fails to recommend novel songs that are
potentially interesting. A successful recommender system must balance the needs
to explore user preferences and to exploit this information for recommendation.
This paper presents a new approach to music recommendation by formulating this
exploration-exploitation trade-off as a reinforcement learning task called the
multi-armed bandit. To learn user preferences, it uses a Bayesian model, which
accounts for both audio content and the novelty of recommendations. A
piecewise-linear approximation to the model and a variational inference
algorithm are employed to speed up Bayesian inference. One additional benefit
of our approach is a single unified model for both music recommendation and
playlist generation. Both simulation results and a user study indicate strong
potential for the new approach.

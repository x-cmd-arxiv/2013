still an open question. We find that mini halos (such as in Perseus and
Ophiuchus) can be explained by radio-emitting electrons that are generated in
hadronic cosmic ray (CR) interactions with protons of the intracluster medium.
By contrast, the hadronic model either fails to explain the extended emission
of giant radio halos (as in Coma at low frequencies) or would require a flat CR
profile, which can be realized through outward streaming and diffusion of CRs
(in Coma and A2163 at 1.4 GHz). We suggest that a second, leptonic component
could be responsible for the missing flux in the outer parts of giant halos
within a new hybrid scenario and we describe its possible observational
consequences. To study the hadronic emission component of the radio halo
population statistically, we use a cosmological mock galaxy cluster catalog
built from the MultiDark simulation. Because of the properties of CR streaming
and the different scalings of the X-ray luminosity (L_X) and the
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich flux (Y) with gas density, our model can simultaneously
reproduce the observed bimodality of radio-loud and radio-quiet clusters at the
same L_X as well as the unimodal distribution of radio-halo luminosity versus
Y; thereby suggesting a physical solution to this apparent contradiction. We
predict radio halo emission down to the mass scale of galaxy groups, which
highlights the unique prospects for low-frequency radio surveys (such as the
LOFAR Tier 1 survey) to increase the number of detected radio halos by at least
an order of magnitude.

affect hole motion and doping a hole consequently does not lift the
subextensive degeneracy of the nematic phase. In order to broaden and deepen

both the nematic and the antiferromagnetic phases, also in the presence of
quantum fluctuations away from pure Ising exchange. In addition to quantum
fluctuations and interorbital hopping, three-site hopping is found to play an
important role and to dominate propagation in the two-dimensional Ising limit

applications in recent years, including photography, shortwave infrared
cameras, optical system research, facial recognition, MRI, etc. In wireless
sensor networks (WSNs), significant research work has been pursued to
investigate the use of CS to reduce the amount of data communicated,
particularly in data aggregation applications and thereby improving energy
efficiency. However, most of the previous work in WSN has used CS under the
assumption that data field is smooth with negligible white Gaussian noise. In
these schemes signal sparsity is estimated globally based on the entire data
field, which is then used to determine the CS parameters. In more realistic
scenarios, where data field may have regional fluctuations or it is piecewise
smooth, existing CS based data aggregation schemes yield poor compression
efficiency. In order to take full advantage of CS in WSNs, we propose an
Adaptive Hierarchical Data Aggregation using Compressive Sensing (A-HDACS)
scheme. The proposed schemes dynamically chooses sparsity values based on
signal variations in local regions. We prove that A-HDACS enables more sensor
nodes to employ CS compared to the schemes that do not adapt to the changing
field. The simulation results also demonstrate the improvement in energy
efficiency as well as accurate signal recovery.

Techniques of equivariant bifurcation theory allow one to identify the type of
possible symmetry-breaking Hopf bifurcation, as well as to classify different
periodic solutions in terms of their spatial and temporal symmetries. The
approach is also illustrated on other models of multi-strain diseases, where
the same methodology provides a systematic understanding of bifurcation
scenarios and periodic behaviours. The results of the analysis are quite
generic, and have wider implications for understanding the dynamics of a large
class of models of multi-strain diseases.

mechanisms that drive the evolution of planetary systems.
  Aims. Tidal dissipation properties are intrisically linked to the internal
structure and the rheology of studied celestial bodies. The resulting
dependence of the dissipation upon the tidal frequency is strongly different in
the cases of solids and fluids.
  Methods. We compute the tidal evolution of a two-body coplanar system, using
the tidal quality factor's frequency-dependencies appropriate to rocks and to
convective fluids.
  Results. The ensuing orbital dynamics comes out smooth or strongly erratic,
dependent on how the tidal dissipation depends upon frequency.
  Conclusions. We demonstrate the strong impact of the internal structure and
of the rheology of the central body on the orbital evolution of the tidal
perturber. A smooth frequency-dependence of the tidal dissipation renders a
smooth orbital evolution while a peaked dissipation can furnish erratic orbital
behaviour.

argued by several authors. The two-state statistical model adopted by numerous

the description of charged membranes, since it lacks a proper description of

with water molecules to lipid-lipid interactions and obtain its thermal
properties under a mean-field approach. Density variations, although
concomitant with chain order variations, are independent of the latter. The

Angle resolved photoemission reveals coherent excitation only near nodal points
on parts of the ""bare"" Fermi surface known as the Fermi arcs. The question
debated in the literature is whether the small normal pocket, seen via quantum
oscillations exists at higher temperatures or forms below a charge order
transition in strong magnetic fields. Assuming the former case as possibility,
expressions derived for the resistivity and the Hall coefficient (in weak and
strong magnetic fields) with both types of carriers participating in transport.
There are two regimes. At higher temperatures (at a fixed field) electrons are
dragged by the Fermi arcs' holes. The pocket being small its contribution into
conductivity and the Hall coefficient is negligible. At lower temperatures
electrons decouple from holes behaving as a Fermi gas in the magnetic field.
Mobility of holes on the arcs decreasing in strong fields with decrease of
temperature, below a crossover point the pocket electrons prevail changing sign
of the Hall coefficient in the low temperature limit. Such behavior finds its
confirmation in recent high-field experiments.

formula consistent with the assignment exhibits a large algorithmic gap: while
the planted solution becomes unique and can be identified given a formula with
$O(n\log n)$ clauses, there are distributions over clauses for which the best
known efficient algorithms require $n^{k/2}$ clauses. We propose and study a
unified model for planted $k$-SAT, which captures well-known special cases. An
instance is described by a planted assignment $\sigma$ and a distribution on
clauses with $k$ literals. We define its distribution complexity as the largest
$r$ for which the distribution is not $r$-wise independent ($1 \le r \le k$ for
any distribution with a planted assignment).
  Our main result is an unconditional lower bound, tight up to logarithmic
factors, for statistical (query) algorithms [Kearns 1998, Feldman et. al 2012],
matching known upper bounds, which, as we show, can be implemented using a
statistical algorithm. Since known approaches for problems over distributions
have statistical analogues (spectral, MCMC, gradient-based, convex optimization
etc.), this lower bound provides a rigorous explanation of the observed
algorithmic gap. The proof introduces a new general technique for the analysis
of statistical query algorithms. It also points to a geometric paring
phenomenon in the space of all planted assignments.
  We describe consequences of our lower bounds to Feige's refutation hypothesis
[Feige 2002] and to lower bounds on general convex programs that solve planted
$k$-SAT. Our bounds also extend to other planted $k$-CSP models, and, in
particular, provide concrete evidence for the security of Goldreich's one-way
function and the associated pseudorandom generator when used with a
sufficiently hard predicate [Goldreich 2000].

stage structure---larvae, juveniles, and adults---and dispersion. Specifically,
we address the issue of whether or not dispersion can amplify the net

matrix population models with dispersion, particularly those with an Usher
demography matrix. Techniques for computing the net reproductive number, like
the graph reduction method of de-Camino-Beck and Lewis, will be discussed. A
common theme will be the usefulness of submatrices of relevant matrices
obtained by the expunging of rows and columns corresponding to non-newborns.
Finally, examples will be provided, including the calculation of the net
reproductive number for multiple regions using the graph reduction method of
de-Camino-Beck and Lewis, examples where dispersion results in a total
population flourishing when the populations would otherwise go extinct, and an
application to the invasive round goby fish.

macromolecular building blocks is a critical open question in both biological
systems and nanoscience. Using molecular dynamics simulations we study the
self-assembly of tubular structures from model macromolecular monomers with
multiple binding sites on their surfaces [Cheng et al., Soft Matter 8,
5666-5678 (2012)]. In this work we add chirality to the model monomer and a
lock-and-key interaction. The self-assembly of free monomers into tubules
yields a pitch value that often does not match the chirality of the monomer
(including achiral monomers). We show that this mismatch occurs because of a
twist deformation that brings the lateral interaction sites into alignment when
the tubule pitch differs from the monomer chirality. The energy cost for this
deformation is small as the energy distributions substantially overlap for
small differences in the pitch and chirality. In order to control the tubule
pitch by preventing the twist deformation, the interaction between the vertical
surfaces must be increased without resulting in kinetically trapped structures.
For this purpose, we employ the lock-and-key interactions and obtain good
control of the self-assembled tubule pitch. These results explain some
fundamental features of microtubules. The vertical interaction strength is
larger than the lateral in microtubules because this yields a controlled
assembly of tubules with the proper pitch. We also generally find that the
control of the assembly into tubules is difficult, which explains the wide
range of pitch and protofilament number observed in microtubule assembly.

belief, it is very difficult to write compact formulas expressing the
blockspinning of lattice models. We show that in contrast to other approaches,
the TRG formulation allows us to write exact blocking formulas with numerically
controllable truncations. The basic reason is that the TRG blocking separates
neatly the degrees of freedom inside the block and which are integrated over,
from those kept to communicate with the neighboring blocks. We argue that the
TRG is a method that can handle large volumes, which is crucial to approach
quasi-conformal systems. The method can also get rid of some sign problems. We
discuss recent results regarding the critical properties of the 2D O(2)
nonlinear sigma model with complex beta and chemical potential. As some of

radiation. In the case of an ideal single-photon detector, the contribution of
photon noise to the statistics of the registered signal has been thoroughly
examined. However, practical photon counters have a dead time, leading to
miscounting of certain true events, and sometimes the counters generate false
after-pulses.
  This study investigate the impact of these two effects, and it presents the
theoretical relations between the statistical moments of the radiation and the
registered counts while also accounting for dead time and the probability of
after-pulses. Expressions for statistical moments of any order are obtained on
the basis of the generalized Poisson distribution (GPD). For counters with
paralyzable dead time, alternative relations for the mean and variance are
derived using generally accepted formulas.
  As an example, the measurements of stellar scintillation and the result of
simple experiment are considered. The results of the experimental verification
of the theoretical expression confirm the need to account for the non-ideal
nature of detectors in almost all similar measurements.

super-earth GJ 667Cc in the multiple system of at least two exoplanets orbiting
a nearby M dwarf, paying special attention to its spin-orbital state. The
published radial velocities for this star are re-analyzed and evidence is found
for additional periodic signals, which could be taken for two additional
planets on eccentric orbits. Such systems are not dynamically viable and break
up quickly in numerical integrations. Limiting the scope to the two originally
detected planets, we assess the dynamical stability of the system and find no
evidence for bounded chaos in the orbital motion. The orbital eccentricity of
the planets b and c is found to change cyclicly in the range 0.06 - 0.28 and
0.05 - 0.25, respectively, with a period of approximately 0.46 yr. Taking the
eccentricity variation into account, numerical integrations are performed of
the differential equations modeling the spin-orbit interaction of the planet GJ
667Cc with its host star assuming a terrestrial composition of its mantle.
Depending on the interior temperature of the planet, it is likely to be
entrapped in the 3:2 (probability 0.51) or even higher spin-orbit resonance. It
is less likely to reach the 1:1 resonance (probability 0.24). The estimated
characteristic spin-down times are quite short for the two planets, i.e.,
within 1 Myr for planet c and even shorter for planet b. Both planet arrived at
their current and, most likely, ultimate spin-orbit states a long time ago. The
rate of tidal dissipation of energy is formidably high in the planets of GJ
667, estimated at $10^{23.7}$ and $10^{26.7}$ J yr$^{-1}$ for c and b,
respectively. This raises a question of how such relatively massive, close

computational complexity of approximating the partition function on graphs of

uniqueness phase transition on the infinite D-regular tree. For the
ferromagnetic Potts model we investigate whether analogous hardness results
hold. Goldberg and Jerrum showed that approximating the partition function of
the ferromagnetic Potts model is at least as hard as approximating the number
of independent sets in bipartite graphs (#BIS-hardness). We improve this
hardness result by establishing it for bipartite graphs of maximum degree D. We
first present a detailed picture for the phase diagram for the infinite
D-regular tree, giving a refined picture of its first-order phase transition
and establishing the critical temperature for the coexistence of the disordered
and ordered phases. We then prove for all temperatures below this critical
temperature that it is #BIS-hard to approximate the partition function on
bipartite graphs of maximum degree D. As a corollary, it is #BIS-hard to
approximate the number of k-colorings on bipartite graphs of maximum degree D
when k <= D/(2 ln D).
  The #BIS-hardness result for the ferromagnetic Potts model uses random
bipartite regular graphs as a gadget in the reduction. The analysis of these
random graphs relies on recent connections between the maxima of the
expectation of their partition function, attractive fixpoints of the associated
tree recursions, and induced matrix norms. We extend these connections to
random regular graphs for all ferromagnetic models and establish the Bethe
prediction for every ferromagnetic spin system on random regular graphs. We
also prove for the ferromagnetic Potts model that the Swendsen-Wang algorithm
is torpidly mixing on random D-regular graphs at the critical temperature for

each hadron receives an individual kick from the electric field of the
amplified electron density perturbation created in the modulator by this hadron
in a co-propagating electron beam. We developed a method for computing the
dynamics of these density perturbations in an infinite electron plasma with any
equilibrium velocity distribution -- a possible model for the modulator. We
derived analytical expressions for the dynamics of the density perturbations in
the Fourier-Laplace domain for a variety of 1D, 2D, and 3D equilibrium
distributions of the electron beam. To obtain the space-time dynamics, we
employed the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm. We also found an
analytical solution in the space-time domain for the 1D Cauchy equilibrium
distribution, which serves as a benchmark for our general approach based on
numerical evaluation of the integral transforms and as a fast alternative to
the numerical computations. We tested the method for various distributions and
initial conditions.

which has a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry that prevents even/odd coupling. The theory
is assumed to have no two-particle bound states and to have two-particle phase
shifts that are bounded by $\pi/2$ in the regime of elastic scattering.
Considering center of mass energies between one and five particle masses, we
evaluate a three-to-three finite-volume correlator to all orders in
perturbation theory. Only terms which are exponentially suppressed in volume
are neglected. From poles in the correlator we then determine the relation
between finite-volume spectrum and scattering quantities. In this analysis one
must carefully treat the unitary cusp at two-particle threshold. This point,
which was neglected in the conference talks, is described in some detail here.
We also describe an important check on our main result by reproducing the large
volume expansion of the energy shift from the three-particle threshold. This is
found to be consistent with previous work through four non-trivial orders.

The sequences in $I^\ZZ$ are organized into connected regions which always
start with a symbol in $\aS$. The regions are labelled by types $C(s)$, thus a
region starting at $s'\in C(s)$ has the same type as one starting at $s$. Let
$(\aP_s: s\in \aS)$ be a family of distributions on $I^\NN$ where each $\aP_s$
charges sequences starting with the symbol $s$. We can define a natural
distribution $\PP$ on $I^\NN$, that counts the number of visits to the states
from $\aP_s$, properly weighted. A dynamics of interest is such that at the
first occurrence of $s'\in \aS\setminus C(s)$ the law regenerates with
distribution $\aP_{s'}$. In this case we are able to find simple conditions for
$\PP$ to be stationary. In addition, we study the following more complex model:
once a symbol $s'\in \aS\setminus C(s)$ has been encountered, there is a
decision to be made, either a new region of type $C(s')$ governed by $\aP_{s'}$
starts or the region continues to be a $C(s)$ region. This decision is modeled
as random and depends on $s'$. In this setting a similar distribution to $\PP$
can be constructed and the conditions for stationarity are supplied. These
models are inspired by genomic sequences where $I$ is the set of codons, the
classes $(C(s): s\in \aS)$ group codons defining similar genomic classes, e.g.
in bacteria there are two classes corresponding to the start and stop codons,
and the random decision to continue a region or to begin a new region of a
different class reflects the well-known fact that not every appearance of a
start codon marks the beginning of a new coding region.

the non-uniform extracellular field. We analyzed the characteristics of the

that evolve according to the usual principles of selection and mutation.
Quasispecies studies have invariably concentrated on the possibility of errors
during genotype replication and their role in promoting either the survival or
the demise of the quasispecies. In a previous work [V. C. Barbosa, R.
Donangelo, and S. R. Souza, J. Theor. Biol. 312, 114 (2012)], we introduced a
network model of quasispecies dynamics, based on a single probability parameter
($p$) and capable of addressing several plausibility issues of previous models.
Here we extend that model by pairing its network with another one aimed at
modeling the dynamics of the immune system when confronted with the
quasispecies. The new network is based on the idiotypic-network model of
immunity and, together with the previous one, constitutes a network model of
interacting genotypes and idiotypes. The resulting model requires further
parameters and as a consequence leads to a vast phase space. We have focused on
a particular niche in which it is possible to observe the trade-offs involved
in the quasispecies' survival or destruction. Within this niche, we give
simulation results that highlight some key preconditions for quasispecies
survival. These include a minimum initial abundance of genotypes relative to
that of the idiotypes and a minimum value of $p$. The latter, in particular, is
to be contrasted with the stand-alone quasispecies network of our previous
work, in which arbitrarily low values of $p$ constitute a guarantee of
quasispecies survival.

  In this paper, we give general inductive construction schemes and proof
techniques to generate {\em nucleation-free graphs} (i.e., graphs without any

additionally follows that true rigidity is strictly stronger than a tractable

contained in some region of the cover, and each region of the cover is either
(1) $\phi(T_i)$ for some $i$, or (2) $\phi(A \cup B)$, where $A$ and $B$ are
constructed by either (1) or (2), and $A \cap B \neq \emptyset$.
  We present two properties for the function $\phi$ that make the $\phi$-cover
well-defined. Examples for such functions $\phi$ are the convex hull and the
axis-aligned bounding box. For both of these functions $\phi$, we show that the
$\phi$-cover can be computed in $O(n\log^2n)$ time, where $n$ is the total
number of vertices of the trees in $T$.

communication in multiplicative matrix channels over finite chain rings. Such
channels are defined by the law $Y =A X$, where $X$ and $Y$ are the input and
output matrices, respectively, and $A$ is called the transfer matrix. It is
assumed a coherent scenario in which the instances of the transfer matrix are
unknown to the transmitter, but available to the receiver. It is also assumed
that $A$ and $X$ are independent. Besides that, no restrictions on the
statistics of $A$ are imposed. As contributions, a closed-form expression for
the channel capacity is obtained, and a coding scheme for the channel is
proposed. It is then shown that the scheme can achieve the capacity with
polynomial time complexity and can provide correcting guarantees under a
worst-case channel model. The results in the paper extend the corresponding
ones for finite fields.

holes (BHs) in X$-$ray binaries (XBs) have been predicted and confirmed (three
cases) by observations. The rotational energy of these BHs is sufficient to
power up long gamma$-$ray bursts and hypernovae (GRBs/HNe) and still leave a
Kerr BH behind. However, strong magnetic fields and/or dynamo effects in the
interior of such stars deplete their cores from angular momentum preventing the
formation of collapsars. Thus, even though binaries can produce Kerr BHs, most
of their rotation is acquired from the stellar mantle, with a long delay
between BH formation and spin up. Such binaries would not form GRBs. We study
whether the conditions required to produce GRBs can be met by the progenitors
of such BHs. Tidal-synchronization and Alfv\'en timescales are compared for
magnetic fields of different intensities threading He stars. A search is made
for a magnetic field range which allows tidal spin up all the way in to the
stellar core but prevents its slow down during differential rotation phases.
The energetics for producing a strong magnetic field during core collapse,
which may allow for a GRB central engine, are also estimated. An
observationally-reasonable choice of parameters is found ($B \lesssim10^2$ G
threading a slowly-rotating He star) which allows Fe cores to retain
substantial angular momentum. Thus, the Case-C-mass-transfer binary channel is
capable of explaining long GRBs. However, the progenitors must have low initial
spin and low internal magnetic field throughout their H-burning and He-burning
phases.

X-ray bolometric luminosity and temperature in galaxy clusters at high

find a slope fully consistent with the one typical of local clusters, albeit
with a large associated uncertainty. The study on the evolution of the
amplitude reveals a positive offset if the self-similar evolution is neglected,
hence possibly indicating the need for including evolutionary effects. However,
the $L_X - T_X$ relation is found to be in good agreement with the local
relation without any significant redshift evolution. Finally, the $\sigma_v -
T_X$ relation appears to slightly deviate from the theoretical expectation that
galaxies and gas particles have a similar specific kinetic energy. However, the
associated uncertainty is currently too large for making any conclusive
statement in this regard.

a very low observed fraction of scattered soft X-rays, f_scat < 0.5%. Based on
X-ray modeling these ""X-ray new-type"", or low observed X-ray scattering
(hereafter:""low-scattering"") sources have been interpreted as deeply-buried AGN
with a high covering factor of gas. In this paper we address the questions
whether the host galaxies of low-scattering AGN may contribute to the observed
X-ray properties, and whether we can find any direct evidence for high covering
factors from the infrared (IR) emission. We find that X-ray low-scattering AGN
are preferentially hosted by highly-inclined galaxies or merger systems as
compared to other Seyfert galaxies, increasing the likelihood that the
line-of-sight toward the AGN intersects with high columns of host-galactic gas
and dust. Moreover, while a detailed analysis of the IR emission of
low-scattering AGN ESO 103-G35 remains inconclusive, we do not find any
indication of systematically higher dust covering factors in a sample of
low-scattering AGN based on their IR emission. For ESO 103-G35, we constrained
the temperature, mass and location of the IR emitting dust which is consistent
with expectations for the dusty torus. However, a deep silicate absorption
feature probably from much cooler dust suggests an additional screen absorber
on larger scales within the host galaxy. Taking these findings together, we
propose that the low f_scat observed in low-scattering AGN is not necessarily
the result of circumnuclear dust but could originate from interference of
host-galactic gas with a column density of the order of 10^22 cm^-2 with the
line-of-sight. We discuss implications of this hypothesis for X-ray models,
high-ionization emission lines, and observed star-formation activity in these
objects.

angular momentum density. We first develop an analytic method to solve this

solve the equation for the tensor mode fluctuations and obtain the expression

corresponding boundary action. We give analytic results of both Hall viscosity

obtained from a gravitational Chern-Simons model. We find that the magnitude of
Hall viscosity to angular momentum density ratio is numerically consistent with
being equal to 1/2 at large SU(2) coupling corresponding to the probe limit, in
agreement with previous results obtained for various quantum fluid systems and
from effective theory approaches. In addition, we find the shear viscosity to

and Lagrangian perturbation theories of large-scale structure. We show that
significant differences exist between them especially when trying to model the
Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). We find that the best available model of
the BAO in real space is the Zel'dovich Approximation (ZA), giving an accuracy
of <~3% at redshift of z=0 in modelling the matter 2-pt function around the
acoustic peak. All corrections to the ZA around the BAO scale are perfectly
perturbative in real space. Any attempt to achieve better precision requires
calibrating the theory to simulations because of the need to renormalize those
corrections. In contrast, theories which do not fully preserve the ZA as their
solution, receive O(1) corrections around the acoustic peak in real space at
z=0, and are thus of suspicious convergence at low redshift around the BAO. As
an example, we find that a similar accuracy of 3% for the acoustic peak is
achieved by Eulerian Standard Perturbation Theory (SPT) at linear order only at
z~4. Thus even when SPT is perturbative, one needs to include loop corrections
for z<~4 in real space. In Fourier space, all models perform similarly, and are
controlled by the overdensity amplitude, thus recovering standard results.
However, that comes at a price. Real space cleanly separates the BAO signal
from non-linear dynamics. In contrast, Fourier space mixes signal from short
mildly non-linear scales with the linear signal from the BAO to the level that
non-linear contributions from short scales dominate. Therefore, one has little
hope in constructing a systematic theory for the BAO in Fourier space.

axes relative to most near-Earth and Main Belt asteroid systems. Confirmed
members have rapidly rotating primaries and satellites that are not tidally
locked. Previously suggested formation mechanisms from impact ejecta, planetary
flybys and directly from rotational fission events cannot satisfy all of the
observations. The newly hypothesized mechanism works as follows: (i) these
systems are formed from rotational fission, (ii) their satellites are tidally
locked, (iii) their orbits are expanded by the BYORP effect, (iv) their
satellites de-synchronize due to the adiabatic invariance between the libration
of the secondary and the mutual orbit, and (v) the secondary avoids
resynchronization due to the the YORP effect. This seemingly complex chain of
events is a natural pathway for binaries with satellites that have particular
shapes, which define the BYORP effect torque that acts on the system. After
detailing the theory, we analyze each of the wide asynchronous binary members
and candidates to assess their most likely formation mechanism. Finally, we
suggest possible future observations to check and constrain our hypothesis.

gravitational wave signals, acting as highly restrictive priors on the signal
morphologies that allow us to extract weak events buried deep in the
instrumental noise. The templates map the waveform shapes to physical
parameters, thus allowing us to produce posterior probability distributions for
these parameters. However, there are attendant dangers in using highly
restrictive signal priors. If strong field gravity is not accurately described
by General Relativity (GR), then using GR templates may result in fundamental
bias in the recovered parameters, or even worse, a complete failure to detect
signals. Here we study such dangers, concentrating on three distinct
possibilities. First, we show that there exist modified theories compatible
with all existing tests that would fail to be detected by the LIGO/Virgo
network using searches based on GR templates, but which would be detected using
a one parameter post-Einsteinian extension. Second, we study modified theories
that produce departures from GR that turn on suddenly at a critical frequency,
producing waveforms that do not naively fit into the simplest parameterized
post-Einsteinian (ppE) scheme. We show that even the simplest ppE templates are
still capable of picking up these strange signals and diagnosing a departure
from GR. Third, we study whether using inspiral-only ppE waveforms for signals
that include merger and ringdown can lead to problems in misidentifying a GR
departure. We present an easy technique that allows us to self-consistently
identify the inspiral portion of the signal, and thus remove these potential
biases, allowing GR tests to be performed on higher mass signals that merge
within the detector band. We close by studying a parameterized waveform model
that may allow us to test GR using the full inspiral-merger-ringdown signal.

exhibit large satellites in their x-ray photoemission (XPS) and x-ray
absorption spectra (XAS). These satellites arise from localized charge-transfer
(CT) excitations that accompany the sudden creation of a core hole. Here we use
a two-step approach to treat such excitations in a localized system embedded in
a condensed system and coupled to a photoelectron. The total XAS is then given
by a convolution of a spectral function representing the localized excitations
and the XAS of the extended system. The local system is modeled roughly in
terms of a simple three-level model, leading to a double-pole approximation for
the spectral function that represents dynamically weighted contributions from
the dominant neutral and charge-transfer excitations. This method is
implemented using a resolvent approach, with potentials, radial wave-functions
and matrix elements from the real-space Green's function code FEFF, and
parameters fitted to XPS experiments. Representative calculations for several
TMOs are found to be in reasonable agreement with experiment.

inertial metric is Minkowski-flat and materialized by a congruence of time-like
geodesics of static observers. The static observers are equipped with the ideal
clocks measuring the proper time that is synchronized with the clocks of the
Hubble observer. The local inertial metric is used for physical measurements of
spacetime intervals with the ideal clocks and rulers. The special conformal
transformation preserves null geodesics but does not keep invariant time-like
geodesics. Moreover, it makes the rate of the local time coordinate dependent
on velocity of the particle which makes impossible to rich the uniform
parameterization of the world lines of static observers and light geodesics
with a single parameter - they differ by the conformal factor of FLRW metric.
It tells us that the metric on the light cone is not Minkowski-flat but depends
on the scale factor of FLRW universe and it can be interpreted as a weak
violation of EEP for photons. The importance of this violation for
gravitational physics is that some of local experiments conducted with
freely-propagating electromagnetic waves may be sensitive to the Hubble
expansion. We show that the Hubble constant H can be measured within the solar
system by means of high-precision spacecraft Doppler tracking as a blue shift
of frequency of radio waves circulating in the Earth-spacecraft radio link. We

observations typically linked with multiplicity of phenotypes in biological
systems. Hysteresis can be viewed as form of the system's persistent memory of
past environmental conditions, while bet-hedging is a diversification strategy
not necessarily associated with any memory. It has been shown that bet-hedging
can increase population growth when phenotype adjusts its switching probability
in response to environmental inputs. Although memory and hysteresis have been
used to generate environment dependent phenotype switching probabilities, their
exact connection to bet-hedging have remained unclear. In this work, using a
simple model that takes into account phenotype switching as well as lag phase
in the population growth occurring after the phenotype switching, it is shown
that memory and hysteresis emerge naturally and are firmly linked to
bet-hedging as organisms attempt to optimize their population growth rate. The
optimal ``magnitude'' of hysteresis is explained to be associated with
stochastic resonance where the characteristic time between subsequent phenotype
switching events is linked to the lag phase delay. Furthermore, hysteretic
switching strategy is shown not to confer any additional population growth
advantage if the environment varies periodically in a deterministic fashion.
This suggests that, while bet-hedging may evolve under some conditions even in
deterministic environments, memory and hysteresis is probably the result of
environmental uncertainty in the presence of lag phase in the switching of
phenotypes.

factorizes the prior on divergence times and ranked topologies, thus allowing
uniform, or any arbitrary prior distribution on ranked topologies. While the
first of these formulations has some attractive properties the algorithm we

the traditional sparse signal recovery approach which decomposes the signal
into the product of a dictionary and a sparse vector, the recently developed
cosparse approach exploits sparsity of the product of an analysis matrix and
the original signal. We apply the cosparse Greedy Analysis Pursuit (GAP)
algorithm for compressive sensing of ECG signals. Moreover, to reduce
processing time, classical signal-channel GAP is generalized to the
multi-channel GAP algorithm, which simultaneously reconstructs multiple signals
with similar support. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method
outperforms the classical sparse multi-channel greedy algorithms in terms of
accuracy and the single-channel cosparse approach in terms of processing speed.

describes the dynamics of an ideal two fluid plasma with massless electrons. We
study the only shock wave family that exists in this system (the other
discontinuities being contact discontinuities and not shocks). We study planar
travelling wave solutions and we find solutions with discontinuities in the
hydrodynamic variables, which arise due to the presence of real characteristics
in Hall-MHD. We introduce a small viscosity into the equations and use the
method of matched asymptotic expansions to show that solutions with a
discontinuity satisfying the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions and also an entropy
condition have continuous shock structures. The lowest order inner equations
reduce to the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, plus an equation which
implies the constancy of the magnetic field inside the shock structure. We are
able to show that the current is discontinuous across the shock, even as the
magnetic field is continuous, and that the lowest order outer equations, which
are the equations for travelling waves in inviscid Hall-MHD, are exactly
integrable. We show that the inner and outer solutions match, which allows us
to construct a family of uniformly valid continuous composite solutions that
become discontinuous when the diffusivity vanishes.

representation can be recovered from a small set of linear measurements. In
classical CS theory, the sampling matrix and representation matrix are assumed
to be known exactly in advance. However, uncertainties exist due to sampling
distortion, finite grids of the parameter space of dictionary, etc. In this
paper, we take a generalized sparse signal model, which simultaneously
considers the sampling and representation matrix uncertainties. Based on the
new signal model, a new optimization model for robust sparse signal
reconstruction is proposed. This optimization model can be deduced with
stochastic robust approximation analysis. Both convex relaxation and greedy
algorithms are used to solve the optimization problem. For the convex
relaxation method, a sufficient condition for recovery by convex relaxation is
given; For the greedy algorithm, it is realized by the introduction of a
pre-processing of the sensing matrix and the measurements. In numerical
experiments, both simulated data and real-life ECG data based results show that
the proposed method has a better performance than the current methods.

Gilbert-Varshamov bound asserts that $M(n,d) \geq n!/V(n,d-1)$ where $V(n,d)$
is the volume of a Hamming sphere of radius $d$ in $\S_n$.
  Recently, Gao, Yang, and Ge showed that this bound can be improved by a
factor $\Omega(\log n)$, when $d$ is fixed and $n \to \infty$. Herein, we
consider the situation where the ratio $d/n$ is fixed and improve the
Gilbert-Varshamov bound by a factor that is \emph{linear in $n$}. That is, we
show that if $d/n < 0.5$, then $$ M(n,d)\geq cn\,\frac{n!}{V(n,d-1)} $$ where
$c$ is a positive constant that depends only on $d/n$. To establish this
result, we follow the method of Jiang and Vardy. Namely, we recast the problem
of bounding $M(n,d)$ into a graph-theoretic framework and prove that the
resulting graph is locally sparse.

properties of open-shell nuclei. Traditionally, they are included in a
mean-field description of atomic nuclei through the approximate
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer or Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov formalism. Purpose: We
propose a new hybrid ''relativistic-mean-field-plus-pairing'' approach in which
pairing is treated exactly so the number of particles is conserved. To verify
the reliability of the formalism, we apply it to the study of both ground-state
properties and isoscalar monopole excitations of the Tin isotopes. Methods:
Accurately-calibrated relativistic mean-field models supplemented by an exact
treatment of pairing correlations are used to compute ground-state observables
along the isotopic chain in Tin. In turn, ground-state densities are used as
input to the calculation of giant monopole resonances through a
constrained-relativistic approach. Results: We compute a variety of
ground-state observables sensitive to pairing correlations as well as the
evolution of giant monopole energies along the isotopic chain in Tin. Whereas
ground-state properties are consistent with experiment, we find that pairing
correlations have a minor effect on the giant monopole energies. Conclusions: A
new mean-field-plus-pairing approach is introduced to compute properties of
open-shell nuclei. The formalism provides an efficient and powerful alternative
to the computation of both ground-state properties and monopole energies of
open-shell nuclei. We find ground-state properties to be well reproduced in
this approach. However, as many have concluded before us, we find that pairing
correlations are unlikely to provide an answer to the question of ''why is Tin
so soft?''

  Introduction",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A hallmark of object-oriented programming is the ability to perform
computation through a set of interacting objects. A common manifestation of
this style is the notion of a package, which groups a set of commonly used
classes together. A challenge in using a package is to ensure that a client
follows the implicit protocol of the package when calling its methods.
Violations of the protocol can cause a runtime error or latent invariant
violations. These protocols can extend across different, potentially
unboundedly many, objects, and are specified informally in the documentation.
As a result, ensuring that a client does not violate the protocol is hard.
  We introduce dynamic package interfaces (DPI), a formalism to explicitly
capture the protocol of a package. The DPI of a package is a finite set of
rules that together specify how any set of interacting objects of the package
can evolve through method calls and under what conditions an error can happen.
We have developed a dynamic tool that automatically computes an approximation
of the DPI of a package, given a set of abstraction predicates. A key property
of DPI is that the unbounded number of configurations of objects of a package
are summarized finitely in an abstract domain. This uses the observation that
many packages behave monotonically: the semantics of a method call over a
configuration does not essentially change if more objects are added to the
configuration. We have exploited monotonicity and have devised heuristics to
obtain succinct yet general DPIs. We have used our tool to compute DPIs for
several commonly used Java packages with complex protocols, such as JDBC,
HashSet, and ArrayList.

primarily on fading binary symmetric and additive exponential noise channels.
For fading binary symmetric channels, a hierarchical coding scheme is
presented, utilizing polar coding both over channel uses and over fading
blocks. The receiver uses its channel state information (CSI) to distinguish
states, thus constructing an overlay erasure channel over the underlying fading
channels. By using this scheme, the capacity of a fading binary symmetric
channel is achieved without CSI at the transmitter. Noting that a fading AWGN
channel with BPSK modulation and demodulation corresponds to a fading binary
symmetric channel, this result covers a fairly large set of practically
relevant channel settings.
  For fading additive exponential noise channels, expansion coding is used in
conjunction to polar codes. Expansion coding transforms the continuous-valued
channel to multiple (independent) discrete-valued ones. For each level after
expansion, the approach described previously for fading binary symmetric
channels is used. Both theoretical analysis and numerical results are
presented, showing that the proposed coding scheme approaches the capacity in
the high SNR regime. Overall, utilizing polar codes in this (hierarchical)

mechanism of triggering material accumulation and star formation. In this work,
we study the gaseous environment of a large sample of bubbles, aiming to
explore the possible evidence of triggered gas accumulation and star formation
in a statistical sense. By cross-matching 6124 Spitzer bubbles from the Milky
Way Project (MWP) and more than 2500 Galactic HII regions, we obtain the
velocity information for 818 MWP bubbles. To study the gaseous environment of
the interstellar bubbles and get rid of the projection effect as much as
possible, we constrain the velocity difference between the bubbles and the
13CO(1-0) emission extracted from the Galactic Ring Survey (GRS). Three
methods: the mean azimuthally averaged radial profile of 13CO emission, the
surface number density of molecular clumps, and the angular cross-correlation
function of MWP bubbles and the GRS molecular clumps are adopted. Significant
over density of molecular gas is found to be close to the bubble rims. 60
percent of the studied bubbles were found to have associated molecular clumps.
By comparing the clump-associated and the clump-unassociated MWP bubbles, we
reveal that the bubbles in associations tend to be larger and thicker in
physical sizes. We speculate that some of the bubble-associated clumps result
from the expansion of bubbles. The fraction of the molecular clumps associated
with the MWP bubbles is estimated to be about 20 percent after considering the
projection effect. For the bubble-clump complexes, we found that the bubbles in
the complexes with associated massive young stellar object(s) (MYSO(s)) have
larger physical sizes, hence the complexes tend to be older. We propose that an
evolutionary sequence might exist between the relative younger
MYSO-unassociated bubble-clump complexes and the MYSO-associated complexes.

by the emission predicted from a stratified disk seen at large inclination, as
has been proposed for this source by Lykou et al and by Smith and Gehrz. The
principal new results in this paper relate to the distribution and properties
of the dust that emits the infrared radiation. In particular, a considerable
fraction of this material is spread uniformly through the lobes, although the
dust density does increase at the sharp outer edge seen in higher resolution
optical images of M2-9. The dust grain population in the lobes shows that small
($<$ 0.1 $\mu m$) and large ($>$ 1 $\mu m$) particles appear to be present in
roughly equal amounts by mass. We suggest that collisional processing within
the bipolar outflow plays an important role in establishing the particle size

computation of Euclidean Wilson loops in the context of the AdS/CFT
correspondence, or, equivalently, the problem of finding minimal area surfaces
in hyperbolic space (Euclidean AdS3). If the Wilson loop is given by a boundary
curve X(s) we define, using the integrable properties of the system, a family
of curves X(lambda,s) depending on a complex parameter lambda known as the
spectral parameter. This family has remarkable properties. As a function of
lambda, X(lambda,s) has cuts and therefore is appropriately defined on a
hyperelliptic Riemann surface, namely it determines the spectral curve of the
problem. Moreover, X(lambda,s) has an essential singularity at the origin
lambda=0. The coefficients of the expansion of X(lambda,s) around lambda=0,
when appropriately integrated along the curve give the area of the
corresponding minimal area surface.
  Furthermore we show that the same construction allows the computation of
certain surfaces with one or more boundaries corresponding to Wilson loop
correlators. We extend the area formula for that case and give some concrete
examples. As the main example we consider a surface ending on two concentric
circles and show how the boundary circles can be deformed by introducing extra
cuts in the spectral curve.

our own measurements of $61$ spectroscopic cluster redshifts, and $48$ velocity
dispersions each calculated with more than $15$ member galaxies. This catalog
also includes $19$ dispersions of SPT-observed clusters previously reported in
the literature. The majority of the clusters in this paper are SPT-discovered;
of these, most have been previously reported in other SPT cluster catalogs, and
five are reported here as SPT discoveries for the first time. By performing a
resampling analysis of galaxy velocities, we find that unbiased velocity
dispersions can be obtained from a relatively small number of member galaxies

determine statistical confidence intervals that include the effect of
membership selection. We fit scaling relations between the observed cluster
velocity dispersions and mass estimates from SZ and X-ray observables. In both
cases, the results are consistent with the scaling relation between velocity
dispersion and mass expected from dark-matter simulations. We measure a
$\sim$30% log-normal scatter in dispersion at fixed mass, and a $\sim$10%
offset in the normalization of the dispersion-mass relation when compared to
the expectation from simulations, which is within the expected level of
systematic uncertainty.

efficiency by detecting the spontaneous emission from an atomic ensemble, then
applying a population-inverting pulse to rephase the ensemble and produce a

efficiency of the production are determined for several variants of the scheme.
For an ensemble of uniform optical density, generating the initial spontaneous
emission and its echo using transitions of different strengths is shown to
produce single photons at 70% efficiency, limited by reabsorption. Tailoring

of inter-coupled, inhomogeneously broadened two-level systems, enhanced by high
quality factor electromagnetic cavity modes. In this previously unobserved form
of population inversion, an inseparable quantum system leads to cavity-enhanced
stimulated emission arising from interactions within an ensemble of two-level
systems, as opposed to a traditional ensemble of noninteracting identical three
level systems. The effect is observed in a cryogenically cooled whispering
gallery mode sapphire resonator containing dilute Fe$^{3+}$ impurity ions.
These ions exhibit strong spin-lattice interaction, leading to both electron
spin resonance broadening and phonon mediated spin-spin coupling. The maser
effect is due to a $\left|1/2\right\rangle \rightarrow \left|3/2\right\rangle$
energy transition in electron spin angular momentum observed at zero external
magnetic field. Both continuous and oscillating regimes are observed with
corresponding thresholds both in detuning frequency and incident power.

system (TDCS) has been proposed to support multiuser communications through
spectrum bin nulling and frequency domain spreading. In TDCS-based CRNs, each
user is assigned a specific pseudorandom spreading sequence. However, the
existence of multiuser interference (MUI) is one of main concerns, due to the
non-zero cross-correlations between any pair of TDCS signals. In this paper, a
novel framework of TDCS-based CRNs with the joint design of sequences and
modulation schemes is presented to realize MUI avoidance. With the uncertainty
of spectrum sensing results in CRNs, we first introduce a unique sequence
design through two-dimensional time-frequency synthesis and obtain a class of
almost perfect sequences. That is, periodic auto-correlation and
cross-correlations are identically zero for most circular shifts. These
correlation properties are further exploited in conjunction with a
specially-designed cyclic code shift keying in order to achieve the advantage
of MUI avoidance. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed TDCS-based

asymptotic theory established that there exists a local minimum possessing the
oracle property under general conditions, it is still largely an open problem
how to identify the oracle estimator among potentially multiple local minima.
There are two main obstacles: (1) due to the presence of multiple minima, the
solution path is nonunique and is not guaranteed to contain the oracle
estimator; (2) even if a solution path is known to contain the oracle
estimator, the optimal tuning parameter depends on many unknown factors and is
hard to estimate. To address these two challenging issues, we first prove that
an easy-to-calculate calibrated CCCP algorithm produces a consistent solution
path which contains the oracle estimator with probability approaching one.
Furthermore, we propose a high-dimensional BIC criterion and show that it can
be applied to the solution path to select the optimal tuning parameter which
asymptotically identifies the oracle estimator. The theory for a general class
of nonconvex penalties in the ultra-high dimensional setup is established when
the random errors follow the sub-Gaussian distribution. Monte Carlo studies
confirm that the calibrated CCCP algorithm combined with the proposed

followed by an emulsion part. Together, they allow to achieve 1$%$ precision on
the measurement of $\bar{g}$ with about 600 reconstructed and time tagged

cannot obtain the exact evaluation of a solution but only a noisy one. For
noisy optimization tasks, evolutionary algorithms (EAs), a kind of stochastic
metaheuristic search algorithm, have been widely and successfully applied.
Previous work mainly focuses on empirical studying and designing EAs for noisy
optimization, while, the theoretical counterpart has been little investigated.
In this paper, we investigate a largely ignored question, i.e., whether an
optimization problem will always become harder for EAs in a noisy environment.
We prove that the answer is negative, with respect to the measurement of the
expected running time. The result implies that, for optimization tasks that
have already been quite hard to solve, the noise may not have a negative
effect, and the easier a task the more negatively affected by the noise. On a
representative problem where the noise has a strong negative effect, we examine
two commonly employed mechanisms in EAs dealing with noise, the re-evaluation
and the threshold selection strategies. The analysis discloses that the two
strategies, however, both are not effective, i.e., they do not make the EA more
noise tolerant. We then find that a small modification of the threshold
selection allows it to be proven as an effective strategy for dealing with the
noise in the problem.

production of the first large-scale magnetic fields. For this reason we present
a set of high resolution simulations studying the effect of supernova

initially small-scale magnetic field formed during the collapse of the halo. We
vary the degree of magnetization, the halo mass, and the amount of explosion
energy in order to account for expected variations as well as to infer
systematical dependencies of the results on initial conditions. Our simulations
suggest that core collapse supernovae with an explosion energy of 10^51 erg and
more violent pair instability supernovae with 10^53 erg are able to disrupt
halos with masses up to a about 10^6 and 10^7 M_sun, respectively. The peak of
the magnetic field spectra shows a continuous shift towards smaller k-values,
i.e. larger length scales, over time reaching values as low as k = 4. On small
scales the magnetic energy decreases at the cost of the energy on large scales
resulting in a well-ordered magnetic field with a strength up to ~ 10^-8 G
depending on the initial conditions. The coherence length of the magnetic field
inferred from the spectra reaches values up to 250 pc in agreement with those
obtained from autocorrelation functions. We find the coherence length to be as
large as $50\%$ of the radius of the supernova bubble. Extrapolating this
relation to later stages we suggest that significantly strong magnetic fields
with coherence lengths as large as 1.5 kpc could be created. We discuss
possible implications of our results on processes like recollapse of the halo,
first galaxy formation, and the magnetization of the intergalactic medium.

dynamic processes may enter in the description of equilibrium states. In order
to do that a characteristic time is associated with closed paths. For large
isolated systems at equilibrium or for systems in contact with a thermostat our
results are identical with those obtained with the Gibbs ensemble methods. For
a model used in the microscopic approaches of the brownian motion no new basic
assumption is required to predict a transition from a quantum state to a
classical one exhibiting a time-irreversible behavior. This demonstration is
sufficient to show that very well accepted approximations can lead to
time-irreversible behaviors for a large class of systems. The difference
between our work and the system+reservoir approaches is underlined. Here
equilibrium states and irreversible processes are described on the same footing
representing a progress in the question of time-irreversibility in statistical
physics. The transition function is also used for describing a small system for
which there is no thermodynamics. By adding to the transition function a second
one characterizing the reverse motion we may describe time-reversible systems.
In a simple case we replace two real valued transition functions by a complex
function verifying a Schrodinger like equation. From this we see how to break
the time-reversibility of this equation and how to investigate the connection

reproducing common SNe Ia. The more massive mergers produce unusually luminous
SNe Ia with peak luminosities approaching those attributed to
""super-Chandrasekhar"" mass SNe Ia. While the synthetic light curves and spectra
of some of the models resemble observed SNe Ia, the significant asymmetry of
the ejecta leads to large orientation effects. The peak bolometric luminosity
varies by more than a factor of 2 with the viewing angle, and the velocities of
the spectral absorption features are lower when observed from angles where the

ultraviolet, where the flux varies by more than an order of magnitude. Despite
the large variation with viewing angle, the set of three models roughly obeys a

always available at the same laboratory and, consequently, such direct
measurements would demand a large amount of beam time and would take probably
some years to be reached. Because of that, the measurements of elastic
scattering angular distributions that cover full angular ranges and optical
model analysis have been used for the determination of reaction cross sections.
This traditional method consists in deriving the parameters of the complex
optical potentials which fit the experimental elastic scattering angular
distributions and then of deriving the reaction cross sections predicted by
these potentials. Even so, both the experimental part and the analysis of this
latter method are not so simple. In the present work we present a much simpler
methods to determine reaction and capture (fusion) cross sections. They consist
of measuring only elastic or quasi-elastic scattering at one backward angle,

Theory (DFT) can be determined without empiricism via a Quantum Monte Carlo
(QMC) procedure. The idea consists of a nested iterative loop where the
configurational space of the electrons in the QMC procedure is determined by a
trial oneparticle electron density; this allows then for the determination of a
first guess for the energy functional, which is then in turn used for a DFT
minimization process. This latter delivers a new electron density and the loop
is repeated iteratively until convergence is reached and thus the electronic
structure of the system determined. In essence, from the applied point of view,
such an approach is a compromise between the large computational cost but high
accuracy of QMC and the reasonable computational cost but lower accuracy of
DFT. The proposed approach goes beyond the standard Kohn-Sham method, which is
the standard in DFT, and requires neither orbitals nor the a priori
specification of the exchange and correlation functional. From the conceptual
point of view, the relevant aspect is that the 3N-dimensional wavefunction is
derived as a function(al) of the three-dimensional electron density, which is
the key principle of DFT.

playing a major role in the magnitude of the sub-barrier fusion (capture) cross
sections. There are a several experimental evidences which confirm the
importance of nuclear deformation on the fusion. The influence of nuclear
deformation is straightforward. If the target nucleus is prolate in the ground
state, the Coulomb field on its tips is lower than on its sides, that then
increases the capture or fusion probability at energies below the barrier
corresponding to the spherical nuclei. The role of neutron transfer reactions
is less clear. The importance of neutron transfer with positive Q-values on
nuclear fusion (capture) originates from the fact that neutrons are insensitive
to the Coulomb barrier and therefore they can start being transferred at larger
separations before the projectile is captured by target-nucleus. Therefore, it
is generally thought that the sub-barrier fusion cross section will increase
because of the neutron transfer. The fusion (capture) dynamics induced by
loosely bound radioactive ion beams is currently being extensively studied.
However, the long-standing question whether fusion (capture) is enhanced or
suppressed with these beams has not yet been answered unambiguously. The study
of the fusion reactions involving nuclei at the drip-lines has led to
contradictory results.

actions) with bandit feedback, is known to have complexity in the order of the
dimension of the problem. The exponential weighted strategy achieves the best
known regret bound that is of the order of $d^{2}\sqrt{n}$ (where $d$ is the
dimension of the problem, $n$ is the time horizon). However, such strategies
are provably suboptimal or computationally inefficient. The complexity is
attributed to the combinatorial structure of the action set and the dearth of
efficient exploration strategies of the set. Mirror descent with entropic
regularization function comes close to solving this problem by enforcing a
meticulous projection of weights with an inherent boundary condition. Entropic
regularization in mirror descent is the only known way of achieving a
logarithmic dependence on the dimension. Here, we argue otherwise and recover
the original intuition of exponential weighting by borrowing a technique from
discrete optimization and approximation algorithms called `extended
formulation'. Such formulations appeal to the underlying geometry of the set

bubble of NGC1313 X-2 to explore the physics of super-Eddington accretion.
Beyond the Eddington luminosity, the accretion disk of NGC1313 X-2 is truncated
at a large radius ($\sim$ 50 times of innermost stable circular orbit), and
displays the similar evolution track with both luminous Galactic black-hole and
neutron star X-ray binaries. In super-critical accretion, the speed of
radiatively driven outflows from the inner disk is mildly relativistic. Such
ultra-fast outflows would be over ionized and might produce weak Fe K
absorption lines, which may be detected by the coming X-ray mission {\it
Astro-H}. If the NGC1313 X-2 is a massive stellar X-ray binary, the high
luminosity indicates that an ephemeral feast is held in the source. That is,
the source must be accreting at a hyper-Eddington mass rate to give the
super-Eddington emission over $\sim 10^{4}-10^{5}$ yr. The expansion of the
surrounding bubble nebula with a velocity of $\sim$ 100 km~s$^{-1}$ might
indicate that it has existed over $\sim 10^{6}$ yr and is inflated by the
radiatively driven outflows from the transient with a duty cycle of activity of
$\sim$ a few percent. Alternatively, if the surrounding bubble nebula is
produced by line-driven winds, less energy is required than the radiatively
driven outflow scenario, and the radius of the Str\""{o}mgren radius agrees with
the nebula size. Our results are in favor of the line-driven winds scenario,
which can avoid the conflict between the short accretion age and the apparently
much longer bubble age inferred from the expansion velocity in the nebula.

with a sharp inner edge near 133 au. A low-mass, common proper motion companion
(Fom b), was discovered near the inner edge and was identified as a planet
candidate that could account for the belt morphology. However, the most recent
orbit determination based on four epochs of astrometry over eight years reveals
a highly eccentric orbit that appears to cross the belt in the sky plane
projection. We perform here a full orbital determination based on the available
astrometric data to independently validate the orbit estimates previously
presented. Adopting our values for the orbital elements and their associated
uncertainties, we then study the dynamical interaction between the planet and
the dust ring, to check whether the proposed disk sculpting scenario by Fom b
is plausible. We used a dedicated MCMC code to derive the statistical
distributions of the orbital elements of Fom b. Then we used symplectic N-body
integration to investigate the dynamics of the dust belt, as perturbed by a
single planet. Different attempts were made assuming different masses for Fom
b. We also performed a semi-analytical study to explain our results. Our
results are in good agreement with others regarding the orbit of Fom b. We find
that the orbit is highly eccentric, is close to apsidally aligned with the
belt, and has a moderate mutual inclination relative to the belt plane of. If
coplanar, this orbit crosses the disk. Our dynamical study then reveals that
the observed planet could sculpt a transient belt configuration with a similar
eccentricity to what is observed, but it would not be simultaneously apsidally
aligned with the planet. This transient configuration only occurs a short time
after the planet is placed on such an orbit (assuming an initially circular
disk), a time that is inversely proportional to the planet's mass, and that is
in any case much less than the 440 Myr age of the star. We constrain how long
the observed dust belt could have survived with Fom b on its current orbit, as
a function of its possible mass. This analysis leads us to conclude that Fom b
is likely to have low mass, that it is unlikely to be responsible for the
sculpting of the belt, and that it supports the hypothesis of a more massive,
less eccentric planet companion Fom c.

Structures (LCSs) with ridges of the forward finite-time Lyapunov exponent
(FTLE) field, and attracting LCSs with ridges of the backward FTLE. We show
that in two-dimensional incompressible flows attracting LCSs appear as ridges
of the forward FTLE field, too. This raises the issue of characterization of
attracting LCSs from a forward finite-time Lyapunov analysis. To this end, we
extend recent results by Haller & Sapsis (2011) [1], regarding the relation
between forward and backward maximal and minimal FTLEs, to both the whole
finite-time Lyapunov spectrum and to stretch directions. This is accomplished
by considering the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the linearized flow
map. By virtue of geometrical insights from the SVD, we give a short and direct
proof of the main result of Farazmand & Haller (2013) [2], and prove a new
characterization of attracting LCSs in forward time for Haller's variational
approach to hyperbolic LCSs [3]. We apply these results to the attracting FTLE
ridge of the incompressible saddle flow.

points to the existence of a larger dual gravitational consistent truncation,
which in the gauge theory flat-space limit reduces to a PW flow. Such

emergence and cancellation in active region NOAA 11515 caused an eruptive M5.6
flare on 2012 July 2. Our study employs multi-wavelength observations from HMI,
AIA and ChroTel. Emerging flux formed a neutral line ahead of the leading
sunspot and new satellite spots. The sunspot splitting caused a long-lasting
flow toward this neutral line, where a filament formed. Further flux emergence,
partly of mixed-polarity, as well as episodes of flux cancellation occurred
repeatedly at the neutral line. Following a nearby C-class precursor flare with
signs of interaction with the filament, the filament erupted nearly
simultaneously with the onset of the M5.6 flare and evolved into a coronal mass
ejection. The sunspot stretched without forming a light bridge, splitting
unusually fast (within about a day, complete approximately 6 hours after the
eruption) in two nearly equal parts. The front part separated strongly from the
active region to approach the neighbouring active region where all its coronal
magnetic connections were rooted. It also rotated rapidly (by 4.9 degree/hr)
and caused significant shear flows at its edge. The eruption resulted from a
complex sequence of processes in the (sub-)photosphere and corona. The
persistent flows toward the neutral line likely caused the formation of a flux
rope which held the filament. These flows and their associated flux
cancellation, the emerging flux, and the precursor flare all contributed to the
destabilization of the flux rope. We interpret the sunspot splitting as the
separation of two flux bundles differently rooted in the convection zone and
only temporarily joined in the spot. This explains the rotation as continued
rise of the separating flux and implies that at least this part of the sunspot
was still connected to its roots deep in the convection zone.

large-scale surface magnetic maps, suggesting that the complexity of the
magnetic field can play an important role in the angular momentum evolution of
the star, possibly explaining the large distribution of periods in field dM
stars, as reported in recent works. In spite of the diversity of the magnetic
field topologies among the stars in our sample, we find that stellar wind
flowing near the (rotational) equatorial plane carries most of the stellar
angular momentum, but there is no preferred colatitude contributing to mass
loss, as the mass flux is maximum at different colatitudes for different stars.
We find that more non-axisymmetric magnetic fields result in more asymmetric
mass fluxes and wind total pressures $p_{\rm tot}$ (defined as the sum of
thermal, magnetic and ram pressures). Because planetary magnetospheric sizes
are set by pressure equilibrium between the planet's magnetic field and $p_{\rm
tot}$, variations of up to a factor of $3$ in $p_{\rm tot}$ (as found in the
case of a planet orbiting at several stellar radii away from the star) lead to
variations in magnetospheric radii of about 20 percent along the planetary
orbital path. In analogy to the flux of cosmic rays that impact the Earth,
which is inversely modulated with the non-axisymmetric component of the total
open solar magnetic flux, we conclude that planets orbiting M dwarf stars like
DT~Vir, DS~Leo and GJ~182, which have significant non-axisymmetric field
components, should be the more efficiently shielded from galactic cosmic rays,
even if the planets lack a protective thick atmosphere/large magnetosphere of
their own.

$X_1^{-(2n-1)}S_{n,k}$ and $B_{n,k}$ obey an inversion law which generalizes
that of the Stirling numbers of the first and second kind. Both polynomial
families appear as Lie coefficients in expansions of certain derivatives of
higher order. Substituting $D^j(\varphi)$ (the $j$-th derivative of a fixed
function $\varphi$) in place of the indeterminates $X_j$ shows that both
$S_{n,k}$ and $B_{n,k}$ are differential polynomials depending on $\varphi$ and
on its inverse $\overline{\varphi}$, respectively. Some new light is shed
thereby on Comtet's solution of the Lagrange inversion problem in terms of the
Bell polynomials. According to Haiman and Schmitt that solution is essentially
the antipode on the Fa\`{a} di Bruno Hopf algebra. It can be represented by
$X_1^{-(2n-1)}S_{n,1}$. Moreover, a general expansion formula that holds for
the whole family $S_{n,k}$ ($1\leq k\leq n$) is established together with a
closed expression for the coefficients of $S_{n,k}$. Several important
properties of the Stirling numbers are demonstrated to be special cases of
relations between the corresponding polynomials. As a non-trivial example, a
Schl\""omilch-type formula is derived expressing $S_{n,k}$ in terms of the Bell

that Co$_2$FeAl$_{0.5}$Si$_{0.5}$ can form an almost ideal $L2_1$ structure in

relevant conditions. The design of the bulk Be plasma facing components had to

reuse the existing tile supports originally designed to cope with disruption
loads from carbon based tiles and be installed by remote handling. Risk
reduction measures (prototypes, jigs, etc) were implemented to maximize

Restarting the plasma on the ITER-like Wall proved much easier than for the
carbon wall and no deconditioning by disruptions was observed. Disruptions have
been more threatening than expected due to the reduced radiative losses
compared to carbon, leaving most of the plasma magnetic energy to be conducted
to the wall and requiring routine disruption mitigation. The main chamber power

possibility of device functionalities to various kinds of applications. In
order to extract novel device functionalities in the heterostructures, one
needs to fabricate high quality films and interfaces with minimal impurities,
defects, and disorder. With employing molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) and single
crystal ZnO substrates, the density of residual impurities and defects can be
drastically reduced and the optical and electrical properties have been
dramatically improved for the ZnO films and heterostructures with MgxZn1-xO.
Here, we overview such recent technological advancement from various aspects of
application. Towards optoelectronic devices such as a light emitter and a
photodetector in an ultraviolet region, the development of p-type ZnO and the
fabrication of excellent Schottky contact, respectively, have been subjected to
intensive studies for years. For the former, the fine tuning of the growth
conditions to make MgxZn1-xO as intrinsic as possible has opened the
possibilities of making p-type MgxZn1-xO through NH3 doping method. For the
latter, conducting and transparent polymer films spin-coated on MgxZn1-xO was
shown to give almost ideal Schottky junctions. The wavelength-selective
detection can be realized with varying the Mg content. From the viewpoint of
electronic devices, two-dimensional electrons confined at the MgxZn1-xO/ZnO
interfaces are promising candidate for quantum devices because of high electron
mobility and strong electron-electron correlation effect. These wonderful
features and tremendous opportunities in ZnO-based heterostructures make this
system unique and promising in oxide electronics and will lead to new quantum
functionalities in optoelectronic devices and electronic applications with
lower energy consumption and high performance.

dimension $d$ require block length $n>d^{2+\lambda}$ for some fixed, positive
$\lambda >0$. Geometrically, this means that if $n$ vectors in $R^d$ are such
that each vector is spanned by a linear number of disjoint triples of others,
then it must be that $n > d^{2+\lambda}$. This improves the known quadratic
lower bounds (e.g. {KdW04, Wood07}). While a modest improvement, we expect that
the new techniques introduced in this work will be useful for further progress
on lower bounds of locally correctable and decodable codes with more than 2
queries, possibly over other fields as well.
  Our proof introduces several new ideas to existing lower bound techniques,
several of which work over every field. At a high level, our proof has two
parts, {\it clustering} and {\it random restriction}.
  The clustering step uses a powerful theorem of Barthe from convex geometry.
It can be used (after preprocessing our LCC to be {\it balanced}), to apply a
basis change (and rescaling) of the vectors, so that the resulting unit vectors
become {\it nearly isotropic}. This together with the fact that any LCC must
have many `correlated' pairs of points, lets us deduce that the vectors must
have a surprisingly strong geometric clustering, and hence also combinatorial
clustering with respect to the spanning triples.
  In the restriction step, we devise a new variant of the dimension reduction
technique used in previous lower bounds, which is able to take advantage of the
combinatorial clustering structure above. The analysis of our random projection
method reduces to a simple (weakly) random graph process, and works over any
field.

various physics phenomena. Recently these experiments came into focus to search
for $U(1)$ extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics at low
energies. These extensions are motivated from anomalies in astrophysical
observations as well as from deviations from Standard Model predictions, such
as the discrepancy between the experimental and theoretical determination of
the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. They also arise naturally when the
Standard Model is embedded into a more general theory. In the considered $U(1)$
extensions a new, light messenger particle $\gamma^\prime$, the hidden photon,
couples to the hidden sector as well as to the electromagnetic current of the
Standard Model by kinetic mixing, which allows for a search for this particle
e.g. in the invariant mass distribution of the process $e (A,\,Z)\rightarrow e
(A,\,Z) l^+ l^-$. In this process the hidden photon is emitted by
bremsstrahlung and decays into a pair of Standard Model leptons. In this work
we study the applicability of the Weizs\""acker-Williams approximation to
calculate the signal cross section of the process, which is widely used to
design such experimental setups. Furthermore, based on a previous work, we
investigate the discovery potential of future experimental setups at the

setting the optimal renormalization scales for high-energy processes, which can
eliminate the conventional renormalization scale error via an order-by-order
manner. At present, we make a detailed PMC analysis on the Higgs decay
$H\rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ up to three-loop QCD corrections. As an important
point of deriving reliable PMC estimation, it is noted that only those
$\{\beta_i\}$-terms that rightly determine the running behavior of coupling
constant via the renormalization group equation should be absorbed into the
coupling constant, and those $\{\beta_i\}$-terms that pertain to the quark mass
renormalization and etc. should be kept as a separate. To avoid confusion of
separating and absorbing different types of $\{\beta_i\}$-terms into the
coupling constant, we first transform the decay width in terms of top quark
$\overline{\rm MS}$ mass into that of on-shell mass and then apply the PMC
scale setting. After applying PMC scale setting, the final estimation is
conformal and is scheme-independent and scale-independent. Up to three-loop QCD
corrections, we obtain a PMC scale $\mu^{\rm PMC}_{r}=242.3$ GeV $\sim 2M_H$,
which is optimal and highly independent of any choice of initial scale. Thus,
we obtain a more accurate scale-independent prediction by taking the Higgs mass
as the same as that of ATLAS and CMS measurements, i.e., $\Gamma(H\rightarrow
\gamma\gamma)|_{\rm ATLAS}=9.504^{+0.226}_{-0.252}$ keV and
$\Gamma(H\rightarrow \gamma\gamma)|_{\rm CMS}=9.568^{+0.195}_{-0.191}$ keV,
where the error is caused by the measured Higgs mass, i.e. the Higgs mass

years to tackle the inter-cell interference. In practice, latency and
throughput constraints on the backhaul allow the organization of only small
clusters of base stations (BSs) where joint processing (JP) can be implemented.
In this work we focus on downlink CoMP-JP with multiple antenna user equipments
(UEs) and propose a novel dynamic clustering algorithm. The additional degrees
of freedom at the UE can be used to suppress the residual interference by using
an interference rejection combiner (IRC) and allow a multistream transmission.
In our proposal we first define a set of candidate clusters depending on
long-term channel conditions. Then, in each time block, we develop a resource
allocation scheme by jointly optimizing transmitter and receiver where: a)
within each candidate cluster a weighted sum rate is estimated and then b) a
set of clusters is scheduled in order to maximize the system weighted sum rate.
Numerical results show that much higher rates are achieved when UEs are
equipped with multiple antennas. Moreover, as this performance improvement is
mainly due to the IRC, the gain achieved by the proposed approach with respect
to the non-cooperative scheme decreases by increasing the number of UE
antennas.

determined from the velocity vectors at each spiral phase. It is revealed that
the distributions of the shear strength and of GMAs are anti-correlated. GMAs
exist only in the area of the weak shear strength and further on the upstream
side of the high shear strength. GMAs and most of GMCs exist in the regions
where the shear critical surface density is smaller than the gravitational
critical surface density, indicating that they can stably grow by self-gravity
and the collisional agglomeration of small clouds without being destroyed by
shear motion. These indicate that the shear motion is an important factor in

Fermi level is pinned at valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum
(CBM) for full coverage by NH3 molecules and NH2 radicals, respectively. For
the crossover content of ammonia of about 25% monolayer (ML), the Fermi level
is unpinned. It was shown that hydrogen adsorption energy depends on the doping
in the bulk for the unpinned Fermi level, i.e. for this coverage. Surface
structure thermodynamic and mechanical stability criteria are defined and
compared. Mechanical stability of the coverage of such surfaces was checked by
determination of the desorption energy of hydrogen molecules. Thermodynamic
stability analysis indicates that initally equilibrium hydrogen vapor partial
pressure steeply increases with NH3 content to attain the crossover NH3/NH2
coverage, i.e. the unpinned Fermi level condition. For such condition the
entire range of experimentally accessible pressures belongs showing that vapor
growth of semiconductor crystals occurs predominantly for unpinned Fermi level
at the surface, i.e. for flat bands. Accordingly, adsorption energy of most
species depends on the doping in the bulk that is basis of the possible
molecular scenario explaining dependence of the growth and the doping of
semiconductor crystals on the doping in the bulk

catastrophe theory forms the basis of our analysis.
  This two-dimensional analysis involves a profound assessment of the
Lagrangian and Eulerian projections of the gravitationally evolving
four-dimensional phase-space manifold. It involves the identification of the
complete family of singularity classes, and the corresponding caustics that we
see emerging as structure in Eulerian space evolves. In particular, as it is
instrumental in outlining the spatial network of the cosmic web, we investigate
the nature of spatial connections between these singularities.
  The major finding of our study is that all singularities are located on a set
of lines in Lagrangian space. All dynamical processes related to the caustics
are concentrated near these lines. We demonstrate and discuss extensively how
all 2D singularities are to be found on these lines. When mapping this spatial
pattern of lines to Eulerian space, we find a growing connectedness between
initially disjoint lines, resulting in a percolating network. In other words,
the lines form the blueprint for the global geometric evolution of the cosmic
web.

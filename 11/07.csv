  Abstract and Introduction are revised",,"10.1016/j.optcom.2013.01.060",,"math.SG math.DG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the literature, there are two different versions of Hard Lefschetz
theorems for a compact Sasakian manifold. The first version, due to
Kacimi-Alaoui, asserts that the basic cohomology of a compact Sasakian manifold
satisfies the transverse Lefschetz property. The second version, established
far more recently by Cappelletti-Montano, De Nicola, and Yudin, holds for the
De Rham cohomology of a compact Sasakian manifold. In the current paper, using
the formalism of odd dimensional symplectic geometry, we prove a Hard Lefschetz
theorem for a compact $K$-contact manifold, which implies immediately that the
two existing versions of Hard Lefschetz theorems are mathematically equivalent
to each other.
  Our method sheds new light on the Hard Lefschetz property of a Sasakian
manifold. It enables us to give a simple construction of simply-connected
$K$-contact manifolds without any Sasakian structures in any dimension $\geq
9$, and answers an open question asked by Boyer and late Galicki concerning the
existence of such examples. It also allows us to establish a sufficient and
necessary condition for a finitely presentable group to be the fundamental
group of a compact Lefschetz contact five manifold. As an immediate
application, we use it to produce first examples of compact Lefschetz contact
manifolds which do not support any Sasakian structures. This provides an answer
to another open question asked by Cappelletti-Montano, De Nicola, and Yudin in
their recent work.

for end-to-end resource management in converged next generation networks by
enabling unified, adaptive and scalable solutions that integrate and

heterogeneous access technologies. In our project, a PBNM framework for

framework consists of distributed functional entities managed within a
policy-based infrastructure to provide QoS and resource management in converged
networks. Within any QoS control framework, an effective admission control
scheme is essential for maintaining the QoS of flows present in the network.
Measurement based admission control (MBAC) and parameter based admission
control (PBAC) are two commonly used approaches. This paper presents the
implementation and analysis of various measurement-based admission control
schemes developed within a Java-based prototype of our policy-based framework.
The evaluation is made with real traffic flows on a Linux-based experimental
testbed where the current prototype is deployed. Our results show that unlike
with classic MBAC or PBAC only schemes, a hybrid approach that combines both
methods can simultaneously result in improved admission control and network
utilization efficiency.

designed for analyzing a single gene expression experiment. When data from
multiple related gene expression studies are available, separately analyzing
each study is not an ideal strategy as it may fail to detect important genes
with consistent but relatively weak differential signals in multiple studies.
Jointly modeling all data allows one to borrow information across studies to
improve the analysis. However, a simple concordance model, in which each gene
is assumed to be differential in either all studies or none of the studies, is
incapable of handling genes with study-specific differential expression. In
contrast, a model that naively enumerates and analyzes all possible
differential patterns across all studies can deal with study-specificity and
allow information pooling, but the complexity of its parameter space grows
exponentially as the number of studies increases. Here we propose a
""correlation motif"" approach to address this dilemma. This approach
automatically searches for a small number of latent probability vectors called
""correlation motifs"" to capture the major correlation patterns among multiple
studies. The motifs provide the basis for sharing information among studies and
genes. The approach improves detection of differential expression and overcomes
the barrier of exponentially growing parameter space. It is capable of handling
all possible study-specific differential patterns in a large number of studies.
The advantages of this new approach over existing methods are illustrated using
both simulated and real data.

has demonstrated promising results in a variety of material systems. This
technique utilizes the resonant precession of magnetization in a ferromagnet to
inject spin into an adjacent non-magnetic material. Spin pumping into graphene
is attractive on account of its exceptional spin transport properties. This
article reports on FMR characterization of cobalt grown on CVD graphene and
examines the validity of linewidth broadening as an indicator of spin pumping.
In comparison to cobalt samples without graphene, direct contact
cobalt-on-graphene exhibits increased FMR linewidth--an often used signature of
spin pumping. Similar results are obtained in Co/MgO/graphene structures, where
a 1nm MgO layer acts as a tunnel barrier. However, SQUID, MFM, and Kerr
microscopy measurements demonstrate increased magnetic disorder in cobalt grown
on graphene, perhaps due to changes in the growth process and an increase in
defects. This magnetic disorder may account for the observed linewidth
enhancement due to effects such as two-magnon scattering or mosaicity. As such,
it is not possible to conclude successful spin injection into graphene from FMR
linewidth measurements alone.

only trivial solutions by the auxiliary equations. For proving trivial
solutions of the quartic equations we use method infinite descent based on the
number of prime integers of the solution of the auxiliary equation. The quartic
equations with only trivial solutions belong to ""higher arithmetic"". The main
tools of their investigation are the fundamental theorem of arithmetic,
infinite descent and elliptic curves. In 1969, L.J. Mordell has observed that
the triviality of the solution of $x^4 + y^4 = 2z^2$ implies the triviality of
the solution of $x^4 + 6x^2y^2 + y^4 = z^2$. In his treatise, he did not study
the reason or the mechanics of this relationship nor did he conjecture that
this link extended to other fourth-degree diophantine equations. We have
discovered that the connection identified by Mordell can be described by using
the concept ""resolvents"". In present notice which carries an expository
character, we show our findings by presenting the reader with a very easy to
follow and transparent example of how the proposed technique works.

in their recent \emph{tour-de-force} work around \emph{heteroclinic
bifurcations of surface diffeomorphisms}.
  The goal of the present article is two-fold. The first part will be a modest
survey on the history of the study of homoclinic/heteroclinic bifurcations of
surface diffeomorphisms: starting from the seminal works of Henri Poincar\'e on
Celestial Mechanics, we will recall some landmark results on bifurcations of
homoclinic/heteroclinic tangencies associated to \emph{uniformly hyperbolic
horseshoes}. Our discussions in this (first) part will culminate with a brief
presentation of the scheme of the proof of the main theorems of J. Palis and
J.-C. Yoccoz on this subject. In particular, we will highlight the main
features of the so-called non-uniformly hyperbolic horseshoes, an object at the
heart of the work of J. Palis and J.-C. Yoccoz. Then, the second part will be a
sort of research announcement where we will discuss some results obtained in
collaboration with J. Palis and J.-C. Yoccoz on the (fractal) geometry of
non-uniformly hyperbolic horseshoes.

interpretation which may correspond to Louis de Broglie's ""double solution
theory"". Louis de Broglie considers two solutions to the Schr\""odinger
equation, a singular and physical wave u representing the particle (soliton
wave) and a regular wave representing probability (statistical wave). We return
to the idea of two solutions, but in the form of an interpretation of the wave
function based on two different preparations of the quantum system. We
demonstrate the necessity of this double interpretation when the particles are
subjected to a semi-classical field by studying the convergence of the
Schr\""odinger equation when the Planck constant tends to 0. For this
convergence, we reexamine not only the foundations of quantum mechanics but
also those of classical mechanics, and in particular two important paradox of
classical mechanics: the interpretation of the principle of least action and
the the Gibbs paradox. We find two very different convergences which depend on
the preparation of the quantum particles: particles called indiscerned
(prepared in the same way and whose initial density is regular, such as atomic
beams) and particles called discerned (whose density is singular, such as
coherent states). These results are based on the Minplus analysis, a new branch
of mathematics that we have developed following Maslov, and on the Minplus path
integral which is the analog in classical mechanics of the Feynman path
integral in quantum mechanics. The indiscerned (or discerned) quantum particles
converge to indiscerned (or discerned) classical particles and we deduce that
the de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave is the correct interpretation for the
indiscerned quantum particles (wave statistics) and the Schr\""odinger
interpretation is the correct interpretation for discerned quantum particles
(wave soliton). Finally, we show that this double interpretation can be

arriving at a structural-glass or a glassy-crystal state. Detailed
investigations using broadband dielectric spectroscopy enable a comparison of
the glassy dynamics in both phases. Just as previously demonstrated for
supercooled-liquid and plastic-crystalline ethanol, our experiments reveal very
similar relaxational behavior and glass temperatures of both disordered states.
Thus the prominent role of orientational degrees of freedom in the glass

Many of the physical properties of 2D systems carry into the quasi-1D case, for
which, unfortunately, the standard 2D DMRG algorithm fares little better. By
finding the form of the entanglement entropy in quasi-1D systems, we directly

inclined precessing circumbinary (CB) ring. The most recent data show the
continued rise of star B with respect to the trailing edge of the occulting
horizon as the system's maximum brightness steadily increases. The wealth of
data in time and wavelength domains allows us to track the long-term CCD color
evolution of KH 15D. We find that the V-I behavior is consistent with direct
and scattered light from the composite color of two stars with slightly
different temperatures. There is no evidence for any reddening or bluing
associated with extinction or scattering by ISM-sized dust grains. Furthermore,
we probe the system's faint phase behavior at near-infrared wavelengths in
order to investigate extinction properties of the ring and signatures of a
possible shepherding planet sometimes invoked to confine the CB ring at ~ 5 AU.
The wavelength independence of eclipse depth at second contact is consistent
with the ring material being fully opaque to 2.2 microns. The color-magnitude
diagrams demonstrate excess flux in J and H at low light levels, which may be
due to the presence of a hot, young Jupiter-mass planet.

between galaxy bias and the amplitude of clustering signal. In a series of two
papers, we perform such an analysis at the highest redshift ($z\sim0.53$) in
the literature using CMASS galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-III Baryon
Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey Eleventh Data Release (SDSS-III/BOSS DR11)
catalog spanning 8300~deg$^2$. In this paper, we present details of the
clustering and weak lensing measurements of these galaxies. We define a
subsample of 400,916 CMASS galaxies based on their redshifts and stellar mass
estimates so that the galaxies constitute an approximately volume-limited and
similar population over the redshift range $0.47\le z\le 0.59$. We obtain a
signal-to-noise ratio $S/N\simeq 56$ for the galaxy clustering measurement. We
also explore the redshift and stellar mass dependence of the clustering signal.
For the weak lensing measurement, we use existing deeper imaging data from the
CFHTLS with publicly available shape and photometric redshift catalogs from
CFHTLenS, but only in a 105~deg$^2$ area which overlaps with BOSS. This
restricts the lensing measurement to only 5,084 CMASS galaxies. After careful
systematic tests, we find a highly significant detection of the CMASS weak
lensing signal, with total $S/N\simeq 26$. These measurements form the basis of
the halo occupation distribution and cosmology analysis presented in More et
al. (Paper II).

sporadic infections. Our approach is based on a spatial-transmission model
integrating mobility data worldwide and allows for variations in the
zoonotic/environmental transmission and underascertainment. Maximum likelihood
estimates for the ME region indicate the occurrence of a subcritical epidemic

appear to be mainly dominated by zoonotic/environmental transmissions, with
possible underascertainment (95% CI of estimated to observed sporadic cases in
the range 1.03-7.32). No time evolution of the situation emerges. Analyses of
flight passenger data from the region indicate areas at high risk of
importation. While dismissing an immediate threat for global health security,
this analysis provides a baseline scenario for future reference and updates,
suggests reinforced surveillance to limit underascertainment, and calls for
increased alertness in high-risk areas worldwide.

determined from the sum of measured $\gamma$-ray cross sections feeding the
ground state from low-lying levels below a cutoff energy, E$_{\rm crit}$, where
the level scheme is completely known, and continuum $\gamma$ rays from levels
above E$_{\rm crit}$, calculated using the Monte Carlo statistical-decay code
DICEBOX. The new cross sections determined in this work for the tungsten

$\sigma_{11/2^{+}}(^{183}{\rm W}^{m}, 5.2 {\rm s}) = 0.177(18)$ b;

earlier measurements in the literature. The $^{186}$W cross section was also
independently confirmed from an activation measurement, following the decay of
$^{187}$W, yielding values for $\sigma_{0}(^{186}{\rm W})$ that are consistent
with our prompt $\gamma$-ray measurement. The cross-section measurements were
found to be insensitive to choice of level density or photon strength model,
and only weakly dependent on E$_{\rm crit}$. Total radiative-capture widths
calculated with DICEBOX showed much greater model dependence, however, the
recommended values could be reproduced with selected model choices. The decay
schemes for all tungsten isotopes were improved in these analyses.

uncertainties resulting from shape noise, cosmic variance, halo sample
variance, and higher-order moments of the density field. We marginalize over
systematic uncertainties arising from photometric redshift errors and shear
calibration biases considering both optimistic and conservative assumptions
about LSST systematic errors.
  We find that even the KL-Stage III is highly competitive with the optimistic
LSST scenario, while evading the most important sources of theoretical and
observational systematic error inherent in traditional weak lensing techniques.
Furthermore, the KL technique enables a narrow-bin cosmic shear tomography
approach to tightly constrain time-dependent signatures in the dark energy
phenomenon.

states of light such as single photons and entangled photons. However, in order
for them to be used as a resource for long-distance quantum communication,
distributed quantum computation, or linear optics quantum computing, these
photons must be coupled efficiently to long-lived quantum memories as part of a
quantum repeater network. Here, we theoretically examine the prospects for
efficient storage and retrieval of a QD-generated single photon with a 1 ns
lifetime in a multi-level atomic system. We calculate using an experimentally
demonstrated optical depth of 150 that the storage (total) efficiency can
exceed 46% (28%) in a dense, ultracold ensemble of $^{87}$Rb atoms.
Furthermore, we find that the optimal control pulse required for storage and
retrieval can be obtained using a diode laser and an electro-optic modulator
rather than a mode-locked, pulsed laser source. Increasing the optical depth,
for example by using Bose-condensed ensembles or an optical cavity, can
increase the efficiencies to near unity. Aside from enabling a high-speed
quantum network based on QDs, such an efficient optical interface between an
atomic ensemble and a QD can also lead to entanglement between collective
spin-wave excitations of atoms and the spin of an electron or hole confined in
the QD.

declining exponentially with time in the last 11Gyrs as
SFR$^*$(T[Gyr])=10$^{4.23/T+0.37}$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, but with no evolution

$\approx$20% by z=0.4, driven by the rise of the passive population. We find
that SFGs with M$\approx$10$^{10.0\pm0.2}$ M$_{\odot}$ contribute most to the

significant evolution in the fractional contribution from SFGs of different

Simulation-calibrated observations suggest a production rate of at most only a
few photons per baryon. In this work, we present a new solution to this
""photon-starvation"" problem using a weak background of cosmic magnetic fields,
which may be present as a consequence of early-Universe physics and subsequent
magneto-hydrodynamical amplification. If present, such magnetic fields can
induce density perturbations which are dominant on scales comparable to those
probed by measurements of hydrogen-absorption lines at redshifts z~2-5. We show
that a sub-nanoGauss magnetic field, coherent on scale ~1 Mpc with an almost
scale-invariant spectrum, is sufficient to produce significant impact on the
effective optical depth, the appearance of the Lyman-{\alpha} forest on quasar
spectra, the pixel-flux statistics and the power spectrum of transmitted flux.
We also show that such magnetic-field signatures are effectively erased when
the metagalactic photoionization rate is increased, hence relaxing the
constraint on the cosmic photon budget available for reionization.

accretion disc, formed by either the merger of two compact objects or the
accretion-induced collapse of a white dwarf. During the EE phase, material is
accelerated to super-Keplarian velocities and ejected from the system by the
rapidly rotating ($P \approx 1 - 10$ ms) and very strong ($10^{15}$ G) magnetic
field in a process known as magnetic propellering. The X-ray plateau is
modelled as magnetic dipole spin-down emission. We first explore the range of
GRB phenomena that the propeller could potentially reproduce, using a series of
template light curves to devise a classification scheme based on phenomology.
We then obtain fits to the light curves of 9 GRBs with EE, simultaneously
fitting both the propeller and the magnetic dipole spin-down and finding
typical disc masses of a few $10^{-3}$ $M_{\odot}$ to a few $10^{-2}$
$M_{\odot}$. This is done for ballistic, viscous disc and exponential accretion
rates. We find that the conversion efficiency from kinetic energy to EM
emission for propellered material needs to be $\gtrsim 10\%$ and that the best
fitting results come from an exponential accretion profile.

that observational constraints on the scatter in galaxy scaling relations can
be translated into constraints on the galaxy-to-galaxy variation in the mass
loading factor, and the timescales and magnitude of stochastic accretion onto

extraction of angular momentum by electromagnetic torques. These torques also
change the obliquity angle $\alpha$ between the magnetic and rotational axes.
Although actual pulsar magnetospheres are plasma-filled, the time evolution of
$\alpha$ has mostly been studied for vacuum pulsar magnetospheres. In this
work, we self-consistently account for the plasma effects for the first time by
analysing the results of time-dependent 3D force-free and magnetohydrodynamic
simulations of pulsar magnetospheres. We show that if a neutron star is
spherically symmetric and is embedded with a dipolar magnetic moment, the
pulsar evolves so as to minimise its spin-down luminosity: both vacuum and
plasma-filled pulsars evolve toward the aligned configuration ($\alpha=0$).
However, they approach the alignment in qualitatively different ways. Vacuum
pulsars come into alignment exponentially fast, with $\alpha \propto
\exp(-t/\tau)$ and $\tau \sim$ spindown timescale. In contrast, we find that
plasma-filled pulsars align much more slowly, with $\alpha \propto
(t/\tau)^{-1/2}$. We argue that the slow time evolution of obliquity of
plasma-filled pulsars can potentially resolve several observational puzzles,
including the origin of normal pulsars with periods of $\sim1$ second, the
evidence that oblique pulsars come into alignment over a timescale of $\sim
10^7$ years, and the observed deficit, relative to an isotropic obliquity
distribution, of pulsars showing interpulse emission.

extra-set of particles to investigate their effect on the halo mass function.
We show that for cosmologies with massive neutrinos the mass function of dark
matter haloes selected using the spherical overdensity (SO) criterion is well
reproduced by the fitting formula of Tinker et al. (2008) once the cold dark
matter power spectrum is considered instead of the total matter power, as it is
usually done. The differences between the two implementations, i.e. using
$P_{\rm cdm}(k)$ instead of $P_{\rm m}(k)$, are more pronounced for large
values of the neutrino masses and in the high end of the halo mass function: in
particular, the number of massive haloes is higher when $P_{\rm cdm}(k)$ is
considered rather than $P_{\rm m}(k)$. As a quantitative application of our
findings we consider a Planck-like SZ-clusters survey and show that the
differences in predicted number counts can be as large as $30\%$ for $\sum
m_\nu = 0.4$ eV. Finally, we use the Planck-SZ clusters sample, with an
approximate likelihood calculation, to derive Planck-like constraints on
cosmological parameters. We find that, in a massive neutrino cosmology, our
correction to the halo mass function produces a shift in the
$\sigma_8(\Omega_{\rm m}/0.27)^\gamma$ relation which can be quantified as
$\Delta \gamma \sim 0.05$ and $\Delta \gamma \sim 0.14$ assuming one
($N_\nu=1$) or three ($N_\nu=3$) degenerate massive neutrino, respectively. The
shift results in a lower mean value of $\sigma_8$ with $\Delta \sigma_8 = 0.01$
for $N_\nu=1$ and $\Delta \sigma_8 = 0.02$ for $N_\nu=3$, respectively. Such
difference, in a cosmology with massive neutrinos, would increase the tension
between cluster abundance and Planck CMB measurements.

grating spectrometer optimized for detecting the faint and broad lines from
distant galaxies that are redshifted into the telluric windows from 200 to 850
microns. It utilizes a focal plane array of transition-edge sensed bolometers,
the first use of these arrays for astrophysical spectroscopy. ZEUS-2 promises
to be an important tool for studying galaxies in the years to come due to its
synergy with ALMA and its capabilities in the short submillimeter windows that
are unique in the post Herschel era. Here we report on our first detection of
the [CII] 158 $\mu m$ line with ZEUS-2. We detect the line at z ~ 1.8 from
H-ATLAS J091043.1-000322 with a line flux of $(6.44 \pm 0.42) \times 10^{-18} W

from a photo-dissociation region with far-ultraviolet radiation field, $G
\approx 2 \times 10^{4} G_{0}$, gas density, $n \approx 1 \times 10^{3}

that H-ATLAS J091043.1-000322 is a high redshift analogue of a local

starburst due to a major merger. Further identification of these merging

proposed in order to mimic the effects of the Milky Way bar in the bulge and

considering the flows of gas from and to the adjacent cylindrical regions. The
most recent data for the bulge metallicity distribution are reproduced by means
of a single and longer bulge collapse time-scale (2 Gyr) than other chemical

present star formation rate at 4 kpc and the formation of the molecular gas
ring. The model with a bar predicts a flattening of the oxygen radial gradient
of the disc. Additionally, models with radial gas flows predict a higher star
formation rate during the formation of the bulge. This is in agreement with the
most recent observations of the star formation rate at the centre of massive
barred spiral galaxies.

stable massive NS remnant rather than a black hole. Due to the substantial
angular momentum from the binary, such a remnant is born rapidly rotating and
likely acquires a strong magnetic field (a `millisecond magnetar'). Magnetic
spin-down deposits a large fraction of the rotational energy from the magnetar
behind the small quantity of mass ejected during the merger. This has the
potential for creating a bright transient that could be useful for determining
whether a NS or black hole was formed in the merger. We investigate the
expected signature of such an event, including for the first time the important
impact of electron/positron pairs injected by the millisecond magnetar into the
surrounding nebula. These pairs cool via synchrotron and inverse Compton
emission, producing a pair cascade and hard X-ray spectrum. A fraction of these
X-rays are absorbed by the ejecta walls and re-emitted as thermal radiation,
leading to an optical/UV transient peaking at a luminosity of ~1e43-1e44 erg/s
on a timescale of several hours to days. This is dimmer than predicted by
simpler analytic models because the large optical depth of electron/positron
pairs across the nebula suppresses the efficiency with which the magnetar spin
down luminosity is thermalized. Nevertheless, the optical/UV emission is more
than two orders of magnitude brighter than a radioactively powered `kilonova.'
In some cases nebular X-rays are sufficiently luminous to re-ionize the ejecta,
in which case non-thermal X-rays escape the ejecta unattenuated with a similar
peak luminosity and timescale as the optical radiation. We discuss the
implications of our results for the temporally extended X-ray emission that is
observed to follow some short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), including the kilonova
candidates GRB 080503 and GRB 130603B.

revealed to be fruitless, imposing constraints on the existence of new scalar
particles. However, it is still possible that any existing heavy scalars would
preferentially decay to final states involving the light Higgs boson thus
evading the current LHC bounds on heavy scalar states. Moreover, decays of the
heavy scalars could increase the number of light Higgs bosons being produced.
Since the number of light Higgs bosons decaying to Standard Model particles is
within the predicted range, this could mean that part of the light Higgs bosons
could have their origin in heavy scalar decays. This situation would occur if
the light Higgs couplings to Standard Model particles were reduced by a
concomitant amount. Using a very simple extension of the SM - the two-Higgs

Georg Cantor (1845-1818), the creator of set theory, was a mathematician who
changed the mathematical thinking per se. By analyzing the philosophy of set
theory this paper shows how was it possible (by introducing into mathematics
what philosophers call 'the subject'). Set theory happened to be the most
radical answer to the crisis of foundations. David Hilbert (1862-1943), facing
the same foundational crisis, came up with his axiomatic method, indeed a
minimalist program whose roots can be traced back to Descartes and Cauchy.
Bringing together these three key authors, the paper is the first attempt to
analyze how the united efforts of philosophy and mathematics helped to dissolve
the epistemological crisis of the 19th century.

sky subtraction strategy was adopted to estimate the brightness and structure
of the sky, a critical step when tracing the light distribution of extended
objects in the near-infrared. From the final image product, bulge and total
magnitudes were extracted via two-dimensional profile fitting. As a first order
approximation, all galaxies were modeled using a simple Sersic-bulge +
exponential-disk decomposition. However, we found that such models did not
adequately describe the structure that we observe in a large fraction of our
sample galaxies which often include cores, bars, nuclei, inner disks, spiral
arms, rings and envelopes. In such cases, we adopted profile modifications
and/or more complex models with additional components. The derived bulge
magnitudes are very sensitive to the details and number of components used in
the models, although total magnitudes remain almost unaffected. Usually, but

simple bulge+disk decomposition is adopted in lieu of a more complex model.

Black Hole (SMBH) masses (Mbh), and their host galaxies' K-band bulge (Lbul)
and total (Ltot) luminosities. The wide-field WIRCam imager at the
Canada-France-Hawaii-Telescope (CFHT) was used to obtain the deepest and
highest resolution near infrared images available for a sample of 35 galaxies
with securely measured Mbh, selected irrespective of Hubble type. For each
galaxy, we derive bulge and total magnitudes using a two-dimensional image
decomposition code that allows us to account, if necessary, for large- and
small-scale disks, cores, bars, nuclei, rings, envelopes and spiral arms. We
find that the present-day Mbh-Lbul and Mbh-Ltot relations have consistent
intrinsic scatter, suggesting that Mbh correlates equally well with bulge and
total luminosity of the host. Our analysis provides only mild evidence of a
decreased scatter if the fit is restricted to elliptical galaxies. The
log-slopes of the Mbh-Lbul and Mbh-Ltot relations are 0.75+/-0.10 and
0.92+/-0.14, respectively. However, while the slope of the Mbh-Lbul relation
depends on the detail of the image decomposition, the characterization of
Mbh-Ltot does not. Given the difficulties and ambiguities of decomposing galaxy
images into separate components, our results indicate that Ltot is more
suitable as a tracer of SMBH mass than Lbul, and that the Mbh-Ltot relation
should be used when studying the co-evolution of SMBHs and galaxies.

The codeword stabilized (CWS) framework is a scheme to construct quantum

and gives a method to construct a QECC from a classical error-correcting code
in standard form. Entangled pairs of qubits (ebits) can be used to improve
capacity of quantum error correction. In addition, it gives a method to
overcome the dual-containing constraint. Operator quantum error correction
(OQEC) gives a general framework to construct quantum error-correcting codes.
We construct OQEC codes with ebits based on the CWS framework. This new scheme,
entanglement-assisted operator codeword stabilized (EAOCWS) quantum codes, is
the most general framework we know of to construct both additive and
nonadditive codes from classical error-correcting codes. We describe the
formalism of our scheme, demonstrate the construction with examples, and give
several EAOCWS codes.

family of high-$T_{c}$ Fe-based superconductors that crystallize in the

replacing Fe with another transition metal; using Mn produces the material
BaMn$_{2}$As$_{2}$, which unlike its Fe-based cousin has an insulating ground
state with a large magnetic moment of $3.9 \mu_{B}$ and G-type
antiferromagnetic order. Despite its lack of superconductivity, the material is
interesting in its own right. Recent experimental studies have shown that
hole-doping the compound by substituting K for Ba leads to metallic behavior
and a spontaneous, weak, in-plane magnetization, which was attributed to the
holes fully polarizing independent of the Mn moments, producing half-metallic
behavior. However the observed in-plane magnetization can also be understood as
a small canting of the Mn moments. Using density functional theory, we
demonstrate that a Mn moment canting occurs upon hole-doping the compound. We
argue that this is due to the competition between the super- and double
exchange interactions, which we support using a simple tight-binding model of
the superexchange-double exchange interaction and the Andersen Force Theorem.
Our calculations also rule out an in-plane polarization of As holes as an
explanation for the in-plane magnetization.

semantics. Distributional semantics presupposes that the meanings of words are
a function of their occurrences in textual contexts. It models words as
distributions over these contexts and represents them as vectors in high
dimensional spaces. The problem of compositionality for such models concerns
itself with how to produce representations for larger units of text by
composing the representations of smaller units of text.
  This thesis focuses on a particular approach to this compositionality
problem, namely using the categorical framework developed by Coecke, Sadrzadeh,
and Clark, which combines syntactic analysis formalisms with distributional
semantic representations of meaning to produce syntactically motivated
composition operations. This thesis shows how this approach can be
theoretically extended and practically implemented to produce concrete
compositional distributional models of natural language semantics. It
furthermore demonstrates that such models can perform on par with, or better
than, other competing approaches in the field of natural language processing.
  There are three principal contributions to computational linguistics in this
thesis. The first is to extend the DisCoCat framework on the syntactic front
and semantic front, incorporating a number of syntactic analysis formalisms and
providing learning procedures allowing for the generation of concrete
compositional distributional models. The second contribution is to evaluate the
models developed from the procedures presented here, showing that they
outperform other compositional distributional models present in the literature.
The third contribution is to show how using category theory to solve linguistic
problems forms a sound basis for research, illustrated by examples of work on
this topic, that also suggest directions for future research.

irradiation by means of numerical, two-dimensional time-dependent
radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of a cloud irradiated by a strong radiation.
We adopt a very simple treatment of the opacity, neglect photoionization and
gravity, and instead focus on assessing the role of the type and magnitude of
the opacity on the cloud evolution. Our main result is that even relatively
dense clouds that are radiatively heated (i.e., with significant absorption
opacity) do not move as a whole instead they undergo a very rapid and major
evolution in its shape, size and physical properties. In particular, the cloud
and its remnants become optical thin within less than one sound crossing time
and before they can travel over a significant distance (a distance of a few
radii of the initial cloud). We also found that a cloud can be accelerated as a
whole under quite extreme conditions, e.g., the opacity must be dominated by
scattering. However, the acceleration due to the radiation force is relatively
small and unless the cloud is optically thin the cloud quickly changes its size
and shape. We discuss implications for the modelling and interpetation broad
line regions of active galactic nuclei.

typically seen in Galactic globular clusters, is present in 47 Tuc, and extends
to include a small number of stars with [O/Fe] $\sim$\,--0.5. Additionally, the
[O/Na] ratios of our sample reveal that the cluster stars can be separated into
three distinct populations. A KS-test demonstrates that the O-poor/Na-rich
stars are more centrally concentrated than the O-rich/Na-poor stars. The
observed number and radial distribution of 47 Tuc's stellar populations, as

However, the photospheric chemical abundances of these magnetic Herbig stars

'normal' non-magnetic Herbig stars remain poorly characterized. To investigate
this issue, we have studied the photospheric compositions of 23 Herbig stars,

used to suck liquids and has the coiling and uncoiling movements. Although
experiments revealed qualitatively that the coiling movement is governed by the
hydraulic mechanism and the uncoiling movement is due to the musculature and
the elasticity, it needs a quantitative investigation to reveal how insects
achieve these behaviors accurately. Here a quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D)
curvature elastica model is proposed to reveal the mechanism of these
behaviors. We find that the functions of internal stipes muscle and basal
galeal muscle which locate at the bottom of proboscis are to adjust the initial
states in the coiling and uncoiling processes, respectively. The function of
internal galeal muscle which exists along proboscis is to adjust the line
tension. The knee bend shape is due to the local maximal spontaneous curvature
and is an advantage for nectar-feeding butterfly. When there is no knee bend,
the proboscis of fruit-piercing butterfly is easy to achieve the piercing
movement which induced by the increase of internal hydraulic pressure. All of
the results are in good agreement with experiential observation. Our study
provides a revelatory method to investigate the mechanical behaviors of other
1D biologic structures, such as proboscis of marine snail and elephant. Our
method and results are also significant in designing the bionic devices.

pattern of standstills and outbursts with little time at quiescence, while IW
And underwent many excursions from quiescence to outburst to short standstills.
The spectra of IW And are similar to normal dwarf novae, with strong Balmer
emission at quiescence and absorption at outburst. In contrast, V513 Cas shows
a much flatter/redder spectrum near outburst with strong HeII emission and
prominent emission cores in the Balmer lines. Part of this continuum difference

properties. This technique constitutes an important part of the science case
for the forthcoming NICER and proposed LOFT X-ray missions. In this paper, we
determine the number of distinct observables that can be derived from pulse
profile modeling and show that using only bolometric pulse profiles is
insufficient for breaking the degeneracy between inferred neutron-star radius
and mass. However, we also show that for moderately spinning (300-800 Hz)
neutron stars, analysis of pulse profiles in two different energy bands
provides additional constraints that allow a unique determination of the
neutron-star properties. Using the fractional amplitudes of the fundamental and
the second harmonic of the pulse profile in addition to the amplitude and phase
difference of the spectral color oscillations, we quantify the signal-to-noise
ratio necessary to achieve a specified measurement precision for neutron star
radius. We find that accumulating 10^6 counts in a pulse profile is sufficient
to achieve a <5% uncertainty in the neutron star radius, which is the level of
accuracy required to determine the equation of state of neutron-star matter.
Finally, we formally derive the background limits that can be tolerated in the
measurements of the various pulsation amplitudes as a function of the system
parameters.

FitzGerald and Horn [J. Math. Anal. Appl., 1977], it is well-known that there
exists a critical exponent beyond which all entrywise powers preserve positive
definiteness. Similar phase transition phenomena have also recently been shown
by Hiai (2009) to occur for monotonicity and convexity. In this paper, we
complete the characterization of all the entrywise powers below and above the

positive semidefinite matrices. We then extend the original problem by fully
classifying the positive, monotone, or convex powers in a more general setting
where additional rank constraints are imposed on the matrices. We also classify
the entrywise powers that are super/sub-additive with respect to the Loewner
ordering. Finally, we extend all the previous characterizations to matrices
with negative entries. Our analysis consequently allows us to answer a question
raised by Bhatia and Elsner (2007) regarding the smallest dimension for which
even extensions of the power functions do not preserve Loewner positivity.

redshift region of $z \in [2.0,5.0]$, the so-called ""redshift desert"", where
other dark energy probes are hard to provide useful information of the cosmic

observational data for a CODEX (COsmic Dynamics and EXo-earth experiment)-like

scheme brings the redshift upper-limit of OHD from $z_\mathrm{max}=2.3$ to
$z_\mathrm{max}\simeq 5.0$, provides more accurate constraints on different
dark energy models, and greatly changes the degeneracy direction of the
parameters. For the $\Lambda$CDM case, the accuracy of $\Omega_m$ is improved
by $58\%$ and the degeneracy between $\Omega_m$ and $\Omega_ {\Lambda}$ is
rotated to the vertical direction of $\Omega_k = 0$ line strongly; for the

the field equation of the the TEGR, for the stress-energy-momentum tensor of
the gravitational field, whose spatial components naturally lead to the
definition of gravitational pressure, to compute the total space-time pressure,
due to the gravitational and matter fields, over a spherical, space-like
two-surface of a Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe, for any curvature
index. In particular, for a spatially flat FRW universe in the actual era
(i.e., for ""cold matter""), it resulted that the pressure (now due only to the
gravitational field) is outwardly directed over any spherical, spatial
two-surface. This surface can be, in particular, the apparent horizon of a
spatially flat FRW universe (in this case, the apparent horizon coincides with
the Hubble horizon). Assuming the validity of the first law of thermodynamics
for matter and gravity, and taking into account the contribution of the
gravitational field to both the energy and the pressure terms in the first law
of the (gravitational) thermodynamics, as well as considering the thermal
character of the apparent horizon of the spatially flat FRW universe, we have
thus obtained a value of the gravitational pressure that is very close to the
observed value. We interpret this result as a possibility that the accelerated
expansion of the actual universe might be due to the effect of the pressure of
the very gravitational field, instead of an totally unkown (dark) energy.

letters in common. Let $u,v$ be two sequences. We say that $u$ is $v$-free, if
$u$ does not contain a subsequence isomorphic to $v$. Suppose there are only
$k$ letters appearing in $v$. The extremal function Ex$(v,n)$ is defined as the
maximum length of all the $v$-free and $k$-sparse sequences. In this paper, we
study a generalization of the extremal function Ex$(v,n)$.

restrictions on nonparametric functions. Our framework includes many
nonparametric testing problems in a unified framework, with a number of
possible applications in auction models, game theoretic models, wage
inequality, and revealed preferences. Our test involves a one-sided version of
$L_{p}$ functionals of kernel-type estimators $(1\leq p <\infty )$ and is easy
to implement in general, mainly due to its recourse to the bootstrap method.
The bootstrap procedure is based on nonparametric bootstrap applied to
kernel-based test statistics, with estimated ""contact sets."" We provide
regularity conditions under which the bootstrap test is asymptotically valid
uniformly over a large class of distributions, including the cases that the
limiting distribution of the test statistic is degenerate. Our bootstrap test
is shown to exhibit good power properties in Monte Carlo experiments, and we
provide a general form of the local power function. As an illustration, we
consider testing implications from auction theory, provide primitive conditions
for our test, and demonstrate its usefulness by applying our test to real data.
We supplement this example with the second empirical illustration in the
context of wage inequality.

to investigate radial stellar VD $\sigma_{\rm\star r}(r)$ using the spherical
Jeans equation. While mass and VD profiles vary appreciably depending on DM
distribution and anisotropy, the pseudo-phase-space density-like combination
$\rho(r)/\sigma_{\rm\star r}^3(r)$ with total density $\rho(r)=
\rho_{\star}(r)+\rho_{\rm{DM}}(r)$ is nearly universal. In the optical region
the minus of its logarithmic slope has a mean value of
$\langle\chi\rangle\approx 1.86$--$1.90$ with a galaxy-to-galaxy rms scatter of
$\approx 0.04$--$0.06$, which is a few times smaller than that of $\rho(r)$
profiles. The scatter of $\chi$ can be increased by invoking wildly varying
anisotropies that are, however, less likely because they would produce too
large a scatter of line-of-sight VD profiles. As an independent check of this
universality we analyze stellar orbit-based dynamical models of 15 ETGs of Coma
cluster provided by J. Thomas. Coma ETGs, with $\sigma_{\star\rm{r}}(r)$
replaced by the rms velocity of stars $v_{\star\rm{rms}}(r)$ including net
rotation, exhibit a similar universality with a slope of $\chi= 1.93\pm 0.06$.

$\approx 1.9$ predicted by N-body simulations of DM halos. We argue that the
inferred universal nature of $\rho(r)/\sigma_{\rm\star r}^3(r)$ cannot be fully
explained by equilibrium alone, implying that some astrophysical factors
conspire and/or it reflects a fundamental principle in collisionless formation

Frontier Fields survey will detect distant galaxies 10-50 times fainter than

such faint, distant galaxies, however, requires that magnification maps built
from the constraints of strongly-lensed images be accurate. For models that
assume the cluster and nearby (correlated) structures are the only significant
sources of lensing, a potential source of error in these maps comes from the
fact that light rays also suffer weak deflections by uncorrelated large-scale
structure along the line-of-sight, i.e. cosmic weak lensing (CWL). To
demonstrate the magnitude of this effect, we calculate the magnification change
which results when the same cluster-lens is placed along different lines of
sight. Using a simple density profile for a cluster-lens at z~0.3-0.5 and the
power spectrum of the matter density fluctuations responsible for CWL, we show
that the typical magnifications of ~5(10) of sources at z=6-10 can differ by
~10-20(20-30)% from one line-of-sight to another. However, these fluctuations
rise to greater than order unity near critical curves, indicating that CWL
tends to make its greatest contribution to the most magnified images. We
conclude that the neglect of CWL in determining the intrinsic luminosities of
highly-magnified galaxies may introduce errors significant enough to warrant
further effort to include this contribution in cluster-lens modeling. We
suggest that methods of modeling CWL in galaxy-strong-lensing systems should be
generalized to cluster-lensing systems.

Four of the sources were also monitored at 12.2 GHz and show correlated
variations. We find the Lomb-Scargle periodogram to be the most sensitive
method to search for periodicity but possibly prone to false detections.
Periods range from 132.8 days (with 26 cycles observed) to 509 days (with 7
cycles observed). Five of the sources show arguably periodic variations, while
G331.13-0.24 shows strong periodicity in one peak, with large and variable
delays in other peaks.

  Circuits","47 pages",,,,"cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We establish a generic form of hardness amplification for the approximability
of constant-depth Boolean circuits by polynomials. Specifically, we show that
if a Boolean circuit cannot be pointwise approximated by low-degree polynomials
to within constant error in a certain one-sided sense, then an OR of disjoint
copies of that circuit cannot be pointwise approximated even with very high
error. As our main application, we show that for every sequence of degrees
$d(n)$, there is an explicit depth-three circuit $F: \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}$
of polynomial-size such that any degree-$d$ polynomial cannot pointwise
approximate $F$ to error better than
$1-\exp\left(-\tilde{\Omega}(nd^{-3/2})\right)$. As a consequence of our main
result, we obtain an $\exp\left(-\tilde{\Omega}(n^{2/5})\right)$ upper bound on
the the discrepancy of a function in AC$^0$, and an
$\exp\left(\tilde{\Omega}(n^{2/5})\right)$ lower bound on the threshold weight
of AC$^0$, improving over the previous best results of
$\exp\left(-\Omega(n^{1/3})\right)$ and $\exp\left(\Omega(n^{1/3})\right)$
respectively.
  Our techniques also yield a new lower bound of
$\Omega\left(n^{1/2}/\log^{(d-2)/2}(n)\right)$ on the approximate degree of the
AND-OR tree of depth $d$, which is tight up to polylogarithmic factors for any
constant $d$, as well as new bounds for read-once DNF formulas. In turn, these
results imply new lower bounds on the communication and circuit complexity of
these classes, and demonstrate strong limitations on existing PAC learning
algorithms.

pseudo-Hermitian and its exceptional points correspond to the classical turning
points of v. Applying time-dependent perturbation theory to H(\tau) we obtain a
perturbative series expansion for M and use it to study the phenomenon of
unidirectional invisibility. In particular, we establish the possibility of
having multimode unidirectional invisibility with wavelength-dependent
direction of invisibility and construct various physically realizable optical

the fact that the off-diagonal entries of the first Born approximation for M
determine the form of the potential. This gives rise to a perturbative inverse
scattering scheme that is particularly suitable for optical design. As a simple
application of this scheme, we construct an infinite-range unidirectionally
invisible potential.

successfully validates small experimental data samples against the hypothesis

  Processing","12 pages, 6 figures and 2 algorithms",,,,"cs.DB cs.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  As techniques for graph query processing mature, the need for optimization is
increasingly becoming an imperative. Indices are one of the key ingredients
toward efficient query processing strategies via cost-based optimization. Due
to the apparent absence of a common representation model, it is difficult to
make a focused effort toward developing access structures, metrics to evaluate
query costs, and choose alternatives. In this context, recent interests in
covering-based graph matching appears to be a promising direction of research.
In this paper, our goal is to formally introduce a new graph representation
model, called Minimum Hub Cover, and demonstrate that this representation
offers interesting strategic advantages, facilitates construction of candidate
graphs from graph fragments, and helps leverage indices in novel ways for query
optimization. However, similar to other covering problems, minimum hub cover is
NP-hard, and thus is a natural candidate for optimization. We claim that
computing the minimum hub cover leads to substantial cost reduction for graph
query processing. We present a computational characterization of minimum hub
cover based on integer programming to substantiate our claim and investigate
its computational cost on various graph types.

models with a non-universal IMF. We adopt the Kroupa IMF with the three slopes
(alpha_1, alpha_2, and alpha_3) dependent on metallicities ([Fe/H]) and
densities (rho_g) of star-forming gas clouds and thereby search for the best
IMF model that can reproduce (i) the observed steep IMF slope (alpha_2 ~ 3,
i.e., bottom-heavy) for low stellar masses (m < 1 M_sun) and (ii) the
correlation of alpha_2 with chemical properties of elliptical galaxies in a
self-consistent manner. We find that if the IMF slope alpha_2 depends both on
[Fe/H] and rho_g, then elliptical galaxies with higher [Mg/Fe] can have steeper
alpha_2 (~3) in our models. We also find that the observed positive correlation
of stellar mass-to-light ratios (M/L) with [Mg/Fe] in elliptical galaxies can
be quantitatively reproduced in our models with alpha_2 = beta[Fe/H]}+gamma log
rho_g, where beta ~ 0.5 and gamma ~ 2. We discuss whether the IMF slopes for

orbital period at the supernova was $\lesssim 10$ days. Since the mass transfer
process between the neutron star's progenitor and the companion star before the
supernova should have increased the orbital period to tens of days, a mechanism
with efficient orbit angular momentum loss and relatively small mass loss is
required to account for its current orbital period. We have calculated the
evolution of the progenitor binary systems from zero-age main-sequence to the
pre-supernova stage with different initial parameters and various mass and
angular momentum loss mechanisms. Our results show that the outflow from the
outer Langrangian point or a circumbinary disk formed during the mass transfer
phase may be qualified for this purpose. We point out that these mechanisms may
be popular in binary evolution and significantly affect the formation of
compact star binaries.

differences in community dynamics, species abundance has been coined as a
relevant feature not just regarding niche perspectives, but also according to
neutral perspectives. Here we explore a minimum probabilistic stochastic model
to evaluate the role of populations relative initial and total abundances on
species chances to outcompete each other and their persistence in time (i.e.,
unstable coexistence). The present results show that taking into account the
stochasticity in demographic properties and conservation of individuals in
closed communities (zero-sum assumption), population initial abundance can
strongly influence species chances to outcompete each other, and also influence
the period of coexistence of these species in a particular time interval.
Systems carrying capacity can have an important role in species coexistence by
exacerbating fitness inequalities and affecting the size of the period of
coexistence. This study also shows that populations initial abundances can act
as an equalizing mechanism, reducing fitness inequalities, which can favor
species coexistence and even make less fitted species to be more likely to
outcompete better fitted species, and thus to dominate ecological communities
in the absence of niche mechanisms.

multi-dimensional minimizer (Minuit). This allows a refinement of the

the construction of frequentist confidence intervals using profile likelihoods.
The agreement with the cosmological results from the Bayesian framework is
excellent, demonstrating the robustness of the Planck results to the
statistical methodology. We investigate the inclusion of neutrino masses, where
more significant differences may appear due to the non-Gaussian nature of the
posterior mass distribution. By applying the Feldman--Cousins prescription, we
again obtain results very similar to those of the Bayesian methodology.
However, the profile-likelihood analysis of the CMB combination
(Planck+WP+highL) reveals a minimum well within the unphysical negative-mass
region. We show that inclusion of the Planck CMB-lensing information
regularizes this issue, and provide a robust frequentist upper limit $M_\nu <

find that in order to determine macroscopic physical properties and their
temperature dependence in equilibrium disordered state, information about a few
specially selected microscopic states, established from geometrical
characteristics of the crystal lattice, is sufficient. These special states are
found to be independent of constitument elements as well as of temperature,
which is in contrast to the standard conception in statistical thermodyanamics
where a set of microscopic states mainly contributing to determining
macroscopic physical properties depend on temperature and constituent elements.
Validity and applicability of the theoretical ap- proach is confirmed through
prediction of macroscopic physical properties in practical alloys, compared
with prediction by full thermodynamic simulation. The present findings provide
efficient and systematic prediction of macroscopic physical properties for
equilibrium disordered states based on those for special microscopic states

$Spin$ groups due to isomorphisms $Spin(3) \simeq SU(2)$ and $Spin(6) \simeq
SU(4)$. However, the group of $n$-qubit gates $SU(2^n)$ for $n > 2$ has bigger
dimension than $Spin(3n)$. A quantum circuit with one- and two-qubit gates may
be used for construction of arbitrary unitary transformation $SU(2^n)$.
Analogously, the `$Spin(3n)$ circuits' are introduced in this work as products
of elements associated with one- and two-qubit gates with respect to the
above-mentioned isomorphisms.
  The matrix tensor product implementation of the $Spin(3n)$ group together
with relevant models by usual quantum circuits with $2n$ qubits are
investigated in such a framework. A certain resemblance with well-known sets of
non-universal quantum gates e.g., matchgates, noninteracting-fermion quantum
circuits) related with $Spin(2n)$ may be found in presented approach. Finally,
a possibility of the classical simulation of such circuits in polynomial time
is discussed.

shifting of the wave frequency (chirping). This report summarizes my personal
contribution to these topics in the fiscal year 2012. The effects of collisions
on chirping characteristics were investigated, with a one-dimensional
beam-plasma kinetic model. The long-time nonlinear evolution was systematically
categorized as damped, steady-state, periodic, chaotic and chirping. The
chirping regime was sub-categorized as periodic, chaotic, bursty, and
intermittent. Existing analytic theory was extended to account for Krook-like
collisions. Relaxation oscillations, associated with chirping bursts, were
investigated in the presence of dynamical friction and velocity-diffusion. The
period increases with decreasing drag, and weakly increases with decreasing
diffusion. A new theory gives a simple relation between the growth of
phase-space structures and that of the wave energy. When dissipation is modeled
by a linear term in the field equation, simple expressions of a single hole
growth rate and of the initial perturbation threshold are in agreement with
numerical simulations.

alpha_OX found in other quasars of comparable ultraviolet luminosity. The very
soft X-ray spectrum suggests that the quasar is accreting above the Eddington
rate, L/L_Edd = 5+15/-4, compared to L/L_Edd = 1.2+0.6/-0.5 derived from the
rest-frame ultraviolet. Super-Eddington accretion would help to reduce the
discrepancy between the age of the quasar implied by the small size of the
ionized near zone in which it sits (<10^7 years), and the characteristic
e-folding time (2.5 times 10^7 years if L/L_Edd=2). Such super-Eddington
accretion would also alleviate the challenging constraints on the seed black
hole mass provided that the quasar has been rapidly accreting throughout its
history. The remnant of an individual population III star is a plausible
progenitor if an average L/L_Edd>1.46 has been maintained over the quasar's

development by the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory for the European XFEL. The
detector will have 1 million pixels and allows analogue storage of 512 images
taken at 4.5 MHz in the detector front end. The LPD detector has 500 mm thick
silicon sensor tiles that are bump bonded to a readout ASIC. The ASICs
preamplifier provides relatively low noise at high speed which results in a
high dynamic range of 10^5 photons over an energy range of 5-20 keV. Small
scale prototypes of 32x256 pixels (LPD 2-Tile detector) and 256x256 pixels (LPD
supermodule detector) are now available for X-ray tests. The performance of
prototypes of the detector is reported for first tests under synchrotron
radiation (PETRA III at DESY) and Free-Electron-Laser radiation (LCLS at SLAC).
The initial performance of the detector in terms of signal range and noise,
radiation hardness and spatial and temporal response are reported. The main
result is that the 4.5 MHz sampling detection chain is reliably working,
including the analogue on-chip memory concept. The detector is at least
radiation hard up to 5 MGy at 12 keV. In addition the multiple gain concept has
been demonstrated over a dynamic range to 10^4 at 12 keV with a readout noise
equivalent to <1 photon rms in its most sensitive mode.

it consists of separate clouds, which is in a good agreement with the results
of near-IR observations. Using this assumption, we found that the torus
inclination angle and the hydrogen column density are 66.98^{+2.63}_{-1.34}

Compression removes redundancy and thus also provides encoding to a level. It

due to both subhalo perturbations and EOs, which have not been accounted for
together by previous studies. Finally, we project the simulated streams onto
the sky to investigate issues when interpreting gap spectra in observations. In
particular, we find that gap spectra from low signal-to-noise observations can
be biased by the orbital phase of the stream. This indicates that the study of
stream gaps will benefit greatly from high-quality data from future missions.

(IDD)-aided receiver, relying on the low-complexity probabilistic data
association (PDA) method, is addressed for turbo-coded
multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems using general M-ary modulations.
We demonstrate that the classic candidate-search-aided bit-based extrinsic
log-likelihood ratio (LLR) calculation method is not applicable to the family
of PDA-based detectors. Additionally, we reveal that, in contrast to the
interpretation in the existing literature, the output symbol probabilities of
existing PDA algorithms are not the true a posteriori probabilities (APPs) but,
rather, the normalized symbol likelihoods. Therefore, the classic relationship,
where the extrinsic LLRs are given by subtracting the a priori LLRs from the a
posteriori LLRs, does not hold for the existing PDA-based detectors. Motivated
by these revelations, we conceive a new approximate Bayesian-theorem-based
logarithmic-domain PDA (AB-Log-PDA) method and unveil the technique of
calculating bit-based extrinsic LLRs for the AB-Log-PDA, which facilitates the
employment of the AB-Log-PDA in a simplified IDD receiver structure.
Additionally, we demonstrate that we may dispense with inner iterations within
the AB-Log-PDA in the context of IDD receivers. Our complexity analysis and
numerical results recorded for Nakagami-m fading channels demonstrate that the
proposed AB-Log-PDA-based IDD scheme is capable of achieving a performance
comparable with that of the optimal maximum a posteriori (MAP)-detector-based
IDD receiver, while imposing significantly lower computational complexity in
the scenarios considered.

X-ray observations of A2744, we aim to understand the growth of the cluster and
the gas heating process through mass accretion along the surrounding filaments.
Methods: We analyzed data from two-pointed Suzaku observations of A2744 to
derive the temperature distribution out to the virial radius in three different
directions. We also performed a deprojection analysis to study radial profiles
of gas temperature, density, and entropy and compared the X-ray results with
multi-wavelength data to investigate correlations with the surface density of
galaxies and with radio relics. Results: The gas temperature was measured out
to the virial radius $r_{200}$ in the north-east region and to about
$1.5r_{200}$ in the north-west and south regions. The radial profile of the gas
temperature is rather flat and the temperature is very high (even near
$r_{200}$); it is comparable to the mean temperature of this cluster ($kT=9$
keV). These characteristics have not been reported in any other cluster. We
find a hint of temperature jump in the northeast region whose location
coincides with a large radio relic, indicating that the cluster experienced gas
heating because of merger or mass accretion onto the main cluster. The
temperature distribution is anisotropic and shows no clear positive correlation
with the galaxy density, which suggests an inhomogeneous mass structure and a
complex merger history in A2744.

theorem classifying all possible correspondences. A similar result is
established for classical observables representing quantum ones. These
correspondences turn out to be encoded in a one-parameter class and, in both
cases, the classical objects representing quantum ones result to be frame
functions. The requirements of $U(n)$ covariance and (convex) linearity play a
central r\^ole in the proof of those theorems. A new characterization of
classical observables describing quantum observables is presented, together
with a geometric description of the $C^*$-algebra structure of the set of

properties for sets of real numbers. Secondly we show that, while bisimilarity
is in general strictly finer than context equivalence, coincidence between the
two relations is attained on pure $\lambda$-terms. The resulting equality is
that induced by Levy-Longo trees, generally accepted as the finest extensional
equivalence on pure $\lambda$-terms under a lazy regime. Finally, we derive a
coinductive characterisation of context equivalence on the whole probabilistic
language, via an extension in which terms akin to distributions may appear in
redex position. Another motivation for the extension is that its operational
semantics allows us to experiment with a different congruence technique, namely
that of logical bisimilarity.

space-time $\mathbb S^4_1(1)$. First, we prove that a space-like surface lying
in the de Sitter space-time has pointwise 1-type Gauss map if and only if it
has parallel mean curvature vector. Then, we obtain the complete classification
of the quasi-minimal surfaces with 1-type Gauss map.

section in Double Parton Scattering (DPS) processes at the energies of LHC. In
our calculation we include saturation effects in the gluon distribution. For
charm production, our results confirm the prediction of a previous work in
which saturation effects were neglected, namely that at the energies of LHC
charm production in DPS processes becomes comparable with charm production in
SPS. We also estimate the production of $c\bar{c}b\bar{b}$ in DPS. Our results
indicate that at $\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV half of the total amount of bottom produced
in proton-proton collisions comes from this process.

way. For instance, a distributed storage system storing multiple replicas of
the data can serve a request from any of the multiple servers that store the
requested data, or a computational task may be performed in a compute-cluster
by any one of multiple processors. In such systems, the latency of serving the
requests may potentially be reduced by sending ""redundant requests"": a request
may be sent to more servers than needed, and it is deemed served when the
requisite number of servers complete service. Such a mechanism trades off the
possibility of faster execution of at least one copy of the request with the
increase in the delay due to an increased load on the system. Due to this
tradeoff, it is unclear when redundant requests may actually help. Several
recent works empirically evaluate the latency performance of redundant requests
in diverse settings.
  This work aims at an analytical study of the latency performance of redundant
requests, with the primary goals of characterizing under what scenarios sending
redundant requests will help (and under what scenarios they will not help), as
well as designing optimal redundant-requesting policies. We first present a
model that captures the key features of such systems. We show that when service
times are i.i.d. memoryless or ""heavier"", and when the additional copies of
already-completed jobs can be removed instantly, redundant requests reduce the
average latency. On the other hand, when service times are ""lighter"" or when
service times are memoryless and removal of jobs is not instantaneous, then not
having any redundancy in the requests is optimal under high loads. Our results
hold for arbitrary arrival processes.

robustness. Once such a measure has been established, we will be able to
compare networks, to improve existing networks and to design new networks that
are able to continue to perform well when it is subject to failures or attacks.
In this paper we survey a large amount of robustness measures on simple,
undirected and unweighted graphs, in order to offer a tool for network
administrators to evaluate and improve the robustness of their network. The
measures discussed in this paper are based on the concepts of connectivity
(including reliability polynomials), distance, betweenness and clustering. Some
other measures are notions from spectral graph theory, more precisely, they are
functions of the Laplacian eigenvalues. In addition to surveying these graph
measures, the paper also contains a discussion of their functionality as a
measure for topological network robustness.

physical field and transmitting the data to end-users. A crucial aspect of the
design of a WSN is the minimization of the overall energy consumption. Previous
researchers aim at optimizing the energy spent for the communication, while
mostly ignoring the energy cost due to sensing. Recently, it has been shown
that considering the sensing energy cost can be beneficial for further
improving the overall energy efficiency. More precisely, sparse sensing
techniques were proposed to reduce the amount of collected samples and recover
the missing data by using data statistics. While the majority of these
techniques use fixed or random sampling patterns, we propose to adaptively
learn the signal model from the measurements and use the model to schedule when
and where to sample the physical field. The proposed method requires minimal
on-board computation, no inter-node communications and still achieves appealing
reconstruction performance. With experiments on real-world datasets, we
demonstrate significant improvements over both traditional sensing schemes and
the state-of-the-art sparse sensing schemes, particularly when the measured
data is characterized by a strong intra-sensor (temporal) or inter-sensors
(spatial) correlation.

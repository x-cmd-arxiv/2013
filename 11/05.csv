Einsein frame and the corresponding actions in the Jordan frame are derived. We
found the conditions for which these potentials are able to reproduce viable
inflation according with the last cosmological data and lead to large scalar
curvature corrections which emerge only at a mass scale larger than the Planck
mass. Cosmological constant may appear or be set equal to zero in the Jordan

Moreover, polynomial corrections to General Relativity are analyzed in detail.
When de Sitter space-time emerges as an exact solution of the models, it is
necessary to use perturbative equations in the Jordan framework to study their
dynamics during the inflation. In this case, we demonstrate that the Ricci
scalar decreases after a correct amount of inflation, making the models
consistent with the observable evolution of the universe.

projector techniques for the construction of symmetry--adapted polynomials in

description of the mathematical structure of the latter. The present article
extends its use to the construction of polynomial bases which span possibly,
non--totally symmetric irreducible representations of a molecular symmetry
group. Electric or magnetic observables can carry such irreducible
representations, a common example is given by the electric dipole moment
surface. The elementary generating functions and their corresponding integrity
bases, where both the initial and the final representations are irreducible,
are the building blocks of the algorithm presented in this article, which is
faster than algorithms based on projection operators only. The generating
functions for the full initial representation of interest are built recursively
from the elementary generating functions. Integrity bases which can be used to
generate in the most economical way symmetry--adapted polynomial bases are
constructed alongside in the same fashion. The method is illustrated in detail
on XY4 type of molecules. Explicit integrity bases for all five possible final
irreducible representations of the tetrahedral group have been calculated and

quality of a pairwise comparison matrix. It is expected that serious
contradictions in the matrix imply high inconsistency and vice versa. However,
in the 35-year history of the applications of pairwise comparison matrices,
only one of the indices, namely CR proposed by Saaty, has been associated to a
general level of acceptance, by the well known ten percent rule. In the paper,
we consider a wide class of inconsistency indices, including CR, CM proposed by
Koczkodaj and Duszak and CI by Pel\'aez and Lamata. Assume that a threshold of
acceptable inconsistency is given (for CR it can be 0.1). The aim is to find
the minimal number of matrix elements, the appropriate modification of which
makes the matrix acceptable. On the other hand, given the maximal number of
modifiable matrix elements, the aim is to find the minimal level of
inconsistency that can be achieved. In both cases the solution is derived from
a nonlinear mixed-integer optimization problem. Results are applicable in
decision support systems that allow real time interaction with the decision

drawing, graph encoding and visibility representations for the last decades. We
study a far-reaching generalization of canonical orderings to non-planar graphs
that was published by Lee Mondshein in a PhD-thesis at M.I.T. as early as 1971.
  Mondshein proposed to order the vertices of a graph in a sequence such that,
for any i, the vertices from 1 to i induce essentially a 2-connected graph
while the remaining vertices from i+1 to n induce a connected graph.
Mondshein's sequence generalizes canonical orderings and became later and
independently known under the name non-separating ear decomposition.
Surprisingly, this fundamental link between canonical orderings and
non-separating ear decomposition has not been established before. Currently,
the fastest known algorithm for computing a Mondshein sequence achieves a
running time of O(nm); the main open problem in Mondshein's and follow-up work
is to improve this running time to subquadratic time.
  After putting Mondshein's work into context, we present an algorithm that
computes a Mondshein sequence in optimal time and space O(m). This improves the
previous best running time by a factor of n. We illustrate the impact of this
result by deducing linear-time algorithms for five other problems, for four out
of which the previous best running times have been quadratic. In particular, we
show how to - compute three independent spanning trees of a 3-connected graph
in time O(m), - improve the preprocessing time from O(n^2) to O(m) for a data
structure reporting 3 internally disjoint paths between any given vertex pair,
- derive a very simple O(n)-time planarity test once a Mondshein sequence has
been computed, - compute a nested family of contractible subgraphs of
3-connected graphs in time O(m), - compute a 3-partition in time O(m).

simplistic, and the intent is to simply obtain some general insights to inform

civilisation and its host planet as symbiotic, where the the relationship
between the symbiont and the host species (the civilisation and the planets
ecology, respectively) determines the fitness and ultimate survival of both
organisms.
  We perform a series of Monte Carlo Realisation simulations, where
civilisations pursue a variety of different relationships/strategies with their
host planet, from mutualism to parasitism, and can consequently 'infect' other
planets/hosts. We find that parasitic civilisations are generally less
effective at survival than mutualist civilisations, provided that interstellar
colonisation is inefficient (the maximum velocity of colonisation/infection is
low). However, as the colonisation velocity is increased, the strategy of
parasitism becomes more successful, until they dominate the 'population'. This
is in accordance with predictions based on island biogeography and r/K
selection theory. While heavily assumption dependent, we contend that this
provides a fertile approach for further application of insights from
theoretical ecology for extraterrestrial colonisation - while also potentially
offering insights for understanding the human-Earth relationship and the

field) can be equivalent to the non-commutative effect of the momentum sector
of the phase space when one maintains only the first order of the
non-commutative parameters. This is performed through two approaches. In one
approach, by employing the Feynman proof, the existence of a Lorentz-like force
in the gravitoelectromagnetism is indicated. The appearance of such a force is
subjected to the slow motion and the weak field approximations for stationary
fields. The analogy between this Lorentz-like force and the motion equation of
a test particle in a non-commutative space leads to the mentioned equivalency.
In fact, this equivalency is achieved by the comparison of the two motion
equations. In the other and quietly independent approach, we demonstrate that a
gravitomagnetic background can be treated as a Dirac constraint. That is, the
gravitoelectromagnetic field can be regarded as a constrained system from the
sense of the Dirac theory. Indeed, the application of the Dirac formalism for
the gravitoelectromagnetic field reveals that the phase space coordinates have
non-commutative structure from the view of the Dirac bracket. Particularly, the
gravitomagnetic field as a weak field induces the non-trivial Dirac bracket of
the momentum sector which displays the non-commutativity.

fractionalized insulators with the property that both their boundary with the
vacuum and their boundary with a topological insulator can be fully gapped
without breaking time reversal or charge conservation symmetry. This result
leads us to an apparent paradox: we consider a geometry in which a disk-like
region made up of a topological insulator is surrounded by an annular strip of
a fractionalized insulator, which is in turn surrounded by the vacuum. If we
gap both boundaries of the strip, we naively obtain an example of a gapped
interface between a topological insulator and the vacuum that does not break
any symmetries -- an impossibility. The resolution of this paradox is that this
system spontaneously breaks time reversal symmetry in an unusual way, which we
call \emph{weak symmetry breaking}. In particular, we find that the only order
parameters that are sensitive to the symmetry breaking are nonlocal operators
that describe quasiparticle tunneling processes between the two edges of the
strip; expectation values of local order parameters vanish exponentially in the
limit of a wide strip. Also, we find that the symmetry breaking in our system
comes with a ground state degeneracy, but this ground state degeneracy is
topologically protected, rather than symmetry protected. We show that this kind
of symmetry breaking can also occur at the edge of 2D fractional topological
insulators.

numerical programs with linear assignments and conditionals. Whereas abstract
interpretation techniques typically over-approximate the set of reachable
states iteratively, abstract acceleration captures the effect of the loop with
a single, non-iterative transfer function applied to the initial states at the
loop head. In contrast to previous acceleration techniques, our approach
applies to any linear loop without restrictions. Its novelty lies in the use of
the Jordan normal form decomposition of the loop body to derive symbolic
expressions for the entries of the matrix modeling the effect of n>=0
iterations of the loop. The entries of such a matrix depend on $n$ through
complex polynomial, exponential and trigonometric functions. Therefore, we
introduces an abstract domain for matrices that captures the linear inequality
relations between these complex expressions. This results in an abstract matrix
for describing the fixpoint semantics of the loop.
  Our approach integrates smoothly into standard abstract interpreters and can
handle programs with nested loops and loops containing conditional branches. We
evaluate it over small but complex loops that are commonly found in control
software, comparing it with other tools for computing linear loop invariants.
The loops in our benchmarks typically exhibit polynomial, exponential and
oscillatory behaviors that present challenges to existing approaches. Our
approach finds non-trivial invariants to prove useful bounds on the values of
variables for such loops, clearly outperforming the existing approaches in
terms of precision while exhibiting good performance.

methanol, are common observational phenomena associated with massive star
forming regions. In particular, the methanol maser appears as an ideal tool to
study the early phases of massive star formation. However, it is difficult to
establish the exact start of the methanol maser phase, and it would then be
interesting to detect and study low-flux density methanol masers (i.e., < 0.1
Jy or even << 0.1 Jy), in order to determine if they can effectively be used to
mark a specific evolutionary phase in high-mass star formation. Past surveys
have been unable to systematically detect many low-flux density methanol
masers, and thus we do not yet know how many such masers exist in the Galaxy
and what is their physical nature. Out of a sample of 107 observed Hi-GAL
sources we detected a total of 32 methanol masers, with 22 sources being new
and weak (median peak flux density 0.07 Jy) detections, in the Galactic
longitude range [32.0, 59.8]deg. We also detected 12 6.035-GHz OH maser, with 9
objects being new detections. Our survey covers a similar range of source
distances as the ""Arecibo Methanol Maser Galactic Plane Survey"", but the
methanol masers detected by us are clearly shifted towards lower integrated
flux densities. The newly detected methanol masers are mostly of low-luminosity
and, except for some sources, their weakness is not due to distance effects or
positional offsets. No specific correlation is found with the physical
parameters of the Hi-GAL clumps, except for sources with both CH3OH and OH
masers which tend to have higher mass and luminosity. The intensity of the
methanol masers correlates well with the velocity range of the maser emission,
which suggests that the low brightness of these masers is related to the number
of maser spots in the emitting region and their evolution with time.

in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The principal correlation structures of
interest are a broad jet-related peak at small relative azimuth ($\phi$)
extending to large relative pseudorapidity ($\eta$), the dijet ridge at large
relative azimuth, and an independent double ridge on $\phi$ represented by a
quadrupole function. The broad peak at small relative azimuth has been
attributed, in large part, to initial-state fluctuations and hydrodynamic flow
which produce higher-order harmonics on $\phi$. That conjecture is challenged
in this paper. It is shown that the net effect of additional higher harmonic
model elements is to describe small, non-Gaussian (NG) shapes in the broad
jet-related peak. The quadrupole correlation, which is also conventionally
attributed to hydrodynamic flow, is considered within the Balitsky - Fadin -
Kuraev - Lipatov (BFKL) Pomeron framework. Preliminary results using this model

captured by standard receptive field models. Using nonlinear Radial Basis
Function kernels in a support vector machine, we can explain the responses of
some of these cells better than standard linear and phase-invariant complex
cell models. This suggests that V1 neurons exhibit more complex and diverse
responses than standard models can capture, ranging from simple and complex

of a heavy condensation gives rise to a dynamical rearrangement of the coronal
pressure that results in the formation of a large pressure gradient that
opposes gravity. Eventually this pressure gradient becomes so large that the
blob acceleration vanishes or even points upwards. Then, the blob descent is
characterised by an initial acceleration phase followed by an essentially
constant velocity phase. These two stages can be identified in published
time-distance diagrams of coronal rain events. Both the duration of the first
stage and the velocity attained by the blob increase for larger values of the
ratio of blob to coronal density, for larger blob mass, and for smaller coronal
temperature. Dense blobs are characterised by a detectable density growth (up
to 60% in our calculations) and by a steepening of the density in their lower
part, that could lead to the formation of a shock. They also emit sound waves
that could be detected as small intensity changes with periods of the order of
100 s and lasting between a few and about ten periods. Finally, the curvature
of the falling path is only relevant when a very dense blob falls along
inclined magnetic field lines.

functions of dark matter and galaxy overdensities can be obtained, both in real
and redshift space, thanks to the symmetries enjoyed by the Newtonian equations
of motion describing the dark matter and galaxy fluids coupled through gravity.
We study the implications of such symmetries for the theory of galaxy bias and
for the theories of modified gravity. We find that the invariance of the fluid
equations under a coordinate transformation that induces a long-wavelength
velocity constrain the bias to depend only on a set of invariants, while the
symmetry of such equations under Lifshitz scalings in the case of matter
domination allows one to compute the time-dependence of the coefficients in the
bias expansion. We also find that in theories of modified gravity which violate
the equivalence principle induce a violation of the consistency relation which
may be a signature for their observation. Thus, given adiabatic Gaussian
initial conditions, the observation of a deviation from the consistency
relation for galaxies would signal a break-down of the so-called non-local
Eulerian bias model or the violation of the equivalence principle in the
underlying theory of gravity.

CSMA/ECA significantly reduces the collision probability and, under certain

after successful transmissions. This deterministic backoff is a constant and is
the same for all the stations.

homeomorphisms of a compact Hausdorff space $X$ gives rise to an action
$\theta$ of a countably generated, free abelian monoid $P$. For such a triple
$(X,P,\theta)$, which we call an irreversible $*$-commutative dynamical system,
we construct a universal $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal{O}[X,P,\theta]$. Within this
setting we show that the following four conditions are equivalent:
$(X,P,\theta)$ is topologically free, $C(X) \subset \mathcal{O}[X,P,\theta]$
has the ideal intersection property, the natural representation of
$\mathcal{O}[X,P,\theta]$ on $\ell^2(X)$ is faithful, and $C(X)$ is a masa in

$\mathcal{O}[X,P,\theta]$ is isomorphic to the Cuntz-Nica-Pimsner algebra of a
product system of Hilbert bimodules naturally associated to $(X,P,\theta)$.
Moreover, we find a close connection between $*$-commutativity and independence

the observation that, for commutative irreversible algebraic dynamical systems
of finite type $(G,P,\theta)$, the dual model $(\hat{G},P,\hat{\theta})$ is an
irreversible $*$-commutative dynamical system and
$\mathcal{O}[\hat{G},P,\hat{\theta}]$ is canonically isomorphic to

interacting non-Abelian anyons form a regular array. The studies are carried
out in the context of Kitaev's honeycomb model, where we consider three
distinct types of perturbations in the presence of a lattice of Majorana mode
binding vortices -- spatial anisotropy of the vortices, dimerization of the
vortex lattice and local random disorder. While all the nucleated phases are
stable with respect to weak perturbations of each kind, strong perturbations
are found to result in very different behavior. Anisotropy of the vortices
stabilizes the strong-pairing like phases, while dimerization can recover the
underlying non-Abelian phase. Local random disorder, on the other hand, can
drive all the nucleated phases into a gapless thermal metal state. We show that
all these distinct behavior can be captured by an effective staggered
tight-binding model for the Majorana modes. By studying the pairwise
interactions between the vortices, i.e. the amplitudes for the Majorana modes
to tunnel between vortex cores, the locations of phase transitions and the
nature of the resulting states can be predicted. We also find that due to
oscillations in the Majorana tunneling amplitude, lattices of Majorana modes
may exhibit a Peierls-like instability, where a dimerized configuration is
favored over a uniform lattice. As the nature of the nucleated phases depends
only on the Majorana tunneling, our results apply also to other system
supporting localized Majorana mode arrays, such as Abrikosov lattices in p-wave
superconductors, Wigner crystals in Moore-Read fractional quantum Hall states
or arrays of topological nanowires.

  case for heterogeneity",,,,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The well-known 3V architectural paradigm for Big Data introduced by Laney
(2011), provides a simplified framework for defining the architecture of a big
data platform to be deployed in various scenarios tackling processing of
massive datasets. While additional components such as Variability and Veracity
have been discussed as an extension to the 3V model, the basic components
(volume, variety, velocity) provide a quantitative framework while variability
and veracity target a more qualitative approach. In this paper we argue why the
basic 3V's are not equal due to the different requirements that need to be
covered in case higher demands for a particular ""V"". Similar to other
conjectures such as the CAP theorem 3V based architectures differ on their
implementation. We call this paradigm heterogeneity and we provide a taxonomy
of the existing tools (as of 2013) covering the Hadoop ecosystem from the
perspective of heterogeneity. This paper contributes on the understanding of
the Hadoop ecosystem from the perspective of different workloads and aims to
help researchers and practitioners on the design of scalable platforms
targeting different operational needs.

to prostate biopsies was designed to overcome the limitations of current
classical teaching methods. The aim of this study was to validate reliability,
face, content and construct of the simulator. Materials and methods: The
simulator is composed of a) a laptop computer, b) a haptic device with a stylus
that mimics the ultrasound probe, c) a clinical case database including three
dimensional (3D) ultrasound volumes and patient data and d) a learning
environment with a set of progressive exercises including a randomized 12-core
biopsy procedure. Both visual (3D biopsy mapping) and numerical (score)
feedback are given to the user. The simulator evaluation was conducted in an
academic urology department on 7 experts and 14 novices who each performed a
virtual biopsy procedure and completed a face and content validity
questionnaire. Results: The overall realism of the biopsy procedure was rated
at a median of 9/10 by non-experts (7.1-9.8). Experts rated the usefulness of
the simulator for the initial training of urologists at 8.2/10 (7.9-8.3), but
reported the range of motion and force feedback as significantly less realistic
than novices (p=0.01 and 0.03 respectively). Pearson's r correlation
coefficient between correctly placed biopsies on the right and left side of the
prostate for each user was 0.79 (p<0.001). The 7 experts had a median score of
64% (59-73), and the 14 novices a median score of 52% (43-67), without reaching
statistical significance (p=0,19). Conclusion: The newly designed virtual
reality learning environment proved its versatility and its reliability, face
and content were validated. Demonstrating the construct validity will require
improvements to the realism and scoring system used.

Non-axisymmetric magnetic perturbations are added by external coils, similar to
the correction coils installed at the tokamak DIII-D and those that will be
installed at ITER. To show the influence of magnetic perturbations on the field
line escape, we integrate numerically the field line differential equations and
obtain the footprints and deposition patterns on the divertor plate. Moreover,
we show that the homoclinic tangle describes the deposition patterns in the
divertor plate, agreeing with results observed in sophisticated simulation
codes. Additionally, we show that while chaotic lines escape to the divertor
plates, some of them are trapped, for many toroidal turns, in complex
structures around magnetic islands, embedded in the chaotic region, giving rise
to the so called stickiness effect characteristic of chaotic Hamiltonian
systems. Finally, we introduce a random collisional term to the field line
mapping to investigate stickiness alterations due to particle collisions.
Within this model, we conclude that, even reduced by collisions, stickiness
still influences the field line transport.

a finite range. This condensation phenomenon is well illustrated by the
Deffuant-Weisbuch opinion model for which we provide a natural extension to
allow for spatial heterogeneities. We show analytically and numerically that
the resulting dynamics of the emergent field is a noisy diffusion equation that
has a slow dynamics. This random diffusion equation reproduces the long-ranged,
logarithmic decrease of the correlation of spatial voting patterns empirically
found in [1, 2]. Interestingly enough, we find that when the social cohesion
mechanism becomes too weak, cultural cohesion breaks down completely, in the
sense that the distribution of intentions/opinions becomes infinitely broad. No
emerging field exists in this case. All these analytical findings are confirmed
by numerical simulations of an agent-based model.

high-quality single crystals in pulsed high magnetic fields up to 81~T at a
temperature of 1.4~K and up to 60~T at temperatures down to 100~mK. For a field
\textbf{H} applied along the magnetic easy-axis \textbf{c}, a strong
sample-dependence of the low-temperature resistivity in the hidden-order phase
is attributed to a high carrier mobility. The interplay between the magnetic
and orbital properties is emphasized by the angle-dependence of the phase
diagram, where magnetic transition fields and crossover fields related to the
Fermi surface properties follow a 1/$\cos\theta$-law, $\theta$ being the angle
between \textbf{H} and \textbf{c}. For $\mathbf{H}\parallel\mathbf{c}$, a
crossover defined at a kink of $\rho_{x,x}$, as initially reported in [Shishido
et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{102}, 156403 (2009)], is found to be strongly
sample-dependent: its characteristic field $\mu_0H^*$ varies from $\simeq20$~T
in our best sample with a residual resistivity ratio RRR of $225$ to
$\simeq25$~T in a sample with a RRR of $90$. A second crossover is defined at
the maximum of $\rho_{x,x}$ at the sample-independent characteristic field
$\mu_0H_{\rho,max}^{LT}\simeq30$~T. Fourier analyzes of SdH oscillations show
that $H_{\rho,max}^{LT}$ coincides with a sudden modification of the Fermi
surface, while $H^*$ lies in a regime where the Fermi surface is smoothly
modified. For $\mathbf{H}\parallel\mathbf{a}$, i) no phase transition is
observed at low temperature and the system remains in the hidden-order phase up
to 81~T, ii) quantum oscillations surviving up to 7~K are related to a new and
almost-spherical orbit - for the first time observed here - at the frequency
$F_\lambda\simeq1400$~T and associated with a low effective mass
$m^*_\lambda=(1\pm0.5)\cdot m_0$, and iii) no Fermi surface modification occurs

recover Boltzmann's formula by maximizing entropy subject to a constraint on
the expected energy. This raises the question: what is the quantum mechanical

""quantropy"". We recover Feynman's formula from assuming that histories have
complex amplitudes, that these amplitudes sum to one, and that the amplitudes
give a stationary point of quantropy subject to a constraint on the expected
action. Alternatively, we can assume the amplitudes sum to one and that they
give a stationary point of a quantity we call ""free action"", which is analogous
to free energy in statistical mechanics. We compute the quantropy, expected
action and free action for a free particle, and draw some conclusions from the
results.

we carried out two sets of simulations including radiative cooling, star
formation, metal enrichment and feedback from supernovae, one of which also
accounts for the effect of feedback from AGN resulting from gas accretion onto
super-massive black holes. These simulations are analysed with the aim of
studying the relative role played by SN and AGN feedback on the general
properties of the diffuse hot baryons in galaxy clusters and groups: scaling
relations, temperature, entropy and pressure radial profiles, and ICM chemical
enrichment. We find that simulations including AGN feedback produce scaling
relations that are in good agreement with X-ray observations at all mass
scales. However, our simulations are not able to account for the observed
diversity between CC and NCC clusters: unlike for observations, we find that
temperature and entropy profiles of relaxed and unrelaxed clusters are quite
similar and resemble more the observed behaviour of NCC clusters. As for the
pattern of metal enrichment, we find that an enhanced level of iron abundance
is produced by AGN feedback with respect to the case of purely SN feedback. As
a result, while simulations including AGN produce values of iron abundance in
groups in agreement with observations, they over-enrich the ICM in massive
clusters. The efficiency of AGN feedback in displacing enriched gas from halos
into the inter-galactic medium at high redshift also creates a widespread
enrichment in the outskirts of clusters and produces profiles of iron abundance
whose slope is in better agreement with observations.

conjugate-Franson interferometers -- that probe photon-pair frequency
correlations and arrival-time correlations. From these measurements an upper
bound can be established on the eavesdropper's Holevo information by
translating the Gaussian-state security analysis for continuous-variable
quantum key distribution so that it applies to our protocol. We show that
visibility data from just the Franson interferometer provides a weaker, but
nonetheless useful, secure-key rate lower bound. To handle multiple-pair
emissions, we incorporate the decoy-state approach into our protocol. Our
results show that over 200\,km transmission distance in optical fiber,
time-energy entanglement HDQKD could permit a 700 bit/sec secure-key rate, and
a photon information efficiency of 2 secure-key bits per photon coincidence in
the key-generation phase using receivers with 15% system efficiency.

obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 on 2013 April 10.
C/ISON's coma brightness follows a 1/{\rho} (where {\rho} is the projected
distance from the nucleus) profile out to 5000 km, consistent with a constant
speed dust outflow model. The turnaround distance in the sunward direction
suggests that the dust coma is composed of sub-micron-sized particles emitted
at speeds of tens of meters s$^{-1}$. A({\theta})f{\rho}, which is commonly
used to characterize the dust production rate, was 1340 and 1240 cm in the
F606W and F438W filters, respectively, in apertures <1.6"" in radius. The dust
colors are slightly redder than solar, with a slope of 5.0$\pm$0.2% per 100 nm,
increasing to >10% per 100 nm 10,000 km down the tail. The colors are similar
to those of comet C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp) and other long-period comets, but
somewhat bluer than typical values for short-period comets. The spatial color
variations are also reminiscent of C/Hale-Bopp. A sunward jet is visible in
enhanced images, curving to the north and then tailward in the outer coma. The
1.6""-long jet is centered at a position angle of 291$^\circ$, with an opening
angle of about 45$^\circ$. The jet morphology remains unchanged over 19 hours
of our observations, suggesting that it is near the rotational pole of the
nucleus, and implying that the pole points to within 30 deg of (RA, Dec) =
(330$^\circ$, 0$^\circ$). This pole orientation indicates a high obliquity of
50$^\circ$-80$^\circ$.

Uncertainties in the computed statistics arise from two sources: finite
statistical sampling and the discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations. Due
to the presence of non-trivial sampling error, standard techniques for
estimating discretization error (such as Richardson extrapolation) fail or are
unreliable. This work provides a systematic and unified approach for estimating
these errors. First, a sampling error estimator that accounts for correlation
in the input data is developed. Then, this sampling error estimate is used as
part of a Bayesian extension of Richardson extrapolation in order to
characterize the discretization error. These methods are tested using the
Lorenz equations and are shown to perform well. These techniques are then used
to investigate the sampling and discretization errors in the DNS of a
wall-bounded turbulent flow. For both cases, it is found that while the
sampling uncertainty is large enough to make the order of accuracy difficult to
determine, the estimated discretization errors are quite small. This indicates
that the commonly used heuristics provide ad- equate resolution for this class
of problems. However, it is also found that, for some quantities, the
discretization error is not small relative to sampling error, indicating that
the conventional wisdom that sampling error dominates discretization error for
this class of simulations needs to be reevaluated.

investigate the correlation between the scattered light and the dust column
density. The medium is modeled using fractional Brownian motion structures that
are appropriate for turbulent ISM. The correlation plot between the scattered
light and optical depth shows substantial scatter and deviation from simple
proportionality. It was also found that the overall density contrast is
smoothed out in scattered light. In other words, there is an enhancement of the
dust-scattered flux in low-density regions, while the scattered flux is
suppressed in high-density regions. The correlation becomes less significant as
the scattering becomes closer to be isotropic and the medium becomes more
turbulent. Therefore, the scattered light observed in near-infrared wavelengths
would show much weaker correlation than the observations in optical and
ultraviolet wavelengths. We also find that the correlation plot between
scattered lights at two different wavelengths shows a tighter correlation than
that of the scattered light versus the optical depth.

linear observations $y = Ax_0 + z\in R^m$. In many practical instances, $x_0$
has a certain structure that can be captured by a structure inducing convex
function $f(\cdot)$. For example, $\ell_1$ norm can be used to encourage a
sparse solution. To estimate $x_0$ with the aid of $f(\cdot)$, we consider the
well-known LASSO method and provide sharp characterization of its performance.
We assume the entries of the measurement matrix $A$ and the noise vector $z$
have zero-mean normal distributions with variances $1$ and $\sigma^2$
respectively. For the LASSO estimator $x^*$, we attempt to calculate the
Normalized Square Error (NSE) defined as $\frac{\|x^*-x_0\|_2^2}{\sigma^2}$ as
a function of the noise level $\sigma$, the number of observations $m$ and the
structure of the signal. We show that, the structure of the signal $x_0$ and
choice of the function $f(\cdot)$ enter the error formulae through the summary
parameters $D(cone)$ and $D(\lambda)$, which are defined as the Gaussian
squared-distances to the subdifferential cone and to the $\lambda$-scaled
subdifferential, respectively. The first LASSO estimator assumes a-priori
knowledge of $f(x_0)$ and is given by $\arg\min_{x}\{{\|y-Ax\|_2}~\text{subject
to}~f(x)\leq f(x_0)\}$. We prove that its worst case NSE is achieved when
$\sigma\rightarrow 0$ and concentrates around $\frac{D(cone)}{m-D(cone)}$.
Secondly, we consider $\arg\min_{x}\{\|y-Ax\|_2+\lambda f(x)\}$, for some
$\lambda\geq 0$. This time the NSE formula depends on the choice of $\lambda$
and is given by $\frac{D(\lambda)}{m-D(\lambda)}$. We then establish a mapping
between this and the third estimator $\arg\min_{x}\{\frac{1}{2}\|y-Ax\|_2^2+
\lambda f(x)\}$. Finally, for a number of important structured signal classes,
we translate our abstract formulae to closed-form upper bounds on the NSE.

hadronic reactions of the pre-QCD era with the perturbative BFKL approach. The
specific version we will use due to Stoffers and Zahed, is based on a
semiclassical quantization of a ""tube"" (closed string exchange or open string
virtual pair production) in its Euclidean formulation using the scalar Polyakov
action. This model has a number of phenomenologically successful results. The
periodicity of a coordinate around the tube allows the introduction of a
Matsubara time and therefore an effective temperature Teff on the string. We
observe that at the LHC energies and for sufficiently small impact parameter,
Teff approaches and even exceeds the Hagedorn temperature of the QCD strings.
Based on studies of the stringy thermodynamics of pure gauge theories we
suggest that there should exist two new regimes of the Pomeron: the
""near-critical"" and the ""post-critical"" ones. In the former one, string
excitations create a high entropy ""string ball"", with high energy and entropy
but small pressure/free energy. If heavy enough this ball becomes a (dual)
black hole (BH). As the intrinsic temperature of the string exceeds the
Hagedorn temperature, the ball becomes a post-critical explosive ""QGP ball"".
The hydrodynamical explosion resulting from this scenario was predicted by us
to have radial flow exceeding that ever seen even in heavy ion collisions,
which was recently confirmed by CMS and ALICE at LHC. We also discuss the
elastic scattering profile, finding some hints for new phases in it, as well as
two-particle correlations.

star-formation rates. A major puzzle is why any given galaxy is star-forming or
quiescent, and a wide range of physical mechanisms have been proposed as
solutions. We consider how observations, such as might be available in upcoming
large galaxy surveys, might distinguish different galaxy quenching scenarios.
To do this, we combine an N-body simulation and multiple prescriptions from the
literature to create several quiescent galaxy mock catalogues. Each
prescription uses a different set of galaxy properties (such as history,
environment, centrality) to assign individual simulation galaxies as quiescent.
We find how and how much the resulting quiescent galaxy distributions differ
from each other, both intrinsically and observationally. In addition to tracing
observational consequences of different quenching mechanisms, our results
indicate which sorts of quenching models might be most readily disentangled by
upcoming observations and which combinations of observational quantities might
provide the most discriminatory power.
  Our observational measures are auto, cross, and marked correlation functions,
pro- jected density distributions, and group multiplicity functions, which rely
upon galaxy positions, stellar masses and of course quiescence. Although
degeneracies between models are present for individual observations, using
multiple observations in concert allows us to distinguish between all ten
models we consider. In addition to identifying intrinsic and observational
consequences of quiescence prescriptions and testing these quiescence models
against each other and observations, these methods can also be used to validate
colors (or other history and environment dependent properties) in simulated
mock catalogues.

Survey (SDSS-DR9). The aims of this study are to refine the photometric-based
AMIGA sample of isolated galaxies and to provide an improvement of the
quantification of the isolation degree with respect to previous works, using
both photometry and spectroscopy. We developed an automatic method to search
for neighbours within a projected area of 1 Mpc radius centred on each primary
galaxy to revise the CIG isolation criteria. Of the 636 CIG galaxies considered
in the photometric study, 426 galaxies fulfil the CIG isolation criteria within
1 Mpc, taking into account projected neighbours. Of the 411 CIG galaxies
considered in the spectroscopic study, 347 galaxies fulfil the CIG isolation
criteria when a criterion about redshift difference is added. The available
redshifts allow us to reject background neighbours and thus improve the
photometric assessment. For the first time, the environment and the isolation
degree of AMIGA galaxies are quantified using digital data. The use of the SDSS
database permits one to identify fainter and smaller-size satellites than in
previous AMIGA works. About 50% of the neighbours considered as potential
companions in the photometric study are in fact background objects. We also
find that about 92% of the neighbour galaxies that show recession velocities
similar to the corresponding CIG galaxy are not considered by the CIG isolation
criteria as potential companions, which may have a considerable influence on
the evolution of the central CIG galaxy.

We compute the bias between the spatial distribution of dark matter haloes and
the overall matter and cold dark matter distributions using statistical tools
such as the power spectrum and the two-point correlation function. Overall we
find a scale-dependent bias on large scales for the cosmologies with massive
neutrinos. However, our results indicate that the scale-dependence in the bias
is reduced if the latter is computed with respect to the cold dark matter
distribution only. We find that the value of the bias on large scales is
reasonably well reproduced by the Tinker fitting formula once the linear cold
dark matter power spectrum is used, instead of the total matter power spectrum.
We investigate whether scale-dependent bias really comes from purely neutrino's
effect or from nonlinear gravitational collapse of haloes. For this purpose, we
address the $\Omega_\nu$-$\sigma_8$ degeneracy and find that such degeneracy is
not perfect, implying that neutrinos imprint a slight scale dependence on the
large-scale bias. Finally, by using a simple halo occupation distribution (HOD)
model, we investigate the impact of massive neutrinos on the distribution of
galaxies within dark matter haloes. We use the main galaxy sample in the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey II Data Release 7 to investigate if the small-scale galaxy
clustering alone can be used to discriminate among different cosmological
models with different neutrino masses. Our results suggest that different
choices of the HOD parameters can reproduce the observational measurements
relatively well, and we quantify the difference between the values of the HOD
parameters between massless and massive neutrino cosmologies.

and submillimeter spectroscopy (Submillimeter Array) of the central galaxy in
the Phoenix cluster (SPT-CLJ2344-4243). This cluster was previously reported to
have a massive starburst (~800 Msun/yr) in the central, brightest cluster
galaxy, most likely fueled by the rapidly-cooling intracluster medium. These
new data reveal a complex emission-line nebula, extending for >30 kpc from the
central galaxy. The total Halpha luminosity, assuming Halpha/Hbeta = 2.85, is
L_Ha = 7.6 +/- 0.4 x10^43 erg/s, making this the most luminous emission line
nebula detected in the center of a cool core cluster. Overall, the relative
fluxes of the low-ionization lines (e.g., [O II], Hbeta) to the UV continuum
are consistent with photoionization by young stars. In both the center of the
galaxy and in a newly-discovered highly-ionized plume to the north of the
galaxy, the ionization ratios are consistent with both shocks and AGN
photoionization. We speculate that this extended plume may be a galactic wind,
driven and partially photoionized by both the starburst and central AGN. We
find evidence for shocks throughout the ISM of the central galaxy, most likely
driven by a combination of stellar winds from massive young stars,
core-collapse supernovae, and the central AGN. In addition to the warm, ionized
gas, we detect a substantial amount of cold, molecular gas via the CO(3-2)
transition, coincident in position with the galaxy center. We infer a molecular
gas mass of M_H2 = 2.2 +/- 0.6 x10^10 Msun, which implies that the starburst
will consume its fuel in ~30 Myr if it is not replenished. The combination of
the high level of turbulence in the warm phase and the high L_IR/M_H2 ratio
suggests that this violent starburst may be in the process of quenching itself.

Project (XVP) observation of the NGC~3115 supermassive black hole to place the
first direct observational constraints on the spatially and spectroscopically
resolved structures of the X-ray emitting gas inside the Bondi radius of a
black hole. We measured temperature and density profiles of the hot gas from a
fraction out to tens of the Bondi radius (R_B = 2.4-4.8 arcsec = 112-224 pc).
The projected temperature jumps significantly from ~0.3 keV beyond 5 arcsec to
~0.7 keV within ~4-5 arcsec, but then abruptly drops back to ~0.3 keV within ~3
arcsec. This is contrary to the expectation that the temperature should rise
toward the center for a radiatively inefficient accretion flow. A hotter
thermal component of ~1 keV inside 3 arcsec (~150 pc) is revealed using a two
component thermal model, with the cooler ~0.3 keV thermal component dominating
the spectra. We argue that the softer emission comes from diffuse gas
physically located within $\sim 150$~pc from the black hole. The density
profile is broadly consistent with rho ~ r^{-1} within the Bondi radius for
either the single temperature or the two-temperature model. The X-ray data
alone with physical reasoning argue against the absence of a black hole,
supporting that we are witnessing the onset of the gravitational influence of

for computing cosmological correlation functions of the curvature fluctuation,
$\zeta$. It makes explicit use of the soft breaking of time diffeomorphisms by
the inflationary background to organize the operators expansion in the action
of the Goldstone mode $\pi$ associated with this breaking. Despite its
ascendancy, there is another method for calculating $\zeta$ correlators,
involving the direct calculation of the so-called Horndeski action order by
order in powers of $\zeta$ and its derivatives. The question we address in this
work is whether or not the $\zeta$ correlators calculated in these seemingly
different ways are in fact the same. The answer is that the actions to cubic
order in either set of variables do indeed give rise to the same $\zeta$
bispectra, but that to make this equivalence manifest requires a careful
understanding of the non-linear transformations relating $\pi$ to $\zeta$ and
how boundary terms in the actions are affected by imposing this relation. As a
by product of our study we find that the calculations in the $\pi$ language can
be simplified considerably in a way that allows us to use only the linear part
of the $\pi-\zeta$ relation simply by changing the coefficients of some of the
operators in the EFT. We also note that a proper accounting of the boundary
terms will be of the greatest importance when computing the bispectrum for more
general initial states than the Bunch-Davies one.

the hydrogen recombination lines (H$\beta$, H$\alpha$ and Pa$\beta$), which we
use to investigate the dust extinction in the HII regions. We derive extinction
maps with 6 parsec spatial resolution from two combinations of hydrogen lines
(H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$/Pa$\beta$), and show that the longer
wavelengths probe larger optical depths, with $A_V$ values larger by $\gtrsim$1
mag than those derived from the shorter wavelengths. This difference leads to a
factor $\gtrsim$2 discrepancy in the extinction-corrected H$\alpha$ luminosity,
a significant effect when studying extragalactic HII regions. By comparing
these observations to a series of simple models, we conclude that a large
diversity of absorber/emitter geometric configurations can account for the
data, implying a more complex physical structure than the classical foreground
""dust screen"" assumption. However, most data points are bracketed by the
foreground screen and a model where dust and emitters are uniformly mixed. When
averaged over large ($\gtrsim$100--200 pc) scales, the extinction becomes
consistent with a ""dust screen"", suggesting that other geometries tend to be
restricted to more local scales. Moreover, the extinction in any region can be
described by a combination of the foreground screen and the uniform mixture
model with weights of 1/3 and 2/3 in the center ($\lesssim$2 kpc),
respectively, and 2/3 and 1/3 for the rest of the disk. This simple
prescription significantly improves the accuracy of the dust extinction
corrections and can be especially useful for pixel-based analyses of galaxies
similar to M83.

tidal deformabilities of neutron stars, which leads us to the understanding of
physics at nuclear density. In principle, the gravitational waveform depends on
various tidal parameters, which correlate strongly. Therefore, it would be
useful if one can express such tidal parameters with a single parameter. Here,
we report on universal relations among various $\ell$-th (dimensionless)
electric, magnetic and shape tidal deformabilities in neutron stars and quark
stars that do not depend sensitively on the equation of state. Such relations
allow us to break the degeneracy among the tidal parameters. In this paper, we
focus on gravitational waves from non-spinning neutron-star binary inspirals.
We first derive the leading contribution of the $\ell$-th electric and $\ell=2$
magnetic tidal deformabilities to the gravitational-wave phase, which enters at
$2\ell +1$ and $6$ post-Newtonian orders relative to the leading Newtonian one
respectively. We then calculate the useful number of gravitational-wave cycles
and show that not only the $\ell=2$ but also $\ell=3$ electric tidal
deformabilities are important for parameter estimation with third-generation
gravitational-wave detectors such as LIGO III and Einstein Telescope. Although
the correlation between the $\ell=2$ and $\ell=3$ electric tidal
deformabilities deteriorate the measurement accuracy of the former
deformability parameter, one can increase its measurement accuracy
significantly by using the universal relation. We provide a fitting formula for
the LIGO III noise curve in the Appendix.

Telescope and the total integration time was 41 hours distributed in 34
contiguous tiles. A survey-specific strategy was designed to account for
extended galaxies while still measuring accurate sky brightness within the
survey area. The average 5\sigma limiting magnitude is Ks=24.4 AB mag and the
50% completeness limit is Ks=23.75 AB mag for point source detections, when
using only images with better than 0.7"" seeing (median seeing 0.54""). Star
clusters are marginally resolved in these image stacks, and Virgo galaxies with
\mu_Ks=24.4 AB mag arcsec^-2 are detected. Combining the Ks data with optical
and ultraviolet data, we build the uiK color-color diagram which allows a very
clean color-based selection of globular clusters in Virgo. This diagnostic plot
will provide reliable globular cluster candidates for spectroscopic follow-up
campaigns needed to continue the exploration of Virgo's photometric and
kinematic sub-structures, and will help the design of future searches for
globular clusters in extragalactic systems. Equipped with this powerful new

a fundamental difference from standard condensates stems from the finite

maintain a steady state. A basic question is whether a two dimensional
condensate with long range algebraic correlations can exist under these

binaries (MBHBs) in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The search is based on
the peculiar properties of merging galaxies that are found in a mock galaxy
catalog from the Millennium Simulation. MBHBs are expected to be the main
gravitational wave (GW) sources for pulsar timing arrays (PTAs); however, it is
still unclear if the observed GW signal will be produced by a few single MBHBs,
or if it will have the properties of a stochastic background. The goal of this
work is to produce a map of the sky in which each galaxy is assigned a
probability of having suffered a recent merger, and of hosting a MBHB that
could be detected by PTAs. This constitutes a step forward in the understanding
of the expected PTA signal: the skymap can be used to investigate the
clustering properties of PTA sources and the spatial distribution of the
observable GW signal power; moreover, galaxies with the highest probabilities
could be used as inputs in targeted searches for individual GW sources. We also
investigate the distribution of neighboring galaxies around galaxies hosting
MBHBs, finding that the most likely detectable PTA sources are located in dense
galaxy environments. Different techniques are used in the search, including
Bayesian and Machine Learning algorithms, with consistent outputs. Our method
generates a list of galaxies classified as MBHB hosts, that can be combined
with other searches to effectively reduce the number of misclassifications. The
spectral coverage of the SDSS reaches less than a fifth of the sky, and the
catalog becomes severely incomplete at large redshifts; however, this technique
can be applied in the future to larger catalogs to obtain complete,
observationally-based information of the expected GW signal detectable by PTAs.

actively studied recently due to their simple syndrome readout circuits and
potential applications in fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, all
families of quantum LDPC codes known to this date suffer from a poor distance
scaling limited by the square-root of the code length. This is in a sharp
contrast with the classical case where good families of LDPC codes are known
that combine constant encoding rate and linear distance. Here we propose the
first family of good quantum codes with low-weight stabilizers. The new codes
have a constant encoding rate, linear distance, and stabilizers acting on at
most $\sqrt{n}$ qubits, where $n$ is the code length. For comparison, all
previously known families of good quantum codes have stabilizers of linear
weight. Our proof combines two techniques: randomized constructions of good
quantum codes and the homological product operation from algebraic topology. We
conjecture that similar methods can produce good stabilizer codes with
stabilizer weight $n^a$ for any $a>0$. Finally, we apply the homological
product to construct new small codes with low-weight stabilizers.

  cluster spatial density profile, black hole mass, and distance","7 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables, ApJL accepted",,"10.1088/2041-8205/779/1/L6",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present 3D kinematic observations of stars within the central 0.5 pc of
the Milky Way nuclear star cluster using adaptive optics imaging and
spectroscopy from the Keck telescopes. Recent observations have shown that the
cluster has a shallower surface density profile than expected for a dynamically
relaxed cusp, leading to important implications for its formation and
evolution. However, the true three dimensional profile of the cluster is
unknown due to the difficulty in de-projecting the stellar number counts. Here,
we use spherical Jeans modeling of individual proper motions and radial
velocities to constrain for the first time, the de-projected spatial density
profile, cluster velocity anisotropy, black hole mass ($M_\mathrm{BH}$), and
distance to the Galactic center ($R_0$) simultaneously. We find that the inner
stellar density profile of the late-type stars, $\rho(r)\propto r^{-\gamma}$ to
have a power law slope $\gamma=0.05_{-0.60}^{+0.29}$, much more shallow than
the frequently assumed Bahcall $\&$ Wolf slope of $\gamma=7/4$. The measured
slope will significantly affect dynamical predictions involving the cluster,
such as the dynamical friction time scale. The cluster core must be larger than
0.5 pc, which disfavors some scenarios for its origin. Our measurement of
$M_\mathrm{BH}=5.76_{-1.26}^{+1.76}\times10^6$ $M_\odot$ and
$R_0=8.92_{-0.55}^{+0.58}$ kpc is consistent with that derived from stellar
orbits within 1$^{\prime\prime}$ of Sgr A*. When combined with the orbit of
S0-2, the uncertainty on $R_0$ is reduced by 30% ($8.46_{-0.38}^{+0.42}$ kpc).
We suggest that the MW NSC can be used in the future in combination with
stellar orbits to significantly improve constraints on $R_0$.

(CCO) in the Cas A supernova remnant (SNR), we analyzed two Chandra
observations of this CCO, taken in a setup minimizing instrumental spectral
distortions. We fit the two CCO X-ray spectra from 2006 and 2012 with hydrogen
and carbon neutron star atmosphere models. The temperature and flux changes in
the 5.5 years between the two epochs depend on the adopted constraints on the
fitting parameters and the uncertainties of the effective area calibrations. If
we allow a change of the equivalent emitting region size, R_Em, the effective
temperature remains essentially the same. If R_Em is held constant, the
best-fit temperature change is negative, but its statistical significance
ranges from 0.8sigma to 2.5sigma, depending on the model. If we assume that the
optical depth of the ACIS filter contaminant in 2012 was +/-10% different from
its default calibration value, the significance of the temperature drop becomes
0.8sigma to 3.1sigma, for the carbon atmospheres with constant R_Em. Thus, we
do not see a statistically significant temperature drop in our data, but the
involved uncertainties are too large to firmly exclude the previously reported
fast cooling. Our analysis indicate a decrease of 4%-6% (1.9-2.9sigma
significance) for the absorbed flux in the energy range 0.6-6keV between 2006
and 2012, most prominent in the 1.4-1.8 keV energy range. It could be caused by
unaccounted changes of the detector response or contributions from unresolved
SNR material along the line of sight to the CCO.

patchiness, multiplicity of stable states and fronts separating domains of
alternative stable states. Pattern dynamics, induced by droughts or
disturbances, can result in desertification shifts from patterned vegetation to
bare soil. Pattern-formation theory suggests various scenarios for such
dynamics; an abrupt global shift involving a fast collapse to bare soil, a
gradual global shift involving the expansion and coalescence of bare-soil
domains, and an incipient shift to a hybrid state consisting of stationary
bare-soil domains in an otherwise periodic pattern. Using models of dryland
vegetation we address the question which of these scenarios can be realized. We
found that the models can be split into two groups: models that exhibit
multiplicity of periodic-pattern and bare-soil states, and models that exhibit,
in addition, multiplicity of hybrid states. Furthermore, in all models we could
not identify parameter regimes in which bare-soil domains expand into vegetated
domains. The significance of these findings is that while models belonging to
the first group can only exhibit abrupt shifts, model belonging to the second
group can also exhibit gradual and incipient shifts. A discussion of open
problems concludes the paper.

ribbons can undergo a transition into fully-metallic or semiconducting behavior
with application of an electric field or uniaxial strain. An external
transverse electric field induces a full charge screening that renders the
material semiconducting. In contrast, as uniaxial strain varies from
compressive to tensile, a spin-resolved selective self-doping increases the
half-metallic character of the ribbons. The relevant strain-induced changes in
electronic properties arise from band structure modifications at the Fermi
level as a consequence of a spin-polarized charge transfer between pi-orbitals
of the N and Al edge atoms in a spin-resolved self-doping process. This band
structure tunability indicates the possibility ofdesigning magnetic nanoribbons
with tunable electronic structure by deriving edge states from elements with
sufficiently different localization properties. Finite temperature molecular
dynamics reveal a thermally stable half-metallic nanoribbon up to room

of the algorithm in both real and redshift space. In the latter, our intention
is also to determine the degree of accuracy that could be achieved when using
spectroscopic or photometric redshift determinations as a distance indicator.
We have built a light-cone mock catalogue using synthetic galaxies constructed
from the Millennium Run Simulation I plus a semi-analytical model of galaxy
formation. We have explored different ways to define the proper linking length
parameters of the algorithm in order to perform an identification of galaxy
groups as suitable as possible in each case. We find that, when identifying
systems in redshift space using spectroscopic information, the linking lengths
should take into account the variation of the luminosity function with redshift
as well as the linear redshift dependence of the radial fiducial velocity in
the line of sight direction. When testing purity and completeness of the group
samples, we find that the best resulting group sample reaches values of 40% and
70% of systems with high levels of purity and completeness, respectively, when
using spectroscopic information. When identifying systems using photometric

multiplexing (WDM) PONs are promising near-term candidates. On the other hand,
next-generation wireless local area networks (WLANs) based on frame aggregation

Gigabit-class very high throughput (VHT) WLANs. In this paper, we develop an
analytical framework for evaluating the capacity and delay performance of a
wide range of routing algorithms in converged fiber-wireless (FiWi) broadband
access networks based on different next-generation PONs and a Gigabit-class
multi-radio multi-channel WLAN-mesh front-end. Our framework is very flexible
and incorporates arbitrary frame size distributions, traffic matrices,
optical/wireless propagation delays, data rates, and fiber faults. We verify
the accuracy of our probabilistic analysis by means of simulation for the
wireless and wireless-optical-wireless operation modes of various FiWi network
architectures under peer-to-peer, upstream, uniform, and nonuniform traffic
scenarios. The results indicate that our proposed optimized FiWi routing
algorithm (OFRA) outperforms minimum (wireless) hop and delay routing in terms
of throughput for balanced and unbalanced traffic loads, at the expense of a
slightly increased mean delay at small to medium traffic loads.

As data quality improves rapidly, it has been suggested that the CMB

describing cosmological structure growth. In this work we perform forecasts
that combine the lensing potential auto power spectrum from various future CMB
experiments, the galaxy power spectrum from galaxy surveys, as well as the
cross power spectrum between the two, marginalizing over a number galactic and
non-galactic cosmological parameters. We find that the CMB lensing-LSS cross

analyze a novel divide-and-conquer solver for kernel SVMs (DC-SVM). In the
division step, we partition the kernel SVM problem into smaller subproblems by
clustering the data, so that each subproblem can be solved independently and
efficiently. We show theoretically that the support vectors identified by the
subproblem solution are likely to be support vectors of the entire kernel SVM
problem, provided that the problem is partitioned appropriately by kernel
clustering. In the conquer step, the local solutions from the subproblems are
used to initialize a global coordinate descent solver, which converges quickly
as suggested by our analysis. By extending this idea, we develop a multilevel
Divide-and-Conquer SVM algorithm with adaptive clustering and early prediction
strategy, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of training
speed, testing accuracy, and memory usage. As an example, on the covtype
dataset with half-a-million samples, DC-SVM is 7 times faster than LIBSVM in
obtaining the exact SVM solution (to within $10^{-6}$ relative error) which
achieves 96.15% prediction accuracy. Moreover, with our proposed early

applications; one such application is Diffuse Optical Tomography (DOT) in
medical image reconstruction. Such inverse problems present huge computational
challenges, mostly due to the need for solving a sequence of large-scale
discretized, parametrized, partial differential equations (PDEs) in the forward
model. In this paper, we show how interpolatory parametric model reduction can
significantly reduce the cost of the inversion process in DOT by drastically
reducing the computational cost of solving the forward problems. The key
observation is that function evaluations for the underlying optimization
problem may be viewed as transfer function evaluations along the imaginary
axis; a similar observation holds for Jacobian evaluations as well. This
motivates the use of system-theoretic model order reduction methods. We discuss
the construction and use of interpolatory parametric reduced models as
surrogates for the full forward model. Within the DOT setting, these surrogate
models can approximate both the cost functional and the associated Jacobian
with very little loss of accuracy while significantly reducing the cost of the
overall inversion process. Four numerical examples illustrate the efficiency of
the proposed approach. Although we focus on DOT in this paper, we believe that
our approach is applicable much more generally.

points of stable codimension 1 rectifiable currents of dimension $n$. In all of
these cases (of multi-valued harmonic functions and minimal currents), it is
known that the branch sets have Hausdorff dimension $\leq n-2.$ In this paper
we initiate a study of the local structure of branch sets. We show that the
branch set of a two-valued Dirichlet energy minimizing function or a two-valued
$C^{1, \mu}$ harmonic function, in each closed ball of its domain, is either
empty or has positive $(n-2)$-dimensional Hausdorff measure and is equal to the

for various classes of markets. An underlying assumption in early work is that
agents are price-takers, i.e., agents honestly report their true demand in
response to prices. A line of research in economics, initiated by Hurwicz
(1972), is devoted to understanding how such markets perform when agents are
strategic about their demands. This is captured by the \emph{Walrasian
Mechanism} that proceeds by collecting reported demands, finding clearing
prices in the \emph{reported} market via an ascending price t\^{a}tonnement
procedure, and returns the resulting allocation. Similar mechanisms are used,
for example, in the daily opening of the New York Stock Exchange and the call
market for copper and gold in London.
  In practice, it is commonly observed that agents in such markets reduce their
demand leading to behaviors resembling bargaining and to inefficient outcomes.
We ask how inefficient the equilibria can be. Our main result is that the
welfare of every pure Nash equilibrium of the Walrasian mechanism is at least
one quarter of the optimal welfare, when players have gross substitute
valuations and do not overbid. Previous analysis of the Walrasian mechanism
have resorted to large market assumptions to show convergence to efficiency in
the limit. Our result shows that approximate efficiency is guaranteed
regardless of the size of the market.

great interest due to its potential applications for ultralow-power memory and

switch ferromagnets with a perpendicular (out-of-plane) magnetization.
Currently, however, this typically requires the presence of an in-plane
external magnetic field, which is a major obstacle for practical applications.
Here we report for the first time on SOT-induced switching of out-of-plane
magnetized Ta/Co20Fe60B20/TaOx structures without the need for any external
magnetic fields, driven by in-plane currents. This is achieved by introducing a
lateral structural asymmetry into our devices during fabrication. The results
show that a new field-like SOT is induced by in-plane currents in such
asymmetric structures. The direction of the current-induced effective field
corresponding to this new field-like SOT is out-of-plane, which facilitates
switching of perpendicular magnets. This work thus provides a pathway towards
bias-field-free SOT devices.

solution of boundary value problems on arbitrary polyhedral meshes. More
specifically, we focus on the elasticity equations in three-dimensions and
elaborate upon the key concepts underlying the first-order VEM. While the point
of departure is a conforming Galerkin framework, the distinguishing feature of
VEM is that it does not require an explicit computation of the trial and test
spaces, thereby circumventing a barrier to standard finite element
discretizations on arbitrary grids. At the heart of the method is a particular
kinematic decomposition of element deformation states which, in turn, leads to
a corresponding decomposition of strain energy. By capturing the energy of
linear deformations exactly, one can guarantee satisfaction of the engineering
patch test and optimal convergence of numerical solutions. The decomposition
itself is enabled by local projection maps that appropriately extract the rigid
body motion and constant strain components of the deformation. As we show,
computing these projection maps and subsequently the local stiffness matrices,
in practice, reduces to the computation of purely geometric quantities. In
addition to discussing aspects of implementation of the method, we present
several numerical studies in order to verify convergence of the VEM and
evaluate its performance for various types of meshes.

feedback bandwidth, it is imperative to optimize the two resources in a joint
and efficient manner while meeting the delay-QoS requirement. Based on the
effective bandwidth theory, we first obtain a closed-form expression of average
violation probability with respect to a given delay requirement as a function
of transmit power and codebook size of feedback channel. By minimizing the
total resource cost, we derive an optimal joint resource allocation scheme,
which can flexibly adjust the transmit power and feedback bandwidth according
to the characteristics of the system. Moreover, through asymptotic analysis,
some simple resource allocation schemes are presented. Finally, the theoretical
claims are validated by numerical results.

concepts of matroid theory: it asks for the minimum number of elements which
need to be removed to disconnect the remaining nodes from each other. It is
closely related to the theory of network flow problems. The connectivity of a
matroid is an important measure of its robustness as a network. Therefore, it
is very necessary to investigate the conditions under which a matroid is
connected. In this paper, the connectivity for matroids is studied through
relation-based rough sets. First, a symmetric and transitive relation is
introduced from a general matroid and its properties are explored from the
viewpoint of matroids. Moreover, through the relation introduced by a general
matroid, an undirected graph is generalized. Specifically, the connection of
the graph can be investigated by the relation-based rough sets. Second, we
study the connectivity for matroids by means of relation-based rough sets and
some conditions under which a general matroid is connected are presented.
Finally, it is easy to prove that the connectivity for a general matroid with
some special properties and its induced undirected graph is equivalent. These
results show an important application of relation-based rough sets to matroids.

plasmonics makes it possible to dramatically miniaturize optical devices so as
to integrate them into silicon chips. Here we demonstrate that by cascading
nano-corrugation gratings with different periodicities on silver nanowires atop
silicon, different colors can be spatially separated and chronologically
released at different grating junctions. The released light frequency depends
on the grating arrangement and corrugation periodicities. Hence the nanowire
acts as a spectral splitter for sorting/demultiplexing photons at different
nano-scale positions with a ten-femtosecond-level interval. Such nanowires can
be constructed further into compact 2D networks or circuits. We believe that

problems of scientific and technological importance. Chief among them is the
development of H storage and H-resistant materials. H segregation or trapping
at lattice defects, including vacancies, dislocations, grain boundaries, etc,
plays a crucial role in determining the properties of these materials. Here,
through first-principles simulations, we propose a unified mechanism involving
charge transfer induced strain destabilization to understand H segregation
behavior at vacancies. We discover that H prefers to occupy interstitials with
high pre-existing charge densities and the availability of such interstitials
sets the limit on H trapping capacity at a vacancy. Once the maximum H capacity
is reached, the dominant charge donors switch from the nearest-neighbor (NN) to
the next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) metal atoms. Accompanying with this long-range
charge transfer, a significant reorganization energy would occur, leading to
instability of the H-vacancy complex. The physical picture unveiled here
appears universal across the BCC series and is believed to be relevant to other
metals/defects as well. The insight gained from this study is expected to have
important implications for the design of H storage and H-resistant materials.

of the traffic in the network based on its history. Information-Centric
Networks on the other hand provide a finer-grained description of the traffic:
a content between a client and a server is uniquely identified by its name, and
the network can therefore learn the size of different content items, and
perform traffic engineering and resource allocation accordingly. We claim that
Information-Centric Networks can therefore provide a better handle to perform

demonstrated to perform efficiently in a variety of applications, such as
dimensionality reduction, feature learning, and classification. Their
implementation on neuromorphic hardware platforms emulating large-scale
networks of spiking neurons can have significant advantages from the
perspectives of scalability, power dissipation and real-time interfacing with
the environment. However the traditional RBM architecture and the commonly used
training algorithm known as Contrastive Divergence (CD) are based on discrete
updates and exact arithmetics which do not directly map onto a dynamical neural
substrate. Here, we present an event-driven variation of CD to train a RBM
constructed with Integrate & Fire (I&F) neurons, that is constrained by the
limitations of existing and near future neuromorphic hardware platforms. Our
strategy is based on neural sampling, which allows us to synthesize a spiking
neural network that samples from a target Boltzmann distribution. The recurrent
activity of the network replaces the discrete steps of the CD algorithm, while
Spike Time Dependent Plasticity (STDP) carries out the weight updates in an
online, asynchronous fashion. We demonstrate our approach by training an RBM
composed of leaky I&F neurons with STDP synapses to learn a generative model of
the MNIST hand-written digit dataset, and by testing it in recognition,
generation and cue integration tasks. Our results contribute to a machine
learning-driven approach for synthesizing networks of spiking neurons capable
of carrying out practical, high-level functionality.

the most fundamental questions in physics and cosmology today. Whether or not
the acceleration is driven by some form of dark energy, and in the absence of a
well-based theory to interpret the observations, many models have been proposed
to solve this problem, both in the context of General Relativity and
alternative theories of gravity. Actually, a further possibility to investigate
the nature of dark energy lies in measuring the dark energy equation of state
(EOS), w, and its time (or redshift) dependence at high accuracy. However,
since w(z) is not directly accessible to measurement, reconstruction methods
are needed to extract it reliably from observations. Here we investigate
different models of dark energy, described through several parametrizations of
the EOS. Our high-redshift analysis is based on the Union2 Type Ia Supernovae
(SNIa) data set, the Hubble diagram constructed from some Gamma Ray Bursts
(GRBs) luminosity distance indicators, and Gaussian priors on the distance from
the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and the Hubble constant h (these priors
have been included in order to help break the degeneracies among model
parameters). To perform our statistical analysis and to explore the probability
distributions of the EOS parameters we use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method
(MCMC). It turns out that the dark energy equation of state is evolving for all
the parametrizations that we considered. We finally compare our results with
the ones obtained by previous cosmographic analysis performed on the same
astronomical datasets, showing that the latter ones are sufficient to test and
compare the new parametrizations.

allows us to recover the shape of the metallicity distribution with a

preliminary numerical results for the entropy density and its step-scaling

each temperature, discretization effects are removed by simulating the theory
at several lattice spacings and by extrapolating the results to the continuum

absence of ultraviolet power divergences and the remarkably small
discretization effects allow for a precise determination of the step-scaling

relativistic outflows and we infer their inclination angles and the spatial
variations of their flow velocities, magnetic field structures and emissivities
using a common set of fitting functions. The inferred inclinations agree well
with independent indicators. The spreading rates increase rapidly, then
decrease, in a flaring region. The jets then recollimate to form conical outer
regions at distance r0 from the active galactic nucleus (AGN). The flaring
regions are homologous when scaled by r0. At ~0.1r0, the jets brighten abruptly
at the onset of a high-emissivity region and we find an outflow speed of ~0.8c,
with a uniform transverse profile. Jet deceleration first becomes detectable at
~0.2r0 and the outflow often becomes slower at its edges than it is on-axis.
Deceleration continues until ~0.6r0, after which the outflow speed is usually
constant. The dominant magnetic-field component is longitudinal close to the
AGN and toroidal after recollimation, but the field evolution is initially much
slower than predicted by flux-freezing. In the flaring region, acceleration of
ultrarelativistic particles is required to counterbalance the effects of
adiabatic losses and account for observed X-ray synchrotron emission, but the
brightness evolution of the outer jets is consistent with adiabatic losses
alone. We interpret our results as effects of the interaction between the jets

homogeneous elliptic differential operators, with distributions. The elliptic
scaling functions satisfy refinement relations with real isotropic dilation
matrices. The elliptic scaling functions satisfy most of the properties of the
univariate cardinal B-splines: compact support, refinement relation, partition
of unity, total positivity, order of approximation, convolution relation, Riesz
basis formation (under a restriction on the mask), etc. The algebraic
polynomials contained in the span of integer shifts of any elliptic scaling
function belong to the null-space of a homogeneous elliptic differential
operator. Similarly to the properties of the B-splines under differentiation,
it is possible to define elliptic (not necessarily differential) operators such
that the elliptic scaling functions satisfy relations with these operators. In
particular, the elliptic scaling functions can be considered as a composition
of segments, where the function inside a segment, like a polynomial in the case

metallicities with the allowance for the subdivision of GCs into subsystems. We
found evidence for a bar extinction component that causes the observational

widely available online. Basically, from hourly radiance patterns, we derive
the corresponding amount of energy (current and voltage) that is accumulated
over time, and we finally use it to represent the scavenged energy in terms of
its relevant statistics. Toward this end, two clustering approaches for the raw

against the empirical distributions. Our results indicate that Markov models
with just two states provide a rough characterization of the real data traces.
While these could be sufficiently accurate for certain applications, slightly
increasing the number of states to, e.g., eight, allows the representation of
the real energy inflow process with an excellent level of accuracy in terms of

studied by analysing the statistical properties of dynamical trajectories. The
properties of ensembles of such trajectories for long, but fixed, times are
described by large-deviation (LD) rate functions. These LD functions play the
role of dynamical free-energies: they are cumulant generating functions for
time-integrated observables, and their analytic structure encodes dynamical
phase behaviour. This ""thermodynamics of trajectories"" approach is to
trajectories and dynamics what the equilibrium ensemble method of statistical
mechanics is to configurations and statics. Here we show that, just like in the
static case, there is a variety of alternative ensembles of trajectories, each
defined by their global constraints, with that of trajectories of fixed total
time being just one of these. We show that an ensemble of trajectories where
some time-extensive quantity is constant (and large) but where total
observation time fluctuates, is equivalent to the fixed-time ensemble, and the
LD functions that describe one ensemble can be obtained from those that
describe the other. We discuss how the equivalence between generalised
ensembles can be exploited in path sampling schemes for generating rare
dynamical trajectories.

the collapse was induced by two different types of attraction. In each case,
the configurations of the polymer were given by the same subset of random walks
being self-avoiding trails on the square lattice.
  Numerical evidence shows that when interacting via nearest-neighbour
contacts, this transition is different from the collapse transition in
square-lattice trails interacting via multiply visited sites. While both
transitions are second-order, when interacting via nearest-neighbour contacts,
the transition is relatively weak with a convergent specific heat, while when
interacting via multiply visited sites, the specific heat diverges strongly.
Moreover, an estimation of the crossover exponent for the nearest-neighbour
contact interaction provides a value close to that of the canonical polymer
collapse model of interacting self-avoiding walks, which also interact via
nearest-neighbour contacts.
  From computer simulations using the flatPERM algorithm, we extend these
studies by considering a model of self-avoiding trails on the square lattice
containing both types of interaction, and which therefore contains all three of
the models discussed above as special cases. We find that the strong
multiply-visited site collapse is a singular point in the phase diagram and
corresponds to a higher order multi-critical point separating a line of weak
second-order transitions from a line of first-order transitions.

integrate forward in time the coupled system of equations for the Riccati and
the state vector. This can be achieved by using appropriate splitting methods,

Since the coupled system of equations is usually explicitly time dependent, a
preliminary analysis has to be considered. We consider the time as two new
coordinates, and this allows us to integrate the whole system forward in time
using splitting methods while preserving the most relevant qualitative
structure of the exact solution. If the system is a perturbation of an exactly

improves. Some numerical examples are also considered which show the

estimates using arbitrarily-shaped non-coplanar microphone arrays. A novel
geometric formulation is proposed, together with a thorough algebraic analysis
and a global optimization solver. The proposed model is thoroughly described
and evaluated. The geometric analysis, stemming from the direct acoustic
propagation model, leads to necessary and sufficient conditions for a set of
time delays to correspond to a unique position in the source space. Such sets
of time delays are referred to as feasible sets. We formally prove that every
feasible set corresponds to exactly one position in the source space, whose
value can be recovered using a closed-form localization mapping. Therefore we
seek for the optimal feasible set of time delays given, as input, the received
microphone signals. This time delay estimation problem is naturally cast into a
programming task, constrained by the feasibility conditions derived from the
geometric analysis. A global branch-and-bound optimization technique is
proposed to solve the problem at hand, hence estimating the best set of
feasible time delays and, subsequently, localizing the sound source. Extensive
experiments with both simulated and real data are reported; we compare our
methodology to four state-of-the-art techniques. This comparison clearly shows
that the proposed method combined with the branch-and-bound algorithm
outperforms existing methods. These in-depth geometric understanding, practical
algorithms, and encouraging results, open several opportunities for future

after a survey is conducted: before to design and optimize the survey and after
to understand its detection efficiency. The major bottleneck in such
computations is the computation of lightcurves. However, for low-mass planets
most of these computations are wasteful, as most lightcurves do not contain
detectable planetary signatures. In this paper I develop a parameterization of
the binary microlens that is conducive to avoiding lightcurve computations. I
empirically find analytic expressions describing the limits of the parameter
space that contain the vast majority of low-mass planet detections. Through a
large scale simulation I measure the (in)completeness of the parameterization
and the speed-up it is possible to achieve. For Earth-mass planets in a wide
range of orbits it is possible to speed up simulations by a factor of ${\sim}
30$-$125$ (depending on the survey's annual duty-cycle) at the cost of missing
${\sim} 1$ percent of detections (which is actually a smaller loss than for the
arbitrary parameter limits typically applied in microlensing simulations). The
benefits of the parameterization probably outweigh the costs for planets below
$100M_{\oplus}$. For planets at the sensitivity limit of AFTA-WFIRST,
simulation speed-ups of a factor ${\sim} 1000$ or more are possible.

when the commutator is modified to be a function of the momentum only, the
problem of solving for the post-inflationary spectrum of fluctuations is
formally equivalent to solving a one-dimensional Schr\""odinger equation with a
time dependent potential. Depending on the class of modification, we find
results either close to or significantly different from nearly scale invariant
spectra. For the former case, the power spectrum is characterized by step-like
behaviour at some pivot scale, where the magnitude of the jump is
$\mathcal{O}(H^{2}/M_{\star}^{2})$. ($H$ is the inflationary Hubble parameter.)
We use our calculated power spectra to generate predictions for the cosmic
microwave background and baryon acoustic oscillations, hence demonstrating that
certain types of deformations are incompatible with current observations.

differential equations (BSDEs) to study the optimal control of semi-Markov
processes on finite horizon, with general state and action spaces. More
precisely, we prove that the value function and the optimal control law can be
represented by means of the solution of a class of BSDEs driven by a
semi-Markov process or, equivalently, by the associated random measure. The
peculiarity of the semi-Markov framework, with respect to the pure jump Markov
case, consists in the proof of the relation between BSDE and optimal control
problem. This is done, as usual, via the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB)
equation, which however in the semi-Markov case is characterized by an
additional differential term $\partial_a$. Taking into account the particular
structure of semi-Markov processes we rewrite the HJB equation in a suitable
integral form which involves a directional derivative operator $D$ related to
$\partial_a$. Then, using a formula of Ito type tailor-made for semi-Markov
processes and the operator $D$, we are able to prove that the BSDE provides the
unique classical solution to the HJB equation, which is shown to be the value
function of our control problem.

the regular algebra over $L(E),$ we prove that these conditions are further
equivalent with any of the following: $L(E)$ contains no infinite set of
orthogonal idempotents, $L(E)$ has finite uniform dimension, $L(E)$ is directly
finite, $Q(E)$ is directly finite, $Q(E)$ is unit-regular, and a few more
equivalences. In addition, if the involution on $K$ is positive definite, these
conditions are equivalent with the following: the involution $^\ast$ extends
from $L(E)$ to $Q(E),$ $Q(E)$ is $^\ast$-regular, $Q(E)$ is finite, $Q(E)$ is
the maximal (total or classical) symmetric ring of quotients of $L(E),$ every
finitely generated nonsingular $L(E)$-module is projective, and the matrix ring
$M_n(L(E))$ is strongly Baer for every $n$. It may not be surprising that a
noetherian Leavitt path algebra has these properties, but a more interesting
fact is that these properties hold only if a Leavitt path algebra is
noetherian.
  Using some of these equivalences, we give a specific description of the
inverse of the isomorphism $V(L(E))\rightarrow V(Q(E))$ of monoids of
equivalence classes of finitely generated projective modules for noetherian
Leavitt path algebras. We also prove that two noetherian Leavitt path algebras
are isomorphic as rings if and only if they are isomorphic as $^\ast$-algebras.
This answers in affirmative the Isomorphism Conjecture for the class of
noetherian Leavitt path algebras: if $L_{\mathbb C}(E)$ and $L_{\mathbb C}(F)$
are noetherian Leavitt path algebras, then $L_{\mathbb C}(E)\cong L_{\mathbb
C}(F)$ as rings implies $C^*(E)\cong C^*(F)$ as $^\ast$-algebras.

the superconducting energy gap correlates with the unit-cell volume and a

  In order to simplify the usage of chemical networks in large numerical
simulations, we present the chemistry package KROME, consisting of a Python
pre-processor which generates a subroutine for the solution of chemical
networks which can be embedded in any numerical code. For the solution of the
rate equations, we make use of the high-order solver DLSODES, which was shown
to be both accurate and efficient for sparse networks, which are typical in
astrophysical applications. KROME also provides a large set of physical
processes connected to chemistry, including photochemistry, cooling, heating,
dust treatment, and reverse kinetics.
  The package presented here already contains a network for primordial
chemistry, a small metal network appropriate for the modelling of low
metallicities environments, a detailed network for the modelling of molecular
clouds, a network for planetary atmospheres, as well as a framework for the
modelling of the dust grain population. In this paper, we present an extended

towards a possible Li-O anti-correlation in the TO stars of 47 Tuc. We find no
convincing evidence supporting the existence of Li-Na correlation. The obtained
3D NLTE mean lithium abundance in a sample of 94 TO stars where Li lines were
detected reliably, $\langle A({\rm Li})_{\rm 3D~NLTE}\rangle = 1.78 \pm 0.18$
dex, appears to be significantly lower than what is observed in other globular
clusters. At the same time, star-to-star spread in Li abundance is also larger
than seen in other clusters. The highest Li abundance observed in 47 Tuc is
about 0.1 dex lower than the lowest Li abundance observed among the un-depleted
stars of the metal-poor open cluster NGC 2243. The lithium abundances in 47
Tuc, when put into context with observations in other clusters and field stars,
suggest that stars that are more metal-rich than [FeH] \sim -1.0 experience
significant lithium depletion during their lifetime on the main sequence, while
the more metal-poor stars do not. Rather strikingly, our results suggest that
initial lithium abundance with which the star was created may only depend on
its age (the younger the star, the higher its Li content) and not on its
metallicity.

lattice models of interacting spinful fermions - BCS-like models, which exhibit
continuous quantum phase transitions. The considered models originate from a
two-dimensional model of d-wave superconductivity proposed by Sachdev. Due to
the exact diagonalizability of the considered models in any dimensionality,
exact phase diagrams, with several kinds of quantum-critical points, are
constructed and closed-form analytic expressions for two-point correlation
functions are obtained. In one- and two-dimensional cases we provide analytic
expressions for the asymptotic behavior of those correlation functions at large
distances and in neighborhoods of quantum-critical points. The novelty of our
results is that in two-dimensions explicit expressions for direction-dependent
correlation lengths in terms of model parameters and the values of
direction-dependent universal critical indices $\nu$, that characterize the
divergence of correlation lengths on approaching critical points, are
determined. Moreover, specific scaling properties of correlation functions with
respect to parameters of underlying Hamiltonians are revealed. Besides
enriching the knowledge of properties of lattice fermion systems exhibiting
continuous quantum phase transitions, especially in two dimensions, our results
open new possibilities of testing unconventional methods of studying quantum
phase transitions, as the promising fidelity approach or the entanglement
approach, beyond one-dimension and beyond the realm of paradigmatic XY and

discussed. The formalization of polyhedrons is done in a rather traditional

networks in disjunctive normal form (DNF) and conjunctive normal forms (CNF)
are introduced. The main theme is that single output perceptron neural networks
and characteristic functions of polyhedrons are one and the same class of
functions. A rigorous formulation and proof that three layers suffice is
obtained. The various constructions and results are among several steps
required for algorithms that replace incremental and statistical learning with
more efficient, direct and exact geometric methods for calculation of

presence of gravitational time dilation and show that the latter leads to
decoherence of quantum superpositions. Time dilation induces a universal
coupling between internal degrees of freedom and the centre-of-mass of a
composite particle. The resulting correlations cause decoherence of the

the weak time dilation on Earth is already sufficient to decohere micron scale

liquids that display a liquid-liquid phase transition (LLPT): Si described by
the Stillinger-Weber potential and Ga as modeled by the modified embedded-atom
model (MEAM). In particular, our objective is to investigate the extent to
which the presence of a dip in the self-intermediate scattering function is a
manifestation of an excess of vibrational states at low frequencies and may be
associated with a fragile-to-strong transition (FTST) across the LLPT, as
suggested recently. Our results do not lend support to these suggestions.
Specifically, in the case of Ga we observe the appearance of an excess of
vibrational states at low frequencies, even in the absence of the appearance of
a dip in the self-intermediate scattering function across the LLPT.
Furthermore, studying the behavior of the shear viscosities traversing the
LLPTs we find that, despite the development of a dip in the self-intermediate
scattering function for the case of Si and its absence in Ga, both substances
are fragile in character above and below their respective LLPT temperatures.

Monoceros R2 (Mon R2), at a distance of 830 pc, is the only
ultra-compact H ii region (UC H ii) where its associated photon-dominated
region (PDR) can be resolved with the Herschel Space Observatory. Aims. Our aim
is to investigate observationally the kinematical patterns in the interface
regions (i.e., the transition from atomic to molecular gas) associated with Mon
R2. Methods. We used the HIFI instrument onboard Herschel to observe the line
profiles of the reactive ions CH+, OH+ and H2O+ toward different positions in
Mon R2. We derive the column density of these molecules and compare them with
gas-phase chemistry models. Results. The reactive ion CH+ is detected both in
emission (at central and red-shifted velocities) and in absorption (at
blue-shifted velocities). OH+ is detected in absorption at both blue- and
red-shifted velocities, with similar column densities. H2O+ is not detected at
any of the positions, down to a rms of 40 mK toward the molecular peak. At this
position, we find that the OH+ absorption originates in a mainly atomic medium,
and therefore is associated with the most exposed layers of the PDR. These
results are consistent with the predictions from photo-chemical models. The
line profiles are consistent with the atomic gas being entrained in the ionized
gas flow along the walls of the cavity of the H ii region. Based on this
evidence, we are able to propose a new geometrical model for this region.
Conclusions. The kinematical patterns of the OH+ and CH+ absorption indicate
the existence of a layer of mainly atomic gas for which we have derived, for
the first time, some physical parameters and its dynamics.

Yukawa interaction $\Lambda$ and showed that its most probable value in the
case of S2 star is around 5000 - 7000 AU. At the same time, we were not able to
obtain reliable constrains on the universal constant $\delta$ of Yukawa
gravity, because the current observations of S2 star indicated that it may be
highly correlated with parameter $\Lambda$ in the range $(0 <\delta < 1)$. For
$\delta > 2$ they are not correlated. However, the same universal constant
which was successfully applied to clusters of galaxies and rotation curves of
spiral galaxies ($\delta=1/3$) also gives a satisfactory agreement with the
observed orbital precession of the S2 star, and in that case the most probable
value for the scale parameter is $\Lambda \approx 3000 \pm 1500$ AU. Also, the
Yukawa gravity potential induces precession of S2 star orbit in the same

the opposite direction for $-1 <\delta < 0$. The future observations with
advanced facilities, such as GRAVITY or/and European Extremely Large Telescope,

equations that describe the chemical reactions of the Gray-Scott model (GS):
$U+2V {\stackrel {\lambda}{\rightarrow}} 3 V;$ and $V {\stackrel
{\mu}{\rightarrow}} P$, $U {\stackrel {\nu}{\rightarrow}} Q$, with a constant
feed rate for $U$. We find that the conservation of probability ensured by the
chemical master equation leads to a modification of the usual differential
equations for the GS model which now involves two composite fields and also
intrinsic noise terms. One of the composites is $\psi_1 = \phi_v^2$, where $ <
\phi_v >_{\eta} = v$ is the concentration of the species $V$ and the averaging
is over the internal noise $\eta_{u,v,\psi_1}$. The second composite field is
the product of three fields $ \chi = \lambda \phi_u \phi_v^2$ and requires a
noise source to ensure probability conservation. A third composite $\psi_2 =
\phi_{u} \phi_{v}$ can be also be identified from the noise-induced reactions.
The Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the many-body wave function,
associated with the master equation, has a broken U(1) symmetry related to
particle number conservation. By expanding around the (broken symmetry) zero
energy solution of the Hamiltonian (by performing a Doi shift) one obtains from
our path integral formulation the usual reaction diffusion equation, at the
classical level. The Langevin equations that are derived from the chemical
master equation have multiplicative noise sources for the density fields
$\phi_u, \phi_v, \chi$ that induce higher order processes such as $n
\rightarrow n$ scattering for $n > 3$. The amplitude of the noise acting on $
\phi_v$ is itself stochastic in nature.

measure, defined for a sequence $A$ of $m$ points and a sequence $B$ of $n$
points, where the points are usually sampled from input curves. In this paper
we consider a variant, called the \emph{discrete Fr\'echet distance with
shortcuts}, which captures the similarity between (sampled) curves in the
presence of outliers. For the \emph{two-sided} case, where shortcuts are
allowed in both curves, we give an $O((m^{2/3}n^{2/3}+m+n)\log^3 (m+n))$-time
algorithm for computing this distance. When shortcuts are allowed only in one
noise-containing curve, we give an even faster randomized algorithm that runs
in $O((m+n)^{6/5+\varepsilon})$ expected time, for any $\varepsilon>0$.
  Our techniques are novel and may find further applications. One of the main
new technical results is: Given two sets of points $A$ and $B$ and an interval
$I$, we develop an algorithm that decides whether the number of pairs $(x,y)\in
A\times B$ whose distance ${\rm dist}(x,y)$ is in $I$, is less than some given
threshold $L$. The running time of this algorithm decreases as $L$ increases.
In case there are more than $L$ pairs of points whose distance is in $I$, we
can get a small sample of pairs that contains a pair at approximate median
distance (i.e., we can approximately ""bisect"" $I$). We combine this procedure
with additional ideas to search, with a small overhead, for the optimal
one-sided Fr\'echet distance with shortcuts, using a very fast decision
procedure. We also show how to apply this technique for approximating distance
selection (with respect to rank), and for computing the semi-continuous
Fr\'echet distance with one-sided shortcuts.

scalar decompositions using efficient endomorphisms-including
Gallant-Lambert-Vanstone (GLV) and Galbraith-Lin-Scott (GLS) multiplication, as
well as higher-dimensional and higher-genus constructions-is to produce a short
basis of a certain integer lattice involving the eigenvalues of the
endomorphisms. The shorter the basis vectors, the shorter the decomposed scalar
coefficients, and the faster the resulting scalar multiplication. Typically,
knowledge of the eigenvalues allows us to write down a long basis, which we
then reduce using the Euclidean algorithm, Gauss reduction, LLL, or even a more
specialized algorithm. In this work, we use elementary facts about quadratic
rings to immediately write down a short basis of the lattice for the GLV, GLS,
GLV+GLS, and Q-curve constructions on elliptic curves, and for genus 2 real
multiplication constructions. We do not pretend that this represents a
significant optimization in scalar multiplication, since the lattice reduction
step is always an offline precomputation---but it does give a better insight
into the structure of scalar decompositions. In any case, it is always more
convenient to use a ready-made short basis than it is to compute a new one.

on the relative width of the magnetic film, $L$, compared to the wavelength of

small systems ($L<\lambda$), the transition is associated with the Standard
Stochastic Resonance regime, while, for large systems ($L>\lambda$), the

Bernoulli site percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with parameter $p$, known also as
percolation of words.\ In 1995, I.\ Benjamini and H.\ Kesten proved that, for
$d \geq 10$ and $p=1/2$, all sequences can be embedded, almost surely. They
conjectured that the same should hold for $d \geq 3$. In this paper we consider
$d \geq 3$ and $p \in (p_c(d), 1-p_c(d))$, where $p_c(d)<1/2$ is the critical
threshold for site percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$. We show that there exists an
integer $M = M (p)$, such that, a.s., every binary sequence, for which every
run of consecutive {0s} or {1s} contains at least $M$ digits, can be embedded.

modulation of absorption features on the rotational timescale, but not strictly
periodic over longer timescales. For these stars no dipolar magnetic fields
have been detected, with upper limits below 300 G. Similar cyclical variability
is also found in many optical lines, which are formed at the base of the wind.
We propose that these cyclical variations are caused by the presence of
multiple, transient, short-lived, corotating magnetic loops, which we call
""stellar prominences"". We present a simplified model representing these
prominences to explain the cyclical optical wind-line variability in the O
supergiant lambda Cephei. Other supporting evidence for such prominences comes
from the recent discovery of photometric variability in a comparable O star,
which was explained by the presence of multiple transient bright spots,
presumably of magnetic origin as well.

diffusion halo plays the role of secondary sources to reconstruct the mean
Green's function. We then show that fluctuations of NCF are governed by several
non-Gaussian correlations. An infinite-range NCF correlation dominates CDOS
fluctuations and proves that NCF is not a self averaging quantity with respect
to the plurality of noise sources. The link between these correlations and the
intensity ones is highlighted. These results are supported by numerical
simulations and are of importance for passive imaging applications and material

entanglement, discord is subject to destruction by external noise. The routes

integration or other purposes. This topological characterization of $%

time evolutions of discord in physical models. The classification for discord
contrasts sharply with the possible evolutions of entanglement.
  Using topological methods, we classify the possible joint evolutions of
entanglement and discord. There are 9 allowed categories: 6 categories for a
Markovian process and 3 categories for a non-Markovian process, respectively.
We illustrate these conclusions with an anisotropic XY spin model. All 9

of dynamical systems -- combinatorial, piecewise-linear, and birational -- and
shows the relationship between these three settings. In particular, we show how
the rowmotion and promotion operations of Striker and Williams can be lifted to
(continuous) piecewise-linear operations on the order polytope of Stanley, and
then lifted to birational operations on the positive orthant in
$\mathbb{R}^{|P|}$ and indeed to a dense subset of $\mathbb{C}^{|P|}$. When the
poset $P$ is a product of a chain of length $a$ and a chain of length $b$,
these lifted operations have order $a+b$, and exhibit the homomesy phenomenon:
the time-averages of various quantities are the same in all orbits. One
important tool is a concrete realization of the conjugacy between rowmotion and
promotion found by Striker and Williams; this $recombination$ $map$ allows us
to use homomesy for promotion to deduce homomesy for rowmotion.

polytope and the chain polytope arises as the tropicalization of an analogous

recently many studies stressing the psychological and social dimension of
financial behavior have challenged the validity of the EMH. Towards this aim,
over the last few years, internet-based communication platforms and search
engines have been used to extract early indicators of social and economic
trends. Here, we used Twitter's social networking platform to model and
forecast the EUR/USD exchange rate in a high-frequency intradaily trading
scale. Using time series and trading simulations analysis, we provide some

  Stochastic Differential Equations",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, we concern with the high order numerical methods for coupled
forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs). Based on the
FBSDEs theory, we derive two reference ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
from the backward SDE, which contain the conditional expectations and their
derivatives. Then, our high order multi-step schemes are obtained by carefully
approximating the derivatives and the conditional expectations in the reference
ODEs. Motivated by the local property of the generator of diffusion processes,
the Euler method is used to solve the forward SDE, however, it is noticed that
the numerical solution of the backward SDE is still of high order accuracy.
Such results are obviously promising: on one hand, the use of Euler method (for
the forward SDE) can dramatically simplifies the entire computational scheme,
and on the other hand, one might be only interested in the solution of the
backward SDE in many real applications such as option pricing. Several
numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
numerical method.

result of scouring of stars by mergers of binary supermassive black holes. Past
investigations have suggested correlations between the central black hole mass
and the stellar light or mass deficit in the core, using proxy measurements of
$M_{\rm BH}$ or stellar mass-to-light ratios ($\Upsilon$). Drawing on a wealth
of dynamical models which provide both $M_{\rm BH}$ and $\Upsilon$, we identify
cores in 23 galaxies, of which 20 have direct, reliable measurements of $M_{\rm
BH}$ and dynamical stellar mass-to-light ratios ($\Upsilon_{\star,{\rm dyn}}$).
These cores are identified and measured using Core-S\'ersic model fits to
surface brightness profiles which extend out to large radii (typically more
than the effective radius of the galaxy); for approximately one fourth of the
galaxies, the best fit includes an outer (\sersic) envelope component. We find
that the core radius is most strongly correlated with the black hole mass and
that it correlates better with total galaxy luminosity than it does with
velocity dispersion. The strong core-size-- $M_{\rm BH}$ correlation enables
estimation of black hole masses (in core galaxies) with an accuracy comparable
to the $M_{\rm BH}$--$\sigma$ relation (rms scatter of 0.30 dex in $\log M_{\rm
BH}$), without the need for spectroscopy. The light and mass deficits correlate
more strongly with galaxy velocity dispersion than they do with black hole
mass. Stellar mass deficits span a range of 0.2--39 \mbh, with almost all (87%)
being $< 10 \, M_{\rm BH}$; the median value is 2.2 $M_{\rm BH}$.

mass-dependent stellar lifetimes. Light cones are built through the simulation
outputs and samples of one hundred maps for the resulting temperature
fluctuations are derived for both Gaussian and non-Gaussian primordial
perturbations. From them, we estimate the possible changes due to early
non-Gaussianities on: SZ maps, probability distribution functions, angular
power spectra and corresponding bispectra. We find that the different growth of
structures in the different cases induces significant spectral distortions only
in models with large non-Gaussian parameters, $f_{\rm NL}$. In general, the
overall trends are covered by the non-linear, baryonic evolution, whose
feedback mechanisms tend to randomize the gas behaviour and homogenize its
statistical features, quite independently from the background matter
distribution. Deviations due to non-Gaussianity are almost undistinguishable
for $f_{\rm NL}\lesssim 100$, remaining always at few-per-cent level, within
the error bars of the Gaussian scenario. Rather extreme models with $f_{\rm

overcoming baryon contaminations and showing discrepancies up to a factor of a

the question of whether there are degrees of compatibility which could be
represented by some quantitative measure, and whether there is a
straightforward procedure whereby the observers can pool their information to
arrive at a unique joint state assignment. We argue that such measures are only
sensible given some assumption about what kind of information was used in
making the state assignments in the first place, and that in general state
assignments do not represent all of the information possessed by the observers.
However, we examine one particular measure, and show that it has a
straightforward interpretation, assuming that the information was acquired from
a particular type of measurement, and that in this case there is a natural rule
for pooling information. We extend this measure to compatibility of states for
k observers, and show that the value is the solution to a semidefinite program.

developed into an active and exciting branch of condensed matter physics. This
research field provides rich new insights that could not be obtained from the
study of equilibrium situations, and the theoretical understanding of the
physics often requires the development of new concepts and methods. On the
experimental side, ultra-fast pump-probe spectroscopies enable studies of
excitation and relaxation phenomena in correlated electron systems, while
ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices provide a new way to control and measure
the time-evolution of interacting lattice systems with a vastly different
characteristic timescale compared to electron systems. A theoretical
description of these phenomena is challenging because, firstly, we have to
compute the quantum-mechanical time-evolution of many-body systems out of
equilibrium, and secondly, deal with strong-correlation effects which can be of
nonperturbative nature. In this review, we discuss the nonequilibrium extension
of the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), which treats quantum fluctuations in
the time domain and works directly in the thermodynamic limit. The method
reduces the complexity of the calculation via a mapping to a self-consistent
impurity problem. Particular emphasis is placed on a detailed derivation of the
formalism, and on a discussion of numerical techniques, which enable solutions
of the effective nonequilibrium DMFT impurity problem. We summarize the
insights gained into the properties of the infinite-dimensional Hubbard model
under strong non-equilibrium conditions. These examples illustrate the current
ability of the theoretical framework to reproduce and understand fundamental
nonequilibrium phenomena, such as the dielectric breakdown of Mott insulators,
photo-doping, and collapse-and-revival oscillations in quenched systems.

impossible. Indeed we were able to find two examples of integrable models
embedded in Supergravity in this way. Both examples are fitted into N=1
Supergravity by means of a very specific and interesting choice of the
superpotential W(z). The question whether there are examples of such an
embedding in extended Gauged Supergravity remains open. In the present paper,
relying on the embedding tensor formalism we classified all gaugings of the N=2
STU model, confirming, in the absence on hypermultiplets, the uniqueness of the
stable de Sitter vacuum found several years ago by Fre, Trigiante and Van
Proeyen and excluding the embedding of any integrable cosmological model. A
detailed analysis of the space of exact solutions of the first Supergravity
embedded integrable cosmological model revealed several new features worth an
in depth consideration. When the scalar potential has an extremum at a negative
value, the universe necessarily collapses into a Big Crunch notwithstanding its
spatial flatness. The causal structure of these universes is quite different
from that of the closed, positive curved, universe: indeed in this case the
particle and event horizons do not coincide and develop complicated patterns.
The cosmological consequences of this unexpected mechanism deserve careful

particular interest is the study of distant, remote stars moving in large

majority of the distant stars perform chaotic orbits. However, there are also
distant stars displaying regular motion as well. Most distant stars are ejected
into the galactic halo on approaching the dense and massive nucleus. We study
the influence of some important parameters of the dynamical system, such as the
mass of the nucleus and the angular momentum, by computing in each case the
percentage of regular and chaotic orbits. A second order polynomial
relationship connects the mass of the nucleus and the critical angular momentum
of the distant star. Some heuristic semi-theoretical arguments to explain and
justify the numerically derived outcomes are also given. Our numerical
calculations suggest that the majority of distant stars spend their orbital
time in the halo where it is easy to be observed. We present evidence that the

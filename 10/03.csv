$t^{-\theta}$ at large times $t$. Two theoretical conjectures exist for the

aggregates predicts $\theta= 2d/(d+2)$ in $d$ dimensions. The other based on

reprocessed by dust) from all galaxies throughout the history of the Universe.
The attenuation of 40 - 400 GeV gamma-rays has been observed by \textit{Fermi}
and used to measure the EBL spectrum over energies 1 eV -10 eV out to redshift
$z\sim 1$. Measurements of several TeV blazers are consistent with attenuation,
attributed to the EBL at redshift $z\sim 0.1$. Here we simultaneously analyze a
set of TeV blazers at $z\sim 0.1$ to measure the optical depth for 100 GeV - 10
TeV gamma-rays, which interact with EBL of energies 0.05 eV - 5 eV. Using a
suite of models for the EBL, we show that the optical depth indicated by TeV
blazar attenuation is in good agreement with the optical depths measured by
\textit{Fermi} at lower gamma-ray energies and higher redshifts.

identify the precise structure of hydrogenated single atomic vacancies in a
topmost graphene layer of graphite and establish a connection between the
details of hydrogen passivation and the electronic properties of a single
atomic vacancy. Monovacancy-hydrogen complexes are prepared by sputtering of
the graphite surface layer with low energy ions and then exposing it briefly to
an atomic hydrogen environment. High-resolution experimental UHV-STM imaging
allows us to determine unambiguously the positions of single missing atoms in
the defective graphene lattice and, in combination with the ab initio
calculations, provides detailed information about the distribution of
low-energy electronic states on the periphery of the monovacancy-hydrogen
complexes. We found that a single atomic vacancy where each sigma-dangling bond
is passivated with one hydrogen atom shows a well-defined signal from the
non-bonding pi-state which penetrates into the bulk with a (\sqrt 3 \times
\sqrt 3)R30^ \circ periodicity. However, a single atomic vacancy with full
hydrogen termination of sigma-dangling bonds and additional hydrogen
passivation of the extended pi-state at one of the vacancy's monohydrogenated
carbon atoms is characterized by complete quenching of low-energy localized
states. In addition, we discuss the migration of hydrogen atoms at the
periphery of the monovacancy-hydrogen complexes which dramatically change the
vacancy's low-energy electronic properties, as observed in our low-bias
high-resolution STM imaging.

The algebra $\Den(M)$ is graded by real numbers and possesses a natural
invariant scalar product. This leads to important geometric consequences and
applications to geometric constructions on the original manifold. In
particular, there is a classification theorem for derivations of the algebra
$\Den(M)$. It allows a natural definition of bracket operations on vector
densities of various weights on a (super)manifold $M$, similar to how the
classical Fr\""{o}licher--Nijenhuis theorem on derivations of the algebra of
differential forms leads to the Nijenhuis bracket. It is possible to extend
this classification from ""vector fields"" (derivations) on $\Den(M)$ to
""multivector fields"". This leads to the striking result that an arbitrary even
Poisson structure on $M$ possesses a canonical lifting to the algebra of
densities. (The latter two statements were obtained by our student A.Biggs.)
This is in sharp contrast with the previously studied case of an odd Poisson
structure, where extra data are required for such a lifting.

advantage of Stevenson's complex linear-fraction transformation S(y) of the
variable y restricted to the real axis. It was explicitly demonstrated that
Stevenson's hypergeometric polynomials in a complex argument S are nothing but
Romanovsky polynomials converted from y to S. The use of Stevenson's
mathematical arguments unambiguously confirmed 'exact solvability' of the
Milson potential. It was revealed that the Milson potential has two branches
referred to as 'inside' and 'outside' depending on positions of zeros of the
so-called 'tangent polynomial' (TP) relative to the unit circle. The two
intersect along the shape-invariant Gendenshtein (Scarf II) potential. The
remarkable feature of the RCSLE associated with the inner branch of the Milson
potential (as well as its shape-invariant limit) is that it has two sequences
of nodeless almost-everywhere holomorphic (AEH) solutions which can be used as
factorization functions (FFs) for constructing new quantized-by-polynomials
potentials. In case of the Gendenshtein potential complex-conjugated
characteristic exponents (ChExps) at finite singular points of the given RCSLE
become energy independent so that each polynomial sequence turns into a finite
set of orthogonal polynomials. This confirms Quesne's conjecture [J. Math.

be used for constructing orthogonal polynomials of novel type.

matter in stars from a knowledge of their macroscopic observables (e.g. their

a spectral representation of the equation of state whose stellar models match a
prescribed set of macroscopic observables. This paper improves and extends that
work in two significant ways: i) The method is made more robust by accounting
for an unexpected feature of the enthalpy based representations of the
equations of state used in this work. After making the appropriate
modifications, accurate initial guesses for the spectral parameters are no
longer needed so Monte-Carlo techniques can now be used to ensure the best fit
to the observables. ii) The method is extended here to use masses and tidal
deformabilities (which will be measured by gravitational wave observations of
neutron-star mergers) as the macroscopic observables instead of masses and
radii. The accuracy and reliability of this extended and more robust spectral
method is evaluated in this paper using mock data for observables from stars
based on 34 different theoretical models of the high density neutron-star
equation of state. In qualitative agreement with earlier work, these tests
suggest the high density part of the neutron-star equation of state could be
determined at the few-percent accuracy level using high quality measurements of
the masses and radii (or masses and tidal deformabilities) of just two or three
neutron stars.

assymmetric emission that can be attributed to a bulge in the accretion disk,

the source at times concurrent with the optical observations are significantly
lower during our observations than during optical observations taken in 2003.

often require efficient and accurate estimation of their second-order
statistics. With rapidly changing data, limited processing power and storage at
the acquisition devices, it is desirable to extract the covariance structure
from a single pass over the data and a small number of stored measurements. In
this paper, we explore a quadratic (or rank-one) measurement model which
imposes minimal memory requirements and low computational complexity during the
sampling process, and is shown to be optimal in preserving various
low-dimensional covariance structures. Specifically, four popular structural
assumptions of covariance matrices, namely low rank, Toeplitz low rank,
sparsity, jointly rank-one and sparse structure, are investigated, while
recovery is achieved via convex relaxation paradigms for the respective
structure.
  The proposed quadratic sampling framework has a variety of potential
applications including streaming data processing, high-frequency wireless
communication, phase space tomography and phase retrieval in optics, and
non-coherent subspace detection. Our method admits universally accurate
covariance estimation in the absence of noise, as soon as the number of
measurements exceeds the information theoretic limits. We also demonstrate the
robustness of this approach against noise and imperfect structural assumptions.
Our analysis is established upon a novel notion called the mixed-norm
restricted isometry property (RIP-$\ell_{2}/\ell_{1}$), as well as the
conventional RIP-$\ell_{2}/\ell_{2}$ for near-isotropic and bounded
measurements. In addition, our results improve upon the best-known phase
retrieval (including both dense and sparse signals) guarantees using PhaseLift
with a significantly simpler approach.

dramatically across the heliopause (HP). This rotation was used as one of the
criteria to determine if Voyager 1 (V1) had crossed the HP. Recently the
Voyager team concluded that V1 crossed into interstellar space last year
(Gurnett et al. 2013). The question is then why there was no significant
rotation in the direction of the magnetic field across the HP (Burlaga et al.
2013). Here we present simulations that reveal that strong rotations in the
direction of the magnetic field at the HP at the location of V1 (and Voyager 2)
are not expected. The solar magnetic field strongly affects the drapping of the
interstellar magnetic field (BISM) around the HP. BISM twists as it approaches
the HP and acquires a strong T component (east-west). The strong increase in
the T component occurs where the interstellar flow stagnates in front of the
HP. At this same location the N component BN is significantly reduced. Above
and below the neighboring interstellar magnetic field lines also twist into the
T direction. This behavior occurs for a wide range of orientations of BISM.
Thus, the BN component at the V1 location and the associated angle delta=a
sin(BN/B) are small (around 10-20 degrees), as seen in the observations
(Burlaga et al. 2013). Only after some significant distance outside the HP, is
the direction of the interstellar field distinguishably different from that of
the Parker spiral.

measure the standard deviation of the density distribution, constraining it to
the range $1.5 < \sigma_s < 1.9$ assuming that the density is lognormally

laws. The method of averaging over different excitation conditions to produce a

statistically significant sample of 103 galaxies at z~2 using near-infrared
spectroscopy taken as part of the 3D-HST survey. We derive redshifts,
metallicities and star formation rates (SFRs) from the [OII], [OIII] and Hbeta
nebular emission lines and exploit the multi-wavelength photometry available in
CANDELS to measure stellar masses. We find the mass-metallicity relation (MZR)
derived from our data to have the same trend as previous determinations in the
range 0<z<3, with lower mass galaxies having lower metallicities. However we
find an offset in the relation compared to the previous determination of the
z~2 MZR by Erb et al. 2006b, who measure metallicities using the [NII]/Halpha
ratio, with metallicities lower at a given mass. Incorporating our SFR
information we find that our galaxies are offset from the Fundamental
Metallicity Relation (FMR) by ~0.3 dex. We investigate the photoionization
conditions and find that our galaxies are consistent with the elevated
ionization parameter previously reported in high-redshift galaxies. Using the
BPT diagram we argue that, if this is the case, metallicity indicators based on
[NII] and Halpha may not be consistent with the ones obtained via oxygen lines
and Hbeta. Using a recent determination of the theoretical evolution of the
star forming sequence in the BPT diagram we convert our measured [OIII]/Hbeta
line ratios to [NII]/Halpha ratios. From the [NII]/Halpha ratio we infer
systematically higher metallicities in better agreement with the FMR. Our
results thus suggest the evolution of the FMR previously reported at z~2-3 may
be an artifact of the differential evolution in metallicity indicators, and
caution against using locally calibrated metallicity relations at high redshift
which do not account for evolution in the physical conditions of star-forming
regions.

0.859) from 2008 August through 2011 December, using the SMARTS Consortium
1.5m+RCSpectrograph and 1.3m+ANDICAM in Cerro Tololo, Chile. The spectra reveal
that the broad optical emission lines Mg II, H-beta and H-gamma are far less
variable than the optical or gamma-ray continuum. Although, the gamma-rays
varied by a factor of 100 above the EGRET era flux, the lines generally vary by
a factor of 2 or less. Smaller variations in the gamma-ray flux did not produce
significant variation in any of the observed emission lines. Therefore, to
first order, the ionizing flux from the disk changes only slowly during large
variations of the jet. However, two exceptions in the response of the broad
emission lines are reported during the largest gamma-ray flares in 2009
December and 2010 November, when significant deviations from the mean line flux
in H-gamma and Mg II were observed. H-gamma showed a maximum 3-sigma and
4-sigma deviation in each flare, respectively, corresponding to a factor of 1.7
and 2.5 increase in flux. Mg II showed a 2-sigma deviation in both flares; no
variation was detected in H-beta during either flare. These significant
deviations from the mean line flux also coincide with 7mm core ejections
reported previously (Jorstad et al. 2012). The correlation of the increased
emission line flux with mm core ejections, and gamma-ray, optical and UV flares
suggests that the broad line region extends beyond the gamma-emitting region
during the 2009 and 2010 flares.

X-ray spectrum shows no evidence for the soft excess commonly observed amongst
other active galaxies, despite its relatively low level of obscuration, and is
dominated across the whole Suzaku bandpass by the intrinsic powerlaw-like
continuum. Despite this, we clearly detect the presence of a low frequency hard
lag of ~1600s between the 0.5-2.0 and 2.0-5.0 keV energy bands at greater than
6-sigma significance, similar to those reported in the literature for a variety
of other AGN. At these energies, any additional emission from e.g. a very weak,
undetected soft excess, or from distant reflection must contribute less than 3%
of the observed countrates (at 90% confidence). Given the lack of any
significant continuum emission component other than the powerlaw, we can rule
out models that invoke distant reprocessing for the observed lag behavior,
which must instead be associated with this continuum emission. These results
are fully consistent with a propagating fluctuation origin for the low
frequency hard lags, and with the interpretation of the high frequency soft
lags - a common feature seen in the highest quality AGN data with strong soft
excesses - as reverberation from the inner accretion disk.

gives access to the entanglement properties of various interesting systems,
such as spin ladders as well as two-dimensional topological phases. By
expanding interchain interactions to quadratic order in bosonic fields, we are
able to calculate the ES for both gapped and gapless systems using only methods
for free theories. In certain gapless phases of coupled non-chiral TLLs, we
interestingly find an ES with a dispersion relation proportional to the square
root of the subsystem momentum, which we relate to a long-range interaction in
the entanglement Hamiltonian. We numerically demonstrate the emergence of this
unusual dispersion in a model of hard-core bosons on a ladder. In gapped phases
of coupled non-chiral TLLs, which are relevant to spin ladders and topological
insulators, we show that the ES consists of linearly dispersing modes, which
resembles the spectrum of a single-chain TLL but is characterized by a modified
TLL parameter. Based on a calculation for coupled chiral TLLs, we are also able
to provide a very simple proof for the correspondence between the ES and the
edge-state spectrum in quantum Hall systems consistent with previous numerical
and analytical studies.

turning speed $\gamma$. We show, through simulations and analytical

that at low values of $\gamma$, particle motion is diffusive and characterized
by a diffusion coefficient that displays a minimum at an intermediate obstacle
density $\rho_o$. We observe that in high obstacle density regions and for
large $\gamma$ values, spontaneous trapping of active particles occurs. We show
that such trapping leads to genuine subdiffusive motion of the active

two cold, symmetric, relativistically colliding shells, such cancellation
cannot occur if the field is not perfectly aligned. Here, this result is
extended to the case of two asymmetric shells. The filamentation instability
appears therefore as an increasingly robust mechanism to generate shocks.

potential for forming one or more planets of various masses is essentially
driven by the initial mass of the disks. We present and analyze Herschel/PACS
observations of disk-bearing M-type stars that belong to the young ~2 Myr old
Chamaleon-I star forming region. We used the radiative transfer code RADMC to
successfully model the SED of 17 M-type stars detected at PACS wavelengths. We
first discuss the relatively low detection rates of M5 and later spectral type
stars with respect to the PACS sensitivity, and argue their disks masses, or
flaring indices, are likely to be low. For M0 to M3 stars, we find a relatively
broad range of disk masses, scale heights, and flaring indices. Via a
parametrization of dust stratification, we can reproduce the peak fluxes of the
10 $\mu$m emission feature observed with Spitzer/IRS, and find that disks
around M-type stars may display signs of dust sedimentation. The Herschel/PACS
observations of low-mass stars in Cha-I provide new constraints on their disk
properties, overall suggesting that disk parameters for early M-type stars are
comparable to those for more massive stars (e.g., comparable scale height and
flaring angles). However, regions of the disks emitting at about 100 $\mu$m may
still be in the optically thick regime, preventing direct determination of disk
masses. Thus the modeled disk masses should be considered as lower limits.
Still, we are able to extend the wavelength coverage of SED models and start
characterizing effects such as dust sedimentation, an effort leading the way
towards ALMA observations of these low-mass stars.

Both NGC 2808 and omega Cen are massive globular clusters exhibiting complex
stellar populations and large numbers of extreme horizontal branch stars. Our
far-UV photometric monitoring of over 100 hot evolved stars has revealed six
pulsating subdwarfs with periods ranging from 85 to 149 s and UV amplitudes of
2.0 to 6.8%. In the UV color-magnitude diagram of NGC 2808, all six of these

by the subluminous ""blue-hook"" stars. For three of these six pulsators, we also
have low-resolution far-UV spectroscopy that is sufficient to broadly constrain
their atmospheric abundances and effective temperatures. Curiously, and in
contrast to the omega Cen pulsators, the NGC 2808 pulsators do not exhibit the
spectroscopic or photometric uniformity one might expect from a well-defined

exact significance of this detection is sensitive to the true characterization
of Chandra's point spread function. The observed excess in the surface
brightness profiles is suggestive of lower extended emission in AGN hosts
compared to normal galaxies. This is qualitatively similar to theoretical
predictions of the X-ray surface brightness profile from AGN feedback models,
where feedback from AGN is likely to evacuate the gas from the center of the

Kepler, while pulsations in more evolved M giants have been studied with
ground-based microlensing surveys. After 3.1 years of observation with Kepler,
it is now possible to make a link between these different observations of
semi-regular variables. We aim to identify period-luminosity sequences in
evolved red giants identified as semi-regular variables. Then, we investigate
the consequences of the comparison of ground-based and space-borne
observations. We have first measured global oscillation parameters of evolved
red giants observed with Kepler with the envelope autocorrelation function
method. We then used an extended form of the universal red giant oscillation
pattern, extrapolated to very low frequency, to fully identify their
oscillations. From the link between red giant oscillations observed by Kepler
and period-luminosity sequences, we have identified these relations in evolved
red giants as radial and non-radial solar-like oscillations. We were able to
expand scaling relations at very low frequency. This helped us to identify the
different sequences of period-luminosity relations, and allowed us to propose a
calibration of the K magnitude with the observed frequency large separation.
Interpreting period-luminosity relations in red giants in terms of solar-like
oscillations allows us to investigate, with a firm physical basis, the time
series obtained from ground-based microlensing surveys. This can be done with
an analytical expression that describes the low-frequency oscillation spectra.
The different behavior of oscillations at low frequency, with frequency
separations scaling only approximately with the square root of the mean stellar
density, can be used to address precisely the physics of the semi-regular
variables.

in the context of RPV SUSY, the possibility to generate the baryon asymmetry
through the out-of-equilibrium decay of a metastable Weakly Interacting Massive
Particle (WIMP), as proposed in \cite{Cui:2012jh}. This setting is also
motivated by the observed coincidence between the abundances of dark and
baryonic matter. In this framework, we propose two models of out-of-equilibrium
decay of a would-be cold relic, and compute the associated CP asymmetry. With a
TeV-scale parent, the observed baryon abundance can be reproduced in these
models when the stop is in the multi-TeV region. Furthermore, annihilation of
the metastable particle into SM states must be characterised by a very weak
coupling, $g\sim 10^{-2}$ and by a heavy mediator $m_{med}\sim 10$ TeV. These
models can also accommodate stop masses far from the TeV scale, at the expense
of weakening the explanation of the $\Omega_{B}-\Omega_{DM}$ coincidence.

that there is no security parameter in such protocols and it is not the case

distance criterion $d\leq\epsilon$, which is widely claimed in the technical

ramification on achievable security levels. It will be shown how the error
correction problem alone may already defy rigorous quantitative analysis.
Various other problems would be touched upon. It is pointed out that rigorous
security guarantee of much more efficient quantum cryptosystems may be obtained
by abandoning the disturbance-information tradeoff principle and utilizing
instead the known KCQ (keyed communication in quantum noise) principle in
conjunction with a new DBM (decoy bits method) principle that will be detailed

few 10^-5 G and coherence lengths larger than 10 kpc in typical galaxies like
the Milky Way. We propose that the magnetic field was amplified to this values
already during the formation and the early evolution of the galaxies.
Turbulence in young galaxies is driven by accretion as well as by supernova
(SN) explosions of the first generation of stars. The small-scale dynamo can
convert the turbulent kinetic energy into magnetic energy and amplify very weak
primordial magnetic seed fields on short timescales. The amplification takes
place in two phases: in the kinematic phase the magnetic field grows
exponentially, with the largest growth on the smallest non-resistive scale. In
the following non-linear phase the magnetic energy is shifted towards larger
scales until the dynamo saturates on the turbulent forcing scale. To describe
the amplification of the magnetic field quantitatively we model the
microphysics in the interstellar medium (ISM) of young galaxies and determine
the growth rate of the small-scale dynamo. We estimate the resulting saturation
field strengths and dynamo timescales for two turbulent forcing mechanisms:
accretion-driven turbulence and SN-driven turbulence. We compare them to the
field strength that is reached, when only stellar magnetic fields are
distributed by SN explosions. We find that the small-scale dynamo is much more
efficient in magnetizing the ISM of young galaxies. In the case of
accretion-driven turbulence a magnetic field strength of the order of 10^-6 G
is reached after a time of 24-270 Myr, while in SN-driven turbulence the dynamo
saturates at field strengths of typically 10^-5 G after only 4-15 Myr. This is
considerably shorter than the Hubble time. Our work can help to understand why
present-day galaxies are highly magnetized.

Pauli's principle. It has been recently shown that this practice jeopardizes
multi-reference (MR) EDF calculations by contaminating the energy with spurious
self-interactions that, for example, lead to finite steps or even divergences
when plotting it as a function of collective coordinates. As of today, the only
viable option to bypass these pathologies is to rely on EDF kernels that
enforce Pauli's principle from the outset by strictly and exactly deriving from
a genuine, i.e. density-independent, Hamilton operator.
  We wish to develop the most general Skyrme-like EDF parametrization
containing linear, bilinear and trilinear terms in the density matrices with up
to two gradients, under the key constraint that it derives strictly from an
effective Hamilton operator. The most general three-body Skyrme-like
pseudo-potential containing up to two gradient operators is constructed to
generate the trilinear part. The present study is limited to central terms.

the hadrons there are additional partons - tensor-gluons, which can carry a
part of the proton momentum. The tensor-gluons have zero electric charge, like
gluons, but have a larger spin. Inside the proton a nonzero density of the
tensor-gluons can be generated by the emission of tensor-gluons by gluons. The
last mechanism is typical for non-Abelian tensor gauge theories, in which there
exists a gluon-tensor-tensor vertex of order g. Therefore the number of gluons
changes not only because a quark may radiate a gluon or because a gluon may
split into a quark-antiquark pair or into two gluons, but also because a gluon
can split into two tensor-gluons. The process of gluon splitting suggests that
part of the proton momentum which was carried by neutral partons is shared
between vector and tensor gluons. We derive evolution equations for the parton
distribution functions which take into account these new processes. The
momentum sum rule allows to find the tensor-gluons contribution to the
Callan-Simanzik beta function and to calculate the corresponding anomalous
dimensions. This contribution changes the behavior of the structure functions,
and the logarithmic correction to the Bjorken scaling becomes more mild. This
also influences the unification scale at which the coupling constants of the
Standard Model merge, shifting its value to lower energies of order of 40 TeV.

Here, we study the sensitivity of such a seismic network to structural
heterogeneity in a 2-D setting. We compute finite-frequency cross-correlation
sensitivity kernels for travel-time, waveform-energy and waveform-difference
measurements. In line with expectation, wavespeed anomalies are best imaged
using travel times and the source distribution using cross-correlation
energies. Perturbations in attenuation and impedance are very difficult to
image and reliable inferences require a high degree of certainty in the
knowledge of the source distribution and wavespeed model (at least in the case
of transmission tomography studied here). We perform single-step Gauss-Newton
inversions for the source distribution and the wavespeed, in that order, and
quantify the associated Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound. The inversion and
uncertainty estimate are robust to errors in the source model but are sensitive
to the theory used to interpret of measurements. We find that when classical
source-receiver kernels are used instead of cross-correlation kernels, errors
appear in the both the inversion and uncertainty estimate, systematically
biasing the results. We outline a computationally tractable algorithm to
account for distant sources when performing inversions.

from ~10^5 Msun BHs formed in the 'direct collapse' of pristine, atomic-cooling
(temperatures T ~ 8000 K; PAC) gas that did not fragment to form ordinary stars
due to a lack of molecular hydrogen and metals. We propose that baryonic
streaming---the relic relative motion of gas with respect to dark matter from
cosmological recombination---provides a natural mechanism for establishing the
conditions necessary for direct collapse. This effect delays the formation of
the first stars by inhibiting the infall of gas into dark matter haloes;
streaming velocities more than twice the root-mean-square value could forestall
star formation until halo virial temperatures Tvir ~ 8000 K. The resulting PAC
gas can proceed to form massive BHs by any of the mechanisms proposed in the
literature to induce direct collapse in the absence of a ultraviolet
background. This scenario produces haloes containing PAC gas at a
characteristic redshift z ~ 30. It can explain the abundance of the most
luminous quasars at z = 6, regardless of whether direct collapse occurs in
nearly all or less than 1 per cent of PAC haloes.

receiver and genie-aided maximum-likelihood (ML) receiver. It is shown that the
conventional static approach based on static parameterization, while working
well under moderate and weak interference conditions, fails to generate a
well-behaved solution in the strong interference case. Inspired by this
observation, we propose a new adaptive approach where the combining parameter
is adaptively adjusted according to instantaneous interference-to-signal ratio
(ISR). The basic idea is to exploit the probabilistic behavior of the optimal
combining ratio over the ISR. The link-level simulation results are provided to
verify the prediction accuracy of the proposed link abstraction method.
Moreover, we use the proposed link abstraction model as a link-to-system
interface mapping in system-level simulations to demonstrate the performance of
the IAC receiver in interference-limited LTE systems

(SDSS) data, and there is substantial evidence that they are generally galaxies
with highly obscured central engines, in accord with unified models for active
galactic nuclei (AGNs). A straightforward expectation of unified models is that
highly obscured Type 2 AGNs should show little or no optical variability on
timescales of days to years. As a test of this prediction, we have carried out
a search for variability in Type 2 quasars in SDSS Stripe 82 using
difference-imaging photometry. Starting with the Type 2 AGN catalogs of
Zakamska et al. (2003) and Reyes et al. (2008), we find evidence of significant
g-band variability in 17 out of 173 objects for which light curves could be
measured from the Stripe 82 data. To determine the nature of this variability,
we obtained new Keck spectropolarimetry observations for seven of these
variable AGNs. The Keck data show that these objects have low continuum
polarizations (p<~1% in most cases) and all seven have broad H-alpha and/or
MgII emission lines in their total (unpolarized) spectra, indicating that they
should actually be classified as Type 1 AGNs. We conclude that the primary
reason variability is found in the SDSS-selected Type 2 AGN samples is that
these samples contain a small fraction of Type 1 AGNs as contaminants, and it
is not necessary to invoke more exotic possible explanations such as a
population of ""naked"" or unobscured Type 2 quasars. Aside from misclassified
Type 1 objects, the Type 2 quasars do not generally show detectable optical
variability over the duration of the Stripe 82 survey.

energy distribution is ambiguous in the literature; whether the stellar mass
includes the mass of the stellar remnants, i.e. white dwarfs, neutron stars,
and black holes, is not well described. The remnant mass fraction in the total
(living+remnant) stellar mass of a simple stellar population monotonically
increases with the age of the population, and the initial mass function and
metallicity affect the increasing rate. Since galaxies are composed of a number
of stellar populations, the remnant mass fraction may depend on the total
stellar mass of galaxies in a complex way. As a result, the shape of the
stellar mass function of galaxies may change, depending on the definition of
the stellar mass. In order to explore this issue, we ran a cosmological
hydrodynamical simulation, and then, we have found that the remnant mass
fraction indeed correlates with the total stellar mass of galaxies. However,
this correlation is weak and the remnant fraction can be regarded as a constant
which depends only on the redshift. Therefore, the shape of the stellar mass
function is almost unchanged, but it simply shifts horizontally if the remnant
mass includes or not. The shift is larger at lower redshift and it reaches
0.2-dex at z=0 for a Chabrier IMF. Since this causes a systematic difference,
we should take care of the definition of the `stellar' mass, when comparing
one's result with others.

quasi-one-dimensional spin-1/2 Heisenberg model coupled to adiabatic bond
phonons is investigated using the Stochastic Series Expansion (SSE) Quantum
Monte Carlo (QMC) method. The quantum phase transition from a gapless Neel
state to a spin-gapped Peierls state is studied in the parameter space spanned
by spatial anisotropy, inter-chain coupling strength and spin-lattice coupling
strength. It is found that for any finite inter-chain coupling, the transition
to a dimerized Peierls ground state only occurs when the spin-lattice coupling
exceeds a finite, non-zero critical value. This is in contrast to the pure 1D
model (zero inter-chain coupling), where adiabatic/classical phonons lead to a
dimerized ground state for any non-zero spin-phonon interaction. The phase
diagram in the parameter space shows that for a strong inter-chain coupling,
the relation between the inter-chain coupling and the critical value of the
spin-phonon interaction is linear whereas for weak inter-chain coupling, this
behavior is found to have a natural logarithm-like relation. No region was
found to have a long range magnetic order and dimerization occurring
simultaneously. Instead, the Neel state order vanishes simultaneously with the
setting in of the spin-Peierls state. For the thermal phase transition, a
continuous heat capacity with a peak at the critical temperature, $T_{c}$,
shows a second order phase transition. The variation of the equilibrium bond
length distortion, $\delta_{eq}$, with temperature showed a power law relation
which decayed to zero as the temperature was increased to $T_{c}$, indicating a
continuous transition from the dimerized phase to a paramagnetic phase with
uniform bond length and zero antiferromagnetic susceptibility.

exposed on the outside, and intermediate states are observed in their binding
processes. We consider that stepwise target recognition via intermediate states
is a characteristic of IDP binding to targets with ""hidden"" binding sites. To
investigate IDP binding to hidden target binding sites, we constructed an IDP
lattice model based on the HP model. In our model, the IDP is modeled as a
chain and the target is modeled as a highly coarse-grained object. We
introduced motion and internal interactions to the target to hide its binding
sites. In the case of unhidden binding sites, a two-state transition between
the free states and a bound state is observed, and we consider that this
represents coupled folding and binding. Introducing hidden binding sites, we
found an intermediate bound state in which the IDP forms various structures to
temporarily stabilize the complex. The intermediate state provides a scaffold
for the IDP to access the hidden binding site. We call this process multiform
binding. We conclude that structural flexibility of IDPs enables them to access
hidden binding sites, and this is a functional advantage of IDPs.

Contrary to the usual way of solving the problem in the dual space, we look at
the optimization from a new perspective. By conducting Fourier transform on the
Gaussian kernel, we explicitly compute the mapping function, which leads to a
more straightforward solution of the problem in the primal space. Furthermore,
we impose the mixed $L_{21}$ norm constraint on the kernel weights, known as
the group lasso regularization, to enforce group sparsity among different
feature modalities. This actually acts as a role of feature modality selection,
while at the same time exploiting complementary information among different
kernels. Therefore it is able to extract the most discriminative features for
classification. Experiments on the ADNI data set demonstrate the effectiveness

recommender system and which is not. Important data is data that contributes
most to the accuracy of the recommendation algorithm, while less important data
contributes less to the accuracy or even decreases it. Characterizing the
importance of data has two potential direct benefits: (1) increased privacy and
(2) reduced data management costs, including storage. For privacy, we enable
increased recommendation accuracy for comparable privacy levels using existing
data obfuscation techniques. For storage, our results indicate that we can
achieve large reductions in recommendation data and yet maintain recommendation
accuracy.
  Our main technique is called differential data analysis. The name is inspired
by other sorts of differential analysis, such as differential power analysis
and differential cryptanalysis, where insight comes through analysis of
slightly differing inputs. In differential data analysis we chunk the data and
compare results in the presence or absence of each chunk. We present results
applying differential data analysis to two datasets and three different kinds
of attributes. The first attribute is called user hardship. This is a novel
attribute, particularly relevant to location datasets, that indicates how
burdensome a data point was to achieve. The second and third attributes are
more standard: timestamp and user rating. For user rating, we confirm previous
work concerning the increased importance to the recommender of data
corresponding to high and low user ratings.

optimization problems that unify geometric programs (GPs) and conic
optimization problems such as semidefinite programs (SDPs). A CGP consists of a
linear objective function that is to be minimized subject to affine
constraints, convex conic constraints, and upper bound constraints on sums of
exponential and affine functions. The conic constraints are the central feature
of conic programs such as SDPs, while upper bounds on combined
exponential/affine functions are generalizations of the types of constraints
found in GPs. The dual of a CGP involves the maximization of the negative
relative entropy between two nonnegative vectors jointly, subject to affine and
conic constraints on the two vectors. Although CGPs contain GPs and SDPs as
special instances, computing global optima of CGPs is not much harder than
solving GPs and SDPs. More broadly, the CGP framework facilitates a range of
new applications that fall outside the scope of SDPs and GPs. Specifically, we
demonstrate the utility of CGPs in providing solutions to problems such as
permanent maximization, hitting-time estimation in dynamical systems, the
computation of the capacity of channels transmitting quantum information, and

false-positive range. In this situation the performance of a detector should be
assessed on the basis of the area under the ROC curve over that range, rather
than over the full curve, as the performance outside the range is irrelevant.
  This measure is labelled as the partial area under the ROC curve (pAUC).
Effective cascade-based classification, for example, depends on training node
classifiers that achieve the maximal detection rate at a moderate false
positive rate, e.g., around 40% to 50%. We propose a novel ensemble learning
method which achieves a maximal detection rate at a user-defined range of false
positive rates by directly optimizing the partial AUC using structured
learning. By optimizing for different ranges of false positive rates, the
proposed method can be used to train either a single strong classifier or a
node classifier forming part of a cascade classifier. Experimental results on
both synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach, and we show that it is possible to train state-of-the-art pedestrian
detectors using the proposed structured ensemble learning method.

reliable way for checking the correctness of memory operations in programs.
This works in an unintrusive way where Valgrind translates the program into
intermediate code and executes it on an emulated CPU. The heavy weight tool
Memcheck uses this to keep a full shadow copy of the memory used by a program
and tracking accesses to it. This allows the detection of memory leaks and
checking the validity of accesses.
  Though suited for a wide variety of programs, this approach still fails when
accelerator based programming models are involved. The code running on these
devices is separate from the code running on the host. Access to memory on the
device and starting of kernels is being handled by an API provided by the
driver being used. Hence Valgrind is unable to understand and instrument
operations being run on the device.
  To circumvent this limitation a new set of wrapper functions have been
introduced. These wrap a subset of the CUDA Driver API function that is
responsible for (de-)allocation memory regions on the device and the respective
memory copy operations. This allows to check whether memory is fully allocated
during a transfer and, through the functionality provided by Valgrind, whether
the memory transfered to the device from the host is defined and addressable.
Through this technique it is possible to detect a number of common programming
mistakes, which are very difficult to debug by other means. The combination of
these wrappers together with the Valgrind tool Memcheck is being called
Cudagrind.

spin in an arbitrary frame by using the classical spin dipole tensor, which
gives the covariant spin dipole interactions, and the relation between a spin
and a spin magnetic dipole moment. The relativistic spin is shown to have
problems to become a proper spin operator for a massive relativistic particle
because of two reasons. First, the relativistic spin three-vector operators
cannot satisfy the spin algebra. Second, the SG experiment for the relativistic
particle provides a paradox between two observers in the particle rest frame
and the laboratory frame, in which the particle is moving. We have shown that
the paradox in the SG experiment is resolved by the Dirac spin, which is
covariantly defined by a Lorentz transformation in the Dirac spinor
representation. The Dirac spin three-vector operators satisfy the spin algebra.
It is shown that the SG experiment for the Dirac spin in the inertial frame,
where there is only magnetic field, can determine the spin without the
information of the momentum of the particle.
  This shows that the reduced spin density matrix for the Dirac particle can be
well-defined by integrating out the momentum degrees of freedom.

first present the peculiar features of the 2:3 Neptune mean motion resonance

amplitude A_{\sigma} with inclination i. Using the numerical integrations for
the age of the Solar system, the dynamical structure of the 2:3 NMMR is mapped
out on the plane of semi-major axis versus i for different eccentricities. We
have shown that i of stable resonant orbits could be as high as 90 deg; and the
stable region is roughly surrounded by the contours of A_{\sigma} = 120 deg.
These new findings allow us to further explore the 2:3 NMMR capture and
retention of planetesimals with initial inclinations i0 =< 90 deg in the frame
of the planet migration model. We find that the outward transportation of
Plutinos is possible for any inclined or even perpendicular orbits.
  The role of i0 in the formation of Plutinos during Neptune's migration is
highlighted and interesting results are obtained: (1) The capture efficiency of
the 2:3 NMMR decreases drastically first with the increase of i0, but it then
raises instead when i0 exceeds ~ 50 deg; (2) The magnitude of i-variation is
limited to less than 5 deg for any i0, and moreover, for Plutinos with i > 48
deg, their i are forced to decrease throughout the outward migration; (3)
Plutinos with i > 48 deg are certainly outside the Kozai mechanism, since an
inclination increase is prohibited by the migrating 2:3 NMMR; (4) The 7:11
inclination-type NMMR could be responsible for nearly-circular Plutinos, and a
minimum i0 ~ 15 deg is required to intrigue this mechanism.

make some interesting extensions to the original formulation. We show that
Conrad's framework is equivalent to minmization of the expected value of the
damage function under the stochastic optimal stopping rule. We extend Conrad's
model by allowing for policy cost to grow with time. In addition to closed form
solution, we also perform Monte Carlo simulations to find the distribution for
the total damage and show that at higher quantiles the damage may become too
large and so is the risk on the global economy. We also show that the decision
to take action largely depends on the cost of the action. For example, in the
case of model parameters calibrated as in Conrad (1997) with a constant cost,
there is a rather long wait before the action is expected to be taken, but if
the cost increases with the same rate as the global economy growth, then action
has to be taken immediately to minimize the damage.

  Monte Carlo",,"MODSIM2013, pp. 134-140",,,"physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a three-dimensional magnetic field produced by an arbitrary
collection of dipoles. Assuming the magnetic vector or its gradient tensor
field is measured above the earth surface, the inverse problem is to use the
measurement data to find the location, strength, orientation and distribution
of the dipoles underneath the surface. We propose a reversible jump Markov
chain Monte Carlo (RJ-MCMC) algorithm for both the magnetic vector and its
gradient tensor to deal with this trans-dimensional inverse problem where the
number of unknowns is one of the unknowns. A special birth-death move strategy
is designed to obtain a reasonable rate of acceptance for the RJ-MCMC sampling.
  Some preliminary results show the strength and challenges of the algorithm in
inverting the magnetic measurement data through dipoles. Starting with an
arbitrary single dipole, the algorithm automatically produces a cloud of
dipoles to reproduce the observed magnetic field, and the true dipole
distribution for a bulky object is better predicted than for a thin object.
Multi-objects located at different depths remain a very challenging inverse
problem.

commutative ring A, and we face the problem of the characterization for the
family Mf(J) of all homogeneous ideals I in P such that the A-module P/I is
free with basis given by the set of terms in the Groebner escalier N(J) of J.
This family is in general wider than that of the ideals having J as initial
ideal w.r.t. any term-ordering, hence more suited to a computational approach
to the study of Hilbert schemes. For this purpose, we exploit and enhance the
concepts of multiplicative variables, complete sets and involutive bases
introduced by Janet and we generalize the construction of J-marked bases and
term-ordering free reduction process introduced and deeply studied for the
special case of a strongly stable monomial ideal J. Here, we introduce and
characterize for every monomial ideal J a particular complete set of generators
F(J), called stably complete, that allows an explicit description of the family
Mf(J). We obtain stronger results if J is quasi stable, proving that F(J) is a
Pommaret basis and Mf(J) has a natural structure of affine scheme. The final
section presents a detailed analysis of the origin and the historical evolution

noble metal surfaces Pt(321), Au(321) and Ag(321) is studied by Density
Functional Theory calculations. We use the oPBE-vdW functional which includes
van der Waals forces on an ab initio level. It is shown that the molecule binds
via its carboxyl and the hydroxyl oxygen atoms to the surface. The binding
energy is larger on Pt(321) and Ag(321) than on Au(321). An analysis of the
contributions to the binding energy of the different molecular functional
groups reveals that the deprotonated carboxyl group contributes most to the
binding energy, with a much smaller contribution of the hydroxyl group. The
Pt(321) surface shows considerable enantioselectivity of 0.06 eV. On Au(321)
and Ag(321) it is much smaller if not vanishing. The chiral selectivity of the
Pt(321) surface can be explained by two factors. First, it derives from the
difference in van der Waals attraction of L- and D-lactate to the surface that
we trace to differences in the binding energy of the methyl group. Second, the
multi-point binding pattern for lactate on the Pt(321) surface is sterically
more sensitive to surface chirality and also leads to large binding energy
contributions of the hydroxyl group. We also calculate the charge transfer to
the molecule and the work function to gauge changes in electronic structure of
the adsorbed molecule. The work function is lowered by 0.8 eV on Pt(321) with
much smaller changes on Au(321) and Ag(321).

only the operations belonging to a certain restricted set are efficiently
simulable classically. Since some of the operations in this set generate
entangled states, it is commonly concluded that entanglement is insufficient to
enable quantum computers to outperform classical computers. I argue in this
paper that this conclusion is misleading. First, the statement of the theorem
(that the particular set of quantum operations in question can be simulated
using a classical computer) is, on reflection, already evident when we consider
Bell's and related inequalities in the context of a discussion of computational
machines. This, in turn, helps us to understand that the appropriate conclusion
to draw from the Gottesman-Knill theorem is not that entanglement is
insufficient to enable a quantum performance advantage, but rather that if we
limit ourselves to the operations referred to in the Gottesman-Knill theorem,
we will not have used the resources provided by an entangled quantum system to
their full potential.

are removed from the Hessian by following their eigenvectors downhill, one is
left with only positive and zero eigenvalues. Zero modes correspond to orbital
rotations with no restoring force. These rotations determine states in the
Goldstone manifold, which originates from a spontaneously broken continuous
symmetry in the wave function. Zero modes can be classified as improper or
proper according to their different mathematical and physical properties.
Improper modes arise from symmetry breaking and their restoration always lowers
the energy. Proper modes, on the other hand, correspond to degeneracies of the
wave function, and their symmetry restoration does not necessarily lower the
energy. We discuss how the RPA Hamiltonian distinguishes between proper and
improper modes by doubling the number of zero eigenvalues associated with the
latter. Proper modes in the Hessian always appear in pairs which do not double
in RPA. We present several pedagogical cases exemplifying the above statements.

profile is found to be strongly energy-dependent: a complex, multi-peaked
structure at low energy that becomes a simple single peak at higher energy. We
found that the 1-70 keV pulse averaged continuum can be fitted by the sum of a
black body and a partial covering Negative and Positive power-law with
EXponential cutoff (NPEX) model. A weak iron fluorescence emission line at 6.4
keV was detected in the spectrum. An absorption like feature at ~44 keV was
clearly seen in the residue of the spectral fitting, independent of the
continuum model adopted. To check the possible presence of a CRSF in the
spectrum, we normalized the pulsar spectrum with the spectrum of the Crab
Nebula. The resulting Crab ratio also showed a clear dip centered at ~44 keV.
We performed statistical tests on the residue of the spectral fitting and also
on the Crab spectral ratio to determine the significance of the absorption like
feature and identified it as a CRSF of the pulsar. We estimated the

depends strongly on their speed class, with dust typically taking longer to
form in slower novae. Using empirical relationships between speed class,
luminosity and ejection velocity, it can be shown that dust formation timescale
is expected to be essentially independent of speed class. However, following a
nova outburst the spectrum of the central hot source evolves, with an
increasing proportion of the radiation being emitted short-ward of the Lyman
limit. The rate at which the spectrum evolves also depends on the speed class.
We have therefore refined the simple model by assuming photons at energies
higher than the Lyman limit are absorbed by neutral hydrogen gas internal to
the dust formation sites, therefore preventing these photons reaching the
nucleation sites. With this refinement the dust formation timescale is
theoretically dependent on speed class and the results of our theoretical
modification agree well with the observational data. We consider two types of
carbon-based dust, graphite and amorphous carbon, with both types producing
similar relationships. Our results can be used to predict when dust will form
in a nova of a given speed class and hence when observations should optimally
be taken to detect the onset of dust formation.

It leads to not only Fredholm solvability statements but also regularity

  Processing",,,,,"cs.CG math.MG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper introduces three sets of sufficient conditions, for generating
bijective simplicial mappings of manifold meshes. A necessary condition for a
simplicial mapping of a mesh to be injective is that it either maintains the
orientation of all elements or flips all the elements. However, these
conditions are known to be insufficient for injectivity of a simplicial map. In
this paper we provide additional simple conditions that, together with the
above mentioned necessary conditions guarantee injectivity of the simplicial
map.
  The first set of conditions generalizes classical global inversion theorems
to the mesh (piecewise-linear) case. That is, proves that in case the boundary
simplicial map is bijective and the necessary condition holds then the map is
injective and onto the target domain. The second set of conditions is concerned
with mapping of a mesh to a polytope and replaces the (often hard) requirement
of a bijective boundary map with a collection of linear constraints and
guarantees that the resulting map is injective over the interior of the mesh
and onto. These linear conditions provide a practical tool for optimizing a map
of the mesh onto a given polytope while allowing the boundary map to adjust
freely and keeping the injectivity property in the interior of the mesh. The
third set of conditions adds to the second set the requirement that the
boundary maps are orientation preserving as-well (with a proper definition of
boundary map orientation). This set of conditions guarantees that the map is
injective on the boundary of the mesh as-well as its interior. Several
experiments using the sufficient conditions are shown for mapping triangular
meshes.
  A secondary goal of this paper is to advocate and develop the tool of degree
in the context of mesh processing.

WMG-preconditioned Krylov method is analyzed through a spectral analysis, and
the approach is compared to existing methods like the classical Simultaneous
Iterative Reconstruction Technique (SIRT) and unpreconditioned Krylov methods
on a 2D tomographic benchmark problem. Numerical experiments are promising,
showing the method to be competitive with the classical Algebraic
Reconstruction Techniques in terms of convergence speed and overall performance

class of perturbative models involving elementary scalars is the one in which
the theory simultaneously satisfies the Veltman conditions and is conformal at
the classical level. We term these extensions perturbative natural conformal
(PNC) theories. We show that PNC models are very constrained and thus highly
predictive. Among the several PNC examples that we exhibit, we discover a
remarkably simple PNC extension of the standard model in which the Higgs is
predicted to have the experimental value of the mass equal to 126 GeV. This
model also predicts the existence of one more standard model singlet scalar
boson with a mass of 541 GeV and the Higgs self-coupling to emerge radiatively.
We study several other PNC examples that generally predict a somewhat smaller
mass of the Higgs to the perturbative order we have investigated them. Our
results can be a useful guide when building extensions of the standard model
featuring fundamental scalars.

powerful attraction on its counterions that a certain fraction condenses onto
the surface of a particle. The degree of condensation depends on the curvature
of the surface. So, for instance, condensation is triggered on a highly-charged
sphere only if the radius exceeds a certain critical radius $\collrad^{*}$.
$\collrad^{*}$ is expected to be a simple function of the volume fraction of
particles. To test these predictions, we prepare spherical particles which
contain a covalently-bound ionic liquid, which is engineered to dissociate
efficiently in a low-dielectric medium. By varying the proportion of ionic
liquid to monomer we synthesise nonpolar dispersions of highly-charged spheres
which contain essentially no free co-ions. The only ions in the system are
counterions generated by the dissociation of surface-bound groups. We study the
electrophoretic mobility of this salt-free system as a function of the colloid
volume fraction, the particle radius, and the bare charge density and find
evidence for extensive counterion condensation. At low electric fields, we
observe excellent agreement with Poisson-Boltzmann predictions for counterion
condensation on spheres. At high electric fields however, where ion advection
is dominant, the electrophoretic mobility is enhanced significantly which we
attribute to hydrodynamic stripping of the condensed layer of counterions from

differ from the magnetic edge states caused by skipping cyclotron orbits. The
Tamm states result from breaking of periodic crystal potential at the edge,
they can exist even at zero magnetic field and form a conducting band. Until

technique and there were no direct experiments on their contribution to
transport measurements. Here we present the experiments on Aharonov-Bohm (AB)

interdependent spatially embedded networks to localized geographical attacks.
We find that if an attack is larger than a finite (zero fraction of the system)
critical size, it will spread through the entire system and lead to its
complete collapse. If the attack is below the critical size, it will remain
localized. In contrast, under random attack a finite fraction of the system
needs to be removed to initiate system collapse. We present both numerical

The approach is based on dissipative particle dynamics. While the model is
potentially applicable to a wide range of self-propelled particle systems, the
specific class of self-motile bacterial suspensions is considered as a modeling
scenario. To mimic the rod-like geometry of a bacterium, two dissipative
particle dynamics particles are connected by a stiff harmonic spring to form an
aggregate dissipative particle dynamics molecule. Bacterial motility is modeled
through a constant self-propulsion force applied along the axis of each such
aggregate molecule. The model accounts for hydrodynamic interactions between
self-propelled agents through the pairwise dissipative interactions
conventional to dissipative particle dynamics. Numerical simulations are
performed using a customized version of the open-source LAMMPS (Large-scale
Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator) software package. Detailed
studies of the influence of agent concentration, pairwise dissipative
interactions, and Stokes friction on the statistics of the system are provided.
The simulations are used to explore the influence of hydrodynamic interactions
in active suspensions. For high agent concentrations in combination with
dominating pairwise dissipative forces, strongly correlated motion patterns and
a fluid-like spectral distributions of kinetic energy are found. In contrast,
systems dominated by Stokes friction exhibit weaker spatial correlations of the
velocity field. These results indicate that hydrodynamic interactions may play

relatively young AR is 2-3. This modest FIP bias is a consequence of the AR
age, its weak heating, and its partial reconnection with the surrounding CH.
Plasma with a coronal composition is concentrated at AR loop footpoints, close
to where fractionation is believed to take place in the chromosphere. In the
AR, we found a moderate positive correlation of FIP bias with nonthermal

contributes in terms of anti-shadowing enhancement and shadowing suppression;
however, the enhancement seen at backward rapidity exceeds expectations from
this effect alone. These results, implying an important role for additional

free energy of all experimentally known ice phases has been calculated with the
flexible q-TIP4P/F model of water. The only exception is the high pressure ice
X, in which the presence of symmetric O-H-O bonds prevents its modeling with
this empirical interatomic potential. The simplicity of our approach allows us
to study ice phases at state points of the T-P plane that have been omitted in
previous simulations using free energy methods based on thermodynamic
integration. The effect in the phase diagram of averaging the proton disorder
that appears in several ice phases has been studied. It is found particularly
relevant for ice III, at least for cell sizes typically used in phase
coexistence simulations. New insight into the capability of the employed water
model to describe the coexistence of ice phases is presented. We find that the
H-ordered ices IX and XIV, as well as the H-disordered ice XII, are
particularly stable for this water model. This fact disagrees with experimental
data. The unexpected large stability of ice IX is a property related to the
TIP4P-character of the water model. Only after omission of these three stable
ice phases, the calculated phase diagram becomes in reasonable qualitative
agreement to the experimental one in the T-P region corresponding to ice Ih,
II, III, V, and VI. The calculation of the phase diagram in the quantum and
classical limits shows that the most important quantum effect is the
stabilization of ice II due to its lower zero-point energy when compared to
that one of ices Ih, III, and V.

Martian atmosphere, its thermal structure and circulation. Accordingly, the
inclusion of such effects in the LMD Mars Global Climate Model (GCM) greatly
modifies the simulated Martian water cycle. The intent of this paper is to
address the impact of radiatively active clouds on atmospheric water vapor and
ice in the GCM and improve its representation. We propose a new enhanced
modeling of the water cycle, consisting of detailed cloud microphysics with
dynamic condensation nuclei and a better implementation of perennial surface
water ice. This physical modeling is based on tunable parameters. This new
version of the GCM is compared to the Thermal Emission Spectrometer
observations of the water cycle. Satisfying results are reached for both vapor
and cloud opacities. However, simulations yield a lack of water vapor in the
tropics after Ls=180{\deg} which is persistent in simulations compared to
observations, as a consequence of aphelion cloud radiative effects
strengthening the Hadley cell. Every year, our GCM simulations indicate that
permanent surface water ice on the north polar cap increases at latitudes
higher than 80{\deg}N and decreases at lower latitudes. Supersaturation above
the hygropause is predicted in line with SPICAM observations. The model also
shows for the first time that the scavenging of dust by water ice clouds alone
fails to fully account for observed dust detached layers.

is the problem to decide whether a positive Horn sentence, involving nothing
more than the two quantifiers and conjunction, is true on some fixed structure
$\mathcal{A}$. We study two containment problems related to the QCSP. Firstly,
we give a combinatorial condition on finite structures $\mathcal{A}$ and
$\mathcal{B}$ that is necessary and sufficient to render
$\mathrm{QCSP}(\mathcal{A}) \subseteq \mathrm{QCSP}(\mathcal{B})$. We prove
that $\mathrm{QCSP}(\mathcal{A}) \subseteq \mathrm{QCSP}(\mathcal{B})$, that is
all sentences of positive Horn logic true on $\mathcal{A}$ are true on
$\mathcal{B}$, iff there is a surjective homomorphism from
$\mathcal{A}^{|A|^{|B|}}$ to $\mathcal{B}$. This can be seen as improving an
old result of Keisler that shows the former equivalent to there being a
surjective homomorphism from $\mathcal{A}^\omega$ to $\mathcal{B}$. We note
that this condition is already necessary to guarantee containment of the
$\Pi_2$ restriction of the QCSP, that is $\Pi_2$-$\mathrm{CSP}(\mathcal{A})
\subseteq \Pi_2$-$\mathrm{CSP}(\mathcal{B})$. The exponent's bound of
${|A|^{|B|}}$ places the decision procedure for the model containment problem
in non-deterministic double-exponential time complexity. We further show the
exponent's bound $|A|^{|B|}$ to be close to tight by giving a sequence of
structures $\mathcal{A}$ together with a fixed $\mathcal{B}$, $|B|=2$, such
that there is a surjective homomorphism from $\mathcal{A}^r$ to $\mathcal{B}$
only when $r \geq |A|$. Secondly, we prove that the entailment problem for
positive Horn fragment of first-order logic is decidable. That is, given two
sentences $\varphi$ and $\psi$ of positive Horn, we give an algorithm that
determines whether $\varphi \rightarrow \psi$ is true in all structures
(models). Our result is in some sense tight, since we show that the entailment
problem for positive first-order logic (i.e. positive Horn plus disjunction) is
undecidable. In the final part of the paper we ponder a notion of Q-core that
is some canonical representative among the class of templates that engender the
same QCSP. Although the Q-core is not as well-behaved as its better known
cousin the core, we demonstrate that it is still a useful notion in the realm
of QCSP complexity classifications.

device with a single, static camera, located in the focal plane; no moving of
any component is needed. The method is based on a localized diversity and
differential optical transfer functions (dOTF) to compute both the phase and
amplitude in the pupil plane located upstream of the last imaging optics. An
experiment with a spatial light modulator shows that the calibration is
sufficient to robustly operate a focal-plane wavefront sensing algorithm
controlling a wavefront corrector with ~40 000 degrees of freedom. We estimate
that the locations of identical wavefront corrector elements are determined
with a spatial resolution of 0.3% compared to the pupil diameter.

set-up to support transfer function measurement. Our system is able to
visualize signals of mechanical and electrical resonances and their spectra in
real time. We give a brief description of the system, and show some examples of
electrical and mechanical resonance experiments that are supported by the
system. The theoretical background, experimental set-up, component selection
and digital signal processing are all discussed, and more detailed information
(building instructions, software download) is provided on a dedicated web page
(http://www.noise.inf.u-szeged.hu/edudev/RealTimeAnalysisOfResonances/) The
experimental set-up can support undergraduate and graduate education of
students of physics, physics education and engineering by means of experimental
demonstrations and laboratory exercises. The very low cost, high efficiency and
transparent system provides a scalable experimental environment that can be
easily built in several instances.

generalization of finite asymptotic dimension - asdim. It turns out that this
property can be viewed as transfinite extension of asymptotic dimension. The
original definition was given by Radul. We introduce three equivalent
definitions, show that asymptotic property C is closed under products (open
problem stated ""Open problems in topology II"") and prove some other facts, i.e.
by defining dimension of a family of metric spaces. Some examples of spaces
enjoying countable trasfinite asymptotic dimension are given. We also formulate
open problems and state ""omega conjecture"", which inspired most part of this
paper.

Mean-Time-To-Data-Loss (MTTDL), while suitable for modeling RAID 0 and RAID 5,
fails to accurately model systems having a fault-tolerance greater than 1.
Therefore, to model the reliability of RAID 6, Triple-Replication, or k-of-n
systems requires an alternate technique. In this paper, we explore some
alternatives, and evaluate their efficacy by comparing their predictions to
simulations. Our main result is a new formula which more accurately models
storage system reliability.

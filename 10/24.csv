medium around low-redshift galaxies using a sample of 23 Lyman Limit Systems
(LLSs) at 0.08<z<0.93 observed with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph onboard the
Hubble Space Telescope. In Lehner et al. (2013), we recently showed that low-z
LLSs have a bimodal metallicity distribution. Here we extend that analysis to
search for differences between the high-ion and kinematic properties of the
metal-poor and metal-rich branches. We find that metal-rich LLSs tend to show
higher O VI columns and broader O VI profiles than metal-poor LLSs. The total H
I line width (dv90 statistic) in LLSs is not correlated with metallicity,
indicating that the H I kinematics alone cannot be used to distinguish inflow
from outflow and gas recycling. Among the 17 LLSs with O VI detections, all but
two show evidence of kinematic sub-structure, in the form of O VI-H I centroid
offsets, multiple components, or both. Using various scenarios for how the
metallicity in the high-ion and low-ion phases of each LLS compare, we
constrain the ionized hydrogen column in the O VI phase to lie in the range log
N(H II)~17.6-20. The O VI phase of LLSs is a substantial baryon reservoir, with
M(high-ion)~10^{8.5-10.9}(r/150 kpc)^2 solar masses, similar to the mass in the
low-ion phase. Accounting for the O VI phase approximately doubles the
contribution of low-z LLSs to the cosmic baryon budget.

of nearly circular swimmers in two-dimensional fluids with non-vanishing Hall,

the fluid stress-tensor, which results in a number of striking effects. In
particular, we find that a swimmer whose area is changing will experience a
torque proportional to the rate of change of the area, with the constant of
proportionality given by the coefficient $\eta^o$ of odd viscosity. After
working out the general theory of swimming in fluids with Hall viscosity for a
class of simple swimmers, we give a number of example swimming strokes which
clearly demonstrate the differences between swimming in a fluid with
conventional viscosity and a fluid which also has a Hall viscosity. A number of
more technical results, including a proof of the torque-area relation for

investigated in an eco-evolutionary framework. In our model, we study a finite
population in continuous time, where each individual is characterized by a
trait under selection and a completely linked neutral marker. Population
dynamics are driven by births and deaths, mutations at birth, and competition
between individuals. Trait values influence ecological processes (demographic
events, competition), and competition generates selection on trait variation,
thus closing the eco-evolutionary feedback loop. The demographic effects of the
trait are also expected to influence the generation and maintenance of neutral
variation. We consider a large population limit with rare mutation, under the
assumption that the neutral marker mutates faster than the trait under
selection. We prove the convergence of the stochastic individual-based process
to a new measure-valued diffusive process with jumps that we call Substitution
Fleming-Viot Process (SFVP). When restricted to the trait space this process is
the Trait Substitution Sequence first introduced by Metz et al. (1996). During
the invasion of a favorable mutation, a genetical bottleneck occurs and the
marker associated with this favorable mutant is hitchhiked. By rigorously
analysing the hitchhiking effect and how the neutral diversity is restored
afterwards, we obtain the condition for a time-scale separation; under this
condition, we show that the marker distribution is approximated by a
Fleming-Viot distribution between two trait substitutions. We discuss the
implications of the SFVP for our understanding of the dynamics of neutral
variation under eco-evolutionary feedbacks and illustrate the main phenomena
with simulations. Our results highlight the joint importance of mutations,
ecological parameters, and trait values in the restoration of neutral diversity
after a selective sweep.

since we use a kind of Stieltjes transform of $W$ instead of the Laplace

trivial identity, true for $0\leq u\leq 1/2$:$$_2F_1(2a,2b;a+b+\frac{1}{2};u)=
\_2F_1(a,b;a+b+\frac{1}{2};4u-4u^2).$$ We extend these results to a study of

infinity, interpreting the results in terms of an integral by a Dirichlet
process. We introduce the ideas of Dirichlet semigroups and of Dirichlet
infinite divisibility and characterize these infinite divisible distributions

used to compare the value of dimensionless fundamental constants such as the
fine-structure constant, alpha, and the proton-to-electron mass ratio, mu =
m_p/m_e, as measured in remote regions of the Universe to their value today on
Earth. In recent years, some evidence has emerged of small temporal and also
spatial variations in alpha on cosmological scales which may reach a fractional
level of 10 ppm . We are conducting a Large Programme of observations with VLT
UVES to explore these variations. We here provide a general overview of the
Large Programme and report on the first results for these two constants,
discussed in detail in Molaro et al. and Rahmani et al. A stringent bound for
Delta(alpha)/Alpha is obtained for the absorber at_abs = 1.6919 towards HE
2217-2818. The absorption profile is complex with several very narrow features,
and is modeled with 32 velocity components. The relative variation in alpha in
this system is +1.3+-2.4_{stat}+-1.0_{sys} ppm if Al II lambda 1670AA and three
Fe II transitions are used, and +1.1+-2.6_{stat} ppm in a lightly different
analysis with only Fe II transitions used. The expectation at this sky position
of the recently-reported dipolar variation of alpha is (3.2--5.4)+-1.7 ppm
depending on dipole model. This constraint of Delta(alpha)/alpha at face value
is not supporting this expectation but is not inconsistent with it at the 3
sigma level. For the proton-to-electron mass ratio the analysis of the H_2
absorption lines of the z_{abs}~2.4018 damped Ly alpha system towards HE 0027-
1836 provides Delta(mu)/mu = (-7.6 +- 8.1_{stat} +- 6.3_{sys}) ppm which is
also consistent with a null variation. (abridged)

Then, the dot Majorana side coupled system exhibits a different behavior for
the thermopower depending on the Majorana hybridization parameter. Thermopower
reverses its sign when the half fermionic state is fully developed. As long as
the hybridization becomes finite the Seebeck coefficient behaves similarly to a
resonant level system. The sign change of the thermopower when Majorana physics
takes place and the fact that both, the electrical and thermal conductances

models are found to be most accurate with modal eddy viscosities as proposed by
Rempfer & Fasel (1994). Robustness of the model solution with respect to

considerable classification accuracy, at the same time detects gradual changes

mechanisms about motor function recovery. In this study, we propose an adaptive
boosting algorithm based on the cortex plasticity and spectral band shifts.
This approach models the usually predetermined spatial-spectral configurations
in EEG study into variable preconditions, and introduces a new heuristic of
stochastic gradient boost for training base learners under these preconditions.
We compare our proposed algorithm with commonly used methods on datasets
collected from 2 months' clinical experiments. The simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in detecting the variations of
stroke patients' EEG patterns. By chronologically reorganizing the weight
parameters of the learned additive model, we verify the spatial compensatory
mechanism on impaired cortex and detect the changes of accentuation bands in
spectral domain, which may contribute important prior knowledge for
rehabilitation practice.

restricted to 2 dimensions. In this work we study activity-induced phase
separation in 3D and compare the results with previous and new 2D simulations.
To this end, we performed state-of-the-art Brownian dynamics simulations of up
to 40 million ABPs -- such very large system sizes are unavoidable to evade
finite size effects in 3D. Our results confirm the picture established for 2D
systems in which an activity-induced phase separation occurs, with strong
analogies to equilibrium gas-liquid spinodal decomposition, in spite of the
purely non-equilibrium nature of the driving force behind the phase separation.
However, we also find important differences between the 2D and 3D cases.
Firstly, the shape and position of the phase boundaries is markedly different
for the two cases. Secondly, for the 3D coarsening kinetics we find that the
domain size grows in time according to the classical diffusive $t^{1/3}$ law,
in contrast to the nonstandard subdiffusive exponent observed in 2D.

it retains the phase at 1/4 filling that is induced by an effective positive

chemical-abundance similarities and differences between the M67 stars and the
Sun, and among the M67 stars themselves. Individual abundances of 19 different
chemical elements are obtained for the stars. They are found to agree very well
with solar abundances, with abundance ratios closer to solar than those of most
solar twins in the solar neighbourhood. An exception is Li which shows a
considerable scatter among the cluster stars. There is a tendency for the
cluster-star abundances to be depleted relative to the abundances in the field
stars in correlation with the condensation temperature of the elements, a
tendency earlier found also for the Sun. The results support the hypothesis
that the gas of the proto-cluster was depleted by formation and cleansing of
dust before the stars formed. They also add support to the proposal that the
Sun was once formed in a dense stellar environment. Moreover, the observed
minor reductions of heavy elements in the atmospheres of the dwarfs and
turn-off point stars relative to our standard star M67-1194 and the subgiants

systems. Many of these processors now feature hardware virtualization
capabilities, such as the ARM Cortex A15, and x86 processors with Intel VT-x or
AMD-V support. Hardware virtualization offers opportunities to partition
physical resources, including processor cores, memory and I/O devices amongst
guest virtual machines. Mixed criticality systems and services can then
co-exist on the same platform in separate virtual machines. However,
traditional virtual machine systems are too expensive because of the costs of
trapping into hypervisors to multiplex and manage machine physical resources on
behalf of separate guests. For example, hypervisors are needed to schedule
separate VMs on physical processor cores. In this paper, we discuss the design
of the Quest-V separation kernel, that partitions services of different
criticalities in separate virtual machines, or sandboxes. Each sandbox
encapsulates a subset of machine physical resources that it manages without
requiring intervention of a hypervisor. Moreover, a hypervisor is not needed
for normal operation, except to bootstrap the system and establish

Quest-V is implemented as a ""distributed system on a chip"" and comprises
multiple sandbox kernels. Sandbox kernels are isolated from one another in
separate regions of physical memory, having access to a subset of processing
cores and I/O devices. This partitioning prevents system failures in one
sandbox affecting the operation of other sandboxes. Shared memory channels
managed by system monitors enable inter-sandbox communication.
  The distributed nature of Quest-V means each sandbox has a separate physical

variation of galaxy properties (and their relations), such as color, spectral
type and concentration. Our sample comprises 6,415 galaxies that were
previously selected as cluster members from 152 systems with $z \le 0.100$. Our
main findings are: (i) The fraction of discs is generally higher than the ones
for blue and star-forming galaxies, indicating a faster transformation of color
and star-formation compared to structural parameters. (ii) Regarding the
distance to the cluster center we find a small variation in the galaxy
populations outside the virial radius. Once within that radius the fractions of
each population change fast, decreasing even faster within $R \sim 0.3 \times
R_{200}$. (iii) We also find a small increase in the fraction of blue faint
galaxies within $R \sim 0.4 \times R_{200}$, before decreasing again to the
most central bin. (iv) Our results do not indicate a significant dependence on
cluster mass, except for the disc fraction in the core of clusters. (v) The
relations between galaxy properties also point to no dependence on cluster
mass, except for the scatter of the color stellar mass relation. Our results
corroborate a scenario on which pre-processing in groups leads to a strong
evolution in galaxy properties, before they are accreted by large clusters

solutions to differential equations within non-parametric inference methods.
Unfortunately, the development and application of LFMs can be inhibited by
their computational cost, especially when closed-form solutions for the LFM are
unavailable, as is the case in many real world problems where these latent
forces exhibit periodic behaviour. Given this, we develop a new sparse
representation of LFMs which considerably improves their computational
efficiency, as well as broadening their applicability, in a principled way, to
domains with periodic or near periodic latent forces. Our approach uses a
linear basis model to approximate one generative model for each periodic force.
We assume that the latent forces are generated from Gaussian process priors and
develop a linear basis model which fully expresses these priors. We apply our
approach to model the thermal dynamics of domestic buildings and show that it
is effective at predicting day-ahead temperatures within the homes. We also
apply our approach within queueing theory in which quasi-periodic arrival rates
are modelled as latent forces. In both cases, we demonstrate that our approach
can be implemented efficiently using state-space methods which encode the
linear dynamic systems via LFMs. Further, we show that state estimates obtained
using periodic latent force models can reduce the root mean squared error to
17% of that from non-periodic models and 27% of the nearest rival approach
which is the resonator model.

biological populations and even disrupting causal trade. Epidemiological models
increasingly account for reductions in infectious contact, such as
risk-aversion behaviour in response to pathogen outbreaks. However, market
dynamics clearly differ from simple risk-aversion, as are driven by different
motivation and conditioned by trade constraints, known in economics as
friction, that arise because exchanges are costly. Here we develop a novel
economic-market model where transient and long-term market dynamics are
determined by trade friction and agent adaptation, and can influence disease
transmission. We specify the participants, frequency, volume, and price in
trade transactions, and investigate, using analytical insights and simulation,
how trade friction affects joint market and epidemiological dynamics. The
friction values explored encompass estimates from French cattle and pig
markets. We show that, when trade is the dominant route of transmission, market
friction can be a significantly stronger determinant of epidemics than
risk-aversion behaviour. In particular, there is a critical friction level
above which epidemics do not occur. For a given level of friction, open
unregulated markets can boost epidemics compared with closed or tightly
regulated markets. Our results are robust to model specificities and can hold
in the presence of non-trade disease-transmission routes. In particular, we try
to explain why outbreaks in French livestock markets appear more frequently in
cattle than swine despite swine trade-flow being larger. To minimize contagion
in markets, safety policies could generate incentives for larger-volume,
less-frequent transactions, increasing trade friction without necessarily
affecting overall trade flow.

models in two and higher dimensions. We show that there are dual scaling
functions governing the dynamic scaling, which together describe the scaling
behavior in the entire velocity range $v \in [0, \infty)$. These functions have
asymptotics corresponding to the adiabatic and diabatic limit, and close to
these limits they are perturbative in $v$ and $1/v$, respectively. Away from
their perturbative domains, both functions cross over into the same universal
power-law scaling form governed by the static and dynamic critical exponents
(as well as an exponent characterizing the quench protocol). As a by-product of
the scaling studies, we obtain high-precision estimates of the dynamic exponent
$z$ for the two-dimensional Ising model subject to the three variants of Monte
Carlo dynamics; for single-spin Metropolis updates $z_M=2.1767(5)$, for

interesting behavior with a non-analytic break-down of the quasi-adiabatic and

describe the interior of a black hole in the AdS/CFT correspondence. The
existence of these operators is predicated on the assumption that the mapping
of CFT operators to local bulk operators depends on the state of the CFT. We
show that our construction leads to an exactly local effective field theory in
the bulk. Barring the fact that their charge and energy can be measured at
infinity, we show that the commutator of local operators inside and outside the
black hole vanishes exactly, when evaluated within correlation functions of the
CFT. Our construction leads to a natural resolution of the strong subadditivity
paradox of Mathur and Almheiri et al. Furthermore, we show how, using these
operators, it is possible to reconcile small corrections to effective field
theory correlators with the unitarity of black hole evaporation. We address and
resolve all other arguments, advanced in arxiv:1304.6483 and arxiv:1307.4706,

Economists have traditionally defined risk preferences by the curvature of the
utility function. Psychologists and behavioral economists also make use of
concepts such as loss aversion and probability weighting to model risk
aversion. Neurophysiological evidence suggests that loss aversion has its
origins in relatively ancient neural circuitries (e.g., ventral striatum).
Could there thus be an evolutionary origin to risk avoidance? We study this
question by evolving strategies that adapt to play the equivalent mean payoff
gamble. We hypothesize that risk aversion in the equivalent mean payoff gamble
is beneficial as an adaptation to living in small groups, and find that a
preference for risk averse strategies only evolves in small populations of less
than 1,000 individuals, while agents exhibit no such strategy preference in
larger populations. Further, we discover that risk aversion can also evolve in
larger populations, but only when the population is segmented into small groups
of around 150 individuals. Finally, we observe that risk aversion only evolves
when the gamble is a rare event that has a large impact on the individual's
fitness. These findings align with earlier reports that humans lived in small
groups for a large portion of their evolutionary history. As such, we suggest
that rare, high-risk, high-payoff events such as mating and mate competition
could have driven the evolution of risk averse behavior in humans living in
small groups.

failures and, as a consequence, to a full collapse of the overall system.
Therefore it is important to develop efficient strategies to avoid the collapse

we provide an exact theoretical approach to study the evolution of the cascade
of failures on interdependent networks when a fraction $\alpha$ of the nodes

pattern of interdependency we found, for pair of heterogeneous networks, two
critical percolation thresholds that depend on $\alpha$, separating three

voids. We present a simple analytical expression for the temperature
fluctuation in the CMB across such a lens as a derivative of the lens' Fermat
potential. This formalism is applicable to both linear and nonlinear density
evolution scenarios, to arbitrarily large density contrasts, and to all open
and closed background cosmologies. It is much simpler to use and makes the same
predictions as conventional approaches. In this approach the total temperature
fluctuation can be split into a time-delay part and an evolutionary part. Both
parts must be included for cosmic structures that evolve and both can be
equally important. We present very simple ISW models for cosmic voids and
galaxy clusters to illustrate the ease of use of our formalism. We use the
Fermat potentials of simple cosmic void models to compare predicted ISW effects
with those recently extracted from WMAP and \emph{Planck} data by stacking
large cosmic voids using the aperture photometry method. If voids in the local
universe with large density contrasts are no longer evolving we find that the
time delay contribution alone predicts values consistent with the measurements.
However, we find that for voids still evolving linearly, the evolutionary

derive the general equation of state for galaxies (relation between the

exhibits two regimes: (i) Large diluted galaxies for M_h > 2.3 10^6 Msun

most compact and smallest galaxy (minimal radius and mass M_{h,min}). All
magnitudes in the diluted regime exhibit square root of M_h scaling laws and
are universal functions of r/r_h when normalized to their values at the origin
or at r_h. We find that universality in galaxies (for M_h > 10^6 Msun) reflects
the WDM perfect gas behaviour. These theoretical results contrasted to robust

the small galaxies, 10^6>M_h>M_{h,min} corresponding to effective temperatures
T_0 < 0.017 K, the equation of state is galaxy dependent and the profiles are
no more universal. These non-universal properties in small galaxies account to
the quantum physics of the WDM fermions in the compact regime. Our results are
independent of any WDM particle physics model, they only follow from the

their origin. We investigate the minimum ejecta mass associated with
core-collapse supernovae (SNe) of Type Ic. We show that mass transfer from a
helium star to a compact companion can produce an ultra-stripped core which
undergoes iron core collapse and leads to an extremely fast and faint SN Ic. In
this Letter, a detailed example is presented in which the pre-SN stellar mass
is barely above the Chandrasekhar limit, resulting in the ejection of only
~0.05-0.20 M_sun of material and the formation of a low-mass neutron star. We
compute synthetic light curves of this case and demonstrate that SN 2005ek
could be explained by our model. We estimate that the fraction of such
ultra-stripped to all SNe could be as high as 0.001-0.01. Finally, we argue
that the second explosion in some double neutron star systems (for example, the
double pulsar PSR J0737-3039B) was likely associated with an ultra-stripped SN
Ic.

compactifications on $M_p \times M_{Nq}$, where $M_{Nq}$ is itself a product of
$N$ $q$-dimensional Einstein manifolds. The higher-dimensional action has a
cosmological term $\Lambda$ and a $q$-form flux, which individually wraps each
element of the product; the extended dimensions $M_p$ can be anti-de Sitter,
Minkowski, or de Sitter. We find the masses of every excitation around this
background, as well as the conditions under which these solutions are stable.
This generalizes previous work on Freund-Rubin vacua, which focused on the
$N=1$ case, in which a $q$-form flux wraps a single $q$-dimensional Einstein
manifold. The $N=1$ case can have a classical instability when the
$q$-dimensional internal manifold is a product---one of the members of the
product wants to shrink while the rest of the manifold expands. Here, we will
see that individually wrapping each element of the product with a lower-form
flux cures this cycle-collapse instability. The $N=1$ case can also have an
instability when $\Lambda>0$ and $q\ge4$ to shape-mode perturbations; we find
the same instability in compactifications with general $N$, and show that it
even extends to cases where $\Lambda\le0$. On the other hand, when $q=2$ or 3,
the shape modes are always stable and there is a broad class of AdS and de
Sitter vacua that are perturbatively stable to all fluctuations.

wealth of emission with prominent features from CO$_2$ and H$_2$O and possible
contributions from HCN and OH. We model the molecular emission and find that it
originates from a massive ($M \gtrsim 8 \times 10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$), warm
($T_{\rm ex} \approx 500$ K) and radially extended gas disk that is optically
thick at infrared wavelengths. We also report less enrichment in $^{17}$O and
$^{18}$O than previously found and a comparison of the Spitzer observations to
earlier data obtained by ISO-SWS reveals that the CO$_2$ flux has more than
doubled in 10 years time, indicating active and ongoing chemical evolution in
the circumbinary disk. If the gas originates from interaction between the
stellar wind and the dust, this suggests that the dust could be oxygen-rich in
nature. The molecular gas plays a crucial role in the thermal properties of the
circumbinary disk by allowing visible light to heat the dust and then trapping
the infrared photons emitted by the dust. This results in higher temperatures
and a more homogeneous temperature structure in the disk.

ALMA positions of 99 SMGs, together with 24um and radio imaging of this field,
we deblend the Herschel/SPIRE imaging of this region to extract their
far-infrared fluxes and colours. The median photometric redshifts for ALMA LESS
(ALESS) SMGs which are detected in at least two SPIRE bands increases with
wavelength of the peak in their SEDs, with z=2.3+/-0.2, 2.5+/-0.3 and 3.5+/-0.5

not have a >3-sigma counterpart at 250, 350 or 500-um. These galaxies have a
median photometric redshift of z=3.3+/-0.5, which is higher than the full ALESS
SMG sample; z=2.5+/-0.2. Using the photometric redshifts together with the
250-870um photometry, we estimate the far-infrared luminosities and
characteristic dust temperature of each SMG. The median infrared luminosity of
the S_870um>2mJy SMGs is L_IR=(3.0+/-0.3)x10^{12}Lo(SFR=300+/-30Mo/yr). At a
fixed luminosity, the characteristic dust temperature of these high-redshift
SMGs is 2-3K lower than comparably luminous galaxies at z=0, reflecting the
more extended star formation occurring in these systems. By extrapolating the
870um number counts to S_ 870um=1mJy, we show that the contribution of
S_870um>1mJy SMGs to the cosmic star formation budget is 20% of the total over
the redshift range z~1-4. We derive a median dust mass for these SMGs of
M_d=(3.6+/-0.3)x10^8Mo and by adopting an appropriate gas-to-dust ratio, we
estimate an average molecular mass of M_H2=(4.2+/-0.4)x10^{10}Mo. Finally, we
use our estimates of the H2 masses to show that SMGs with S_870um>1mJy contain
~10% of the z~2 volume-averaged H2 mass density at this epoch.

sample of 870um selected submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) with robust
identifications based on observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array

South, 77 of which have 4-19 band, optical-near-infrared, photometry. We model
the Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) for these 77 SMGs, deriving a median
photometric redshift of z=2.3+/-0.1. The remaining 19 SMGs have insufficient
optical or near-infrared photometry to derive photometric redshifts, but a
stacking analysis of IRAC and Herschel observations confirms they are not
spurious. Assuming these sources have an absolute H-band magnitude distribution
comparable to that of a complete sample of z~1-2 SMGs, we demonstrate that the
undetected SMGs lie at higher redshifts, raising the median redshift for SMGs
to z=2.5+/-0.2. More critically we show that the proportion of galaxies
undergoing an SMG phase at z>3 is 35+/-5% of the total population. We derive a
median stellar mass for SMGs of Mstar=(8+/-1)x10^10Mo, but caution that there
are significant systematic uncertainties in our stellar mass estimate, up to x5
for individual sources. We compare our sample of SMGs to a volume-limited,
morphologically classified sample of ellipticals in the local Universe.
Assuming the star formation activity in SMGs has a timescale of ~100Myr we show
that their descendants at z~0 would have a space density and M_H distribution
which are in good agreement with those of local ellipticals. In addition the
inferred mass-weighted ages of the local ellipticals broadly agree with the
look-back times of the SMG events. Taken together, these results are consistent
with a simple model that identifies SMGs as events that form most of the stars
seen in the majority of luminous elliptical galaxies at the present day.

properties of the SMGs with ALMA and Chandra observations in the Extended

to have unambiguously identified the X-ray counterparts of SMGs; this is
accomplished using the fully submm-identified, statistically reliable SMG

such relic galaxies, useful windows to explore the early Universe, have been
inconclusive to date: galaxies with masses and sizes like those observed at
high redshift (M*>10^11 Msun; Re<1.5 kpc) have been found in the local

galaxy. This paper explores the first case of a nearby galaxy, NGC1277 (in the
Perseus cluster at a distance of 73 Mpc), which fulfills all the criteria to be
considered a relic galaxy. Using deep optical spectroscopy, we derive the star
formation history along the structure of the galaxy: the stellar populations
are uniformly old (>10 Gyr) with no evidence for more recent star formation
episodes. The metallicity of their stars is super-solar ([Fe/H]=0.20+-0.04) and
alpha enriched ([alpha/Fe]=0.4+-0.1). This suggests a very short formation time

somewhat deeper than the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in all bands, and, in
particular, the z band approaches the depth of the stacked Sloan Stripe 82

present deals with fermionic sigma-models constructed by means of purely
fermionic coset spaces, namely we consider models with anticommuting
target-space fields only. We notice that the Grassmanian behaviour of the
fields implies several simplifications when we derive the action and the
radiative corrections, however it provides obstructions to some
supercoordinates transformations. In the second part of the work we extend the
fluid/gravity correspondence by considering supergravity theories in the bulk
and computing the black hole superpartner. The resulting metric is a black hole
solution of the supergravity equations of motion and its associated charges and
entropy depend upon Grassmann numbers. Moreover by fluid/gravity techniques we
find that also the fluid dynamics parameters, such as the temperature and the
velocity, are in general affected by Grassmann numbers.

the surface photometry with the Chandra X-ray observatory in only three (rest

constrain the temperature, density and abundance of the hot interstellar medium

entropy profile and assuming spherical symmetry, we show that the constraints
on the mass and thermodynamic properties of the ISM that are obtained by
fitting data from all three bands simultaneously are comparable to those
obtained by fitting similar models to the temperature and density profiles
derived from spatially resolved spectroscopy, as is typically done. We
demonstrate that the constraints can be significantly tightened when exploiting
a recently derived, empirical relationship between the gas fraction and the
entropy profile at large scales, eliminating arbitrary extrapolations at large
radii. This ""Scaled Adiabatic Model"" (ScAM) is well suited to modest
signal-to-noise data, and we show that accurate, precise measurements of the
global system properties are inferred when employing it to fit data from even
very shallow, snapshot X-ray observations. The well-defined asymptotic

standard determinantal point process in the complex plane. The weight however
is non-standard and can be expressed in terms of the Meijer G-function. The
explicit knowledge of all eigenvalue correlation functions and the
corresponding kernel allows us to take various large $N$ (and $L$) limits at
fixed $M$. At strong non-unitarity, with $L/N$ finite, the eigenvalues condense
on a domain inside the unit circle. At the edge and in the bulk we find the
same universal microscopic kernel as for a single complex non-Hermitian matrix
from the Ginibre ensemble. At the origin we find the same new universality
classes labelled by $M$ as for the product of $M$ matrices from the Ginibre
ensemble. Keeping a fixed size of truncation, $L$, when $N$ goes to infinity
leads to weak non-unitarity, with most eigenvalues on the unit circle as for

the spatial volume. Using this we show how the Liouville measure formulated on
a surface of constant Hubble rate induces a probability distribution function
on surfaces of other Hubble rates, and the attractor behaviour is seen through
the focussing of this function on a narrow range of physical observables. One
can conclude then that standard techniques from Hamiltonian dynamics suffice to

the study of microbiota. However, deep sequencing and assembly of all of
millions of cells in a sample is prohibitively costly. A property that can come
to rescue is that deep sequencing of every cell should not be necessary to
capture all distinct genomes, as the majority of cells are biological
replicates. Biologically important samples are often sparse in that sense. In
this paper, we propose an adaptive compressed method, also known as distilled
sensing, to capture all distinct genomes in a sparse microbial community with
reduced sequencing effort. As opposed to group testing in which the number of
distinct events is often constant and sparsity is equivalent to rarity of an
event, sparsity in our case means scarcity of distinct events in comparison to
the data size. Previously, we introduced the problem and proposed a distilled
sensing solution based on the breadth first search strategy. We simulated the
whole process which constrained our ability to study the behavior of the
algorithm for the entire ensemble due to its computational intensity. In this
paper, we modify our previous breadth first search strategy and introduce the
depth first search strategy. Instead of simulating the entire process, which is
intractable for a large number of experiments, we provide a dynamic programming
algorithm to analyze the behavior of the method for the entire ensemble. The
ensemble analysis algorithm recursively calculates the probability of capturing
every distinct genome and also the expected total sequenced nucleotides for a
given population profile. Our results suggest that the expected total sequenced
nucleotides grows proportional to $\log$ of the number of cells and
proportional linearly with the number of distinct genomes.

seen in the spectra of narrow lined active galactic nuclei (AGN). Mean field
independent component analysis identifies examples of individual SDSS galaxies
whose spectra are not dominated by emission due to star formation (SF), which
we designate as AGN. We assembled high S/N ratio composite spectra of a
sequence of these AGN defined by the ionization level of their narrow-line
regions (NLR), extending down to very low-ionization cases. We used a local
optimally emitting cloud (LOC) model to fit emission-line ratios in this AGN
sequence. These included the weak lines that can be measured only in the
co-added spectra, providing consistency checks on strong line diagnostics.
After integrating over a wide range of radii and densities our models indicate
that the radial extent of the NLR is the major parameter in determining the
position of high to moderate ionization AGN along our sequence, providing a
physical interpretation for their systematic variation. Higher ionization AGN
contain optimally emitting clouds that are more concentrated towards the
central continuum source than in lower ionization AGN. Our LOC models indicate
that for the objects that lie on our AGN sequence, the ionizing luminosity is
anticorrelated with the NLR ionization level, and hence anticorrelated with the
radial concentration and physical extent of the NLR. A possible interpretation
that deserves further exploration is that the ionization sequence might be an
age sequence where low ionization objects are older and have systematically
cleared out their central regions by radiation pressure. We consider that our
AGN sequence instead represents a mixing curve of SF and AGN spectra, but argue
that while many galaxies do have this type of composite spectra, our AGN
sequence appears to be a special set of objects with negligible SF excitation.

of coordination is shown to require epistemic properties, and the causal
structure required to obtain these properties is characterised via ""knowledge

presented, generalising previous causal structures for this model. It is shown
to capture coordination tasks in which a sequence of clusters of events is
performed in linear order, while within each cluster all actions must take
place simultaneously. This form of coordination is shown to require the agents
to gain a nested common knowledge of particular facts, which in turn requires a
centibroom. Altogether, the results presented provide a broad view of the
causal shape underlying partially ordered coordinated actions. This, in turn,
provides insight into and can enable the design of efficient solutions to the

characterises the interactive epistemic state that arises when actions must

turbulence, designed to test various hypotheses frequently assumed in star
formation(SF) theories. We consider three simulations, each with a different
combination of physical size, rms sonic Mach number, and Jeans parameter, but
chosen as to give the same value of the virial parameter and to conform with
Larson's scaling relations. As in the non-magnetic case: we find no
simultaneously subsonic and super-Jeans structures in our MHD simulations. We
find that the fraction of small-scale super-Jeans structures increases when
self gravity is turned on, and that the production of gravitationally unstable
dense cores by turbulence alone is very low. This implies that self-gravity is
in general necessary not only to induce the collapse of Jeans-unstable cores,
but also to form them. We find that denser regions tend to have more negative
values of the velocity divergence, implying a net inwards flow towards the
regions' centers. We compare the results from our simulations with the
predictions from the recent SF theories by Krumholz & McKee, Padoan & Nordlund,
and Hennebelle & Chabrier, using the expressions recently provided by Federrath
& Klessen. We find that none of these theories reproduces the dependence of the
SFEff with Ms observed in our simulations in the MHD case. The SFEff predicted
by the theories ranges between half and one order of magnitude larger than what
we observe in the simulations in both the HD and the MHD cases. We conclude
that the type of flow used in simulations like the ones presented here and
assumed in recent SF theories, may not correctly represent the flow within
actual clouds, and that theories that assume it does may be missing a
fundamental aspect of the flow. We suggest that a more realistic regime may be
that of hierarchical gravitational collapse.

another -- if a player changes strategies, then this change in strategies does
not affect the choice of other players' strategies. In many situations this is
an unrealistic assumption. We develop a framework for reasoning about games
where the players may be translucent to one another; in particular, a player
may believe that if she were to change strategies, then the other player would
also change strategies. Translucent players may achieve significantly more
efficient outcomes than opaque ones.
  Our main result is a characterization of strategies consistent with
appropriate analogues of common belief of rationality. Common Counterfactual
Belief of Rationality (CCBR) holds if (1) everyone is rational, (2) everyone
counterfactually believes that everyone else is rational (i.e., all players i
believe that everyone else would still be rational even if i were to switch
strategies), (3) everyone counterfactually believes that everyone else is
rational, and counterfactually believes that everyone else is rational, and so

if there exists a strategy $\sigma'_i$ for i such that $\min_{\mu'_{-i}}

weighted formulas, whose weights are learned from data. However, in contrast to
Markov logic, in our framework we use the knowledge base to define a
probability distribution over non-equivalent epistemic situations (pointed
Kripke structures) rather than over atoms, and use this distribution to assign
probabilities to modal formulas. As in all probabilistic representations, the
central task in our framework is inference. Although the size of the state
space grows doubly exponentially in the number of propositions in the domain,
we provide an algorithm that scales only exponentially in the size of the
knowledge base. Finally, we briefly discuss the case of languages with an
infinite number of propositions.

changing patterns of knowledge and social relationships in networks organised
on the basis of a symmetric 'friendship' relation, providing a precise language
for exploring 'logic in the community' [11]. Agents are placed in the model,
allowing us to express such indexical facts as 'I am your friend' and 'You, my
friends, are in danger'.
  The technical framework for this work is general dynamic dynamic logic (GDDL)
[4], which provides a general method for extending modal logics with dynamic
operators for reasoning about a wide range of model-transformations, starting
with those definable in propositional dynamic logic (PDL) and extended to allow
for the more subtle operators involved in, for example, private communication,
as represented in dynamic epistemic logic (DEL) and related systems. We provide
a hands-on introduction to GDDL, introducing elements of the formalism as we
go, but leave the reader to consult [4] for technical details.
  Instead, the purpose of this paper is to investigate a number of conceptual
issues that arise when considering communication between agents in such
networks, both from one agent to another, and broadcasts to socially-defined
groups of agents, such as the group of my friends.

properties considered here are anonymity, privacy, onymity, and identity. Our
initial observation reveals that anonymity and privacy are not necessarily
sequentially compositional; this means that even though a system comprising
several sequential phases satisfies a certain unlinkability property in each
phase, the entire system does not always enjoy a desired unlinkability
property. We show that the compositionality can be guaranteed provided that the
phases of the system satisfy what we call the independence assumptions. More
specifically, we develop a series of theoretical case studies of what
assumptions are sufficient to guarantee the sequential compositionality of
various degrees of anonymity, privacy, onymity, and/or identity properties.
Similar results for parallel composition are also discussed.

the state of the network, which includes connectivity and channel state
information. With limited local information about the network, each node's
knowledge is mismatched; therefore, they must make distributed decisions. In
this paper, we pose the following question - if every node has network state
information only about a small neighborhood, how and when should nodes choose
to transmit? While link scheduling answers the above question for
point-to-point physical layers which are designed for an interference-avoidance
paradigm, we look for answers in cases when interference can be embraced by
advanced PHY layer design, as suggested by results in network information
theory.
  To make progress on this challenging problem, we propose a constructive
distributed algorithm that achieves rates higher than link scheduling based on
interference avoidance, especially if each node knows more than one hop of
network state information. We compare our new aggressive algorithm to a
conservative algorithm we have presented in [1]. Both algorithms schedule
sub-networks such that each sub-network can employ advanced
interference-embracing coding schemes to achieve higher rates. Our innovation
is in the identification, selection and scheduling of sub-networks, especially
when sub-networks are larger than a single link.

electrons. Since most of the conjugated carbon based structures possess ligands
with intermediate strength, the ordering of the d-orbital splitting is similar
in all structures, and the HM properties evolve according to the number of

control the energy gaps evolving in majority or minority spin channels.

$\dot{x}=Ax+\epsilon P(t)x+f(t)$, where $P(t)$ is periodic and $\epsilon$ is
small. Using a 2-scale expansion approach, we obtain the long-time
approximation $x(t)\approx \exp(At) \left( \Omega(t)+\int_0^t \exp(-A \tau)
f(\tau) \, d\tau \right)$, where $\Omega$ solves the cell problem
$\dot{\Omega}=\epsilon B \Omega + \epsilon F(t)$ with an effective matrix $B$
and an explicitly-known $F(t)$. We provide necessary and sufficient condition
for the accuracy of the approximation (over a $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$
time-scale), and show how $B$ can be computed (at a cost independent of
$\epsilon$). As a direct application, we investigate the possibility of using
RLC circuits to harvest the energy contained in small scale oscillations of
ambient electromagnetic fields (such as Schumann resonances). Although a RLC
circuit parametrically coupled to the field may achieve such energy extraction
via parametric resonance, its resistance $R$ needs to be smaller than a
threshold $\kappa$ proportional to the fluctuations of the field, thereby
limiting practical applications. We show that if $n$ RLC circuits are
appropriately coupled via mutual capacitances or inductances, then energy
extraction can be achieved when the resistance of each circuit is smaller than
$n\kappa$. Hence, if the resistance of each circuit has a non-zero fixed value,
energy extraction can be made possible through the coupling of a sufficiently
large number $n$ of circuits ($n\approx 1000$ for the first mode of Schumann
resonances and contemporary values of capacitances, inductances and
resistances). The theory is also applied to the control of the oscillation
amplitude of a (damped) oscillator.

at the quartic order and compute some superluminal propagating solutions. We

consid- ered how to relax the condition of barrier certificates while still
keeping their convexity so that one can synthesize more expressive barrier
certificates efficiently using semi-definite programming (SDP). In this paper,
we first discuss how to relax the condition of barrier certificates in a
general way, while still keeping their convexity. Particularly, one can then
utilize different weaker conditions flexibly to synthesize dif- ferent kinds of
barrier certificates with more expressiveness efficiently using SDP. These
barriers give more opportuni- ties to verify the considered system. We also
show how to combine two functions together to form a combined barrier
certificate in order to prove a safety property under consid- eration, whereas
neither of them can be used as a barrier certificate separately, even according
to any relaxed condi- tion. Another contribution of this paper is that we
discuss how to discover certificates from the general relaxed condi- tion by
SDP. In particular, we focus on how to avoid the unsoundness because of numeric
error caused by SDP with symbolic checking

  combinatorics, incidence combinatorics, and number theory","44 pages, no figures. Final revision, incorporating several minor
  corrections",,,,"math.CO math.AG math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Arithmetic combinatorics is often concerned with the problem of bounding the
behaviour of arbitrary finite sets in a group or ring with respect to
arithmetic operations such as addition or multiplication. Similarly,
combinatorial geometry is often concerned with the problem of bounding the
behaviour of arbitrary finite collections of geometric objects such as points,
lines, or circles with respect to geometric operations such as incidence or
distance. Given the presence of arbitrary finite sets in these problems, the
methods used to attack these problems have primarily been combinatorial in
nature. In recent years, however, many outstanding problems in these questions
have been solved by algebraic means (and more specifically, using tools from
algebraic geometry and/or algebraic topology), giving rise to an emerging set
of techniques which is now known as the polynomial method.
  While various instances of the polynomial method have been known for decades
(e.g. Stepanov's method, the combinatorial nullstellensatz, or Baker's
theorem), the general theory of this method is still in the process of
maturing; in particular, the limitations of the polynomial method are not well
understood, and there is still considerable scope to apply deeper results from
algebraic geometry or algebraic topology to strengthen the method further. In
this survey we present several of the known applications of these methods,
focusing on the simplest cases to illustrate the techniques. We will assume as
little prior knowledge of algebraic geometry as possible.

{\beta}-pyrochlores, AOs2O6 (A = K, Rb, Cs), from the results of ab initio
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations performed at 20 K, 100 K, and 300 K. Our
results show that the temperature response of the T1u mode is clearly different
from that of the T2g mode for all three pyrochlores. In this regard, two
features are of particular note for both K and Rb; (1) the T1u mode exhibits a
distinctly stronger softening response with decreasing temperature compared to
the T2g mode, and (2) the T1u mode becomes stronger and sharper with decreasing
temperature. These two findings suggest that the T1u mode is significantly more
anharmonic and sensitive to the cage dynamics than the T2g mode. Examination of
the local potentials around the alkali-metal atoms reveals that K has the
flattest and most anharmonic potential at all temperatures while Cs exhibits
the narrowest potential. The temperature dependence of the local potentials
reveals that, for K, the potential at a higher temperature is not a simple
extrapolation to higher energy of that at a lower temperature. Instead, we find
significant reconstruction of the potential at different temperatures. Finally,
we explore the temperature response of the coupling between the alkali metals
and find a complex temperature dependence which suggests that the origin of the
coupling may be more complex than a pure Coulomb interaction. We also find an
unexpected increase in the static disorder of the system at low temperatures
for the K and Rb pyrochlores.

generator matrix is specified by the knowledge of transmission channel
parameters, code length and code dimension. Moreover, regarding computational
security, it is assumed that an attacker with a restricted processing power has
unlimited access to the transmission media. Therefore, the attacker can
construct the generator matrix of polar codes, especially in the case of Binary
Erasure Channels, on which this matrix can be easily constructed. In this
paper, we introduce a novel method to keep the generator matrix of polar codes
in secret in a way that the attacker cannot access the required information to
decode the intended polar code. With the help of this method, a secret key
cryptosystem is proposed based on non-systematic polar codes. In fact, the main
objective of this study is to achieve an acceptable level of security and
reliability through taking advantage of the special properties of polar codes.
The analyses revealed that our scheme resists the typical attacks on the secret
key cryptosystems based on linear block codes. In addition, by employing some
efficient methods, the key length of the proposed scheme is decreased compared
to that of the previous cryptosystems. Moreover, this scheme enjoys other
advantages including high code rate, and proper error performance as well.

systemic risk evaluation and regulation still persist, as the definition of
systemic risk is somewhat unsettled and that affects attempts to provide
solutions. Our understanding of systemic risk is evolving and the awareness of

method to use pressure to investigate the laser-induced femtosecond magnetism.
Since the pressure effect on the electronic and magnetic properties can be well
controlled experimentally, this leaves little room for ambiguity when compared
with theory. Here we report our theoretical pressure results in fcc Ni:
Pressure first suppresses the spin moment reduction, and then completely
diminishes it; further increase in pressure to 40 GPa induces a
demagnetization-to-magnetization transition. To reveal its microscopic origin,
we slide through the L-U line in the Brillouin zone and find two essential
transitions are responsible for this change, where the pressure lowers two
valence bands, resulting in an off-resonant excitation and thus a smaller spin
moment reduction. In the spin-richest L-W-W' plane, two spin contours are
formed; as pressure increases, the contour size retrieves and its intensity is
reduced to zero eventually, fully consistent with the spin-dipole factor
prediction. These striking features are detectable in time- and spin-resolved
photoemission experiments.

accretion disk is a Two Component Advective Flow (TCAF), we numerically
simulate the light curves emitted from an accretion disk for different
accretion rates and find how the QPO frequencies vary. We use a standard
Keplerian disk residing at the equatorial plane as a source of soft photons.
These soft photons, after suffering multiple scattering with the hot electrons
of the low angular momentum, sub-Keplerian, flow emerge out as hard radiation.
The hydrodynamic and thermal properties of the electron cloud is simulated
using a Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) code. The TVD code is then coupled
with a radiative transfer code which simulates the energy exchange between the
electron and radiation using Monte Carlo technique. The resulting localized
heating and cooling are included also. We find that the QPO frequency increases
and the spectrum becomes softer as we increase the Keplerian disk rate.
However, the spectrum becomes harder if we increase the sub-Keplerian accretion
rate. We find that an earlier prediction that QPOs occur when the infall time
scale roughly matches with the cooling time scale, originally obtained using a
power-law cooling, remains valid even for Compton cooling. Our findings agree
with the general observations of low frequency QPOs in black hole candidates.

bright bulges that are similar to those found in early type galaxies. The
bulges can host low luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) that have
relatively low mass black holes. GLSB galaxies are usually isolated systems and

2008 and 2012. During this period, the source was detected at very high
energies (VHE; E > 100 GeV) by VERITAS with a significance of $8.9\sigma$ and
showed clear variability on time scales larger than months. In 2011, the source
was found to be in a relatively bright state and a power-law fit to the
differential photon spectrum yields a spectral index of $3.6 \pm
0.4_{\mathrm{stat}} \pm 0.3_{\mathrm{syst}}$ with an integral flux above 200
GeV of $(8.0 \pm 0.9_{\mathrm{stat}} \pm 3.2_{\mathrm{syst}}) \times 10^{-12}\,
\mathrm{cm}^{-2} \mathrm{s}^{-1}$. No short term variability could be detected
during the bright state in 2011. Multi-wavelength data were obtained
contemporaneous with the VERITAS observations in 2011 and cover optical
(Super-LOTIS, MDM, Swift-UVOT), X-ray (Swift-XRT), and gamma-ray (Fermi-LAT)
frequencies. These were used to construct the spectral energy distribution
(SED) of B2 1215+30. A one-zone leptonic model is used to model the blazar
emission and the results are compared to those of MAGIC from early 2011 and
other VERITAS-detected blazars. The SED can be well reproduced with model
parameters typical for VHE-detected BL Lacs.

between relative motion and internal degrees of freedom of the collision
partners. The time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory and the
coupled-channels (CC) method are standard approaches to investigate this aspect
of fusion dynamics. However, both approaches present limitations, such as a
lack of tunnelling of the many-body wave function in the former and a need for
external parameters to describe the nucleus-nucleus potential and the couplings
in the latter. Method: A method combining both approaches is proposed to
overcome these limitations. CC calculations are performed using two types of
inputs from Hartree-Fock (HF) theory: the nucleus-nucleus potential calculated
with the frozen HF method, and the properties of low-lying vibrational states
and giant resonances computed from the TDHF linear response. Results: The
effect of the couplings to vibrational modes is studied in the
$^{40}$Ca$+^{40}$Ca and $^{56}$Ni$+^{56}$Ni systems. This work demonstrates
that the main effect of these couplings is a lowering of the barrier, in good
agreement with the fusion thresholds predicted by TDHF calculations.
Conclusions: As the only phenomenological inputs are the choice of the internal
states of the nuclei and the parameters of the energy density functional used
in the HF and TDHF calculations, the method presented in this work has a broad
range of possible applications, including studies of alternative couplings or
reactions involving exotic nuclei.

study of the region. The present study focuses on the X-ray properties of
T-Tauri Stars (TTSs) in the NGC 1893 region. We found a correlation between the
X-ray luminosity, $L_X$, and the stellar mass (in the range 0.2$-$2.0 \msun) of
TTSs in the NGC 1893 region, similar to those reported in some other young
clusters, however the value of the power-law slope obtained in the present
study ($\sim$ 0.9) for NGC 1893 is smaller than those ($\sim$1.4 - 3.6)
reported in the case of TMC, ONC, IC 348 and Chameleon star forming regions.
However, the slope in the case of Class III sources (Weak line TTSs) is found
to be comparable to that reported in the case of NGC 6611 ($\sim$ 1.1). It is
found that the presence of circumstellar disks has no influence on the X-ray
emission. The X-ray luminosity for both CTTSs and WTTSs is found to decrease
systematically with age (in the range $\sim $ 0.4 Myr - 5 Myr). The decrease of
the X-ray luminosity of TTSs (slope $\sim$ -0.6) in the case of NGC 1893 seems
to be faster than observed in the case of other star-forming regions (slope
-0.2 to -0.5). There is indication that the sources having relatively large NIR
excess have relatively lower $L_X$ values. TTSs in NGC 1893 do not follow the
well established X-ray activity - rotation relation as in the case of

of semilinear parabolic problems are sensitive to arbitrarily small but smooth
perturbations of the nonlinear term, when the spatial dimension is either equal
to one or two. This topological instability is shown to result from a local
deformation of the global bifurcation diagram associated with the corresponding
elliptic problems. Such a deformation is shown to systematically occur via the
creation of either a multiple-point or a new fold-point on this diagram when an
appropriate small perturbation is applied to the nonlinear term. More
precisely, it is shown that for a broad class of nonlinear elliptic problems,
one can always find an arbitrary small perturbation of the nonlinear term, that
generates a local S on the bifurcation diagram whereas the latter is e.g.
monotone when no perturbation is applied; substituting thus a single solution
by several ones. Such an increase in the local multiplicity of the solutions to
the elliptic problem results then into a topological instability for the
corresponding parabolic problem.
  The rigorous proof of the latter instability result requires though to
revisit the classical concept of topological equivalence to encompass important
cases for the applications such as semi-linear parabolic problems for which the
semigroup may exhibit non-global dissipative properties, allowing for the
coexistence of blow-up regions and local attractors in the phase space; cases
that arise e.g. in combustion theory. A revised framework of topological
robustness is thus introduced in that respect within which the main topological
instability result is then proved for continuous, locally Lipschitz but not
necessarily $C^1$ nonlinear terms, that prevent in particular the use of
linearization techniques, and for which the family of semigroups may exhibit
non-dissipative properties.

problem which minimizes the transmitted power under outage probability and

we study a cooperative protocol where sources' transmissions are supported by a
random number of potential relays that are randomly distributed into the

of the inter-electron-electron pair coupling [J Phys Chem Lett 4, 2565 (2013);
ibid 4, 3238 (2013)]. Heating stores energy into the H-O bond by shortening and
stiffening it. Cooling the water as the source in a refrigerator as a drain,
the H-O bond releases its energy at a rate that depends exponentially on the
initially storage of energy, and therefore, Mpemba effect happens. This effect
is formulated in terms of the relaxation time tau to represent all possible
processes of energy loss. Consistency between predictions and measurements
revealed that the tau drops exponentially intrinsically with the initial
temperature of the water being cooled.

the network of organizations employment structure, and organization value. The
main findings are that 1) the higher the number of members of CNs, the better
the clustering and the shorter the average path length among organizations; 2)
the constitution of CNs does not affect neither the structure of the network of

line with mean density $\rho$ and mean strength $v$. Our study is motivated by
the close connection between this problem and classical diffusion in a random
environment (the Sinai problem) in the presence of random absorbers~: $\phi(x)$
models the force field acting on the diffusing particle and $\kappa(x)$ models
the absorption properties of the medium in which the diffusion takes place. The
focus is on the calculation of the complex Lyapunov exponent $ \Omega(E) =
\gamma(E) - \mathrm{i} \pi N(E) $, where $N$ is the integrated density of
states per unit length and $\gamma$ the reciprocal of the localisation length.
By using the continuous version of the Dyson-Schmidt method, we find an exact
formula, in terms of a Hankel function, in the particular case where the
strength of the delta functions is exponentially-distributed with mean $v=2g$.
Building on this result, we then solve the general case -- in the low-energy
limit -- in terms of an infinite sum of Hankel functions. Our main result,
valid without restrictions on the parameters of the model, is that the
integrated density of states exhibits the power law behaviour

importance in simulating prices of financial derivatives or their sensitivities

stochastic volatility (SV) models makes exact simulation difficult. In this
paper, we present a nontrivial SV model that parallels the notable Heston SV
model in the sense of admitting exact path simulation as studied by Broadie and
Kaya. The instantaneous volatility process of the proposed model is driven by a
Gamma process. Extensions to the model including superposition of independent
instantaneous volatility processes are studied. Numerical results show that the
proposed model outperforms the Heston model and two other L\'evy driven SV
models in terms of model fit to the real option data. The ability to exactly
simulate some of the path-dependent derivative prices is emphasized. Moreover,
this is the first instance where an infinite-activity volatility process can be
applied exactly in such pricing contexts.

evolution. We find that the XLF can be reproduced quite closely under both CE
mechanisms usually adopted, i.e., the $\alpha_{\rm CE}$ formalism and the
$\gamma$ algorithm, with a reasonable range of parameters considered. Provided
that the parameter combination is the same, the $\gamma$ algorithm is likely to
produce more HMXBs than the $\alpha_{\rm CE}$ formalism, by a factor of up to
$\sim$ 10. In the framework of the $\alpha_{\rm CE}$ formalism, a high value of
$\alpha_{\rm CE}$ is required to fit the observed XLF, though it does not
significantly affect the global number of the HMXB populations. We present the
detailed components of the HMXB populations under the $\gamma$ algorithm and
compare them with those in Zuo et al. and observations. We suggest the distinct

counteract local dissipative processes and preserve entanglement in the
stationary state. The results determine prospects and limitations of
dissipative state preparation schemes based on natural dissipative processes --
in contrast to engineered, typically non-local dissipative schemes. As an
exemplary case, we determine the stationary state of two spontaneously decaying
two-level systems with optimal entanglement properties. The corresponding
system Hamiltonian is derived, and its possible experimental implementation is
discussed in detail. Finally, we discuss generalizations for many qubits.

field equations. In the fourth November 25, 1915 paper, Einstein added a trace
term of the energy-momentum tensor on the right-hand side of the generally
covariant field equations. The main purpose of the present work is to show that
in November 4, 1915, Einstein had already explored much of the main ingredients
that were required for the formulation of the final form of the field equations
of November 25, 1915. The present work suggests that the idea of adding the
second-term on the right-hand side of the field equation might have originated
in reconsideration of the November 4, 1915 field equations. In this regard, the
final form of Einstein's field equations with the trace term may be linked with
his work of November 4, 1915. The interesting history of the derivation of the
final form of the field equations is inspired by the exchange of letters
between Einstein and Paul Ehrenfest in winter 1916 and by Einstein's 1916

multi-soliton solutions onto systems of vertices - structures that are
localized around soliton junctions. A solution with one junction is mapped onto
a single vertex, which emulates a free, spatially extended, particle. In
solutions with several junctions, each junction is mapped onto a vertex. Moving
in the x-y plane, the vertices collide, coalesce upon collision, and then split
up. When well separated, they emulate free particles. Multi-soliton solutions,
whose structure does not change under space-time inversion as for infinite
times, are mapped onto vertex systems that undergo elastic collisions.
Solutions, whose structure does change, are mapped onto systems that undergo
inelastic collisions. The inelastic vertex collisions generated from the
infinite family of (M,1) solutions (M external solitons, (M-2) Y-shaped soliton
junctions, M greater than 3) play a unique role: The only definition of vertex
mass consistent with momentum conservation in these collisions is the spatial
integral of the vertex profile. This definition ensures, in addition, that, in
these collisions, the total mass and kinetic energy due to the motion in the
y-direction are conserved. In general, the kinetic energy due to the motion in
the x-direction is not conserved in these collisions.

additional noise in the data. We propose a machine learning pipeline aimed at
identifying multivariate differences between brain networks associated to
different experimental conditions. The pipeline (1) leverages the deconvolved

whose edge weights are defined by their relevance for out of sample predictions
in classification. We present an application of the proposed method by decoding
the covert attention direction (left or right) based on the single-trial

metabolic interactions between neurons and astrocytes. Important open questions
include the relation between neuronal versus astrocytic energy demand, glucose
uptake and intercellular lactate transfer, as well as their dependence on the
level of activity. We have developed a large-scale, constraint-based network
model of the metabolic partnership between astrocytes and glutamatergic neurons
that allows for a quantitative appraisal of the extent to which stoichiometry
alone drives the energetics of the system. We find that the velocity of the
glutamate-glutamine cycle ($V_{cyc}$) explains part of the uncoupling between
glucose and oxygen utilization at increasing $V_{cyc}$ levels. Thus, we are
able to characterize different activation states in terms of the tissue
oxygen-glucose index (OGI). Calculations show that glucose is taken up and
metabolized according to cellular energy requirements, and that partitioning of
the sugar between different cell types is not significantly affected by
$V_{cyc}$. Furthermore, both the direction and magnitude of the lactate shuttle
between neurons and astrocytes turn out to depend on the relative cell glucose
uptake while being roughly independent of $V_{cyc}$. These findings suggest
that, in absence of ad hoc activity-related constraints on neuronal and
astrocytic metabolism, the glutamate-glutamine cycle does not control the
relative energy demand of neurons and astrocytes, and hence their glucose
uptake and lactate exchange.

careful account of the requirements of causality and passivity. Then, the
generation of such a wave by transmission, from ordinary homogeneous material,
into a half-space composed of the laminate is considered. As is well-known for
any dispersive material, phase velocity is distinct from group velocity, and
information is carried by the latter. Thus, in line with the discussion of
photonic crystals by Notomi [1], refraction is considered in terms of the group
velocity. Negative refraction appears never to occur, if the interface between
ordinary material and composite is parallel to the interfaces in the composite
but negative refraction is possible, over an appreciable frequency range, if
the interface between ordinary material and composite is orthogonal to the
interface in the composite.

the main benefits of using cloud are rapid development, continuous integration,
cost savings, code sharing, and faster ramp-up. The key risks determined by the
project are dependencies, unavailability of access to the cloud, code
commitment and integration, technical debt, and additional support costs. The
results revealed that if such environments are not planned and set up
carefully, the benefits of using cloud in DSD projects might be overshadowed by
the risks associated with it.

inside giant molecular clouds. However, the conditions that initiate cloud
collapse and regulate the star formation process remain poorly understood.
Local processes such as turbulence and magnetic fields can act to promote or
prevent collapse. On larger scales, the galactic potential can also influence
cloud stability and is traditionally assessed by the tidal and shear effects.
In this paper, we examine the stability of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) against shear and the galactic tide using CO data
from the Magellanic Mopra Assessment (MAGMA) and rotation curve data from the
literature. We calculate the tidal acceleration experienced by individual GMCs
and determine the minimum cloud mass required for tidal stability. We also
calculate the shear parameter, which is a measure of a clouds susceptibility to
disruption via shearing forces in the galactic disk. We examine whether there
are correlations between the properties and star forming activity of GMCs and
their stability against shear and tidal disruption. We find that the GMCs are
in approximate tidal balance in the LMC, and that shear is unlikely to affect
their further evolution. GMCs with masses close to the minimal stable mass
against tidal disruption are not unusual in terms of their mass, location, or
CO brightness, but we note that GMCs with large velocity dispersion tend to be
more sensitive to tidal instability. We also note that GMCs with smaller radii,
which represent the majority of our sample, tend to more strongly resist tidal
and shear disruption. Our results demonstrate that star formation in the LMC is
not inhibited by to tidal or shear instability.

including stable supercritical and subcritical Turing patterns with multiple

traveling patterning waves: when the domain size is large, the pattern forms
sequentially and traveling wavefronts are the precursors to patterning. We
derive the Ginzburg-Landau equation and describe the traveling front enveloping

The time interval of the two SDSS observations is 1186.4 d at the quasar rest

rate are stable for the two observations, together with the time interval of

twofold. First, we justify the enclosure method for the impenetrable obstacle
case avoiding any assumption on the directions of the phases of the CGO's (or
the curvature of obstacle's surface). In addition, we need only a Lipschitz
regularity of this surface. The analysis is based on some fine properties of
the corresponding layer potentials in appropriate Sobolev spaces. Second, we
justify this method also for the penetrable case, where the interface is
modeled by the jump (or the discontinuity) of the magnetic permeability $\mu$.
A key point of the analysis is the global $L^p$-estimates for the curl of the
solutions of the Maxwell system with discontinuous coefficients. These
estimates are justified here for $p$ near $2$ generalizing to the Maxwell's

characterization of the magnetostatic and dynamic parameters of magnetic thin
films and multilayers on the wafer scale. The probe is based on a planar
waveguide with rearward high frequency connectors that can be brought in close
contact to the wafer surface. Inductive characterization of the magnetic
material is carried out by vector network analyzer ferromagnetic resonance.
Analysis of the field dispersion of the resonance allows the determination of
key material parameters such as the saturation magnetization MS or the
effective damping parameter Meff. Three waveguide designs are tested. The
broadband frequency response is characterized and the suitability for inductive
determination of MS and Meff is compared. Integration of such probes in a wafer
prober could in the future allow wafer scale in-line testing of magnetostatic
and dynamic key material parameters of magnetic thin films and multilayers.

111 and about 1.37 Mo for M31N 2010-10f in Bol 126. The transient supersoft
X-ray source CXO J004345 in Bol 194 is highly likely a nova remnant of 1.2 --
1.3 Mo WD. These WD masses are quite consistent with the temperatures deduced
from X-ray spectra. We also present the dependence of nova light curves on the
metallicity in the range from [Fe/H]=0.4 to -2.7. Whereas strong optically
thick winds are accelerated in Galactic disk novae owing to a large Fe opacity
peak, only weak winds occur in Population II novae with low Fe abundance. Thus,
nova light curves are systematically slow in low Fe environment. For an
extremely low Fe abundance normal nova outbursts may not occur unless the WD is
very massive. We encourage V or y filter observation rather than R as well as
high cadence X-ray monitorings to open quantitative studies of extragalactic
novae.

longitudinally smooth groupoid which algebraic and differential structure is
explicitely described. This groupoid has a natural geometric meaning as a
holonomy groupoid of singular foliation, it is a singular leaf space in the

This result allows the interpretation of phi-calculus as the pseudodifferential

the common assumption that dust and gas kinetic temperatures are equivalent. As

resistance measurements up to three pairs of Pt voltage leads were deposited by
FIBID at different distances beside the inner inducer electrode, thus allowing
us to probe the proximity effect over a length of 2-12 $\mu$m. Relative $R(T)$
drops of the same order of magnitude have been observed for the Co and Cu

long-range proximity effect in the case of ferromagnetic Co. Moreover, this
long-range proximity effect has been revealed to be insusceptible to magnetic
fields up to 11 T, which is indicative of spin-triplet pairing. At the same
time, in the nanogranular Co structure proximity-induced superconductivity is
strongly suppressed due to the dominating Cooper pair scattering caused by the

that a scheme can be reconstructed from the abelian category of quasi-coherent
sheaves over it. The methods employed are elementary and allow us to extend the
theorem to (quasi-compact and separated) algebraic spaces. Using more advanced
technology (and assuming flatness) we also give a proof of the folklore result
that the group of autoequivalences of the category of quasi-coherent sheaves
consists of automorphisms of the underlying space and twists by line bundles.
We apply our strategy to prove analogous statements for categories of sheaves
twisted by a Gm-gerbe. Our methods allow us to treat even gerbes not coming

decomposition has been extensively used and studied. Recent studies suggested
that the signal can be better estimated by shrinking the singular values. We
pursue this line of research and propose a new estimator offering a continuum
of thresholding and shrinking functions. To avoid an unstable and costly
cross-validation search, we propose new rules to select two thresholding and
shrinking parameters from the data. In particular we propose a generalized
Stein unbiased risk estimation criterion that does not require knowledge of the
variance of the noise and that is computationally fast. A Monte Carlo
simulation reveals that our estimator outperforms the tested methods in terms
of mean squared error on both low-rank and general signal matrices across
different signal to noise ratio regimes. In addition, it accurately estimates
the rank of the signal when it is detectable.

number of periods. The nulling fraction was often used to characterize the
phenomenon. We propose a new method to analyse pulsar nulling phenomenon, by
involving two key parameters, the nulling degree, $\chi$, which is defined as
the angle in a rectangular coordinates for the numbers of nulling periods and
bursting periods, and the nulling scale, $ N $, which is defined as the
effective length of the consecutive nulling periods and bursting periods. The
nulling degree $\chi$ can be calculated by $\tan \chi = N_{\rm nulling} /
N_{\rm bursting} $ and the mean is related to the nulling fraction, while the
nulling scale, $ N $, is also a newly defined fundamental parameter which
indicates how often the nulling occurs. We determined the distributions of
$\chi$ and $ N $ for 10 pulsars by using the data in literature. We found that
the nulling degree $\chi$ indicates the relative length of nulling to that of
bursting, and the nulling scale $ N $ is found to be related to the derivative
of rotation frequency and hence the loss rate of rotational energy of pulsars.
Their deviations reflect the randomness of the nulling process.

Galactic binary systems. A periodicity of 24.27 d with a formal statistical
error of 0.03 d was observed in its power spectrum density obtained with RXTE
All Sky Monitor (ASM) data spanning 14 years. Starting from a recent study,
indicating GX 13+1 as a possible dipping source candidate, we systematically
searched for periodic dips in the X-ray light curves of GX 13+1 from 1996 up to
2013 using RXTE/ASM, and MAXI data to determine for the first time the X-ray
orbital ephemeris of GX 13+1. We searched for a periodic signal in the ASM and
MAXI light curves, finding a common periodicity of 24.53 d. We folded the 1.3-5
keV and 5-12.1 keV ASM light curves and the 2-4 and 4-10 keV MAXI light curves
at the period of 24.53 d finding a periodic dip. To refine the value of the
period we used the timing technique dividing the ASM light curve in eight
intervals and the MAXI light curve in two intervals, obtaining four and two dip
arrival times from the ASM and MAXI light curves, respectively. We improved the
X-ray position of GX 13+1 using a recent Chandra observation. The new X-ray
position is discrepant by $\sim 7\arcsec$ from the previous one, while it is
compatible with the infrared and radio counterpart positions. We detected an
X-ray dip, that is totally covered by the Chandra observation, in the light
curve of GX 13+1 and showed, a-posteriori, that it is a periodic dip. We
obtained seven dip arrival times from ASM, MAXI, and Chandra light curves. We
calculated the delays of the detected dip arrival times with respect to the
expected times for a 24.52 d periodicity. Fitting the delays with a linear
function we find that the orbital period and the epoch of reference of GX 13+1
are 24.5274(2) days and 50,086.79(3) MJD, respectively.(Abridged)

stage of crystallization, when nucleation is dominant. The remarkable result of
these major generalizations is that the non-equilibrium grain size distribution
is robust against anisotropic growth of grains and fluctuations of nuclei

maximizing modularity with hierarchical clustering. Our closeness functions are

our approach in detecting community structure in quantum systems, we provide
several examples, including a naturally occurring light-harvesting complex,

four-manifold with boundary into another. We compute the ECH capacities of a
large family of symplectic four-manifolds with boundary, called ""concave toric
domains"". Examples include the (nondisjoint) union of two ellipsoids in
$\mathbb{R}^4$. We use these calculations to find sharp obstructions to certain
symplectic embeddings involving concave toric domains. For example: (1) we
calculate the Gromov width of every concave toric domain; (2) we show that many
inclusions of an ellipsoid into the union of an ellipsoid and a cylinder are
""optimal""; and (3) we find a sharp obstruction to ball packings into certain
unions of an ellipsoid and a cylinder.

polar codes is proposed. The existing analysis tools of the underlying
rate-compatible punctured polar (RCPP) codes for additive white Gaussian noise
(AWGN) channels are extended to Rayleigh fading channels. Then, an
approximation bound of the throughput efficiency for the polar coded HARQ-CC
scheme is derived. Utilizing this bound, the parameter configurations of the
proposed scheme can be optimized. Simulation results show that, the proposed
HARQ-CC scheme under a low-complexity SC decoding is only about $1.0$dB away
from the existing schemes with incremental redundancy (\mbox{HARQ-IR}).
Compared with the polar coded \mbox{HARQ-IR} scheme, the proposed HARQ-CC
scheme requires less retransmissions and has the advantage of good
compatibility to other communication techniques.

gauge invariance that has to be taken into account. We then propose a specific
protocol where the dynamics is non-trivial. Employing techniques coming from
the Algebraic Bethe-Ansatz, we present an exact formula for the Loschmidt echo
valid at all times as a Fredholm determinant at the free fermionic point. From
the analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the Fredholm determinant, we show
that the distribution of work done at small energies present an edge
singularity whose exponent can be explicitly computed. Using the correspondence
between the edge singularity and the decay of the fidelity at finite-size we
propose a general formula for the exponent valid also in the interacting case.

in computer vision. Salient regions can serve as inputs for object detectors as
well as inputs for region based registration algorithms. In this paper we
consider the problem of speeding up computationally intensive bottom-up salient
region detection in 3D medical volumes.The method uses the Kadir Brady
formulation of saliency. We show that in the vicinity of a salient region,
entropy is a monotonically increasing function of the degree of overlap of a
candidate window with the salient region. This allows us to initialize a sparse
seed-point grid as the set of tentative salient region centers and iteratively
converge to the local entropy maxima, thereby reducing the computation
complexity compared to the Kadir Brady approach of performing this computation
at every point in the image. We propose two different approaches for achieving
this. The first approach involves evaluating entropy in the four quadrants
around the seed point and iteratively moving in the direction that increases
entropy. The second approach we propose makes use of mean shift tracking
framework to affect entropy maximizing moves. Specifically, we propose the use
of uniform pmf as the target distribution to seek high entropy regions. We
demonstrate the use of our algorithm on medical volumes for left ventricle
detection in PET images and tumor localization in brain MR sequences.

the metallic state of high-temperature superconductors in a multiband setting.
Various ways in which the bare magnetic response may become incommensurate are
measured against both phenomenological and theoretical requirements. In
particular, the pseudogap temperature is typically much higher than the
incommensurability temperature. When microscopic strong-coupling effects with
real-time dynamics between copper and oxygen sites are included, they tend to
restore commensurability. Quantum transport equations for low-dimensional
multiband electronic systems are used to explain the linear doping dependence
of the dc conductivity and the doping and temperature dependence of the Hall
number in the underdoped LSCO compounds. Coulomb effects of dopands are
inferred from the doping evolution of the Hartree-Fock model parameters.

  Turing patterns in ecological networks","18 pages, 9 figures",,,,"nlin.PS q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As proposed by Alan Turing in 1952 as a ubiquitous mechanism for
nonequilibrium pattern formation, diffusional effects may destabilize uniform
distributions of reacting chemical species and lead to both spatially and
temporally heterogeneous patterns. While stationary Turing patterns are broadly
known, the oscillatory instability, leading to traveling waves in continuous
media and also called the wave bifurcation, is rare for chemical systems. Here,
we extend the analysis by Turing to general networks and apply it to ecological
metapopulations of biological species with dispersal connections between
habitats. Remarkably, the oscillatory Turing instability does not lead to wave
patterns in networks, but to spontaneous development of heterogeneous
oscillations and possible extinction of some species, even though they are
absent for isolated populations. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis reveals
that this instability is more common in ecological metapopulations than in
chemical reactions. Indeed, we find the instabilities for all possible food
webs with three predator or prey species, under various assumptions about the
mobility of individual species and nonlinear interactions between them.
Therefore, we suggest that the oscillatory Turing instability is generic and
must play a fundamental role in metapopulation dynamics, providing a common
mechanism for dispersal-induced destabilization of ecosystems.

transportation systems in their future smart city plans. So the number of
electric vehicles (EVs) running in a city will grow significantly. There are
many ways to re-charge EVs' batteries and charging stations will be considered
as the main source of energy. The locations of charging stations are critical;
they should not only be pervasive enough such that an EV anywhere can easily
access a charging station within its driving range, but also widely spread so
that EVs can cruise around the whole city upon being re-charged. Based on these
new perspectives, we formulate the Electric Vehicle Charging Station Placement
Problem (EVCSPP) in this paper. We prove that the problem is non-deterministic
polynomial-time hard. We also propose four solution methods to tackle EVCSPP

  arXiv:1202.6655",,,"TARK/2013/p111","cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most work on manipulation assumes that all preferences are known to the
manipulators. However, in many settings elections are open and sequential, and
manipulators may know the already cast votes but may not know the future votes.
We introduce a framework, in which manipulators can see the past votes but not
the future ones, to model online coalitional manipulation of sequential
elections, and we show that in this setting manipulation can be extremely
complex even for election systems with simple winner problems. Yet we also show
that for some of the most important election systems such manipulation is
simple in certain settings. This suggests that when using sequential voting,
one should pay great attention to the details of the setting in choosing one's
voting rule.
  Among the highlights of our classifications are: We show that, depending on
the size of the manipulative coalition, the online manipulation problem can be
complete for each level of the polynomial hierarchy or even for PSPACE. We
obtain the most dramatic contrast to date between the nonunique-winner and
unique-winner models: Online weighted manipulation for plurality is in P in the
nonunique-winner model, yet is coNP-hard (constructive case) and NP-hard
(destructive case) in the unique-winner model. And we obtain what to the best
of our knowledge are the first PNP[1]-completeness and PNP-completeness results
in the field of computational social choice, in particular proving such
completeness for, respectively, the complexity of 3-candidate and 4-candidate

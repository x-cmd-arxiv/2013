  Social Networks","11 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables",,,,"cs.SI cs.LG physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Online social networks have gained great success in recent years and many of
them involve multiple kinds of nodes and complex relationships. Among these
relationships, social links among users are of great importance. Many existing
link prediction methods focus on predicting social links that will appear in
the future among all users based upon a snapshot of the social network. In
real-world social networks, many new users are joining in the service every
day. Predicting links for new users are more important. Different from
conventional link prediction problems, link prediction for new users are more
challenging due to the following reasons: (1) differences in information
distributions between new users and the existing active users (i.e., old
users); (2) lack of information from the new users in the network. We propose a
link prediction method called SCAN-PS (Supervised Cross Aligned Networks link
prediction with Personalized Sampling), to solve the link prediction problem
for new users with information transferred from both the existing active users
in the target network and other source networks through aligned accounts. We
proposed a within-target-network personalized sampling method to process the
existing active users' information in order to accommodate the differences in
information distributions before the intra-network knowledge transfer. SCAN-PS
can also exploit information in other source networks, where the user accounts
are aligned with the target network. In this way, SCAN-PS could solve the cold
start problem when information of these new users is total absent in the target
network.

Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH). Using the Advanced
Camera for Surveys and the Wide Field Camera 3 on the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST), we have imaged 25 galaxy-cluster fields and parallel fields of
non-cluster galaxies. We report a sample of 27 SNe discovered in the parallel
fields. Of these SNe, ~13 are classified as SN Ia candidates, including four SN
Ia candidates at redshifts z > 1.2. We measure volumetric SN Ia rates to
redshift 1.8 and add the first upper limit on the SN Ia rate in the range 1.8 <
z < 2.4. The results are consistent with the rates measured by the HST/GOODS
and Subaru Deep Field SN surveys. We model these results together with previous
measurements at z < 1 from the literature. The best-fitting SN Ia delay-time
distribution (DTD; the distribution of times that elapse between a short burst
of star formation and subsequent SN Ia explosions) is a power law with an index
of -1.00 +0.06(0.09) -0.06(0.10) (statistical) +0.12 -0.08 (systematic), where
the statistical uncertainty is a result of the 68% and 95% (in parentheses)
statistical uncertainties reported for the various SN Ia rates (from this work
and from the literature), and the systematic uncertainty reflects the range of
possible cosmic star-formation histories. We also test DTD models produced by
an assortment of published binary population synthesis (BPS) simulations. The
shapes of all BPS double-degenerate DTDs are consistent with the volumetric SN
Ia measurements, when the DTD models are scaled up by factors of 3-9. In
contrast, all BPS single-degenerate DTDs are ruled out by the measurements at a
>99% significance level.

analyticity is established for solutions to the incompressible, forced
Navier-Stokes system on an n-torus. This estimate improves or matches
previously known estimates provided that certain bounds on the initial data are
satisfied. It is argued that for 2D or 3D turbulent flows, the initial data is
guaranteed to satisfy these hypothesized bounds on a significant portion of the
2D global attractor or the 3D weak attractor. In these scenarios, the estimate
obtained for 3D generalizes and improves upon that of [Doering-Titi], while in
2D, the estimate matches the best known one found in [Kukavica]. A key feature
in the approach taken here is the choice of the Wiener algebra as the phase
space, i.e., the Banach algebra of functions with absolutely convergent Fourier
series, whose structure is suitable for the use of the so-called Gevrey norms.

redshift. With this information, we are able to estimate the redshift evolution
of the total (FUV + FIR) star formation rate density (SFRD_TOT). Our main
conclusions are that: 1) the dust attenuation A_FUV is found to increase from z
= 0 to $z \sim 1.2 and then starts to decrease until our last data point at z =
3.6; 2) the estimated SFRD confirms published results to z \sim 2. At z > 2, we
observe either a plateau or a small increase up to z \sim 3 and then a likely
decrease up to z = 3.6; 3) the peak of A_FUV is delayed with respect to the
plateau of SFRD_TOT but the origin of this delay is not understood yet, and
SPICA instruments will provide clues to move further in the physical
understanding of this delay but also on the detection and redshift measurements
of galaxies at higher redshifts. This work is further detailed in Burgarella et

denoted as JT1 and JT2, are considered. We find FM to ferrimagnetic (FIM) and
FM to AFM magnetic phase transitionn in the JT1 and JT2 type of distortions,
respectively. Larger strains are required for the FM-AFM transition as compared
to the FM-FIM. DFT$+U$ calculations also show that the magnetic moments
dramatically decrease at large strains due to strong overlapping between the Fe

competition between double exchange and superexchange interactions. Oxygen and
Fe displacements are therefore responsible for the magnetic phase transitions

associated probabilities, known as (Jacquard's) identity coefficients. The
genetic relatedness between two individuals can be succinctly characterized by
the identity coefficients corresponding to the joint genealogy. The identity
coefficients (together with allele frequencies) determine the distribution of
joint genotypes at a locus. At a locus with two possible alleles, identity
coefficients are not identifiable because different coefficients can generate
the same genotype distribution.
  We analyze precisely how different IBD modes combine into identical genotype
distributions at diallelic loci. In particular, we describe IBD mode mixtures
that result in identical genotype distributions at all allele frequencies,
implying the non-identifiability of the identity coefficients from independent
loci. Our analysis yields an exhaustive characterization of relatedness
statistics that are always identifiable. Importantly, we show that identifiable
relatedness statistics include the kinship coefficient (probability that a
random pair of alleles are identical by descent between individuals) and
inbreeding-related measures, which can thus be estimated from genotype

The transition is due to a competition between non-perturbative topological
""molecules""---magnetic and neutral bion-instantons---and electrically charged
W-bosons and superpartners. Compared to deconfinement in non-supersymmetric
QCD(adj) arXiv:1112.6389, the novelty is the relevance of the light modulus

serves as an order parameter for the Z_2^{L} center symmetry associated with
the non-thermal circle, and explicitly breaks the electric-magnetic
(Kramers-Wannier) duality enjoyed by non-supersymmetric QCD(adj) near T_c. We
show that deconfinement can be studied using an effective two-dimensional gas
of electric and magnetic charges with (dual) Coulomb and Aharonov-Bohm
interactions, or, equivalently, via an XY-spin model with a symmetry-breaking
perturbation, where each system couples to the scalar field. To study the
realization of the discrete R-symmetry and the Z_2^{beta} thermal and Z_2^{L}
non-thermal center symmetries, we perform Monte Carlo simulations of both
systems. The dual-Coulomb gas simulations are a novel way to analyze
deconfinement and provide a new venue to study the phase structure of a class
of two-dimensional condensed matter models that can be mapped into dual-Coulomb
gases. Our results indicate a continuous deconfinement transition, with Z_2^{L}
remaining unbroken at the transition. Thus, the SYM transition appears similar
to the one in SU(2) QCD(adj) arXiv:1112.6389 and is also likely to be
characterized by continuously varying critical exponents.

state space in which a Boolean network, built from protein interaction and
gene-expression data from different stages of cancer, transits between Boolean
satisfiability states by ""editing"" interactions and ""flipping"" genes. The
application of our model (called BoolSpace) on three case studies - pancreatic
and breast tumours in human and post spinal-cord injury in rats - reveals
valuable insights into the phenomenon of cancer progression. In particular, we
notice that several of the genes flipped are serine/threonine kinases which act
as natural cellular switches and that different sets of genes are flipped
during the initial and final stages indicating a pattern to tumour progression.
We hypothesize that robustness of cancer partly stems from ""passing of the
baton"" between genes at different stages, and therefore an effective therapy
should target a ""cover set"" of these genes. A C/C++ implementation of BoolSpace

initial state correlations created by structures local in configuration space
are collimated by transverse flow, and models where the azimuthal correlation
is created through local partonic interactions in a high gluon density initial
state.
  We further argue that the key to distinguish these two scenarios is to
experimentally examine the role flow plays in the ridge. The measurement of a
strong double ridge in $pA$ and $dA$ collisions allows a good opportunity to
understand the ridge's origin. In this sense, particle-identified correlations
are particularly promising way of testing the assumptions at the base of either
of the two models above.
  The successful fit of the pA ridge by hydrodynamic models \cite{us},
therefore, suggests that the ridge is primarily a ""final state effect""

non-trivial to reconcile with hydrodynamic expectations. We close by discussing
experimental observables capable of clarifying the situation.

secret keys. In the exploration of ultimate limits to such protocols, the
property of symmetric extendibility of underlying bipartite states $\rho_{AB}$
plays an important role. A bipartite state $\rho_{AB}$ is symmetric extendible
if there exits a tripartite state $\rho_{ABB'}$, such that the $AB$ marginal
state is identical to the $AB'$ marginal state, i.e. $\rho_{AB'}=\rho_{AB}$.
For a symmetric extendible state $\rho_{AB}$, the first task of the public
discussion protocol is to break this symmetric extendibility. Therefore to
characterize all bi-partite quantum states that possess symmetric extensions is
of vital importance. We prove a simple analytical formula that a two-qubit
state $\rho_{AB}$ admits a symmetric extension if and only if
$\tr(\rho_B^2)\geq \tr(\rho_{AB}^2)-4\sqrt{\det{\rho_{AB}}}$. Given the
intimate relationship between the symmetric extension problem and the quantum

features, not least of which is the explicit rendering of information about the
relative phases in any filtering imposed on the signal, thus making holography
a more straightforward proposition. Here we present methods for determining
optimum estimates of both the filter itself and the statistics of the
unfiltered signal, starting from a measured cyclic spectrum. In the context of
radio pulsars these quantities tell us the impulse response of the interstellar

application to 428 MHz Arecibo data on the millisecond pulsar B1937+21,

As expected, the intrinsic profile exhibits main- and inter-pulse components

some weak, but sharp features that are revealed for the first time at low

On the other hand, a
symmetry protected topological (SPT) charge is a topological number only when a
symmetry exists. We propose a formula for the SPT charge as a derivative of the
Chern number in terms of the Green function in such a way that it is valid and
related to the associated Hall current even when the symmetry is broken. We
estimate the amount of deviation from the quantized value as a function of the
strength of the broken symmetry. We present two examples. First, we consider
Dirac electrons with the spin-orbit coupling on honeycomb lattice, where the
SPT charges are given by the spin-Chern, valley-Chern and spin-valley-Chern
numbers. Though the spin-Chern charge is not quantized in the presence of the
Rashba coupling, the deviation is estimated to be $10^{-7}$ in the case of
silicene, a silicon cousin of graphene. Second, we analyze the effect of the
mirror-symmetry breaking of the mirror-Chern number in a thin-film of
topological crystalline insulator.

this discrete symmetry can be rigorously reformulated by the invariance of

shown in Deep Core) by ten over one neutrino (muon) events over showers. This

Catalog. We apply specific forms of Ohm's law on the open field lines using a
broad range for the macroscopic conductivity values that result in solutions
ranging, from near-vacuum to near Force-Free. Using these solutions, we
generate model $\gamma$-ray light curves by calculating realistic trajectories
and Lorentz factors of radiating particles, under the influence of both the
accelerating electric fields and curvature radiation-reaction. We further
constrain our models using the observed dependence of the phase-lags between
the radio and $\gamma$-ray emission on the $\gamma$-ray peak-separation. We
perform a statistical comparison of our model radio-lag vs peak-separation
diagram and the one obtained for the Fermi standard pulsars. We find that for
models of uniform conductivity over the entire open magnetic field line region,
agreement with observations favors higher values of this parameter. We find,
however, significant improvement in fitting the data with models that employ a
hybrid form of conductivity; specifically, infinite conductivity interior to
the light-cylinder and high but finite conductivity on the outside. In these
models the $\gamma$-ray emission is produced in regions near the equatorial
current sheet but modulated by the local physical properties. These models have
radio-lags near the observed values and statistically best reproduce the
observed light-curve phenomenology. Additionally, these models produce GeV
photon cut-off energies.

peaks can be optimized with efficiencies higher than 95%. Moreover, those
absorption peaks are insensitive to both polarization and incident angle. The
influences of the geometrical parameters along with the refractive index of the
dielectric on the device performance are discussed as well. Furthermore, it is
found that the number of absorption peaks within each photonic band exactly
corresponds to the number of the unit cells because the truncated photonic
crystal lattices have the function of selecting resonant modes. It is also
displayed that the total absorption efficiency gradually increases when there
are more metal-dielectric unit cells placing on top of the metallic substrate.

Bubbles, with eight ~20 ksec pointings across the northern part of the North
Polar Spur (NPS) surrounding the north bubble and six across the southernmost
edge of the south bubble. After removing compact X-ray features, diffuse X-ray
emission is clearly detected and is well reproduced by a three-component
spectral model consisting of unabsorbed thermal emission (temperature kT ~0.1
keV from the Local Bubble (LB), absorbed kT ~0.3 keV thermal emission related
to the NPS and/or Galactic Halo (GH), and a power-law component at a level
consistent with the cosmic X-ray background. The emission measure (EM) of the
0.3 keV plasma decreases by ~50% toward the inner regions of the north-east
bubble, with no accompanying temperature change. However, such a jump in the EM
is not clearly seen in the south bubble data. While it is unclear if the NPS
originates from a nearby supernova remnant or is related to previous activity
within/around the Galactic Center, our Suzaku observations provide evidence
suggestive of the latter scenario. In the latter framework, the presence of a
large amount of neutral matter absorbing the X-ray emission as well as the
existence of the kT ~ 0.3 keV gas can be naturally interpreted as a weak shock
driven by the bubbles' expansion in the surrounding medium, with velocity v_exp
~300 km/s (corresponding to shock Mach number M ~1.5), compressing the GH gas
to form the NPS feature. We also derived an upper limit for any non-thermal
X-ray emission component associated with the bubbles and demonstrate, that in
agreement with the findings above, the non-thermal pressure and energy
estimated from a one-zone leptonic model of its broad-band spectrum, are in
rough equilibrium with that of the surrounding thermal plasma.

Near the superfluid phase transition with critical temperature $T_{c}$, the

trap, we predict that the mode frequency diverges like
$(1-T/T_{c})^{\beta-1/2}$ when $\beta<1/2$. In a highly elongated trap, the
speed of second sound reduces by a factor $1/\sqrt{2\beta+1}$ from that in a

called elliptical component analysis (ECA) --- for analyzing high dimensional,
elliptically distributed data. ECA estimates the eigenspace of the covariance
matrix of the elliptical data. To cope with heavy-tailed elliptical
distributions, a multivariate rank statistic is exploited. At the model-level,
we consider two settings: either that the leading eigenvectors of the
covariance matrix are non-sparse or that they are sparse. Methodologically, we
propose ECA procedures for both non-sparse and sparse settings. Theoretically,
we provide both non-asymptotic and asymptotic analyses quantifying the
theoretical performances of ECA. In the non-sparse setting, we show that ECA's
performance is highly related to the effective rank of the covariance matrix.
In the sparse setting, the results are twofold: (i) We show that the sparse ECA
estimator based on a combinatoric program attains the optimal rate of
convergence; (ii) Based on some recent developments in estimating sparse
leading eigenvectors, we show that a computationally efficient sparse ECA
estimator attains the optimal rate of convergence under a suboptimal scaling.

of matrix models, in particular collective field theory and loop equations. In
the first part of these notes, we explain how the results of collective field
theory can be derived from the cluster expansion. The equalities between free

relating canonical and grand canonical models. In a second part, we study the

transients. In previous work, an abstract cycle-to-cycle mapping function
coupled with $\epsilon$-Support Vector Regression was shown to predict
experimentally observed cycle-to-cycle combustion timing over a wide range of
engine conditions, despite some of the aforementioned difficulties. The main
limitation of the previous approach was that a partially acausual randomly

proposing a new online adaptive Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) extension named
Weighted Ring-ELM. This extension enables fully causal combustion timing
predictions at randomly chosen engine set points, and is shown to achieve
results that are as good as or better than the previous offline method. The
broader objective of this approach is to enable a new class of real-time model

accelerated along the magnetic field lines, improving previous estimates that

metric graph, called an interface SDE $(\hbox{ISDE})$. To each edge of the
graph is associated an independent white noise, which drives $(\hbox{ISDE})$ on
this edge. This produces an interface at each vertex of the graph. We first do
our study on star graphs with $N\ge 2$ rays. The case $N=2$ corresponds to the
perturbed Tanaka's equation recently studied by Prokaj \cite{MR18} and Le
Jan-Raimond \cite{MR000} among others. It is proved that $(\hbox{ISDE})$ has a
unique in law solution, which is a Walsh's Brownian motion. This solution is
strong if and only if $N=2$.
  Solution flows are also considered. There is a (unique in law) coalescing
stochastic flow of mappings $\p$ solving $(\hbox{ISDE})$. For $N=2$, it is the
only solution flow. For $N\ge 3$, $\p$ is not a strong solution and by
filtering $\p$ with respect to the family of white noises, we obtain a (Wiener)
stochastic flow of kernels solution of $(\hbox{ISDE})$. There are no other
Wiener solutions. Our previous results \cite{MR501011} in hand, these results
are extended to more general metric graphs.
  The proofs involve the study of $(X,Y)$ a Brownian motion in a two
dimensional quadrant obliquely reflected at the boundary, with time dependent
angle of reflection. We prove in particular that, when $(X\_0,Y\_0)=(1,0)$ and
if $S$ is the first time $X$ hits $0$, then $Y\_S^2$ is a beta random variable
of the second kind. We also calculate $\EE[L\_{\sigma\_0}]$, where $L$ is the
local time accumulated at the boundary, and $\sigma\_0$ is the first time
$(X,Y)$ hits $(0,0)$.

grid spurs the need for efficient charging coordination mechanisms. It can be
shown that the optimal charging schedule smooths out the energy consumption
over time so as to minimize the total energy cost. In practice, however, it is
hard to smooth out the energy consumption perfectly, because the future PEV
charging demand is unknown at the moment when the charging rate of an existing

strictly feasible in the sense that it guarantees to fulfill all charging
demands before due time. Meanwhile, it achieves the best known competitive
ratio of 2.39. To further reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm,
we propose a novel reduced-complexity algorithm to replace the standard convex
optimization techniques used in ORCHARD. Through extensive simulations, we show
that the average performance gap between ORCHARD and the offline optimal
solution, which utilizes the complete future information, is as small as 14%.
By setting a proper speeding factor, the average performance gap can be further
reduced to less than 6%.

to bring the contents closer to the consumers, reduce the load on producers and
decrease the unnecessary retransmission for ISPs. Nevertheless, the existing
cache management scheme for the network of caches obtain poor performance. The
main reason for performance degradation in a network of caches is the filter
effect of the replacement policy. A cache serves the requests that generate
cache-hits and forwards the requests that generate cache-misses. This filtering
changes the pattern of requests and leads to decreased hit ratios in the
subsequent caches. In this paper, we propose a coordinated caching scheme to
solve the filter effect problem by introducing the selection policy. This
policy manages a cache such that: i) the cache obtains a high hit ratio ii) the
missed requests from the cache can be used by subsequent caches to obtain a
high hit ratio. Our coordinated selection scheme achieves an overall hit ratio
of a network of caches equivalent to that of edge routers with big caches.
Moreover, our scheme decreases the average number of evictions per cache slot
by four order of magnitude compared to the LRU universal caching.

combining multiple solutions to the underlying equations with varying numbers

Our contributions are threefold: Firstly, given a family of linear systems
possibly containing unstable dynamics, we propose a large class of switching
signals that stabilize a switched system generated by the switching signal and
the given family of systems. Secondly, given a switched system, a sufficient
condition for the existence of the proposed switching signal is derived by
expressing the switching signal as an infinite walk on a directed graph

zone defined as a function of planet orbital elements. This orbital HZ is
better equipped to handle (for example) eccentric planet orbits, and is more
directly connected to the data returned by exoplanet observations.
  Producing an orbital HZ requires a large number of climate simulations to be
run to investigate the parameter space - we achieve this using Latitudinal
Energy Balance Models (LEBMs), which handle the insolation of the planet by
both stars (including mutual eclipses), as well as the planetary atmosphere's
ability to absorb, transfer and lose heat.
  We present orbital HZs for several known circumbinary planetary systems:
Kepler-16, Kepler-34, Kepler-35, Kepler-47 and PH-1. Generally, the orbital HZs
at zero eccentricity are consistent with spatial HZs derived by other authors,
although we detect some signatures of variability that coincide with resonances
between the binary and planet orbital periods. We confirm that Earthlike
planets around Kepler-47 with Kepler-47c's orbital parameters could possess
liquid water, despite current uncertainties regarding its eccentricity.
Kepler-16b is found to be outside the habitable zone, as well as the other

30{\deg}-110{\deg} and a paucity between 120{\deg}-180{\deg}. The explanation
of the non-isotropic distribution is unknown at this point. Further studies
have to be conducted to determine if the shape of the distribution can be
explained by observational bias, selection effects, a real physical process or
other mechanism.

directly expressed in terms of atomic displacements under mechanical load, such
that one can determine if mechanical strain is varying smoothly at each unit
cell, and the extent to which sublattice symmetry holds. Since strain deforms
lattice vectors at each unit cell, orthogonality between lattice and reciprocal
lattice vectors leads to renormalization of the reciprocal lattice vectors as
well, making the $K$ and $K'$ points shift in opposite directions. From this
observation we conclude that no $K-$dependent gauges enter on a first-order
theory. In this formulation of the theory the deformation potential and
pseudo-magnetic field take discrete values at each graphene unit cell. We
illustrate the formalism by providing strain-generated fields and local density
of electronic states on graphene membranes with large numbers of atoms. The
present method complements and goes beyond the prevalent approach, where strain

approximated by nearly prolate ellipsoids of revolution. An equally fundamental
property is the shape of these objects in velocity space which is the
anisotropy of the global velocity dispersion tensor. Here we make use of
kinematical data comprising around 600 nearby clusters and rich groups of
galaxies from the SDSS to place constraints on the phase-space shapes of these
objects, i.e. their shapes in both position and velocity space. We show that
the line of sight velocity dispersion normalised by a mass dependent velocity
scale correlates with the apparent elongation, with circular (elongated)
clusters exhibiting an excessive (decremental) normalised velocity dispersion.
This correlation holds for dynamically young or old clusters and, therefore, it
originates from projecting their intrinsic phase-space shapes rather than from
dynamical evolution. It signifies that clusters are preferentially prolate not
only in position space, but also in velocity space. The distribution of the
axial ratios in position space is found to be well approximated by a Gaussian
with a mean 0.66+/-0.01 and a dispersion 0.07+/-0.008. The velocity ellipsoids
representing the shapes in velocity space are more spherical, with a mean axial
ratio of 0.78+/-0.03. This finding has important implications for mass
measurements based on the line of sight velocity dispersion profiles in
individual clusters. For typical axial ratios of the velocity ellipsoids in the
analysed cluster sample, systematic errors on the mass estimates inferred from
the line of sight velocity dispersions become comparable to statistical
uncertainties for galaxy clusters with as few as 40 spectroscopic redshifts.

the tritium depth distributions should not be simply adjusted to fit the

Cluster of StarS (EMACSS). The first version (Alexander & Gieles) assumed that
cluster evolution is balanced for the majority of the life-cycle, meaning that
the rate of energy generation in the core of the cluster equals the diffusion
rate of energy by two-body relaxation, which makes the code suitable for
modelling clusters in weak tidal fields. In this new version we extend the
model to include an unbalanced phase of evolution to describe the pre-collapse
evolution and the accompanying escape rate such that clusters in strong tidal
fields can also be modelled. We also add a prescription for the evolution of
the core radius and density and a related cluster concentration parameter. The
model simultaneously solves a series of first-order ordinary differential
equations for the rate of change of the core radius, half-mass radius and the
number of member stars N. About two thousand integration steps in time are
required to solve for the entire evolution of a star cluster and this number is
approximately independent of N. We compare the model to the variation of these
parameters following from a series of direct N-body calculations of single-mass
clusters and find good agreement in the evolution of all parameters. Relevant
time-scales, such as the total lifetimes and core collapse times, are
reproduced with an accuracy of about 10% for clusters with various initial
half-mass radii (relative to their Jacobi radii) and a range of different
initial N up to N = 65536. We intend to extend this framework to include more
realistic initial conditions, such as a stellar mass spectrum and mass loss
from stars. The EMACSS code can be used in star cluster population studies and
in models that consider the co-evolution of (globular) star clusters and large
scale structures.

Hadron Collider (LHC) is quite low. One usually think that it is extremely
important for the measurement of triple Higgs coupling at the high luminosity
LHC. In this paper, we propose to search for the extra Higgs boson (denoted as
$S$) utilizing pair production of the SM-like Higgs boson ($H$) which was
discovered in July, 2012.The pair production of $H$ can be huge due to the
resonant production of heavy scalar $S$, namely $PP \rightarrow S \rightarrow
HH$. The couplings of $H$ with weak gauge boson are similar to ones in the SM
and it implies that the couplings between $S$ and gauge bosons are likely
suppressed. Provided that $S$ is heavy enough, the decay into weak gauge bosons
may not be the dominant modes. Instead $S$ can decay into a pair of $H$ and
offer the promising channel to discover it. In this paper, we studied the 5
promising decay modes of $H$, i.e. $b\bar{b}$, $WW^*$, $ZZ^*$, $\gamma\gamma$
and $\tau^+\tau^-$, and simulated the signals and backgrounds for the 15
combination modes for $HH$ at the LHC with $\sqrt{s}= 14$ TeV and integrated
luminosity $\mathcal{L}=1000fb^{-1}$. We found that with the help of suitable
selection rules, very good signal to background ratio $S/B$ can be archived in
many decay channels, for example $b\bar b+ (WW^*, ZZ^*, \gamma\gamma,
\tau^+\tau^-)$, $WW^*+(WW^*, ZZ^*, \gamma\gamma, \tau^+\tau^-)$ and
$\tau^+\tau^- +(\gamma\gamma, \tau^+\tau^-)$. For the detailed results please
refer to Table \ref{tab:discovery} in the text. On the contrary, $b\bar b b\bar
b$ mode is less important due to the huge QCD background. However if one has
excellent control on light jet mis-tagging, the $b\bar b b\bar b$ mode can be

summarize the situation after the first and very successful data taking period
of the LHC. The discovery of a Higgs boson and results from searches for
additional MSSM Higgs bosons from the ATLAS and CMS, have recently led to a
proposal of new low-energy MSSM benchmark scenarios. The CED signal cross

investigate the magnetic exchange interaction of Fe clusters on Rh(111) and
Ru(0001). We consider dimers, trimers, tetramers, and pentamers of different
shape in fcc and hcp stacking as well as infinite atomic and biatomic chains.
From the dimer calculations we extract the exchange interaction as a function
of adatom distance by mapping total energies to a Heisenberg model. The
nearest-neighbor (NN) exchange constant is about one order of magnitude smaller
than reported for other substrates due to the strong hybridization between the
Fe atoms and the partly filled $4d$-band of the surface. We also find a
transition from a ferromagnetic NN exchange interaction for Fe dimers on
Rh(111) to an antiferromagnetic one on Ru(0001). The distance-dependent
exchange coupling displays a RKKY-like oscillatory behavior which is nearly
inverted for Fe dimers on the Rh(111) surface compared to those on Ru(0001).
Unexpectedly, for Fe clusters beyond dimers, a complex trend of the magnetic
ground state is observed which alternates between ferro- and antiferromagnetic
configurations depending on cluster size and shape. In view of the exchange
constants obtained for dimers, it is surprising that on both surfaces small
compact clusters are ferromagnetic while open structures such as linear trimers
or tetramers become antiferromagnetic. We demonstrate that both vertical and
lateral structural relaxations of the clusters are crucial in order to
understand this unexpected trend of magnetic order and connected to the
competition of direct ferromagnetic exchange among Fe atoms in the cluster and
the hybridization with the substrate.

momentum). This joint resummation induces strong suppression of the pion wave
function in the small $x$ and large $b$ regions, $b$ being the impact parameter
conjugate to $k_T$, and improves the applicability of perturbative QCD to hard
exclusive processes. The above effect is similar to those from the conventional

that QCD logarithmic corrections to a process must be handled appropriately,

peak density of $\rm 7 \times 10^{-10} g/cm^{3}$. Our findings show that
irrespective of the initial seed field, the magnetic field strength reaches a
saturated state in the presence of strong accretion shocks. Under such
conditions, the growth time becomes very short and amplification occurs rapidly
within a small fraction of the free-fall time. We find that the presence of
such strong magnetic fields provides additional support against gravity and
helps in suppressing fragmentation. Massive clumps of a few hundred solar
masses are formed at the end of our simulations and high accretion rates of
$\rm 1 M_{\odot}/yr$ are observed. We expect that in the presence of such
accretion rates, the clumps will grow to form supermassive stars of $\rm \sim
10^{5} M_{\odot}$. Overall, the role of the magnetic fields seems supportive
for the formation of massive black holes.

understand the relations between their geometry and topology. The lattice
cohomology is an important tool in the study of topological properties of a
plumbed 3-manifold M associated with a connected negative definite plumbing
graph G. It connects the topological properties with analytic ones when M is
realized as a singularity link, i.e. when G is a good resolution graph of the
singularity. Its computation is based on the (Riemann-Roch) weights of the
lattice points of \Z^s, where s is the number of vertices of G. The first part
of the thesis reduces the rank of this lattice to the number of `bad' vertices
of the graph. Usually, the geometry/topology of M is encoded exactly by these
`bad' vertices and their number measures how far the plumbing graph stays from
a rational one. In the second part, we identify the following three objects:
the Seiberg-Witten invariant of a plumbed 3-manifold, the periodic constant of
its topological Poincare series, and a coefficient of an equivariant
multivariable Ehrhart polynomial. For this, we construct the corresponding
polytope from the plumbing graph, together with an action of H_1(M,\Z), and we
develop Ehrhart theory for them. The effect of the reduction appears also at
the level of the multivariable topological Poincare series, simplifying the
corresponding polytope and the Ehrhart theory as well. We end the thesis with
detailed calculations and examples.

advancement of chemical abundances studies in photoionized nebulae, such as H
II regions and planetary nebulae (PNe). Classical analyses make use of the
intensity of bright collisionally excited lines (CELs), which have a strong
dependence on the electron temperature and density. By using high resolution
spectrophotometric data, our group has led the determination of chemical
abundances of some heavy element ions, mainly O++, O+ and C++ from faint
recombination lines (RLs), allowing us to deblend them from other nearby
emission lines or sky features. The importance of these lines is that their
emissivity depends weakly on the temperature and density structure of the gas.
The unresolved issue in this field is that recombination lines of heavy element
ions give abundances that are about 2-3 times higher than those derived from
CELs -in H II regions- for the same ion, and can even be a factor of 70 times
higher in some PNe. This uncertainty puts into doubt the validity of face
values of metallicity that we use as representative not only for ionized
nebulae in the Local Universe, but also for star-forming dwarf and spiral
galaxies at different redshifts. Additionally, high-resolution data can allow
us to detect and deblend faint lines of neutron capture element ions in PNe.
This information would introduce further restrictions to evolution models of
AGBs and would help to quantify the chemical enrichment in s-elements produced
by low and intermediate mass stars. The availability of an echelle spectrograph
at the E-ELT will be of paramount interest to: (a) extend the studies of heavy
element recombination lines to low metallicity objects, (b) to extend abundance
determinations of s-elements to planetary nebulae in the extragalactic domain

located in the spiral arms of NGC 628 are identified and studied. We find that
the star formation regions in one (longer) arm are systematically brighter and
larger than the regions in the other (shorter) arm. However, both luminosity
and size distribution functions have approximately the same slopes for the
samples of star formation regions in both arms. The star formation regions in
the longer arm have a higher star formation rate density than the regions in
the shorter arm. The regions in the shorter arm show higher N/O ratio at a
higher oxygen abundance, but they have lower ultraviolet and H-alpha?
luminosities. These findings can be explained if we assume that star formation
regions in the shorter arm had higher star formation rate in the past, but now
it is lower than for those in the opposite arm. Results of stellar evolutionary
synthesis show that the brightest regions in the longer arm are slightly
younger than the ones in the shorter arm (3.5+-2.2 Myr versus 6.0+-1.1 Myr).

photon-tagged jet fragmentation function are investigated by comparing prompt
photon-tagged hadron azimuthal correlation in Au+Au collisions (0-40\%) with
that in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\rm NN}}}$ = 200 GeV. The measured
modification factor, $I_{AA}$, increases with the increasing integration range
of the away side, which reveals a medium-modified jet shape in which the medium
enhancement of soft particles is preferentially located far away from the jet
axis. The $I_{AA}$ largely results from strong interactions between jets and
partonic matter. However, both hadronization of coalescence and hadronic
rescatterings play certain roles to modify the $I_{AA}$. These behaviors
reflect a dynamical evolution of modifications of the prompt photon-tagged jet
fragmentation function in high-energy heavy-ion collisions.

category to a Laurent polynomial ring over the integers. In the case of a
cluster category, it maps ""reachable"" indecomposable objects to the
corresponding cluster variables in a cluster algebra. This formalises the idea
that the cluster category is a ""categorification"" of the cluster algebra.
  The definition of the Caldero-Chapoton map requires the category to be
2-Calabi-Yau, and the map depends on a cluster tilting object in the category.
  We study a modified version of the Caldero-Chapoton map which only requires
the category to have a Serre functor, and only depends on a rigid object in the
category.
  It is well-known that the usual Caldero-Chapoton map gives rise to so-called
friezes, for instance Conway-Coxeter friezes. We show that the modified
Caldero-Chapoton map gives rise to what we call generalised friezes, and that
for cluster categories of Dynkin type A, it recovers the generalised friezes
introduced by combinatorial means by Bessenrodt and us.

quasi-one-dimensional wire by Frolov et al. [Nature (London) 458, 868 (2009)].
The spin resonance was generated by a combination of an external static
magnetic field and the oscillating effective spin-orbit magnetic field due to
periodic bouncings of the electrons off the boundaries of a narrow channel. An
increase of the D'yakonov-Perel spin relaxation rate was observed when the
frequency of the spin-orbit field matched that of the Larmor precession
frequency around the external magnetic field. Here we develop a model to
account for the D'yakonov-Perel mechanism in multisubband quantum wires with
both the Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions. Considering elastic
spin-conserving impurity scatterings in the time-evolution operator (Heisenberg
representation), we extract the spin relaxation time by evaluating the
time-dependent average of the spin operators. The magnetic field dependence of
the nonlocal voltage, which is related to the spin relaxation time behavior,
shows a wide plateau, in agreement with the experimental observation. This
plateau arises due to injection in higher subbands and small-angle scattering.
In this quantum mechanical approach, the spin resonance occurs near the
spin-orbit induced energy anticrossings of the quantum wire subbands with
opposite spins. We also predict anomalous dips in the spin relaxation time as a
function of the magnetic field in systems with strong spin-orbit couplings.

two-component Bose gas on a disk, the complete strongly correlated regime,
extending from the integer phase at filling factor $\nu=2$ to the Halperin
phase at filling factor $\nu=2/3$, is well described by composite
fermionization of the bosons. Moreover we study the edge excitations of the IQH

find that the quantized vortex lines tend to concentrate close to the solid

the balance of two competing effects, namely the rate of turbulent diffusion of
an isotropic tangle near the boundaries and the rate of quantized-vorticity
production at the centre. Moreover, this yields the observed scaling of the
position of the peak vortex line density with the mutual friction parameter.

flow. A distributed system composed of interacting processes implicitly defines
an intransitive security policy by repudiating direct information flow between
processes that do not exchange messages directly. We show that implicitly
defined security policies in distributed systems are enforced, provided that
processes run in separation, and possible process communication on a technical
platform is restricted to specified message paths of the system. Furthermore,
we propose to further restrict the allowable information flow by adding filter
functions for controlling which messages may be transmitted between processes,
and we prove that locally checking filter functions is sufficient for ensuring
global security policies. Altogether, global intransitive security policies are
established by means of local verification conditions for the (trusted)
processes of the distributed system. Moreover, security policies may be
implemented securely on distributed integration platforms which ensure
partitioning. We illustrate our results with a smart grid case study, where we
use CTL model checking for discharging local verification conditions for each
process under consideration.

re-discovery of low-density parity-check codes a few years later, the field of
channel coding has experienced a number of major advances. Up until that time,
code designers were usually happy with performance that came within a few
decibels of the Shannon Limit, primarily due to implementation complexity
constraints, whereas the new coding techniques now allow performance within a
small fraction of a decibel of capacity with modest encoding and decoding
complexity. Due to these significant improvements, coding standards in
applications as varied as wireless mobile transmission, satellite TV, and deep
space communication are being updated to incorporate the new techniques. In
this paper, we review a particularly exciting new class of low-density
parity-check codes, called spatially-coupled codes, which promise excellent
performance over a broad range of channel conditions and decoded error rate
requirements.

we derive laws of NHEG dynamics, the analogs of laws of black hole dynamics for
the NHEG. Despite the absence of horizon in the NHEG, one may associate an
entropy to the NHEG, as a Noether-Wald conserved charge. We work out entropy

between conserved Noether charges corresponding to the NHEG and a system
probing the NHEG. Our entropy law is closely related to Sen's entropy function.

a BCC structure. Finally we study the relaxation dynamics of the system by

from a gel to a fluid upon both heating and cooling, encountering neither
demixing nor phase separation.

carried out a visualization experiment for the very near wall region of a
turbulent pipe flow that, together with the turbulent boundary layer
visualization of Kline et al., excited the turbulence research community. Using
a high speed movie camera mounted on a lathe bed that recorded magnified images
in a frame of reference moving with the flow, they observed the motions of
sub-micron particles in the sub-, buffer- and log-layers. Surprisingly, these
motions were not nearly so locally random as was the general view of turbulence
at the time. Rather, connected regions of the near wall flow decelerated and
then erupted away from the wall in what they called ""ejections"". These
decelerated motions were followed by larger scale connected motions toward the
wall from above that they called ""sweeps"". They estimated that ejections
accounted for $70\%$ of the Reynolds shear stress at $Re_d = 20,000$ while only
occurring about $18\%$ of the time. This fluid dynamics video shows short
sequences, at three Reynolds numbers, from the original Corino and Brodkey
visual study. In the following decades it inspired numerous laboratory and
simulation studies aimed at unraveling the structure of bounded turbulent flows
and understanding the turbulent transport processes within them.

multiscale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) lung model. The three-dimensional
(3D) airway geometry beginning from the mouth to about 7 generations of airways
is reconstructed from the multi-detector row computed tomography (MDCT) image
at the total lung capacity (TLC). Along with the segmented lobe surfaces, we
can build an anatomically-consistent one-dimensional (1D) airway tree spanning
over more than 20 generations down to the terminal bronchioles, which is
specific to the CT resolved airways and lobes (J Biomech 43(11): 2159-2163,
2010). We then register two lung images at TLC and the functional residual
capacity (FRC) to specify subject-specific CFD flow boundary conditions and
deform the airway surface mesh for a breathing lung simulation (J Comput Phys
244:168-192, 2013). The 1D airway tree bridges the 3D CT-resolved airways and
the registration-derived regional ventilation in the lung parenchyma, thus a
multiscale model. Large eddy simulation (LES) is applied to simulate airflow in
a breathing lung (Phys Fluids 21:101901, 2009). In this fluid dynamics video,
we present the distributions of velocity, pressure, vortical structure, and
wall shear stress in a breathing lung model of a normal human subject with a
tidal volume of 500 ml and a period of 4.8 s. On exhalation, air streams from
child branches merge in the parent branch, inducing oscillatory jets and
elongated vortical tubes. On inhalation, the glottal constriction induces
turbulent laryngeal jet. The sites where high wall shear stress tends to occur
on the airway surface are identified for future investigation of
mechanotransduction.

disks having a measurable amount of cold molecular gas. With the goal of
understanding the physical state, origin, and evolution of the gas in young
debris disks, we obtained CO line observations with the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Here we report on the detection of 12CO
and 13CO in the J=2-1 and J=3-2 transitions and C18O in the J=2-1 line. The gas
exhibits a Keplerian velocity curve, one of the few direct measurements of
Keplerian rotation in young debris disks. The measured CO brightness
distribution could be reproduced by a simple star+disk system, whose parameters
are r_in < 26 AU, r_out = 138 +/- 20 AU, M_*=1.8 +0.5 -0.2 M_Sun, and i = 32.6
+/- 3.1 degrees. The total CO mass, as calculated from the optically thin C18O
line, is about (4-8) x 10^-2 M_Earth, while the CO line ratios suggest a
radiation temperature on the order of 6-9 K. Comparing our results with those
obtained for the dust component of the HD 21997 disk from the ALMA continuum
observations by Mo\'or et al., we conclude that comparable amounts of CO gas
and dust are present in the disk. Interestingly, the gas and dust in the HD
21997 system are not co-located, indicating a dust-free inner gas disk within
55 AU of the star. We explore two possible scenarios for the origin of the gas.
A secondary origin, which involves gas production from colliding or active
planetesimals, would require unreasonably high gas production rates and would
not explain why the gas and dust are not co-located. We propose that HD 21997
is a hybrid system where secondary debris dust and primordial gas coexist. HD
21997, whose age exceeds both the model predictions for disk clearing and the
ages of the oldest T Tauri-like or transitional gas disks in the literature,
may be a key object linking the primordial and the debris phases of disk
evolution.

Herschel Space Observatory observations of one of these disks, around HD 21997,
and study the distribution and origin of the dust and its connection to the
gas. Our ALMA continuum images at 886um clearly resolve a broad ring of
emission within a diameter of ~4.5 arcsec, adding HD 21997 to the dozen debris
disks resolved at (sub)millimeter wavelengths. Modeling the morphology of the
ALMA image with a radiative transfer code suggests inner and outer radii of ~55
and ~150 AU, and a dust mass of 0.09 M_Earth. Our data and modeling hints at an
extended cold outskirt of the ring. Comparison with the morphology of the CO
gas in the disk reveals an inner dust-free hole where gas nevertheless can be
detected. Based on dust grain lifetimes, we propose that the dust content of
this gaseous disk is of secondary origin produced by planetesimals. Since the
gas component is probably primordial, HD 21997 is one of the first known
examples of a hybrid circumstellar disk, a so-far little studied late phase of
circumstellar disk evolution.

of time scales between local and global dynamics and therefore it carries over
to other nonequilibrium processes in physics, biology, ecology, and social

represented as a discrete and continuous superposition of normalizable and
non-normalizable eigenfunctions via the spectral transform associated with a
singular Sturm-Liouville operator. We present a new algorithm for computing the
spectral density function of the operator that uses Chebyshev polynomials to
extrapolate the value of the Titchmarsh-Weyl $m$-function from the complex
upper half-plane to the real axis. The eigenfunctions and density function are
rescaled and a new formula for the limiting value of the $m$-function is
derived to avoid amplification of roundoff errors when the solution is
reconstructed. The complexity of the algorithm is also analyzed, showing that
the cost of computing the spectral density function at a point grows less
rapidly than any fractional inverse power of the desired accuracy. A WKB
analysis is used to prove that the spectral density function is real analytic.
Using this new algorithm, we highlight key properties of the partial
differential equation and its solution that have strong implications on the
optimal choice of discretization method in large-scale plasma physics
computations.

We propose a novel structure with GaSb/GaAs type-II QD absorber embedded in the
p-doped region of ideal solar cell, but spatially separated from the depletion
region. We developed the model and used the detailed balance principle along
with Poisson and continuity equations for calculating of the energy band
bending along with the photocurrent and the dark current, and the conversion
efficiency of the cell. Our model takes into account both single-photon and
double-photon absorption as well as non-radiative processes in QDs and predicts
that oncentration from 1-sun to 500-sun raises the efficiency from 30% to 50%.
We showed that accumulation of charge in the QD absorber is the clue to
understanding of potentially superior performance of the proposed solar cell.
An attractive feature of the proposed solar cell is that QDs do not reduce the
open circuit voltage but facilitate generation of the additional photocurrent
to the extent that photovoltaic characteristics reduce to that of ideal IB
solar cell while the efficiency meets the Luque-Marti limit. It should be noted
that, although non-radiative processes like relaxation in QDs and recombination
through QDs degrade photovoltaic characteristics of the proposed solar cell,
its conversion efficiency is still predicted to be above the Shockley-Queisser
limit by 5% to 10%. This study is an important step toward producing practical
solar cells that benefit from additional photocurrent generated by sub-band gap
photons.

A recent, novel application of phase-plane analysis is employed to analyze the
singular traveling wave equations of three of the GCH NLPDEs, i.e. the possible
non-smooth peakon and cuspon solutions. One of the considered GCH equations
supports both solitary (peakon) and periodic (cuspon) cusp waves in different
parameter regimes. The second equation does not support singular traveling
waves and the last one supports four-segmented, non-smooth $M$-wave solutions.
  Moreover, smooth traveling waves of the three GCH equations are considered.
Here, we use a recent technique to derive convergent multi-infinite series
solutions for the homoclinic orbits of their traveling-wave equations,
corresponding to pulse (kink or shock) solutions respectively of the original
PDEs. We perform many numerical tests in different parameter regime to pinpoint
real saddle equilibrium points of the corresponding GCH equations, as well as
ensure simultaneous convergence and continuity of the multi-infinite series
solutions for the homoclinic orbits anchored by these saddle points. Unlike the
majority of unaccelerated convergent series, high accuracy is attained with
relatively few terms. We also show the traveling wave nature of these pulse and
front solutions to the GCH NLPDEs.

restricting the distortion in every image coefficient at some particular image
representation. Geometrically, this implies allowing arbitrary signal
distortions in an $n$-dimensional rectangle defined by the
$\varepsilon$-insensitivity zone in each dimension of the selected image
representation domain. Unfortunately, not every image representation domain is
well-suited for such a simple, scalar-wise, approach because statistical and/or
perceptual interactions between the coefficients may exist. These interactions
imply that scalar approaches may induce distortions that do not follow the
image statistics and/or are perceptually annoying. Taking into account these
relations would imply using non-rectangular $\varepsilon$-insensitivity regions
(allowing coupled distortions in different coefficients), which is beyond the
conventional SVM formulation.
  In this paper, we report a condition on the suitable domain for developing
efficient SVM image coding schemes. We analytically demonstrate that no linear
domain fulfills this condition because of the statistical and perceptual
inter-coefficient relations that exist in these domains. This theoretical
result is experimentally confirmed by comparing SVM learning in previously
reported linear domains and in a recently proposed non-linear perceptual domain
that simultaneously reduces the statistical and perceptual relations (so it is
closer to fulfilling the proposed condition). These results highlight the
relevance of an appropriate choice of the image representation before SVM
learning.

two-component quantum theory of atoms in molecules (TC-QTAIM) namely, the
theory of localization/delocalization of quantum particles, is disclosed. The
unified proposed scheme is able not only to deal with the
localization/delocalization of electrons in/between atomic basins, but also to
treat nuclei as well as exotic particles like positrons and muons equally.
Based on the general reduced second order density matrices for
indistinguishable quantum particles, the quantum fluctuations of atomic basins
are introduced and then used as a gauge to quantify the
localization/delocalization introducing proper indexes. The explicit
mass-dependence of the proposed indexes is demonstrated and it is shown that a
single localization/delocalization index is capable of being used for all kind
of quantum particles regardless of their masses or charge content. For various
non-Born-Oppenhiemer (non-BO) wavefunctions, including Hartree-product as well
as singlet and triplet determinants, the indices are calculated and then
employed to rationalize the localization/delocalization of particles in a
series of four-body model systems consist of two electrons and two positively
charged particles with variable mass. The ab initio FV-MC_MO derived non-BO
wavefunctions for the four-body series are used for a comprehensive
computational TC-QTAIM analysis, including topological analysis as well as
basin integrations, in a wide mass region, m=10me-10^13me (me stands for
electron mass), disclosing various traits in these series of species that are
unique to the TC-QTAIM. Finally, it is concluded that the proposed
localization/delocalization scheme is capable of quantifying quantum tunneling
of nuclei for systems containing delocalized protons.

during which high signal-to-noise spectra of the Moon were obtained. We exploit
those Echelle spectra to study the optical integrated solar spectrum . The
DAOSPEC program is used to measure solar line positions through gaussian
fitting in an automatic way. We first apply the LFC solar spectrum to
characterize the CCDs of the HARPS spectrograph. The comparison of the LFC and
Th-Ar calibrated spectra reveals S-type distortions on each order along the
whole spectral range with an amplitude of +/-40 m/s. This confirms the pattern
found by Wilken et al. (2010) on a single order and extends the detection of
the distortions to the whole analyzed region revealing that the precise shape
varies with wavelength. A new data reduction is implemented to deal with CCD
pixel inequalities to obtain a wavelength corrected solar spectrum. By using
this spectrum we provide a new LFC calibrated solar atlas with 400 line
positions in the range of 476-530, and 175 lines in the 534-585 nm range. The
new LFC atlas improves the accuracy of individual lines by a significant factor
reaching a mean value of about 10 m/s. The LFC--based solar line wavelengths
are essentially free of major instrumental effects and provide a reference for
absolute solar line positions. We suggest that future LFC observations could be
used to trace small radial velocity changes of the whole solar photospheric
spectrum in connection with the solar cycle and for direct comparison with the
predicted line positions of 3D radiative hydrodynamical models of the solar

on complex networks. Each individual is assigned a weight that is proportional
to the power of its degree, where the exponent alpha is an adjustable parameter
that controls the level of diversity among individuals in the network. During
the evolution, every individual chooses one of its neighbors as a reference
with a probability proportional to the weight of the neighbor, and updates its
strategy depending on their payoff difference. It is found that there exists an
optimal value of alpha, for which the level of cooperation reaches maximum.
This phenomenon indicates that, although high-degree individuals play a
prominent role in maintaining the cooperation, too strong influences from the
hubs may counterintuitively inhibit the diffusion of cooperation. We provide a
physical theory, aided by numerical computations, to explain the emergence of
the optimal cooperation. Other pertinent quantities such as the payoff, the
cooperator density as a function of the degree, and the payoff distribution,
are also investigated. Our results suggest that, in order to achieve strong
cooperation on a complex network, individuals should learn more frequently from

changes resulting from tether-cutting reconnection over about 30 minutes during

tether-cutting reconnection was first collected through multiwavelength
observations and then by the analysis of the field lines traced from positions
of four conspicuous flare 1700 A footpoints observed at the event onset. Right
before the flare, the four footpoints are located very close to the regions of
local maxima of magnetic twist index. Especially, the field lines from the
inner two footpoints form two strongly twisted flux bundles (up to ~1.2 turns),
which shear past each other and reach out close to the outer two footpoints,
respectively. Immediately after the flare, the twist index of regions around
the footpoints greatly diminish and the above field lines become low lying and
less twisted (~0.6 turns), overarched by loops linking the later formed two
flare ribbons. About 10% of the flux (~3x10^19 Mx) from the inner footpoints
has undergone a footpoint exchange. This portion of flux originates from the
edge regions of the inner footpoints that are brightened first. These rapid
changes of magnetic field connectivity inferred from the NLFFF extrapolation
are consistent with the tether-cutting magnetic reconnection model.

task is usually circumvented by coarse-graining the problem: one either
considers a Newtonian dynamics of ""particles"" with macroscopically large masses
or approximates the dark matter distribution with a continuous density field.
There is no closed system of equations for the evolution of the matter density
field alone and instead it should still be discretized at each timestep. In
this work we describe a method of solving the full 6-dimensional Vlasov-Poisson
equation via a system of auxiliary Schroedinger-like equations. The complexity
of the problem gets shifted into the choice of the number and shape of the
initial wavefunctions that should only be specified at the beginning of the
computation (we stress that these wavefunctions have nothing to do with quantum
nature of the actual dark matter particles). We discuss different prescriptions
to generate the initial wave functions from the initial conditions and
demonstrate the validity of the technique on two simple test cases. This new
simulation algorithm can in principle be used on an arbitrary distribution
function, enabling the simulation of warm and hot dark matter structure
formation scenarios.

the AP may be more appropriate if the earlier part of the ROC curve is of

evaluation of strong collision contributions by the semiclassical formalism.

dynamics of many organisms, including insects that are of concern for human
health and agriculture. This is particularly true for vector-borne infectious
diseases, like malaria, which is a major source of morbidity and mortality in
humans. Understanding the mechanistic links between environment and population
processes for these diseases is key to predicting the consequences of climate
change on transmission and for developing effective interventions. An important
measure of the intensity of disease transmission is the reproductive number
$R_0$. However, understanding the mechanisms linking $R_0$ and temperature, an
environmental factor driving disease risk, can be challenging because the data
available for parameterization are often poor. To address this we show how a
Bayesian approach can help identify critical uncertainties in components of
$R_0$ and how this uncertainty is propagated into the estimate of $R_0$. Most
notably, we find that different parameters dominate the uncertainty at
different temperature regimes: bite rate from 15-25$^\circ$ C; fecundity across
all temperatures, but especially $\sim$25-32$^\circ$ C; mortality from
20-30$^\circ$ C; parasite development rate at $\sim$15-16$^\circ$C and again at
$\sim$33-35$^\circ$C. Focusing empirical studies on these parameters and
corresponding temperature ranges would be the most efficient way to improve
estimates of $R_0$. While we focus on malaria, our methods apply to improving
process-based models more generally, including epidemiological, physiological
niche, and species distribution models.

if an asymptotically flat 3-manifold (M,g) of nonnegative scalar curvature
contains a non-compact, properly embedded minimal surface which is stable and
has quadratic area growth, then it is isometric to the flat R^{3}. This
implies, for instance, that in presence of a positive ADM mass any sequence of
solutions to the Plateau problem with diverging boundaries can never have
uniform height bounds, even at a single point. The proof of this theorem is
based on a characterization of finite index minimal surfaces, on classical
infinitesimal rigidity results by Fischer-Colbrie and Schoen and on the
positive mass theorem by Schoen-Yau. More specifically, we also show that a
complete minimal surface of finite index inside an asymptotically flat
3-manifold has finitely many ends and each of these is a graph of a function
that has a suitable expansion at infinity, in analogy with a classical result
by Schoen for Euclidean spaces. In addition, we prove that a non-compact stable
MOTS in an initial data set (M,g,k) is conformally diffeomorphic to either the
plane C or to the cylinder A and in the latter case infinitesimal rigidity
holds. If the data have harmonic asymptotics, the former case is also proven to
be globally rigid in the sense that the presence of a stable MOTS forces an
isometric embedding of (M,g,k) in the Minkowski space-time (\mathbb{M},\eta) as
a space-like slice.

IceCube experiment has detected some TeV-PeV neutrino events whose origin is
yet unknown. We study if all or a fraction of these events can be described by
the interactions of cosmic rays with matter.
  We consider the average target density needed to explain them for different
halo sizes and shapes, the effect of the chemical composition of the cosmic
rays, the impact of the directional information of the neutrino events, and the
constraints from gamma ray bounds and their direction. We do not require
knowledge of the cosmic ray escape time or injection for our approach. We find
that, given all constraints, at most 0.1 of the observed neutrino events in
Ice-Cube can be described by cosmic ray interactions with matter. In addition,
we demonstrate that the currently established chemical composition of the
cosmic rays contradicts a peak of the neutrino spectrum at PeV energies.

relies on applying a voltage across an insulating membrane to generate a high

nanopores fabricated by this method produce clear electrical signals from
translocating DNA molecules. Considering the tremendous reduction in complexity

constrain the parameter space of the model of Schmaltz, Stolarski and Thaler, a
Little Higgs model with two Higgs doublets, which we will refer to as the BLH
model. We account for all production and decay modes explored at ATLAS and CMS
in two scenarios: a general case, which assumes the $h_0$ state is light
($m_{h_0} \approx 125$ GeV) and the masses of the other neutral scalars ($H_0$
and $A_0$) are allowed to vary, and a case with a near-degeneracy between the
masses of the $h_0$ and $A_0$ and, for some choices of parameters, the $H_0$
states. The near-degeneracy scenario can result in an enhanced diphoton rate,
as measured by ATLAS, but is largely ruled out by a combination of the $h_0
\rightarrow \tau^+\tau^-$ and the heavy $H_0 \rightarrow W^+W^-$ measurements.
In the general case, we find large regions of parameter space that are in
better agreement with either the ATLAS or CMS results than is the SM. However,
a significantly enhanced diphoton rate is only possible through large
contributions to the $h_0 \gamma \gamma$ effective coupling from charged Higgs
bosons in a region of parameter space that borders on violation of
perturbativity in the scalar sector.

their spatial derivatives. Direct integration of this system is discussed to
finally demonstrate the inexpediency of such an approach when dealing with

formulation is deployed to invert for the physical parameters. Analysis of this
latter inversion procedure provides existence and uniqueness results while the
reconstruction stability with respect to the measurements is investigated. As
the inversion procedure requires differentiating the measurements twice, a
numerical differentiation scheme based on an ad hoc regularization then allows
an optimally stable reconstruction of the sought moduli. Numerical results are

Punishing unfair behavior is therefore common, and according to the theory of
strong reciprocity, it is also directly related to rewarding cooperative
behavior. However, empirical data fail to confirm that positive and negative
reciprocity are correlated. Inspired by this disagreement, we determine whether
the combined application of reward and punishment is evolutionary advantageous.
We study a spatial public goods game, where in addition to the three elementary
strategies of defection, rewarding and punishment, a fourth strategy combining
the later two competes for space. We find rich dynamical behavior that gives
rise to intricate phase diagrams where continuous and discontinuous phase
transitions occur in succession. Indirect territorial competition, spontaneous
emergence of cyclic dominance, as well as divergent fluctuations of
oscillations that terminate in an absorbing phase are observed. Yet despite the
high complexity of solutions, the combined strategy can survive only in very
narrow and unrealistic parameter regions. Elementary strategies, either in pure
or mixed phases, are much more common and likely to prevail. Our results
highlight the importance of patterns and structure in human cooperation, which
should be considered in future experiments.

estimate the reheat temperature, there are two important conditions one needs
to satisfy: (a) the decay products of the inflaton must dominate the energy
density of the universe, i.e. the universe becomes completely radiation
dominated, and (b) the decay products of the inflaton have attained local
thermodynamical equilibrium. For some choices of parameters, the latter is a
more stringent condition, such that the decay products may thermalise much
after the beginning of radiation-domination. Consequently, we have obtained
that the reheat temperature can be much lower than the standard-lore
estimation. In this paper we describe under what conditions our universe could
have efficient or inefficient thermalisation, and quantify the reheat

robust trends in our light curves. The $r'$ and $i'$ light curves appear to be
anticorrelated with $z'$ and $H$ for the T0.5 component and in the unresolved
lightcurve. In the defocused dataset, $J$ appears correlated with $z'$ and $H$
and anticorrelated with $r'$ and $i'$, while in the focused dataset we measure
no variability for $J$ at the level of our photometric precision, likely due to
evolving weather phenomena. In our focused T0.5 component lightcurve, the $K$
band lightcurve displays a significant phase offset relative to both $H$ and
$z'$. We argue that the measured phase offsets are correlated with atmospheric
pressure probed at each band, as estimated from 1D atmospheric models. We also

stellar age, but age can be difficult to determine so a proxy like the

used. Here we report an unexpected behavior found in the velocity dispersion of
a sample of giant stars from the RAdial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) survey with
high quality chemical and kinematical information, in that it decreases
strongly for stars with [Mg/Fe] > 0.4 dex (i.e., those that formed in the first
Gyr of the Galaxy's life). These findings can be explained by perturbations
from massive mergers in the early Universe, which have affected more strongly
the outer parts of the disc, and the subsequent radial migration of stars with
cooler kinematics from the inner disc. Similar reversed trends in velocity
dispersion are also found for different metallicity subpopulations. Our results
suggest that the Milky Way disc merger history can be recovered by relating the
observed chemo-kinematic relations to the properties of past merger events.

one or more wave vectors k=(1/2 1/2 1/2). Starting from a general microscopic

standard mean-field theory (s-MFT) an extended range of interaction parameters

ignored in s-MFT are responsible for the selection of one particular partially
ordered phase, e.g. the ""4-k"" phase over the ""1-k"" phase. We suggest that the
transition into the 4-k phase is continuous with its critical properties
controlled by the cubic fixed point of a Ginzburg-Landau theory with a
4-component vector order-parameter. By combining an extension of the
Thouless-Anderson-Palmer method originally used to study fluctuations in spin

potentially coherent signals in the neutron star rest frame by first removing
the phase delays associated with the star's binary motion and computing FFT
power spectra of continuous light curves with up to $2^{30}$ time bins. We
search a range of frequencies in which both r- and g-modes are theoretically
expected to reside. Using data from the discovery outburst of the 435 Hz pulsar
XTE J1751$-$305 we find a single candidate, coherent oscillation with a
frequency of $0.5727597 \times \nu_{spin} = 249.332609$ Hz, and a fractional
Fourier amplitude of $7.46 \times 10^{-4}$. We estimate the significance of
this feature at the $1.6 \times 10^{-3}$ level, slightly better than a
$3\sigma$ detection. We argue that possible mode identifications include
rotationally-modified g-modes associated with either a helium-rich surface
layer or a density discontinuity due to electron captures on hydrogen in the
accreted ocean. Alternatively, the frequency could be identified with that of
an inertial mode or an r-mode modified by the presence of a solid crust,
however, the r-mode amplitude required to account for the observed modulation
amplitude would induce a large spin-down rate inconsistent with the observed

coupling between the scalar field and the matter fields and yet mimics general
relativity in the Solar System. The scalar degree of freedom is hidden in
high-density environments because the effective mass of the chameleon scalar
depends on the trace of the stress-energy tensor. In the early Universe, when
the trace of the matter stress-energy tensor is nearly zero, the chameleon is
very light, and Hubble friction prevents it from reaching the minimum of its
effective potential. Whenever a particle species becomes non-relativistic,
however, the trace of the stress-energy tensor is temporarily nonzero, and the
chameleon begins to roll. We show that these ""kicks"" to the chameleon field
have catastrophic consequences for chameleon gravity. The velocity imparted to
the chameleon by the kick is sufficiently large that the chameleon's mass
changes rapidly as it slides past its potential minimum. This nonadiabatic
evolution shatters the chameleon field by generating extremely high-energy
perturbations through quantum particle production. If the chameleon's coupling
to matter is slightly stronger than gravitational, the excited modes have
trans-Planckian momenta. The production of modes with momenta exceeding 1e7 GeV
can only be avoided for small couplings and finely tuned initial conditions.
These quantum effects also significantly alter the background evolution of the
chameleon field, and we develop new analytic and numerical techniques to treat
quantum particle production in the regime of strong dissipation. This analysis
demonstrates that chameleon gravity cannot be treated as a classical field
theory at the time of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and casts doubt on chameleon
gravity's viability as an alternative to general relativity.

galaxies is the cause of a positive correlation between star formation rate
(SFR) and gas-phase metallicity (Zg) at high stellar mass (M*) in the local
Universe. To do this, two classes of massive (M* >= 10^10.5 Msun) galaxy are
selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Munich semi-analytic
model of galaxy formation, L-Galaxies. The first class is selected by high
specific star formation rates (sSFR) and high Zg, and the second class by low
sSFR and low Zg. These criteria roughly distinguish disc-dominant galaxies from
metal-poor, elliptical galaxies. In the semi-analytic model, the second class
of galaxies obtain low sSFR and low Zg due to gradual dilution of the
interstellar medium by accretion of metal-poor gas via infalling clumps and
low-mass satellites. This occurs after a merger-induced starburst and the
associated supernova feedback have quenched most of the original gas reservoir.
A number of signatures of this evolution are present in these model galaxies at
z=0, including low gas fractions, large central black holes, elliptical
morphologies, old ages, and importantly, low (Zg-Z*) indicating dilution after
star formation. Remarkably, all of these properties are also found in low-sSFR,
low-Zg, massive galaxies in the SDSS-DR7. This provides strong, indirect
evidence that some elliptical galaxies are undergoing gradual dilution after a
gas-rich merger in the local Universe. This dilution scenario also explains the
positive correlation between SFR and Zg measured in high-M* galaxies, and
therefore has consequences for the local fundamental metallicity relation
(FMR), which assumes a weak anti-correlation between SFR and Zg above 10^10.5
Msun.

Gaussian until saturation. This establishes a lower bound for the fidelity
decay in realistic systems. An ultimate bound for systems with many-body

and dynamic gene expression programs is encoded in the genome. The interactions
of transcription factors (TFs) with DNA regulatory elements clearly play an
important role in determining gene expression outputs, yet the regulatory logic
underlying functional transcription factor binding is poorly understood. Many
studies have focused on characterizing the genomic locations of TF binding, yet
it is unclear to what extent TF binding at any specific locus has functional
consequences with respect to gene expression output. To evaluate the context of
functional TF binding we knocked down 59 TFs and chromatin modifiers in one
HapMap lymphoblastoid cell line. We then identified genes whose expression was
affected by the knockdowns. We intersected the gene expression data with
transcription factor binding data (based on ChIP-seq and DNase-seq) within 10
kb of the transcription start sites of expressed genes. This combination of
data allowed us to infer functional TF binding. On average, 14.7% of genes
bound by a factor were differentially expressed following the knockdown of that
factor, suggesting that most interactions between TF and chromatin do not
result in measurable changes in gene expression levels of putative target
genes. We found that functional TF binding is enriched in regulatory elements
that harbor a large number of TF binding sites, at sites with predicted higher
binding affinity, and at sites that are enriched in genomic regions annotated

everywhere and at all epochs point in the same direction is the `past
hypothesis': the Universe had a very special low-entropy initial state. We
present the first evidence for an alternative conjecture: the arrows exist in
all solutions of the gravitational law that governs the Universe and arise
because the space of its true degrees of freedom (shape space) is asymmetric.
We prove our conjecture for arrows of complexity and information in the
Newtonian N-body problem. Except for a set of measure zero, all of its
solutions for non-negative energy divide at a uniquely defined point into two
halves. In each a well-defined measure of complexity fluctuates but grows
irreversibly between rising bounds from that point. Structures that store
dynamical information are created as the complexity grows. Recognition of the
division is a key novelty of our approach. Each solution can be viewed as
having a single past and two distinct futures emerging from it. Any internal
observer must be in one half of the solution and will only be aware of one past
and one future. The `paradox' of a time-symmetric law that leads to
observationally irreversible behaviour is fully resolved. General Relativity
shares enough architectonic structure with the N-body problem for us to prove
the existence of analogous complexity arrows in the vacuum Bianchi IX model. In
the absence of non-trivial solutions with matter we cannot prove that arrows of
dynamical information will arise in GR, though they have in our Universe.
Finally, we indicate how the other arrows of time could arise.

universal has recently been challenged by a number of observations. Several
studies have shown that a ""heavy"" IMF (e.g., with a Salpeter-like abundance of
low mass stars and thus normalisation) is preferred for massive early-type
galaxies, while this IMF is inconsistent with the properties of less massive,
later-type galaxies. These discoveries motivate the hypothesis that the IMF may
vary (possibly very slightly) across galaxies and across components of
individual galaxies (e.g. bulges vs discs). In this paper we use a sample of 19
late-type strong gravitational lenses from the SWELLS survey to investigate the
IMFs of the bulges and discs in late-type galaxies. We perform a joint analysis
of the galaxies' total masses (constrained by strong gravitational lensing) and
stellar masses (constrained by optical and near-infrared colours in the context
of a stellar population synthesis [SPS] model, up to an IMF normalisation
parameter). Using minimal assumptions apart from the physical constraint that
the total stellar mass within any aperture must be less than the total mass
within the aperture, we find that the bulges of the galaxies cannot have IMFs
heavier (i.e. implying high mass per unit luminosity) than Salpeter, while the
disc IMFs are not well constrained by this data set. We also discuss the
necessity for hierarchical modelling when combining incomplete information
about multiple astronomical objects. This modelling approach allows us to place
upper limits on the size of any departures from universality. More data,
including spatially resolved kinematics (as in paper V) and stellar population
diagnostics over a range of bulge and disc masses, are needed to robustly
quantify how the IMF varies within galaxies.

specific heat and isothermal compressibility for a uniform Bose gas is found to
have signature of the incipient Bose-Einstein condensation in very weak
coupling regime although the system does not really go in the Bose-condensed
phase. The transition temperature in harmonically trapped case decreases with
increase of coupling strength consistent with the weakening of the statistical
attractive interaction. Anomalous behavior of some thermodynamic quantities,
partly akin to that in dimensions less than two, appears for uniform fermions
as soon as the Fermi level goes down the Dirac point on increasing the coupling
strength. It is suggested that the fluctuation-dissipation theorem can be

Our methodological contribution focuses primarily on GPU computation, as this

However, in our empirical work we study the relative merits of all three
paradigms to determine how best to combine them. The paper concludes with two
case studies. One is a real data fluid-dynamics computer experiment which
benefits from the local nature of our approximation; the second is a synthetic

  P., Eds; Proceedings of ADASS XXIII",,,,"astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present the Cone of Darkness, an application to automatically configure
blank-sky positions for a series of stacked, wide-field observations, such as
those carried out by the SAMI instrument on the Anglo-Australian Telescope
(AAT). The Sydney-AAO Multi-object Integral field spectrograph (SAMI) uses a
plug-plate to mount its $13 \times 61$ core imaging fibre bundles (hexabundles)
in the optical plane at the telescope's prime focus. To make the most efficient
use of each plug-plate, several observing fields are typically stacked to
produce a single plate. When choosing blank-sky positions for the observations
it is most effective to select these such that one set of 26 holes gives valid
sky positions for all fields on the plate. However, when carried out manually
this selection process is tedious and includes a significant risk of error. The
Cone of Darkness software aims to provide uniform blank-sky position coverage
over the field of observation, within the limits set by the distribution of
target positions and the chosen input catalogues. This will then facilitate the
production of the best representative median sky spectrum for use in sky
subtraction. The application, written in C++, is configurable, making it usable
for a range of instruments. Given the plate characteristics and the positions
of target holes, the software segments the unallocated space on the plate and
determines the position which best fits the uniform distribution requirement.
This position is checked, for each field, against the selected catalogue using
a TAP ADQL search. The process is then repeated until the desired number of sky
positions is attained.

players update their strategy in order to maximize their payoff. The main
objective of this paper is to study a stochastic spatial version of this game
based on the framework of interacting particle systems in which players are
located on an infinite square lattice. In the presence of two strategies, and
calling a strategy selfish or altruistic depending on a certain ordering of the
coefficients of the underlying payoff matrix, a simple analysis of the
non-spatial mean-field approximation of the spatial model shows that a strategy
is evolutionary stable if and only if it is selfish, making the system bistable
when both strategies are selfish. The spatial and non-spatial models agree when
at least one strategy is altruistic. In contrast, we prove that, in the
presence of two selfish strategies and in any spatial dimensions, only the most
selfish strategy remains evolutionary stable. The main ingredients of the proof
are monotonicity results and a coupling between the best-response dynamics
properly rescaled in space with bootstrap percolation to compare the infinite
time limits of both systems.

dissimilarity $d_{nav}$ counts the steps along a ""combing"" of the Nearest
Neighbor Interchange (NNI) graph of binary hierarchies, providing an efficient
approximation to the (NP-hard) NNI distance in terms of ""edit length"". At the
same time, a closed form formula for $d_{nav}$ presents it as a weighted count
of pairwise incompatibilities between clusters, lending it the character of an
edge dissimilarity measure as well. A relaxation of this formula to a simple
count yields another measure on all trees --- the crossing dissimilarity
$d_{CM}$. Both dissimilarities are symmetric and positive definite (vanish only
between identical trees) on binary hierarchies but they fail to satisfy the
triangle inequality. Nevertheless, both are bounded below by the widely used
Robinson-Foulds metric and bounded above by a closely related true metric, the
cluster-cardinality metric $d_{CC}$. We show that each of the three proposed
new dissimilarities is computable in time $O(n^2)$ in the number of leaves $n$,
and conclude the paper with a brief numerical exploration of the distribution
over tree space of these dissimilarities in comparison with the Robinson-Foulds
metric and the more recently introduced matching-split distance.

the scattering lengths of Nambu-Goldstone bosons off $D$ mesons. It is shown
that the LQCD data can be better described in this formalism than in the widely
used on-shell approximation. On the other hand, no qualitative difference
between the on-shell and off-shell approaches is observed for the light-quark
mass evolution of the scattering lengths, given the limited LQCD data and their
relatively large uncertainties. We also show that the light-quark mass
dependence of the $D^*_{s0}(2317)$ remains essentially the same in both
approaches.

depend upon factors that differ between males and females. Understanding the
conditions for invasion in a two-locus model can elucidate these processes. For
instance, selection can act differently upon the sexes, or sex-linkage can
facilitate the invasion of genetic variation with opposing fitness effects
between the sexes. Two factors that deserve further attention are recombination
rates and allele frequencies -- both of which can vary substantially between
the sexes. We find that sex-specific recombination rates in a two-locus diploid
model can affect the invasion outcome of sexually antagonistic alleles and that
the sex-averaged recombination rate is not necessarily sufficient to predict
invasion. We confirm that the range of permissible recombination rates is
smaller in the sex benefitting from invasion and larger in the sex harmed by
invasion. However, within the invasion space, male recombination rate can be
greater than, equal to, or less than female recombination rate in order for a
male-benefit, female-detriment allele to invade (and similarly for a
female-benefit, male-detriment allele). We further show that a novel, sexually
antagonistic allele that is also associated with a lowered recombination rate
can invade more easily when present in the double heterozygote genotype.
Finally, we find that sexual dimorphism in resident allele frequencies can
impact the invasion of new sexually antagonistic alleles at a second locus. Our
results suggest that accounting for sex-specific recombination rates and allele
frequencies can determine the difference between invasion and non-invasion of
novel sexually antagonistic alleles in a two-locus model.

Standard Model and to test the limits of this theory. To obtain a higher
precision for top quark predictions, the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO)
in the pertubative expansion of the top quark production cross-section has to
be calculated. The next-to-leading order (NLO) results are already available
and provide a rather good accuracy. But this precision might be accidental,
because at NLO not all the possible colour exchanges which occur at the
one-loop level are considered and they could have significant impact on the
cross-section and its differential distributions. In order to have precise
predictions of the single top quark production the complete NNLO calculation is
necessary. In this thesis the contributions of the one-loop amplitudes squared
in NNLO are calculated for one production channel ($\textit{t}$-channel). The
other possible production channels of the single top quark are also
investigated. With the presented setup well known results in literature are
reproduced. Intermediate results are calculated with different independent
methods and, if possible, compared with results from literature. The occurring
ultraviolet divergencies are dealt with in conventional dimensional
regularisation (CDR) in the $\bar{\text{MS}}$ scheme (""Modified Minimal

anti-commuting scheme for the calculation with the $\gamma_5$ matrix in CDR is
used. An alternative scheme for the treatment of $\gamma_5$ is the Larin
scheme, which will be introduced and discussed.

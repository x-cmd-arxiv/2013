stock market returns and corresponding trading volumes using high- frequency
data from the Polish stock market. First, for stocks that were traded for
suffciently long period of time, we study the return and volume distributions
and identify their consistency with the power-law functions. We find that, for
majority of stocks, the scaling exponents of both distri- butions are
systematically related by about a factor of 2 with the ones for the returns
being larger. Second, we study the empirical price impact of trades of a given
volume and find that this impact can be well described by a square-root
dependence: r(V) V^(1/2). We conclude that the prop- erties of data from the
Polish market resemble those reported in literature concerning certain mature
markets.

typically have fewer short links and more long links which can bridge together
otherwise isolated subnetworks. This network feature is known to improve
overall connectivity in 2D random networks operating at low channel path loss.
To this end, we advance recently established results to obtain analytic
expressions for the mean degree of 3D networks for simple but practical
anisotropic gain profiles, including those of patch, dipole and end-fire array
antennas. Our analysis reveals that for homogeneous systems (i.e. neglecting
boundary effects) directional radiation patterns are superior to the isotropic
case only when the path loss exponent is less than the spatial dimension.
Moreover, we establish that ad hoc networks utilizing directional transmit and
isotropic receive antennas (or vice versa) are always sub-optimally connected
regardless of the environment path loss. We extend our analysis to investigate
boundary effects in inhomogeneous systems, and study the geometrical reasons
why directional radiating nodes are at a disadvantage to isotropic ones.
Finally, we discuss multi-directional gain patterns consisting of many equally
spaced lobes which could be used to mitigate boundary effects and improve
overall network connectivity.

foliation \Omega_u of X transverse to \psi so that after reparametrizing the
flow \psi^u_s maps leaves of \Omega_u to leaves via a local

  Among other things, we additionally prove that \C_X is equal to (the cone
over) the component of the BNS-invariant containing u_0 and that each primitive
integral u\in\C_X induces a splitting of G as an ascending HNN-extension over a
finite-rank free group along an injective endomorphism \phi_u. For any such
splitting, we show that the stretch factor of \phi_u is exactly given by

non-Gaussianity of the primordial density field, complementary to existing
constraints from the cosmic microwave background. In particular, the scale
dependence of halo bias, which affects the halo distribution at large scales,
represents a promising tool for analyzing primordial non-Gaussianity of local
form. Future observations, for example, may be able to constrain the
trispectrum parameter gNL that is difficult to study and constrain using the
CMB alone. We investigate how galaxy and matter bispectra can distinguish
between the two non-Gaussian parameters fNL and gNL, whose effects give nearly
degenerate contributions to the power spectra. We use a generalization of the
univariate bias approach, making the hypothesis that the number density of
halos forming at a given position is a function of the local matter density
contrast and of its local higher-order statistics. Using this approach, we
calculate the halo-matter bispectra and analyze their properties. We determine
a connection between the sign of the halo bispectrum on large scales and the
parameter gNL. We also construct a combination of halo and matter bispectra
that is sensitive to fNL, with little contamination from gNL. We study both the
case of single and multiple sources to the primordial gravitational potential,
discussing how to extend the concept of stochastic halo bias to the case of
bispectra. We use a specific halo mass-function to calculate numerically the
bispectra in appropriate squeezed limits, confirming our theoretical findings.

turbulence may affect neutrino flavor conversion probabilities. Such effects
have been usually studied by adding parametrized small-scale random
fluctuations (with arbitrary amplitude) on top of coarse, spherically symmetric
matter density profiles. Recently, however, two-dimensional (2D) SN models have
reached a space resolution high enough to directly trace anisotropic density
profiles, down to scales smaller than the typical neutrino oscillation length.
In this context, we analyze the statistical properties of a large set of SN
matter density profiles obtained in a high-resolution 2D simulation, focusing
on a post-bounce time (2 s) suited to study shock-wave effects on neutrino
propagation on scales as small as O(100) km and possibly below. We clearly find
the imprint of a broken (Kolmogorov-Kraichnan) power-law structure, as
generically expected in 2D turbulence spectra. We then compute the flavor
evolution of SN neutrinos along representative realizations of the turbulent
matter density profiles, and observe no or modest damping of the neutrino
crossing probabilities on their way through the shock wave. In order to check
the effect of possibly unresolved fluctuations at scales below O(100) km, we
also apply a randomization procedure anchored to the power spectrum calculated
from the simulation, and find consistent results within \pm 1 sigma
fluctuations. These results show the importance of anchoring turbulence effects

Normally these two processes suppress each other, with the glass transition

true for systems of colloidal hard spheres, which are commonly used as building
blocks for novel functional materials with potential applications, e.g.
photonic crystals. By performing Brownian dynamics simulations of glassy

the crystallization of such hard-sphere glasses can be dramatically promoted by
doping the system with small amounts of active particles. Surprisingly, even
hard-sphere glasses of packing fraction up to $\phi = 0.635$ crystallize, which
is around $0.5\%$ below the random close packing at $\phi \simeq 0.64$. Our

two band passes show bright fronts that are co-spatial when observed at the
same time, therefore I believe that the same wave is observed in different band
passes. The wave front is not observable in Halpha, but just in Fexii and in
soft X-ray, indicating that the temperature of the wave front is slightly
higher than the chromospheric temperature. The ratio of emission through two
SXI filters gives a temperature of 7 10^6 K for the wave front. The
northern-most edge of the CME footprint related to this wave corresponds to the
last location of the wave on the limb. The image processing reveals stationary
brightenings produced on the passage of the wave front. The potential spherical
extrapolation of the sun shows that those stationary brightenings are lying in
jumps of magnetic field lines connectivity.

derive the GLF applying a statistical subtraction of the background in three
regions: a circle of 0.29 deg radius (1.5 Mpc) encompassing the whole cluster,
and two circles centered on each of the two brightest galaxies (BCG2,
northeast, coinciding with the peak of X-ray emission, and BCG1, southwest) of
radii 0.15 deg (0.775 Mpc). We also compute the GLF in the zone around BCG1,
which is covered by the WINGS survey in the B and V bands, by selecting cluster
members in the red sequence in a (B-V) versus V diagram. Finally, we discuss
the dynamical characteristics of the cluster implied by a Serna & Gerbal
analysis. The GLFs are not well fit by a single Schechter function, but
satisfactory fits are obtained by summing a Gaussian and a Schechter function.
The GLF computed by selecting galaxies in the red sequence in the region
surrounding BCG1 can also be fit by a Gaussian plus a Schechter function. An
excess of galaxies in the brightest bins is detected in the BCG1 and BCG2
regions. The dynamical analysis based on the Serna & Gerbal method shows the
existence of a main structure of 82 galaxies which can be subdivided into two
main substructures of 25 and 6 galaxies. A smaller structure of 6 galaxies is
also detected. The B band GLFs of Abell 3376 are clearly perturbed, as already
found in other merging clusters. The dynamical properties are consistent with
the existence of several substructures, in agreement with a previously
published X-ray analysis.

Both fully implicit and energy-splitting time-stepping schemes are proposed.
The primary goal of the paper is to derive sharp error bounds which depend on
the reciprocal of the perturbation parameter $\epsilon$ (also called
""interaction length"") only in some lower polynomial order, instead of
exponential order, for the proposed IP-DG methods. The derivation is based on a

result in totally discontinuous DG finite element spaces with a help of a
similar spectrum estimate result in the conforming finite element spaces which
was established in [12]. As a nontrivial application of the sharp error
estimates, they are used to establish convergence and the rates of convergence
of the zero level sets of the fully discrete IP-DG solutions to the classical

presented to gauge the theoretical results and the performance of the proposed

sputtered Ni80Fe20 (""Permalloy"") thin films of varied thicknesses, where we
determine the bulk g-factor value to be 2.109 +/- 0.003. Such an approach is
further validated by application to simulated data that includes both noise and

additional mechanisms that may induce deviations from the Kittel equation.

parameters. Additionally, lensing peak counts contain cosmological information
beyond the power spectrum. Both of these statistics can be affected by the
preferential selection of source galaxies in patches of the sky with high
magnification, as well as by the dilution in the source galaxy surface density
in such regions. If not accounted for, these biases introduce systematic errors
for cosmological measurements. Here we quantify these systematic errors, using
convergence maps from a suite of ray-tracing N-body simulations. At the cut-off
magnitude m of on-going and planned major weak lensing surveys, the logarithmic
slope of the cumulative number counts s = dlog[n(>m)]/dlog(m) is in the range
0.1 < s < 0.5. At s = 0.2, expected in the I band for LSST, the inferred values
of Omega_m, w and sigma_8 are biased by many sigma (where sigma denotes the
marginalized error) and therefore the biases will need to be carefully modeled.
We also find that the parameters are biased differently in the (Omega_m, w,
sigma_8) parameter space when the power spectrum and when the peak counts are
used. In particular, w derived from the power spectrum is less affected than w
derived from peak counts, while the opposite is true for the best-constrained
combination of [sigma_8 Omega_m^gamma] (with gamma=0.62 from the power spectrum

The nuclear ""openness"" manifests itself through the presence of the many-body

radioactive nuclear beam experimentation extends the known nuclear landscape
towards the particle drip lines, the coupling to the continuum space becomes
exceedingly more important. Of particular interest are weakly bound and unbound
nuclear states appearing around particle thresholds. Theories of such nuclei
must take into account their open quantum nature. To describe open quantum
systems, we introduce a Complex Scaling (CS) approach in the Slater basis. We
benchmark it with the complex-energy Gamow Shell Model (GSM) by studying
energies and wave functions of the bound and unbound states of the two-neutron
halo nucleus 6He viewed as an $\alpha$+ n + n cluster system. In the CS
approach, we use the Slater basis, which exhibits the correct asymptotic
behavior at large distances. To extract particle densities from the
back-rotated CS solutions, we apply the Tikhonov regularization procedure,
which minimizes the ultraviolet numerical noise. While standard applications of
the inverse complex transformation to the complex-rotated solution provide
unstable results, the stabilization method fully reproduces the GSM benchmark.
We also propose a method to determine the smoothing parameter of the Tikhonov
regularization. The combined suite of CS-Slater and GSM techniques has many
attractive features when applied to nuclear problems involving weakly-bound and
unbound states. While both methods can describe energies, total widths, and
wave functions of nuclear states, the CS-Slater method, if it can be applied,
can provide an additional information about partial energy widths associated

migration, which is important for processes such as urbanization and the spread
of ideas. We demonstrate that the data record from Korean family books (called
""jokbo"") can be used to estimate migration patterns via marriages from the past
750 years. We apply two generative models of long-term human mobility to
quantify the relevance of geographical information to human marriage records in
the data, and we find that the wide variety in the geographical distributions
of the clans poses interesting challenges for the direct application of these
models. Using the different geographical distributions of clans, we quantify
the ""ergodicity"" of clans in terms of how widely and uniformly they have spread

construct and examine a population-flow network between regions. Based on the

characterizing separative magnetization transport (SMT). It is shown that the

spatially inhomogeneous. Third, the high spin-temperature (linear) limit is
shown to be equivalent to the model of nuclear spin transport of Genack and

The main result states that the logarithm of such series is integrable (to any

concerning the range of random Taylor series in the unit disk. In addition, we
prove a law of large numbers for the number of zeros of entire functions given

when a chiral Fermi surface is coupled with a soft collective mode in two space
dimensions. The full Fermi surface is described by a direct sum of chiral patch
theories, which are decoupled from each other in the low energy limit. Each
patch includes low energy excitations near a set of points on the Fermi surface
with a common tangent vector. General patch theories are classified by the
local shape of the Fermi surface, the dispersion of the critical boson, and the
symmetry group, which form the data for distinct universality classes. We prove
that a large class of chiral non-Fermi liquid states exist as stable critical
states of matter. For this, we use a renormalization group scheme where low
energy excitations of the Fermi surface are interpreted as a collection of
(1+1)-dimensional chiral fermions with a continuous flavor labelling the
momentum along the Fermi surface. Due to chirality, the Wilsonian effective
action is strictly UV finite. This allows one to extract the exact scaling
exponents although the theories flow to strongly interacting field theories at
low energies. In general, the low energy effective theory of the full Fermi
surface includes patch theories of more than one universality classes. As a
result, physical responses include multiple universal components at low
temperatures. We also point out that, in quantum field theories with extended
Fermi surface, a non-commutative structure naturally emerges between a
coordinate and a momentum which are orthogonal to each other. We show that the
invalidity of patch description for Fermi liquid states is tied with the
presence of UV/IR mixing associated with the emergent non-commutativity. On the
other hand, UV/IR mixing is suppressed in non-Fermi liquid states due to UV
insensitivity, and the patch description is valid.

analyzed; the different statistical maps are characterized within the
stochastic limit, reached after a large number of iterations of the billiard
maps. New densities of invariant measures have been established, also for
billiard systems which contain symmetry walls, according to the content of Weyl
reflections in the maps, which account for the change of sign of the
non-oscillating scale factors in the solution to the Einstein field equations.
The statistical equivalence between the big billiard and the small billiard,
posed in [Phys. Rev. D83, 044038 (2011)], is here proven by means of these new
definitions of probabilities for the small billiard. Further new classes of BKL
probabilities have also been defined especially for the one-variable map and
for the two-variable map, for the early-time BKL dynamics, for a stochastizing
BKL dynamics and for a completely stochastized dynamics, both for the big
billiard and for the small billiard. The trajectories have been classified
according to these new probabilties, and different specifications of
probabilties comparing classes of initial conditions have been assigned for the
stochastization of the dynamics. As a result, is is possible to establish a
definition of BKL probabilities for the unquotiented dynamics of the big
billiard, where the different patterns of Weyl reflections are encoded. The
statistical description of BKL probabilities for the occurrence of a given
number of epochs in each era are therefore further characterized by the most
probable number of Weyl reflections contained in such eras, which is inferred
from the implications of the billiard maps on the UPHP. These new constructions
have been considered for the determination of the connection between the
observed values of anisotropy by a stochastic limit of the BKL dynamics.

simplified kernel consisting of a momentum-space delta-function with a vector
Lorentz structure, to which one adds a mixed scalar and vector confining

invariant by itself, but decouples from the equations in the chiral limit and
therefore allows the NJL mechanism to work. With this model we calculate the

lattice constant of the graphene sheets, a common approximation is the two-band
model\cite{McCann2006} (2BM)\ where the eigenstates for the bilayer and
trilayer systems are described by a two-component spinor that gives the
amplitude of the wave function on the two sites with low-energy $\left\vert
E\right\vert <<\gamma_{1}$ where $% \gamma_{1}$ is the hopping energy between
sites that are directly above one another in adjacent layers. The 2BM has been
used extensively to study the phase diagram of the C2DEG in a magnetic field as
well as its transport and optical properties. In this paper, we use a numerical
approach to compute the eigenstates and Landau level energies of the full
tight-binding model in the continuum approximation and compare them with the
prediction of the 2BM when the magnetic field or an electrical bias between the
outermost layers is varied. Our numerical analysis shows that the 2BM is a good
approximation for bilayer graphene in a wide range of magnetic field and bias
but mostly for Landau level $M=0.$ The applicability of the 2BM in trilayer
graphene, even for level $M=0,$ is much more restricted. In this case, the 2BM\
fails to reproduce some of the level crossings that occur between the
sub-levels of $M=0.$

full quantum theory of gravity. In many cases, the covariant entropy counts
this entropy--the degeneracy of emergent quantum field theories in full quantum
gravity--with the entropy of particle excitations in each quantum field theory
giving only a tiny perturbation. In the Rindler description of a (black hole)
horizon, the relevant vacuum degrees of freedom manifest themselves as an extra
hidden quantum number carried by the states representing the second exterior
region; this quantum number is invisible in the emergent quantum field theory.
In a distant picture, these states arise as exponentially degenerate ground and
excited states of the intrinsically quantum gravitational degrees of freedom on
the stretched horizon. The formation and evaporation of a black hole involve
processes in which the entropy of collapsing matter is transformed into that of
a vacuum and then to that of final-state Hawking radiation. In the intermediate
stage of this evolution, entanglement between the vacuum and (early) Hawking
radiation develops, which is transferred to the entanglement among final-state
Hawking quanta through the evaporation process. The horizon is kept smooth
throughout the evolution; in particular, no firewall develops. Similar
considerations also apply for cosmological horizons, for example for the
horizon of a meta-stable de-Sitter space.

mass provide important constraints on both cosmology and models of galaxy
formation. Even though the dissipation and feedback processes associated with
galaxy formation are thought to affect the distribution of matter, essentially
all models used to predict clustering data are based on collisionless
simulations. Here, we use large hydrodynamical simulations to investigate how
galaxy formation affects the autocorrelation functions of galaxies and
subhaloes, as well as their cross-correlation with matter. We show that the
changes due to the inclusion of baryons are not limited to small scales and are
even present in samples selected by subhalo mass. Samples selected by subhalo
mass cluster ~10% more strongly in a baryonic run on scales r > 1Mpc/h, and
this difference increases for smaller separations. While the inclusion of
baryons boosts the clustering at fixed subhalo mass on all scales, the sign of
the effect on the cross-correlation of subhaloes with matter can vary with
radius. We show that the large-scale effects are due to the change in subhalo
mass caused by the strong feedback associated with galaxy formation and may
therefore not affect samples selected by number density. However, on scales r <
r_vir significant differences remain after accounting for the change in subhalo
mass. We conclude that predictions for galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-mass clustering
from models based on collisionless simulations will have errors greater than
10% on sub-Mpc scales, unless the simulation results are modified to correctly

radiation pressure) and optically thick regime, and adopt a moment-based
RT-method implemented in the moving-mesh code AREPO. The source luminosity, gas
density profile and initial temperature are varied. At typical temperatures and
densities of molecular clouds, radiation pressure drives velocities of order
~20 km/s over 1-5 Myr; enough to unbind the smaller clouds. However, these
estimates ignore the effects of photoionization that naturally occur
concurrently. When radiation pressure and photoionization act together, the
latter is substantially more efficient, inducing velocities comparable to the
sound speed of the hot ionized medium (10-15 km/s) on timescales far shorter
than required for accumulating similar momentum with radiation pressure. This
mismatch allows photoionization to dominate the feedback as the heating and
expansion of gas lowers the central densities, further diminishing the impact
of radiation pressure. Our results indicate that a proper treatment of the
impact of young stars on the interstellar medium needs to primarily account for
their ionization power whereas direct radiation pressure appears to be a
secondary effect. This conclusion may change if extreme boosts of the radiation
pressure by photon trapping are assumed.

large voids. We find that sources behind large ($\sim$$90\,\rm Mpc$) and deep
voids (density contrast about $-0.9$) can be magnified or demagnified with
magnitude fluctuations of up to $\sim$$0.05\,\rm mag$ and that the weak-lensing
shear can be up to the $\sim$$10^{-2}$ level in the outer regions of large
voids. Smaller or shallower voids produce proportionally smaller effects. We
investigate the ""wiggling"" of the primary cosmic microwave background (CMB)
temperature anisotropies caused by intervening cosmic voids. The void-wiggling
of primary CMB temperature gradients is of the opposite sign to that caused by
galaxy clusters. Only extremely large and deep voids can produce wiggling
amplitudes similar to galaxy clusters, $\sim$$\rm 15\,\mu K$ by a large void of
radius $\sim$$4^\circ$ and central density contrast $-0.9$ at redshift 0.5
assuming a CMB background gradient of $\sim$$\rm10\,\mu K\, arcmin^{-1}$. The
dipole signal is spread over the entire void area, and not concentrated at the
lens' center as it is for clusters. Finally we use our model to simulate CMB
sky maps lensed by large cosmic voids. Our embedded theory can easily be
applied to more complicated void models and used to study gravitational lensing
of the CMB, to probe dark-matter profiles, to reduce the lensing-induced
systematics in supernova Hubble diagrams, as well as study the integrated
Sachs-Wolfe effect.

impact of momentum-driven AGN feedback in cool-core clusters, focusing in this
paper on the formation of cold clumps. The feedback is jet-driven with an
energy determined by the amount of cold gas within 500 pc of the SMBH. When the
intra-cluster medium (ICM) in the core of the cluster becomes marginally stable
to radiative cooling, with the thermal instability to the free-fall timescale
ratio t_{TI}/t_{ff} < 3-10, cold clumps of gas start to form along the
propagation direction of the AGN jets. By tracing the particles in the
simulations, we find that these cold clumps originate from low entropy (but
still hot) gas that is accelerated by the jet to outward radial velocities of a
few hundred km/s. This gas is out of hydrostatic equilibrium and so can cool.
The clumps then grow larger as they decelerate and fall towards the center of
the cluster, eventually being accreted onto the super-massive black hole. The
general morphology, spatial distribution and estimated H{\alpha} morphology of
the clumps are in reasonable agreement with observations, although we do not
fully replicate the filamentary morphology of the clumps seen in the

galaxies at a constant cumulative number density, we explore the co-evolution

increase in the SFRs of galaxies at constant number density from z$\sim$6 to
z$\sim$3. The peak epoch of star formation is found to shift to later times for
galaxies with increasing number densities, in agreement with the expectations
from cosmic downsizing. The observed SFRs can fully account for the mass growth
to z$\sim$2 amongst galaxies with cumulative number densities greater than
10$^{-3.5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. For galaxies with a lower constant number density we
find the observed stellar masses are $\sim$3 times greater than that which may
be accounted for by the observed star formation alone at late times, implying
that growth from mergers plays an important role at $z<2$. We additionally
observe a decreasing sSFR, equivalent to approximately one order of magnitude,
from z$\sim$6 to z$\sim$2 amongst galaxies with number densities less than
10$^{-3.5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ along with significant evidence that at any redshift the
sSFR is higher for galaxies at higher number density. The combination of these
findings can qualitatively explain the previous findings of a sSFR plateau at

no unambiguous examples of quiescent galaxies at $z>4$.

with 4/5 at $z=4.3$ to $6.3$ (and the remaining source at $z=3.4$), and that
they are some of the most luminous dusty sources known. Comparison with
previous DSFG samples, mostly selected at longer wavelengths (e.g., 850 $\mu

selecting high-$z$ DSFGs, in the sense that a much larger fraction are at

like a jet clustering algorithm, they incorporate a jet radius parameter and a
transverse momentum cut. Three of the ubiquitous jet-based observables---jet
multiplicity, summed scalar transverse momentum, and missing transverse
momentum---have event shape counterparts that are closely correlated with their
jet-based cousins. Due to their ""local"" computational structure, these jet-like
event shapes could potentially be used for trigger-level event selection at the

non-integer values, highlighting the inherent ambiguity in defining jets. By
inverting jet multiplicity, we show how to characterize the transverse momentum

Since many physics applications do require knowledge about the jet
constituents, we also build a hybrid event shape that incorporates (local) jet

atmosphere with no TiO inversion layer, although a model with TiO inversion is
permitted in the dayside heat redistribution case, and we consider the
possibility of a day-night TiO cold trap in this object. For the first time, we
compare the IRAC colors of brown dwarfs and hot Jupiters as a function of

[3.6]-[4.5] color of 0.07+/-0.11, identical to that of isolated brown dwarfs of
similarly high temperature. In contrast, hot Jupiters generally show redder
[3.6]-[4.5] colors of ~0.4, with a very large range from ~0 to ~1. Evidently,
despite being more similar to hot Jupiters than to isolated brown dwarfs in
terms of external forcing of the atmosphere by stellar insolation, KELT-1b has
an atmosphere most like that of other brown dwarfs. This suggests that surface
gravity is very important in controlling the atmospheric systems of substellar

HI absorption and Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) continuum observations of the
Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN)-driven molecular outflow candidate NGC 1266.
Although other well-known systems with molecular outflows may be driven by star
formation in a central molecular disk, the molecular mass outflow rate reported
in Alatalo et al. (2011) in NGC 1266 of 13 M$_{\odot}$ year$^{-1}$ exceeds star
formation rate estimates from a variety of tracers. This suggests that an
additional energy source, such as an AGN, may play a significant role in
powering the outflow. Our high spatial resolution HI absorption data reveal
compact absorption against the radio continuum core co-located with the
putative AGN, and the presence of a blueshifted spectral component re-affirms
that gas is indeed flowing out of the system. Our VLBA observations at 1.65 GHz
reveal one continuum source within the densest portion of the molecular gas,
with a diameter d < 8 mas (1.2 pc), a radio power $P_{\mathrm{rad}}$ = 1.48
$\times$ 10$^{20}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, and a brightness temperature $T_{\mathrm{b}}$ >
1.5 x 10$^7$ K that is most consistent with an AGN origin. The radio continuum
energetics implied by the compact VLBA source, as well as archival VLA
continuum observations at lower spatial resolution, further support the
possibility that the AGN in NGC 1266 could be driving the molecular outflow.
These findings suggest that even low-level AGNs may be able to launch massive
outflows in their host galaxies.

power of quantum correlations as a resource. While bipartite entanglement and

relatively little is known about their multipartite counterpart. In this paper,
we apply and adapt the recently proposed definitions of multipartite
nonlocality [Phys. Rev. A 88, 014102] to the three- and four-partite scenario
to gain new insight on the resource aspect of multipartite nonlocal quantum
correlations. Specifically, we show that reproducing certain tripartite quantum
correlations requires mixtures of classical resources --- be it the ability to
change the groupings or the time orderings of measurements. Thus, when seen
from the perspective of biseparable one-way classical signaling resources,
certain tripartite quantum correlations do not admit a definite causal order.
In the four- partite scenario, we obtain a superset description of the set of
biseparable correlations which can be produced by allowing two groups of
bipartite non-signaling resources. Quantum violation of the resulting Bell-like
inequalities are investigated. As a byproduct, we obtain some new examples of
device-independent witnesses for genuine four-partite entanglement, and also
device-independent witnesses that allows one to infer the structure of the

single-top production the transverse mass has an end point determined by the W
mass, while the NP signals typically have an additional source of missing
energy. We compare, under the same conditions, our monotop search strategy with

the relic density, the constraint imposed from the null result of direct

us to single out only two viable dim-6 operators in the case of fermionic Dark

find that the scalar Higgs portal can provide a simple, concrete and realistic

fraction, Ks-band luminosity functions and mass functions for several

completeness limits for our photometry. We find an overall disk fraction of 7.7

$\pm$ 2.2 % in the outer parts of W3 Main. The mass functions derived for three

function of IRSN3 is complete down to 0.14 Msun and shows a break at M $\sim$
0.5 Msun. We interpret the higher disk fraction in the center as evidence for a
younger age of the cluster center. We find that the evolutionary sequence
observed in the low-mass stellar population is consistent with the observed age
spread among the massive stars. An analysis of the mass function variations
does not show evidence for mass segregation. W3 Main is currently still
actively forming stars, showing that the ionizing feedback of OB stars is

HOMFLY polynomials on representation R is naturally captured by symmetric group
characters (cut-and-join eigenvalues). The genus expansion and expansion
through Vassiliev invariants explicitly demonstrate this phenomenon. In the
present letter we claim that the superpolynomials are not functions of such a
type: symmetric group characters do not provide an adequate linear basis for
their expansions. Deformation to superpolynomials is, however, straightforward
in the multiplicative basis: the Casimir operators are \beta-deformed to
Hamiltonians of the Calogero-Moser-Sutherland system. Applying this trick to
the genus and Vassiliev expansions, we observe that the deformation is fully
straightforward only for the thin knots. Beyond the family of thin knots
additional algebraically independent terms appear in the Vassiliev and genus
expansions. This can suggest that the superpolynomials do in fact contain more
information about knots than the colored HOMFLY and Kauffman polynomials.
However, even for the thin knots the beta-deformation is non-innocent: already
in the simplest examples it seems inconsistent with the postivity of colored
superpolynomials in non-(anti)symmetric representations, which also happens in
I.Cherednik's (DAHA-based) approach to the torus knots.

characterize intercellular genomic heterogeneity must effectively distinguish
genuine clonal sequences from fake derivatives. We developed a novel approach
(SIGH) for identifying significant genuine clonal sequences directly from mixed
sequencing reads that can improve genomic analyses in many biological contexts.
This method offers several attractive features: (1) it automatically estimates
the error rate from raw sequence reads and identifies genuine clonal sequences;
(2) it is robust to the large variety of error rate due to the various
experimental conditions; (3) it is supported by a well grounded statistical
framework that exploits probabilistic characteristics of sequencing errors; (4)
its unbiased strategy allows detecting rare clone(s) despite that clone
relative abundance; and (5) it estimates constituent proportions in each
sample. Extensive realistic simulation studies show that our method can
reliably estimate the error rates and faithfully distinguish the genuine clones
from fake derivatives, paving the way for follow up analysis that is otherwise
ruined by the often dominant fake clones.

entropy growth for all proposals are directly related to a negative correlation
of similar fluctuations of the energy density and Hubble scalar. While this
correlation is evaluated locally for the CET proposal, it must be evaluated in
a non--local domain dependent manner for the two HB proposals. By looking at
the fulfillment of these conditions at the relevant asymptotic limits we are
able to provide a well grounded qualitative description of the full time
evolution and radial asymptotic scaling of the three entropies in generic
models. The following rigorous analytic results are obtained for the three
proposals: (i) entropy grows when the density growing mode is dominant, (ii)
all ever-expanding hyperbolic models reach a stable terminal equilibrium
characterized by an inhomogeneous entropy maximum in their late time evolution;
(iii) regions with decaying modes and collapsing elliptic models exhibit
unstable equilibria associated with an entropy minimum (iv) near singularities
the CET entropy diverges while the HB entropies converge; (v) the CET entropy
converges for all models in the radial asymptotic range, whereas the HB
entropies only converge for models asymptotic to an FLRW background. The fact
that different independent proposals yield fairly similar conditions for
entropy production, time evolution and radial scaling in generic LTB models

that tilted torus magnetic fields, defined as the sum of an internal/external

rotation axis, and an internal toroidal component, whose axis of symmetry is
aligned with the rotation axis, deform the star triaxially, unlike twisted

gravitational wave spectrum and polarization phase portraits. For example, the
relative amplitudes and frequencies of the spectral peaks allows one to infer
the relative strengths of the toroidal and poloidal components of the field,

species have different diffusion constants. In recent years, several studies
investigated the effects of noise on Turing patterns and showed that the
parameter regimes, for which stochastic Turing patterns are observed, can be
larger than the parameter regimes predicted by deterministic models, which are
written in terms of partial differential equations for species concentrations.
A common stochastic reaction-diffusion approach is written in terms of
compartment-based (lattice-based) models, where the domain of interest is
divided into artificial compartments and the number of molecules in each
compartment is simulated. In this paper, the dependence of stochastic Turing
patterns on the compartment size is investigated. It has previously been shown
(for relatively simpler systems) that a modeller should not choose compartment
sizes which are too small or too large, and that the optimal compartment size
depends on the diffusion constant. Taking these results into account, we
propose and study a compartment-based model of Turing patterns where each
chemical species is described using a different set of compartments. It is
shown that the parameter regions where spatial patterns form are different from
the regions obtained by classical deterministic PDE-based models, but they are
also different from the results obtained for the stochastic reaction-diffusion
models which use a single set of compartments for all chemical species. In
particular, it is argued that some previously reported results on the effect of
noise on Turing patterns in biological systems need to be reinterpreted.

asymptotic behaviors of the magnetization at long times. The distinct regimes
and the transitions between them are controlled by the interaction strength:
for weakly interacting fermions, the magnetization decays to zero. For
intermediate interactions, it displays undamped oscillations about zero and for
strong interactions, a partially magnetized state is dynamically stabilized.
The dynamics we find is a spin analog of interaction induced self-trapping in
double-well Bose Einstein condensates. The predicted phenomena can be realized

environment from Schwarzschild radii scales to distances of ~1 pc. In addition,
the average shape of the X-ray spectrum is an important input into X-ray
background synthesis models. Here, local (z \approx 0) AGN luminosity functions
(LFs) in five energy bands are used as a low-resolution, luminosity-dependent
X-ray spectrometer in order to constrain the average AGN X-ray spectrum between
0.5 and 200 keV. The 15-55 keV LF measured by Swift-BAT is assumed to be the
best determination of the local LF, and then a spectral model is varied to
determine the best fit to the 0.5-2 keV, 2-10 keV, 3-20 keV and 14-195 keV LFs.
The spectral model consists of a Gaussian distribution of power-laws with a
mean photon-index <\Gamma> and cutoff energy E_cut, as well as contributions
from distant and disc reflection. The reflection strength is parameterised by
varying the Fe abundance relative to solar, A_Fe, and requiring a specific Fe K
equivalent width (EW). In this way, the presence of the X-ray Baldwin effect
can be tested. The spectral model that best fits the four LFs has <\Gamma> =
1.85 \pm 0.15, E_cut=270^{+170}_{-80} keV, A_Fe=0.3^{+0.3}_{-0.15} (90% C.L.).
The sub-solar A_Fe indicates the presence of strong reflection given the
assumed Fe K EW. Indeed, parameterising the reflection strength with the R
parameter gives R=1.7^{+1.7}_{-0.85}. There is moderate evidence for no X-ray
Baldwin effect. A critical result of our procedure is that the shape of the
local 2-10 keV LF measured by HEAO-1 and MAXI is incompatible with the LFs
measured in the hard X-rays by Swift-BAT and RXTE. We therefore present a new
determination of the local 2-10 keV LF that is consistent with all other energy
bands.This new LF should be used to revise current measurements of the evolving
AGN LF in the 2-10 keV band.

For continuous time EH, the EH time can be any percentage of the total
transmission block time. For discrete time EH, the whole transmission block is
either used for EH or IT. The proposed protocols are attractive because they do
not require channel state information at the transmitter side and enable relay
transmission with preset fixed transmission power. We derive analytical
expressions of the achievable throughput for the proposed protocols. The
derived expressions are verified by comparison with simulations and allow the
system performance to be determined as a function of the system parameters.

that it is of class $C^2$ with respect to the temperature. We next deal with
the case where the potential is not a constant but a function. When the

cognitive and behavioral function, we have found that hemi-lateralized pairs of
oscillations such as left and right occipital alpha, or left and right rolandic
mu dissociate spectrally. That is, they show a shifted frequency distribution,
with one member of the pair peaking at a slightly lower frequency than the
other. To illustrate the phenomenon, we analyze EEG spatio-spectral patterns
providing examples of dissociations in the 10Hz frequency band. Our
observations suggest that homologous pairs of neuromarkers have distinct
intrinsic frequencies and only transiently coordinate their oscillations into
synchronous ensembles. On occasion, hemi-lateralized pairs are observed to
blend into medial aggregates, leading to strongly coherent dynamics. We
hypothesize that spectral dissociation plays a role in the balance of
integration and segregation in the brain: separation of oscillations from
homologous cortical areas allows them to function independently under certain
circumstances, while preserving a potential for stronger interactions supported
by structural and functional symmetries. As a method, spectral dissociation may
be harnessed to better track the individual power of each member of a
hemi-lateralized pair, and their respective time-courses. Resulting insights
may shed light on the functional interaction between homologous cortices in
studies of attention (alpha), e.g. during perceptual and social interaction
tasks, and in studies of somatomotor processing (mu), e.g. in bimanual

need for real-time analysis of such large graph streams has led to progress on
low memory, one-pass streaming graph algorithms. These algorithms were designed
for simple graphs, assuming an edge is not repeated in the stream. Real graph
streams however, are almost always multigraphs i.e., they contain many
duplicate edges. The assumption of no repeated edges requires an extra pass
*storing all the edges* just for deduplication, which defeats the purpose of
small memory algorithms.
  We describe an algorithm for estimating the triangle count of a multigraph
stream of edges. We show that all previous streaming algorithms for triangle
counting fail for multigraph streams, despite their impressive accuracies for
simple graphs. The bias created by duplicate edges is a major problem, and
leads these algorithms astray. Our algorithm avoids these biases through
careful debiasing strategies and has provable theoretical guarantees and
excellent empirical performance. Our algorithm builds on the previously
introduced wedge sampling methodology.
  Another challenge in analyzing temporal graphs is finding the right temporal
window size. Our algorithm seamlessly handles multiple time windows, and does
not require committing to any window size(s) a priori. We apply our algorithm
to discover fascinating transitivity and triangle trends in real-world graph
streams.

for the dynamic instability of microtubules in the presence of diffusion and
all of the fundamental dynamics parameters. Our stability analysis introduces
the phase transition method as a new mathematical tool in the study of

a discounted infinite horizon Markov decision process (MDP). The objective is
to find a transmission control policy that minimizes the symbol delay, buffer
overflow and transmission power consumption and error rate simultaneously and
in the long run. By using the concepts of submodularity, multimodularity and
L-natural convexity, we study the structure of the optimal policy searched by

treatment introduced here. Concepts are viewed not as fixed representations,
but entities existing in states of potentiality that require interaction with a
context-a stimulus or another concept-to 'collapse' to an instantiated form
(e.g. exemplar, prototype, or other possibly imaginary instance). The stimulus
situation plays the role of the measurement in physics, acting as context that
induces a change of the cognitive state from superposition state to collapsed
state. The collapsed state is more likely to consist of a conjunction of
concepts for associative than analytic thought because more stimulus or concept
properties take part in the collapse. We provide two contextual measures of
conceptual distance-one using collapse probabilities and the other weighted
properties-and show how they can be applied to conjunctions using the pet fish
problem.

is determined by the net magnetic field induced by the deviation of precession
angle from its equilibrium position after precession process. The error rate
has the lowest value under an appropriate applied external field for the
voltage pulse duration ${\tau}_{pulse}$ a little longer than the half
precession period. The calculated results show that ultra-low error rate down
to the order of $10^{-12}$ can be achieved for thermal stability factor
{\Delta} = 50 and low damping factor material should be used for free layer to
improve the switching probability. For parallel (anti-parallel) magnetization
to anti-parallel (parallel) magnetization switching process, the spin transfer
torque tends to decrease (increase) the error rate when the ${\tau}_{pulse}$ is
shorter than the half precession period, and increase (decrease) the error rate
when ${\tau}_{pulse}$ is longer than the half-period. These results exhibit

the linear convergence of CB-SARS on\emph{scaling-invariant} objective

aswell as many non quasi-convex and non-continuousfunctions. On
scaling-invariant functions, we show the existence of ahomogeneous Markov

scale-invariance and invariance tostrictly increasing transformation of the
objective function). We thenderive sufficient conditions for \emph{global

is necessary to have appropriate error assessment for related quantities.
Usually the fractal dimension $D$ is derived from the Hurst exponent $H$ via
the relation $D=2-H$, and the Hurst exponent can be evaluated by analyzing the
dependence of the rescaled range $\langle|F(t+\tau)-F(t)|\rangle$ on the time
span $\tau$. For fBms, the error of the rescaled range not only depends on data
sampling but also varies with $H$ due to the presence of long term memory. This
error for a given time series then can not be assessed without knowing the
fractal dimension. We carry out extensive numerical simulations to explore the
error of rescaled range of fBms and find that for $0<H<0.5$, $|F(t+\tau)-F(t)|$
can be treated as independent for time spans without overlap; for $0.5<H<1$,
the long term memory makes $|F(t+\tau)-F(t)|$ correlated and an approximate
method is given to evaluate the error of $\langle|F(t+\tau)-F(t)|\rangle$. The
error and fractal dimension can then be determined self-consistently in the
modeling of a time series with fBms.

Seyfert 1 galaxy ESO 323-G77. The source exhibits remarkable spectral
variability from months to years timescales. The observed spectral variability
is entirely due to variations of the column density of a neutral absorber
towards the intrinsic nuclear continuum. The column density is generally
Compton-thin ranging from a few times 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ to a few times
10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. However, one observation reveals a Compton-thick state
with column density of the order of 1.5 $\times$ 10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$. The
observed variability offers a rare opportunity to study the properties of the
X-ray absorber(s) in an active galaxy. We identify variable X-ray absorption
from two different components, namely (i) a clumpy torus whose individual
clumps have a density of $\leq$ 1.7 $\times$ 10$^8$ cm$^{-3}$ and an average
column density of $\sim$ 4 $\times$ 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, and (ii) the broad
line region (BLR), comprising individual clouds with density of 0.1-8 $\times$
10$^9$ cm$^{-3}$ and column density of 10$^{23}$-10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$. The
derived properties of the clumpy torus can also be used to estimate the torus
half-opening angle, which is of the order of 47 $^\circ$. We also confirm the
previously reported detection of two highly ionized warm absorbers with outflow
velocities of 1000-4000 km s$^{-1}$. The observed outflow velocities are
consistent with the Keplerian/escape velocity at the BLR. Hence, the warm
absorbers may be tentatively identified with the warm/hot inter-cloud medium
which ensures that the BLR clouds are in pressure equilibrium with their
surroundings. The BLR line-emitting clouds may well be the cold, dense clumps
of this outflow, whose warm/hot phase is likely more homogeneous, as suggested
by the lack of strong variability of the warm absorber(s) properties during our
monitoring.

J185246.6+003317 is $<1.1\times 10^{-13}$ s s$^{-1}$, which, together with the
long period P=11.558714(2) s, indicates a dipolar surface magnetic field of
$<3.6\times 10^{-13}$ G, a characteristic age of $>1.7$ Myr, and a spin-down
luminosity of $<2.8\times 10^{30}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The X-ray spectrum of the
source is best-fitted with a resonant Compton scattering model, and can be also
adequately described by a blackbody model. The observations covering a seven
month span from 2008 to 2009 show variations in the spectral properties of the
source, with the luminosity decreasing from $2.7\times 10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to
$4.6 \times 10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$, along with a decrease of the blackbody
temperature from $kT\approx 0.8$ keV to $\approx0.6$ keV. The X-ray luminosity
of the source is higher than its spin-down luminosity, ruling out rotation as a
power source. The combined timing and spectral properties, the non-detection of
any optical or infrared counterpart, together with the lack of detection of the
source in archival X-ray data prior to the 2008 XMM-Newton observation, point
to this source being a newly discovered transient low-B magnetar undergoing an
outburst decay during the XMM-Newton observations. The non-detection by Chandra
in 2001 sets an upper limit $4\times 10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to the quiescent
luminosity of 3XMM J185246.6+003317. Its period is the longest among currently
known transient magnetars. The foreground absorption toward 3XMM

process where the energy is injected at large, fluid scales and dissipated at
small, kinetic scales. Accurately modelling the global evolution requires to
take into account the main micro-scale physical processes of interest. This is
why comparison of different plasma models is today an imperative task aiming at
understanding cross-scale processes in plasmas. We report here the first
comparative study of the evolution of a magnetized shear flow, through a
variety of different plasma models by using magnetohydrodynamic, Hall-MHD,
two-fluid, hybrid kinetic and full kinetic codes. Kinetic relaxation effects
are discussed to emphasize the need for kinetic equilibriums to study the
dynamics of collisionless plasmas in non trivial configurations. Discrepancies
between models are studied both in the linear and in the nonlinear regime of
the magnetized Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, to highlight the effects of small
scale processes on the nonlinear evolution of collisionless plasmas. We
illustrate how the evolution of a magnetized shear flow depends on the relative
orientation of the fluid vorticity with respect to the magnetic field direction
during the linear evolution when kinetic effects are taken into account. Even
if we found that small scale processes differ between the different models, we
show that the feedback from small, kinetic scales to large, fluid scales is
negligable in the nonlinear regime. This study show that the kinetic modeling
validates the use of a fluid approach at large scales, which encourages the
development and use of fluid codes to study the nonlinear evolution of
magnetized fluid flows, even in the colisionless regime.

M1-9, and SaSt2-3) are new detections. We analyzed the spectra, along with
ancillary data, using the photo-ionization code CLOUDY to establish the atomic
line fluxes, and determine the properties of the radiation field, as set by the
effective temperature of the central star. In addition, we measured the
infrared spectral features due to dust grains. We find that the Polycyclic
Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) profile over 6-9 um in these C60-bearing carbon-rich
PNe is of the more chemically-processed class A. The intensity ratio of 3.3 um
to 11.3 um PAH indicates that the number of C-atoms per PAH in C60-containing
PNe is small compared to that in non-C60 PNe. The Spitzer spectra also show
broad dust features around 11 and 30 um. Analysis of the 30-um feature shows
that it is strongly correlated with the continuum, and we propose that a single
carbon-based carrier is responsible for both the continuum and the feature. The
strength of the 11-um feature is correlated to the temperature of the dust,
suggesting that it is at least partially due to a solid-state carrier. The
chemical abundances of C60-containing PNe can be explained by AGB
nucleosynthesis models for initially 1.5-2.5 Msun stars with Z=0.004. We
plotted the locations of C60-containing PNe on a face-on map of the Milky Way
and we found that most of these PNe are outside the solar circle, consistent
with low metallicity values. Their metallicity suggests that the progenitors
are an older population.

distant galaxies and to quantify the main uncertainties affecting their
measurement. We explore the impact of the assumptions made in their derivation
with standard calibrations or through a fitting process, as well as the impact
of the available data, focusing on the role of IR emission originating from
dust. We build a sample of galaxies with z>1, all observed from the UV to the
IR (rest frame). The data are fitted with the code CIGALE, which is also used
to build and analyse a catalogue of mock galaxies. Models with different SFHs
are introduced. We define different set of data, with or without a good
sampling of the UV range, NIR, and thermal IR data. The impact of these
different cases on the determination of M_star and SFR are analysed.
Exponentially decreasing models with a redshift formation of the stellar
population z ~8 cannot fit the data correctly. The other models fit the data
correctly at the price of unrealistically young ages when the age of the single
stellar population is taken to be a free parameter. The best fits are obtained
with two stellar populations. As long as one measurement of the dust emission
continuum is available, SFR are robustly estimated whatever the chosen model
is, including standard recipes. M_star measurement is more subject to
uncertainty, depending on the chosen model and the presence of NIR data, with
an impact on the SFR-M_star scatter plot. Conversely, when thermal IR data from
dust emission are missing, the uncertainty on SFR measurements largely exceeds
that of stellar mass. Among all physical properties investigated here, the
stellar ages are found to be the most difficult to constrain and this
uncertainty acts as a second parameter in SFR measurements and as the most
important parameter for M_star measurements.

  In this paper, we model the species assemblages (compositional data) by the
zero-inflated multinomial distribution, while modelling the species response
functions using Dirichlet process based Gaussian mixtures. This modelling
strategy yielded significantly improved performances, and a formal Bayesian
test of model adequacy, developed recently, showed that our new model is

cannot be explained by conventional hadronic models. For example, the observed
magnitude of the transverse cross section is significantly underestimated in a
framework with Reggeized background amplitudes.
  [Purpose] Develop a phenomenological framework for the $N(e,e'\pi^\pm)N'$
reaction at high invariant mass $W$ and deep photon virtuality $Q^2$.
  [Method] Building on the work of Kaskulov and Mosel, a gauged pion-exchange
current is introduced with a running cutoff energy for the proton
electromagnetic transition form factor. A new transition form factor is
proposed. It respects the correct on-shell limit, has a simple physical
interpretation and reduces the number of free parameters by one.
  [Results] A study of the $W$ dependence of the $N(e,e'\pi^\pm)N'$ lends
support for the newly proposed transition form factor. In addition, an improved
description of the separated and unseparated cross sections at $-t \lesssim 0.5
\;\text{GeV}^2$ is obtained. The predictions overshoot the measured unseparated
cross sections for $-t > 0.5 \;\text{GeV}^2$. Introducing a strong hadronic
form factor in the Reggeized background amplitudes brings the calculations
considerably closer to the high $-t$ data.
  [Conclusions] Hadronic models corrected for resonance/parton duality describe
the separated pion electroproduction cross sections above the resonance region
reasonably well at low $-t$. In order to validate the applicability of these
models at high $-t$, separated cross sections are needed. These are expected to
provide a more profound insight into the relevant reaction mechanisms.

  We point out interesting differences in the spin-split conduction band

intrinsic SOC is an effective out-of-plane $g$-factor for the electrons which
differs from the free-electron g-factor $g\simeq 2$. We identify a new term in
the Hamiltonian of the Bychkov-Rashba SOC which does not exist in III-V
semiconductors. Using first-principles calculations, we give estimates of the
various parameters appearing in the theory.
  Finally, we consider quantum dots (QDs) formed in TMDC materials and derive
an effective Hamiltonian which allows us to calculate the magnetic field
dependence of the bound states in the QDs. We find that all states are both
valley and spin split, which suggests that these QDs could be used as
valley-spin filters.
  We explore the possibility of using spin and valley states in TMDCs as

(such as sterile neutrinos) which acquire non-negligible thermal velocities in
the early universe. These particles could behave as warm dark matter (WDM) and
generate a small-scale cutoff in the linear density power spectrum which scales
approximately inversely with the particle mass. If this mass is of order a keV,
the cutoff occurs on the scale of dwarf galaxies. Thus, in WDM models the
abundance of small galaxies, such as the satellites that orbit in the halo of
the Milky Way, depends on the mass of the warm particle. The abundance also
scales with the mass of the host galactic halo. We use the \galform
semi-analytic model of galaxy formation to calculate the properties of galaxies
in universes in which the dark matter is warm. Using this method, we can
compare the predicted satellite luminosity functions to the observed data for
the Milky Way dwarf spheroidals, and determine a lower bound on the thermally
produced WDM particle mass. This depends strongly on the value of the Milky Way
halo mass and, to some extent, on the baryonic physics assumed; we examine both
of these dependencies. For our fiducial model we find that for a particle mass
of 3.3 keV (the 2$\sigma$ lower limit found by Viel et al. from a recent
analysis of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest) the Milky Way halo mass is required to
be $> 1.4 \times 10^{12}$ \msun. For this same fiducial model, we also find
that all WDM particle masses are ruled out (at 95% confidence) if the halo of
the Milky Way has a mass smaller than $1.1 \times 10^{12}$ \msun, while if the
mass of the Galactic halo is greater than 1.8 $\times 10^{12}$ \msun, only WDM
particle masses larger than 2 keV are allowed.

origin of these discrepancies. We find that strong chemical mixing largely
resolves the photometric mismatch at early times, but it leads to an enhanced
line broadening that contrasts, for example, with the markedly narrow SiII6355A

pulsational-delayed detonations (PDDEL model series). Because of the pulsation,
PDDEL models retain more unburnt carbon, have little mass at high velocity, and
have a much hotter outer ejecta after the explosion. The pulsation does not
influence the inner ejecta, so PDDEL and DDC models exhibit similar radiative
properties beyond maximum. However, at early times, PDDEL models show bluer
optical colors and a higher luminosity, even for weak mixing. Their early-time
radiation is derived primarily from the initial shock-deposited energy in the
outer ejecta rather than radioactive decay heating. Furthermore, PDDEL models
show short-lived CII lines, reminiscent of SN 2013dy. They typically exhibit
lines that are weaker, narrower, and of near-constant width, reminiscent of SN
2011fe. In addition to multi-dimensional effects, varying configurations for

orbit while performing cyclotron motion. The wave packet splits into two peaks
with unequal amplitudes after a certain time depending on spin-orbit coupling
constant. This unequal splitting of the wave packet is attributed to the cubic
Rashba interaction for heavy holes. The difference in the peak amplitudes
disappears with time. At a certain time the two peaks diffuse almost along the

interfere and as a result a completely randomized pattern of the wave packet is

collectively behaving matter, one would expect the elliptic flow to decrease at
lower beam energies, where the QGP is not produced. However, in the recent RHIC
beam energy scan, it has been found that the inclusive charged hadron elliptic
flow changes relatively little in magnitude in the energies between 7.7 and 39

the elliptic and triangular flow utilizing a Boltzmann + hydrodynamics hybrid
model. Such a hybrid model provides a natural framework for the transition from
high collision energies, where the hydrodynamical description is essential, to
smaller energies, where the hadron transport dominates. This approach is thus
suitable to investigate the relative importance of these two mechanisms for the

interpreted as EBs, are often spatially correlated with increases in the
intensity of the FeI 6302.5A line core. Bi-polar regions inferred from
Hinode/SOT magnetic field data show evidence of flux cancellation associated,
co-spatially, with these EBs, suggesting magnetic reconnection could be a
driver of these high-energy events. Through the analysis of similar events in
the simulated lower atmosphere, we are able to infer that line profiles
analogous to the observations occur co-spatially with regions of strong
opposite polarity magnetic flux. These observed events and their simulated
counterparts are interpreted as evidence of photospheric magnetic reconnection
at scales observable using current observational instrumentation.

of many-body physics. The interaction between dipoles is {\it anisotropic} and
{\it long-range}. While the former allows to observe rich effects due to
different geometries of the system, long-range ($1/r^3$) interactions lead to
strong correlations between dipoles and frustration. In effect, interacting
dipoles in a lattice form a paradigmatic system with strong correlations and
exotic properties with possible applications in quantum information
technologies, and as quantum simulators of condensed matter physics, material
science, etc. Notably, such a system is extremely difficult to model due to a
proliferation of interaction induced multi-band excitations for sufficiently
strong dipole-dipole interactions. In this article we develop a consistent
theoretical model of interacting polar molecules in a lattice by applying the
concepts and ideas of ionization theory which allows us to include highly
excited Bloch bands. Additionally, by involving concepts from quantum optics
(population trapping), we show that one can induce frustration and engineer
exotic states, such as Majumdar-Ghosh state, or vector-chiral states in such a
system.

absorption by specialized biological antenna complexes, charge separation,
exciton formation and energy transfer to localized reaction centers culminates
in the conversion of solar to chemical energy. A notable feature in these
processes is the exceptionally high efficiencies ($>$ 95\%) at which excitation
is transferred from the illuminated protein complex site to the reaction
centers. The high speeds of excitation propagation within a system of
interwoven biomolecular network structures, is yet to be replicated in
artificial light harvesting complexes. A clue to unraveling the quantum puzzles
of nature may lie in the observations of long lived coherences lasting several
picoseconds in the electronic spectra of photosynthetic complexes which occurs
even in noisy environmental baths. The exact nature of the association between
the high energy propagation rates and strength of quantum coherences remains
largely unsolved. This review presents recent developments in quantum theories,
and links information-theoretic aspects with photosynthetic light-harvesting
processes in biomolecular systems. There is examination of various attempts to
pinpoint the processes that underpin coherence features arising from the light
harvesting activities of biomolecular systems, with particular emphasis on the
effects that factors such non-Markovianity, zeno mechanisms, teleportation,
quantum predictability and the role of multipartite states have on the quantum
dynamics of biomolecular systems. A discussion of how quantum thermodynamical
principles and agent-based modeling and simulation approaches can improve our

factorization property of $SU(2)$ coherent states upon splitting or decay of a

viewed as comprising two, three or more spin subsystems. From this perspective,
we investigate the multipartite quantum correlations defined as the sum of the
correlations of all possible bi-partitions. The pairwise quantum correlations
are quantified by entanglement of formation and quantum discord. A special
attention is devoted to tripartite splitting schemes. We explicitly derive the
sum of entanglement of formation for all possible bi-partitions. It coincides
with the sum of all possible pairwise quantum discord. The conservation
relation between the distribution of entanglement of formation and quantum
discord, in the tripartite splitting scheme, is discussed. We show that the
entanglement of formation and quantum discord possess the monogamy property for
even spin coherent states, contrarily to odd ones which violate the monogamy
relation when the the overlap of the coherent states approaches the unity.

space remain practically unchanged as different sets of messages are
considered. The activity of participants follows the expected scale-free trace,
thus yielding the hub, intermediary and peripheral classes of vertices by
comparison against the Erd\""os-R\'enyi model. The relative sizes of these three

Typically, $<15\%$ of the vertices are hubs, 15-45\% are intermediary and
$>45\%$ are peripheral vertices. Similar results for the distribution of

spectral analysis of semigroups in a general Banach space setting. It presents
some new and more general versions, and provides comprehensible proofs, of
classical results such as the spectral mapping theorem, some (quantified)
Weyl's Theorems and the Krein-Rutman Theorem. Motivated by evolution PDE
applications, the results apply to a wide and natural class of generators which
split as a dissipative part plus a more regular part, without assuming any
symmetric structure on the operators nor Hilbert structure on the space, and
give some growth estimates and spectral gap estimates for the associated
semigroup. The approach relies on some factorization and summation arguments
reminiscent of the Dyson-Phillips series in the spirit of those used in
[87,82,48,81]. (2) On the other hand, we present the semigroup spectral
analysis for three important classes of ""growth-fragmentation"" equations,
namely the cell division equation, the self-similar fragmentation equation and
the McKendrick-Von Foerster age structured population equation. By showing that
these models lie in the class of equations for which our general semigroup
analysis theory applies, we prove the exponential rate of convergence of the
solutions to the associated remarkable profile for a very large and natural

and statistics and is especially useful for parameter estimation in exponential
families where parameters are known to lie on a Riemannian manifold.
Connections between the geometric properties of the induced manifold and
statistical properties of the estimation problem are well-established. However
developing first-order methods that scale to larger problems has been less of a
focus in the information geometry community. The best known algorithm that
incorporates manifold structure is the second-order natural gradient descent
algorithm introduced by Amari. On the other hand, stochastic approximation
methods have led to the development of first-order methods for optimizing noisy
objective functions. A recent generalization of the Robbins-Monro algorithm
known as mirror descent, developed by Nemirovski and Yudin is a first order
method that induces non-Euclidean geometries. However current analysis of
mirror descent does not precisely characterize the induced non-Euclidean
geometry nor does it consider performance in terms of statistical relative
efficiency. In this paper, we prove that mirror descent induced by Bregman
divergences is equivalent to the natural gradient descent algorithm on the dual
Riemannian manifold. Using this equivalence, it follows that (1) mirror descent
is the steepest descent direction along the Riemannian manifold of the
exponential family; (2) mirror descent with log-likelihood loss applied to
parameter estimation in exponential families asymptotically achieves the
classical Cram\'er-Rao lower bound and (3) natural gradient descent for
manifolds corresponding to exponential families can be implemented as a
first-order method through mirror descent.

pulsar and the first source of this class showing direct evidence for
transition between accretion and rotational powered emission states. These
swing provided the strongest confirmation of the pulsar recycling scenario
available so far. During the two XMM-Newton observations that were carried out
while the source was in outburst in April 2013, IGR J18245-2452 displayed a
unique and peculiar variability of its X-ray emission. In this work, we report
on a detailed analysis of the XMM- Newton data and focus in particular on the
timing and spectral variability of the source. IGR J18245-2452 continuously
switches between lower and higher intensity states, with typical variations in
flux up to a factor of about 500 in time scales as short as few seconds. These
variations in the source intensity are sometimes associated to a dramatic
spectral hardening, during which the power-law photon index of the source
changes from Gamma=1.7 to Gamma=0.9. The pulse profiles extracted at different
count rates and energies show a complex variability. These phenomena are not
usually observed in accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars, at least not on such a
short time scale. Fast variability was also found in the ATCA radio
observations carried out for about 6 hours during the outburst at a frequency
of 5.5 and 9 GHz. We interpret the variability observed from IGR J18245-2452 in
terms of a ""hiccup"" accretion phase, during which the accretion of material
from the inner boundary of the Keplerian disk is reduced by the onset of
centrifugal inhibition of accretion, possibly causing the launch of strong
outflows. Changes across accretion and propeller regimes have been long
predicted and reproduced by MHD simulations of accreting millisecond X-ray
pulsars but never observed to produce an extreme variability as that shown by
IGR J18245-2452.

and Bob, receive inputs taken from a probability distribution. Each of them
produces an output and they win the game if they satisfy some predicate on
their inputs/outputs. The entangled value $\omega^*(G)$ of a game $G$ is the
maximum probability that Alice and Bob can win the game if they are allowed to
share an entangled state prior to receiving their inputs.
  The $n$-fold parallel repetition $G^n$ of $G$ consists of $n$ instances of
$G$ where the players receive all the inputs at the same time and produce all
the outputs at the same time. They win $G^n$ if they win each instance of $G$.
  In this paper we show that for any game $G$ such that $\omega^*(G) = 1 -
\varepsilon < 1$, $\omega^*(G^n)$ decreases exponentially in $n$. First, for
any game $G$ on the uniform distribution, we show that $\omega^*(G^n) = (1 -
\varepsilon^2)^{\Omega\left(\frac{n}{\log(|I||O|)} -
|\log(\varepsilon)|\right)}$, where $|I|$ and $|O|$ are the sizes of the input
and output sets. From this result, we show that for any entangled game $G$,
$\omega^*(G^n) \le (1 - \varepsilon^2)^{\Omega(\frac{n}{Q\log(|I||O|)} -
\frac{|\log(\varepsilon)|}{Q})}$ where $p$ is the input distribution of $G$ and
$Q= \frac{|I|^2 \max_{xy} p_{xy}^2 }{\min_{xy} p_{xy} }$. This implies parallel
repetition with exponential decay as long as $\min_{xy} \{p_{xy}\} \neq 0$ for
general games. To prove this parallel repetition, we introduce the concept of
\emph{Superposed Information Cost} for entangled games which is inspired from
the information cost used in communication complexity.

($T_{\mathrm eff}\approx5000$ K, $\log g=2.5$), and characterized by four
different metallicities, [M/H] = 0.0, -1.0, -2.0, -3.0. The role of convection
in the spectral line formation is assessed with the aid of abundance
corrections, i.e., the differences in abundances predicted for a given
equivalent width of a particular spectral line with the 3D and 1D model
atmospheres. We find that for lines of certain neutral atoms the abundance
corrections strongly depend both on metallicity of a given model atmosphere and
the line excitation potential. While abundance corrections for all lines of
both neutral and ionized elements tend to be small at solar metallicity, for
lines of neutral elements with low ionization potential and low-to-intermediate
$\chi$ they quickly increase with decreasing metallicity, reaching in their
extremes to -0.6...-0.8 dex. In all such cases the large abundance corrections
are due to horizontal temperature fluctuations in the 3D hydrodynamical models.
Abundance corrections of molecular lines are very sensitive to metallicity of
the underlying model atmosphere and may be larger (in absolute value) than -0.5
dex at [M/H] = -3.0 (-1.5 dex in the case of CO). We also find that an
approximate treatment of scattering in the 3D model calculations leads to the
abundance corrections that are altered by less than ~0.1 dex, both for atomic
and molecular (CO) lines, with respect to the model where scattering is treated
as true absorption throughout the entire atmosphere, with the largest
differences for the resonance and low-excitation lines.

reaches the CHEOPS (CHaracterising ExOPlanets Satellite) detector. It will
carry out follow-up measurements on transiting planets. This requires exquisite
data that can be acquired only by a space-borne observatory and by well
understood and mitigated sources of noise. Earth stray light is one of them
which becomes the most prominent noise for faint stars.
  A software suite was developed to evaluate the contamination by the stray
light. As the satellite will be launched in late 2017, the year 2018 is
analysed for three different altitudes. Given an visible region at any time,
the stray light contamination is simulated at the entrance of the telescope.
The amount that reaches the detector is, however, much lower, as it is reduced
by the point source transmittance function.
  Information about the faintest star visible in any direction in the sky is
therefore available and is compared to a potential list of targets. The
influence of both the visibility region and the unavoidable South Atlantic
Anomaly are also studied as well as the effect of a changing optical assembly.
A methodology to compute the visible region of the sky and the stray light flux
is described. Techniques to prepare the scheduling of the observation and a
possible way of calibrating the dark current and the map of hot pixels are
presented.
  The simulations show that there are seasonal variations on the amount of flux
received and on the altitude. However, the South Atlantic Anomaly impacts more
direly higher orbits. This high radiation region demand the interruption of the
science operations. Even if the viewing zone at low altitude is smaller, the
availability of instrument is greater. There exist two favoured regions for the
observations. The field of view is the widest then as the plane of the orbit
and of the terminator merge.

environment. One of challenges of energy efficient resource allocation for VMs
in HPC cloud is tradeoff between minimizing total energy consumption of
physical machines (PMs) and satisfying Quality of Service (e.g. performance).
On one hand, cloud providers want to maximize their profit by reducing the
power cost (e.g. using the smallest number of running PMs). On the other hand,
cloud customers (users) want highest performance for their applications. In
this paper, we focus on the scenario that scheduler does not know global
information about user jobs and user applications in the future. Users will
request shortterm resources at fixed start times and non interrupted durations.
We then propose a new allocation heuristic (named Energy-aware and Performance
per watt oriented Bestfit (EPOBF)) that uses metric of performance per watt to
choose which most energy-efficient PM for mapping each VM (e.g. maximum of MIPS
per Watt). Using information from Feitelson's Parallel Workload Archive to
model HPC jobs, we compare the proposed EPOBF to state of the art heuristics on
heterogeneous PMs (each PM has multicore CPU). Simulations show that the EPOBF
can reduce significant total energy consumption in comparison with state of the
art allocation heuristics.

This transitional source represents the most convincing proof of the
evolutionary link shared by accreting neutron stars in low mass X-ray binaries,

states take place on the same time-scales of luminosity variations of X-ray

  While accreting mass, the X-ray emission of IGR J18245-2452 varies
dramatically on time-scales ranging from a second to a few hours. We interpret
a state characterised by a lower flux and pulsed fraction, and by sudden
increases of the hardness of the X-ray emission, in terms of the onset of a
magnetospheric centrifugal inhibition of the accretion flow. Prospects of
finding new members of the newly established class of transitional pulsars are

hadronic model of emission of $\gamma$-rays above 100 MeV and their
implications. We focus here on the joint $\gamma$-ray and neutrino production
resulting from proton-proton interactions within the binary system. We find
that the required proton injection kinetic power, necessary to explain the
$\gamma$-ray flux observed by AGILE and Fermi-LAT, is $L_p \sim
10^{38}\:\rm{erg\:s^{-1}}$, a value in agreement with the average bolometric
luminosity of the hypersoft state (when Cygnus X-3 was repeatedly observed to
produce transient $\gamma$-ray activity). If we assume an increase of the wind
density at the superior conjunction, the asymmetric production of $\gamma$-rays
along the orbit can reproduce the observed modulation. According to
observational constraints and our modelling, a maximal flux of high-energy
neutrinos would be produced for an initial proton distribution with a power-law
index $\alpha=2.4$. The predicted neutrino flux is almost two orders of
magnitude less than the 2-month IceCube sensitivity at $\sim$1 TeV. If the
protons are accelerated up to PeV energies, the predicted neutrino flux for a
prolonged ""soft X-ray state"" would be a factor of about 3 lower than the 1-year
IceCube sensitivity at $\sim$10 TeV. This study shows that, for a prolonged
soft state (as observed in 2006) possibly related with $\gamma$-ray activity

repulsive interactions. Confining the system between parallel walls can
qualitatively change its appearance: a laning state can emerge that is
different from the ones previously reported. All lanes show on average the same
migration direction of the contained particles with a finite separation
distance between the lanes. Furthermore, in certain parameter ranges we observe
collectively migrating clusters that arrange in an approximately hexagonal way.
We suggest that the mechanism behind these regular textures is an overreaction

geometry with the barrier potential situated in the middle of an additional -
experimentally typical - harmonic confinement gives rise to particularly
well-observable signatures. In the elastic scattering regime we investigate
signatures of NOON-states on the $N$-particle level within an effective
potential approach. We show that removing the barrier potential and
subsequently recombining both parts of the quantum superposition leads to a
high-contrast interference pattern in the center-of-mass coordinate for narrow
and broad potential barriers. We demonstrate that the presented signatures can
be used to clearly distinguish quantum superpositions states from statistical
mixtures and are sufficiently robust against experimentally relevant
excitations of the center-of-mass wave function to higher lying oscillator
states. For two-particle solitons we extend these considerations to
low-fidelity superposition states: even for strong deviations from the

${\rm BR}(K^+ \to \pi^+\nu\bar{\nu})$ with $\sim$10% precision. This will
require the observation of $10^{13}$ $K^+$ decays in the experiment's fiducial
volume, as well as the use of high-performance systems for precision tracking,
particle identification, and photon vetoing. These aspects of the experiment
will also allow NA62 to carry out a rich program of searches for lepton flavor
and/or number violating $K^+$ decays. Part of the experimental apparatus was
commissioned during a technical run in 2012; installation continues and data
taking is expected to begin in late 2014. The physics prospects and the status
of the NA62 experiment are reviewed.

function of a thermal system expressed in a moving frame has a natural

boundary conditions. The Poincare' invariance underlying a relativistic theory
implies a dependence of the free-energy on the compact length L_0 and the shift
xi only through the combination beta=L_0(1+xi^2)^(1/2). This in turn implies
that the energy and the momentum distributions of the thermal theory are
related, a fact which is encoded in a set of Ward identities among the
correlators of the energy-momentum tensor. The latter have interesting
applications in lattice field theory: they offer novel ways to compute
thermodynamic potentials, and a set of identities to renormalize
non-perturbatively the energy-momentum tensor. At fixed bare parameters the
shifted boundary conditions also provide a simple method to vary the
temperature in much smaller steps than with the standard procedure.

entropy subject to the conservation of energy. A consequence is Landauer's
erasure principle, which states that the erasure of 1 bit of information
requires a minimum energy cost equal to $kT\ln(2)$ where $T$ is the temperature
of a thermal reservoir used in the process and $k$ is Boltzmann's constant.
Jaynes, however, argued that the maximum entropy principle could be applied to
any number of conserved quantities which would suggest that information erasure
may have alternative costs. Indeed we showed recently that by using a reservoir
comprising energy degenerate spins and subject to conservation of angular
momentum, the cost of information erasure is in terms of angular momentum
rather than energy. Here we extend this analysis and derive the minimum cost of
information erasure for systems where different conservation laws operate. We
find that, for each conserved quantity, the minimum resource needed to erase 1
bit of memory is $\lambda^{-1}\ln(2)$ where $\lambda$ is related to the average
value of the conserved quantity. The costs of erasure depend, fundamentally, on
both the nature of the physical memory element and the reservoir with which it
is coupled.

immediately the possibility that resonances may also be present in the
parameter region characteristic of the standard model Higgs sector. This

the context of maximizing the energy-efficiency (EE) of a multi-user,
multi-relay orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) cellular
network, where the objective function is formulated as the ratio of the
spectral-efficiency (SE) over the total power dissipation. It is proven that
the fractional programming problem considered is quasi-concave so that
Dinkelbach's method may be employed for finding the optimal solution at a low
complexity. This method solves the above-mentioned master problem by solving a
series of parameterized concave secondary problems. These secondary problems
are solved using a dual decomposition approach, where each secondary problem is
further decomposed into a number of similar subproblems. The impact of various
system parameters on the attainable EE and SE of the system employing both EE
maximization (EEM) and SE maximization (SEM) algorithms is characterized. In
particular, it is observed that increasing the number of relays for a range of
cell sizes, although marginally increases the attainable SE, reduces the EE
significantly. It is noted that the highest SE and EE are achieved, when the
relays are placed closer to the BS to take advantage of the resultant
line-of-sight link. Furthermore, increasing both the number of available
subcarriers and the number of active user equipment (UE) increases both the EE
and the total SE of the system as a benefit of the increased frequency and
multi-user diversity, respectively. Finally, it is demonstrated that as
expected, increasing the available power tends to improve the SE, when using
the SEM algorithm. By contrast, given a sufficiently high available power, the
EEM algorithm attains the maximum achievable EE and a suboptimal SE.

a maximum flow in $O(mn)$ time on sparse networks where $m = O(n)$. To our
knowledge, this is the first $O(mn)$ time push-relabel algorithm for the $m =

could find a max-flow in $O(mn)$ time when $m = \Omega(n^{1+\epsilon})$ (King,

algorithm due to Orlin (STOC `13), which finds a max-flow in $O(mn)$ time on
sparse networks.
  Our main result is improving on the Excess-Scaling algorithm (Ahuja & Orlin,
1989) by reducing the number of nonsaturating pushes to $O(mn)$ across all
scaling phases. This is reached by combining Ahuja and Orlin's algorithm with
Orlin's compact flow networks. A contribution of this paper is demonstrating
that the compact networks technique can be extended to the push-relabel family

avenue towards an $O(mn)$-time algorithm for all edge densities.

dynamics of two electrons in a double quantum dot subject to hyperfine
interaction with nuclear spins and spin-orbit coupling. The nuclear subsystem
dynamically evolves in response to Landau-Zener singlet-triplet transitions of
the electronic subsystem controlled by external gate voltages. Without noise
and spin-orbit coupling, subsequent Landau-Zener transitions die out after
about $10^4$ sweeps, the system self-quenches, and nuclear spins reach one of
the numerous glassy dark states. We present an analytical model that captures
this phenomenon. We also account for the multi-nuclear-specie content of the
dots and numerically determine the evolution of around $10^7$ nuclear spins in
up to $2\times10^5$ Landau-Zener transitions. Without spin-orbit coupling,
self-quenching is robust and sets in for arbitrary ratios of the nuclear spin
precession times and the waiting time between Landau-Zener sweeps as well as
under moderate noise. In presence of spin-orbit coupling of a moderate
magnitude, and when the waiting time is in resonance with the precession time
of one of the nuclear species, the dynamical evolution of nuclear polarization
results in stroboscopic screening of spin-orbit coupling. However, small
deviations from the resonance or strong spin-orbit coupling destroy this
screening. We suggest that the success of the feedback loop technique for
building nuclear gradients is based on the effect of spin-orbit coupling.

time, outward speed, are obtained. Further, automated emission measure analysis
is exploited to determine estimates for the temperature and density of the jet.
A propagating transverse wave supported by the jet spire is also observed.
Measurement of the wave properties are exploited for magneto-seismology and are
used in conjunction with the emission measure results to estimate the magnetic
field strength of the jet. We present a detailed description of the jet's
evolution, with new evidence for plasma flows, prior to the jet's initiation,
along the loops at the base of the jet and also find further evidence that
flows along the jet spire consist of multiple, quasi-periodic small-scale
plasma ejection events. In addition, DEM analysis suggests that the jet has
temperatures of $\log{5.89\pm0.08}$ K and electron densities of
$\log{8.75\pm0.05}$ cm$^{-3}$. Measured properties of the transverse wave
suggest the wave is heavily damped as it propagates along the jet spire with

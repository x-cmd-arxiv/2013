star-forming cores and 8 star-forming regions from the TADPOL survey. We show
maps of all sources, and compare the ~2.5"" resolution TADPOL maps with ~20""
resolution polarization maps from single-dish submillimeter telescopes. Here we
do not attempt to interpret the detailed B-field morphology of each object.
Rather, we use average B-field orientations to derive conclusions in a
statistical sense from the ensemble of sources, bearing in mind that these
average orientations can be quite uncertain. We discuss three main findings:
(1) A subset of the sources have consistent magnetic field (B-field)
orientations between large (~20"") and small (~2.5"") scales. Those same sources
also tend to have higher fractional polarizations than the sources with
inconsistent large-to-small-scale fields. We interpret this to mean that in at
least some cases B-fields play a role in regulating the infall of material all
the way down to the ~1000 AU scales of protostellar envelopes. (2) Outflows
appear to be randomly aligned with B-fields; although, in sources with low
polarization fractions there is a hint that outflows are preferentially
perpendicular to small-scale B-fields, which suggests that in these sources the
fields have been wrapped up by envelope rotation. (3) Finally, even at ~2.5""
resolution we see the so-called ""polarization hole"" effect, where the
fractional polarization drops significantly near the total intensity peak. All
data are publicly available in the electronic edition of this article.

large number of consumer electronic devices leading to a surge in their
production. This has made it imperative to employ automatic inspection systems
to identify manufacturing defects in PCB before they are installed in the
respective systems. An important task in this regard is the classification of
defects as either true or pseudo defects, which decides if the PCB is to be
re-manufactured or not. This work proposes a novel approach to detect most
common defects in the PCBs. The problem has been approached by employing highly
discriminative features based on multi-scale wavelet transform, which are
further boosted by using a kernalized version of the support vector machines
(SVM). A real world printed circuit board dataset has been used for
quantitative analysis. Experimental results demonstrated the efficacy of the
proposed method.

observation of continuum radiation. As, quantum mechanically, the radiation is
a mixture of pure states, it should be possible to measure the temporal
coherence of the states as a function of energy. We propose here experiments
with just this possibility, showing the empirical grounds on which it is based.
A simple means of measuring temporal coherence is with the extent of the
interference pattern produced in a Young's double-slit experiment. Thus, we
propose the use of such an experiment, but with a screen of energy measuring
photon detectors, small enough and sensitive enough to delineate the
interference patterns according to photon energy. We then only register a
detection if the absorbed photon is found to have the energy of interest. In
this way, we have allowed the interference, i.e., the wave aspect of the
experiment, to proceed as normal, recovering the interference pattern by
accumulating just those registered detections. We, also, explain why this form
of filtering does not actually violate the conventional wisdom that, when using
an optical filter with incident continuum radiation to separate out the photons
of a particular energy, only the temporal coherence of the filter's passband
would be measured. It naturally then introduces the concept of a detections
filter, differentiating it from an optical filter.

using this universal coupling we study the post-Newtonian approximations and
obtain the parameterized post-Newtonian (PPN) parameters in terms of the

two PPN parameters were calculated, we obtain {\it all} PPN parameters. We

the solar system tests impose no constraint on the parameter $\lambda$
appearing in the kinetic part of the action. As a result, the solar system
tests, when combined with the condition for avoidance of strong coupling, do
not lead to an upper bound on the energy scale $M_{*}$ that suppresses higher
dimensional operators in the theory. This is in sharp contrast to other

second-order statistics in massive MIMO multi-cell networks. We consider both
the cases of co-located massive arrays and large-scale distributed antenna
settings. We are interested in characterizing the low-rankness of users'
channel covariance matrices, as such a property can be exploited towards
improved channel estimation (so-called pilot decontamination) as well as
interference rejection via spatial filtering. In previous work, it was shown
that massive MIMO channel covariance matrices exhibit a useful finite rank
property that can be modeled via the angular spread of multipath at a MIMO
uniform linear array. This paper extends this result to more general settings
including certain non-uniform arrays, and more surprisingly, to two dimensional
distributed large scale arrays. In particular our model exhibits the dependence
of the signal subspace's richness on the scattering radius around the user
terminal, through a closed form expression. The applications of the
low-rankness covariance property to channel estimation's denoising and
low-complexity interference filtering are highlighted.

to near Earth in multi-viewpoint imaging data from STEREO SECCHI and SOHO
LASCO. We use the Graduate Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model to estimate the
three-dimensional direction and height of the CMEs in every image out to
$\sim$200 R$_\odot$. We fit the derived three-dimensional (deprojected) height

50$R_\odot$ gives the best ToA with a total error $\pm$13 hours. For seven
(78%) of the CMEs, we are able to predict the ToA to within $\pm$6 hours. These
results are a full day improvement over past CME arrival time methods that only
used SOHO LASCO data. We conclude that heliographic measurements, beyond the

differential-integral equation in a ball coupled by a third-order elliptic

developed in some previous literature, we prove that there exists a null

which passes through a given set of subvarieties. Using tropical geometry, we
associate a subset of $\Delta$ to each of these subvarieties. We prove that a
weighted sum of the volumes of these subsets estimates the volume of $\Delta$
from below.
  As a particular application of our method we consider a planar algebraic
curve $C$ which passes through generic points $p_1,\dots,p_n$ with prescribed
multiplicities $m_1,\dots,m_n$. Suppose that the minimal lattice width
$\omega(\Delta)$ of the Newton polygon $\Delta$ of the curve $C$ is at least
$\max(m_i)$. Using tropical floor diagrams (a certain degeneration of
$p_1,\dots, p_n$ on a horizontal line) we prove that
$$\mathrm{area}(\Delta)\geq \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^n m_i^2-S,\ \ \text{where }
S=\frac{1}{2}\max \left(\sum_{i=1}^n s_i^2 \Big| s_i\leq m_i, \sum_{i=1}^n
s_i\leq \omega(\Delta)\right).$$
  In the case $m_1=m_2=\ldots =m\leq \omega(\Delta)$ this estimate becomes
$\mathrm{area}(\Delta)\geq \frac{1}{2}(n-\frac{\omega(\Delta)}{m})m^2$. That
rewrites as $d\geq (\sqrt{n}-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2\sqrt n})m$ for the curves
of degree $d$.
  We consider an arbitrary toric surface (i.e. arbitrary $\Delta$) and our
ground field is an infinite field of any characteristic, or a finite field
large enough. The latter constraint arises because it is not {\it \`a priori}
clear what is {\it a collection of generic points} in the case of a small
finite field. We construct such collections for fields big enough, and that may
be also interesting for the coding theory.

establish a Kuratowski-like theorem that under mild hypotheses, any two such
spaces of size $>\kappa$ are isomorphic by a $\kappa$-Borel function. We then
consider a dynamic version of the Choquet game and show that in this case the
existence of a winning strategy for player II implies the existence of a
winning tactic, that is, a strategy that depends only on the most recent move.

ultrametric is allowed to take values in a set of size $\kappa$. We show that

equivalence, with the ultimate goal of gaining insight into universality for
three-nucleon forces. With sufficient running of the SRG flow equations, the
low-energy matrix elements of different realistic potentials evolve to a
universal form. Because these potentials are fit to low-energy data, they are
(approximately) phase equivalent only up to a certain energy, and we find
universality in evolved potentials up to the corresponding momentum. More
generally we find universality in local energy regions, reflecting a local
decoupling by the SRG. The further requirements for universality in evolved
potential matrix elements are explored using two simple alternative potentials.
We see evidence that in addition to predicting the same observables, common
long-range potentials (i.e., explicit pion physics) is required for
universality in the potential matrix elements after SRG flow. In agreement with
observations made previously for Vlowk evolution, regions of universal
potential matrix elements are restricted to where half-on-shell T-matrix
equivalence holds.

determining the scales of IIB string compactifications after moduli
stabilisation. It has been argued that values of $W_{flux}$ much less than one
are preferred, and even required for physical and consistency reasons. This
note revisits these arguments. We establish that the coupling (g) of heavy
Kaluza-Klein modes to light states scales as ${M_{KK} / M_{Pl}}$ (hence is
suppressed by two third powers of the inverse volume of compactification) and
argue that consistency of the superspace derivative expansion requires $gF/M^2
\sim m_{3/2}/ M_{KK} << 1$, where $F$ is the auxiliary field of the light
fields and $M$ the ultraviolet cutoff. This gives only a mild constraint on the
flux superpotential, $W_{flux} << V^{1/3}$ (where V is the volume of the
compactification), which can be easily satisfied for order one values of
$W_{flux}$. This regime is also statistically favoured and makes the
Bousso-Polchinski mechanism for the vacuum energy hierarchically more
efficient.

Cygni absorption features. The rest-frame UV spectral features are indicative
of a young starburst with high ionization, implying either 1) an ionization
parameter significantly higher than suggest by rest-frame optical nebular
lines, or 2) differences in one or both of the initial mass function and the
properties of ionizing spectra of massive stars. We argue that the observed
features are likely the result of a superposition of star forming regions with
different physical properties. These results demonstrate the complexity of star
formation on scales smaller than individual galaxies, and highlight the
importance of systematic effects that result from smearing together the
signatures of individual star forming regions within galaxies.

heavy-light ion collisions derived in our previous paper on the subject in the
saturation/Color Glass Condensate framework. Concentrating on the energy and
geometry dependence of the corresponding correlation functions we find that the
two-gluon correlator is a much slower function of the center-of-mass energy
than the one- and two-gluon production cross sections. The geometry dependence
of the correlation function leads to stronger azimuthal near- and away-side
correlations in the tip-on-tip U+U collisions than in the side-on-side U+U
collisions, an exactly opposite behavior from the correlations generated by the
elliptic flow of the quark-gluon plasma: a study of azimuthal correlations in
the U+U collisions may thus help to disentangle the two sources of
correlations.
  We demonstrate that the cross section for two-gluon production in heavy-light
ion collisions contains a power-law infrared (IR) divergence even for fixed
produced gluon momenta: while saturation effects in the target regulate some of
the power-law IR-divergent terms in the lowest-order expression for the
two-gluon correlator, other power-law IR-divergent terms remain, possibly due
to absence of saturation effects in the dilute projectile. Finally we rewrite
our result for the two-gluon production cross-section in a $k_T$-factorized
form, obtaining a new factorized expression involving a convolution of one- and
two-gluon Wigner distributions over both the transverse momenta and impact
parameters. We show that the two-gluon production cross-section depends on two
different types of unintegrated two-gluon Wigner distribution functions.

cohomology and the Griffiths period integral of a smooth projective
hypersurface in terms of BV(Batalin-Vilkovisky) algebras and homotopy Lie
theory (so called, $L_\infty$-homotopy theory).
  Let $X_G$ be a smooth projective hypersurface in the complex projective space
$\mathbf{P}^n$ defined by a homogeneous polynomial $G(\underline x)$ of degree
$d \geq 1$. Let $\mathbb{H}=H^{n-1}_{\operatorname{prim}}(X_G, \mathbb{C})$ be
the middle dimensional primitive cohomology of $X_G$. We explicitly construct a
BV algebra $\mathbf{B\!\!V}_{\! \!X}=(\mathcal{A}_X,Q_X, K_X)$ such that its
$0$-th cohomology $H^0_{K_X}(\mathcal{A}_X)$ is canonically isomorphic to
$\mathbb{H}$. We also equip $\mathbf{B\!\!V}_{\! \!X}$ with a decreasing
filtration and a bilinear pairing which realize the Hodge filtration and the
cup product polarization on $\mathbb{H}$ under the canonical isomorphism.
Moreover, we lift $C_{[\gamma]}:\mathbb{H} \to \mathbb{C}$ to a cochain map
$\mathcal{C}_\gamma:(\mathcal{A}_X, K_X) \to (\mathbb{C},0)$, where
$C_{[\gamma]}$ is the Griffiths period integral given by $\omega \mapsto
\int_\gamma \omega$ for $[\gamma]\in H_{n-1}(X_G,\mathbb{Z})$.
  We use this enhanced homotopy structure on $\mathbb{H}$ to study an extended
formal deformation of $X_G$ and the correlation of its period integrals. If
$X_G$ is in a formal family of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces $X_{G_{\underline T}}$,
we provide an explicit formula and algorithm (based on a Gr\""obner basis) to
compute the period matrix of $X_{G_{\underline T}}$ in terms of the period
matrix of $X_G$ and an $L_\infty$-morphism $\underline \kappa$ which enhances
$C_{[\gamma]}$ and governs deformations of period matrices.

that any single beamsplitter that nontrivially mixes two modes, also densely
generates the set of unitary transformations (or orthogonal transformations, in
the real case) on the single-photon subspace with m>=3 modes. (We prove the
same result for any two-mode real optical gate, and for any two-mode optical
gate combined with a generic phaseshifter.) Experimentally, this means that one
does not need tunable beamsplitters or phaseshifters for universality: any
nontrivial beamsplitter is universal for linear optics. Theoretically, it means
that one cannot produce ""intermediate"" models of linear optical computation
(analogous to the Clifford group for qubits) by restricting the allowed
beamsplitters and phaseshifters: there is a dichotomy; one either gets a
trivial set or else a universal set. No similar classification theorem for
gates acting on qubits is currently known. We leave open the problem of
classifying optical gates that act on three or more modes.

propose a reconstruction method that uses narrowband waveforms along with two

direction, which forms the two distinct dimensions required for the
reconstruction. The Reconstruction technique uses inverse Fourier transform
along with amplitude and phase correction factors. In addition, this
reconstruction technique does not require interpolation of the data in either
wavenumber or spatial domain. Use of the two dimensional beam steering offers
better performance in the presence of noise compared with the existing methods,

to phase noise, are analyzed.

binary mixture composed by polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) at $M_w = 55900$ g/mol
with 3- octanone. This binary mixture which has a demixing transition with an
upper critical solution temperature $T_c$ has indeed interesting properties
which may be useful for several application : a) its correlation length is
larger than that of a liquid-liquid binary mixture, b) it is less viscous than
a polymer blend; c) 3- octanone has an evaporation rate much smaller than other
solvents. The mixture is first characterized by turbidity, to get the demixing
temperature for different volumic fraction of PMMA. The coordinates of the
critical point are obtained: $\phi_c = 12.8\pm0.2$ % and $T_c = 306.5\pm0.1$ K.
The correlation length $\xi$ near the critical point is then measured in a
solution with a 12.8% volumic fraction of PMMA using static light scattering.
Using the fact that PMMA-octanone mixture has scaling exponents compatible with
Ising 3D, we determine more precisely the critical temperature $T_c =
306.58\pm0.04$ K and we find that $\xi \simeq \xi_0 [(T-T_c)/{T_c}]^{-0.63}$
with $\xi_0 = 0.97\pm 0.02$ nm. The discrepancy between this value and that
extrapolated from other measurements based on turbidity is discussed.

optimizing the intrinsic properties associated with the superfluid density in
the A15 phase (e.g. Tc, Hc, Hc2, all of which are composition dependent),
maximizing the quantity of A15 that can be formed from a given mixture of Nb,
Sn and Cu, minimizing the A15 composition gradients within each sub-element,
while at the same time generating a high vortex pinning critical current
density, Jc, by maximizing the grain boundary density with the additional
constraint of maintaining the RRR of the Cu stabilizer above 100. Here we study
these factors in a Ta-alloyed Restacked-Rod-Process (RRP) wire with ~70 microns
diameter sub-elements. Consistent with many earlier studies, maximum non-Cu
Jc(12T,4.2K) requires preventing A15 grain growth, rather than by optimizing
the superfluid density. In wires optimized for 12T, 4.2K performance, about 60%
of the non-Cu cross-section is A15, 35% residual Cu and Sn core, and only 5% a
residual Nb7.5wt.%Ta diffusion barrier. The specific heat and chemical analyses
show that in this 60% A15 fraction there is a wide range of Tc and chemical
composition that does diminish for higher heat treatment temperatures, which,
however, are impractical because of the strong RRR degradation that occurs when
only about 2% of the A15 reaction front breaches the diffusion barrier. As this
kind of Nb3Sn conductor design is being developed for sub-elements 1/2 the
present size, it is clear that better barriers are essential to allowing higher
temperature reactions with better intrinsic A15 properties. We present here
multiple and detailed intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations because we believe
that only such broad and quantitative descriptions are capable of accurately
tracking the limitations of individual conductor designs where optimization
will always be a compromise between inherently conflicting goals

the stepping process, which is intimately connected to its biological function.
The best understood of these is hand-over-hand stepping by a swinging lever arm
movement toward the plus-end of actin filaments, essential to its role as a
cellular transporter. However, single-molecule experiments have also shown that
the motor ""foot stomps"", with one hand detaching and rebinding to the same
site, and backsteps under sufficient load. Explaining the complete taxonomy of
myosin V's load-dependent stepping pathways, and the extent to which these are
constrained by motor structure and mechanochemistry, are still open questions.
Starting from a polymer model, we develop an analytical theory to understand
the minimal physical properties that govern motor dynamics. In particular, we
solve the first-passage problem of the head reaching the target binding site,
investigating the competing effects of load pulling back at the motor, strain
in the leading head that biases the diffusion in the direction of the target,
and the possibility of preferential binding to the forward site due to the
recovery stroke. The theory reproduces a variety of experimental data,
including the power stroke and slow diffusive search regimes in the mean
trajectory of the detached head, and the force dependence of the
forward-to-backward step ratio, run length, and velocity. The analytical
approach yields a formula for the stall force, identifying the relative
contributions of the chemical cycle rates and mechanical features like the
bending rigidities of the lever arms. Most importantly, by fully exploring the
design space of the motor, we predict that myosin V is a robust motor whose
dynamical behavior is not compromised by reasonable perturbations to the
reaction cycle, and changes in the architecture of the lever arm.

magnetic field that is a remnant of the much larger fluxes present in molecular
cloud cores. If this flux is approximately conserved its dynamical importance
will increase as mass is accreted, initially by stimulating magnetorotational
disk turbulence and subsequently by enabling wind angular momentum loss. We use
fits to numerical simulations of ambipolar dominated disk turbulence to
construct simplified one dimensional evolution models for weakly magnetized
protoplanetary disks. We show that the late onset of significant angular
momentum loss in a wind can give rise to ""two timescale"" disk evolution in
which a long phase of viscous evolution precedes rapid dispersal as the wind
becomes dominant. The wide dispersion in disk lifetimes could therefore be due
to varying initial levels of net flux. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind triggered
dispersal differs from photoevaporative dispersal in predicting mass loss from
small (less that 1 AU) scales, where thermal winds are suppressed. Our specific
models are based on a limited set of simulations that remain uncertain, but
qualitatively similar evolution appears likely if mass is lost from disks more
quickly than flux, and if MHD winds become important as the plasma beta

larger class of Conditional Abundance Matching models (CAM), a theoretical
framework we introduce here for the first time. CAM provides a general
formalism to study correlations at fixed mass between any galaxy property and
any halo property. The striking success of our simple implementation of CAM
provides compelling evidence that this technique has the potential to describe
the same set of data as alternative models, but with a dramatic reduction in
the required number of parameters. CAM achieves this reduction by exploiting
the capability of contemporary N-body simulations to determine dark matter halo
properties other than mass alone, which distinguishes our model from
conventional approaches to the galaxy-halo connection.

favour of a constant escape fraction for young stars to keep the calculation

photoionisation feedback through the whole history of a galaxy`s formation. The
simulation of a Milky Way like galaxy using the local photoionisation model
forms ~ 40 % less stars than a simulation that only includes a standard uniform
background UV field. The local photoionisation model decreases star formation
by increasing the cooling time of the gas in the halo and increasing the
equilibrium temperature of dense gas in the disc. Coupling the local radiation
field to gas cooling from the halo provides a preventive feedback mechanism
which keeps the central disc light and produces slowly rising rotation curves
without resorting to extreme feedback mechanisms. These preliminary results
indicate that the effect of local photoionising sources is significant and
should not be ignored in models of galaxy formation.

confirm that JKCS 041 is a rich cluster and derive a redshift z=1.80 via the

These are centered upon diffuse X-ray emission seen by the Chandra observatory.
As JKCS 041 is the most distant known cluster with such a large,
spectroscopically confirmed quiescent population, it provides a unique
opportunity to study the effect of the environment on galaxy properties at
early epochs. We construct high-quality composite spectra of the quiescent
cluster members that reveal prominent Balmer and metallic absorption lines.
Using these, we measure the mean stellar ages in two bins of stellar mass. The
quiescent cluster members' ages agree remarkably closely with that inferred by
Whitaker et al. for similarly selected samples in the field, supporting the
idea that the cluster environment is more efficient at truncating star
formation while not having a strong effect on the mean epoch of quenching. We
find some evidence (90% confidence) for a lower fraction of disk-like quiescent
systems in JKCS 041 compared to a sample of coeval field galaxies drawn from
the CANDELS survey. Taking this into account, we do not detect a significant
difference between the mass-radius relations of the quiescent JKCS 041 members

the study of \emph{adaptive} device-independent protocols. Our primary

$\Lambda$CDM dissipationless cosmological simulations, which must be
non-separable in its radial and tangential components, is still poorly known.
We present the first single-parameter, non-separable, anisotropic model for the
VDF in $\Lambda$CDM halos, built from an isotropic $q$-Gaussian (Tsallis) VDF
of the isotropic set of dimensionless spherical velocity components (after
subtraction of streaming motions), normalized by the respective velocity
dispersions. We test our VDF on 90 cluster-mass halos of a dissipationless
cosmological simulation.
  Beyond the virial radius, $r_{\rm vir}$, our model VDF adequately reproduces
that measured in the simulated halos, but no $q$-Gaussian model can adequately
represent the VDF within $r_{\rm vir}$, as the speed distribution function is
then flatter-topped than any $q$-Gaussian can allow. Nevertheless, our VDF fits
significantly better the simulations than the commonly used Maxwellian
(Gaussian) distribution, at virtually all radii within $5\,r_{\rm vir}$. Within
0.4 (1) $r_{\rm vir}$, the non-Gaussianity index $q$ is (roughly) linearly
related to the slope of the density profile and also to the velocity anisotropy
profile. We provide a parametrization of the modulation of $q$ with radius for
both the median fits and the fit of the stacked halo. At radii of a few percent
of $r_{\rm vir}$, corresponding to the Solar position in the Milky Way, our
best-fit VDF, although fitting better the simulations than the Gaussian one,
overproduces significantly the fraction of high velocity objects, indicating
that one should not blindly use these $q$-Gaussian fits to make predictions on
the direct detection rate of DM particles.

the data in light of the so-called G\""udel-Benz relation (GBR) between magnetic
activity in these bands. Some UCDs have very bright radio emission and faint
X-ray emission compared to what would be expected for rapid rotators, while
others show opposite behavior. We show that UCDs would still be
radio-over-luminous relative to the GBR even if their X-ray emission were at
standard rapid-rotator ""saturation"" levels. Recent results from Zeeman-Doppler
imaging and geodynamo simulations suggest that rapidly-rotating UCDs may harbor
a bistable dynamo that supports either a stronger, axisymmetric magnetic field
or a weaker, non-axisymmetric field. We suggest that the data can be explained
in a scenario in which strong-field objects obey the GBR while weak-field
objects are radio-over-luminous and X-ray-under-luminous, possibly because of a
population of gyrosynchrotron-emitting coronal electrons that is continuously
replenished by low-energy reconnection events.

While X-ray data have suggested that this relationship is strongly violated in
ultracool dwarfs (UCDs; spectral type >M7), the limited number of X-ray
detections has prevented firm conclusions. In this paper, we analyze the X-ray
activity-rotation relation in 38 ultracool dwarfs. Our sample represents the
largest catalog of X-ray active ultracool dwarfs to date, including seven new
and four previously-unpublished Chandra observations presented in a companion
paper. We identify a substantial number of rapidly-rotating UCDs with X-ray
activity extending two orders of magnitude below the expected saturation level
and measure a ""supersaturation""-type anticorrelation between rotation and X-ray
activity. The scatter in UCD X-ray activity at a fixed rotation is ~3 times
larger than that in earlier-type stars. We discuss several mechanisms that have
been proposed to explain the data, including centrifugal stripping of the
corona, and find them to be inconsistent with the observed trends. Instead, we
suggest that an additional parameter correlated with both X-ray activity and
rotation is responsible for the observed effects. Building on the results of
Zeeman-Doppler imaging of UCD magnetic fields and our companion study of
radio/X-ray flux ratios, we argue that this parameter is the magnetic field
topology, and that the large scatter in UCD X-ray fluxes reflects the presence
of two dynamo modes that produce distinct topologies.

cadence and time span of the data, on account of photometric uncertainties in
the range 0.02-0.04 mag. Simulations suggest that success could be achieved if
the photometric uncertainties were of order 0.01 mag. Single-band RM for all

for statistical estimate s of mean lags for large samples of AGN of similar

structure of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, it remains unclear how an
MFR evolves into and forms the multi-component structure of a CME. In this
paper, we perform a comprehensive study of an extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) MFR
eruption on 2013 May 22 by tracking its morphological evolution, studying its
kinematics, and quantifying its thermal property. As EUV brightenings begin,
the MFR starts to rise slowly and shows helical threads winding around an axis.
Meanwhile, cool filamentary materials descend spirally down to the
chromosphere. These features provide direct observational evidence of
intrinsically helical structure of the MFR. Through detailed kinematical
analysis, we find that the MFR evolution experiences two distinct phases: a
slow rise phase and an impulsive acceleration phase. We attribute the first
phase to the magnetic reconnection within the quasi-separatrix-layers
surrounding the MFR, and the much more energetic second phase to the fast
magnetic reconnection underneath the MFR. We suggest that the transition
between these two phases be caused by the torus instability. Moreover, we
identify that the MFR evolves smoothly into the outer corona and appears as a
coherent structure within the white light CME volume. The MFR in the outer
corona was enveloped by bright fronts that originated from plasma pile-up in
front of the expanding MFR. The fronts are also associated with the preceding
sheath region followed the outmost MFR-driven shock.

statistically significant galaxy halo mass measurements over a much wider range

z < 0.8$) than previous weak lensing studies. At redshift $z \sim 0.5$, the
stellar-to-halo mass ratio (SHMR) reaches a maximum of $4.0\pm0.2$ percent as a
function of halo mass at $\sim 10^{12.25} M_{\odot}$. We find, for the first
time from weak lensing alone, evidence for significant evolution in the SHMR:
the peak ratio falls as a function of cosmic time from $4.5 \pm 0.3$ percent at
$z \sim 0.7$ to $3.4 \pm 0.2$ percent at $z \sim 0.3$, and shifts to lower
stellar mass haloes. These evolutionary trends are dominated by red galaxies,
and are consistent with a model in which the stellar mass above which star
formation is quenched ""downsizes"" with cosmic time. In contrast, the SHMR of
blue, star-forming galaxies is well-fit by a power law that does not evolve
with time. This suggests that blue galaxies form stars at a rate that is
balanced with their dark matter accretion in such a way that they evolve along
the SHMR locus. The redshift dependence of the SHMR can be used to constrain
the evolution of the galaxy population over cosmic time.

studying low-energy fluctuations of magnetically ordered states. Here we derive
an effective action for the smooth order-parameter distortions of noncoplanar
magnetic textures [with an SO(3) order parameter, as opposed to the
SO(3)/SO(2)=S^2 of collinear magnets] coupled to itinerant electrons.
Noncoplanar magnetic textures commonly arise in the presence of
electron-mediated long-range spin exchange interactions, giving rise to the
emergence of rich electronic phenomena such as anomalous quantum Hall effect.
We parameterize the smooth order-parameter distortions of such a magnetic
texture by certain non-Abelian fields, and derive the action in terms of these
fields by integrating out the itinerant electrons. As a concrete example, we
perform explicit calculations for a triangular-lattice model with tetrahedral
magnetic ordering. The action encodes the charge and spin quantum-Hall
responses as well as the energetics of twisting the magnetic texture.

For coverage maximization, the required selection bias for each tier is given

In particular, we manipulate interface behavior with colloidal particles in

the flower texture, where the focal hyperbolae diverge radially outward from

appropriately curved interfaces. Finally, we present a model for this system

smoothly within a ""background texture"" of large FCDs and concentric spherical

relation, spanning 0.2 < z < 1, using the topology of large-scale structure as

Minkowski functionals of the density field traced by the WiggleZ Dark Energy
Survey. The Minkowski functionals are a set of statistics which completely
describe the topological nature of each isodensity surface within the field, as
a function of the density value. Given the shape of the underlying matter power
spectrum, measured by fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave Background
radiation, the expected amplitudes of the Minkowski functionals are specified
as an excursion set of a Gaussian random field, with minimal non-Gaussian
corrections for the smoothing scales > 10 Mpc/h considered in this analysis.
The measured amplitudes then determine the cosmic distance D_V(z), which we
obtain with 3-7% accuracies in six independent redshift slices, with the
standard ruler originating in the known curvature of the model power spectrum
at the smoothing scale. We introduce a new method for correcting the
topological statistics for the sparse-sampling of the density field by the
galaxy tracers, and validate our overall methodology using mock catalogues from
N-body simulations. Our distance measurements are consistent with standard
models which describe the cosmic expansion history, and with previous analyses
of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) detected by the WiggleZ Survey, with the
topological results yielding a higher distance precision by a factor of 2.
However, the full redshift-space power-spectrum shape is required to recover
the topological distances, in contrast to the preferred length scale imprinted
by BAOs, which is determined by simpler physics.

effect of the un-physical ``virtual'' horizon included in the spacetime where
only the cosmological constant, mass of black hole, rotation parameter and
Maxwell field exist. When there is more extra matter field in the spacetime,
one will find the ``entropy sum'' is also dependent of the strength of these
extra matter field. For both cases, we conclude that the ``entropy sum'' does
not depend on the conserved charges $M$, $Q$ and $J$, while it does depend on
the property of background spacetime. We will mainly test the ``entropy sum''
relation in static, stationary black hole and some black hole with extra matter
source (scalar hair and higher curvature) in the asymptotical (anti-)de-sitter
spacetime background. Besides, we point out a newly found counter example of
the mass independence of the ''entropy product'' relation in the spacetime with
extra scalar hair case, while the ``entropy sum'' relation still holds. These
result are indeed suggestive to some underlying microscopic mechanism.
Moreover, the cosmological constant and extra matter field dependence of the
``entropy sum'' of all horizon seems to reveal that ``entropy sum'' is more
general as it is only related to the background field. For the case of
asymptotical flat spacetime without any matter source, we give a note for the
Kerr black hole case in appendix. One will find only mass dependence of
``entropy sum'' appears. It makes us believe that, considering the dependence
of ``entropy sum'', the mass background field may be regarded as the next order
of cosmological constant background field and extra matter field.

of the displacement field, a change in the deformation mechanism inside the STZ
from shear to tension, a reduction in the stress needed to nucleate the first
STZ, and finally a notable loss in characteristic quadrupolar symmetry of the
surrounding elastic matrix that has previously been seen in athermal,

data in nonvolatile memories. Error-correcting codes are essential for rank
modulation, however, existing results have been limited. In this work we
explore a new approach, \emph{systematic error-correcting codes for rank
modulation}. Systematic codes have the benefits of enabling efficient
information retrieval and potentially supporting more efficient encoding and
decoding procedures. We study systematic codes for rank modulation under
Kendall's $\tau$-metric as well as under the $\ell_\infty$-metric.
  In Kendall's $\tau$-metric we present $[k+2,k,3]$-systematic codes for
correcting one error, which have optimal rates, unless systematic perfect codes
exist. We also study the design of multi-error-correcting codes, and provide
two explicit constructions, one resulting in $[n+1,k+1,2t+2]$ systematic codes
with redundancy at most $2t+1$. We use non-constructive arguments to show the
existence of $[n,k,n-k]$-systematic codes for general parameters. Furthermore,
we prove that for rank modulation, systematic codes achieve the same capacity
as general error-correcting codes.
  Finally, in the $\ell_\infty$-metric we construct two $[n,k,d]$ systematic
multi-error-correcting codes, the first for the case of $d=O(1)$, and the
second for $d=\Theta(n)$. In the latter case, the codes have the same

derivation results in a simple relation between the change in the distribution
and its variance. By applying this relation to several experimental results, in
which the meter involved the time and frequency domains, it is shown to be
especially suitable for scenarios of that kind. The practical and conceptual
implications of a measurement method, which is based on this relation, are
discussed.

oscillations in the post flaring loops of the corona of Proxima Centauri using
XMM-Newton observations. We find the signature of periodic oscillations
localized in the decay phase of the flare in its soft (0.3-10.0 keV) X-ray
emissions. Using the standard wavelet tool, we find the multiple periodicities
of 1261 s and 687 s. These bursty oscillations persist for durations of 90
minutes and 50 minutes, respectively, for more than 4 cycles. The intensity
oscillations with the period of 1261 s may be the signature of the fundamental
mode of slow magnetoacoustic waves with the phase-speed of 119 km s$^{-1}$ in
the loop of the length 7.5$\times 10^{9}$ cm heated initially to obtain the
flare peak temperature of 33 MK and later cooled down in the decay phase
maintained at the average temperature of 7.2 MK. The other period of 687 s may
be associated with the first overtone of slow magnetoacoustic oscillations in
the flaring loop. The fundamental mode oscillations show a dissipation with
damping time of 47 min. The period ratio P$_{1}$/P$_{2}$ is found to be 1.83
indicating that such oscillations are most likely excited in longitudinal
density stratified stellar loops. We estimate the density scale height of
stellar loop system as 22.6 Mm, which is smaller than the hydrostatic scale
height of the hot loop system, and implies the existence of non-equilibrium
conditions.

$CdS$ nano-cylinder from the end of a nano-channel. Furthermore, the cylinder
had a pore along the axis but were closed at one end. This unique phenomenon of
self assembly of {\em monodisperse} CdS nano-cylinders had been observed in a
rather simple experiment where two chambers containing 0.1 M ${\rm Cd Cl_2}$

aluminium oxide (AAO) nano-channels [A. Varghese, S. Datta, Phys. Rev. E., {\bf

growth of a single nano-tube at the exit point of a single AAO-nano-channel. In
this communication, we identify factors affecting the self-assembly process for
nano-tubes growing out an array of closely spaced AAO nano-channel exits. Our
model is not $Cd^{+2}$ or $S^{2-}$ specific, the experimental scheme can be
extended to self assemble a general class of reacting-diffusing A and B ions
with A (${\rm Cd^{+2}}$) selectively migrating out from a nano-channel. In
particular, we note that after the initial prolonged growth of nanotubes, there
can arise a severe deficiency of B-ions (${\rm S^{-2}}$) ions near the
AAO-nano-channel exits, the points where the reaction and aggregation occurs to
form the $CdS$ nanotube, thus impeding further growth of uniform CdS
nano-tubes. Thereby we predict the necessary characteristics of reacting
systems which can be self assembled using suitable adaptations of previous
experiments.

checking from finite-state to infinite-state transition systems, expressed over
some background theories. The procedure is based on a tight integration of IC3
with Implicit (predicate) Abstraction, a technique that expresses abstract
tran- sitions without computing explicitly the abstract system and is
incremental with respect to the addition of predicates. In this scenario, IC3
operates only at the Boolean level of the abstract state space, discovering
inductive clauses over the abstraction predicates. Theory reasoning is confined
within the underlying SMT solver, and applied transparently when performing
satisfiability checks. When the current abstraction allows for a spurious
counterexample, it is refined by discov- ering and adding a sufficient set of
new predicates. Importantly, this can be done in a completely incremental
manner, without discarding the clauses found in the previous search. The
proposed approach has two key advantages. First, unlike current SMT gener-
alizations of IC3, it allows to handle a wide range of background theories
without relying on ad-hoc extensions, such as quantifier elimination or
theory-specific clause generalization procedures, which might not always be
available, and can moreover be inefficient. Second, compared to a direct
exploration of the concrete transition system, the use of abstraction gives a
significant performance improve- ment, as our experiments demonstrate.

circumvent the issue arising from the truncated nature of the available fields,
we combined two modelization methods. In the first step, we applied a filter on
the magnetic field to isolate its large scales by reducing the energy contained
in its small scales, we then derived the dynamical equation, referred as
filtered frozen flux equation, describing the spatio-temporal evolution of the
filtered part of the field. In the second step, we proposed a statistical
parametrization of the filtered magnetic field in order to account for both its
remaining unresolved scales and its large scale uncertainties. These two
modelization techniques were then included in the Bayesian formulation of the
inverse problem. To explore the complex posterior distribution of the velocity
field resulting from this development, we numerically implemented an algorithm

distributed in between 50 and 100 nm and are characterized by an axial banding
pattern with a period of 67 nm. The constituent long molecules of those
fibrils, the so-called triple helices, are densely packed but their nature is
such that their assembly must conciliate two conflicting requirements : a
double-twist around the axis of the fibril induced by their chirality and a
periodic layered organization, corresponding to the axial banding, built by
specific lateral interactions. We examine here how such a conflict could
contribute to the control of the radius of a fibril. We develop our analysis
with the help of two geometrical archetypes : the Hopf fibration and the
algorithm of phyllotaxis. The first one provides an ideal template for a
twisted bundle of fibres and the second ensures the best homogeneity and local
isotropy possible for a twisted dense packing with circular symmetry. This
approach shows that, as the radius of a fibril with constant double-twist
increases, the periodic layered organization can not be preserved without
moving from planar to helicoidal configurations. Such changes of configurations
are indeed made possible by the edge dislocations naturally present in the
phyllotactic pattern where their distribution is such that the lateral growth
of a fibril should stay limited in the observed range. Because of our limited
knowledge about the elastic constants involved, this purely geometrical
development stays at a quite conjectural level.

vanishing of the invariants is equivalent to the existence of a totally
geodesic paraconformal structure which consist of a paraconformal structure, an
adapted $GL(2,\R)$-connection and a two-parameter family of totally geodesic
hypersurfaces on the solution space. The structures coincide with the
projective structures in dimension 2 and with the Einstein-Weyl structures of
Lorentzian signature in dimension 3. We show that the totally geodesic

actions, describing the dynamics of quantum fields at different energy scales.
The consequent natural idea of a space of theories is still a rather imprecise
notion, since a detailed knowledge or a classification of QFTs is out of reach.
In two dimensions the situation is in a better shape: in this context CFTs are
under control in many instances, and we know sequences of rational theories
emerging as end-points of RG flows. The present thesis explores the behaviour
of sequences of rational two-dimensional CFTs when the central charge
approaches its supremum. After a review of various notions useful to study
limit theories, like the concept of averaged fields and the construction of
continuous orbifolds, we analyse in detail the limit of sequences of N=2
supersymmetric CFTs that are connected by RG flows. The limit is not unique,
since with extended Virasoro symmetry one can choose different scalings for the
labels of the spectrum in the limit. We construct explicitly two c=3 CFTs
emerging as the large level limit of minimal models, and we identify both of
them: one is the N=2 CFT of two uncompactified free real bosons and two free
real fermions, the other is its continuous orbifold by U(1). We compare
spectrum, torus partition function, correlators and boundary conditions. The
neatest interpretation of this result is given by studying the realisation of
N=2 minimal models as gauged WZW models: taking the two different limits
amounts to zooming into two different regions of the target-space geometry. At
the end we speculate about possible extensions and generalisations.

s-process elements. They form a significant proportion of the very metal-poor
stars in the Galactic halo and are mostly observed in binary systems. This
suggests that the observed chemical anomalies are due to mass accretion in the
past from an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star. Because CEMP-s stars have
hardly evolved since their formation, the study of their observed abundances
provides a way to probe our models of AGB nucleosynthesis at low metallicity.
To this end we included in our binary evolution model the results of the latest
models of AGB nucleosynthesis and we simulated a grid of 100,000 binary stars
at metallicity Z=0.0001 in a wide range of initial masses and separations. We
compared our modelled stars with a sample of 60 CEMP-s stars from the SAGA
database of metal-poor stars. For each observed CEMP-s star of the sample we
found the modelled star that reproduces best the observed abundances. The
result of this comparison is that we are able to reproduce simultaneously the
observed abundance of the elements affected by AGB nucleosynthesis (e.g. C, Mg,
s-elements) for about 60% of the stars in the sample.

parameters to constrain the star formation history of galaxies. However, HII
regions associated with recent star-formation may not have abundances typical
for the galaxy as a whole and it is believed that the bulk of the metals may be
contained in the neutral gas. It is therefore important to directly probe the
metal abundances in the neutral gas, which can be done by using absorption
lines imprinted on a background quasar. Recently, we have presented studies of
the stellar content of a small sample of such quasar absorbers with HI column
densities measured to be in the sub-Damped Lyman-alpha to Damped Lyman-alpha
range. Here, we present observations covering 300 nm to 2.5 microns of emission
line spectra of three of these absorbing-galaxies using the long-slit
spectrograph X-Shooter on the VLT. This allows us to compare the neutral and
ionised phase metallicities in the same objects and relates these measures to
possible signature of low-metallicity gas accretion or outflows of gas enriched
by star formation. Our results suggest that the abundances derived in
absorption along the line-of-sight to background quasars are reliable measures
of the overall galaxy metallicities. In addition to a comparison of abundances
in different phases of the gas, a potential observational consequence of
differences in fueling mechanisms for disc galaxies is the internal
distribution of their chemical abundances. We present some evidence for small
negative metallicity gradients in the three systems. The flat slopes are in
line with the differences observed between the two phases of the gas. These
results suggest that a comparison of the HI and HII metallicities is a robust
indicator of abundance gradients in high-redshift galaxies and do not favour
the presence of infall of fresh gas in these objects.

financial network model that combines the default and liquidity stress
mechanisms into a ""double cascade mapping"". The progress and eventual result of
the crisis is obtained by iterating this mapping to its fixed point. Unlike
simpler models, this model can therefore quantify how illiquidity or default of
one bank influences the overall level of liquidity stress and default in the
system. Large-network asymptotic cascade mapping formulas are derived that can
be used for efficient network computations of the double cascade. Numerical
experiments then demonstrate that these asymptotic formulas agree qualitatively
with Monte Carlo results for large finite networks, and quantitatively except
when the initial system is placed in an exceptional ""knife-edge"" configuration.
The experiments clearly support the main conclusion that when banks respond to
liquidity stress by hoarding liquidity, then in the absence of asset fire
sales, the level of defaults in a financial network is negatively related to
the strength of bank liquidity hoarding and the eventual level of stress in the
network.

blankets of a nuclear fusion reactor would generate tritium which is to be
extracted and recirculated as fuel. At the same time that tritium is bred,
helium is also generated and may precipitate in the form of nano bubbles. Other
liquid metal systems of a nuclear reactor involve hydrogen isotope absorption
processes, e.g., tritium extraction system. Hence, hydrogen isotope absorption
into gas bubbles modelling and control may have a capital importance regarding
design, operation and safety.
  Here general models for hydrogen isotopes transport in liquid metal and
absorption into gas phase, that do not depend on the mass transfer limiting
regime, are exposed and implemented in OpenFOAMR CFD tool for 0D to 3D
simulations. Results for a 0D case show the impact of a He dispersed phase of
nano bubbles on hydrogen isotopes inventory at different temperatures as well
as the inventory evolution during a He nucleation event. In addition, 1D and 2D
axisymmetric cases are exposed showing the effect of a He dispersed gas phase
on hydrogen isotope permeation through a lithium lead eutectic alloy and the
effect of vortical structures on hydrogen isotope transport at a backward
facing step. Exposed results give a valuable insight on current nuclear
technology regarding the importance of controlling hydrogen isotope transport
and its interactions with nucleation event through gas absorption processes.

  A model based on the self-consistent nucleation theory (SCT) with a surface

surface parameterization where a parametric representation is worked out only
for the boundary of a 3D model (which is a surface). Volumetric
parameterization is typically helpful in solving complicated geometric problems
pertaining to shape matching, morphing, path planning of robots, and
isogeometric analysis etc. A novel method is proposed in which a volume
parameterization is developed by mapping a general non-convex (genus-0) domain
to its topologically equivalent convex domain. In order to achieve a continuous
and bijective mapping of a domain, first we use the harmonic function to
establish a potential field over the domain. The gradients of the potential
values are used to track the streamlines which originate from the boundary and
converge to a single point, referred to as the shape center. Each streamline
approaches the shape center at a unique polar angle and an azimuthal angle .
Once all the three parameters (potential value, polar angle, azimuthal angle)
necessary to represent any point in the given domain are available, the domain
is said to be parameterized. Using our method, given a 3D non-convex domain, we
can parameterize the surface as well as the interior of the domain. The
proposed method is implemented and the algorithm is tested on many standard
cases to demonstrate the effectiveness.

not gravitationally bound. We note several possible explanations for the
proximities and similar radial velocities of the satellites in each pair, for

{\em covering}. The problem of splitting multiple coverings into several
coverings was motivated by classical density estimates for {\em sphere

prevailing conjecture for 35 years (settled in many special cases) that for
every plane convex body $C$, there exists a constant $m=m(C)$ such that every
$m$-fold covering of the plane with translates of $C$ splits into $2$
coverings. In the present paper, it is proved that this conjecture is false for
the unit disk. The proof can be generalized to construct, for every $m$, an
unsplittable $m$-fold covering of the plane with translates of any open convex
body $C$ which has a smooth boundary with everywhere {\em positive curvature}.
Somewhat surprisingly, {\em unbounded} open convex sets $C$ do not misbehave,
they satisfy the conjecture: every $3$-fold covering of any region of the plane
by translates of such a set $C$ splits into two coverings. To establish this
result, we prove a general coloring theorem for hypergraphs of a special type:
{\em shift-chains}. We also show that there is a constant $c>0$ such that, for

radial velocity (RV) presents sinusoidal variations with a period of about 590
d, which have been stable for more than 25 years. Using ESPaDOnS and Narval we
have detected a weak (sub-gauss) magnetic field at the surface of Pollux and
followed up its variations with Narval during 4.25 years, i.e. more than for
two periods of the RV variations. The longitudinal magnetic field is found to
vary with a sinusoidal behaviour with a period close to that of the RV
variations and with a small shift in phase. We then performed a Zeeman Doppler
imaging (ZDI) investigation from the Stokes V and Stokes I least-squares
deconvolution (LSD) profiles. A rotational period is determined, which is
consistent with the period of variations of the RV. The magnetic topology is
found to be mainly poloidal and this component almost purely dipolar. The mean
strength of the surface magnetic field is about 0.7 G. As an alternative to the
scenario in which Pollux hosts a close-in exoplanet, we suggest that the
magnetic dipole of Pollux can be associated with two temperature and
macroturbulent velocity spots which could be sufficient to produce the RV
variations. We finally investigate the scenarii of the origin of the magnetic
field which could explain the observed properties of Pollux.

appropriate way, depending on the measurement outcome. If the extracted work is
$W_1$ and the work $W_{\text{er}}$ needed to be dissipated in order to erase

how accurately the energy should be measured. By increasing the accuracy one
can extract more work, but at the same time one obtains more information that
has to be deleted. We discuss what are the appropriate ways of optimizing the
balance between the two and find optimal solutions. Second, whenever $W_1$ is

of isotropic inflationary solution with background magnetic field is shown,
which generalizes the known results for U(1) gauge fields. We also study
anisotropic inflationary solutions, all of which turn out to be unstable. Then
nonlinear stability for the isotropic inflationary solution is examined by
numerically investigating the dependence of the late-time behaviour on the
initial conditions. We present a number of novel features that may well affect
physical predictions and viability of the models. First, in the absence of
spatial curvature, strong initial anisotropy leads to a rapid oscillation of
gauge field, thwarting convergence to the inflationary attractor. Secondly, the
inclusion of spatial curvature destabilizes the oscillatory attractor and the
global stability of the isotropic inflation with gauge field is restored.
Finally, based on the numerical evidence combined with the knowledge of the
eigenvalues for various inflationary solutions, we give a generic lower-bound

systematically discussed in theory. By employing the phase transition theory
and non-equilibrium transport theory, the spallation processes of ductile
metals under dynamic loading may be mainly determined by the diffusion and
agglomeration of generated vacancies. And through the theoretical analysis on
the dynamic spallation processes, it is found that (1)the spallation critical
behaviors exist; (2)both the damage evolution rate and the void growth velocity
in the spallation planes are monitored by the grain sizes, the tensile strain
rate and the temperature of the metal after shocking, i.e., a larger grain size
and tensile strain rate and higher temperature will cause a larger damage
evolution rate and void growth velocity; (3)there exists the characteristic
size for the voids and the characteristic stress on the void boundary, which
are dependent of vacancy excitation energy and the average volume occupied by
the metal atom; (4)both the stress and temperature close to the void are high
and may cause the melting, and they decrease quickly as the distance away from
the void increases; (5)the plastic zone surrounding the formed voids is
obtained and found to be governed by the characteristic stress; (6)the void
growth in the spallation processes may arise from the agglomeration of
vacancies rather than the emitting of dislocations. Most of the theoretical
results are novel and obtained first. And they are found to be in agreement
with the experimental results and the simulated results.

many practical applications, an important criterion is that a particular
photonic reagent prescription still produce a good, if not optimal, target
objective yield when transferred to a different system or laboratory, {even if
the same shaped pulse profile cannot be reproduced exactly. As a specific
example, we assess the potential for transferring optimal photonic reagents for
the objective of optimizing a ratio of photoproduct ions from a family of
halomethanes through three related experiments.} First, applying the same set
of photonic reagents with systematically varying second- and third-order chirp
on both laser systems generated similar shapes of the associated control
landscape (i.e., relation between the objective yield and the variables
describing the photonic reagents). Second, optimal photonic reagents obtained
from the first laser system were found to still produce near optimal yields on
the second laser system. Third, transferring a collection of photonic reagents
optimized on the first laser system to the second laser system reproduced
systematic trends in photoproduct yields upon interaction with the homologous
chemical family. Despite inherent differences between the two systems,
successful and robust transfer of photonic reagents is demonstrated in the
above three circumstances. The ability to transfer photonic reagents from one
laser system to another is analogous to well-established utilitarian operating
procedures with traditional chemical reagents. The practical implications of
the present results for experimental quantum control are discussed.

ultra-relativistic hadron becomes small, one observes a growth of their
density. When the parton density becomes close to a value of order
$1/\alpha_s$, it does not grow any longer, it saturates. These high density
effects seem to be well described by the Color Glass Condensate effective field
theory. On the experimental side, the LHC provides the best tool ever for
reaching the saturated phase of hadronic matter. For this reason saturation
physics is a very active branch of QCD during these past and coming years since
saturation theories and experimental data can be compared. I first deal with
the phenomenology of the proton-lead collisions performed in winter 2013 at the
LHC and whose data are about to be available. I compute the di-gluon production
cross-section which provides the simplest observable for finding quantitative
evidences of saturation in the kinematic range of the LHC. I also discuss the
limit of the strongly correlated final state at large transverse momenta and by
the way, generalize parton distribution to dense regime. The second main topic
is the quantum evolution of the quark and gluon spectra in nucleus-nucleus
collisions having in mind the proof of its universal character. This result is
already known for gluons and here I detail the calculation carefully. For
quarks universality has not been proved yet but I derive an intermediate
leading order to next-to leading order recursion relation which is a crucial
step for extracting the quantum evolution. Finally I briefly present an
independent work in group theory. I detail a method I used for computing traces
involving an arbitrary number of group generators, a situation often
encountered in QCD calculations.

Cramer-Rao bound as a function of the quantizer threshold for different
symmetric unimodal noise distributions. We show that, in some cases, the
intuitive choice of threshold position given by the symmetry of the problem,
placing the threshold on the true parameter value, can lead to locally worst
estimation performance.

better-understood thermonuclear shell flashes known as type I bursts. In search
of links between these two phenomena, we carried out a comprehensive analysis
of all $\textit{Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer}$ observations of the RB and found
six atypical type I bursts, featuring a double-peaked profile that is not due
to photospheric radius expansion. The bursts appear in a phase of the outburst
decay close to the onset of the type II bursts, when the source also switches
from the high/soft to the low/hard state. We also report the discovery of a
simultaneous low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation present in the persistent
emission as well as in the burst decaying emission. We discuss several
scenarios to understand the nature of the peculiar bursts and of the
accompanying oscillation, as well as their possible relation with each other
and with the type II burst phenomenon. We favour a model consisting of two
accretion channels, one polar and one equatorial, in a source viewed at low
inclination. We also, for the first time, clearly identify the atoll nature of
the RB.

combined magnetic, charge, and orbital order characteristic of the
""intermediate phase"", introduced by Efremov et al. in 2004 [Nature Mats. 3,
853]. This phase consists of spin dimers (thus incorporating aspects of the
Zener polaron phase (ZP) proposed in 2002 by Daoud-Aladine et al. [Phys. Rev.
Lett. 89, 097205]), though formed by a pair of parallel Mn spins of different
magnitude, in principle (thereby allowing for a degree of Mn charge
disproportionation: not necessarily as large as that of Mn$^{3+}$-Mn$^{4+}$ in
Goodenough's original CE phase [Phys. Rev. 100, 564 (1955)]). In the
intermediate phase, consecutive spin dimers localed along the planar zig-zag
chains are oriented at a constant relative angle $\Phi$ between them. Varying
Mn-charge disproportionation and $\Phi$, the intermediate phase should allow to
continuously interpolate between the two limiting cases of the CE phase and the
dimer phase denoted as ""orthogonal intermediate $\pi/2-$phase"". It is not easy
to find a microscopic model able to describe the phenomenological intermediate
phase adequately for the spin, charge, and orbital degrees of freedom
simultaneously. Here, we study the quantum spin excitations of a planar model
of interacting localized spins, which we found can stabilize the intermediate
phase classically. We compare the quantum magnons of the intermediate phase
with those of the CE and orthogonal $\pi/2$ phases, in the context of recent
experimental results.

consider the special case where each digraph is a directed path. In contrast to
the known result that any two directed paths admit a monotone simultaneous
embedding, there exist examples of three paths that do not admit such an
embedding for any possible choice of directions of monotonicity. We prove that
if a monotone simultaneous embedding of three paths exists then it also exists
for any possible choice of directions of monotonicity. We provide a
polynomial-time algorithm that, given three paths, decides whether a monotone
simultaneous embedding exists and, in the case of existence, also constructs
such an embedding. On the other hand, we show that already for three paths, any
monotone simultaneous embedding might need a grid of exponential (w.r.t. the

remnants of massive stellar explosions where non-thermal radiation is observed
from both the expanding shell-like shock front and from a pulsar wind nebula
(PWN) located inside of the SNR. These systems represent a unique evolutionary
phase of SNRs where observations in the radio, X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray regimes
allow the study of the co-evolution of both these energetic phenomena. In this
article, we report results from observations of the shell-type SNR G15.4+0.1
performed with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) and XMM-Newton. A
compact TeV $\gamma$-ray source, HESSJ1818-154, located in the center and
contained within the shell of G15.4+0.1 is detected by H.E.S.S. and featurs a
spectrum best represented by a power-law model with a spectral index of $-2.3
\pm 0.3_{stat} \pm 0.2_{sys}$ and an integral flux of
F$(>$0.42$\,\mathrm{TeV}$)=($0.9 \pm 0.3_{\mathrm{stat}} \pm
0.2_{\mathrm{sys}}) \times 10^{-12}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. Furthermore, a recent
observation with XMM-Newton reveals extended X-ray emission strongly peaked in
the center of G15.4+0.1. The X-ray source shows indications of an
energy-dependent morphology featuring a compact core at energies above 4 keV
and more extended emission that fills the entire region within the SNR at lower
energies. Together, the X-ray and VHE $\gamma$-ray emission provide strong
evidence of a PWN located inside the shell of G15.4+0.1, and this SNR can
therefore be classified as a \emph{composite} based on these observations. The
radio, X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray emission from the PWN is compatible with a
one-zone leptonic model that requires a low average magnetic field inside the
emission region. An unambiguous counterpart to the putative pulsar, which is
thought to power the PWN, has been detected neither in radio nor in X-ray
observations of G15.4+0.1.

convergence rate of $O(1/r)$ without per block strong convexity assumption.
Further, we show that when there are only two blocks of variables, a special

chains and classical integrable many-body systems. It provides an alternative
(to the nested Bethe ansatz) method for computation of spectra of the spin
chains. Namely, the spectrum of the quantum transfer matrix for the
inhomogeneous ${\mathfrak g}{\mathfrak l}_n$-invariant XXX spin chain on $N$
sites with twisted boundary conditions can be found in terms of velocities of
particles in the rational $N$-body Ruijsenaars-Schneider model. The possible
values of the velocities are to be found from intersection points of two
Lagrangian submanifolds in the phase space of the classical model. One of them
is the Lagrangian hyperplane corresponding to fixed coordinates of all $N$
particles and the other one is an $N$-dimensional Lagrangian submanifold
obtained by fixing levels of $N$ classical Hamiltonians in involution. The
latter are determined by eigenvalues of the twist matrix. To support this
picture, we give a direct proof that the eigenvalues of the Lax matrix for the
classical Ruijsenaars-Schneider model, where velocities of particles are
substituted by eigenvalues of the spin chain Hamiltonians, calculated through
the Bethe equations, coincide with eigenvalues of the twist matrix, with
certain multiplicities. We also prove a similar statement for the ${\mathfrak

realization of the results obtained in terms of branes and supersymmetric gauge

propagation of CMEs. In particular, we assess how it influences the speed and
shape of CMEs and under what conditions the flux rope ejection becomes a CME or
when it is quenched. We ran a set of MHD simulations that adopt an eruptive
initial magnetic configuration that has already been shown to be suitable for a
flux rope ejection. We varied the temperature of the backgroud corona and the
intensity of the initial magnetic field to tune the gravitational
stratification and the amount of ejected magnetic flux. We used an automatic
technique to track the expansion and the propagation of the magnetic flux rope
in the MHD simulations. From the analysis of the parameter space, we evaluate
the role of gravitational stratification on the CME speed and expansion. Our
study shows that gravitational stratification plays a significant role in
determining whether the flux rope ejection will turn into a full CME or whether
the magnetic flux rope will stop in the corona. The CME speed is affected by
the background corona where it travels faster when the corona is colder and
when the initial magnetic field is more intense. The fastest CME we reproduce
in our parameter space travels at 850 km/s. Moreover, the background
gravitational stratification plays a role in the side expansion of the CME, and
we find that when the background temperature is higher, the resulting shape of
the CME is flattened more. Our study shows that although the initiation
mechanisms of the CME are purely magnetic, the background coronal plasma plays
a key role in the CME propagation, and full MHD models should be applied when
one focusses especially on the production of a CME from a flux rope ejection.

to observe large numbers of extremely metal-poor stars. We present here the
Turn-Off Primordial Stars survey (TOPoS) that is conducted as an ESO Large
Programme at the VLT. This project has {four} main goals: (i) to understand the
formation of low-mass stars in a low-metallicity gas: determine the metal-weak
tail of the halo MDF below [M/H]=-3.5. In particular, we aim at determining the
critical metallicity, that is the lowest metallicity sufficient for the
formation of low-mass stars; (ii) to determine the relative abundance of the
elements in extremely metal-poor stars, which are the signature of the massive
first stars; (iii) to determine the trend of the lithium abundance at the time
when the Galaxy formed; and (iv) to derive the fraction of C-enhanced extremely
metal-poor stars with respect to normal extremely metal-poor stars. The large
number of stars observed in the SDSS provides a good sample of candidates of
stars at extremely low metallicity. Candidates with turn-off colours down to
magnitude g=20 were selected from the low-resolution spectra of SDSS by means
of an automated procedure. X-Shooter has the potential of performing the
necessary follow-up spectroscopy, providing accurate metallicities and
abundance ratios for several key elements for these stars. We here present the
stellar parameters of the first set of stars. The nineteen stars range in iron
abundance between -4.1 and -2.9 dex relative to the Sun. Two stars have a high
radial velocity and, according to our estimate of their kinematics, appear to
be marginally bound to the Galaxy and are possibly accreted from another
galaxy.

TeV emission. The degree of this correlation is still debated, particularly
when the flaring activity is followed down to very short time scales. This
correlation could challenge the synchrotron-self-Compton scenario in which one
relativistic electron population dominates the entire radiative output. We
argue that the LOFT Large Area Detector (10 m$^2$, LAD), thanks to its
unprecedented timing capability, will allow us to detect the X-ray counterpart
(2-50 keV) of the very fast variability observed at TeV energies, sheding light
on the nature of X-TeV connection. We will discuss the test case of PKS
2155-304, showing as it would be possible to look for any X-ray variability
occurring at very short timescales, never explored so far. This will put strong
constraints on the size and the location of any additional electron population
in the multi-zone scenario. Under this perspective, LOFT and the CTA
observatories, planned to operate in the same time frame, will allow us to
investigate in depth the connection between X-ray and TeV emissions. We also
discuss the potentialities of LOFT in measuring the change in spectral
curvature of the synchrotron spectra in HBLs which will make possible to
directly study the mechanism of acceleration of highly energetic electrons.
LOFT timing capability will be also promising in the study of Flat Spectrum
Radio Quasars (FSRQs) with flux $\ge 1$ mCrab. Constraints to the location of
the high energy emission will be given by temporal investigation on second
timescale and spectral trend analysis on minute timescales. This represents a
further link with CTA because of the rapid (unexpected) TeV emission recently

higher order networks provided the time-delay in the connections between nodes

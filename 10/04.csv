distribution has an atom at zero and analyse the impact of a mass at zero on
at-the-money implied volatility and the overall level of the smile. We further
show that the behaviour at small strikes is uniquely determined by the mass of
the atom up to high asymptotic order, under mild assumptions on the remaining
distribution on the positive real line. We investigate the structural
difference with the no-mass-at-zero case, showing how one
can--theoretically--distinguish between mass at the origin and a
heavy-left-tailed distribution. We numerically test our model-free results in
stochastic models with absorption at the boundary, such as the CEV process, and
in jump-to-default models. Note that while Lee's moment formula tells that
implied variance is at most asymptotically linear in log-strike, other
celebrated results for exact smile asymptotics such as Benaim and Friz (09) or
Gulisashvili (10) do not apply in this setting--essentially due to the
breakdown of Put-Call duality.

such a function is holomorphic on the right poly-halfplane and takes
skew-Hermitian matrix values on $(i\mathbb{R})^d$, or equivalently, is the
double Cayley transform (over the variables and over the matrix values) of an
inner function on the unit polydisk.
  Using Agler-Knese's characterization of rational inner Schur-Agler functions

appropriate Cayley transformations, we obtain characterizations of

problems with Einstein, he remarked that the introduction of the cosmological
term was the ""biggest blunder"" he ever made in his life. But the cosmological
constant rears its ugly head again and again and again. Apparently, Einstein
himself has never used the apercu ""biggest blunder""; nevertheless a vast
literature grew up around this notion and associated it with Einstein. The
present work is prompted by questions put by Mario Livio in his latest book
""Brilliant Blunders"" as to the phrase ""biggest blunder"": Did Einstein actually
say, ""biggest blunder""? I show that in 1947 Einstein wrote Lemaitre that he
found it ""very ugly"" that the field law of gravitation should be composed of
two logically independent terms. Earlier, in 1922 Einstein wrote Max Born that
he committed ""a monumental blunder some time ago"". In 1965 Born commented:
""Here Einstein admits that the considerations which led him to the positive-ray
experiments were wrong: 'a monumental [capital] blunder'"". It is likely that
when Einstein met Gamow he formulated his views in his native German, and
perhaps he told Gamow that suggesting his cosmological constant was a
""blunder"". I suggest that, Einstein perhaps told Gamow that the cosmological
constant was a ""capital blunder"" or a ""monumental blunder"", and Gamow could
have embellished Einstein's words to become the famous apercu ""biggest

result is tight for the toric code, giving a scaling with the linear system

and observed in the SnTe class of IV-VI semiconductors, which host metallic
surface states protected by crystal symmetries. In this work, we study thin
films of these materials and expose their potential for device applications. We
demonstrate that thin films of SnTe and Pb(1-x)Sn(x)Se(Te) grown along the
(001) direction are topologically nontrivial in a wide range of film thickness
and carry conducting spin-filtered edge states that are protected by the (001)
mirror symmetry via a topological invariant. Application of an electric field
perpendicular to the film will break the mirror symmetry and generate a band
gap in these edge states. This functionality motivates us to propose a novel
topological transistor device, in which charge and spin transport are maximally
entangled and simultaneously controlled by an electric field. The high on/off
operation speed and coupling of spin and charge in such a device may lead to
electronic and spintronic applications for topological crystalline insulators.

natural numbers or words over a finite alphabet, one cell much of the
combinatorial structure. We next turn to results in ergodic theory, which rely
strongly on combinatorial preliminaries. They assert essentially that certain
sets of return times are combinatorially rich. We finish by presenting the

construction of the ultraproduct in model theory.

Renewals can be interpreted as steps of a random walk, switching events in
two-state models, domain crossings of a random motion, etc. We here discuss a
renewal process in which successive events are separated by scale-free waiting
time periods. Among other ubiquitous long time properties, this process
exhibits aging: events counted initially in a time interval [0,t] statistically
strongly differ from those observed at later times [t_a,t_a+t]. In complex,
disordered media, processes with scale-free waiting times play a particularly
prominent role. We set up a unified analytical foundation for such anomalous
dynamics by discussing in detail the distribution of the aging renewal process.
We analyze its half-discrete, half-continuous nature and study its aging time
evolution. These results are readily used to discuss a scale-free anomalous
diffusion process, the continuous time random walk. By this we not only shed
light on the profound origins of its characteristic features, such as weak
ergodicity breaking. Along the way, we also add an extended discussion on aging
effects. In particular, we find that the aging behavior of time and ensemble
averages is conceptually very distinct, but their time scaling is identical at
high ages. Finally, we show how more complex motion models are readily
constructed on the basis of aging renewal dynamics.

the $\nu$-invariant. This requires either a framing or a corner structure. The
canonical framing provides a minimum for the classical action and the change of
framing encodes the structure of the action and possible anomalies. We
characterize the flux quantization condition on the C-field and the topological
action of the M5-brane via the Hopf invariant, and the dual of the C-field as
(a refinement of) an element of Hopf invariant two. In the signature
formulation, the contribution to the M-brane effective action is given by the
Maslov index of the corner. The Kervaire invariant implies that the effective
action of the M5-brane is quadratic. Our study leads to viewing the self-dual
string, which is the boundary of the M2-brane on the M5-brane worldvolume, as a
string theory in the sense of cobordism of manifolds with corners. We show that
the dynamics of the C-field and its dual are encoded in unified way in the
4-sphere, which suggests the corresponding spectrum as the generalized
cohomology theory describing the fields. The effective action of the corner is
captured by the $f$-invariant, which is an invariant at chromatic level two.
Finally, considering M-theory on manifolds with G_2 holonomy we show that the
canonical ${\rm G}_2$ structure minimizes the topological part of the M5-brane

cause mixing into different bound state configurations. We study the system
numerically for the simplest case of $N=4$, via an exact diagonalization of the

standard state-of-the-art first principles quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)
calculations of the structural dependence of the properties of VO$_2$. Using
this technique, we simulate the interactions between electrons explicitly,
which allows for the metal-insulator transition to naturally emerge,
importantly without ad-hoc adjustments. The QMC calculations show that the
structural transition directly causes the metal-insulator transition and a
change in the coupling of vanadium spins. This change in the spin coupling
results in a prediction of a momentum-independent magnetic excitation in the
insulating state. While two-body correlations are important to set the stage
for this transition, they do not change significantly when VO$_2$ becomes an

develop a novel spectral algorithm to analytically and efficiently integrate
over all possible frequency trajectories between consecutive time points. This
advance circumvents the limitations of existing methods which require
fine-tuning the discretization of the population allele frequency space when
numerically approximating requisite integrals. Furthermore, our method is
flexible enough to handle general diploid models of selection where the
heterozygote and homozygote fitness parameters can take any values, while
previous methods focused on only a few restricted models of selection. We
demonstrate the utility of our method on simulated data and also apply it to
analyze ancient DNA data from genetic loci associated with coat coloration in
horses. In contrast to previous studies, our exploration of the full fitness
parameter space reveals that a heterozygote advantage form of balancing
selection may have been acting on these loci.

violent disc instability (VDI) that drives gas into the centre (along with

formation timescale. This implies a threshold of 0.28 in the cold-to-total mass

half the star-forming galaxies contract to blue nuggets, while the rest form
extended stellar discs. Thus, the surface density of blue galaxies is expected
to be bimodal about 10^9 Msun/kpc^2, slightly increasing with mass. Blue
nuggets are expected to be rare at low z when the gas fraction is low. The blue
nuggets quench to red nuggets by complementary internal and external

decays with the interparticle distance with an exponent smaller than the
dimensionality of the embedding space, remain an outstanding challenge to
statistical physics. The internal energy of such systems lacks extensivity and
additivity. Although the extensivity can be restored by scaling the interaction
potential with the number of particles, the non-additivity still remains. Lack
of additivity leads to inequivalence of statistical ensembles. Before relaxing
to thermodynamic equilibrium, isolated systems with LR forces become trapped in
out-of-equilibrium quasi-stationary state (qSS), the lifetime of which diverges
with the number of particles. Therefore, in thermodynamic limit LR systems will
not relax to equilibrium. The qSSs are attained through the process of
collisionless relaxation. Density oscillations lead to particle-wave
interactions and excitation of parametric resonances. The resonant particles
escape from the main cluster to form a tenuous halo. Simultaneously, this cools
down the core of the distribution and dampens out the oscillations. When all
the oscillations die out the ergodicity is broken and a qSS is born. In this
report, we will review a theory which allows us to quantitatively predict the
particle distribution in the qSS. The theory is applied to various LR
interacting systems, ranging from plasmas to self-gravitating clusters and
kinetic spin models.

generally prohibited from obtaining all of its mass from the electroweak phase
transition. This implies a new scale of physics and mediator particles to
facilitate dark matter annihilation. In this work, we focus on dark matter that
annihilates through a generic Higgs portal. We show how partial wave unitarity
places an upper bound on the mass of the mediator (or dark) Higgs when its mass
is increased to be the largest scale in the effective theory. For models where
the dark matter annihilates via fermion exchange, an upper bound is generated
when unitarity breaks down around 8.5 TeV. Models where the dark matter
annihilates via fermion and higgs boson exchange push the bound to 45.5 TeV. We
also show that if dark matter obtains all of its mass from a new symmetry
breaking scale that scale is also constrained. We improve these constraints by
requiring perturbativity in the Higgs sector up to each unitarity bound. In
this limit, the bounds on the dark symmetry breaking vev and the dark Higgs
mass are now 2.4 and 3 TeV, respectively, when the dark matter annihilates via
fermion exchange. When dark matter annihilates via fermion and higgs boson
exchange, the bounds are now 12 and 14.2 TeV, respectively. The available
parameter space for Higgs portal dark matter annihilation is outlined. We also
show how the bounds are improved if Higgs portal dark matter is only a fraction
of the observed relic abundance. Finally, we discuss how to apply these
arguments to other dark matter scenarios and discuss prospects for direct
detection and future collider searches. If the Higgs portal is responsible for
dark matter annihilation, planned direct detection experiments will cover
almost all the parameter space. The ILC and/or VLHC, however, is needed to
establish the Higgs portal mechanism.

probing Higgs-Goldstone interactions through the weak boson fusion component of

radius for F-type stars (1.3-2.2 Msolar). This is in contrast to many older
star clusters that show a decreasing binary frequency with radius. We study
this phenomenon with sophisticated N-body modeling, exploring a range of
initial conditions, from smooth virialized density distributions to highly
substructured and collapsing configurations. We find that many of these models
can reproduce the cluster's observed properties, although with a modest
preference for substructured initial conditions. Our models produce the
observed radial trend in binary frequency through disruption of soft binaries
(with semi-major axes, a > 3000 AU), on approximately a crossing time (~ 5.4
Myr), preferentially in the cluster core. Mass segregation subsequently causes
the binaries to sink towards the core. After roughly one initial half-mass
relaxation time (t_rh(0) ~ 340 Myr) the radial binary frequency distribution
becomes bimodal, the innermost binaries having already segregated towards the
core, leaving a minimum in the radial binary frequency distribution that
marches outwards with time. After 4-6 t_rh(0), the rising distribution in the
halo disappears, leaving a radial distribution that rises only towards the
core. Thus, both a radial binary frequency distribution that falls towards the
core (as observed for NGC 1818) and one that rises towards the core (as for
older star clusters) can arise naturally from the same evolutionary sequence
owing to binary disruption and mass segregation in rich star clusters.

(NIR) spectra obtained with IRTF/SpeX. These M dwarfs are targets of the MEarth
Survey, a transiting planet survey searching for super Earths around
mid-to-late M dwarfs within 33pc. We present NIR spectral types and new IRTF
spectral templates in the Z, J, H and K-bands, created using M dwarfs with
near-solar metallicities. We developed two spectroscopic distance calibrations
that use NIR spectral type or an index based on the curvature of the K-band
continuum. Our distance calibration has a scatter of 14%. We searched 27 NIR
spectral lines and 10 spectral indices for metallicity sensitive features,
taking into account correlated noise in our estimates of the errors on these
parameters. We calibrated our relation using 36 M dwarfs in common proper pairs
with an F, G or K-type star of known metallicity. We validated the physical
association of these pairs using proper motions, radial velocities and
spectroscopic distance estimates. Our resulting metallicity calibration uses
the sodium doublet at 2.2um as the sole indicator for metallicity. It has an
accuracy of 0.12dex inferred from the scatter between the metallicities of the
primaries and the estimated metallicities of the secondaries. Our relation is
valid for NIR spectral types from M1V to M5V and for -1.0<[Fe/H]<+0.35dex. We
present a new metallicity relation using J-H and J-K colors that directly
relates two observables: the distance from the M dwarf main sequence and
equivalent width of the sodium line at 2.2um. We measured radial velocities by
modeling telluric features to determine the absolute wavelength calibration of
our spectra, and used M dwarf binaries, observations at different epochs, and
comparison to precisely measured radial velocities to demonstrate 4.4km/s
accuracy.

""breaking"" gauge symmetry, effectively reducing the spacetime SO(n,1)

theory and gravity, the observer field reduces the action to canonical form,
without using gauge fixing. In the 4d gravity case, the result is a manifestly

ingredient for this mechanism to work is the existence of higher derivative
terms in the dark $U(1)_F$ theory, or equivalently the existence of Lee-Wick
ghosts, that (i) allow for a non-perturbative solution to the mass gap equation

dependence of the generated masses on dark fermion $U(1)_F$ quantum numbers.
The generated flavor and chiral symmetry breaking in the dark sector is
transferred to the standard model Yukawa couplings at one loop level via Higgs
portal type scalar messenger fields. The latter carry quantum numbers of
squarks and sleptons. A new intriguing phenomenology is predicted that could be
potentially tested at the LHC, provided the characteristic mass scale of the

simulations of the collapse of rotating, magnetised molecular cloud cores to
form protostars. The calculations follow the formation and evolution of the
first hydrostatic core, the collapse to form a stellar core, the launching of
outflows from both the first hydrostatic core and stellar cores, and the
breakout of the stellar outflow from the remnant of the first core. We
investigate the roles of magnetic fields and thermal feedback on the outflow
launching process, finding that both magnetic and thermal forces contribute to
the launching of the stellar outflow. We also follow the stellar cores until
they grow to masses of up to 20 Jupiter-masses, and determine their properties.
We find that at this early stage, before fusion begins, the stellar cores have
radii of $\approx 3$ R$_\odot$ with radial entropy profiles that increase
outward (i.e. are convectively stable) and minimum entropies per baryon of
$s/k_{\rm B} \approx 14$ in their interiors. The structure of the stellar cores
is found to be insensitive to variations in the initial magnetic field
strength. With reasonably strong initial magnetic fields, accretion on to the
stellar cores occurs through inspiralling magnetised pseudo-discs with
negligible radiative losses, as opposed to first cores which effectively
radiate away the energy liberated in the accretion shocks at their surfaces. We
find that magnetic field strengths of >10 kG can be implanted in stellar cores
at birth.

functions, xi(rp,pi) and wp(rp), using volume-limited samples constructed from
a parent sample of over 130,000 galaxies with robust redshifts in seven
independent fields covering 9 sq. deg. of sky. We quantify how the
scale-dependent clustering amplitude increases with increasing luminosity and
redder color, with relatively small errors over large volumes. We find that red
galaxies have stronger small-scale (0.1<rp<1 Mpc/h) clustering and steeper
correlation functions compared to blue galaxies, as well as a strong color
dependent clustering within the red sequence alone. We interpret our measured
clustering trends in terms of galaxy bias and obtain values between
b_gal=0.9-2.5, quantifying how galaxies are biased tracers of dark matter
depending on their luminosity and color. We also interpret the color dependence
with mock catalogs, and find that the clustering of blue galaxies is nearly
constant with color, while redder galaxies have stronger clustering in the
one-halo term due to a higher satellite galaxy fraction. In addition, we
measure the evolution of the clustering strength and bias, and we do not detect
statistically significant departures from passive evolution. We argue that the
luminosity- and color-environment (or halo mass) relations of galaxies have not
significantly evolved since z=1. Finally, using jackknife subsampling methods,
we find that sampling fluctuations are important and that the COSMOS field is
generally an outlier, due to having more overdense structures than other
fields; we find that 'cosmic variance' can be a significant source of
uncertainty for high-redshift clustering measurements.

the strength of the He II emission compared with the Balmer lines is a result
the emission being similar to the broad-line region (BLR) of an AGN, but
lacking the outer, lower-ionization BLR gas. We show that the profile of He II

show that both the high-velocity gas of the inner BLR of normal AGNs and the

occur in the early phases of the evolution of a protoplanetary disk, the fate
of the clumps resulting from disk fragmentation and their role in planet
formation is still unclear. In the present study we investigate
semi-analytically their evolution following the contraction of a synthetic
population of clumps with varied initial structure and orbits coupled with the
surrounding disk and the central star. Our model is based on recently published
state-of-the-art 3D collapse simulations of clumps with varied thermodynamics.
Various evolutionary mechanisms are taken into account, and their effect is
explored both individually and in combination with others: migration and tidal
disruption, mass accretion, gap opening and disk viscosity. It is found that,
in general, at least 50% of the initial clumps survive tides, leaving behind
potential gas giant progenitors after ~10^5 yr of evolution in the disk. The
rest might be either disrupted or produce super-Earths and other low mass
planets provided that a solid core can be assembled on a sufficiently short
timescale, a possibility that we do not address in this paper. Extrapolating to
million year timescales, all our surviving protoplanets would lead to close-in
gas giants. This outcome might in part reflect the limitations of the migration
model adopted, and is reminiscent of the analogous result found in
core-accretion models in absence of fine-tuning of the migration rate. Yet it
suggests that a significant fraction of the clumps formed by gravitational
instability could be the precursors of Hot Jupiters.

method for probability measure quantization, deterministically realized by
means of a minimizing principle, balancing power repulsion and attraction

energy functional whose unique minimizer is actually the given probability
measure \omega to be quantized. Then we show that the discrete functionals,
defining the discrete quantizers as their minimizers, actually \Gamma-converge
to the target energy with respect to the narrow topology on the space of
probability measures. A key ingredient is the reformulation of the target
functional by means of a Fourier representation, which extends the
characterization of conditionally positive semi-definite functions from points
in generic position to probability measures. As a byproduct of the Fourier
representation, we also obtain compactness of sublevels of the target energy in
terms of uniform moment bounds, which already found applications in the
asymptotic analysis of corresponding gradient flows. To model situations where
the given probability is affected by noise, we additionally consider a modified
energy, with the addition of a regularizing total variation term and we
investigate again its point mass approximations in terms of \Gamma-convergence.
We show that such a discrete measure representation of the total variation can
be interpreted as an additional nonlinear potential, repulsive at a short
range, attractive at a medium range, and at a long range not having effect,
promoting a uniform distribution of the point masses.

to save energy. This work is a continuation of previous published work in [2].
The BT node is supported with efficient searchmethodss. The main objective of
this contribution is to control different types of objects from remote places

propose a way of synthesizing the vacuum dipole model (VDM) and the rotating
magnetosphere model (RMM). We first modify the VDM by assuming that the
parallel component of the inductive electric field is screened by charges. We
refer to the resulting model as the minimal model. We calculate the screening
charge density in the minimal model and compare it with the (Goldreich-Julian)
charge density in the RMM. We identify the plasma velocity in the minimal model
as the electric drift velocity due to the perpendicular component of the
inductive electric field. We define a class of synthesized models as a linear
combination of a fraction $y$ times the minimal model and $1-y$ times the RMM.
These models require a gap (with $E_\parallel\ne0$) between the corotating
stellar surface and the non-corotating magnetosphere. We present illustrative
plots of the charge density, of the location of nulls (where the charge density
is zero) and of the three components of the plasma velocity as a function of
the angles ($\theta,\psi$) relative to the rotation axis, for specific values
of the obliquity $\alpha$ and the parameter $y$. We discuss the question ""Can
any pulsar magnetosphere be corotating?"" critically, pointing out difficulties
associated with setting up corotation in the polar cap region. We speculate
that the corotating plasma may flow across the last closed field line from the
closed-field region. We suggest that abrupt changes in the spin-down rate in
some pulsars may be due to jumps between the RMM and the minimal model.

protocol, which involves interaction between a computer and a human.
Informally, a GOTCHA should satisfy two key properties: (1) The puzzles are
easy for the human to solve. (2) The puzzles are hard for a computer to solve
even if it has the random bits used by the computer to generate the final
puzzle --- unlike a CAPTCHA. Our main theorem demonstrates that GOTCHAs can be
used to mitigate the threat of offline dictionary attacks against passwords by
ensuring that a password cracker must receive constant feedback from a human
being while mounting an attack. Finally, we provide a candidate construction of
GOTCHAs based on Inkblot images. Our construction relies on the usability
assumption that users can recognize the phrases that they originally used to
describe each Inkblot image --- a much weaker usability assumption than
previous password systems based on Inkblots which required users to recall
their phrase exactly. We conduct a user study to evaluate the usability of our

equilibrium stability of Boolean variables (Ising spins) with competing
interactions (spin glasses) on scale-free networks. When the exponent that
describes the power-law decay of the connectivity of the network is strictly
larger than 3, the system undergoes a spin-glass transition. However, when the
exponent is equal to or less than 3, the glass phase is stable for all
temperatures. First, we perform finite-temperature Monte Carlo simulations in a
field to test the robustness of the spin-glass phase and show that the system
has a spin-glass phase in a field, i.e., exhibits a de Almeida-Thouless line.
Furthermore, we study avalanche distributions when the system is driven by a
field at zero temperature to test if the system displays self-organized
criticality. Numerical results suggest that avalanches (damage) can spread
across the whole system with nonzero probability when the decay exponent of the
interaction degree is less than or equal to 2, i.e., that Boolean decision
problems on scale-free networks with competing interactions can be fragile when

capped $\ell^1$ and minimax concavity penalty. First we establish the existence
of a global minimizer for the related optimization problems. Then we derive a
novel necessary optimality condition for the global minimizer using the
associated thresholding operator. The solutions to the optimality system are
coordinate-wise minimizers, and under minor conditions, they are also local
minimizers. Upon introducing the dual variable, the active set can be
determined using the primal and dual variables together. Further, this relation
lends itself to an iterative algorithm of active set type which at each step
involves first updating the primal variable only on the active set and then
updating the dual variable explicitly. When combined with a continuation
strategy on the regularization parameter, the primal dual active set method is

contraindication between crystal structures without inversion symmetry and
metallic behavior. Those containing oxygen are especially scarce. Here we
propose and demonstrate a design framework to remedy this property disparity
and accelerate NCSM-oxide discovery: The primary ingredient relies on the
removal of inversion symmetry through displacements of atoms whose electronic
degrees of freedom are decoupled from the states at the Fermi level. Density
functional theory calculations validate this crystal--chemistry strategy, and
we predict a new polar ruthenate exhibiting robust metallicity. We demonstrate
that the electronic structure is unaffected by the inclusion of spin-orbit
interactions (SOI), and that cation ordered SrCaRu$_2$O$_6$ exhibits a large
thermopower anisotropy ($\left|\Delta\mathcal{S}_\perp\right|\sim6.3 \mu

provide chemical and structural selection guidelines to aid in the search of
new NCS metals with enhanced thermopower anisotropy.

with nebular Lyman-alpha emission. We implemented the grid of individual
equivalent widths into the Starburst99 population synthesis code to generate
synthetic Lyman-alpha equivalent widths for representative star-formation

line with an equivalent width of $\sim$ -10$\pm$4 \AA in absorption for a
Salpeter initial mass function. The lower value (deeper absorption) results for
an instantaneous burst, and the higher value (shallower line) for continuous
star formation. Depending on the escape fraction of nebular Lyman-alpha
photons, the effect of stellar Lyman-alpha on the total profile ranges from
negligible to dominant. If the nebular escape fraction is 10%, the stellar

the relative model structure, but generally not in the usual one. In the usual
model structure, there are two quite different ways to lift cofibrant
approximations from the level of homology modules over homology algebras, where
they are classical projective resolutions, to the level of DG-modules over
DG-algebras. The new theory makes model theoretic sense of earlier explicit

Given a stream of two-dimensional data, a correlated aggregate query first
extracts a substream by applying a predicate along a primary dimension, and
then computes an aggregate along a secondary dimension. Prior work on
identifying heavy-hitters in streams has almost exclusively focused on
identifying heavy-hitters on a single dimensional stream, and these yield
little insight into the properties of heavy-hitters along other dimensions. In
typical applications however, an analyst is interested not only in identifying
heavy-hitters, but also in understanding further properties such as: what other
items appear frequently along with a heavy-hitter, or what is the frequency
distribution of items that appear along with the heavy-hitters. We consider
queries of the following form: In a stream S of (x, y) tuples, on the substream
H of all x values that are heavy-hitters, maintain those y values that occur
frequently with the x values in H. We call this problem as Correlated

longer have a matching lower bound.
  Moving beyond convex polygons, we show that edge-labelled triangulated
polygons with a single reflex vertex can have a disconnected flip graph. This
is in sharp contrast with the unlabelled case, where the flip graph is
connected for any triangulated polygon. For spiral polygons, we provide a
complete characterization of the orbits. This allows us to decide connectivity
of the flip graph of a spiral polygon in linear time. We also prove an upper
bound of $O(n^2)$ on the diameter of each connected component, which is optimal
in the worst case. We conclude with an example of a non-spiral polygon whose
flip graph has diameter $\Omega(n^3)$.

MAXI J0158-744, by the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) on 2011 November
11. This transient is characterized by a soft X-ray spectrum, a short duration
(1.3 x 10^3 s < \Delta T_d < 1.10 x 10^4 s), a very rapid rise (< 5.5 x 10^3
s), and a huge peak luminosity of 2 x 10^40 erg s^-1 in 0.7-7.0 keV band. With
Swift observations and optical spectroscopy from the Small and Moderate
Aperture Research Telescope System (SMARTS), we confirmed that the transient is
a nova explosion, on a white dwarf in a binary with a Be star, located near the
Small Magellanic Cloud. An extremely early turn-on of the super-soft X-ray
source (SSS) phase (< 0.44 d), the short SSS phase duration of about one month,
and a 0.92 keV neon emission line found in the third MAXI scan, 1296 s after
the first detection, suggest that the explosion involves a small amount of
ejecta and is produced on an unusually massive O-Ne white dwarf close to, or
possibly over, the Chandrasekhar limit. We propose that the huge luminosity
detected with MAXI was due to the fireball phase, a direct manifestation of the
ignition of the thermonuclear runaway process in a nova explosion.

complete. As in building a recommendation system, some new users may not have a

Hence, no available dataset is complete. In order to solve this problem, we
propose an approach called Collective Kernel Learning to infer hidden sample
similarity from multiple incomplete datasets. The idea is to collectively
completes the kernel matrices of incomplete datasets by optimizing the
alignment of the shared instances of the datasets. Furthermore, a clustering
algorithm is proposed based on the kernel matrix. The experiments on both

  We measured Stokes parameters and determined the polarization parameters in

the time lag between the unpolarized and polarized continuum flux variation of

the polarized continuum variability. The polarization in H{\alpha} is complex,

simultaneously estimate the varying coefficient functions and the spatial

an index-free multicolour disc blackbody component (p-free disc model) rather
than that from a standard accretion disc. While the peak and dip spectra are
complex, remarkably, their difference spectra constructed by treating dip
spectra as the background spectra of the peak spectra, can be modelled as a
single p-free disc component. Moreover, the variability at different
time-scales and energy bands of the peak flux level is always greater than or
equal to the variability of the dip flux level, which strengthens the
possibility that the peak flux level may be due to an independent spectral
component added to the dip one. We also verify it using joint spectral analysis
of peak and dip spectra with a variable emission component. Our result
substantiates the standard hypothesis that the oscillations are due to the
limit cycle behaviour of an unstable radiation pressure dominated inner disc.
However, in this interpretation, the flux variation of the unstable disc can be
several order of magnitudes as expected from some theoretical simulations and
need not be fine tuned to match the factor ~10 variation seen between the peak
and dip levels.

almost independent of isospin-asymmetry. As the density increases, the T=1

infrared or visible radiation is frequency up converted into the extreme
ultraviolet and x ray spectral regions. As a parametric process, high harmonic
generation should conserve the radiation energy, momentum and angular momentum.
Indeed, conservation of energy and momentum have been demonstrated. Angular
momentum of optical beams can be divided into two components: orbital and spin
(polarization). Orbital angular momentum is assumed to be conserved and
recently observed deviations were attributed to propagation effects. On the
other hand, conservation of spin angular momentum has thus far never been
studied, neither experimentally nor theoretically. Here, we present the first
study on the role of spin angular momentum in extreme nonlinear optics by
experimentally generating high harmonics of bi chromatic elliptically polarized
pump beams that interact with isotropic media. While observing that the
selection rules qualitatively correspond to spin conservation, we unequivocally
find that the process of converting pump photons into a single high-energy
photon does not conserve angular momentum, i.e. this process is not self
contained. In one regime, we numerically find that this major fundamental
discrepancy can be explained if the harmonic photons are emitted in pairs. Yet
in another regime, the ionizing electron carries the missing angular momentum.
The results presented here, apart from exploring the very foundations of HHG,
are also important for a variety of applications, as our system exhibits full
control over the harmonics polarization, from circular through elliptical to
linear polarization, without comprising the efficiency of the process. This
work paves the way for a broad range of applications with HHG, from ultrafast
circular dichroism to zepto-clocks and to attosecond quantum optics.

micro-crack interaction with the first micro-structural barrier in face-centred
cubic bi-crystals loaded in high cycle fatigue conditions. In the examined
configuration, we assumed that micro-crack transmission occurs due to surface
relief growth in the secondary grain ahead of the primary crack. This indirect
transmission mechanism is shown to strongly depend on grain-1/grain-2
disorientation. For instance, small grain disorientation induces plastic strain
localisation ahead of the crack and faster transmission through the first
barrier. Conversely, large grain-1/grain-2 disorientation induces plastic
strain spreading similar to crack tip blunting yielding slower indirect
transmission. A semi-analytical micro-model is developed based on the present
simulation results and complementary experimental observations highlighting the
original notion of first-barrier compliance. The model captures well known
experimental trends including effects of: grain-size, grain disorientation and
micro-crack retardation at the first barrier.

the case of cw control field, for exact two-photon resonance, the outgoing
photon displays an oscillating temporal distribution, which is the quantum
counterpart of a classical field ringing, while for nonzero two-photon detuning
a slow photon is produced. We demonstrate also that a train of readout control

this first paper of a series, we explore the continuum polarisation emerging
from radiatively accelerated and bent winds that were vertically launched from
the accretion disc in an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We simulate the
radiative transfer occurring in Thomson scattering and dust extinction media
over a range of morphological parameters and optical depths of the wind. We
demonstrate that the wind geometry proposed by Elvis with a
phenomenologically-derived bending angle of theta = 60deg still underestimates
the observed optical polarisation percentage of type-1 and type-2 AGN and does
not yet reproduce the expected dichotomy of the polarisation position angle. To
recover the observed polarisation properties, a smaller bending angle and some
amount of dust shielding in the equatorial region should be considered. A
two-phase outflow is found to generate both the observed polarisation dichotomy
and acceptable levels of polarisation degree if the wind has a bending angle
theta = 45deg, and the conical shells have a half-openingangle of 3deg <
delta_theta < 10deg. The absorbing dust column at the wind base should be in
the range of 1 < tau_dust < 4 (tau being integrated over 2000 - 8000 Angs).
Straightforward observational tests from spectropolarimetry and from
determining the number density of different AGN types can be performed to
further constrain the wind geometry.

of the iron emission line, and secondly, from the luminosity and temperature of
the weak soft component seen in this state, assuming it is the disc. We use
both of these methods on all the low/hard state spectra taken in timing mode of
XMM-Newton's EPIC-pn. We find that the two methods are not consistent with each
other, and the difference is not always in a single direction. The two methods
are neither model independent, nor are they independent of current calibration
issues. We find that the remaining small residuals in the EPIC-pn timing mode
response at the <3% level can have a dramatic effect on the fit parameters for
the reflected spectrum. There is also a mismatch in cross-calibration with
RXTE, which makes it difficult to use simultaneous data to extend the bandpass
of the spectral fits. Nonetheless, it is clear from the data that the iron line
is noticeably broader and stronger at higher L/LEdd, which is consistent with
the truncated disc models. We also show that it is likely that the soft
component changes character, from a stable component consistent with a
truncated disc at high L/LEdd, to a variable one with much smaller radius at
low L/LEdd. This adds to growing evidence for a complex soft component in the
low/hard state, possibly resulting from clumps torn from the edge of the
truncated disc.

the active part is entirely dissociated from the read-out element. This gives a

so-called magnetosphere. Modeling its global configuration is important to
understand the observational properties of the most magnetized neutron stars,
magnetars. On the other hand, magnetic fields in the interior are thought to
evolve on long time-scales, from thousands to millions of years. The magnetic
evolution is coupled to the thermal one, which has been the subject of study in
the last decades. An important part of this thesis presents the
state-of-the-art of the magneto-thermal evolution models of neutron stars

theory (SCFT) energy functional of multicomponent block copolymer systems which
contain more than two chemically distinct blocks. The SCFT has enjoyed
considered success and wide usage in investigation of the complex phase
behavior of block copolymers. It is well-known that the physical solutions of
the SCFT equations are saddle points, however, the analytic structure of the
SCFT energy functional has received little attention over the years. A recent
work by Fredrickson and collaborators [see the monograph by Fredrickson, The
Equilibrium Theory of Inhomogeneous Polymers, (2006), pp. 203-209] has analysed
the mathematical structure of the field energy functional for polymeric
systems, and clarified the index-1 saddle point nature of the problem produced
by the incompressibility constraint. In this paper, our goals are to draw
further attention to multicomponent block copolymers utilizing the
Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation used by Fredrickson and co-workers. We
first show that the saddle point character of the SCFT energy functional of
multicomponent block copolymer systems may be high index, not only produced by
the incompressibility constraint, but also by the Flory-Huggins interaction
parameters. Our analysis will be beneficial to many theoretical studies, such
as the nucleation theory of ordered phases, the mesoscopic dynamics. As an
application, we then utilize the discovery to develop the gradient-based
iterative schemes to solve the SCFT equations, and illustrate its performance
through several numerical experiments taking ABC star triblock copolymers as an
example.

possible sources that satisfy the requirements. By virtue of their fast ejecta,
such objects can accelerate protons to EeV energies, which in turn can interact
with the dense surrounding medium during propagation in their host galaxies to
produce sufficient high-energy neutrinos via proton--proton ($pp$) collisions.
Their accompanying gamma ray flux can remain below the diffuse isotropic gamma
ray background observed by the {\it Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT). In order
to test this scenario and discriminate from alternatives, the density of target
protons/nuclei and the residence time of CRs in the interacting region are
crucial uncertainties that need to be clarified. As long as the neutrinos and
EeV CRs originate from the same source class, detection of $\gtrsim 10\,$PeV
neutrinos may be expected within 5-10 years' operation of IceCube. Together
with further observations in the PeV range, the neutrinos can help in revealing
the currently unknown sources of EeV CRs.

biology. We construct the monotone splines lasso (MS-lasso) to select variables
and estimate effects using monotone spline (I-splines). The additive components
in the model are represented by their I-spline basis function expansion and the
component selection becomes that of selecting the groups of coefficients in the
I-spline basis function expansion. We use a recent procedure, called
cooperative lasso, to select sign-coherent groups, that is selecting the groups
with either exclusively non-negative or non-positive coefficients. This leads
to the selection of important covariates that have nonlinear monotone
increasing or decreasing effect on the response. We also introduce an adaptive
version of the MS-lasso which reduces both the bias and the number of false
positive selections considerably. We compare the MS-lasso and the adaptive
MS-lasso with other existing methods for variable selection in high dimensions
by simulation and illustrate the method on two relevant genomic data sets.
Results indicate that the (adaptive) MS-lasso has excellent properties compared

as well as on board of satellites, mainly in the Radio, Optical, X-ray, and
Gamma-ray bands, astrophysicists had the opportunity to thoroughly investigate
the so-called Recycling Scenario: the evolutionary path leading to the
formation of a Millisecond Radio Pulsar. The most intriguing phase is certainly
the spin-up stage during which, because of the accretion of matter and angular
momentum, the neutron star accumulates an extraordinary amount of mechanical
rotational energy, up to one percent of its whole rest-mass energy. These
millisecond spinning neutron stars are truly extreme physical objects: General
and Special Relativity are fully in action, since their surfaces, attaining
speeds close to one fifth of the speed of light, are located just beyond their
Schwartzscild Radius, and electrodynamical forces, caused by the presence of
huge surface magnetic fields of several hundred million Gauss, display their
spectacular properties accelerating electrons up to such energies to promote
pair creation in a cascade process responsible for the emission in Radio and
Gamma-ray. The rotational energy is swiftly converted and released into
electromagnetic power which, in some cases, causes the neutron star to outshine
with a luminosity of one hundred Suns. In this paper I will review some of the
most recent discoveries on (accreting) millisecond pulsars.

thermodynamic behavior of a molecular system by using mesoparticles
representing several molecules. Interactions between mesoparticles are modelled
by an interparticle potential, and an additional internal equation of state is
used to account for the thermic contribution of coarse grained internal degrees
of freedom. Moreover, as strong non-equilibrium situations over a wide range of
pressure and density are targeted, the internal compressibility of these
mesoparticles has to be considered. This is done by introducing a dependence of
the potential on the local environment of the mesoparticles, either by defining
a spherical local density or by means of a Voronoi tessellation. As an example,
a local density dependent potential is fitted to reproduce the Hugoniot curve
of a model of nitromethane, where each mesoparticle represents one thousand
molecules.

between the Bethe free energy (or entropy) and the Shannon conditional entropy
of graphical error correcting codes. The main result shows that the Bethe free
energy associated with a low-density parity-check code used over a binary
symmetric channel in a large noise regime is, with high probability,
asymptotically exact as the block length grows. To arrive at this result we
develop new techniques for rather general graphical models based on the loop
sum as a starting point and the polymer expansion from statistical mechanics.
The true free energy is computed as a series expansion containing the Bethe
free energy as its zero-th order term plus a series of corrections. It is
easily seen that convergence criteria for such expansions are satisfied for
general high-temperature models. We apply these general results to ensembles of
low-density generator-matrix and parity-check codes. While the application to
generator-matrix codes follows standard ""high temperature"" methods, the case of
parity-check codes requires non-trivial new ideas because the hard constraints
correspond to a zero-temperature regime. Nevertheless one can combine the
polymer expansion with expander and counting arguments to show that the
difference between the true and Bethe free energies vanishes with high
probability in the large block

theory, with new Physics lying beyond it. Supersymmetric extensions are one
possibility: they address some of the Standard Model's shortcomings, such as
the instability of the Higgs boson mass under radiative corrections. In this
thesis, some topics related to the renormalization of supersymmetric models are
analyzed. One of them is the automatic computation of the Lagrangian and the
renormalization group equations of these models, which is a hard and
error-prone process if carried out by hand. The generic renormalization group
equations themselves are extended so as to include those models which have more
than a single abelian gauge factor group. Such situations can occur in grand
unified theories, for example. For a wide range of SO(10)-inspired
supersymmetric models, we also show that the renormalization group imprints on
sparticle masses some information on the higher energies behavior of the
models. Finally, in some cases these theories introduce charged lepton flavor
violating interactions, which can change the ratio $\Gamma\left(K\rightarrow
e\nu\right)/\Gamma\left(K\rightarrow\mu\nu\right)$. In light of experimental
bounds on other observables, our analysis shows that any change over the
Standard Model prediction must be smaller than the current experimental
sensitivity on this observable.

outside the single-photon strong coupling regime, for strong cavity drive, and
rather large limit cycle amplitudes. The general approach taken here provides a
natural starting point for further studies of quantum effects in optomechanics.

supernova CSS121015:004244+132827 (z=0.2868) spanning epochs from -30 days
(rest frame) to more than 200 days after maximum. CSS121015 is one of the more
luminous supernova ever found and one of the best observed. The photometric
evolution is characterized by a relatively fast rise to maximum (~40 days in
the SN rest frame), and by a linear post-maximum decline. The light curve shows
no sign of a break to an exponential tail. A broad Halpha is first detected at
~ +40 days (rest-frame). Narrow, barely-resolved Balmer and [O III] 5007 A
lines, with decreasing strength, are visible along the entire spectral
evolution. The spectra are very similar to other super luminous supernovae
(SLSNe) with hydrogen in their spectrum, and also to SN 2005gj, sometimes
considered a type Ia interacting with H-rich CSM. The spectra are also similar
to a subsample of H-deficient SLSNe. We propose that the properties of
CSS121015 are consistent with the interaction of the ejecta with a massive,
extended, opaque shell, lost by the progenitor decades before the final
explosion, although a magnetar powered model cannot be excluded. Based on the
similarity of CSS121015 with other SLSNe (with and without H), we suggest that
the shocked-shell scenario should be seriously considered as a plausible model
for both types of SLSN.

as \bar{k} increases. However, when average degree k of inter-network is
increased, the system become robust for all coupling strength. Additionally,
when nodes of between networks are highly connected, the hybrid order region

one driver mutation and several passenger mutations. Our analysis is based on a
multi type branching process: We model individual cells which can either divide
or undergo apoptosis. In case of a cell division, the two daughter cells can
mutate, which potentially confers a change in fitness to the cell. In contrast
to previous models, the change in fitness induced by the driver mutation
depends on the genetic context of the cell, in our case on the number of
passenger mutations. The passenger mutations themselves have no or only a very
small impact on the cell's fitness. While our model is not designed as a
specific model for a particular cancer, the underlying idea is motivated by
clinical and experimental observations in Burkitt Lymphoma. In this tumor, the
hallmark mutation leads to deregulation of the MYC oncogene which increases the
rate of apoptosis, but also the proliferation rate of cells. This increase in
the rate of apoptosis hence needs to be overcome by mutations affecting
apoptotic pathways, naturally leading to an epistatic fitness landscape. This
model shows a very interesting dynamical behavior which is distinct from the
dynamics of cancer initiation in the absence of epistasis. Since the driver
mutation is deleterious to a cell with only a few passenger mutations, there is
a period of stasis in the number of cells until a clone of cells with enough
passenger mutations emerges. Only when the driver mutation occurs in one of
those cells, the cell population starts to grow rapidly.

to define, monitor and modify server groups without the need for server

shock loaded so as to undergo a solid-liquid phase change on shock. The
reflection of the shock wave at the interface metal/vacuum gives rise to the
ejection of 2D jets/sheets of atoms (Richtmyer-Meshkov instabilities in the
continuum limit) which develop and break up, forming ejecta (fragments) of
different volumes (or mass). The fragmentation process is investigated by
analyzing the evolution of the resulting volume distribution of the ejecta as a
function of time. Two metals are studied (Cu and Sn) and the amplitude of the
roughness is varied. The simulations show that the associated distributions
exhibit a generic behavior with the sum of two distinct terms of varying
weight, following the expansion rate of the jets: in the small size limit, the
distribution obeys a power law dependence with an exponent equal to 1.15 plus
or minus 0.08 and in the large size limit, it obeys an exponential form. These
two components are interpreted, with the help of additional simple simulations,
as the signature of two different basic mechanisms of fragmentation. The power
law dependence results from the fragmentation of a 2D network of ligaments
arranged following a fractal (scale free) geometry and generated when the
sheets of liquid metal expand and tear. The exponential distribution results
from a 1D Poisson fragmentation process of the largest ligaments previously
generated. Unlike the power law distribution, it is governed by a
characteristic length scale which may be provided by energy balance principle.

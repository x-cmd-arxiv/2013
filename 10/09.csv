turned out to be one of the prime candidates for an exotic state in the
charmonium spectrum. It was recently proposed that the $Y(4260)$ should have a
prominent $D_1\bar{D}+c.c.$ molecular component that is strongly correlated
with the production of the charged $Z_c(3900)$. In this paper we demonstrate
that the nontrivial cross section line shapes of $e^+e^-\to J/\psi\pi\pi$ and
$h_c\pi\pi$ can be naturally explained by the molecular scenario. As a
consequence we find a significantly smaller mass for the $Y(4260)$ than
previous studied. In the $e^+e^-\to \bar D D^*\pi+c.c.$ process, with the
inclusion of an additional $S$-wave $\bar D^*\pi$ contribution constrained
  from data on the $D\bar D^*$ invariant mass distribution, we obtain a good
agreement with the data of the angular distributions. We also predict an
unusual line shape of $Y(4260)$ in this channel that may serve as a smoking gun
for a predominantly molecular nature of $Y(4260)$. Improved measurements of
these observables are therefore crucial for a better understanding of the
structure of this famous resonance.

brown dwarfs, and help us to constrain evolutionary and atmospheric models,
break the age-mass degeneracy and reveal unresolved binaries.
  We measured absolute trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions of 6 cool
brown dwarfs using background galaxies to establish an absolute reference
frame. We derive the absolute J-mag. The six T brown dwarfs in our sample have
spectral types between T2.5 and T7.5 and magnitudes in J between 13.9 and 18.0,
with photometric distances below 25 pc.
  The observations were taken in the J-band with the Omega-2000 camera on the
3.5 m telescope at Calar Alto, during a time period of 27 months, between March
2011 and June 2013. The number of epochs varied between 11 and 12 depending on
the object. The reduction of the astrometric measurements was carried out with
respect to the field stars. The relative parallax and proper motions were
transformed into absolute measurements using the background galaxies in our
fields.
  We obtained absolute parallaxes for our six brown dwarfs with a precision
between 3 and 6 mas. We compared our results in a color-magnitude diagram with
other brown dwarfs with determined parallax and with the BT-Settl 2012
atmospheric models. For four of the six targets we found a good agreement in
luminosity with objects of similar spectral types. We obtained an improved
accuracy in the parallaxes and proper motions in comparison to previous works.
The object 2MASS J11061197+2754225 is more than 1 mag overluminous in all bands
pointing to binarity or high order multiplicity.

(2000). His structure for quasars was achieved to unify the emission and
absorption features observed in active galactic nuclei (AGN) and can be used as
an alternative scenario to the typical dusty torus that is extensively used to
account for AGN circumnuclear obscuration. Using Monte Carlo radiative transfer
simulations, we model an obscuring outflow arising from an emitting accretion
disk and examine the resulting polarization degree, polarization angle and
polarized flux. Polarization cartography reveals that a disk-born outflow has a
similar torus morphology in polar viewing angles, with bright polarized fluxes
reprocessed onto the wind funnel. At intermediate and edge-on inclinations, the
model is rather close to a double-conical wind, with higher fluxes in the cone
bases. It indicates that the optically thick outflow is not efficient enough to
avoid radiation escaping from the central region, particularly due to the
geometrically thin divergence angle of the outflow. As parametrized in this
research note, a dusty outflow does not seem to be able to correctly reproduce
the polarimetric behavior of an usual dusty torus. Further refinement of the

explain why the gaugino bilinear is required in supersymmetric gauge theories
with varying number of colors and flavors. By working in the Higgs phase,
gauging a flavor group, or working below the scale of gaugino condensation,
each of these theories has a local effective description in which we can
identify the bilinear term, establishing its necessity in the microscopic
theory. For example, in theories that exhibit gaugino condensation, the
potential in the very low energy theory is supersymmetric precisely due to the
relation between the nonperturbative superpotential and the gaugino bilinear
terms. Similarly, the gravitino mass appears from its coupling to the gaugino
bilinear.

lower and upper triangular lifting matrices, an Abelian group of unimodular

lifting structures are given for linear phase lifting factorizations of the two

progression of the disease and indicates the expected response to interventions
with drugs. Such processes have been modeled using Markov processes. An
essential step for the simulation of such models is then the determination of
state transition probabilities. We here consider the experimentally more
realistic scenario in which the measurement of cell population sizes is noisy,
leading to a particular hidden Markov model. In this context, randomness in
measurement is related to noisy measurements, which are used for the estimation
of the transition probability matrix. Randomness in sampling, on the other
hand, is here related to the error in estimating the state probability from
small cell populations. Using aggregated data of fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS) measurement, we develop a minimum mean square error estimator
(MMSE) and maximum likelihood (ML) estimator and formulate two problems to find
the minimum number of required samples and measurements to guarantee the
accuracy of predicted population sizes using a transition probability matrix
estimated from noisy data. We analyze the properties of two estimators for
different noise distributions and prove an optimal solution for Gaussian
distributions with the MMSE. Our numerical results show, that for noisy
measurements the convergence mechanism of transition probabilities and steady
states differ widely from the real values if one uses the standard
deterministic approach in which measurements are assumed to be noise free.

of the envelopes surrounding young planetary cores of 5, 10, and 15 Earth
masses, located in a protoplanetary disk at 5 and 10 AU from a solar-mass star.
We apply a nested-grid technique to resolve the thermodynamics of the disk at
the orbital-radius length scale and that of the envelope at the core-radius
length scale. The gas is modeled as a solar mixture of molecular and atomic
hydrogen, helium, and their ions. The equation of state accounts for both gas
and radiation, and gas energy includes contributions from rotational and
vibrational states of molecular hydrogen and from ionization of atomic species.
Dust opacities are computed from first principles, applying the full Mie
theory. One-dimensional (1D) calculations of planet formation are used to
supplement the 3D calculations by providing energy deposition rates in the
envelope due to solids accretion. We compare 1D and 3D envelopes and find that
masses and gas accretion rates agree within factors of 2, and so do envelope
temperatures. The trajectories of passive tracers are used to define the size
of 3D envelopes, resulting in radii much smaller than the Hill radius and
smaller than the Bondi radius. The moments of inertia and angular momentum of
the envelopes are determined and the rotation rates are derived from the
rigid-body approximation, resulting in slow bulk rotation. We find that the
polar flattening is < ~0.05. The dynamics of the accretion flow is examined by
tracking the motion of tracers that move into the envelope. The anisotropy of
this flow is characterized in terms of both its origin and impact site at the
envelope surface. Gas merges with the envelope preferentially at mid- to high
latitudes.

simple view of an initial basic ""rapid"" process. In a careful and homogeneous
analysis of the ""First stars"" sample (eighty per cent of the stars have a
metallicity [Fe/H]=-3.1$\pm$0.4), it has been shown that at this metallicity
[Eu/Ba] is constant, and therefore the Eu-rich stars (generally called
""r-rich"") are also Ba-rich. The very large variation of [Ba/Fe] (existence of
""r-poor"" and ""r-rich"" stars) induces that the early matter was not perfectly
mixed. On the other hand, the distribution of the values of [Sr/Ba] vs. [Ba/Fe]
appears with well defined upper and lower envelopes. No star was found with
[Sr/Ba]<-0.5 and the scatter of [Sr/Ba] increases regularly when [Ba/Fe]
decreases. To explain this behavior, we suggest that an early ""additional""
process forming mainly first peak elements would affect the initial composition
of the matter. For a same quantity of accreted matter, this additional Sr
production would barely affect the r-rich matter (which already contains an
important quantity of Sr) but would change significantly the composition of the
r-poor matter. The abundances found in the CEMP-rs stars reflect the transfer
of heavy elements from a defunct AGB companion. But the abundances of the heavy
elements in CEMP-no stars present the same characteristics as the the
abundances in the EMP stars.

redshift z~6-7, and while the sources responsible for this process have yet to
be identified, star-forming galaxies are often considered the most likely
candidates. However, the contribution from z>6 galaxies to cosmic reionization
critically depends on the fraction of ionizing (Lyman continuum, LyC) photons
escaping from these objects and into the intergalactic medium. At z<4, the
escaping LyC flux can be measured directly, but the opacity of the neutral
intergalactic medium precludes such measurements at higher redshifts. In a
recent paper, we argue that since the LyC escape fraction regulates the
contribution of nebular emission to the rest-frame optical/UV spectra of
galaxies, the James Webb Space Telescope should be able to indirectly assess
the LyC escape fraction for galaxies at z~6-9. JWST can, on the other hand, not
constrain the fraction of LyC photons directly absorbed by dust, and this is
where SPICA comes in. The dust continuum emission from gravitationally lensed
LyC-leakers at z=6 may in principle be detectable with SPICA, thereby
constraining the level of LyC extinction in these objects.

work quantitatively explains the recently observed suppression of chemical
reactions between two rotational states of fermionic KRb molecules confined in
one-dimensional tubes with a weak lattice along the tubes [Yan et al., Nature
501, 521-525 (2013)]. New loss rate measurements performed for different
lattice parameters but under controlled initial conditions allow us to show
that the loss suppression is a consequence of the combined effects of lattice
confinement and the continuous quantum Zeno effect. A key finding, relevant for
generic strongly reactive systems, is that while a single-band theory can
qualitatively describe the data, a quantitative analysis must include multiband
effects. Accounting for these effects reduces the inferred molecule filling
fraction by a factor of five. A rate equation can describe much of the data,
but to properly reproduce the loss dynamics with a fixed filling fraction for
all lattice parameters we develop a mean-field model and benchmark it with
numerically exact time-dependent density matrix renormalization group
calculations.

by including the nonlocal dielectric response of the film, which is an
important correction at short distances. Remarkably, the fluctuations
responsible for decoherence of charge qubits from a thin film are greatly
enhanced over the case of a conducting half space. The decoherence times can be
reduced by over an order of magnitude by decreasing the film thickness. This
appears to be due to the leakage into the vacuum of modes that are well
localized in the perpendicular direction. There is no corresponding effect for
spin qubits (magnetic field fluctuations). We also show that a nonlocal
dielectric function naturally removes the divergence in the Casimir force at
vanishing separation between two metallic sheets or halfspaces. In the
separation regime where a local and nonlocal treatment are noticeably distinct,
the Casimir attraction between two thin sheets and two halfspaces are

sequence consisting of T symbols, first, we prove mathematical that the total

In the meantime, we define the indicator sequences vector. Using the orthogonal

construct some special numerical representations of the symbolic sequence and
characterize the signal-to-noise ratios of the power spectrum of the numerical
representations. After calculating the discrete Fourier transform of those
special numerical representations, the signal-to-noise ratios of them can be
figured out. Mathematical theorems prove that the signal-to-noise ratio of the
Fourier spectrum of those special representations of the symbolic sequence is
T/(T-1) times the signal-to-noise ratio of the representation by T base

sequences or protein sequences in the frequency domain, if one uses the
signal-to-noise ratios of special representations as the distinguishing
criterion, the distinguishing results only depend upon the distribution of the
symbols in the symbolic sequence and their mathematical constructions of
representations, but do not relate to the chemical or biological meanings of
the representations.

and 68th percentile range of 1.8 +2.3/-1.0 R_(vir,host) for progenitors of z=0

significantly larger distances (3.7 +3.3/-2.2 R_(vir,host) at z=0). This
difference arises because different physical processes set peak circular
velocity (typically, ~1:5 and larger mergers which cause transient circular
velocity spikes) and peak mass (typically, smooth accretion) for infalling
halos. We find that infalling halos also stop having significant mergers well
before they enter the virial radius of their eventual hosts. Mergers larger
than a 1:40 ratio in halo mass end for infalling halos at similar
clustercentric distances (~ 1.9 R_(vir,host)) as the end of overall mass
accretion. However, mergers larger than 1:3 typically end for infalling halos
at more than 4 virial radial away from their eventual hosts. This limits the
ability of mergers to affect quenching and morphology changes in clusters. We
also note that the transient spikes which set peak circular velocity may lead
to issues with abundance matching on that parameter, including unphysical
galaxy stellar mass growth profiles near clusters; we propose a simple
observational test to check if a better halo proxy for galaxy stellar mass
exists.

X-rays, with the lag becoming longer as we move from the UV (2-3 days) to the

anisotropic, on the condensation of multiphase gas in cluster cores. Previous
hydrodynamic simulations have shown that cold gas condenses out of the hot ICM
in thermal balance only when the ratio of the cooling time ($t_{\rm cool}$) and
the free-fall time ($t_{\rm ff}$) is less than $\approx 10$. Since thermal
conduction is significant in the ICM and it suppresses local cooling at small
scales, it is imperative to include thermal conduction in such studies. We find
that anisotropic (along local magnetic field lines) thermal conduction does not
influence the condensation criterion for a general magnetic geometry, even if
thermal conductivity is large. However, with isotropic thermal conduction cold
gas condenses only if conduction is suppressed (by a factor $\lesssim 0.3$)
with respect to the Spitzer value.

parent clusters, go through the red supergiant (RSG) phase during their
lifetimes. Nonetheless, although many dozens of massive runaways were found to
be associated with bow shocks, only two RSG bow-shock-producing stars,
Betelgeuse and \mu Cep, are known to date. In this paper, we report the
discovery of an arc-like nebula around the late M-type star IRC-10414 using the
SuperCOSMOS H-alpha Survey. Our spectroscopic follow-up of IRC-10414 with the
Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) showed that it is a M7 supergiant,
which supports previous claims on the RSG nature of this star based on
observations of its maser emission. This was reinforced by our new radio- and
(sub)millimeter-wavelength molecular line observations made with the Atacama
Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) 12 meter telescope and the Effelsberg 100 m radio
telescope, respectively. The SALT spectrum of the nebula indicates that its
emission is the result of shock excitation. This finding along with the
arc-like shape of the nebula and an estimate of the space velocity of IRC-10414
(\approx 70\pm20 km/s) imply the bow shock interpretation for the nebula. Thus,
IRC-10414 represents the third case of a bow-shock-producing RSG and the first
one with a bow shock visible at optical wavelengths. We discuss the smooth
appearance of the bow shocks around IRC-10414 and Betelgeuse and propose that
one of the necessary conditions for stability of bow shocks generated by RSGs
is the ionization of the stellar wind. Possible ionisation sources of the wind
of IRC-10414 are proposed and discussed.

most important problems of computer science, the Boolean satisfiability problem
(SAT). More specifically, we focus on sharp-SAT or equivalently #SAT - the
problem of counting the number of solutions to a Boolean satisfaction formula.
#SAT can be cast into a statistical-mechanical language, where it reduces to
calculating the partition function of an Ising spin Hamiltonian with multi-spin
interactions. We show that Kramers-Wannier duality can be generalized to apply
to such multi-connected spin networks. We present an exact dual partner to #SAT
and explicitly verify their equivalence with a few simple examples. It is shown
that the NP-completeness of the original problem maps on the complexity of the
dual problem of enumerating the number of non-negative solutions to a
Diophantine system of equations. We discuss the implications of this duality
and the prospects of similar dualities applied to computer science problems.

$10^{9.3}$--$10^{11.6} M_{\odot}$. On the accounting side of the ledger, we
show that a surprisingly constant 20--25% mass fraction of produced metals
remain in galaxies' stars, interstellar gas and interstellar dust, with little
dependence of this fraction on the galaxy stellar mass (omitting those metals
immediately locked up in remnants). Thus, the bulk of metals are outside of
galaxies, produced in the progenitors of today's $L^*$ galaxies. The COS-Halos
survey is uniquely able to measure the mass of metals in the circumgalactic
medium (to impact parameters of $< 150$ kpc) of low-redshift $\sim L^*$
galaxies. Using these data, we map the distribution of CGM metals as traced by
both the highly ionized OVI ion and a suite of low-ionization species; combined
with constraints on circumgalactic dust and hotter X-ray emitting gas out to
similar impact parameters, we show that $\sim 40$% of metals produced by
$M_{\star}\sim 10^{10}M_{\odot}$ galaxies can be easily accounted for out to
150 kpc. With the current data, we cannot rule out a constant mass of metals
within this fixed physical radius. This census provides a crucial boundary
condition for the eventual fate of metals in galaxy evolution models.

  MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stu301",,"astro-ph.CO astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Early-type galaxies (ETGs) are observed to be more compact, on average, at $z
\gtrsim 2$ than at $z\simeq 0$, at fixed stellar mass. Recent observational
works suggest that such size evolution could reflect the similar evolution of
the host dark matter halo density as a function of the time of galaxy
quenching. We explore this hypothesis by studying the distribution of halo
central velocity dispersion ($\sigma_0$) and half-mass radius ($r_{\rm h}$) as
functions of halo mass $M$ and redshift $z$, in a cosmological $\Lambda$-CDM
$N$-body simulation. In the range $0\lesssim z\lesssim 2.5$, we find
$\sigma_0\propto M^{0.31-0.37}$ and $r_{\rm h}\propto M^{0.28-0.32}$, close to
the values expected for homologous virialized systems. At fixed $M$ in the
range $10^{11} M_\odot \lesssim M\lesssim 5.5 \times 10^{14} M_\odot$ we find
$\sigma_0\propto(1+z)^{0.35}$ and $r_{\rm h}\propto(1+z)^{-0.7}$. We show that
such evolution of the halo scaling laws is driven by individual haloes growing
in mass following the evolutionary tracks $\sigma_0\propto M^{0.2}$ and $r_{\rm
h}\propto M^{0.6}$, consistent with simple dissipationless merging models in
which the encounter orbital energy is accounted for. We compare the $N$-body
data with ETGs observed at $0\lesssim z\lesssim3$ by populating the haloes with
a stellar component under simple but justified assumptions: the resulting
galaxies evolve consistently with the observed ETGs up to $z \simeq 2$, but the
model has difficulty reproducing the fast evolution observed at $z\gtrsim 2$.
We conclude that a substantial fraction of the size evolution of ETGs can be
ascribed to a systematic dependence on redshift of the dark matter haloes
structural properties.

phase dynamically occurs. The effect emerges as a result of dynamics of the
topologically nontrivial sectors in expanding universe. Technically the effect
can be described in terms of the auxiliary fields which effectively describe
the dynamics of the topological sectors in a gauge theory. Inflaton in this
framework is an auxiliary topological non-propagating field with no canonical
kinetic term, similar to known topologically ordered phases in condensed matter
systems. We explain many deep questions in this framework using the so-called
weakly coupled ""deformed QCD"" toy model.While this theory is weakly coupled
gauge theory, it preserves all the crucial elements of strongly interacting
gauge theory, including confinement, nontrivial $\theta$ dependence, degeneracy
of the topological sectors, etc. We discuss a specific realization of these
ideas using a scaled up version of QCD, coined as \qcd, with the scale
M_{PL}\gg \Lbar\gg \sqrt[3]{M_{EW}^2M_{PL}}\sim 10^8 {\mathrm{GeV}}. If no
other fields are present in the system de Sitter phase will be the final
destination of evolution of the universe. If other interactions are present in
the system, the inflationary de Sitter phase lasts for a finite period of time.
The inflation starts from the thermal equilibrium state long after the \qcd
-confinement phase transition at temperature T_{i}\sim
\Lbar\sqrt{\frac{\Lbar}{M_{PL}}}. The end of inflation is triggered by the
coupling with gauge bosons from the Standard Model. The corresponding
interaction is unambiguously fixed by the triangle anomaly. Number of e-folds
in the \qcd-inflation framework is determined by the gauge coupling constant at
the moment of inflation, and estimated as N_{\rm inf}\sim \alpha_s^{-2}\sim
10^2.

to predict the phenotypic values of new individuals on the basis of training
data. CS addresses a problem common to both endeavors, namely that the number
of genotyped markers often greatly exceeds the sample size. We show using CS
methods and theory that all loci of nonzero effect can be identified (selected)
using an efficient algorithm, provided that they are sufficiently few in number
(sparse) relative to sample size. For heritability h2 = 1, there is a sharp
phase transition to complete selection as the sample size is increased. For
heritability values less than one, complete selection can still occur although
the transition is smoothed. The transition boundary is only weakly dependent on
the total number of genotyped markers. The crossing of a transition boundary
provides an objective means to determine when true effects are being recovered;
we discuss practical methods for detecting the boundary. For h2 = 0.5, we find
that a sample size that is thirty times the number of nonzero loci is
sufficient for good recovery.

Faraday effect was found in this frequency range to the limits of our

has appeared in many scientific disciplines over the last century. PhaseLift is
a recently introduced algorithm for phase recovery that is computationally
efficient, numerically stable, and comes with rigorous performance guarantees.
PhaseLift is optimal in the sense that the number of amplitude measurements
required for phase reconstruction scales linearly with the dimension of the
signal. However, it specifically demands Gaussian random measurement vectors -
a limitation that restricts practical utility and obscures the specific
properties of measurement ensembles that enable phase retrieval. Here we
present a partial derandomization of PhaseLift that only requires sampling from
certain polynomial size vector configurations, called t-designs. Such
configurations have been studied in algebraic combinatorics, coding theory, and
quantum information. We prove reconstruction guarantees for a number of
measurements that depends on the degree t of the design. If the degree is
allowed to to grow logarithmically with the dimension, the bounds become tight
up to polylog-factors. Beyond the specific case of PhaseLift, this work
highlights the utility of spherical designs for the derandomization of data
recovery schemes.

ensemble of particles with an arbitrary spin. Our conditions are formulated
with the first and second moments of the collective angular momentum
coordinates. A method for mapping the spin-squeezing inequalities for spin-1/2
particles to entanglement conditions for spin-j particles is also presented. We
apply our mapping to obtain a generalization of the original spin-squeezing
inequality to higher spins. We show that, for large particle numbers, a
spin-squeezing parameter for entanglement detection based on one of our
inequalities is strictly stronger than the original spin-squeezing parameter
defined in [A. Sorensen et al., Nature 409, 63 (2001)]. We present a coordinate
system independent form of our inequalities that contains, besides the
correlation and covariance tensors of the collective angular momentum
operators, the nematic tensor appearing in the theory of spin nematics.
Finally, we discuss how to measure the quantities appearing in our inequalities
in experiments.

problem, thereby making the application of high-performance computing

platforms are explored. The efficient computation of key risk measures,
including Probable Maximum Loss (PML) and the Tail Value-at-Risk (TVaR) in the
presence of both primary and secondary uncertainty for a portfolio of property
catastrophe insurance treaties is considered. Primary Uncertainty is the the
uncertainty associated with whether a catastrophe event occurs or not in a
simulated year, while Secondary Uncertainty is the uncertainty in the amount of
loss when the event occurs.
  A number of statistical algorithms are investigated for computing secondary
uncertainty. Numerous challenges such as loading large data onto hardware with
limited memory and organising it are addressed. The results obtained from
experimental studies are encouraging. Consider for example, an aggregate risk
analysis involving 800,000 trials, with 1,000 catastrophic events per trial, a
million locations, and a complex contract structure taking into account
secondary uncertainty. The analysis can be performed in just 41 seconds on a
GPU, that is 24x faster than the sequential counterpart on a fast multi-core
CPU. The results indicate that GPUs can be used to efficiently accelerate
aggregate risk analysis even in the presence of secondary uncertainty.

terminal in a lossy fashion, leading to the constrained reconstruction
constraint. A special case of constrained reconstruction is the common
reconstruction constraint, in which both terminals agree on the functions
computed with probability one. The terminals exchange information in multiple
rate constrained communication rounds. A characterization of the multi-round
rate-distortion region for the above problem with constrained reconstruction
constraints is provided. To gain more insights and to highlight the value of
interaction and order of communication, the rate-distortion region for
computing various functions of jointly Gaussian sources according to common
reconstruction constraints is studied.

The modulated back-scattered radar signal in the presence of high noise and

cyclostationary approach for such signals and show that by using non-linear

within a disc dead zone, a region about the disc midplane of a disc that is not
sufficiently ionised for the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) to drive
turbulence. In particular, we determine whether additional sources of
turbulence within a dead zone are capable of suppressing gravo-magneto (GM)
disc outbursts that arise from a rapid transition from gravitationally produced
to MRI produced turbulence. With viscous $\alpha$ disc models we consider two
mechanisms that may drive turbulence within the dead zone. First, we examine a
constant $\alpha$ parameter within the dead zone. This may be applicable to
hydrodynamical instability, such as baroclinic instability, where the
turbulence level is independent of the MRI active surface layer properties. In
this case, we find that the disc will not become stable to the outbursts unless
the dead zone turbulent viscosity is comparable to that in the MRI active
surface layers. Under such conditions, the accretion rate through the dead zone
must be larger than that through the MRI active layers. In a second model, we
assume that the accretion flow though the dead zone is a constant fraction
(less than unity) of that through the active layers. This may be applicable to
turbulence driven by hydrodynamic waves that are excited by the MRI active
surface layers. We find that the instability is hardly affected by the viscous
dead zone. In both cases however, we find that the triggering of the MRI during
the outburst may be due to the heating from the viscosity in the dead zone,
rather than self-gravity. Thus, neither mechanism for generating turbulence
within the dead zone can significantly stabilise a disc or the resulting
outburst behaviour.

Ia) is sufficiently both distinct and common to be classified separately from
the bulk of SNe Ia, with a suggested class name of ""type Iax supernovae"" (SNe
Iax), after SN 2002cx. However, their progenitors are still uncertain. We study
whether the population properties of this class might be understood if the
events originate from a subset of sub-Chandrasekhar mass explosions. In this
potential progenitor population, a carbon--oxygen white dwarf (CO WD)
accumulates a helium layer from a non-degenerate helium star; ignition of that
helium layer then leads to ignition of the CO WD. We incorporated detailed
binary evolution calculations for the progenitor systems into a binary
population synthesis model to obtain rates and delay times for such events. The
predicted Galactic event rate of these explosions is ~1.5\times10^{-3}{yr}^{-1}
according to our standard model, in good agreement with the measured rates of
SNe Iax. In addition, predicted delay times are ~70Myr-800Myr, consistent with
the fact that most of SNe Iax have been discovered in late-type galaxies. If
the explosions are assumed to be double-detonations -- following current model
expectations -- then based on the CO WD masses at explosion we also estimate
the distribution of resulting SN brightness (-13 \gtrsim M_{bol} \gtrsim
-19mag), which can reproduce the empirical diversity of SNe Iax. We speculate
on why binaries with non-degenerate donor stars might lead to SNe Iax if
similar systems with degenerate donors do not. We suggest that the high mass of
the helium layer necessary for ignition at the lower accretion rates typically
delivered from non-degenerate donors might be necessary to produce SN
2002cx-like characteristics, perhaps even by changing the nature of the CO
ignition.

on iterative calls to a SAT solver. Preprocessing is crucial for the
acceleration of SAT solving, and the key preprocessing techniques rely on the
application of resolution and subsumption elimination. Additionally,
satisfiability-preserving clause elimination procedures are often used. Since
MaxSAT computation typically involves a large number of SAT calls, we are
interested in whether an input instance to a MaxSAT problem can be preprocessed
up-front, i.e. prior to running the MaxSAT solver, rather than (or, in addition
to) during each iterative SAT solver call. The key requirement in this setting
is that the preprocessing has to be sound, i.e. so that the solution can be
reconstructed correctly and efficiently after the execution of a MaxSAT
algorithm on the preprocessed instance. While, as we demonstrate in this paper,
certain clause elimination procedures are sound for MaxSAT, it is well-known
that this is not the case for resolution and subsumption elimination. In this
paper we show how to adapt these preprocessing techniques to MaxSAT. To achieve
this we recast the MaxSAT problem in a recently introduced labelled-CNF
framework, and show that within the framework the preprocessing techniques can
be applied soundly. Furthermore, we show that MaxSAT algorithms restated in the
framework have a natural implementation on top of an incremental SAT solver. We
evaluate the prototype implementation of a MaxSAT algorithm WMSU1 in this

improvement with respect to non-incremental versions of the algorithm on some

interpreters that is particularly effective for executing dynamically typed
programming languages. The key idea is to combine speculative staging of
optimized interpreter instructions with a novel technique of incrementally and
iteratively concerting them at run-time.
  This paper introduces the concepts behind deriving optimized instructions
from existing interpreter instructions---incrementally peeling off layers of
complexity. When compiling the interpreter, these optimized derivatives will be
compiled along with the original interpreter instructions. Therefore, our
technique is portable by construction since it leverages the existing
compiler's backend. At run-time we use instruction substitution from the
interpreter's original and expensive instructions to optimized instruction
derivatives to speed up execution.
  Our technique unites high performance with the simplicity and portability of
interpreters---we report that our optimization makes the CPython interpreter up
to more than four times faster, where our interpreter closes the gap between
and sometimes even outperforms PyPy's just-in-time compiler.

WISE W1 (3.4-micron) band, 16 in W2 (4.6-micron), 3 in W3 (12-micron) and 0 in
W4 (22-micron). This is particularly important with Spitzer in its warm-mission
phase and no faint follow-up capability at wavelengths longwards of 5 microns
until the launch of JWST. WISE thus provides a useful tool for understanding
QSOs found in forthcoming large-area optical/IR sky surveys, using PanSTARRS,
SkyMapper, VISTA, DES and LSST. The rest-UV properties of the WISE-detected and
the WISE-non-detected samples differ: the detections have brighter i/z-band
magnitudes and redder rest-UV colors. This suggests that a more aggressive hunt
for very-high-redshift QSOs, by combining WISE W1 and W2 data with red observed
optical colors could be effective at least for a subset of dusty candidate
QSOs. Stacking the WISE images of the WISE-non-detected QSOs indicates that
they are on average significantly fainter than the WISE-detected examples, and
are thus not narrowly missing detection in the WISE catalog. The WISE-catalog
detection of three of our sample in the W3 band indicates that their mid-IR
flux can be detected individually, although there is no stacked W3 detection of
sources detected in W1 but not W3. Stacking analyses of WISE data for large AGN

up where Holst and Tsogtgerel left off, addressing the general non-CMC case for
compact manifolds with boundary. As in our previous articles, our focus here is
again on low regularity data and on the interaction between different types of

solution theory for the compact with boundary case, we also develop several
technical tools that have potential for use with the asymptotically Euclidean

fixed-node errors between the first- vs second-row systems for
single-configuration trial wave functions in quantum Monte Carlo calculations.
This significant difference in the fixed-node biases is studied across a set of
atoms, molecules, and also Si, C solid crystals. The analysis is done over
valence isoelectronic systems that share similar correlation energies, bond
patterns, geometries, ground states, and symmetries. We show that the key
features which affect the fixed-node errors are the differences in electron
density and the degree of node nonlinearity. The findings reveal how the
accuracy of the quantum Monte Carlo varies across a variety of systems, provide
new perspectives on the origins of the fixed-node biases in electronic
structure calculations of molecular and condensed systems, and carry
implications for pseudopotential constructions for heavy elements

(GW) data from three interferometer detectors were analyzed within minutes to
select GW candidate events and infer their apparent sky positions. Target
coordinates were transmitted to several telescopes for follow-up observations
aimed at the detection of an associated optical transient. Images were obtained
for eight such GW candidates. We present the methods used to analyze the image
data as well as the transient search results. No optical transient was
identified with a convincing association with any of these candidates, and none
of the GW triggers showed strong evidence for being astrophysical in nature. We
compare the sensitivities of these observations to several model light curves

BABAR Collaboration, but there seems still open question of this assignment:
why its full width is so narrow? To answer this question, we calculate the
Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka (OZI) allowed strong decays $X(3915)\to D \bar D$, where
X(3915) is assigned as a $\chi_{c0}(2P)$ state, and estimate its full width in
the cooperating framework of $^3/!P_0^{}$ model and the Bethe-Salpeter (BS)
method using the Mandelstam Formalism, during which non-perturbative QCD
effects of the hadronic matrix elements are well considered by overlapping
integral over the relativistic Salpeter wave functions of the initial and
finial states. We find the node structure of $\chi_{c0}(2P)$ wave function
resulting in the narrow width of X(3915) and show the dependence of the decay
width on the variation of the initial mass of X(3915). We point out that the
rate of $\frac{\Gamma(X(3915)\to D^+ D^-)}{\Gamma(X(3915)\to D^0 \bar D^0)}$ is
crucial to confirm whether X(3915) is the $\chi_{c0}(2P)$ state or not.

infinitesimal $r$ and $g$. For practical parameters with $r=g=10\,\mathrm{nm}$,
the mode area of opposing apex-to-apex fan-shaped waveguides can be as small as
$4\times10^{-3}A_{0}$ ($A_{0}=\lambda^{2}/4$), far beyond the diffraction
limit. This way of breaking diffraction limit with no loss outperforms
plasmonic waveguides, where light confinement is realized at the cost of huge
intrinsic loss in the metal. Furthermore, we propose a structure with
dielectric bow-tie antenna on a silicon-on-insulator waveguide, whose field
enhancement increases by one order. The lossless dielectric corner and gap

key issue of whether and how such a current can be utilized to drive and
control information stored in magnetic domain walls (DWs) is still outstanding

DWs separation dynamics and picosecond magnetization reversal. In addition,
long-range ($\sim$ mm) antiferromagnetic DWs coupling emerges. If one DW is
pinned by geometric constriction, the spin current induces a dynamical spin
orbital interaction that triggers an internal electric field determined by
$\vec{E} \sim \hat{e}_{x} \cdot (\vec{n}_{1} \times \vec{n}_{2})$ where
$\vec{n}_{1/2}$ are the effective DWs orientations and $\hat{e}_{x} $ is their

equation is conducted for all values of the parameters of the equation. When
solutions are recurrent, we show that the autocovariance function of the

asymptotically equal to another asymptotically stationary process whose
autocovariance function decays exponentially. It is shown that when solutions
grow, they do so at either a polynomial or exponential rate in time depending

sets. On these exceptional sets, solutions are recurrent on the real line with
large fluctuations consistent with the Law of the Iterated logarithm, or

wireless users, who have greater and more diverse quality of service (QoS)
demands than ever before. However, the amount of spectrum that can be used to
satisfy these demands remains finite. This leads to a great challenge for
wireless users to effectively share the spectrum to achieve their QoS
requirements. This paper presents a game theoretic model for spectrum sharing,
where users seek to satisfy their QoS demands in a distributed fashion. Our
spectrum sharing model is quite general, because we allow different wireless
channels to provide different QoS, depending upon their channel conditions and
how many users are trying to access them. Also, users can be highly
heterogeneous, with different QoS demands, depending upon their activities,
hardware capabilities, and technology choices. Under such a general setting, we
show that it is NP hard to find a spectrum allocation which satisfies the
maximum number of users' QoS requirements in a centralized fashion. We also
show that allowing users to self-organize through distributed channel
selections is a viable alternative to the centralized optimization, because
better response updating is guaranteed to reach a pure Nash equilibria in
polynomial time. By bounding the price of anarchy, we demonstrate that the
worst case pure Nash equilibrium can be close to optimal, when users and
channels are not very heterogenous. We also extend our model by considering the
frequency spatial reuse, and consider the user interactions as a game upon a
graph where players only contend with their neighbors. We prove that better
response updating is still guaranteed to reach a pure Nash equilibrium in this
more general spatial QoS satisfaction game.

suffices to explain the observed non--trivial values of $\alpha$: a random

when fed to an element with such a response function $R$ gives an output
$R(S(t))$ that can have a power spectrum $1/f^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha <

Mo atomic-plane glides, and requires an intermediate phase ({\alpha}-phase) as
an indispensable precursor. Migration of two kinds of boundaries ({\beta} and
{\gamma}-boundaries) is also found to be responsible for the growth of the
second phase. The 1T phase can be intentionally introduced in the 2H matrix by
using a high dose of incident electron beam during heating the MoS2

Ding's original strategy, by blowing down the metric, using Cheeger and
Colding's theory about limit spaces of Gromov-Hausdorff convergence, combining
with the Gaussian upper bound of heat kernel on limit spaces, we succeed in
reducing the limit behavior of the heat kernel on manifold to the values of
heat kernels on tangent cones at infinity of manifold with renormalized
measure. As one application, we get the consistent large time limit of heat
kernel in more general context, which generalizes the former result of P. Li.

we show the first example manifold whose heat kernel has inconsistent limit
behavior, which answers an open question posed by P. Li negatively.

phenomena. Among them, powerful bursts of gravitational waves (GWs) produced by
cusps are a promising observational signature. In this Letter we present a
search for GWs from cosmic string cusps in data collected by the LIGO and Virgo
gravitational wave detectors between 2005 and 2010, with over 625 days of live
time. We find no evidence of GW signals from cosmic strings. From this result,
we derive new constraints on cosmic string parameters, which complement and
improve existing limits from previous searches for a stochastic background of
GWs from cosmic microwave background measurements and pulsar timing data. In
particular, if the size of loops is given by the gravitational backreaction
scale, we place upper limits on the string tension $G\mu$ below $10^{-8}$ in
some regions of the cosmic string parameter space.

connectivity with only topological knowledge at the transmitters is considered.
The network has a Wyner-type channel flavor, i.e., for each connectivity state
the receivers observe at most one interference signal in addition to their
desired signal. Degrees of freedom (DoF) upper bounds and lower bounds are
derived. The lower bounds are obtained from a scheme based on joint encoding
across the alternating states. Given a uniform distribution among the
connectivity states, it is shown that the channel has 2+ 1/9 DoF. This provides
an increase in the DoF as compared to encoding over each state separately,
which achieves 2 DoF only.

Chudak and Shmoys combined with a primal-dual algorithm of Jain et al. In this
paper we first give a simple interpretation of this randomization process in
terms of solving an aux- iliary (factor revealing) LP. Then, armed with this
simple view point, Abstract. we exercise the randomization on a more
complicated algorithm for the k-level version of the problem with penalties in
which the planner has the option to pay a penalty instead of connecting chosen

Tutte's reduction to the matching problem. By the same reduction, it is easy to
find a minimal or maximal d-factor of a graph. However, if we require that the
d-factor is connected, these problems become NP-hard - finding a minimal
connected 2-factor is just the traveling salesman problem (TSP).
  Given a complete graph with edge weights that satisfy the triangle
inequality, we consider the problem of finding a minimal connected $d$-factor.
We give a 3-approximation for all $d$ and improve this to an
(r+1)-approximation for even d, where r is the approximation ratio of the TSP.
This yields a 2.5-approximation for even d. The same algorithm yields an
(r+1)-approximation for the directed version of the problem, where r is the
approximation ratio of the asymmetric TSP. We also show that none of these
minimization problems can be approximated better than the corresponding TSP.
  Finally, for the decision problem of deciding whether a given graph contains
a connected d-factor, we extend known hardness results.

the blue straggler star (BSS) population of the Galactic globular cluster NGC
362. We have found two distinct sequences of BSS: this is the second case,
after M 30, where such a feature has been observed. Indeed the BSS location,
their extension in magnitude and color and their radial distribution within the
cluster nicely resemble those observed in M 30, thus suggesting that the same
interpretative scenario can be applied: the red BSS sub-population is generated
by mass transfer binaries, the blue one by collisions. The discovery of four
new W UMa stars, three of which lying along the red-BSS sequence, further
supports this scenario. We also found that the inner portion of the density
profile deviates from a King model and is well reproduced by either a mild
power-law (\alpha -0.2) or a double King profile. This feature supports the
hypothesis that the cluster is currently undergoing the core collapse phase.
Moreover, the BSS radial distribution shows a central peak and monotonically
decreases outward without any evidence of an external rising branch. This
evidence is a further indication of the advanced dynamical age of NGC 362: in
fact, together with M 30, NGC 362 belongs to the family of dynamically old
clusters (Family III) in the ""dynamical clock"" classification proposed by
Ferraro et al. (2012). The observational evidence presented here strengthens
the possible connection between the existence of a double BSS sequence and a
quite advanced dynamical status of the parent cluster.

drive suspensions of protein filaments far from thermodynamic equilibrium,
leading to exotic dynamics and pattern formation. Microscopic modelling can
help to quantify the relationship between individual motors plus filaments to
organisation and dynamics on molecular and supra-molecular length scales. Here
we present results of extensive numerical simulations of active gels where the
motors and filaments are confined between two infinite parallel plates. Thermal
fluctuations and excluded-volume interactions between filaments are included. A
systematic variation of rates for motor motion, attachment and detachment,
including a differential detachment rate from filament ends, reveals a range of
non-equilibrium behaviour. Strong motor binding produces structured filament
aggregates that we refer to as asters, bundles or layers, whose stability
depends on motor speed and differential end-detachment. The gross features of
the dependence of the observed structures on the motor rate and the filament
concentration can be captured by a simple one-filament model. Loosely bound
aggregates exhibit super-diffusive mass transport, where filament translocation
scales with lag time with non-unique exponents that depend on motor kinetics.
An empirical data collapse of filament speed as a function of motor speed and
end-detachment is found, suggesting a dimensional reduction of the relevant
parameter space. We conclude by discussing the perspectives of microscopic

other molecular species, sampling excitation energies from a few tens to a few
thousand K. These observations are part of the Herschel Guaranteed Time Key
Program HIFISTARS. We detected the J=6-5, J=10-9, and J=16-15 lines of 12CO and
13CO at about 100, 300, and 750K above the ground state (and the 13CO J=9-8
line). These lines are crucial for improving the modelling of the internal
layers of the envelope around VY CMa. We also detected 27 lines of H2O and its
isotopomers, and 96 lines of species such as NH3, SiO, SO, SO2 HCN, OH and
others, some of them originating from vibrationally excited levels. Three lines
were not unambiguously assigned. Our observations confirm that VY CMa's
envelope must consist of two or more detached components. The molecular
excitation in the outer layers is significantly lower than in the inner ones,
resulting in strong self-absorbed profiles in molecular lines that are
optically thick in this outer envelope, for instance, low-lying lines of H2O.
Except for the most abundant species, CO and H2O, most of the molecular
emission detected at these sub-mm/FIR wavelengths arise from the central parts
of the envelope. The spectrum of VY CMa is very prominent in vibrationally
excited lines, which are caused by the strong IR pumping present in the central
regions. Compared with envelopes of other massive evolved stars, VY CMa's
emission is particularly strong in these vibrationally excited lines, as well
as in the emission from less abundant species such as H13CN, SO, and NH3.

latent topic representations. However, existing RTMs have limitations in both
the restricted model expressiveness and incapability of dealing with imbalanced

this paper presents three extensions: 1) unlike the common link likelihood with
a diagonal weight matrix that allows the-same-topic interactions only, we
generalize it to use a full weight matrix that captures all pairwise topic
interactions and is applicable to asymmetric networks; 2) instead of doing
standard Bayesian inference, we perform regularized Bayesian inference
(RegBayes) with a regularization parameter to deal with the imbalanced link
structure issue in common real networks and improve the discriminative ability
of learned latent representations; and 3) instead of doing variational
approximation with strict mean-field assumptions, we present collapsed Gibbs
sampling algorithms for the generalized relational topic models by exploring
data augmentation without making restricting assumptions. Under the generic
RegBayes framework, we carefully investigate two popular discriminative loss
functions, namely, the logistic log-loss and the max-margin hinge loss.
Experimental results on several real network datasets demonstrate the
significance of these extensions on improving the prediction performance, and

after photobleaching. Here, we report a novel approach to study how proteins
traffic to and from the immune synapse using NK cell receptors tagged with the
photoswitchable fluorescent protein tdEosFP, which can be irreversibly
photoswitched from a green to red fluorescent state by ultraviolet light. Thus,
following a localized switching event, the movement of the photoswitched
molecules can be temporally and spatially resolved by monitoring fluorescence
in two regions of interest. By comparing images with mathematical models, we
evaluated the diffusion coefficient of the receptor KIR2DL1 (0.23 +- 0.06
micron^2/s) and assessed how synapse formation affects receptor dynamics. Our
data conclude that the inhibitory NK cell receptor KIR2DL1 is continually
trafficked into the synapse and remains surprisingly stable there. Unexpectedly
however, in NK cells forming synapses with multiple target cells
simultaneously, KIR2DL1 at one synapse can relocate to another synapse. Thus,
our results reveal a previously undetected inter-synaptic exchange of protein.

many issues. Due to the effects of discretization, the required properties of

specific skeletonization algorithm depends on the application. This allows to
classify the desired properties by order of importance, and tend towards the
most critical ones. Our goal is to make a skeleton dedicated to shape matching
for recognition. So, the discrete skeleton has to be thin - so that it can be
represented by a graph -, robust to noise, reversible - so that the initial
shape can be fully reconstructed - and homotopic to the shape. We propose a
linear-time skeletonization algorithm based on the squared Euclidean distance
map from which we extract the maximal balls and ridges. After a thinning and

associating their excess DM with the intergalactic medium, we relate it to a

W-UMa-type contact binary. Analysis of our data outside of the FRB beams
indicates a 5% chance probability of finding a variable star of this brightness

they have the required positivity property to lead to a convergent LVE; in

Five early-type and eccentric-orbit eclipsing binaries: HV 982 (P = 5.34 d, e =

that the formalism of quantum theory is incomplete. It then goes through the

is proposed an alternative reading of this history, showing that modern

to cognitive functions, such as perception, attention, and memory. It is
therefore important to determine which properties of neurons influence their
collective behavior in a network and to understand how. A prominent feature of
many cortical neurons is spike frequency adaptation, which is caused by slow
transmembrane currents. We investigated how these adaptation currents affect
the synchronization tendency of coupled model neurons. Using the efficient
adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire (aEIF) model and a biophysically
detailed neuron model for validation, we found that increased adaptation
currents promote synchronization of coupled excitatory neurons at lower spike
frequencies, as long as the conduction delays between the neurons are
negligible. Inhibitory neurons on the other hand synchronize in presence of
conduction delays, with or without adaptation currents. Our results emphasize
the utility of the aEIF model for computational studies of neuronal network
dynamics. We conclude that adaptation currents provide a mechanism to generate
low frequency oscillations in local populations of excitatory neurons, while
faster rhythms seem to be caused by inhibition rather than excitation.

  Systems","Submitted to Journal of Automated Software Engineering",,,,"cs.LO cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a verification methodology for analysing the decision-making
component in agent-based hybrid systems. Traditionally hybrid automata have
been used to both implement and verify such systems, but hybrid automata based
modelling, programming and verification techniques scale poorly as the
complexity of discrete decision-making increases making them unattractive in
situations where complex logical reasoning is required. In the programming of
complex systems it has, therefore, become common to separate out logical
decision-making into a separate, discrete, component. However, verification
techniques have failed to keep pace with this development. We are exploring
agent-based logical components and have developed a model checking technique
for such components which can then be composed with a separate analysis of the
continuous part of the hybrid system. Among other things this allows program
model checkers to be used to verify the actual implementation of the
decision-making in hybrid autonomous systems.

stars per year. In contrast to elliptical galaxies, which are largely devoid of
star formation, star formation is still going on in spiral galaxies because of
their reservoirs of molecular gas, the fuel for new stars. The discs of spiral
galaxies are comprised not only of stars as we clearly see from Earth, but also
gas (the interstellar medium, ISM). This is where this gas accumulates into
cold, dense, molecular regions known as molecular clouds, in which new stars
are formed. Most star formation occurs in massive molecular clouds, known as
giant molecular clouds (GMCs). However, while we have a good understanding of
how individual stars form, there is less consensus on how their natal clouds of
gas accumulate, how long these clouds last, how star formation progresses over
their lifetime, and indeed how star formation has progressed over the lifetime
of the Milky Way.

social networks, the interest in studies of influence propagation through
networks is higher than ever. In a viral marketing campaign, a firm initially
targets a small set of pioneers and hopes that they would influence a sizeable
fraction of the population by diffusion of influence through the network. In
general, any marketing campaign might fail to go viral in the first try. As
such, it would be useful to have some guide to evaluate the effectiveness of
the campaign and judge whether it is worthy of further resources, and in case
the campaign has potential, how to hit upon a good pioneer who can make the
campaign go viral. In this paper, we present a diffusion model developed by
enriching the generalized random graph (a.k.a. configuration model) to provide
insight into these questions. We offer the intuition behind the results on this
model, rigorously proved in Blaszczyszyn & Gaurav(2013), and illustrate them
here by taking examples of random networks having prototypical degree
distributions - Poisson degree distribution, which is commonly used as a kind
of benchmark, and Power Law degree distribution, which is normally used to
approximate the real-world networks. On these networks, the members are assumed
to have varying attitudes towards propagating the information. We analyze three
cases, in particular - (1) Bernoulli transmissions, when a member influences
each of its friend with probability p; (2) Node percolation, when a member
influences all its friends with probability p and none with probability 1-p;
(3) Coupon-collector transmissions, when a member randomly selects one of his
friends K times with replacement. We assume that the configuration model is the
closest approximation of a large online social network, when the information
available about the network is very limited. The key insight offered by this
study from a firm's perspective is regarding how to evaluate the effectiveness
of a marketing campaign and do cost-benefit analysis by collecting relevant
statistical data from the pioneers it selects. The campaign evaluation
criterion is informed by the observation that if the parameters of the
underlying network and the campaign effectiveness are such that the campaign
can indeed reach a significant fraction of the population, then the set of good
pioneers also forms a significant fraction of the population. Therefore, in
such a case, the firms can even adopt the naive strategy of repeatedly picking
and targeting some number of pioneers at random from the population. With this
strategy, the probability of them picking a good pioneer will increase
geometrically fast with the number of tries.

Small magnetic elements, at or below the current spatial resolution achieved by
modern solar telescopes, are though to play a relevant role in the energy
budget of the upper layers of the Sun's atmosphere, as they are found to cover
a significant fraction of the solar photosphere. Unfortunately, the limited
temporal length and/or cadence of the data sets, or the presence of
seeing-induced effects have prevented, so far, the estimation of the power
spectra of kink-like oscillations in small magnetic elements with good
accuracy. Motivated by this, we studied kink-like oscillations in small

acquired with the Solar Optical Telescope on board the Hinode satellite. In
this work we present the results of this analysis, by studying the power
spectral density of kink-like oscillations on a statistical basis. We found

widely used classes of error-correcting codes. In this thesis we study and
compare two major strategies known for their decoding procedure, the
Peterson-Gorenstein-Zierler (PGZ) and the Berlekamp-Massey (BM) decoder, in
order to improve existing decoding algorithms and propose faster new ones. In
particular we study a modified version of the PGZ decoder, which we will call
the fast Peterson-Gorenstein-Zierler (fPGZ) decoding algorithm. This
improvement was presented in 1997 by exploiting the Hankel structure of the
syndrome matrix. In this thesis we show that the fPGZ decoding algorithm can be
seen as a particular case of the BM one. Indeed we prove that the intermediate
outcomes obtained in the implementation of fPGZ are a subset of those of the BM
decoding algorithm. In this way, we also uncover the existing relationship
between the leading principal minors of syndrome matrix and the discrepancies
computed by the BM algorithm. Finally, thanks to the study done on the
structure of the syndrome matrix and its leading principal minors, we improve
the error value computation in both the decoding strategies studied
(specifically we prove new error value formulas for the fPGZ and the BM
decoding algorithm) and moreover we state a new iterative formulation of the
PGZ decoder well suited to a parallel implementation on integrated microchips.
Thus using techniques of linear algebra we obtain a parallel decoding algorithm
for Reed-Solomon codes with an O(e) computational time complexity, where e is
the number of errors which occurred, although a fairly large number of
elementary circuit elements is needed.

and apply a coverage criterion (e.g. pairwise feature interaction or
dissimilarity) to generate tractable, fault-finding, lists of configurations to
be tested. Prioritization can also be used to sort/generate such lists,
optimizing coverage criteria or weights assigned to features. However, current
sampling/prioritization techniques barely take product behavior into account.
We explore how ideas of statistical testing, based on a usage model (a Markov

regime of strong magnetization and very high compactness (l ~10^3-10^8).
Heating is applied at a low effective temperature (< 25 keV), and the fireball
is allowed to expand, so that the formation of a black-body spectral
distribution is inhibited by pair annihilation. The diffusion equation for
Compton scattering is coupled to a single-temperature pair gas and an exact
(trans-relativistic) cyclo-synchrotron photon source. We find that the photon
spectrum develops a quasi-thermal peak, with a power-law slope below it that is
characteristic of gamma-ray bursts. The formation of a thermal high-frequency
spectrum is checked using the full kinetic equations at l ~ 10^3. These results
have several implications for the central engine of GRBs, and the mechanism of
energy transport. 1. Baryon rest mass carries less than ~ 10^{-5} of the energy
flux at jet breakout inside ~ 10^{12} cm from the engine, with most carried by
the magnetic field. 2. This degree of baryon purity points to the presence of
an event horizon in the engine, and neutrons play a negligible role in the
prompt emission mechanism. 3. X-ray flashes are emitted by outflows carrying
enough baryons that the photosphere is pair-depleted, which we show results in
faster thermalization. 4. The relation between observed peak frequency and
burst luminosity is bounded below by the observed Amati et al. relation if jet
Lorentz factor ~ 1/(opening angle) at breakout. 5. Stellar models are used to
demonstrate an inconsistency between the highest observed GRB energies, and a
hydrodynamic nozzle: magnetic collimation is required. 6. The magnetized pair
gas is dilute enough that high-frequency Alfven waves may become charge
starved. Finally, we suggest that limitations on magnetic reconnection from
plasma collisionality have been overestimated.

discussed, with an emphasis on how the dominant dissipative mode and the

high optical depth are a potentially important source of Compton seeds. Their
characteristic energy is bounded below by ~1 MeV in pair-loaded outflows of
relatively low compactness, and remains near ~1 MeV at very high compactness
and low matter loading. This is compared with the characteristic energy of O(1)
MeV observed in the rest frame spectra of many sources, including gamma-ray
bursts, OSSE jet sources, MeV Blazars, and the intense initial 0.1 s pulse of
the March 5 event. Additional topics discussed include the feedback of pair
creation on electron heating and the formation of non-thermal spectra, their
effectiveness at shielding the dissipative zone from ambient photons, direct
Compton damping of irregularities in the outflow, the relative importance of
various soft photon sources, and the softening of the emergent spectrum that
results from heavy matter loading. The implications of this work for X-ray and
optical afterglow from GRB's are briefly considered. Direct synchrotron
emission behind the forward shock is inhibited by the extremely low energy
density of the ambient magnetic field. Mildly relativistic ejecta off axis from
the main gamma-ray emitting cone become optically thin to scattering on a

one of the main issues in quantum chaos (or wave chaos), and thus plays an
important role in general quantum mechanics or even in general wave mechanics.
In this work we propose two different localization measures characterizing the
degree of quantum localization, and study their relation to another fundamental
aspect of quantum chaos, namely the (energy) spectral statistics. Our approach
and method is quite general, and we apply it to billiard systems. One of the
signatures of the localization of chaotic eigenstates is a fractional power-law
repulsion between the nearest energy levels in the sense that the probability
density to find successive levels on a distance $S$ goes like $\propto S^\beta$
for small $S$, where $0 \leq \beta \leq 1$, and $\beta = 1$ corresponds to
completely extended states. We show that there is a clear functional relation
between the exponent {\beta} and the two different localization measures. One
is based on the information entropy and the other one on the correlation
properties of the Husimi functions. We show that the two definitions are
surprisingly linearly equivalent. The approach is applied in the case of a
mixed-type billiard system (Robnik 1983), in which the separation of regular
and chaotic eigenstates is performed.

There are many applications of WSNs, including environmental monitoring,

particular aspects of WSNs (Networking, or Signal Processing, or Embedded

Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences. This paper gives two original
contributions: the essential knowledge that should be brought in a WSNs course
is characterized, and a course structure with an harmonious holistic approach
is proposed. A method based on both theory and experiments is illustrated for
the design of this course, whereby the students have hands-on to implement,
understand, and develop in practice the implications of theoretical concepts.
Theory and applications are thus considered all together. Ultimately, the
objective of this paper is to design a new course, to use innovative hands-on
experiments to illustrate the theoretical concepts in the course, to show that
theoretical aspects are essential for the solution of real-life engineering
WSNs problems, and finally to create a fun and interesting teaching and
learning environments for WSNs.

defects. Defects often play a central role in ionic and electronic solids, not
only to limit reliability, but more importantly to enable the functionalities
that make these materials of critical importance. Examples include solid
electrolytes that conduct current through the motion of charged point defects,
and complex oxide ferroelectrics that display multifunctionality through the
motion of domain wall defects. Therefore, it is important to understand the
structure of defects and their response to electrical and mechanical fields. A
central hurdle, however, is that interactions in ionic solids include both
short-range atomic interactions as well as long-range electrostatic
interactions. Existing atomistic-to-continuum multi-scale methods, such as the
Quasicontinuum method, are applicable only when the atomic interactions are
short-range. In addition, empirical reductions of quantum mechanics to density
functional models are unable to capture key phenomena of interest in these
materials. To address this open problem, we develop a multiscale atomistic
method to coarse-grain the long-range electrical interactions in ionic crystals
with defects. In these settings, the charge density is rapidly varying, but in
an almost-periodic manner. The key idea is to use the polarization density
field as a multiscale mediator that enables efficient coarse-graining by
exploiting the almost-periodic nature of the variation. In regions far from the
defect, where the crystal is close-to-perfect, the polarization field serves as
a proxy that enables us to avoid accounting for the details of the charge
variation. We combine this approach for long-range electrostatics with the
standard Quasicontinuum method for short-range interactions to achieve an
efficient multiscale atomistic-to-continuum method.

Solar maps of the Sun at 17 GHz are used as a proxy for the stellar eclipse by
several sizes of planets from Super-Earths to Hot Jupiters. The relative depth
at mid transit is the same as observed at visible wavelengths, but the limb
brightening of the stellar disk at 17 GHz is clearly seen in the shape of the
transit light curve. Moreover, when the planet occults an active region the
depth of the transit decreases even further, depending on the brightness of the
active region relative to the surrounding disk. For intense active region, with
50 times the brightness temperature of the surrounding disk, the decrease can
supersede the unperturbed transit depth depending on the size of the eclipsing
planet. For a Super-Earth (R_p=0.02 R_s) crossing, the decrease in intensity is
0.04%, increasing to 0.86% in the case when a strong active region is present.
On the other hand, for a hot Jupiter with R_p=0.17 R_s, the unperturbed transit
depth is 3% increasing to 4.7% when covering this strong active region. This
kind of behavior can be verified with observation of planetary transits with
the ALMA radio interferometer.

general coordinate invariance as well as invariance under local spin-base

spacetime-dependent Dirac matrices subject to the Clifford-algebra constraint.
In particular, a coframe, i.e. vierbein field is not required. The
corresponding affine spin connection consists of a canonical part that is
completely fixed in terms of the Dirac matrices and a free part that can be
interpreted as spin torsion. A general variation of the Dirac matrices
naturally induces a spinorial Lie derivative which coincides with the known
Kosmann-Lie derivative in the absence of torsion. Using this formulation for
building a field theory of quantized gravity and matter fields, we show that it
suffices to quantize the metric and the matter fields. This observation is of
particular relevance for field theory approaches to quantum gravity, as it can
serve for a purely metric-based quantization scheme for gravity even in the

kinetics on any arbitrary dust-grain morphology, as determined by the
user-defined positions of each individual dust-grain atom. A simple method is
devised for the determination of the most likely diffusion pathways and their
associated energy barriers for surface species. The model is applied to a
small, idealized dust grain, adopting various gas densities and using a small
chemical network. Hydrogen and oxygen atoms accrete onto the grain, to produce
H2O, H2, O2 and H2O2. The off-lattice method allows the ice structure to evolve
freely; ice mantle porosity is found to be dependent on the gas density, which
controls the accretion rate. A gas density of 2 x 10^{4} cm^{-3}, appropriate
to dark interstellar clouds, is found to produce a fairly smooth and non-porous
ice mantle. At all densities, H2 molecules formed on the grains collect within
the crevices that divide nodules of ice, and within micropores (whose extreme
inward curvature produces strong local potential minima). The larger pores
produced in the high-density models are not typically filled with H2. Direct
deposition of water molecules onto the grain indicates that amorphous ices
formed in this way may be significantly more porous than interstellar ices that
are formed by surface chemistry.

Here, we theoretically study the coherent backaction of such a measurement on a

ensemble-averaged state of the SQD-qubit system, expressed in the coupled
dynamics of two charge-state occupations of the SQD and two qubit isospin
vectors, one for each SQD charge state. We find that aside from introducing
dissipation, the detection also renormalizes the coherent evolution of the
SQD-qubit system. Basically, if the electron on the detector has time to probe
the qubit, then it also has time to fluctuate and thereby renormalize the
system parameters. In particular, this induces torques on the qubit isospins,
similar to the spin torque generated by the spintronic exchange field in
noncollinear spin-valve structures. Secondly, we show that for a consistent
description of the detection, one must also include the renormalization effects
in the next-to-leading order in the electron tunneling rates, especially at the
point of maximal sensitivity of the detector. Although we focus on a
charge-qubit model, our findings are generic for qubit readout schemes that are
based on spin-to-charge conversion using a quantum-dot detector. Furthermore,
our study of the stationary current through the SQD, a test measurement
verifying that the qubit couples to the detector current, already reveals
various significant effects of the isospin torques on the qubit. Our kinetic
equations provide a starting point for further studies of the time evolution in
charge-based qubit readout. Finally, we provide a rigorous sum rule that
constrains such approximate descriptions of the qubit isospin dynamics and show
that it is obeyed by our kinetic equations.

physical stimuli such as variations in external temperature, stiffness of the
growth substrate, or topographical guidance cues. Detailed knowledge of the
mechanisms that control these biomechanical responses is necessary for
understanding the basic principles that underlie neuronal growth and
regeneration. Here, we present elasticity maps of living cortical neurons
(embryonic rat) as a function of temperature, and correlate these maps to the
locations of internal structural components of the cytoskeleton. Neurons
display a significant increase in the average elastic modulus upon a decrease
in ambient temperature from 37{\deg}C to 25{\deg}C. We demonstrate that the
dominant mechanism by which the elasticity of the neurons changes in response
to temperature is the stiffening of the actin components of the cytoskeleton
induced by myosin II. We also report a reversible shift in the location and
composition of the high-stiffness areas of the neuron cytoskeleton with
temperature. At 37{\deg}C the areas of the cell displaying high elastic modulus
overlap with the tubulin-dense regions, while at 25{\deg}C these high-stiffness
areas correspond to the actin-dense regions of the cytoskeleton. These results
demonstrate the importance of considering temperature effects when
investigating cytoskeletal dynamics in cells.

emission lines conducted with the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer on 22-23,
28 October and 4, 5 November 2010 at 1.1, 1.9 and 3.4 mm wavelengths. The
thermal emission from the dust coma and nucleus is detected simultaneously.
Interferometric images with unprecedented spatial resolution are obtained. A
sine-wave variation of the thermal continuum is observed in the 23 October
data, that we associate with the nucleus thermal light curve. The nucleus
contributes up to 30-55 % of the observed continuum. The large dust-to-gas
ratio (in the range 2-6) can be explained by the unusual activity of the comet
for its size, which allows decimeter size particles and large boulders to be
entrained by the gas. The rotational temperature of CH3OH is measured. We
attribute the increase from 35 to 46 K with increasing beam size (from 150 to
1500 km) to radiative processes. The HCN production rate displays strong
rotation-induced variations. The HCN production curve, as well as those of CO2
and H2O measured by EPOXI, are interpreted with a geometric model which takes
into account the rotation and the shape of the comet. The HCN and H2O
production curves are in phase, showing common sources. The 1.7h delay, in
average, of HCN and H2O with respect to the CO2 production curve suggests that
HCN and H2O are mainly produced by subliming icy grains. The scale length of
production of HCN is determined to be on the order of 500-1000 km, implying a
mean velocity of 100-200 m/s for the icy grains producing HCN. The modulation
of the CO2 prouction and of the velocity offset of the HCN lines are
interpreted in terms of localized sources of gas on the nucleus surface.

most comprehensive process within a company is the corporate value chain. In
this article one key proposition is to use the corporate value chain as the
fundamental structuring backbone for all business process analysis and

the value chain that are essential for the individual companys business and the
root cause for any company success. In this paper we propose to use the

addressing processes in cloud services. Therefor it is necessary to formalize
the way the processes with its interdependencies are documented in context of
their company-specific value chain (as part of the various deployment- and

describe in detail the environmental and external restrictions of processes.

identify cloud-suitable processes within the public sector and thus optimize

one, while emerging at a distance rather longer than the latter.

very effective to increase the throughput of the wireless vehicular network and
decrease the delay of the message communication between vehicular nodes on the
highway. Transmission range is directly proportional to the transmission power
the moving node. If the transmission power will be high, the interference
increases that can cause higher delay in message reception at receiver end,
hence the performance of the network decreased. In this paper, it is analyzed
that how transmission power can be controlled by considering other different
parameter of the network such as; density, distance between moving nodes,
different types of messages dissemination with their priority, selection of an
antenna also affects on the transmission power. The dynamic control of
transmission power in VANETs serves also for the optimization of the resources
where it needs, can be decreased and increased depending on the circumstances
of the network. Different applications and events of different types also cause
changes in transmission power to enhance the reach-ability. The analysis in
this paper is comprised of density, distance with single hop and multi-hop
message broadcasting based dynamic transmission power control as well as
antenna selection and applications based. Some summarized tables are produced
according to the respective parameters of the vehicular network. At the end
some valuable observations are made and discussed in detail. This paper
concludes with a grand summary of all the protocols discussed in it.

mark by adding edge in HH sub-band of the host image after wavelet
decomposition. Contrary to most of the watermarking algorithms in wavelet
domain, our method is blind and results show that it is robust against the JPEG
and GIF compression, histogram and spectrum spreading, noise adding and small
rotation. Its robustness against compression is better than others watermarking
algorithms reported in the literature. The algorithm is flexible because its
capacity or robustness can be improved by modifying some parameters.

department. Since by deciding the best supplier, companies can save material
costs and increase competitive advantage.However this decision becomes
compilcated in case of multiple suppliers, multiple conflicting criteria, and
imprecise parameters. In addition the uncertainty and vagueness of the experts'
opinion is the prominent characteristic of the problem. therefore an
extensively used multi criteria decision making tool Fuzzy AHP can be utilized
as an approach for supplier selection problem. This paper reveals the
application of Fuzzy AHP in a gear motor company determining the best supplier
with respect to selected criteria. the contribution of this study is not only
the application of the Fuzzy AHP methodology for supplier selection problem,
but also releasing a comprehensive literature review of multi criteria decision
making problems. In addition by stating the steps of Fuzzy AHP clearly and
numerically, this study can be a guide of the methodology to be implemented to
other multiple criteria decision making problems.

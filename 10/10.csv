Komissarov, Rony Keppens","Three-Dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations of the Crab Nebula","In revision with MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stt2176",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we give a detailed account of the first 3D relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWN), with
parameters most suitable for the Crab Nebula. In order to clarify the new
features specific to 3D models, reference 2D simulations have been carried out
as well. Compared to the previous 2D simulations, we considered pulsar winds
with much stronger magnetisation, up to \sigma=3, and accounted more accurately
for the anticipated magnetic dissipation in the striped zone of these winds.
While the 3D models preserve the separation of the post termination shock flow
into the equatorial and polar components, their relative strength and
significance differ. Whereas the highly magnetised 2D models produce highly
coherent and well collimated polar jets capable of efficient ""drilling"" through
the supernova shell, in the corresponding 3D models the jets are disrupted by
the kink mode current driven instability and ""dissolve"" into the main body of
PWN after propagation of several shock radii. Our results show that contrary to
the expectations based on 1D analytical and semi-analytical models, our
numerical solutions with highly magnetized pulsar winds still produce
termination shocks with radii comparable to those deduced from the
observations. We present polarized synchrotron maps constructed from the 3D
simulations, showing that the wealth of morphological features observed with
Hubble and Chandra can well be reproduced with 3D-MHD models.

Gram-Schmidt approach and derive a consistency rate in a large dimensional
settings.
  Then, we apply a greedy algorithm with these previous estimators to
Sensitivity Analysis. We also establish the consistency of this $\mathbb

paper with numerical experiments, which demonstrates the low computational cost
of our method as well as its efficiency on standard benchmark of Sensitivity
Analysis.

stabilized 2H-martensite of Cu-Al-Ni shape-memory alloy is studied. The
nucleation process is induced by localized heating and observed by optical
microscopy. It is observed that nucleation occurs after a time delay and that
the nucleation points are always located at one of the corners of the sample (a
rectangular bar in the austenite), regardless of where the localized heating is
applied. Using a simplified nonlinear elasticity model, we propose an
explanation for the location of the nucleation points, by showing that the
martensite is a local minimizer of the energy with respect to localized
variations in the interior, on faces and edges of the sample, but not at some
corners, where a localized microstructure can lower the energy.

probability distributions in parallel. Given a finite computational resource,
this article addresses how to optimally divide sampling effort between the
samplers of the different distributions. Formally approaching this decision
problem requires both the specification of an error criterion to assess how
well each group of samples represent their underlying distribution, and a loss
function to combine the errors into an overall performance score. For the first
part, a new Monte Carlo divergence error criterion based on Jensen-Shannon
divergence is proposed. Using results from information theory, approximations
are derived for estimating this criterion for each target based on a single
run, enabling adaptive sample size choices to be made during sampling.

filtering of a system on a matrix Lie group with invariance properties. The
problem of an invariant continuous-time model with discrete-time measurements
is cast into a rigorous stochastic and geometric framework. Building upon the
theory of continuous-time invariant observers, we show that, as in the linear
case, the error equation is a Markov chain that does not depend on the state
estimate. Thus, when the filter's gains are held fixed, and the filter admits
almost-global convergence properties with noise turned off, the noisy error's
distribution is proved to converge to a stationary distribution, providing
insight into the mathematical theory of filtering on Lie groups. For
engineering purposes we also introduce the discrete-time Invariant Extended
Kalman Filter, for which the trusted covariance matrix is shown to
asymptotically converge, and some numerically more involved sample-based
methods as well to compute the Kalman gains. The methods are applied to
attitude estimation, allowing to derive novel theoretical results in this
field, and illustrated through simulations on synthetic data.

typical long GRBs (~ minutes), and recently it was proposed that these
""ultra-long GRBs"" may form a distinct population, probably with a different
(e.g. blue supergiant) progenitor than typical GRBs. However, Swift
observations suggest that many GRBs have extended central engine activities
manifested as flares and internal plateaus in X-rays. We perform a
comprehensive study on a large sample of Swift GRBs with XRT observations to
investigate GRB central engine activity duration and to determine whether
ultra-long GRBs are unusual events. We define burst duration t_burst based on
both gamma-ray and X-ray light curves rather than using gamma-ray observations
alone. We find that t_burst can be reliably measured in 343 GRBs. Within this
""good"" sample, 21.9% GRBs have t_burst >=10^3 s and 11.5% GRBs have t_burst
>=10^4 s. There is an apparent bimodal distribution of t_burst in this sample.
However, when we consider an ""undetermined"" sample (304 GRBs) with t_burst
possibly falling in the gap between GRB duration T_90 and the first X-ray
observational time, as well as a selection effect against t_burst falling into
the first Swift orbital ""dead zone"" due to observation constraints, the
intrinsic underlying t_burst distribution is consistent with being a single
component distribution. We found that the existing evidence for a separate
ultra-long GRB population is inconclusive, and further multi-wavelength
observations are needed to draw a firmer conclusion. We also discuss the
theoretical implications of our results. In particular, the central engine
activity duration of GRBs is generally much longer than the gamma-ray T90
duration and it does not even correlate with T90. It would be premature to make
a direct connection between T90 and the size of the progenitor star.

specifically identified three genes that showed an expression pattern highly

was independent of the four tested genotypes and the stage (pre- or

one can obtain equations describing a cross-diffusion effect (similar to the
Soret and Dufour effects) between curvature and the (in-membrane) flow of
amphiphilic molecules relative to nonamphiphilic ones. Surprisingly, the shape
of a membrane relaxes according to a simple heat equation in the mean
curvature, a process that is accompanied by a simultaneous boost to the
diffusion of amphiphiles away from regions of high curvature. The model also
predicts the inverse process, by which the forced bending of a membrane induces
a flow of amphiphilic molecules towards areas of high curvature. In principle,
numerical values for the relevant diffusion coefficients should be verifiable
by experiment.

behind schedule or highly likely to have a problematic development phase. In
the last decade, Agile methods have transformed from cult techniques to
mainstream methodologies. Scrum, an Agile software development method, has been
widely adopted due to its adaptive nature.
  This paper presents a metric that measures the quality of the testing process
in a Scrum process. As product quality and process quality correlate, improved
test quality can ensure high quality products. Also, gaining experience from
eight years of successful Scrum implementation at SoftwarePeople, we describe
the Scrum process emphasizing the testing process. We propose a metric Product
Backlog Rating (PBR) to assess the testing process in Scrum. PBR considers the
complexity of the features to be developed in an iteration of Scrum, assesses
test ratings and offers a numerical score of the testing process. This metric
is able to provide a comprehensive overview of the testing process over the
development cycle of a product.
  We present a case study which shows how the metric is used at SoftwarePeople.
The case study explains some features that have been developed in a Sprint in
terms of feature complexity and potential test assessment difficulties and
shows how PBR is calculated during the Sprint. We propose a test process
assessment metric that provides insights into the Scrum testing process.
However, the metric needs further evaluation considering associated resources
(e.g., quality assurance engineers, the length of the Scrum cycle).

location-based social discovery with hundreds of millions of users around the
world. While user (near) realtime geographical information is essential to
enable location-based social discovery in LBSNs, the importance of user
location privacy has also been recognized by leading real-world LBSNs. To
protect user's exact geographical location from being exposed, a number of
location protection approaches have been adopted by the industry so that only
relative location information are publicly disclosed. These techniques are
assumed to be secure and are exercised on the daily base. In this paper, we
question the safety of these location-obfuscation techniques used by existing
LBSNs. We show, for the first time, through real world attacks that they can
all be easily destroyed by an attacker with the capability of no more than a
regular LBSN user. In particular, by manipulating location information fed to
LBSN client app, an ill-intended regular user can easily deduce the exact
location information by running LBSN apps as location oracle and performing a
series of attacking strategies. We develop an automated user location tracking
system and test it on the most popular LBSNs including Wechat, Skout and Momo.
We demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency via a 3 week real-world
experiment with 30 volunteers. Our evaluation results show that we could
geo-locate a target with high accuracy and can readily recover users' Top 5
locations. We also propose to use grid reference system and location
classification to mitigate the attacks. Our work shows that the current

hypothetical infinite C60 chains, we first establish that the polymerization
can in principle increase conductance by several orders of magnitude due to the
strong orbital hybridizations and band formation. On the other hand, our
simulations of the constant-height scanning tunneling microscope (STM)
configuration shows that, in agreement with the recent experimental conclusion,
the junction electronic structure and device characteristics are virtually
unaffected by the C60 chain oligomerization. We further predict that the
switching characteristics including even the ON/OFF-state assignment will
sensitively depend on the substrate metal species due to the Fermi-level
pinning at the substrate-side contact and the subsequent energy level bending
toward the STM tip-side contact. We finally demonstrate that a force-feedbacked
nanoelectromechanical approach in which both of the C60-electrode distances are
kept at short distances before and after switching operations can achieve a
metal-independent and significantly improved switching performance due to the
Fermi-level pinning in both contacts and the large intrinsic conductance

equations are formally very similar to the ones that have been derived for spin
glass models, thus showing that the analogy between spin glasses and structural

strong sense in the mean field limit. We also suggest how the computation could
be generalized in an approximate way to finite dimensional hard spheres. In the
second part of the paper, we discuss the solution of these equations and we
derive from it a number of physical predictions. We show that, below the
Gardner transition where the 1RSB solution becomes unstable, a fullRSB phase
exists and we locate the boundary of the fullRSB phase. Most importantly, we
show that the fullRSB solution predicts correctly that jammed packings are
isostatic, and allows one to compute analytically the critical exponents
associated with the jamming transition, which are missed by the 1RSB solution.

the Faraday instability, typically manifesting itself as a standing wave
pattern. Fundamentally, the phenomenon is an example of parametric resonance.
At high frequencies, the wavelength is small and the pattern selection process
is highly nonlinear. We excite the instability with low frequencies, where the
wavelength is large, and the form is highly influenced by the container
geometry. In this regime, the cell modes are easily excited on an individual
basis and the observed waves resemble the forms predicted from linear theory.
In our video we highlight basic spatial and temporal dynamics of this regime.

response by PLS. The technique embeds the discrete channel selection problem
into the continuous space of predictor preweighting, then employs a
Quasi-Newton (or other) optimization algorithm to optimize the preweighting
vector. Once the weighting vector has been optimized, the magnitudes of the
weights indicate the relative importance of each channel. The relative
importances are used to construct n different models, the kth consisting of the
k most important channels. The different models are then compared by means of
cross validation or an information criterion (e.g. BIC), allowing automatic
selection of a `good' subset of the channels. The analytical Jacobian of the
PLS regression vector with respect to the predictor weighting is derived to
facilitate optimization of the latter. This formulation exploits the reduced
rank of the predictor matrix to gain some speedup when the number of
observations is fewer than the number of predictors (the usual case for e.g. IR
spectroscopy). The method compares favourably with predictor selection

employs the framework of Chierichetti et al. [2012], who (under assumption of
myopic node behavior) investigate the scheduling of node decisions to promote
cascades of product adoptions preferred by the scheduler. We show that when
nodes behave strategically, outcomes can be extremely different. We exhibit
cases where in the strategic setting 100% of agents adopt, but in the myopic
setting only an arbitrarily small epsilon % do. Conversely, we present cases
where in the strategic setting 0% of agents adopt, but in the myopic setting
(100-epsilon)% do, for any constant epsilon > 0. Additionally, we prove some
properties of cascade processes with strategic agents, both in general and for

laws play a central role in complex systems theory; therefore, the current
limitations in the identification of this distribution in empirical data are a
major obstacle to pursue the insights that the complexity approach offers in
many fields. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a reliable
methodology with a solid theoretical foundation, the Taylor Series-Based Power
Law Range Identification Method. When applied to time series from 39 countries,
this method reveals a well-defined power law in the relative per capita GDP
contractions that span from 5.53% to 50%, comprising 263 events. However, this
observation does not suffice to attribute recessions to some specific
mechanism, such as self-organized criticality. The paper highlights a set of

the power law, as needed to develop sound tools for the management of

remnants (SNRs) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The objects were

  Methods: Data obained with XMM-Newton are used to investigate the
morphological and spectral features of the remnants in X-rays. We measure the
plasma conditions, look for supernova (SN) ejecta emission, and constrain some
of the SNR properties (e.g. age and ambient density). We supplement the X-ray
data with optical, infrared, and radio-continuum archival observations, which
allow us to understand the conditions resulting in the current appearance of
the remnants. Based on the spatially-resolved star formation history (SFH) of
the LMC together with the X-ray spectra, we attempt to type the supernovae that
created the remnants.
  Results: We confirm all four objects as SNRs, to which we assign the names
MCSNR J0508-6830, MCSNR J0511-6759, MCSNR J0514-6840, and MCSNR J0517-6759. In
the first two remnants, an X-ray bright plasma is surrounded by very faint [S
II] emission. The emission from the central plasma is dominated by Fe L-shell
lines, and the derived iron abundance is greatly in excess of solar. This
establishes their type Ia (i.e. thermonuclear) SN origin. They appear to be
more evolved versions of other Magellanic Cloud iron-rich SNRs which are
centrally-peaked in X-rays. From the two other remnants (MCSNR J0514-6840 and
MCSNR J0517-6759), we do not see ejecta emission. At all wavelengths at which
they are detected, the local environment plays a key role in their
observational appearance. We present evidence that MCSNR J0517-6759 is close to

dynamical systems evolve because of mass loss and tides. This paper considers
the combined action of stellar mass loss and tidal dissipation on planetary
orbits in order to determine the conditions required for planetary survival.
Stellar mass loss is included using a so-called Jeans model, described by a
dimensionless mass loss rate \gamma and an index \beta. We use an analogous
prescription to model tidal effects, described here by a dimensionless
dissipation rate \Gamma and two indices (q,p). The initial conditions are
determined by the starting value of angular momentum parameter \eta
(equivalently, the initial eccentricity) and the phase \theta of the orbit.
Within the context of this model, we derive an analytic formula for the
critical dissipation rate \Gamma, which marks the boundary between orbits that
spiral outward due to stellar mass loss and those that spiral inward due to
tidal dissipation. This analytic result
\Gamma=\Gamma(\gamma,\beta,q,p,\eta,\theta) is essentially exact for initially
circular orbits and holds to within an accuracy of 50% over the entire
multi-dimensional parameter space, where the individual parameters vary by
several orders of magnitude. For stars that experience mass loss, the stellar
radius often displays quasi-periodic variations, which produce corresponding
variations in tidal forcing; we generalize the calculation to include such
pulsations using a semi-analytic treatment that holds to the same accuracy as
the non-pulsating case. These results can be used in many applications, e.g.,
to predict/constrain properties of planetary systems orbiting white dwarfs.

report a new 2D TI comprising a graphene layer sandwiched between two Bi2Se3
slabs that exhibits a large intrinsic bulk band gap of 30 to 50 meV, making it
viable for room-temperature applications. Distinct from previous strategies for
enhancing the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling effect of the graphene lattice, the
present graphene-based TI operates on a new mechanism of strong inversion
between graphene Dirac bands and Bi2Se3 conduction bands. Strain engineering
leads to effective control and substantial enhancement of the bulk gap.
Recently reported synthesis of smooth graphene/Bi2Se3 interfaces demonstrates
feasibility of experimental realization of this new 2D TI structure, which
holds great promise for nanoscale device applications.

representation of 3D shapes by triangular meshes with a large number of
vertices. Compression techniques dedicated to such meshes have emerged, which
exploit the idea that the connectivity of a dense mesh does not deviate much
from the connectivity that can be constructed automatically from the vertex
positions (while possibly being guided by additional codes). The edge flip is
one of the tools that can encode the differences between two meshes, and it is
important to control the length of a sequence of flips that transform one
triangulation into another. This paper provides a practical solution to this
problem. Indeed, the problem of determining a minimal sequence of edge flips
between two triangulations is NP-complete for some types of triangulations
including manifold triangulations of surfaces, so that it is necessary to
develop heuristics. Moreover, it is sometimes difficult to establish a first
sequence of flips between two meshes, and we advocate a solution based on the
reduction of an existing sequence. The new approach we propose is founded on
the assignment of labels to identify the edges, with a property of label
transfer during a flip. This gives a meaning to the tracking of an edge in a
sequence of flips and offers the exploitation of very simple combinatorial
properties. All the operations are performed directly on the sequence of labels
denoting the edges to be flipped, almost regardless of the underlying surface,
since only local temporary connectivity is involved.

  The ""special state"" theory is conservative with respect to quantum mechanics,
but radical with respect to statistical mechanics, in particular regarding the
arrow of time. In this article background material is given on both quantum
measurement and statistical mechanics aspects. For example, it is shown that
future boundary conditions would not contradict experience, indicating that the
fundamental equal-a-priori-probability assumption at the foundations of
statistical mechanics is far too strong (since future conditioning reduces the
class of allowed states).
  The test is based on a feature of this theory that was found necessary in
order to recover standard (Born) probabilities in quantum measurements.
Specifically, certain systems should have ""noise"" whose amplitude follows the
long-tailed Cauchy distribution. This distribution is marked by the occasional
occurrence of extremely large signals as well as a non-self-averaging property.
The proposed test is a variant of the Stern-Gerlach experiment in which
protocols are devised, some of which will require the presence of this noise,
some of which will not. The likely observational schemes would involve the
distinction between detection and non-detection of that ""noise"". The signal to
be detected (or not) would be either single photons in the visible and UV range
or electric fields (and related excitations) in the neighborhood of the ends of
the magnets.

Space Telescope (HST), Very Large Telescope (VLT), and Swift X-ray telescope
(XRT) of the intermediate mass black hole ESO 243-49 HLX-1 that were taken 2
months apart between September and November 2010. Previous separate analyses of
these data found that they were consistent with an irradiated accretion disc
with contribution from either a very young or very old stellar population, and
also indicated that the optical flux of the HLX-1 counterpart could be
variable. Such variability could only be attributed to a varying accretion
disc, so simultaneous analysis of all data sets should break the degeneracies
in the model fits. We thus simultaneously fit the broad-band spectral energy
distribution (SED) from near-infrared through to X-ray wavelengths of the two
epochs of data with a model consisting of an irradiated accretion disc and a
stellar population. We show that this combined analysis rules out an old
stellar population, finding that the SED is dominated by emission from an
accretion disc with moderate reprocessing in the outer disc around an
intermediate mass black hole imbedded in a young (20 Myr) stellar cluster with
a mass of 1E5 Msun. We also place an upper limit on the mass of an additional
hidden old stellar population of 1E6 Msun. However, optical r-band observations
of HLX-1 obtained with the Gemini-South telescope covering part of the decay
from a later X-ray outburst are consistent with constant optical flux,
indicating that the observed variability between the HST and VLT observations
could be spurious caused by differences in the background subtraction applied
to the two optical data sets. In this scenario the contribution of the stellar
population, and thus the stellar mass of the cluster, may be higher (abridged).

homogeneity found inside 1 R_e often breaks down at larger radii, where a
variety of kinematic behaviors are observed. While central slow rotators remain
slowly rotating in their halos, central fast rotators show more diversity,
ranging from rapidly increasing to rapidly declining specific angular momentum
profiles in the outer regions. There are indications that the outer trends
depend on morphological type, raising questions about the proposed unification

Several galaxies in our sample show multiple lines of evidence for distinct

related to the stars. In two sources, IRAS 18460-0151 and IRAS 18596+0315, we
identified wide velocity components with a width of 35-40 km/s that are centred
at the stellar velocities. These wide components can be associated with the
former AGB envelope of the progenitor star. A third case, IRAS 18286-0959, is
reported as tentative; in this case a pair of narrow velocity components,
symmetrically located with respect to the stellar velocity, has been
discovered. We also modelled the line emission using an LVG code and derived
some global physical parameters, which allowed us to discuss the possible
origin of this gas in relation to the known bipolar outflows. For IRAS
18460-0151 and IRAS 18596+0315, we derived molecular masses close to 0.2 solar
masses, mean densities of 10^4 cm^{-3}, and mass-loss rates of 10^{-4}
M_sun/yr. The kinetic temperatures are rather low, between 10 and 50 K in both
cases, which suggests that the CO emission is arising from the outer and cooler
regions of the envelopes. No fitting was possible for IRAS 18286-0959, because
line contamination can not be discarded in this case.

instability (SASI) can drive spiral modes that efficiently redistribute angular
momentum. This process can impart a spin to the forming neutron star even when
the progenitor star is non-rotating. Here we develop the first analytical
description of the angular momentum redistribution driven by a spiral mode of
the SASI. Our analysis, valid in the limit of small mode amplitude, shows that
the angular momentum separation is driven by the Reynolds stress generated by
the spiral mode. The resulting solutions compare favorably with previous
three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the SASI in the linear and weakly
non-linear phases. Reasonable agreement is also found when extrapolating the
solutions into the fully non-linear phase. A Reynolds-decomposition of the flow
is performed in the saturated state of these simulations, showing that outward
angular momentum transport by the Reynolds stress and the fluctuating component
of the mass flux balance inward transport by advection. We derive an
approximate analytic expression for the maximum angular momentum deposited in
the neutron star as a function of the mass accretion rate, shock radius, shock
compression ratio, and amplitude of the spiral mode at the time of explosion.
Implications for the birth spin periods of neutron stars are discussed.

age and stellar mass content. Our study shows that both high and low accretion
rate subsamples reside in bluer and lower density environments than the control
samples. However, we find that this difference is at least two times stronger
for the low accretion rate Seyferts.
  In the vicinity of Seyfert 2, red galaxies have systematically lower values
of stellar-mass as compared with corresponding control samples. The lower
values of stellar mass for red neighbours is more significant at higher density
environments and it is more evident for low accretion rate Seyfert. We also
find that this effect is independent of the host's stellar mass.
  Our results are consistent with a scenario where AGN occurrence is higher in
lower/medium density environments with a higher merger rate and a lack of a
dense intergalactic medium (that can strip gas from these systems) that provide
suitable conditions for the central black hole feeding. We find this
particularly evident for the low accretion rate Seyferts that could compensate
through the intergalactic medium the lack of gas of their hosts.

Circinus ULX5, including coordinated follow-up observations with XMM-Newton and

a ULX reliably detected at hard (E>10 keV) X-rays. Circinus ULX5 is variable on
long timescales by at least a factor of ~5 in flux, and was caught in a
historically bright state during our 2013 observations (0.3-30.0 keV luminosity
of 1.6e40 erg/s). During this epoch, the source displayed a curved 3-10 keV
spectrum, broadly similar to other bright ULXs. While in many cases the
interpretation of spectral components in ULXs is uncertain, the spectral and
temporal properties of the all the high quality datasets currently available
strongly support a simple disk-corona model reminiscent of that invoked for
Galactic binaries, with the accretion disk becoming more prominent as the
luminosity increases. However, although the disk temperature and luminosity are
remarkably well correlated across all timescales currently probed, the observed
luminosity follows T^(1.70+/-0.17), flatter than that expected for simple
blackbody radiation. The spectral variability displayed by Circinus ULX5 is
highly reminiscent of that observed from some known Galactic black hole
binaries (BHBs) at high luminosities. This comparison would imply a black hole
mass of ~90 Msun for Circinus ULX5. However, given the diverse behavior
observed from Galactic BHB accretion disks, this mass estimate is still
uncertain. Finally, the limits placed on any undetected iron absorption
features with the 2013 dataset imply that we are not viewing the central
regions of Circinus ULX5 through any extreme super-Eddington outflow.

the radial drift and the vertical settling of the particles. Here we study how
the radial drift of dust particles is affected by grain growth. In a first
step, toy models in which grain growth can either be constant, accelerate or
decelerate are introduced. The equations of motion are analytically integrable
and therefore the grains dynamics is easy to understand.
  The radial motion of growing grains is governed by the relative efficiency of
the growth and migration processes which is expressed by the dimensionless
parameter Lambda, as well as the exponents for the gas surface density and
temperature profiles, denoted p and q respectively. When Lambda is of order
unity, growth and migration are strongly coupled, providing the most efficient
radial drift. For the toy models considered, grains pile up when -p+q+1/2<0.
Importantly, we show the existence of a second process which can help discs to
retain their solid materials. For accelerating growth, grains end up their
migration at a finite radius, thus avoiding being accreted onto the central
star.

of acquaintances, often of no more than a handful of individuals, connecting
almost any two people on the planet. It is often expressed in the language of
networks, where it is equivalent to the statement that most pairs of
individuals are connected by a short path through the acquaintance network.
Although the small-world effect is well-established empirically for
contemporary social networks, we argue here that it is a relatively recent
phenomenon, arising only in the last few hundred years: for most of mankind's
tenure on Earth the social world was large, with most pairs of individuals
connected by relatively long chains of acquaintances, if at all. Our
conclusions are based on observations about the spread of diseases, which
travel over contact networks between individuals and whose dynamics can give us
clues to the structure of those networks even when direct network measurements
are not available. As an example we consider the spread of the Black Death in
14th-century Europe, which is known to have traveled across the continent in
well-defined waves of infection over the course of several years. Using
established epidemiological models, we show that such wave-like behavior can
occur only if contacts between individuals living far apart are exponentially
rare. We further show that if long-distance contacts are exponentially rare,
then the shortest chain of contacts between distant individuals is on average a
long one. The observation of the wave-like spread of a disease like the Black
Death thus implies a network without the small-world effect.

where growth and migration are tightly coupled. This includes the crucial issue
of the radial-drift barrier for growing dust grains. We therefore extend the
study performed in Paper I, considering models for grain growth and grain
dynamics where both the migration and growth rate depend on the grain size and
the location in the disc. The parameter space of disc profiles and growth
models is exhaustively explored. In doing so, interpretations for the grain
motion found in numerical simulations are also provided.
  We find that a large number of cases is required to characterise entirely the
grains radial motion, providing a large number of possible outcomes. Some of
them lead dust particles to be accreted onto the central star and some of them
don't.
  We find then that q<1 is required for discs to retain their growing
particles, where q is the exponent of the radial temperature profile T(R)
proportional to R^-q. Additionally, the initial dust-to gas ratio has to exceed
a critical value for grains to pile up efficiently, thus avoiding being
accreted onto the central star. Discs are also found to retain efficiently
small dust grains regenerated by fragmentation. We show how those results are
sensitive to the turbulent model considered.
  Even though some physical processes have been neglected, this study allows to
sketch a scenario in which grains can survive the radial-drift barrier in
protoplanetary discs as they grow.

  We find that the settling efficiency depends on the value of the
dimensionless parameter gamma, which characterises the relative efficiency of
grain growth with respect to the gas drag. Since gamma is expected to be of
order as the initial dust-to-gas ratio in the disc (of order 10^-2), grain
growth enhances the energy dissipation of the dust particles and improve the
settling efficiency in protoplanetary discs. This behaviour is mostly
independent of the growth model considered as well as of the radial drift of

high-dimensional systems of random variables. One example of such a model is
the undirected graph, in which lack of an edge represents conditional
independence between two random variables given the rest. Another example is
the bidirected graph, in which absence of edges encodes pairwise marginal
independence. Both of these classes of graphical models have been extensively
studied, and while they are considered to be dual to one another, except in a
few instances this duality has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper,
we demonstrate how duality between undirected and bidirected models can be used
to transport results for one class of graphical models to the dual model in a
transparent manner. We proceed to apply this technique to extend previously
existing results as well as to prove new ones, in three important domains.
First, we discuss the pairwise and global Markov properties for undirected and
bidirected models, using the pseudographoid and reverse-pseudographoid rules
which are weaker conditions than the typically used intersection and
composition rules. Second, we investigate these pseudographoid and reverse
pseudographoid rules in the context of probability distributions, using the
concept of duality in the process. Duality allows us to quickly relate them to
the more familiar intersection and composition properties. Third and finally,
we apply the dualization method to understand the implications of faithfulness,
which in turn leads to a more general form of an existing result.

binding energies, and the site-to-site variation within each boundary is
substantial. Comparing the vacancy binding energies for each site in different

implementing a quantum Monte Carlo method to solve for the Berry curvature,

one and two dimensions, the latter of which is non-integrable. Despite the fact
that the Berry curvature gives information about the phase of the wave
function, we show that our algorithm has no sign or phase problem for standard

methods as a function of system size and energy gap, and therefore should prove
a valuable tool in investigating the quantum geometry of many-body systems.

high fields is spatially non-uniform, incorporating small gap values. These, in
addition to d-wave gap nodes, are responsible for the persistence of quantum
oscillations. Important here are methodologies for distinguishing different

galaxies identified by the Herschel Lensing Survey, plus two well-studied
lensed galaxies, MS1512-cB58 and the Cosmic Eye, for which we also provide
updated Herschel measurements, are used to determine the physical properties of
z~1.5-3 star-forming galaxies close to or below the detection limits of blank
fields. We constrain their stellar and dust content, determine star formation
rates and histories, dust attenuation and extinction laws, and other related
properties. We perform SED-fits of the full photometry of each object as well
for the optical and infrared parts separately, exploring various parameters,
including nebular emission. The IR observations and emission line measurements,
where available, are used a posteriori constraints on the models. Besides the
various stellar population models we explore, we use the observed IR/UV ratio
to estimate the extinction and create ""energy conserving models"", that
constrain most accurately the physical properties of our sources. Our sample
has a median lensing-corrected IR luminosity ~ 3e11 Lsun, stellar masses
between 2e9 and 2e11 Msun, and IR/UV luminosity ratios spanning a wide range.
The dust masses of our galaxies are in the range 2 to 17e7 Msun, extending
previous studies at the same redshift down to lower masses. We do not find any
particular trend of the dust temperature Tdust with IR luminosity, suggesting
an overall warmer dust regime at our redshift regardless of luminosity. Lensing
enables us to study the detailed physical properties of individual IR-detected
z~1.5-3 galaxies up to a factor ~10 fainter than achieved with deep blank field
observations. We demonstrate that multi-wavelength observations combining
stellar and dust emission can constrain star formation histories and extinction
laws of star-forming galaxies.

a zone upstream to a lane-drop bottleneck based on two traffic flow models: the
Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model, which is an infinite-dimensional
partial differential equation, and the link queue model, which is a
finite-dimensional ordinary differential equation. In both models, the
discharging flow-rate is determined by a recently developed model of capacity
drop, and the upstream in-flux is regulated by the speed limit in the VSL zone.
Since the link queue model approximates the LWR model and is much simpler, we
first analyze the control problem and develop effective VSL strategies based on
the former. First for an open-loop control system with a constant speed limit,
we prove that a constant speed limit can introduce an uncongested equilibrium
state, in addition to a congested one with capacity drop, but the congested
equilibrium state is always exponentially stable. Then we apply a feedback
proportional-integral (PI) controller to form a closed-loop control system, in
which the congested equilibrium state and, therefore, capacity drop can be
removed by the I-controller. Both analytical and numerical results show that,
with appropriately chosen controller parameters, the closed-loop control system
is stable, effect, and robust. Finally, we show that the VSL strategies based
on I- and PI-controllers are also stable, effective, and robust for the LWR
model. Since the properties of the control system are transferable between the
two models, we establish a dual approach for studying the control problems of
nonlinear traffic flow systems. We also confirm that the VSL strategy is
effective only if capacity drop occurs. The obtained method and insights can be
useful for future studies on other traffic control methods and implementations
of VSL strategies.

objects moving in the gravitational potential of the Galaxy, without assuming
any theoretical models of the visible and dark matter components of the Galaxy.
We study the effect on the RC due to the uncertainties in the values of the
Galactic Constants (GCs) $R_\odot$ and $V_\odot$ (these being the sun's
distance from and circular rotation speed around the Galactic center,
respectively) and the velocity anisotropy parameter $\beta$ of the halo tracer
objects used for deriving the RC at large Galactocentric distances. The
resulting RC in the disk region is found to depend significantly on the choice
of the GCs, while the dominant uncertainty in the RC at large distances beyond
the stellar disk comes from the uncertainty in the value of $\beta$. In general
we find that the mean RC steadily declines at distances beyond $\sim 60$ kpc,
independently of the value of $\beta$. Also, at a given radius, the circular
speed is lower for larger values of $\beta$ (i.e., for more radially biased
velocity anisotropy). Considering that the largest possible value of $\beta$ is
unity, which corresponds to stellar orbits being purely radial, our results for
the case of $\beta=1$ give a lower limit to the total mass of the Galaxy within

develop a simple model of capacity drop within the framework of kinematic wave
theory based on the observation that capacity drop occurs when an upstream
queue forms at an active bottleneck. In addition, we assume that the
fundamental diagrams are continuous in steady states. This assumption is
consistent with observations and can avoid unrealistic infinite characteristic
wave speeds in discontinuous fundamental diagrams. A core component of the new
model is an entropy condition defined by a discontinuous boundary flux
function. For a lane-drop area, we demonstrate that the model is well-defined,
and its Riemann problem can be uniquely solved. We theoretically discuss
traffic stability with this model subject to perturbations in density, upstream
demand, and downstream supply. We clarify that discontinuous flow-density

incomplete observations of traffic states. Theoretical results are consistent

study human social behavior, while challenging our capability to analyze their
massive data streams. One of the emerging tasks is to distinguish between
different kinds of activities, for example engineered misinformation campaigns
versus spontaneous communication. Such detection problems require a formal
definition of meme, or unit of information that can spread from person to
person through the social network. Once a meme is identified, supervised
learning methods can be applied to classify different types of communication.
The appropriate granularity of a meme, however, is hardly captured from
existing entities such as tags and keywords. Here we present a framework for
the novel task of detecting memes by clustering messages from large streams of
social data. We evaluate various similarity measures that leverage content,
metadata, network features, and their combinations. We also explore the idea of
pre-clustering on the basis of existing entities. A systematic evaluation is
carried out using a manually curated dataset as ground truth. Our analysis
shows that pre-clustering and a combination of heterogeneous features yield the
best trade-off between number of clusters and their quality, demonstrating that
a simple combination based on pairwise maximization of similarity is as
effective as a non-trivial optimization of parameters. Our approach is fully
automatic, unsupervised, and scalable for real-time detection of memes in

radiation (CMB) is essential to probe the physics of the early universe. Since
a single statistical estimator can hardly be suitable to detect the various
possible forms of non-Gaussianity, it is important to employ different
statistical indicators to study non-Gaussianity of CMB. This has motivated the
proposal of a number statistical tools, including two large-angle indicators
based on skewness and kurtosis of spherical caps of CMB sky-sphere. Although
suitable to detect fairly large non-Gaussianity they are unable to detect
non-Gaussianity within the Planck bounds, and exhibit power spectra with
undesirable oscillation pattern. Here we use several thousands simulated CMB
maps to examine interrelated problems regarding advances of these spherical
patches procedures. We examine whether a change in the choice of the patches
could enhance the sensitivity of the procedures well enough to detect
large-angle non-Gaussianity within the Planck bounds. To this end, a new
statistical procedure with non-overlapping cells is proposed and its capability
is established. We also study whether this new procedure is capable to smooth
out the undesirable oscillation pattern in the skewness and kurtosis power
spectra of the spherical caps procedure. We show that the new procedure solves
this problem, making clear this unexpected power spectra pattern does not have
a physical origin, but rather presumably arises from the overlapping obtained
with the spherical caps approach. Finally, we make a comparative analysis of
this new statistical procedure with the spherical caps routine, determine their
lower bounds for non-Gaussianity detection, and make apparent their relative
strength and sensitivity.

shown to be robust when we adopt a more refined model based on the halo

controlling the anisotropy in redshift-space effectively by deforming the

electrons couple strongly to these distortions. For small distortions the
system is metallic, with ground state of predominantly $d^8\ligand$ character,
where $\ligand$ denotes a ligand hole. For sufficiently large distortions
($\delta d_{\rm Ni-O} \sim 0.05 - 0.10\AA$), however, a gap opens at the Fermi
energy as the system enters a periodically distorted state alternating along
the three crystallographic axes, with $(d^8\ligand^2)_{S=0}(d^8)_{S=1}$
character, where $S$ is the total spin. Thus the MI transition may be viewed as
being driven by an internal volume ""collapse"" where the NiO$_6$ octahedra with
two ligand holes shrink around their central Ni, while the remaining octahedra
expand accordingly, resulting in the ($1/2,1/2,1/2$) superstructure observed in
x-ray diffraction in the insulating phase. This insulating state is an example
of a new type of charge ordering achieved without any actual movement of the
charge.

Minor edits since last version",,,,"math.NA math.PR q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Tau-leaping is a popular discretization method for generating approximate
paths of continuous time, discrete space, Markov chains, notably for
biochemical reaction systems. To compute expected values in this context, an
appropriate multilevel Monte Carlo form of tau-leaping has been shown to
improve efficiency dramatically. In this work we derive new analytic results
concerning the computational complexity of multilevel Monte Carlo tau-leaping
that are significantly sharper than previous ones. We avoid taking asymptotic
limits, and focus on a practical setting where the system size is large enough
for many events to take place along a path, so that exact simulation of paths
is expensive, making tau-leaping an attractive option. We use a general scaling
of the system components that allows for the reaction rate constants and the
abundances of species to vary over several orders of magnitude, and we exploit
the random time change representation developed by Kurtz. The key feature of
the analysis that allows for the sharper bounds is that when comparing relevant
pairs of processes we analyze the variance of their difference directly rather
than bounding via the second moment. Use of the second moment is natural in the
setting of a diffusion equation, where multilevel was first developed and where
strong convergence results for numerical methods are readily available, but is
not optimal for the Poisson-driven jump systems that we consider here. We also
present computational results that illustrate the new analysis.

we consider an ideal cavity in which the effects due to the environment are
neglected. Under this conditions, the most important feature of the dynamics is
its periodicity, which may be seen on the temporal evolution of the light
state. The entanglement dynamics, which is studied through the negativity and
the linear entropy, shows a periodic behaviour too. On the other hand, when
considering the interaction between the cavity and the environment, taking into
account both an incoherent pumping and a photon leakage, the dynamics is no
longer periodic. Instead, it may be seen that the entanglement reach stationary
values, which depend on the incoherent pumping and photon leakage rates.
Finally, we discuss the possibility of using this sort of systems for quantum
information processing.

high-density grains have extreme isotopic anomalies in C, Ca and Ti, which
cannot be explained by envelope predictions of asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
stars or theoretical supernova models. The Ca and Ti isotopic anomalies,
however, match the predictions of He-shell abundances in AGB stars. In this
study, we show that the C, Ca, and Ti isotopic anomalies are consistent with
nucleosynthesis predictions of the H-ingestion phase during a very late thermal
pulse (VLTP) event in post-AGB stars. The low $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C isotopic ratios
in these grains are a result of abundant $^{12}$C efficiently capturing the
protons that are being ingested during the VLTP. Very high neutron densities of
$\sim 10^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$, typical of the $i$-process, are achieved during this
phase in post-AGB stars. The large $^{42,43,44}$Ca excesses in some graphite
grains are indicative of neutron capture nucleosynthesis during VLTP. The
comparison of VLTP nucleosynthesis calculations to the graphite data also
indicate that apparent anomalies in the Ti isotopic ratios are due to large
contributions from $^{46,48}$Ca, which cannot be resolved from the isobars
$^{46,48}$Ti during the measurements. We conclude that presolar graphite grains
with moderate to extreme Ca and Ti isotopic anomalies originate in post-AGB

stars may result from merging stars and owe their strong magnetism to fields
generated by a dynamo mechanism as they merge. We postulate a simple dynamo
that generates magnetic field from differential rotation. The growth of
magnetic fields is limited by the requirement that the poloidal field
stabilizes the toroidal and vice versa. While magnetic torques dissipate the
differential rotation, toroidal field is generated from poloidal by an Omega
dynamo. We further suppose that mechanisms that lead to the decay of toroidal
field lead to the generation of poloidal. Both poloidal and toroidal fields
reach a stable configuration which is independent of the size of small initial
seed fields but proportional to the initial differential rotation. We pose the
hypothesis that strongly magnetic stars form from the merging of two stellar
objects. The highest fields are generated when the merge introduces
differential rotation that amounts to critical break up velocity within the
condensed object. Calibration of a simplistic dynamo model with the observed
maximum flux per unit mass for main-sequence stars and white dwarfs indicates
that about 1.5x10^-4 of the decaying toroidal flux must appear as poloidal. The
highest fields in single white dwarfs are generated when two degenerate cores
merge inside a common envelope or when two white dwarfs merge by
gravitational-radiation angular momentum loss.

isotopic chain in both the isoscalar (IS) and the isovector (IV, or E1)
electric channels, to provide testable predictions and guidance for new
experiments with stable targets and radioactive beams. We use the
self-consistent Quasi-particle Random-Phase Approximation (QRPA) with
finite-range interactions and mainly the Gogny D1S force. We analyze also the
performance of a realistic two-body interaction supplemented by a
phenomenological three-body contact term. We find that from N=50 and up to the
N=82 shell closure (132Sn) the lowest-energy part of the IS-LED spectrum is
dominated by a collective transition whose properties vary smoothly with
neutron number and which cannot be interpreted as a neutron-skin oscillation.
For the neutron-rich species this state contributes to the E1 strength below
particle threshold, but much more E1 strength is carried by other, weak but
numerous transitions around or above threshold. We find that strong structural
changes in the spectrum take effect beyond N=82, namely increased LED strength
and lower excitation energies. Our results with the Gogny interaction are
compatible with existing data. On this basis we predict that a) the summed IS
strength below particle threshold shall be of the same order of magnitude for
N=50-82, b) the summed E1 strength up to approximately 12 MeV shall be similar
for N=50-82 MeV, while c) the summed E1 strength below threshold shall be of
the same order of magnitude for N ~ 64 - 82 and much weaker for the lighter,
more-symmetric isotopes. We point out a general agreement of our results with
other non-relativistic studies, the absence of a collective IS mode in some of
those studies, and a possibly radical disagreement with relativistic models.

knowing what a needle is and without knowing if there is one in the haystack?
This kind of problem requires a paradigm shift - away from hypothesis driven
searches of the data - towards a methodology that lets the data speak for
itself. Dynamic Quantum Clustering (DQC) is such a methodology. DQC is a
powerful visual method that works with big, high-dimensional data. It exploits
variations of the density of the data (in feature space) and unearths subsets
of the data that exhibit correlations among all the measured variables. The
outcome of a DQC analysis is a movie that shows how and why sets of data-points
are eventually classified as members of simple clusters or as members of - what
we call - extended structures. This allows DQC to be successfully used in a
non-conventional exploratory mode where one searches data for unexpected
information without the need to model the data. We show how this works for big,
complex, real-world datasets that come from five distinct fields: i.e., x-ray
nano-chemistry, condensed matter, biology, seismology and finance. These
studies show how DQC excels at uncovering unexpected, small - but meaningful -
subsets of the data that contain important information. We also establish an
important new result: namely, that big, complex datasets often contain
interesting structures that will be missed by many conventional clustering
techniques. Experience shows that these structures appear frequently enough
that it is crucial to know they can exist, and that when they do, they encode
important hidden information. In short, we not only demonstrate that DQC can be
flexibly applied to datasets that present significantly different challenges,
we also show how a simple analysis can be used to look for the needle in the
haystack, determine what it is, and find what this means.

among N systems are derived. One set of inequalities is based on witnesses with
two measurement settings, and may be used to demonstrate correlation of
outcomes between two parties, that cannot be shared with more parties. It is
shown that the monogamy for steering is directional. Two parties cannot
independently demonstrate steering of a third system, using the same
two-setting steering witness, but it is possible for one party to steer two
independent systems. This result explains the monogamy of two-setting Bell
inequality violations, and the sensitivity of the continuous variable (CV) EPR
criterion to losses on the steering party. We generalise to m settings. A
second type of monogamy relation gives the quantitative amount of sharing
possible, when the number of parties is less than or equal to m, and takes a
form similar to the Coffman-Kundu-Wootters (CKW) relation for entanglement. The

we established corrections for both effects which push the stability of the

analyzed by regression in order to fit exposure-response curves and estimate
ECx values (x% Effective Concentration). But regression is often misused on
such data, ignoring statistical issues related to i) the special nature of
reproduction data (count data), ii) a potential inter-replicate variability and
iii) a possible concomitant mortality. This paper offers new insights in
dealing with those issues. Concerning mortality, particular attention was paid
not to waste any valuable data - by dropping all the replicates with mortality
- or to bias ECx values. For that purpose we defined a new covariate summing
the observation periods during which each individual contributes to the
reproduction process. This covariate was then used to quantify reproduction -
for each replicate at each concentration - as a number of offspring per
individual-day. We formulated three exposure-response models differing by their
stochastic part. Those models were fitted to four datasets and compared using a
Bayesian framework. The individual-day unit proved to be a suitable approach to
use all the available data and prevent bias in the estimation of ECx values.
Furthermore, a non-classical negative-binomial model was shown to correctly
describe the inter-replicate variability observed in the studied datasets.

extend the Akutsu-Deguchi-Ohtsuki invariant of links in S^3 colored by complex

representation theory of the quantum group Uqsl2, where the definition of the

that as the temperature of the surrounding environment increases, so the

this has been to invoke the quantum Zeno effect: that the watched pot never

quantum system, a proton in an asymmetric double-well potential, the action of
the environment is to enhance the tunnelling rate (an anti-Zeno effect). We

entanglement in a double Jaynes-Cummings system is investigated. We consider
large cavities in which a finite time necessary for light to travel between the
atoms and the cavity mirrors may result in retardation effects. Our results
demonstrate the qualitatively new behaviour observable in the time evolution of
entanglement when the retardation effects are included. Solutions for single
and double excitation in the system are presented. We follow the temporal
evolution of an initial entanglement and find that the evolution is affected
drastically by the retardation effects. In particular, the harmonic
oscillations of the atomic populations and the concurrence, characteristic of
single-mode Jaynes-Cummings systems, are suppressed when the retardation
effects are included. The process of revival of the entanglement degrades with
an increasing number of the cavity modes to which the atoms are coupled. It is
also found that the effect of the retardation on the doubly excited states is
more drastic than on the single excitation states that at relatively short
times, the retardation leads to a complete distortion of entanglement carried
by a doubly excited state.

conjectured that two mixing shifts of finite type are entropy-conjugate if they

complex physical systems combining thermodynamics and fluid-mechanical
processes. The well known tendency of vorticity to self-organization, an
universal property of the two-dimensional fluids, is part of the full dynamics,
but its description requires particular methods. The general framework for the
thermodynamical and mechanical processes is based on conservation laws while
the vorticity self-organization needs a variational approach. It is difficult
to estimate to what extent the vorticity self-organization (a purely kinematic
process) have influenced the characteristics of the tropical cyclone at
stationarity. If this influence is substantial it is expected that the
stationary state of the tropical cyclone has the same nature as the vortices of
many other systems in nature: ideal (Euler) fluids, superconductors, Bose -
Einstein condensate, cosmic strings, etc.
  In previous works we have formulated a description of the $2D$ vorticity
self-organization in terms of a classical field theory. The field theoretical
(FT) formulation finds that the quasi-coherent form of the atmospheric vortex
(tropical cyclone) at stationarity is an expression of the Self-Duality.
  In the present work we examine a strong property of the tropical cyclone,
which arises in the FT formulation in a natural way: the equality of the masses
of the particles associated to the matter field and respectively to the gauge
field in the FT model is translated into the equality between the maximum
radial extension of the tropical cyclone and the Rossby radius. For the cases
where the FT model is a good approximation we calculate characteristic
quantities of the tropical cyclone and find good comparison with observational
data.

does not _alone_ generate a gauge transformation. Each first-class constraint
in Maxwell's theory generates a change in the electric field E by an arbitrary
gradient, spoiling Gauss's law. The secondary constraint p^i,_i=0 still holds,
but being a function of derivatives of momenta (mere auxiliary fields), it is
not directly about the observable electric field (a function of derivatives of
A), which couples to charge. Only a special combination of the two first-class
constraints, the Anderson-Bergmann-Castellani gauge generator G, leaves E
unchanged. Likewise only that combination leaves the canonical action
invariant---an argument independent of observables. If one uses a first-class
constraint to generate instead a canonical transformation, one partly strips
the canonical coordinates of physical meaning as electromagnetic potentials,
vindicating the Anderson-Bergmann Lagrangian orientation of interesting
canonical transformations. The need to keep gauge-invariant q,t-dH/dp=-E-p=0
supports using the gauge generator and primary Hamiltonian rather than the
separate first-class constraints and the extended Hamiltonian.
  Partly paralleling Pons's criticism, it is shown that Dirac's proof that a
first-class primary constraint generates a gauge transformation, by comparing
evolutions from _identical_ initial data, cancels out and hence fails to detect
the alterations made to the initial state. It also neglects the arbitrary
coordinates multiplying the secondary constraints _inside_ the canonical
Hamiltonian. Thus the gauge-generating property has been ascribed to the
primaries alone.
  Hence the Dirac conjecture about secondary first-class constraints as
generating gauge transformations rests upon a false presupposition about
primary first-class constraints. Clarity about electromagnetism help with GR.

of the neutron star can be reached by the effect of the disk torques in the
long-term accretion phase (1-3 x 10^5 yrs). The currently ongoing X-ray
enhancement could be due to a transient accretion epoch, or the source could
still be in the accretion phase in quiescence. Considering these different
possibilities, we determine the model curves that could represent the long-term
rotational and the X-ray luminosity evolution of Swift J1822.3-1606, which
constrain the strength of the magnetic dipole field to the range of 1-2 x 10^12
G on the surface of the neutron star.

detect extended nuclear emission in at least 21% of the objects, while another
19% appear clearly point-like, and the remaining objects cannot be constrained.
Where present, elongated nuclear emission aligns with the ionization cones in
Seyferts. Subarcsecond resolution allows us to isolate the AGN emission on
scales of a few tens of parsecs and to obtain nuclear photometry in multiple
filters for the objects. Median spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for the
different optical AGN types are constructed and individual MIR 12 and 18micron
continuum luminosities are computed. These range over more than six orders of
magnitude. In comparison to the arcsecond-scale MIR emission as probed by
Spitzer, the continuum emission is much lower on subarcsecond scales in many
cases. The silicate feature strength is similar on both scales and generally
appears in emission (absorption) in type I (II) AGN. However, the polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbon emission appears weaker or absent on subarcsecond scales.
The differences of the MIR SEDs on both scales are particularly large for
AGN/starburst composites and close-by (and weak) AGN. The nucleus dominates
over the total emission of the galaxy only at luminosities >=10^(44)erg/s. The
AGN MIR atlas is well suited not only for detailed investigation of individual
sources but also for statistical studies of AGN unification.

the BH, and equations of state of dense matter, BH-NS mergers can eject more
material than NS-NS mergers. In such cases, radioactively powered emission from

show that, in spite of the expected larger distances to BH-NS merger events,
observed brightness of BH-NS mergers can be comparable to or even higher than

bounded degree of a planar polynomial vector field. Our approach is inspired by
an idea of Ferragut and Giacomini. We improve upon their work by proving that
rational first integrals can be computed via systems of linear equations
instead of systems of quadratic equations. This leads to a probabilistic
algorithm with arithmetic complexity $\bigOsoft(N^{2 \omega})$ and to a
deterministic algorithm solving the problem in $\bigOsoft(d^2N^{2 \omega+1})$
arithmetic operations, where $N$ denotes the given bound for the degree of the
rational first integral, and where $d \leq N$ is the degree of the vector
field, and $\omega$ the exponent of linear algebra. We also provide a fast
heuristic variant which computes a rational first integral, or fails, in
$\bigOsoft(N^{\omega+2})$ arithmetic operations. By comparison, the best
previous algorithm uses at least $d^{\omega+1}\, N^{4\omega +4}$ arithmetic
operations. We then show how to apply a similar method to the computation of
Darboux polynomials. The algorithms are implemented in a Maple package which is
available to interested readers with examples showing its efficiency.

also used EUV images from Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and magnetograms
from Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard Solar Dynamics Observatory,
and multi-channel microwave data from Nobeyama Radiopolarimeters (NoRP) and
Korean Solar Radio Burst Locator (KSRBL). We traced centroids of the microwave
source observed by NoRH 17 GHz during the flare and found two episodes of the
motion with several facts: 1) The microwave source moved systematically along
the flare-arcade, which was observed by the AIA 94 A in a direction parallel to
the neutral line. 2) The period of each episode was 5 min and 14 min,
respectively. 3) Estimated parallel speed was 34 km/s for the first episode and
22 km/s for the second episode. The spectral slope of microwave flux above 10
GHz obtained by NoRP and KSRBL was negative for both episodes, and for the last
phase of the second episodes, it was flat with the flux of 150 sfu. The
negative spectrum and the flat with high flux indicate that the gyrosynchrotron
emission from accelerated electrons was dominant during the source motions. The
sequential images from the AIA 304 A and 94 A channels revealed that there were
successive plasma eruptions and each eruption was initiated just before the
start time of the microwave sources motion. Based on the results, we suggest
that the microwave source motion manifests the displacement of the particle
acceleration site caused by plasma eruptions.

WR bubble presents similar spectral and morphological X-ray characteristics to

observed spectrum is soft, peaking at the N VII line emission at 0.5 keV with
additional line emission at 0.7 - 0.9 keV and a weak tail of harder emission up
to ~1.5 keV. This spectrum can be described by a two-temperature optically thin
plasma emission model (T_{1}~1.4x10^{6} K, T_{2}~7.4x10^{6} K). We confirm the
results of previous X-ray observations that no noticeable temperature
variations are detected in the nebula. The X-ray-emitting plasma is distributed
in three apparent morphological components: two caps along the tips of the
major axis and an extra contribution toward the northwest blowout not reported
in previous analysis of the X-ray emission toward this WR nebula. Using the
plasma model fits of the Chandra ACIS spectra for the physical properties of
the hot gas and the ROSAT PSPC image to account for the incomplete coverage of

structured output predictors. Recent work on max-margin supervised topic models
has successfully integrated it with Bayesian topic models to discover
discriminative latent semantic structures and make accurate predictions for
unseen testing data. However, the resulting learning problems are usually hard
to solve because of the non-smoothness of the margin loss. Existing approaches
to building max-margin supervised topic models rely on an iterative procedure
to solve multiple latent SVM subproblems with additional mean-field assumptions
on the desired posterior distributions. This paper presents an alternative
approach by defining a new max-margin loss. Namely, we present Gibbs max-margin
supervised topic models, a latent variable Gibbs classifier to discover hidden
topic representations for various tasks, including classification, regression
and multi-task learning. Gibbs max-margin supervised topic models minimize an
expected margin loss, which is an upper bound of the existing margin loss
derived from an expected prediction rule. By introducing augmented variables
and integrating out the Dirichlet variables analytically by conjugacy, we
develop simple Gibbs sampling algorithms with no restricting assumptions and no
need to solve SVM subproblems. Furthermore, each step of the
""augment-and-collapse"" Gibbs sampling algorithms has an analytical conditional
distribution, from which samples can be easily drawn. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements on time efficiency. The classification
performance is also significantly improved over competitors on binary,

opportunity to probe into the gravity theory through the redshift-space

spectra up to hexadecapole (ell=4), of the Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) sample in
the data release 7 (DR7) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey II (SDSS-II), we
obtain simultaneous constraints on the linear growth rate f, angular diameter
distance D_A, and Hubble parameter H at redshift z = 0.3. For this purpose, we
first extensively examine the validity of a theoretical model for the
non-linear RSDs using mock subhalo catalogues from N-body simulations, which
are constructed to match with the observed multipole power spectra. We show
that the input cosmological parameters of the simulations can be recovered well
within the error bars by comparing the multipole power spectra of our
theoretical model and those of the mock subhalo catalogues. We also carefully
examine systematic uncertainties in our analysis by testing the dependence on
prior assumption of the theoretical model and the range of wavenumbers to be
used in the fitting. These investigations validate that the theoretical model
can be safely applied to the real data. Thus, our results from the SDSS DR7 LRG
sample are robust including systematics of theoretical modeling; f(z = 0.3)
sigma_8(z = 0.3) =0.49+-0.08(stat.)+-0.04(sys.), D_A (z = 0.3)
=968+-42(stat.)+-17(sys.)[Mpc], H (z = 0.3)
=81.7+-5.0(stat.)+-3.7(sys.)[km/s/Mpc]. We believe that our method to constrain
the cosmological parameters using subhaloes catalogues will be useful for more
refined samples like CMASS and LOWZ catalogues in the Baryon Oscillation

couples independently generated multiscale basis functions in each coarse patch

tools (specifically, LP-branching) to FPT algorithms (e.g., Cygan et al., 2011;
Narayanaswamy et al., 2012). However, although interesting results have been
achieved, the methods require the underlying polytope to have very restrictive
properties (half-integrality and persistence), which are known only for few
problems (essentially Vertex Cover (Nemhauser and Trotter, 1975) and Node
Multiway Cut (Garg et al., 1994)). Taking a slightly different approach, we
view half-integrality as a \emph{discrete} relaxation of a problem, e.g., a
relaxation of the search space from $\{0,1\}^V$ to $\{0,1/2,1\}^V$ such that
the new problem admits a polynomial-time exact solution. Using tools from CSP
(in particular Thapper and \v{Z}ivn\'y, 2012) to study the existence of such
relaxations, we provide a much broader class of half-integral polytopes with
the required properties, unifying and extending previously known cases.
  In addition to the insight into problems with half-integral relaxations, our
results yield a range of new and improved FPT algorithms, including an
$O^*(|\Sigma|^{2k})$-time algorithm for node-deletion Unique Label Cover with
label set $\Sigma$ and an $O^*(4^k)$-time algorithm for Group Feedback Vertex

these significantly improve on previous results. The latter result also implies
the first single-exponential time FPT algorithm for Subset Feedback Vertex Set,

unimaginable a decade ago, the need for asteroseismic studies of individual
objects remains. This is primarily due to the limitations of single-colour
intensity variations, which are much less sensitive to certain asteroseismic
signals. The best way to obtain the necessary data is via very high resolution
ground-based spectrography. Such observations measure the perceived
radial-velocity shifts that arise due to stellar oscillations, which exhibit a
much better signal-to-noise ratio than those for intensity observations. SONG,
a proposed network of 1m telescopes with spectrographs that can reach
R=110,000, was designed with this need in mind. With one node under
commissioning in Tenerife and another under construction in China, an analysis
of the scientific benefits of constructing additional nodes for the network is
warranted. By convolving models of asteroseismic observables (mean densities,
small separations) with the anticipated window functions for different node
configurations, we explore the impact of the number of nodes in the SONG
network on the anticipated results, across the areas of the HR diagram where
solar-like oscillations are found. We find that although time series from two
SONG nodes, or in some cases even one node, will allow us to detect
oscillations, the full SONG network, providing full temporal coverage, is
needed for obtaining the science goals of SONG, including analysis of modes of
spherical harmonic degree l=3.

final evolutionary stage of the most massive stars. The characteristic strong O
vi emission possibly originates from an enhanced oxygen abundance in the
stellar wind. Alternatively, the O vi emission can be caused by the high
temperature of these stars, in which case the WO stars are the high-temperature
extension of the more common carbon sequence Wolf-Rayet (WC) stars. Aims. By
constraining the physical properties and evolutionary status of DR1, a WO star
in the low-metallicity Local Group dwarf galaxy IC 1613 and one of only two
objects of its class known in a SMC-like metallicity environment, we aim to
investigate the nature of WO stars and their evolutionary connection with WC
stars. Methods. We use the non-LTE atmosphere code cmfgen to model the observed
spectrum of DR1 and to derive its stellar and wind parameters. We compare our
values with other studies of WC and WO stars, as well as with the predictions
of evolutionary models. We also model the surrounding nebula using the
photo-ionization code cloudy. Results. The oxygen and carbon abundances that we
obtain are comparable to values found for WC stars. The temperature and
luminosity are, however, higher than those of WC stars. DR1 is embedded in the
hottest known H ii region in the Local Group. The nebular properties can be
consistently reproduced by cloudy models adopting DR1 as central ionizing
source. Conclusions. Comparison of the abundances and temperature of DR1 with
core helium-burning models show that DR1 is currently well into the second half
of helium burning. If the properties of DR1 are representative for the WO
class, it would imply that WO stars are the high-temperature and
high-luminosity extension of the WC stars, and do not necessarily represent a
later evolutionary stage.

are primarily observed by the SOHO/UVCS instrument in the ""hot"" Fe XVIII
{\lambda}974 {\AA} line and are usually interpreted as a signature of plasma
heating due to magnetic reconnection in the post-CME Current Sheet (CS).
Nevertheless, the physical process itself and the altitude of the main energy
release are currently not fully understood. In this work, we studied the
evolution of plasma heating after the CME of 2004 July 28 by comparing UV
spectra acquired by UVCS with soft X-ray (SXR) and hard X-ray (HXR)images of
the post-flare loops taken by GOES/SXI and RHESSI. The X-ray data show a
long-lasting extended source that is rising upwards, toward the
high-temperature source detected by UVCS. UVCS data show the presence of
significant non-thermal broadening in the CS (signature of turbulent motions)
and a strong density gradient across the CS region. The thermal energy released
in the HXR source is on the order of about 10^32 erg, a factor about 2-5 larger
than the energy required to explain the high-temperature plasma sampled by
UVCS. Nevertheless, the very different time evolutions of SXR and HXR sources
compared to the UV emission suggest that reconnection occurring above the
post-eruption arcades are not directly responsible for the high-temperature
plasma sampled higher up by UVCS. We conclude that an additional plasma heating
mechanism (such as turbulent reconnection) in the CS is likely required.

agents of a communication network initially supports an opinion (a color chosen
from a finite set $[k]$). Then, in every (synchronous) round, each agent can
revise his color according to the opinions currently held by a random sample of
his neighbors. It is assumed that the initial color configuration exhibits a
sufficiently large \emph{bias} $s$ towards a fixed plurality color, that is,
the number of nodes supporting the plurality color exceeds the number of nodes
supporting any other color by $s$ additional nodes. The goal is having the
process to converge to the \emph{stable} configuration in which all nodes
support the initial plurality. We consider a basic model in which the network
is a clique and the update rule (called here the \emph{3-majority dynamics}) of
the process is the following: each agent looks at the colors of three random
neighbors and then applies the majority rule (breaking ties uniformly).
  We prove that the process converges in time $\mathcal{O}( \min\{ k, (n/\log
n)^{1/3} \} \, \log n )$ with high probability, provided that $s \geqslant c
\sqrt{ \min\{ 2k, (n/\log n)^{1/3} \}\, n \log n}$.

plurality-consensus process and the \emph{median} process studied by Doerr et
al. in [ACM SPAA'11].
  A natural question is whether looking at more (than three) random neighbors
can significantly speed up the process. We provide a negative answer to this
question: In particular, we show that samples of polylogarithmic size can speed
up the process by a polylogarithmic factor only.

set $S$ of $k$ vertices of $G$, there exist $\ell$ internally disjoint rainbow
trees connecting $S$. This concept was introduced by Chartrand et. al., and
there have been very few related results about it. In this paper, We establish
a sharp threshold function for $rx_{k,\ell}(G_{n,p})\leq k$ and
$rx_{k,\ell}(G_{n,M})\leq k,$ respectively, where $G_{n,p}$ and $G_{n,M}$ are
the usually defined random graphs.

opportunistically use the spectrum licensed to a primary user (PU). On the
appearance of this PU on a specific frequency band, any SU occupying this band
should free it for PUs. Typically, SUs may collaborate to reduce the impact of
cognitive users on the primary network and to improve the performance of the
SUs. In this paper, we propose and analyze the performance of virtual
reservation in collaborative cognitive networks. Virtual reservation is a novel
link maintenance strategy that aims to maximize the throughput of the cognitive
network through full spectrum utilization. Our performance evaluation shows
significant improvements not only in the SUs blocking and forced termination
probabilities but also in the throughput of cognitive users.

cluster based tunable sleep transistor cell Power Gating, has been introduced
in the present paper with a few modifications. Furthermore, a detailed
comparison of its performance with some of the other conventional Power Gating
schemes; such as Cluster Based Sleep Transistor Design (CBSTD), Distributed
Sleep Transistor Network (DSTN) etc.; has also been presented here. Considering
the constraints of power consumption, performance, and the area overhead, while
doing the actual implementation of any Power Gating scheme, it becomes
important to deal with the various design issues like the proper sizing of the
sleep transistors (STs), controlling the voltage drop (IR drop) across the STs,
and obviously maintaining a desired performance with lower amount of delay
degradation. With this notion, we tried to find out an efficient Power Gating
strategy which can reduce the overall power consumption of any CMOS circuit by
virtue of reducing the standby mode leakage current. Taking the different
performance parameters into account, for an example circuit, which is actually
the conventional 4x4 multiplier design, we found that the modified tunable
sleep transistor cell Power Gating gives very much promising results. The
reported architecture of the 4x4 multiplier with the tunable sleep transistor
cell Power Gating, is designed using 45 nm technology and it consumes
1.3638x10-5 Watt of Average Power while being operated with the nominal case of
the bit configuration word, that is, 1000. ...........

have been extant when the Solar System formed over 4.5 billion years ago.
Identifying the sources of SLRs is important for understanding the timescales
of Solar System formation and processes that occurred early in its history.
Extinct 36Cl (t_1/2 = 0.301 Ma) is thought to have been produced by interaction
of solar energetic particles (SEPs), emitted by the young Sun, with gas and
dust in the nascent Solar System. However, models that calculate SLR production
in the early Solar System (ESS) lack experimental data for the 36Cl production
reactions. We present here the first measurement of the cross section of one of
the main 36Cl production reactions, 33S(\alpha,p)36Cl, in the energy range 0.70
- 2.42 MeV/A. The cross section measurement was performed by bombarding a
target and collecting the recoiled 36Cl atoms produced in the reaction,
chemically processing the samples, and measuring the 36Cl/Cl ratio of the
activated samples with accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). The experimental
results were found to be systematically higher than the cross sections used in
previous local irradiation models and other Hauser-Feshbach calculated
predictions. However, the effects of the experimentally measured cross sections
on the modeled production of 36Cl in the early Solar System were found to be
minimal. Reactions channels involving S targets dominate 36Cl production, but
the astrophysical event parameters can dramatically change each reactions'
relative contribution.

annealing methods in mind. Annealing methods are regarded as a general
technique to solve optimization problems efficiently. In annealing methods, we
introduce a controllable parameter which represents a kind of fluctuation and
decrease the parameter gradually. Annealing methods face with a difficulty when
a phase transition point exists during the protocol. Then, it is important to
develop a method to avoid the phase transition by introducing a new type of
fluctuation. By taking the Potts model for instance, we review a way to change
the phase transition nature. Although the method described in this paper does
not succeed to avoid the phase transition, we believe that the concept of the
method will be useful for optimization problems.

  Diffusion Imaging",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a Bayesian probabilistic model to estimate the brain white matter
atlas from high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) data. This model
incorporates a shape prior of the white matter anatomy and the likelihood of
individual observed HARDI datasets. We first assume that the atlas is generated
from a known hyperatlas through a flow of diffeomorphisms and its shape prior
can be constructed based on the framework of large deformation diffeomorphic
metric mapping (LDDMM). LDDMM characterizes a nonlinear diffeomorphic shape
space in a linear space of initial momentum uniquely determining diffeomorphic
geodesic flows from the hyperatlas. Therefore, the shape prior of the HARDI
atlas can be modeled using a centered Gaussian random field (GRF) model of the
initial momentum. In order to construct the likelihood of observed HARDI
datasets, it is necessary to study the diffeomorphic transformation of
individual observations relative to the atlas and the probabilistic
distribution of orientation distribution functions (ODFs). To this end, we
construct the likelihood related to the transformation using the same
construction as discussed for the shape prior of the atlas. The probabilistic
distribution of ODFs is then constructed based on the ODF Riemannian manifold.
We assume that the observed ODFs are generated by an exponential map of random
tangent vectors at the deformed atlas ODF. Hence, the likelihood of the ODFs
can be modeled using a GRF of their tangent vectors in the ODF Riemannian
manifold. We solve for the maximum a posteriori using the
Expectation-Maximization algorithm and derive the corresponding update
equations. Finally, we illustrate the HARDI atlas constructed based on a
Chinese aging cohort of 94 adults and compare it with that generated by
averaging the coefficients of spherical harmonics of the ODF across subjects.

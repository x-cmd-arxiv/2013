file diffusion to normal diffusion in fluids confined to narrow channels. We
show that the long time diffusion coefficients for a series of systems
involving hard and soft interaction potentials can be described in terms of a
hopping time that measures the time it takes for a particle to escape the cage
formed by its neighbors in the pore. Free energy barriers for the particle
hopping process are calculated and used to show that transition state theory
effectively describes the hopping time for all the systems studied, over a
range of pore diameters. Our work suggests that the combination of hopping
times and transition state theory offers a useful and general framework to
describe the dynamics of these highly confined fluids.

their structure and their interactions with impurities or thermal phonons.
However, in classical crystals, networks are usually random with impurities
often forming non-equilibrium clusters when their motion freezes at low
temperature. Helium provides unique advantages for the study of dislocations:
crystals are free of all but isotopic impurities, the concentration of these
can be reduced to the ppb level, and the impurities are mobile at all
temperatures and therefore remain in equilibrium with the dislocations. We have
achieved a comprehensive study of the mechanical response of 4He crystals to a
driving strain as a function of temperature, frequency and strain amplitude.
The quality of our fits to the complete set of data strongly supports our
assumption of string-like vibrating dislocations. It leads to a precise
determination of the distribution of dislocation network lengths and to
detailed information about the interaction between dislocations and both
thermal phonons and 3He impurities. The width of the dissipation peak
associated with impurity binding is larger than predicted by a simple Debye
model, and much of this broadening is due to the distribution of network
lengths.

application sectors. A recent UK governmental report asked: How good are
seasonal climate forecasts on a scale of 1-5 (where 5 is very good), and how
good can we expect them to be in 30 years time? Seasonal climate forecasts are
made from ensembles of integrations of numerical models of climate. We argue
that goodness should be assessed primarily in terms of the probabilistic
reliability of these ensemble-based forecasts and that a 5 should be reserved
for systems which are not only reliable overall, but where, in particular,
small ensemble spread is a reliable indicator of low ensemble forecast error.
We study the reliability of regional temperature and precipitation forecasts of
the current operational seasonal forecast system of the European Centre for
Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, universally regarded as a world leading
operational institute producing seasonal climate forecasts. A wide range of
goodness rankings, depending on region and variable (with summer forecasts of
rainfall over Northern Europe performing exceptionally poorly) is found.
Finally, we discuss the prospects of reaching 5 across all regions and

portable and efficient, it is natural to want to translate the former into the
latter. CPC is such a source-to-source translator for C programs, based on a
partial conversion into continuation-passing style (CPS conversion) of
functions annotated as cooperative.
  In this article, we study the application of the CPC translator to QEMU, an
open-source machine emulator which also uses annotated coroutine functions for
concurrency. We first propose a new type of annotations to identify functions
which never cooperate, and we introduce CoroCheck, a tool for the static
analysis and inference of cooperation annotations. Then, we improve the CPC
translator, defining CPS conversion as a calling convention for the C language,
with support for indirect calls to CPS-converted function through function
pointers. Finally, we apply CoroCheck and CPC to QEMU (750 000 lines of C
code), fixing hundreds of missing annotations and comparing performance of the
translated code with existing implementations of coroutines in QEMU.
  Our work shows the importance of static annotation checking to prevent actual
concurrency bugs, and demonstrates that CPS conversion is a flexible, portable,

also simultaneously construct the radio map with limited calibration. To design
this scheme, we employ a source data set that possesses the same spatial

this data set is then transferred to a limited number of calibration
fingerprints and one or several RSS observations with unknown locations, in
order to perform direct localization of these observations using manifold
alignment. We test two different source data sets, namely a simulated radio
propagation map and the environments plan coordinates. For moving users, we
exploit the correlation of their observations to improve the localization

coordinates achieve better results than the simulated radio maps, and a
negligible degradation with 70-85% reduction in calibration load.

DNA. In this work we explore the effect of sequence flexibility on
transcription factor-mediated DNA looping, by drawing on sequences identified
in nucleosome formation and ligase-mediated cyclization assays as being
especially favorable for or resistant to large deformations. We examine a
poly(dA:dT)-rich, nucleosome-repelling sequence that is often thought to belong
to a class of highly inflexible DNAs; two strong nucleosome positioning
sequences that share a set of particular sequence features common to
nucleosome-preferring DNAs; and a CG-rich sequence representative of high
G+C-content genomic regions that correlate with high nucleosome occupancy in
vivo. To measure the flexibility of these sequences in the context of DNA
looping, we combine the in vitro single-molecule tethered particle motion
assay, a canonical looping protein, and a statistical mechan- ical model that
allows us to quantitatively relate the looping probability to the looping free
energy. We show that, in contrast to the case of nucleosome occupancy, G+C
content does not positively correlate with looping probability, and that
despite sharing sequence features that are thought to determine nucleosome
affinity, the two strong nucleosome positioning sequences behave markedly
dissimilarly in the context of looping. Most surprisingly, the poly(dA:dT)-rich
DNA that is often characterized as highly inflexible in fact exhibits one of
the highest propensities for looping that we have measured.

local variation of properties caused by the presence of impurities and defects.
The effect of these impurities at the atomic scale can either embrittle or
strengthen grain boundaries within. Thus, it is imperative to understand the
energetics associated with segregation to design materials with desirable
properties. Here, molecular statics simulations were employed to analyze the
energetics associated with the segregation of various elements (He, H, C, P,
and V) to four <100> (Sigma 5 and 13 GBs) and six <110> (Sigma 3,9,and 11 GBs)
symmetric tilt grain boundaries in alpha-Fe. This knowledge is important for
designing stable interfaces in harsh environments. Simulation results show that
the local atomic arrangements within the GB region and the resulting structural
units have a significant influence on the magnitude of binding energies of the
impurity (interstitial and substitutional) atoms. This data also suggests that
the site-to-site variation of energies within a boundary is substantial.
Comparing the binding energies of all ten boundaries shows that the Sigma
3(112) boundary possesses a much smaller binding energy for all interstitial
and substitutional impurity atoms among the boundaries examined here.
Additionally, based on the Rice-Wang model, our total energy calculations show
that V has a significant beneficial effect on the Fe grain boundary cohesion,
while P has a detrimental effect on grain boundary cohesion, much weaker than H
and He. This is significant for applications where extreme environmental damage
generates lattice defects and grain boundaries act as sinks for both
interstitial and substitutional impurity atoms. This methodology provides us
with a tool to effectively identify the local as well as the global segregation
behavior which can influence the GB cohesion.

angular resolutions, and is suited to the analysis of 2D velocity fields in Ha
from Fabry-Perot spectroscopy, (though it is also applicable to fields in 21cm
emission from HI, or to CO emission lines). The observations are mainly from
the GHASP spectrometer data base, taken on the 1.93m telescope at Haute
Provence, plus some data from the GHaFaS spectrometer on the 4.2m WHT at La
Palma. We find clear indications of resonance effects in the disk velocity
fields of virtually all of the 104 galaxies. The number of resonance radii
detected ranges from one to seven, with a median of four. We have derived the
resonance curves: Omega, Omega+/-kappa/2, Omega+/-kappa/4 against radius for
all the galaxies, and used them to derive the ILR, the OLR, and the two 4:1
resonances for each corotation in each galaxy. This led us to discover a
pattern in over 70% of the sample: given two pattern speeds, say Omega1 and
Omega2, the OLR of Omega1 coincides with the corotation of Omega2, and the
inner 4:1 resonance of Omega2 coincides with the corotation of Omega1. Although
the second coincidence has been predicted, a prediction of this double
coincidence is not found in the literature. This pattern is found once in 42 of
the galaxies, twice in a further 26, three times in five, and even four times

where we have good enough image quality, finding a mean value of 1.3, and a
shallow increase towards later type galaxies.

flow regardless of the permutation length since the permutation engine is a
buffer whose leading element is swapped by other elements in the queue. The
principle goal of pruning is that of construction of variable length and hence
delay interleavers with application to iterative soft information processing
and concatenated codes, using the same structure (possibly in hardware) of the
interleaver and deinterleaver units. We address the issue of how pruning
impacts the spread of the permutation and also look at how pruning impacts
algebraically constructed permutations. We note that pruning via truncation of
the transposition vector of the permutation can have a catastrophic impact on
the permutation spread of algebraically constructed permutations. To remedy
this problem, we propose a novel lifting method whereby a subset of the points
in the permutation map leading to low spread of the pruned permutation are
identified and eliminated. Practical realization of this lifting is then
proposed via dummy symbol insertion in the input queue of the Finite State
Permuter (FSP), and subsequent removal of the dummy symbols at the FSP output.

are presented and discussed. Identity Products (IDs), structures fundamentally
related to entanglement, are defined and explored. The Kochen-Specker theorem
is proved by particular sets of IDs that we call KS sets. We also present a new
theorem that we call the $N$-qubit Kochen-Specker theorem, which is proved by
particular sets of IDs that we call NKS sets, and whose utility is that it
leads to efficient constructions for KS sets. We define the criticality, or
irreducibility, of these structures, and its connection to entanglement. All
representative critical IDs for up to $N=4$ qubits are presented, and numerous
families of critical IDs for arbitrarily large values of $N$ are discussed. The
critical IDs for a given $N$ are a finite set of geometric objects that appear
to fully characterize the nonclassicality of the $N$-qubit Pauli group. Methods
for constructing critical KS sets and NKS sets from IDs are given, and
experimental tests of entanglement, contextuality, and nonlocality are
discussed. Possible applications and connections to other work are also

households with energy storage systems as an intertemporal trading economy.
Intertemporal trade refers to transaction of goods across time when an agent,
at any time, is faced with the option of consuming or saving with the aim of
using the savings in the future or spending the savings from the past. Smart
homes define optimal consumption as either balancing/leveling consumption such
that the utility company is presented with a uniform demand or as minimizing
consumption costs by storing energy during off-peak time periods when prices
are lower and use the stored energy during peak time periods when prices are
higher. Due to the varying nature of energy requirements of household and
market energy prices over different time periods in a day, households face a
trade-off between consuming to meet their current energy requirements and/or
storing energy for future consumption and/or spending energy stored in the
past. These trade-offs or consumption preferences of the household are modeled
as utility functions using consumer theory. We introduce two different utility
functions, one for cost minimization and another for consumption
balancing/leveling, that are maximized subject to respective budget,
consumption, storage and savings constraints to solve for the optimum
consumption profile. The optimization problem of a household with energy
storage is formulated as a geometric program for consumption
balancing/leveling, while cost minimization is formulated as a linear
programming problem. Simulation results show that the proposed model achieves
extremely low peak to average ratio in the consumption balancing/leveling
scheme with about 8% reduction in consumption costs and the least possible
amount for electricity bill with about 12% reduction in consumption costs in
the cost minimization scheme.

incorporates an intrinsic dissipative length scale. The theory predicts that
the solutions to the flow rule are global minimizers of the functional for
energy dissipation. We prove that there are no global minimizers of the
functional, thus resolving a previously unsolved conjecture. Our result shows
that the variational formulation of the theory is unviable. The non-existence
of a global minimizer appears to be related to the formation of infinitely fine
plastic boundary layers.

Tonegawa et al., PRL 109, 036401 (2012)] provides another route besides quantum
oscillations to the determination of the bulk electronic structure in the
hidden order phase. We report detailed analyses of the resonance lines, which
fully resolve the cyclotron mass structure of the main Fermi surface sheets. A
particular focus is given to the anomalous splitting of the sharpest resonance
line near the [110] direction under in-plane magnetic-field rotation, which
implies peculiar electronic structure in the hidden order phase. The results
under the field rotation from [110] toward [001] direction reveal that the
splitting is a robust feature against field tilting from the basal plane. This
is in sharp contrast to the reported frequency branch alpha in the quantum
oscillation experiments showing a three-fold splitting that disappears by a
small field tilt, which can be explained by the magnetic breakdown between the
large hole sphere and small electron pockets. Our analysis of the cyclotron
resonance profiles reveals that the heavier branch of the split line has a
larger scattering rate, providing evidence for the existence of hot-spot
regions along the [110] direction. These results are consistent with the broken
fourfold rotational symmetry in the hidden-order phase, which can modify the
interband scattering in an asymmetric manner. We also extend our measurements
down to 0.7 K, which results in the observation of cyclotron resonance in the
superconducting state, where novel effects of vortex dynamics may enter. We
find that the cyclotron mass undergoes no change in the superconducting state.
In contrast, the quasiparticle scattering rate shows a rapid decrease below the
vortex-lattice melting transition temperature, which supports the formation of
quasiparticle Bloch state in the vortex lattice phase.

present a method for the construction of adaptive meshes in two spatial
dimensions using domain decomposition that is suitable for an implementation on
parallel computing architectures. The method uses the stochastic representation
of the exact solution of a linear mesh generator of Winslow type to find the
points of the adaptive mesh along the subdomain interfaces. The meshes over the
single subdomains can then be obtained completely independently of each other
using the probabilistically computed solutions along the interfaces as boundary
conditions for the linear mesh generator. Further to the previously
acknowledged performance characteristics, we demonstrate how the stochastic
domain decomposition approach is particularly suited to the problem of grid
generation - generating quality meshes efficiently. In addition we show further
improvements are possible using interpolation of the subdomain interfaces and
smoothing of mesh candidates. An optimal placement strategy is introduced to
automatically choose the number and placement of points along the interface

easily be arranged into long chains that exhibit mechanical properties
reminiscent of elastic strings or rods. While simple formulations exist for the
energy of a deformed elastic rod, it is not clear whether or not they are also
appropriate for a chain of spherical magnets. In this paper, we use
discrete-to-continuum asymptotic analysis to derive a continuum model for the
energy of a deformed chain of magnets based on the magnetostatic interactions
between individual spheres. We find that the mechanical properties of a chain
of magnets differ significantly from those of an elastic rod: while both
magnetic chains and elastic rods support bending by change of local curvature,
nonlocal interaction terms also appear in the energy formulation for a magnetic
chain. This continuum model for the energy of a chain of magnets is used to
analyse small deformations of a circular ring of magnets and hence obtain
theoretical predictions for the vibrational modes of a circular ring of
magnets. Surprisingly, despite the contribution of nonlocal energy terms, we
find that the vibrations of a circular ring of magnets are governed by the same
equation that governs the vibrations of a circular elastic ring.

control function (or functions) to interpolate between an initial and final
Hamiltonian, which helps to keep the system in the instantaneous ground state.
When the evolution time is finite, the degree of adiabaticity (quantified in
this work as the average ground-state population during evolution) depends on
the particulars of a dynamic trajectory associated with a given set of control
functions. We use quantum optimal control theory with a composite objective
functional to numerically search for controls that achieve the target final
state with a high fidelity while simultaneously maximizing the degree of
adiabaticity. Exploring properties of optimal adiabatic trajectories in model
systems elucidates the dynamic mechanisms that suppress unwanted excitations
from the ground state. Specifically, we discover that the use of multiple
control functions makes it possible to access a rich set of dynamic
trajectories, some of which attain a significantly improved performance (in
terms of both fidelity and adiabaticity) through the increase of the energy gap
during most of the evolution time.

study summary statistics which offer enough compression to be tractable, while
preserving a great deal of information. One well-studied summary is the site
frequency spectrum---the empirical distribution, across segregating sites, of
the sample frequency of the derived allele. However, most previous theoretical
work has assumed that each site has experienced at most one mutation event in
its genealogical history, which becomes less tenable for very large sample
sizes. In this work we obtain, in closed-form, the predicted frequency spectrum
of a site that has experienced at most two mutation events, under very general
assumptions about the distribution of branch lengths in the underlying
coalescent tree. Among other applications, we obtain the frequency spectrum of
a triallelic site in a model of historically varying population size. We
demonstrate the utility of our formulas in two settings: First, we show that
triallelic sites are more sensitive to the parameters of a population that has
experienced historical growth, suggesting that they will have use if they can
be incorporated into demographic inference. Second, we investigate a recently
proposed alternative mechanism of mutation in which the two derived alleles of
a triallelic site are created simultaneously within a single individual, and we
develop a test to determine whether it is responsible for the excess of
triallelic sites in the human genome.

simple model that the smaller gap is a gap from the impurity level to the

When the non-additive scaling limit is employed, the energy and the entropy
compete and the system exhibits some phase transitions. Such systems do not
satisfy the additivity, which results in some unfamiliar properties related to
phase transitions. In this paper, the concept of additivity and its consequence
are explained and the recent progress on statistical mechanics of long-range
interacting systems are reviewed. It is shown that the parameter space is
clearly decomposed into the three regions according to the stability of the
uniform state predicted by the mean-field theory. Based on this parameter space
decomposition, recent results on the exactness of MF theory are explained. When
the interaction is non-negative (ferromagnetic), the analysis of the mean-field
theory is exact and a typical spin configuration is always uniform in the
canonical ensemble. However, in the restricted canonical ensemble, i.e., the
canonical ensemble with a restriction of the value of the magnetization, it is
shown that the mean-field theory does not necessarily give the exact
description of the system and phase transitions between the mean-field uniform
states (MF phase) and the inhomogeneous states (non-MF phase) occur. A new
finding is that when the interaction potential changes its sign depending on
the distance, the non-MF phase appears even in the canonical ensemble.

magnetic fields along their flight to the Earth. Since continuum $\gamma$-ray
and antiproton productions are sufficiently suppressed in axion production, the
scenario fits the 130 GeV $\gamma$-ray line without conflicting with cosmic ray
measurements. We derive the axion production cross section and the decay rate
of dark matter to fit the $\gamma$-ray excess as functions of axion parameters.
In the scenario, the $\gamma$-ray spatial distributions depend on both the dark
matter profile and the magnetic field configuration, which will be tested by
future $\gamma$-ray observations, e.g., H.E.S.S. II, CTA, and GAMMA-400. As an
illustrative example, we study realistic supersymmetric axion models, and show

shape, and has a steep integrated-intensity gradient toward H II regions
G38.91-0.44 and G39.30-1.04, suggesting that the two H II regions have expanded

outflow and infall motions, indicating a newly forming massive star. We
detected a new collimated outflow in the clump compressed by G38.93-0.39. The
derived ages of the three H II regions are 6.1*10^5yr, 2.5*10^5yr, and
9.0*10^5yr, respectively. In the IRDC G38.95-0.47, the significant enhancement
of several Class I YSOs indicates the presence of some recently formed stars.
Comparing the ages of these H II regions with YSOs (Class I sources and massive

and G39.30-1.04 together, which supports the radiatively driven implosion

equivalent to $\Lambda \le 0$. Newman made the conjecture that $\Lambda \ge 0$
along with the remark that ""the new conjecture is a quantitative version of the
dictum that the Riemann hypothesis, if true, is only barely so.""
  Newman's conjecture is still unsolved, and previous work could only handle
the Riemann zeta function and quadratic Dirichlet $L$-functions, obtaining
lower bounds very close to zero (for example, for $\zeta(s)$ the bound is at
least $-1.14541 \cdot 10^{-11}$, and for quadratic Dirichlet $L$-functions it
is at least $-1.17 \cdot 10^{-7}$). We generalize the techniques to apply to
automorphic $L$-functions as well as function field $L$-functions. We further
determine the limit of these techniques by studying linear combinations of
$L$-functions, proving that these methods are insufficient.
  We explicitly determine the Newman constants in various function field
settings, which has strong implications for Newman's quantitative version of
RH. In particular, let $\mathcal D \in \bbZ[T]$ be a square-free polynomial of
degree 3. Let $D_p$ be the polynomial in $\bbF_p[T]$ obtained by reducing
$\mathcal D$ modulo $p$. Then the Newman constant $\Lambda_{D_p}$ equals $\log
\frac{|a_p(\mathcal D)|}{2\sqrt{p}}$; by Sato--Tate (if the curve is non-CM)
there exists a sequence of primes such that $\lim_{n \to\infty}

program which approximates its dynamic behaviour. A compositional program
analysis accomplishes this task with a divide-and-conquer strategy: the meaning
of a program is computed by dividing it into sub-programs, computing their
meaning, and then combining the results. Compositional program analyses are
desirable because they can yield scalable (and easily parallelizable) program
analyses.
  This paper presents algebraic framework for designing, implementing, and
proving the correctness of compositional program analyses. A program analysis
in our framework defined by an algebraic structure equipped with sequencing,
choice, and iteration operations. From the analysis design perspective, a
particularly interesting consequence of this is that the meaning of a loop is
computed by applying the iteration operator to the loop body. This style of
compositional loop analysis can yield interesting ways of computing loop
invariants that cannot be defined iteratively. We identify a class of
algorithms, the so-called path-expression algorithms [Tarjan1981,Scholz2007],
which can be used to efficiently implement analyses in our framework. Lastly,
we develop a theory for proving the correctness of an analysis by establishing
an approximation relationship between an algebra defining a concrete semantics

efficiency and its capacity. We define the efficiency and capacity of the
caching and suggest a method for their estimation based on the analysis of
kinds of the accessible memory.

the presence of long range Coulomb interactions. This model first appeared in
the early literature on charge order in magnetite. In the limit where the
interactions become short-ranged, the model has a ground state with an
extensive entropy and dipolar charge-charge correlations. When long range
interactions are introduced, the exact degeneracy is broken. We study the
thermodynamics of the model and show the presence of a correlated charge liquid
within a temperature window in which the physics is well described as a liquid
of screened charged defects. The structure factor in this phase, which has
smeared pinch points at the reciprocal lattice points, may be used to detect
charge ice experimentally. In addition, the model exhibits fractionally charged
excitations $\pm q/2$ which are shown to interact via a $1/r$ potential. At
lower temperatures, the model exhibits a transition to a long-range ordered
phase. We are able to treat the Coulombic charge ice model and the dipolar spin
ice model on an equal footing by mapping both to a constrained charge model on
the diamond lattice. We find that states of the two ice models are related by a
staggering field which is reflected in the energetics of these two models. From
this perspective we can understand the origin of the spin ice and charge ice
ground states as coming from a dipolar model on a diamond lattice. We study the
properties of charge ice in an external electric field finding that the
correlated liquid is robust to the presence of a field in contrast to the case
of spin ice in a magnetic field. Finally, we comment on the transport
properties of Coulombic charge ice in the correlated liquid phase.

dimension four. The transition temperature is established using a combination
of standard finite size scaling and of thermodynamic derivative peak data.
Measurements in the thermodynamic limit regime are analysed so as to estimate
critical exponents and confluent correction terms. Comparisons with results on
other 4d ISGs show that the susceptibility and correlation length critical
exponents $\gamma$ and $\nu$ depend on the form of the interaction
distribution. From this observation it can be deduced that critical exponents
are not universal in ISGs.

computed by a circuit with m gates, our algorithm requires each player to send

require each player to both send a number of messages and perform computation
that is {\Omega}(nm). Additionally, we define the threshold counting problem
and present a distributed algorithm to solve it in the asynchronous

communication and latency complexity of O(log n), and may be of independent
interest to other applications with a load balancing goal in mind.

within the framework of cooperative game theory. Specifically, we describe the
cost of each coalition as its maximin value. This represents the performance
that the coalition can guarantee itself, under any (including worst)
conditions. We then investigate fundamental solution concepts of the considered
cooperative game, namely the core and a variant of the min-max fair nucleolus.
  We consider two types of routing games based on the agents' Performance
Objectives, namely bottleneck routing games and additive routing games. For
bottleneck games we establish that the core includes all system-optimal flow
profiles and that the nucleolus is system-optimal or disadvantageous for the
smallest agent in the system. Moreover, we describe an interesting set of
scenarios for which the nucleolus is always system-optimal. For additive games,
we focus on the fundamental load balancing game of routing over parallel links.
We establish that, in contrary to bottleneck games, not all system-optimal flow
profiles lie in the core. However, we describe a specific system-optimal flow
profile that does lie in the core and, under assumptions of symmetry, is equal
to the nucleolus.

input based on an error signal locally projected onto the column space of the
graph Laplacian. This action allows agents to achieve a consensus or a
predetermined formation objective under constant or time-varying disturbances.
This study has analyzed the stability properties of this architecture and
provides several illustrative examples to demonstrate the proposed approach.

top-down view of the obstacles, the person and the nightstand. Pressure sensors
mounted beneath the bed-stand of the individual provide physical perception of
the person's state. A proximity IR sensor on the nightstand acts as a tactile
interface along with a Wii Nunchuck (Nintendo) to control mundane operations on
the nightstand. Intelligence from these three modalities are combined to enable
path planning for the nightstand to approach the individual. With growing
emphasis on assistive technology for the aging individuals who are increasingly

Thermal conductivity as a function of the temperature undergoes a smooth

point to fit experimental data is changing the way to perform the average on
the scattering rates. We apply the model to bulk Si with different isotopic
compositions obtaining an accurate fit. Then we calculate the thermal
conductivity of Si thin films and nanowires by only introducing the effective
size as additional parameter. The model provides a better prediction of the
thermal conductivity behavior valid for all temperatures and sizes above 30 nm

existing literature on agent-based models of political economy in the following
manner: (1) by introducing a new class of agents- oligarchs - that represent
leaders of firms in a common industry who lobby for beneficial subsidies
through campaign donations; and (2) by investigating the effects of ideological
preferences of the oligarchs on legislative action. We test hypotheses from the
literature in political economics on the behavior of oligarchs and political
parties as they interact, under conditions of imperfect information and bounded
rationality. Our key results indicate that (1) oligarchs tend to donate less to
political campaigns when the parties are more resistant to changing their
policies, or when voters are more informed; and (2) if Oligarchs donate to
parties based on a combination of ideological and profit motivations, Oligarchs
will tend to donate at a lower equilibrium level, due to the influence of lost
profits. We validate these outcomes via comparisons to real world polling data
on changes in party support over time.

composite sequences. Our PB sequences allow to produce flexible and tunable
nearly rectangular two-state inversion profiles as a function of the individual
pulse area because the width and the rectangularity of these profiles can be
adjusted at will. Moreover, these PB sequences suppress excitation around pulse
area $0$ and $2\pi$, and suppress deviations from complete population inversion
around pulse area $\pi$ to arbitrarily high orders. These features makes them a
valuable tool for high-fidelity qubit operations in the presence of relatively
strong amplitude noise. We construct two types of PB pulses:
$\mathcal{N}(\mathcal{B})$ in which a broadband pulse is nested into a
narrowband pulse, and $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{N})$ in which a narrowband pulse is
nested into a broadband pulse; the latter sequences deliver narrower profiles.
We derive exact analytic formulas for the composite phases of the PB pulses and
exact analytic formulas for the inversion profiles. These formulas allow an
easy estimation of the experimental resources needed for any desired qubit

complexes embedded in dark filamentary shock fronts connected with spiral arms.
The associated cloud masses are ~10^7 Msun. The conditions required to make
such complexes are explored, including gravitational instabilities in spiral
shocked gas and compression of incident clouds. We find that instabilities are
too slow for a complete collapse of the observed spiral filaments, but they
could lead to star formation in the denser parts. Compression of incident
clouds can produce a faster collapse but has difficulty explaining the
semi-regular spacing of some regions along the arms. If gravitational
instabilities are involved, then the condensations have the local Jeans mass.

establish the global existence of entropy solutions when the total variation of

less than 4 m/s to 135 m/s, yet the stars all have amplitudes of photometric
variability less than 3 mmag, reflecting the preference of the RV program for
chromospherically ""quiet"" stars. Despite the small size of our sample, we find
with high statistical significance that the RV RMS manifests strongly in the
Fourier power spectrum of the light curve: stars that are noisier in RV have a
greater number of frequency components in the light curve. We also find that
spot models of the observed light curves systematically underpredict the
observed RV variations by factors of ~2--1000, likely because the low level
photometric variations in our sample are driven by processes not included in
simple spot models. The stars best fit by these models tend to have simpler
light curves, dominated by a single relatively high amplitude component of
variability. Finally, we demonstrate that the RV RMS behavior of our sample can
be explained in the context of the photometric variability evolutionary diagram
introduced by Bastien et al. (2013). We use this diagram to derive the surface
gravities of the stars in our sample, revealing many of them to have moved off
the main-sequence. More generally, we find that the stars with the largest RV
RMS are those that have evolved onto the ""flicker floor"" sequence in that
diagram, characterized by relatively low amplitude but highly complex
photometric variations which grow as the stars evolve to become subgiants.

ionized impurity scattering. When the charged impurity densities are reduced,
remote optical phonon scattering will determine the ceiling of the highest
mobilities attainable in these ultrathin materials at room temperature. The
intrinsic mobilities will be accessible only in clean suspended layers, as is
also the case for graphene. Based on the study, we identify the best choices

(SNe) of Type I b/c, which have been associated with long-duration gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs). An ""off-axis"" GRB burst (i.e. whose relativistic jet points away
from us) is expected to have late-time radio emission even in the absence of
significant prompt gamma-ray emission. From our sample, we detected only SN
2003gk with an 8.4-GHz flux density of $2260 \pm 130 \,\mu$Jy. Our subsequent
VLBI observations of SN 2003gk, at an age of $\sim$8 yr, allowed us to
determine its radius to be $(2.4 \pm 0.4) \times 10^{17}$ cm, or $94 \pm 15$
light days. This radius rules out relativistic expansion as expected for an
off-axis GRB jet, and instead suggests an expansion speed of $\sim 10\:000$ km
s$^{-1}$ typical for non-relativistic core-collapse supernovae. We attribute
the late-onset radio emission to interaction of the ejecta with a dense shell
caused by episodic mass-loss from the progenitor.
  In addition, we present new calculations for the expected radio lightcurves
from GRB jets at various angles to the line of sight, and compare these to our
observed limits on the flux densities of the remainder of our SN sample. From
this comparison we can say that only a fraction of broadlined Type I b/c SNe
have a radio-bright jet similar to those seen for GRB afterglows at
cosmological distances. However, we also find that for a reasonable range of
parameters, as might be representative of the actual population of GRB events
rather than the detected bright ones, the radio emission from the GRB jets can
be quite faint, and that at present, radio observations do not place strong
constraints on off-axis GRB jets.

i) A thick shell becomes a thin shell. ii) Any shape become spherical. Such
focusing character of AdS, for the collapse of dusts, leads to the rapid
thermalization mechanism in strongly interacting system. For the collapse of a
wave, it explains the cascade of energy to UV through repeated bounces, which
has been extensively discussed in recent numerical works. Therefore the
focusing is the physical mechanism of instability of AdS. Such sharp contrast
between the dust and wave in collapse, together with the experimental
observation of rapid thermalization, suggest that the initial condition of
created particles in RHIC is in a state with random character rather than a
coherent one. Two time scales, one for thermalization and the other for
hydro-nization are defined and calculated in terms of the total mass density
and energy distribution of the initial particles. We find $t_{th}\sim
(1-c_1/E^2)^{1/2}/T $ so that softer modes thermalize earlier. However, for
hydro-nization, $t_{hyd} \sim 1/E^{2/3}T^{1/3}$ therefore harder modes come
earlier. We also show that near horizon limit of Dp brane solutions have
similar focusing effect which is enough to guarantee the early thermalization.

by McMullen's Arithmetic Chaos Conjecture regarding low-lying closed geodesics
on the modular surface defined over a given number field, we study the set of
traces for certain sub-semi-groups of SL2(Z) corresponding to absolutely
Diophantine numbers. In particular, we are concerned with the level of
distribution for this set. While the standard Affine Sieve procedure, combined
with Bourgain-Gamburd-Sarnak's resonance-free region for the resolvent of a
""congruence"" transfer operator, produces some exponent of distribution alpha >
0, we are able to produce the exponent alpha < 1/3. This recovers
unconditionally the same exponent as what one would obtain under a
Ramanujan-type conjecture for thin groups. A key ingredient, of independent
interest, is a bound on the additive energy of SL2(Z).

of the MFPT in the energy-diffusion controlled regime with a power-law
distribution. We discuss the finite barrier effect (i.e. thermal energy is not
small with respect to the potential barrier) and compare it with the Kramers
infinite barrier result both in the power-law distribution and in a
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. It is shown that the MFPT with the power-law
distribution extends the Kramers' low damping result to the relatively low
barrier. We pay attention to the energy-diffusion controlled regime which is of
great interest in the context of Josephson junctions, and study how the
power-law parameter affects the current distribution function in the experiment
of Josephson junctions.

accounts for the way a jet is defined in experiment and treated in available
full next-to-leading order calculations, (2) It includes the three leading
classes of logarithmic terms in the perturbative expansion, and (3) It is
adapted to the full kinematics in jet transverse momentum and rapidity relevant

characteristics of anti-rumor dynamics are explored by both mean-field

study are the timing effect of combating rumor and the identification of
influential nodes, which are what an efficient strategy against rumor may
concern about. The results indicate that, there exists robust time dependence
of anti-rumor dynamics and the timing threshold emerges as a consequence of
launching the anti-rumor at different delay time after the beginning of rumor
spreading. The timing threshold as a critical feature is further verified on a
series of Barabasi-Albert scale-free networks (BA networks), where anti-rumor
dynamics arises explicitly. The timing threshold is a network-dependent
quantity and its value decreases as the average degree of the BA network
increases until close to zero. Meanwhile, coreness also constitutes a better
topological descriptor to identify hubs. Our results will hopefully be useful
for the understanding of spreading behaviors of rumor and anti-rumor and
suggest a possible avenue for further study of interplays of multiple pieces of
information on complex network.

interaction with a light one. The main motivation is the detailed description
of the loss of coherence induced on a quantum system (in our model, the heavy
particle) by the interaction with the environment (the light particle). The
content of the paper is analytical and numerical. Concerning the analytical
contribution, we show that an approximate description of the dynamics of the
heavy particle can be carried out in two steps: first comes the interaction,
then the free evolution. In particular, all effects of the interaction can be
embodied in the action of a collision operator that acts on the initial state
of the heavy particle. With respect to previous analytical results on the same
topics, we turn our focus from the M{\o}ller wave operator to the full
scattering operator, whose analysis proves to be simpler. Concerning the
numerical contribution, we exploit the previous analysis to construct an
efficient numerical scheme that turns the original, multiscale, two-body
problem in two one-body problems which can be solved separately. This leads to
a considerable gain in simulation time. We present and interpret some
simulations carried out on specific one-dimensional systems by using the new
scheme. Finally, we propose a new description of the mechanism of decoherence
induced by scattering: decoherence is produced by an interference-free bump
which arises from the initial state of the heavy particle immediately after the
collision. We support such a picture by numerical evidence as well as by an
approximation theorem.

ultra-high energy particle collisions. Such a discussion is limited to the
spacetimes containing a single black hole so far. We deal with the
Majumdar-Papapetrou solution representing a system consisting of two identical
black holes in the equilibrium. In order to identify the conditions suitable
for the process of high energy collisions, we consider particles confined to
move on the equatorial plane towards the axis of symmetry with the zero angular
momentum. We consider collision between the particles moving in opposite
directions at the location midway between the black holes on the axis. We show
that the center of mass energy of collision between the particles increases
with the decrease in the separation between the black holes and shows
divergence in the limit where the separation goes to zero. We estimate the size
of the region close to the central point on the equatorial plane where it would
be possible to have high energy collisions and show that this region has a
reasonably large spatial extent. We further explore the process of high energy
collisions with the general geodesics with arbitrary angular momentum on the
equatorial plane away from the central point. Although in this paper we deal
with theMajumdar-Papapetrou spacetime which serves as a toy example
representing multiple black holes, we speculate on the possibility that the
ultra-high energy collisions would also occur in the more general setting like
colliding black holes, when distance between the black holes is extremely
small, which can in principle be verified in the numerical relativity
simulations.

the parameter $A_\Gamma$ is presented using a data sample of $pp$ collisions,
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.0 fb$^{-1}$, collected with the
LHCb detector and recorded at the centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV at the LHC.
The parameter $A_\Gamma$ is the asymmetry of the effective lifetimes measured
in decays of $D^0$ and $\bar{D}^0$ mesons to the CP eigenstates $K^-K^+$ and
$\pi^-\pi^+$. Fits to the data sample yield
$A_\Gamma(KK)=(-0.35\pm0.62\pm0.12)\times 10^{-3}$ and
$A_\Gamma(\pi\pi)=(0.33\pm1.06\pm0.14)\times 10^{-3}$, where the first
uncertainties are statistical and the second systematic. The results represent
the world's best measurements of these quantities. They show no difference in
$A_\Gamma$ between the two final states and no indication of CP violation.

decomposition. Our algorithm uses random projections type techniques to
efficiently compute a low rank approximation of large matrices. The randomized
LU algorithm can be parallelized and further accelerated by using sparse random
matrices in its projection step. Several different error bounds are proven for
the algorithm approximations. To prove these bounds, recent results from random
matrix theory related to subgaussian matrices are used. As an application, we
also show how the algorithm can be utilized to solve problems such as the
rank-deficient least squares problem. Numerical examples, which illustrate the
performance of the algorithm and compare it to other decomposition methods, are

S}_t$ is a $t$-semiarc if the number of tangent lines to ${\cal S}_t$ at each
of its points is $t$. If ${\cal S}_t$ is a $t$-semiarc in $\Pi_q$, $t<q$, then
each line intersects ${\cal S}_t$ in at most $q+1-t$ points. Dover proved that
semiovals (semiarcs with $t=1$) containing $q$ collinear points exist in
$\Pi_q$ only if $q<3$. We show that if $t>1$, then $t$-semiarcs with $q+1-t$
collinear points exist only if $t\geq \sqrt{q-1}$. In $\mathrm{PG}(2,q)$ we
prove the lower bound $t\geq(q-1)/2$, with equality only if ${\cal S}_t$ is a
blocking set of R\'edei type of size $3(q+1)/2$.
  We call the symmetric difference of two lines, with $t$ further points
removed from each line, a $V_t$-configuration. We give conditions ensuring a
$t$-semiarc to contain a $V_t$-configuration and give the complete
characterization of such $t$-semiarcs in $\mathrm{PG}(2,q)$.

consistency among replicated data in a timely fashion. While the consistent
ordering of events has been extensively researched, the time span to reach a
consistent state is mostly considered an effect of the chosen consistency
model, rather than being considered a parameter itself. This paper argues that
it is possible to give guarantees on the timely consistency of an operation.
Subsequent to an update the cloud and all connected clients will either be
consistent with the update within the defined upper bound of time or the update
will be returned. This paper suggests the respective algorithms and protocols
capable of producing such comprehensive Timed Consistency, as conceptually
proposed by Torres-Rojas et al. The solution offers business customers an
increasing level of predictability and adjustability. The temporal certainty
concerning the execution makes the cloud a more attractive tool for
time-critical or mission-critical applications fearing the poor availability of
Strong Consistency in cloud environments.

correlations in pseudorapidity distribution of secondary particles on the base
of analysis of individual interaction of nuclei of $^{197}Au$ at energy 10.7
AGeV with photoemulsion nuclei, is carried out. Events with long-range
multiparticle correlations (LC), short-range multiparticle correlations (SC)
and mixed type (MT) in pseudorapidity distribution of secondary particles, are
selected by Hurst method in accordance of Hurst curve behavior. These types
have significantly different characteristics. At first, they have different
parameters of fragmentation. Events of LC type are processes of full
destruction of projectile nucleus, in which multicharge fragments are absent.
In events of mixed type several multicharge fragments of projectile nucleus are
discovered. Secondly, these two types have significantly different multiplicity
distribution. Mean multiplicity of LC type events is significantly more than in
events of mixed type.
  On the basis of research of dependence of multiplicity versus target-nuclei
fragments number for events of various types it is revealed, that the most
considerable multiparticle correlations are observed in interactions of mixed
type, which correspond to the central collisions of gold nuclei and nuclei of
CNO-group, i.e. nuclei with strongly asymmetric volume, nuclear mass, charge,
etc. Such events are characterised by full destruction of target-nucleus and
disintegration of projectile-nucleus on several multi-charged fragments.

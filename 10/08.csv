and studied in the sequential setting. This new model, termed {\em controlled
Markovian observation} model, exhibits a more complicated memory structure in
the controlled observations than existing models. In addition, instead of
penalizing just the delay until the final decision time as in standard
sequential hypothesis testing problems, a much more general cost structure is
considered which entails accumulating the total control cost with respect to an
arbitrary control cost function. An asymptotically optimal test is proposed for
this new model and is shown to satisfy an {\em optimality} condition formulated
in terms of decision making risk. It is shown that the optimal causal control
policy for the controlled sensing problem is self-tuning, in the sense of
maximizing an inherent ""inferential"" reward simultaneously under every
hypothesis, with the maximal value being the best possible corresponding to the
case where the true hypothesis is known at the outset. Another test is also
proposed to meet {\em distinctly predefined} constraints on the various
decision risks {\em non-asymptotically,} while retaining asymptotic optimality.

multi-wavelength light curve properties of PSR B1821-24 at the milliperiod

peaks, separated by 0.41$\pm$0.02 in phase, with the first gamma-ray peak
lagging the first radio peak by 0.05$\pm$0.02 in phase, consistent with the
phase of giant radio pulses. We observe significant emission in the off-peak
interval of PSR B1821-24 with a best-fit LAT position inconsistent with the
core of M28. We do not detect significant gamma-ray pulsations at the spin or
orbital periods from any other known pulsar in M28, and we place limits on the
number of energetic pulsars in the cluster. The derived gamma-ray efficiency,
~2%, is typical of other gamma-ray pulsars with comparable spin-down power,
suggesting that the measured spin-down rate ($2.2\times10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$)
is not appreciably distorted by acceleration in the cluster potential. This
confirms PSR B1821-24 as the second very energetic millisecond pulsar in a

hydrodynamical and RT codes are based on a Voronoi tessellation of the spatial
domain. Such an unstructured grid poses new challenges in laying down the rays
(straight paths) needed in RT codes. We show that it is straightforward to
implement accurate and efficient RT on 3D Voronoi grids. We present a method
for computing straight paths between two arbitrary points through a 3D Voronoi
grid in the context of a RT code. We implement such a grid in our RT code
SKIRT, using the open source library Voro++ to obtain the relevant properties
of the Voronoi grid cells based solely on the generating points. We compare the
results obtained through the Voronoi grid with those generated by an octree
grid for two synthetic models, and we perform the well-known Pascucci RT
benchmark using the Voronoi grid. The presented algorithm produces correct
results for our test models. Shooting photon packages through the geometrically
much more complex 3D Voronoi grid is only about three times slower than the
equivalent process in an octree grid with the same number of cells, while in
fact the total number of Voronoi grid cells may be lower for an equally good
representation of the density field. We conclude that the benefits of using a
Voronoi grid in RT simulation codes will often outweigh the somewhat slower
performance.

mapping the massive MIMO system to a lattice. We show that the eavesdropper's
decoder for the MIMO system with M-PAM modulation is equivalent to solving
standard lattice problems that are conjectured to be of exponential complexity

conjecture that standard lattice problems are hard to solve in the worst-case,
the proposed encryption scheme has a more robust notion of security than that

dedicated to Riemann, Ahlfors and Rohlin. Yet, as its contents evolved as
mostly independent (due to our inaptitude to interconnect both trends as
strongly as we wished), it seemed preferable to publish it separately. More
factually, our account is an attempt to get familiarized with the current
consensus about Hilbert's 16th in degree 8. This is a nearly finished piece of
mathematics, thanks heroic breakthroughs by Viro, Fiedler, Korchagin, Shustin,
Chevallier, Orevkov, yet still leaving undecided six tantalizing bosons among a
menagerie of 104 logically possible distributions of ovals (respecting
B\'ezout, Gudkov periodicity, and the Fiedler-Viro imparity law sieving away
4+36 schemes). This quest inevitably involves glimpsing deep into the nebula
referrable to as Viro's patchworking, and the likewise spectacular
obstructional laws of Fiedler, Viro, Shustin, Orevkov. In the overall, the game
is much comparable to a pigeons hunting video-game, where 144 birds are
liberated in nature, with some of them strong enough to fly higher and higher
in the blue sky as to rejoin the stratospheric paradise of eternal life
(construction of a scheme in the algebro-geometric category). Some other, less
fortunate, birds were killed (a long time ago) and crashed down miserably over
terrestrial crust (prohibition). Alas, the hunt is unfinished with still six
birds, apparently too feeble to rally safely the paradise, yet too acrobatic
for any homosapiens being skillful enough to shoot them down.

these spin chains for arbitrary N into translationally invariant forms that all
allow exact solution by the means of a Jordan-Wigner transformation. For odd N
our models generalize the phase diagram of the transverse field Ising chain,
the simplest model in our hierarchy. For even N the models can be viewed as
longer ranger generalizations of the XY chain, the next model in the hierarchy.

critical points goes beyond exactly solvable models. Applying the same strategy
to the Blume-Capel model, a spin-1 generalization of the Ising chain in a
generic magnetic field, we construct another critical spin-1 chain with the

implicit transaction costs. We extend the existing theory to include the more
realistic possibility that the price at which the investors trade is dependent
on the traded volume. The investors in the market always buy at the ask and
sell at the bid price. Implicit transaction costs are composed of two terms,
one is able to capture the bid-ask spread, and the second the price impact.
Moreover, a new definition of a self-financing portfolio is obtained. The
self-financing condition suggests that continuous trading is possible, but is
restricted to predictable trading strategies having c\'adl\'ag
(right-continuous with left limits) and c\'agl\'ad (left-continuous with right
limits) paths of bounded quadratic variation and of finitely many jumps. That
is, c\'adl\'ag and c\'agl\'ad predictable trading strategies of infinite
variation, with finitely many jumps and of finite quadratic variation are
allowed in our setting. Restricting ourselves to c\'agl\'ad predictable trading
strategies, we show that the existence of an equivalent probability measure is
equivalent to the absence of arbitrage opportunities, so that the first
fundamental theorem of asset pricing (FFTAP) holds. It is also shown that the
use of continuous and bounded variation trading strategies can improve the
efficiency of hedging in a market with implicit transaction costs. To better
understand how to apply the theory proposed we provide an example of an
implicit transaction cost economy that is linear and non-linear in the order
size.

of asymmetric cavities, interacting through a hard-core potential. When a force
is applied in opposite directions a difference in the drift velocity of the
particles inside the cavity can be observed. Previous works on similar systems
deal with the low concentration regime, in which the interaction is irrelevant.
In this case it was found that large particles show a stronger asymmetry in the
drift velocity when a small force is applied, allowing for the separation of
different size particles (Reguera et al., Phys. Rev. Lett 108, 020604, 2012).
We found that when the interaction between particles is considered, the
behavior of the system is substantially different. For example, as
concentration is increased, the small particles are the ones that show a
stronger asymmetry. For the case where all the particles in the system are of
the same size we took advantage of the particle-vacancy analogy to predict that
the left and right currents are almost equal in a region around the

for the analysis of X-ray observations of galaxy clusters. We illustrate the
use of Bayes-X by analysing a set of four simulated clusters at z=0.2-0.9 as
they would be observed by a Chandra-like X-ray observatory. In both the
simulations and the analysis pipeline we assume that the dark matter density
follows a spherically-symmetric Navarro, Frenk and White (NFW) profile and that
the gas pressure is described by a generalised NFW (GNFW) profile. We then
perform four sets of analyses. By numerically exploring the joint probability
distribution of the cluster parameters given simulated Chandra-like data, we
show that the model and analysis technique can robustly return the simulated
cluster input quantities, constrain the cluster physical parameters and reveal
the degeneracies among the model parameters and cluster physical parameters. We
then analyse Chandra data on the nearby cluster, A262, and derive the cluster
physical profiles. To illustrate the performance of the Bayesian model
selection, we also carried out analyses assuming an Einasto profile for the
matter density and calculated the Bayes factor. The results of the model
selection analyses for the simulated data favour the NFW model as expected.

affected by the recently identified possibility of C flame quenching by
convective boundary mixing. We present first results of our study of the
combined effect of these two potential sources of uncertainty on the SN Ia
progenitor evolution. We consider the possibility that the CBR is higher than
its currently recommended value by as much as a factor of 1000 if unidentified
resonances are important, or that it is significantly lower because of the
hindrance effect. For stellar models that assume the Schwarzschild boundary for
convection, the maximum initial mass for the formation of CO WDs increases from
M_i ~ 5.5 Msun for the CBR factor of 1000 to M_i > 7.0 Msun for the CBR factor
of 0.01. For C-flame quenching models, hybrid C-O-Ne WDs form for a range of
initial mass of Delta M_i ~ 1 Msun, which increases a fraction of stars that
form WDs capable of igniting C in a thermonuclear runaway. The most extreme
case is found for the CBR factor of 0.1 that is supported by the hindrance
model. This nuclear physics assumption, combined with C flame quenching, leads
to the formation of a hybrid C-O-Ne WD with a mass of 1.3 Msun. Such WDs do not
need to accrete much mass to reach the Chandrasekhar limit.

states we confirm an approximately exponential decay of Hbar over five periods.
For a superposition of only the first four energy states we are able to
calculate Hbar(t) over 50 periods. We find that, depending on the set of phases
in the initial wave function, Hbar can decay to a large nonequilibrium residue
exceeding 10% of its initial value or it can become indistinguishable from zero
(the equilibrium value). We show that a large residue in Hbar is caused by a
tendency for the trajectories to be confined to sub-regions of configuration
space for some wave functions, and that this is less likely to occur for larger
numbers of energy states (if the initial phases are chosen randomly). Possible
cosmological implications are briefly discussed.

superiority of EOMs versus ordinary operational matrices (OOMs). Up to now, a
few studies have been conducted on EOMs and the differential equations solved
by them do not have high-degree nonlinearity and the reported results are not
regarded as appropriate criteria for the excellence of the new method. So, we
chose Emden-Fowler type differential equations and solved them by this method.
To confirm the accuracy of the new method and to show the preeminence of EOMs
versus OOMs, the norm1 of the residual and error function of both methods are
evaluated for multiple $m$ values, where $m$ is the degree of the Bernstein
polynomials. We reported the results in form of plots to illustrate the error
convergence of both methods to zero and also to show the primacy of the new
method versus OOMs. The obtained results have demonstrated the increased
accuracy of the new method.

citizenship for any individual who is Jewish and whose ancestors were expelled

It would seem that this policy targets a small subset of the global Jewish
population, i.e., restricted to individuals who retain cultural practices
associated with ancestral origins in Spain. However, the central contribution
of this manuscript is to demonstrate how and why the policy is far more likely
to apply to a very large fraction (i.e., the vast majority) of Jews. This claim
is supported using a series of genealogical models that include transmissable
""identities"" and preferential intra-group mating. Model analysis reveals that
even when intra-group mating is strong and even if only a small subset of a
present-day population retains cultural practices typically associated with
that of an ancestral group, it is highly likely that nearly all members of that
population have direct geneaological links to that ancestral group, given
sufficient number of generations have elapsed. The basis for this conclusion is
that not having a link to an ancestral group must be a property of all of an
individual's ancestors, the probability of which declines (nearly)
superexponentially with each successive generation. These findings highlight
unexpected incongruities induced by genealogical dynamics between present-day
and ancestral identities.

our D<6kpc absorbers are consistent with the Wr(2796) distributions of the

sight-lines of intermediate redshift galaxies with 6<D<25kpc have an equivalent
width distribution similar to that of the Milky Way halo, implying that beyond

inferred by the Milky Way and our new data, the gas profiles of galaxies can be
fit by a single log-linear Wr(2796)-D relation out to large scales across a
variety of gas-phase conditions and is maintained through the

confirm that the metallicity and azimuthal velocity distribution functions of

an extended metallicity tail going at least down to [M/H]=-2 dex, contributing
roughly at 3% of the entire thick disc population and having a shorter
scale-length compared to the canonical thick disc. The mean azimuthal velocity
of these metal-poor stars allows us to estimate the correlation between the
metallicity and the orbital velocity, which is an important constraint on the
formation mechanisms of the Galactic thick disc. Given our simple approach, we
find dVphi/d[M/H] ~ 50 km/s/dex, which is in a very good agreement with
previous literature values. We complete the study with a brief discussion on
the implications of the formation scenarios for the thick disc, and suggest
that given the above mentioned characteristics, a thick disc mainly formed by

holes (SMBHs) are growing substantially through rapid accretion of gas. Many
popular models of the co-evolutionary growth of galaxies and SMBHs predict that
QSOs are also sites of substantial recent star formation, mediated by important
processes, such as major mergers, which rapidly transform the nature of
galaxies. A detailed study of the star-forming properties of QSOs is a critical
test of such models. We present a far-infrared Herschel/PACS study of the mean
star formation rate (SFR) of a sample of spectroscopically observed QSOs to z~2
from the COSMOS extragalactic survey. This is the largest sample to date of
moderately luminous AGNs studied using uniform, deep far-infrared photometry.
We study trends of the mean SFR with redshift, black hole mass, nuclear
bolometric luminosity and specific accretion rate (Eddington ratio). To
minimize systematics, we have undertaken a uniform determination of SMBH
properties, as well as an analysis of important selection effects within
spectroscopic QSO samples that influence the interpretation of SFR trends. We
find that the mean SFRs of these QSOs are consistent with those of normal
massive star-forming galaxies with a fixed scaling between SMBH and galaxy mass
at all redshifts. No strong enhancement in SFR is found even among the most
rapidly accreting systems, at odds with several co-evolutionary models.
Finally, we consider the qualitative effects on mean SFR trends from different
assumptions about the star-forming properties of QSO hosts and redshift
evolution of the SMBH-galaxy relationship. While limited currently by
uncertainties, valuable constraints on AGN-galaxy co-evolution can emerge from
our approach.

conveyed by the accreting gas. Accreting gas streams provide fuel for star
formation, but they stir the disk and increase turbulence above the usual
levels compatible with gravitational instability, reducing the star formation
efficiency in the available gas. After the specific inflow rate has
sufficiently decreased - typically at z < 3 - galaxies settle in a
self-regulated regime with efficient star formation. An analytic model shows
that this interaction between infalling gas and young galaxies can
significantly delay star formation and maintain high gas fractions (>40%) down
to z = 2, in contrast to other galaxy formation models. Idealized hydrodynamic
simulations of infalling gas streams onto primordial galaxies confirm the
efficient energetic coupling at z > 2, and suggest that this effect is largely
under-resolved in existing cosmological simulations.

the finite resolution of IRIS and different noise levels. In addition, we
investigate the diagnostic potential of several other photospheric lines and

study the formation of the NUV slit-jaw images. We find that the instrumental
resolution of IRIS has a small effect on the quality of the h&k diagnostics;
the relations between the spectral features and atmospheric properties are
mostly unchanged. The peak separation is the most affected diagnostic, but
mainly due to limitations of the simulation. The effects of noise start to be
noticeable at a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 20, but we show that with noise
filtering one can obtain reliable diagnostics at least down to a S/N of 5. The
many photospheric lines present in the NUV window provide velocity information
for at least eight distinct photospheric heights. Using line-free regions in
the h&k far wings we derive good estimates of photospheric temperature for at
least three heights. Both of these diagnostics, in particular the latter, can
be obtained even at S/Ns as low as 5.

After the flare, the flux density started to decrease and reached values lower
than 10 Jy. We suggest that the 7 mm flare is the radio counterpart of the
$\gamma$-ray flare observed by Fermi/LAT in 2009 September, in which the flux
density at high energies reached a factor of fifty of its average value. A
delay of 170 days between the radio and $\gamma$-ray flares was revealed using
the Discrete Correlation Function (DCF) that can be interpreted in the context
of a shock model, in which each flare corresponds to the formation of a compact
superluminal component that expands and becomes optically thin at radio
frequencies at latter epochs. The difference in flare intensity between
frequencies and at a different times, is explained as a consequence of an
increase in the Doppler factor $\delta$, as predicted by the 16 year precession
model proposed by Abraham & Romero, which has a large effect on boosting at
high frequencies while does not affect too much the observed optically thick
radio emission. We discuss other observable effects of the variation in
$\delta$, as the increase in the formation rate of superluminal components, the
variations in the time delay between flares and the periodic behaviour of the
radio light curve that we found compatible with changes in the Doppler factor.

individual PPV structures. Our procedure projects density structures identified
in PPP space into corresponding intensity structures in PPV space and then
measures the geometric overlap of the projected structures with structures
identified from the synthetic observation. The fractional overlap between a PPP

information about the 3D structure. Applying this machinery to a set of
synthetic observations of CO isotopes, we measure how well spectral-line
measurements recover mass, size, velocity dispersion, and virial parameter for
a simulated star-forming region. By disabling various steps of our analysis, we
investigate how much opacity, chemistry, and gravity affect measurements of
physical properties extracted from PPV cubes. For the simulations used here,
our results suggest that superposition induces a ~40% uncertainty in masses,
sizes, and velocity dispersions derived from 13CO. The virial parameter is most
affected by superposition, such that estimates of the virial parameter derived
from PPV and PPP information typically disagree by a factor of ~2. This

quantum optimizer (AQO). When a quadratic optimization problem has at least one
set of discrete controls and the constraints are linear, we call this a
quadratic constrained mixed discrete optimization (QCMDO) problem. QCMDO
problems are NP-hard, and no efficient classical algorithm for their solution
is known. Included in the class of QCMDO problems are combinatorial
optimization problems constrained by a linear partial differential equation
(PDE) or system of linear PDEs. An essential complication commonly encountered
in solving this type of problem is that the linear constraint may introduce
many intermediate continuous variables into the optimization while the
computational cost grows exponentially with problem size. We resolve this
difficulty by developing a constructive mapping from QCMDO to quadratic
unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) such that the size of the QUBO problem
depends only on the number of discrete control variables. With a suitable
embedding, taking into account the physical constraints of the realizable
coupling graph, the resulting QUBO problem can be implemented on an existing
AQO. The mapping itself is efficient, scaling cubically with the number of
continuous variables in the general case and linearly in the PDE case if an
efficient preconditioner is available.

spacetime region along a divergence-free vector field $v^\alpha$, we introduce
the concept of a ""vector volume"" $\mathcal{V}_v$. This volume can be defined in
various equivalent ways. For example, it can be given as $\mathrm d \mathcal
V(\mu) / \mathrm d \mu$, where $v^\alpha \partial_\alpha = \mathrm d / \mathrm
d \mu$, and $\mu$ is a parameter distance along the integral curve of $v$.
Equivalently, it can be defined as $\int v^\alpha \mathrm d \Sigma_\alpha$,
where $\mathrm d \Sigma_\alpha$ is the directed surface element. We find that
this volume is especially useful for the description of black holes, but it can
be used in other contexts as well. Moreover, this volume has several properties
of interest. Among these is the fact that the vector volume is linear with
respect to the the choice of vector $v^\alpha$. As a result, for example, in
stationary axially symmetric spacetimes with timelike Killing vectors
$t^\alpha$ and axial symmetric Killing vectors $\phi^\alpha$, the vector volume
of an axially symmetric region with respect to the vector $t^\alpha + \Omega
\phi^\alpha$ is equal for any value of $\Omega$, a consequence of the
additional result that $\phi^\alpha$ does not contribute to $\mathcal{V}_v$.
Perhaps of most interest is the fact that in Kerr-Schild spacetimes the volume
element for the full spacetime is equal to that of the background spacetime. We
discuss different ways of using the vector volume to define volumes for black
holes. Finally, we relate our work to the recent wide-spread thermodynamically
motivated study of the ""volumes"" of black holes associated with non-zero values

generalized multiplex network and assume that only a fraction $q$ of the nodes

process to describe the spread of an epidemic on these partially overlapped

threshold on the fraction $q > 0$ of shared nodes in a system composed of two

the layer with the smaller isolated threshold. Although a system of two
completely isolated networks is nearly indistinguishable from a system of two
networks that share just a few nodes, we find that the presence of these few

lower propagating capacity to change discontinuously and to acquire the

pumps. We reveal the basic mechanism of a state of free energy-starvation (FES)
with bifurcation analyses showing that ion dynamics is for a large range of
pump rates bistable without contact to an ion bath. This is interpreted as a
threshold reduction of a new fundamental mechanism of 'ionic excitability' that
causes a long-lasting but transient FES as observed in pathological states. We
can in particular conclude that a coupling of extracellular ion concentrations
to a large glial-vascular bath can take a role as an inhibitory mechanism
crucial in ion homeostasis, while the Na$^+$/K$^+$ pumps alone are insufficient
to recover from FES. Our results provide the missing link between the HH
formalism and activator-inhibitor models that have been successfully used for
modeling migraine phenotypes, and therefore will allow us to validate the
hypothesis that migraine symptoms are explained by disturbed function in ion
channel subunits, Na$^+$/K$^+$ pumps, and other proteins that regulate ion
homeostasis.

propagation in computer networks and rumor (or misinformation) spread in
Twitter-like online social networks. Although viral spread on large graphs has
been intensively analyzed on classical models such as
Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered, there still exits a deficit of effective
methods in practice to contain epidemic spread once it passes a critical
threshold. Against this backdrop, we explore methods of containing viral spread
in large networks with the focus on sparse random networks. The viral
containment strategy is to partition a large network into small components and
then to ensure the sanity of all messages delivered across different
components. With such a defense mechanism in place, an epidemic spread starting
from any node is limited to only those nodes belonging to the same component as
the initial infection node. We establish both lower and upper bounds on the
costs of inspecting inter-component messages. We further propose
heuristic-based approaches to partition large input graphs into small
components. Finally, we study the performance of our proposed algorithms under
different network topologies and different edge weight models.

of the spectrum. We find that over 99 per cent of the variability can be
described by just three components, which are consistent with variations in the
normalisation of the powerlaw continuum (~97 per cent), the photon index (~2
per cent), and the normalisation of a relativistically blurred reflection
spectrum (~0.5 per cent). We also find a fourth significant component but this
is heavily diluted by noise, and we can attribute all the remaining spectral
variability to noise. All three components are found to be variable on
timescales from 20 ks down to 1 ks, which corresponds to a distance from the
central black hole of less than 70 gravitational radii. We compare these
results with those derived from spectral fitting, and find them to be in very
good agreement with our interpretation of the principal components. We conclude
that the observed relatively weak variability in the reflected component of the

matter index $w_{m}$. In our analysis these parameters are treated as
bifurcation parameters. We found sets of values of these parameters which lead
to generic evolutional scenarios. We show that in isotropic and homogeneous
models in the Brans-Dicke theory with a quadratic potential function the de
Sitter state appears naturally. Stability conditions of this state are fully
investigated. It is shown that these models can explain accelerated expansion
of the Universe without the assumption of the substantial form of dark matter
and dark energy. The Poincare construction of compactified phase space with a
circle at infinity is used to show that phase space trajectories in a physical
region can be equipped with a structure of a vector field on nontrivial
topological closed space. For $\omega_{\textrm{BD}}<-3/2$ we show new types of
early and late time evolution leading from the anti-de Sitter to the de Sitter
state through an asymmetric bounce. In the theory without a ghost we find
bouncing solutions and the coexistence of the bounces and the singularity.
Following the Peixoto theorem some conclusions about structural stability are
drawn.

to dipole moments of light leptons. In the simplified model, these processes
will depend upon the same coupling constants. The tight experimental bounds on
the dipole moments of light leptons will constrain the coupling constants.
Consequently, this bound will then limit the annihilations. We will produce
this dipole moment bounds on the annihilation. From this analysis, we report
that the bound on annihilation to the electrons is $4.0\times10^{-7}\pb$ (g-2)
+ $8.8\times 10^{-15}\pb$ (EDM) and the muons is $5.6\times 10^{-4}\pb$ (g-2) +
$180\pb$ (EDM), in the limit where the mediator is much heavier than dark

are perturbations of this state with arbitrarily small energy density at early
times that is exponentially blueshifted in the contracting phase of 'eternal'
de Sitter space, and becomes large enough to disturb the classical geometry
through the semiclassical Einstein eqs. at later times. In the closely
analogous case of a constant, uniform electric field, a time symmetric state
equivalent to the de Sitter invariant one is constructed, which is also not a
stable vacuum state under perturbations. The role of a quantum anomaly in the
growth of perturbations and symmetry breaking is emphasized in both cases. In
de Sitter space, the same results are obtained either directly from the
renormalized stress tensor of a massive scalar field, or for massless conformal
fields of any spin, more directly from the effective action and stress tensor
associated with the conformal trace anomaly. The anomaly stress tensor shows
that states invariant under the O(4) subgroup of the de Sitter group are also
unstable to perturbations of lower spatial symmetry, implying that both the
O(4,1) isometry group and its O(4) subgroup are broken by quantum fluctuations.
Consequences of this result for cosmology and the problem of vacuum energy are

equal-time correlation function of the forces acting on a single wall gives the
force variance, which we show to be finite and independent of the plate

correlation, on the other hand, decays with the inverse inter-plate distance

be negative over the whole range of plate separations, indicating that the two

time-dependent force correlations exhibit damped temporal oscillations for
small plate separations and a more irregular oscillatory behavior at large

""secondary Casimir effect"", because the mean fluctuation-induced force, which

which is inspired by modern ideas in multiple testing. Imagine we have
observations from the linear model y = X beta + z, then we suggest estimating
the regression coefficients by means of a new estimator called SLOPE, which is
the solution to minimize 0.5 ||y - Xb\|_2^2 + lambda_1 |b|_(1) + lambda_2
|b|_(2) + ... + lambda_p |b|_(p); here, lambda_1 >= \lambda_2 >= ... >=
\lambda_p >= 0 and |b|_(1) >= |b|_(2) >= ... >= |b|_(p) is the order statistic
of the magnitudes of b. The regularizer is a sorted L1 norm which penalizes the
regression coefficients according to their rank: the higher the rank, the
larger the penalty. This is similar to the famous BHq procedure [Benjamini and
Hochberg, 1995], which compares the value of a test statistic taken from a
family to a critical threshold that depends on its rank in the family. SLOPE is
a convex program and we demonstrate an efficient algorithm for computing the
solution. We prove that for orthogonal designs with p variables, taking
lambda_i = F^{-1}(1-q_i) (F is the cdf of the errors), q_i = iq/(2p), controls
the false discovery rate (FDR) for variable selection. When the design matrix
is nonorthogonal there are inherent limitations on the FDR level and the power
which can be obtained with model selection methods based on L1-like penalties.
However, whenever the columns of the design matrix are not strongly correlated,
we demonstrate empirically that it is possible to select the parameters
lambda_i as to obtain FDR control at a reasonable level as long as the number
of nonzero coefficients is not too large. At the same time, the procedure
exhibits increased power over the lasso, which treats all coefficients equally.
The paper illustrates further estimation properties of the new selection rule
through comprehensive simulation studies.

clear blue and red GC subpopulations. The radial surface densities of the GC

galaxy effective radii respectively. The total number of GCs and specific
frequency are determined for each GC system. The ellipticity of the red
subpopulation is in better agreement with the host galaxy properties than is
the blue subpopulation, supporting the traditional view that metal-rich GCs are
closely associated with the bulk of their host galaxies' field stars, while
metal-poor GCs reflect a distinct stellar halo. With the addition of another 37

explored before [P.X.Wang et al.,J. Appl. Phys. 91, 856 (2002]. In this paper,
we have further investigated its influence upon the electron high-harmonic

a promising way to measure the beam width of intense lasers in experiments. In

with great sensitivity relying on certain active processes. Individual hair
cell bundles of non-mammals such as frogs and turtles are known to show
spontaneous oscillation. However hair bundles in vivo must be quiet in the
absence of stimuli, otherwise, the signal is drowned in intrinsic noise. Thus,
a certain mechanism is needed to exist in order to suppress intrinsic noise.
Here, through a model study of elastically coupled hair bundles of bullfrog
sacculi, we show that a low stimulus threshold and a high signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) can be achieved through the amplitude death phenomenon (the cessation of
spontaneous oscillations by coupling). This phenomenon occurs only when the
coupled hair bundles have inhomogeneous distribution, which is likely to be the
case in biological systems. We show that the SNR has non-monotonic dependence
on the mass of the overlying membrane, and find out that the SNR has maximum
value in the region of the amplitude death. The low threshold of stimulus
through amplitude death may account for the experimentally observed high
sensitivity of frog sacculi in detecting vibration. The hair bundles' amplitude
death mechanism provides a smart engineering design for low-noise
amplification.

are consequences of the spin-charge separation in the strongly repulsive limit.

of extreme states of matter under conditions that are far from thermal
equilibrium. This in turn could enable different approaches to generating
energy from nuclear fusion. Relaxing the equilibrium requirement could widen
the range of isotopes used in fusion fuels permitting cleaner and less
hazardous reactions that do not produce high energy neutrons. Here we propose
and implement a means to drive fusion reactions between protons and boron-11
nuclei, by colliding a laser-accelerated proton beam with a laser-generated
boron plasma. We report proton-boron reaction rates that are orders of
magnitude higher than those reported previously. Beyond fusion, our approach
demonstrates a new means for exploring low-energy nuclear reactions such as
those that occur in astrophysical plasmas and related environments.

an effect that is an artifact of the approximation used.

of several distinct planetary populations in the observed mass-period diagram.
Two of the most surprising are, (1) the concentration of gas giants around 1AU
and (2) the accumulation of a large number of low-mass planets with tight
orbits, also known as super-Earths and hot Neptunes. We have recently shown
that protoplanetary disks have multiple planet traps that are characterized by
orbital radii in the disks and halt rapid type I planetary migration. By
coupling planet traps with the standard core accretion scenario, we showed that
one can account for the positions of planets in the mass-period diagram. In
this paper, we demonstrate quantitatively that most gas giants formed at planet
traps tend to end up around 1 AU with most of these being contributed by dead
zones and ice lines. In addition, we show that a large fraction of super-Earths
and hot Neptunes are formed as ""failed"" cores of gas giants - this population
being constituted by comparable contributions from dead zone and heat
transition traps. Our results are based on the evolution of forming planets in
an ensemble of disks where we vary only the lifetimes of disks as well as their
mass accretion rates onto the host star. We show that a statistical treatment
of the evolution of a large population of planetary cores initially caught in
planet traps accounts for the existence of three distinct exoplantary
populations - the hot Jupiters, the more massive planets at roughly orbital
radii around 1 AU orbital, and the short period SuperEarths and hot Neptunes.
There are very few evolutionary tracks that feed into the large orbital radii
characteristic of the imaged Jovian planet, which agrees with recent surveys.
Finally, we find that low-mass planets in tight orbits become the dominant
planetary population for low mass stars ($M_* \le 0.7 M_{\odot}$).

theoretical studies has been put forward to resolve this issue, e.g. by
including correlation effects. In the present paper we explore the directional
dependence of the photoelectron emission and the consequences for the inferred

we find that accounting for emission within a cone of 45 deg aperture, leads to
a substantially increase of the relative time delay.

units, in which multiple spatio-temporal patterns are stored as dynamical
attractors. We introduce an order parameter, which measures the overlap
(similarity) between the activity of the network and the stored patterns. We
find that, depending on the excitability of the network, different working
regimes are possible. For high excitability, the dynamical attractors are
stable, and a collective activity that replays one of the stored patterns
emerges spontaneously, while for low excitability, no replay is induced.
Between these two regimes, there is a critical region in which the dynamical
attractors are unstable, and intermittent short replays are induced by noise.
At the critical spiking threshold, the order parameter goes from zero to one,
and its fluctuations are maximized, as expected for a phase transition (and as
observed in recent experimental results in the brain). Notably, in this
critical region, the avalanche size and duration distributions follow power
laws. Critical exponents are consistent with a scaling relationship observed
recently in neural avalanches measurements. In conclusion, our simple model
suggests that avalanche power laws in cortical spontaneous activity may be the
effect of a network at the critical point between the replay and non-replay of
spatio-temporal patterns.

$Y$ is an edited version of ${X}$, where the editing involves random deletions,
insertions, and substitutions, possibly in bursts. The goal is for the node
with $Y$ to reconstruct $X$ with minimal exchange of information over a
noiseless link. The communication is measured in terms of both the total number
of bits exchanged and the number of interactive rounds of communication.
  This paper focuses on the setting where the number of edits is
$o(\tfrac{n}{\log n})$, where $n$ is the length of $X$. We first consider the
case where the edits are a mixture of insertions and deletions (indels), and
propose an interactive synchronization algorithm with near-optimal
communication rate and average computational complexity of $O(n)$ arithmetic
operations. The algorithm uses interaction to efficiently split the source
sequence into substrings containing exactly one deletion or insertion. Each of
these substrings is then synchronized using an optimal one-way synchronization
code based on the single-deletion correcting channel codes of Varshamov and
Tenengolts (VT codes).
  We then build on this synchronization algorithm in three different ways.
First, it is modified to work with a single round of interaction. The reduction
in the number of rounds comes at the expense of higher communication, which is
quantified. Next, we present an extension to the practically important case
where the insertions and deletions may occur in (potentially large) bursts.
Finally, we show how to synchronize the sources to within a target Hamming
distance. This feature can be used to differentiate between substitution and
indel edits. In addition to theoretical performance bounds, we provide several
validating simulation results for the proposed algorithms.

reduces the user scaling condition required to achieve any target DoF compared
to that for the single-inputmultiple-output IMAC. In this paper, we tackle two
practical challenges of the existing SVD-based OIA: 1) the need of full
feedforward of the selected users' beamforming weight vectors and 2) a low rate
achieved based on the exiting zero-forcing (ZF) receiver. We first propose a
codebook-based OIA, in which the weight vectors are chosen from a pre-defined
codebook with a finite size so that information of the weight vectors can be
sent to the belonging BS with limited feedforward. We derive the codebook size
required to achieve the same user scaling condition as the SVD-based OIA case
for both Grassmannian and random codebooks. Surprisingly, it is shown that the
derived codebook size is the same for the two considered codebook approaches.
Second, we take into account an enhanced receiver at the base stations (BSs) in
pursuit of improving the achievable rate based on the ZF receiver. Assuming no
collaboration between the BSs, the interfering links between a BS and the
selected users in neighboring cells are difficult to be acquired at the
belonging BS. We propose the use of a simple minimum Euclidean distance
receiver operating with no information of the interfering links. With the help
of the OIA, we show that this new receiver asymptotically achieves the channel
capacity as the number of users increases.

close to unity. We study in this work such processes for which the stability
condition is almost violated. Our main result states that after suitable

between the user rate and the mean square error, we then develop an iterative

solution is further derived in closed-form. Our analysis also shows that the
proposed algorithm can be implemented in parallel with reasonable complexity.
Numerical results illustrate that our algorithm has a fast convergence and
achieves near-optimal energy efficiency. It is also observed that at the low

the optimal energy efficiency simultaneously; while at the middle-high transmit

centers. Momentum-driven feedback from an accreting hole gives significant
orbital energy but little angular momentum to the surrounding gas. Once central
accretion drops, the feedback weakens and swept-up gas falls back towards the
SMBH on near-parabolic orbits. These intersect near the black hole with
partially opposed specific angular momenta, causing further infall and
ultimately the formation of a small-scale accretion disk. The feeding rates
into the disk typically exceed Eddington by factors of a few, growing the hole
on the Salpeter timescale and stimulating further feedback. Natural
consequences of this picture include (i) the formation and maintenance of a
roughly toroidal distribution of obscuring matter near the hole; (ii) random
orientations of successive accretion disk episodes; (iii) the possibility of
rapid SMBH growth; (iv) tidal disruption of stars and close binaries formed
from infalling gas, resulting in visible flares and ejection of hypervelocity
stars; (v) super-solar abundances of the matter accreting on to the SMBH; and

adiabatic SMBH growth implies. We also suggest a simple sub-grid recipe for

contributions to the magneto-electric coupling, using ab initio methods. The
electrostrictive and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya contributions were evaluated
individually. For this purpose a specific method was designed, combining DFT
calculations and embedded fragments, explicitely correlated, quantum chemical
calculations. This method allowed us to calculate the evolution of the magnetic
couplings as a function of an applied electric field. We found that in $\rm
YMnO_3$ the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya contribution to the magneto-electric effect
is three orders of magnitude weaker than the electrostrictive contribution.
Strictive effects are thus dominant in the magnetic exchange evolution under an
applied electric field, and by extension on the magneto-electric effect. These
effects remain however quite small and the modifications of the magnetic
excitations under an applied electric field will be difficult to observe
experimentally. Another important conclusion is that the amplitude of the
magneto-electric effect is very small. Indeed, it can be shown that the linear
magneto-electric tensor is null due to the inter-layer symmetry operations.

These
are beams with a Bessel-like profile that are capable of shifting laterally
along fairly arbitrary trajectories as the wave propagates in free space. The
concept expands on our previous proposal of paraxial accelerating Bessel-like
beams to include beams with subwavelength lobes and/or large trajectory angles.
Such waves are produced when the phase at the input plane is engineered so that
the interfering ray cones are made to focus along the prespecified path. When
the angle of these cones is fixed, the beams possess a diffraction-free Bessel
profile on planes that stay normal to their trajectory, which can be considered
as a generalized definition of diffractionless propagation in the nonparaxial
regime. The analytical procedure leading to these results is based on a ray
optics interpretation of Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction and is presented in
detail. The evolution of the proposed waves is demonstrated through a series of
numerical examples and a variety of trajectories.

excellent performance by exploiting label relations with shared space and
discovering sub-concepts for complicated labels. Experiments show that the

to be a tough problem. The basic scheme of Darwinian evolution produces
adaptations that only represent apparent (""as if"") goals and meaning. Here I
use evolutionary models to show that a slight, evolvable extension of the basic
scheme is sufficient to produce genuine goals. The extension, targeted
modulation of mutation rate, is known to be generally present in biological
cells, and gives rise to two phenomena that are absent from the non-living
world: intrinsic meaning and the ability to initiate goal-directed chains of
causation (active causation). The extended scheme accomplishes this by
utilizing randomness modulated by a feedback loop that is itself regulated by
evolutionary pressure. The mechanism can be extended to behavioural variability
as well, and thus shows how freedom of behaviour is possible. A further
extension to communication suggests that the active exchange of intrinsic
meaning between organisms may be the origin of consciousness, which in
combination with active causation can provide a physical basis for the
phenomenon of free will.

6.4 +/- 0.8M_earth. Both planets have low densities of 0.729 and 0.152 g cm^-3,
respectively, which is non-trivial for such cold and old (7-8 Gyr) planets.
Specifically, Kepler-87 c is the lowest- density planet in the super-Earth mass
range. Both planets are thus particularly amenable to modeling and planetary
structure studies, and also present an interesting case were ground-based
photometric follow-up of Kepler planets is very desirable. Finally, we also
detect two more short period super-Earth sized planetary (< 2R_earth)
candidates in the system, making the relatively high multiplicity of this
system notable against the general paucity of multiple systems in the presence
of giant planets like Kepler-87 b.

consumed and produced. When reaction networks contain molecules like ATP, they
are difficult to efficiently simulate, because every time such a molecule is
consumed or produced, the propensities of numerous reactions need to be
updated. In order to increase the speed of simulations, we developed 'Lazy
Updating', which postpones some propensity updates until some aspect of the
state of the system changes by more than a defined threshold. Lazy Updating
works with several existing stochastic simulation algorithms, including
Gillespie's direct method and the Next Reaction Method. We tested Lazy Updating
on two example models, and for the larger model it increased the speed of
simulations over eight-fold while maintaining a high level of accuracy. These
increases in speed will be larger for models with more widely connected hub
molecules. Thus Lazy Updating can contribute towards making models with a
limited computing time budget more realistic by including previously neglected
hub molecules.

stellar and sub-stellar objects (YSOs) in the Lupus star forming region,
spanning a range in mass from ~0.03 to ~1.2Msun, but mostly with 0.1Msun <
Mstar < 0.5Msun. Our aim is twofold: firstly, analyse the relationship between
excess-continuum and line emission accretion diagnostics, and, secondly, to
investigate the accretion properties in terms of the physical properties of the
central object. The accretion luminosity (Lacc), and from it the accretion rate
(Macc), is derived by modelling the excess emission, from the UV to the
near-IR, as the continuum emission of a slab of hydrogen. The flux and
luminosity (Ll) of a large number of emission lines of H, He, CaII, etc.,
observed simultaneously in the range from ~330nm to 2500nm, were computed. The
luminosity of all the lines is well correlated with Lacc. We provide empirical
relationships between Lacc and the luminosity of 39 emission lines, which have
a lower dispersion as compared to previous relationships in the literature. Our
measurements extend the Pab and Brg relationships to Lacc values about two
orders of magnitude lower than those reported in previous studies. We confirm
that different methodologies to measure Lacc and Macc yield significantly
different results: Ha line profile modelling may underestimate Macc by 0.6 to
0.8dex with respect to Macc derived from continuum-excess measures. Such
differences may explain the likely spurious bi-modal relationships between Macc
and other YSOs properties reported in the literature. We derive Macc in the
range 2e-12 -- 4e-8 Msun/yr and conclude that Macc is proportional to
Mstar^1.8(+/-0.2), with a dispersion lower by a factor of about 2 than in
previous studies. A number of properties indicate that the physical conditions
of the accreting gas are similar over more than 5 orders of magnitude in Macc.

that accounts for the non-coplanar-baseline effect, allows multiscale
reconstruction onto arbitrarily positioned pixel grids, and allows the antenna
elements to have direcitonal dependent gains. Using numerical L1-minimisation
techniques established in the application of compressive sensing to radio
astronomy, we directly solve the deconvolution equation using GPU (graphics
processing unit) hardware. This approach relies on an analytic expression for
the contribution of a pixel in the image to the observed visibilities, and the
well-known expression for Dirac delta function pixels is used along with two
new approximations for Gaussian pixels, which allow for multi-scale
deconvolution. The algorithm is similar to the CLEAN algorithm in that it fits
the reconstructed pixels in the image to the observed visibilities while
minimising the total flux; however, unlike CLEAN, it operates on the ungridded
visibilities, enforces positivity, and has guaranteed global convergence. The
pixels in the image can be arbitrarily distributed and arbitrary gains between
each pixel and each antenna element can also be specified. Direct deconvolution
of the observed visibilities is shown to be feasible for several deconvolution
problems, including a 1 megapixel wide-field image with over 400,000
visibilities. Correctness of the algorithm is shown using synthetic data, and
the algorithm shows good image reconstruction performance. Though this
algorithm requires significantly more computation than methods based on the
CLEAN algorithm, we demonstrate that it is trivially parallelisable across
multiple GPUs and potentially can be scaled to GPU clusters. We also
demonstrate that a significant speed up is possible through the use of
multi-scale analysis using Gaussian pixels.

pairs outside of the vortex core. The instability eventually develops into

embryos under the influence of a hot Jupiter (HJ) using gravitational N-body
simulations that include gravitational interactions between the gas disk and
the terrestrial planet (e.g., type I migration). Our simulations show that
several terrestrial planets efficiently form outside the orbit of the HJ,
making a chain of planets, and all of them gravitationally interact directly or
indirectly with the HJ through resonance, which leads to inward migration of
the HJ. We call this mechanism of induced migration of the HJ as ""crowding
out."" The HJ is eventually lost by collision with the central star, and only
several terrestrial planets remain. We also find that the efficiency of the
crowding-out effect depends on model parameters; for example, the heavier the
disk is, the more efficient the crowding out is. When planet formation occurs
in a massive disk, the HJ can be lost to the central star and is never
observed. On the other hand, for a less massive disk, the HJ and terrestrial
planets can coexist; however, the companion planets can be below the detection
limit of current observations. In both cases, systems with the HJ and
terrestrial planets have little chance for detection. Therefore, our model
naturally explains the lack of companion planets in HJ systems regardless of
the disk mass. In effect, our model provide a theoretical prediction for future
observations; additional planets can be discovered just outside the HJ, and
their masses should generally be small.

For this purpose, a proper objective function which is necessary for balancing

modeling of the mechanism. Then PSO, ABC, BGA and HGAPSO algorithms have been
applied for minimizing the defined cost function in optimization step. The
optimization results have been studied completely by extracting the cost

accurate for the Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (TASEP) with
random sequential update. However, a general implementation of DWT is still
missing in the case of updates with less fluctuations, which are often more
relevant for applications. Here we develop an exact DWT for TASEP with parallel
update and deterministic (p=1) bulk motion. Remarkably, the dynamics of this
system can be described by the motion of a domain wall not only on the
coarse-grained level but also exactly on the microscopic scale for arbitrary
system size. All properties of this TASEP, time-dependent and stationary, are
shown to follow from the solution of a bivariate master equation whose
variables are not only the position but also the velocity of the domain wall.
In the continuum limit this exactly soluble model then allows us to perform a
first principle derivation of a Fokker-Planck equation for the position of the
wall. The diffusion constant appearing in this equation differs from the one
obtained with the traditional `simple' DWT.

ranging from the suspension or precipitation of colloids to biomolecular
associations and protein folding. Here we revisit the origins of the effective
attractive interactions that emerge between and within macromolecules immersed
in solutions containing cosolutes that are preferentially excluded from the
macromolecular interfaces. Until recently, these depletion forces were
considered to be entropic in nature, resulting primarily from the tendency to
increase the space available to the cosolute. However, recent experimental
evidence indicates the existence of additional, energetically-dominated
mechanisms. In this review we follow the emerging characteristics of these
different mechanisms. By compiling a set of available thermodynamic data for
processes ranging from protein folding to protein-protein interactions, we show
that excluded cosolutes can act through two distinct mechanisms that correlate
to a large extent with their molecular properties. For many polymers at low to
moderate concentrations the steric interactions and molecular crowding effects
dominate, and the mechanism is entropic. To contrast, for many small excluded
solutes, such as naturally occurring osmolytes, the mechanism is dominated by
favorable enthalpy, whereas the entropic contribution is typically unfavorable.
We review the available models for these thermodynamic mechanisms, and comment
on the need for new models that would be able to explain the full range of
observed depletion forces.

species distribute and perform in response to environmental changes. Ecological
processes and structures are highly complex and adaptive. In order to quantify
emerging ecological patterns and investigate their hidden mechanisms, we need
to rely on the simplicity of mathematical language. This becomes especially
apparent when dealing with scaling patterns in ecology. Indeed, nearly all of
ecological patterns are scale dependent. Such scale dependence hampers our
predictive power and creates problems in our inference. This challenge calls
for a clear and fundamental understanding of how and why ecological patterns
change across scales. As Simon Levin stated in his MacArthur Award lecture, the
problem of relating phenomena across scales is the central problem in ecology
and other natural sciences. It has become clear that there is currently a drive
in ecology and complexity science to develop new quantitative approaches that
are suitable for analysing and forecasting patterns of ecological systems. Here
I provide a road map for future works on synthesizing the scaling patterns in
ecology, aiming (i) to collect and sort a diverse array of ecological patterns,
(ii) to present the dominant parametric forms of how these patterns change
across spatial and temporal scales, (iii) to detect the processes and
mechanisms using mathematical models, and finally (iv) to probe the physical
meaning of these scaling patterns. This road map is divided into three parts
and covers three main concepts of scale in ecology: heterogeneity, hierarchy
and size. Using scale as a thread, this road map and its following works weave
the kaleidoscope of ecological scaling patterns into a cohesive whole.

many applications including solvation and binding free energies, which are used
in computational drug discovery. However, there remain the challenges of
accuracy, simple implementation, robustness and efficiency, which prevent the
calculations from being automated and limit their use in computational drug
discovery. Here we present an exact and complete decoupling analysis in which
the partition functions of the compared systems decompose into the partition
functions of the common and different subsystems. This decoupling analysis is
applicable to submolecules with coupled degrees of freedom and to any potential
function, enabling to remove less terms in the transformation. Then we show
mathematically, in the context of partition function decoupling, that the two
compared systems can be simulated separately, eliminating the need to design a
composite system. We demonstrate the decoupling analysis and the separate
transformations in an MD calculation of relative free energy for a general
force field which is in agreement with experiments. We present a unified soft
core technique that will ensure the monotonicity of the numerically integrated
function. Finally, we show that when the systems have rugged energy landscape
they can be equilibrated without introducing another sampling dimension. The
concepts presented in the article have implications in accuracy, efficiency,

sequences in the analyzed set either do not have any offspring, or that parent
sequences can maximally mutate into just two descendants. The graph resulting
from such assumptions forms therefore a binary tree, with all the nodes labeled
as leaves. However, these constraints are unduly restrictive as there are
numerous data sets with multiple offspring of the same ancestors. Here we
propose a solution to analyze and visualize such sets in a more intuitive
manner. The method reconstructs phylogenetic tree by assigning the sequences
with offspring as internal nodes, and the sequences without offspring as leaf
nodes. In the resulting tree there is no constraint for the number of adjacent
nodes, which means that the solution tree needs not to be a binary graph only.
The subsequent derivation of evolutionary pathways, and pair-wise mutations,
are then an algorithmically straightforward, with edge's length corresponding
directly to the number of mutations. Other tree reconstruction algorithms can
be extended in the proposed manner, to also give unbiased topologies.

stochastic parameters. This includes both red spin noise and dispersion measure
variations using either power law descriptions of the noise, or through a
model-independent method that parameterises the power at individual frequencies
in the signal. We use TempoNest to show that at noise levels representative of
current datasets in the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) and International
Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) the linear timing model can underestimate the
uncertainties of the timing solution by up to an order of magnitude. We also
show how to perform Bayesian model selection between different sets of timing

considerably better performance. We address relevant open questions about
spatially coupled systems through the study of a simple Ising model. In
particular, we consider a chain of Curie-Weiss models that are coupled by
interactions up to a certain range. Indeed, it is well known that the pure
(uncoupled) Curie-Weiss model undergoes a first order phase transition driven
by the magnetic field, and furthermore, in the spinodal region such systems are
unable to reach equilibrium in sub-exponential time if initialized in the
metastable state. By contrast, the spatially coupled system is, instead, able
to reach the equilibrium even when initialized to the metastable state. The
equilibrium phase propagates along the chain in the form of a travelling wave.
Here we study the speed of the wave-front and the so-called `termination
cost'--- \textit{i.e.}, the conditions necessary for the propagation to occur.
We reach several interesting conclusions about optimization of the speed and
the cost.

experiment, motivated by the public databases of datasets in molecular biology
and other experimental sciences, and the need of scientists to relate to
earlier work on the level of actual measurement data. Since experiments are
inherently noisy and databases ever accumulating, we argue that a retrieval
engine should possess two particular characteristics. First, it should compare
models learnt from the experiments rather than the raw measurements themselves:
this allows incorporating experiment-specific prior knowledge to suppress noise
effects and focus on what is important. Second, it should be updated
sequentially from newly published experiments, without explicitly storing
either the measurements or the models, which is critical for saving storage
space and protecting data privacy: this promotes life long learning. We
formulate the retrieval as a ``supermodelling'' problem, of sequentially
learning a model of the set of posterior distributions, represented as sets of
MCMC samples, and suggest the use of Particle-Learning-based sequential
Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) for this purpose. The relevance measure for
retrieval is derived from the supermodel through the mixture representation. We
demonstrate the performance of the proposed retrieval method on simulated data

graph which guarantees to be a Ramanujan graph for each fixed number of
vertices. In almost of the cases, the bound coincides with the trivial bound,
which comes from the trivial estimate of the largest non-trivial eigenvalue of
the circulant graph. As exceptional cases, the bound in fact exceeds the
trivial one by two. We then prove that such exceptionals occur only in the
cases where the number of vertices has at most two prime factors and is
represented by a quadratic polynomial in a finite family and, moreover, under
the conjecture of Hardy-Littlewood and Bateman-Horn, exist infinitely many.

loss, modulation depth and saturation fluence of graphene-based saturable
absorbers (GSAs), by changing the thickness of a spacer between SLG and a
high-reflection mirror. This allows us to modulate the electric field intensity
enhancement at the GSA from 0 up to 400%, due to the interference of incident
and reflected light at the mirror. The unsaturated loss of the
SLG-mirror-assembly can be reduced to$\sim$0. We use this to mode-lock a VECSEL
from 935 to 981nm. This approach can be applied to integrate SLG into various
optical components, such as output coupler mirrors, dispersive mirrors,
dielectric coatings on gain materials. Conversely, it can also be used to
increase absorption (up to 10%) in various graphene based photonics and
optoelectronics devices, such as photodetectors.

optically active color center. Recently, it has been shown that this color
center is bright and can be detected at the single defect level. In addition,
the SiV defect shows a non-zero electronic spin ground state that potentially
makes this defect an alternative candidate for quantum optics and metrology
applications beside the well-known nitrogen-vacancy color center in diamond.
However, the electronic structure of the defect, the nature of optical
excitations and other related properties are not well-understood. Here we
present advanced \emph{ab initio} study on SiV defect in diamond. We determine
the formation energies, charge transition levels and the nature of excitations
of the defect. Our study unravel the origin of the dark or shelving state for
the negatively charged SiV defect associated with the 1.68-eV photoluminescence

theory of the cyclotomic Hecke algebras of type A with an emphasis on
understanding the KLR grading and the connections between the ""classical""
ungraded representation theory and the rapidly emerging graded theory. They are
fairly self-contained and they try to give a leisurely introduction to these
algebras, with many examples and calculations that don't appear elsewhere. We
make extensive use of the interactions between the ungraded and graded
representation theory and try to explain what the grading gives us that we
didn't have before. Combinatorics and cellular algebra techniques are used
throughout, with a few results from geometry and 2-representation theory being
quoted from the literature. Highlights include a complete description of the
semisimple KLR algebras of type A using just the KLR relations, extensive
discussion about graded Specht modules, a proof of the Ariki-Brundan-Kleshchev
graded categorification theorem based on the graded branching rules, a cellular
algebra approach to adjustment matrices and a (possibly optimistic) conjecture
for the graded dimensions of the simple modules.

decreases with the increasing of $\beta$ and the maximum height of the

non-minimal coupling constant. Here, the mid-field regime is
non-renormalisable, but we are able to give an upper bound on the 1-loop
corrections to the effective potential. We show that, in computing the
effective potential, the Jordan and Einstein frames are compatible if all mass
scales are transformed between the two frames. As such, it is consistent to
take a constant cutoff in either the Jordan or Einstein frame, and both
prescriptions yield the same result for the effective potential. Our results

their thermal and dynamical evolution and initiating the chemistry. Several
studies have shown that the formation of protostellar discs in collapsing
clouds is severely hampered by the braking torque exerted by the entrained
magnetic field on the infalling gas, as long as the field remains frozen to the
gas. We examine the possibility that the concentration and twisting of the
field lines in the inner region of collapse can produce a significant reduction
of the ionisation fraction. To check whether the CR ionisation rate (CRir) can
fall below the critical value required to maintain good coupling, we first
study the propagation of CRs in a model of a static magnetised cloud varying
the relative strength of the toroidal/poloidal components and the mass-to-flux
ratio. We then follow the path of CRs using realistic magnetic field
configurations generated by numerical simulations of a rotating collapsing
core. We find that an increment of the toroidal component of the magnetic
field, or, in general, a more twisted configuration of the field lines, results
in a decrease in the CR flux. This is mainly due to the magnetic mirroring
effect that is stronger where larger variations in the field direction are
present. In particular, we find a decrease of the CRir below 10^-18 s-1 in the
central 300-400 AU, where density is higher than about 10^9 cm-3. This very low
value of the CRir is attained in the cases of intermediate and low
magnetisation (mass-to-flux ratio lambda=5 and 17, respectively) and for
toroidal fields larger than about 40% of the total field. Magnetic field
effects can significantly reduce the ionisation fraction in collapsing clouds.
We provide a handy fitting formula to compute approximately the attenuation of
the CRir in a molecular cloud as a function of the density and the magnetic
configuration.

abundances extending almost twice as far to the southeast than in any other
direction. The abundance distribution is closely correlated with two
previously-identified cold fronts and an arc--shaped region of surface
brightness excess, and it appears that sloshing, induced by a previous tidal
encounter, has produced both the abundance and surface brightness features.
Sloshing dominates the uplift of heavy elements from the group core on large

content replication over Internet. This fact has certainly motivated proposals
to adapt these protocols to meet the requirements of on-demand streaming
system. The vast majority of these proposals focus on modifying the piece and
peer selection policies, respectively, of the original protocols. Nonetheless,
it is true that more attention has often been given to the piece selection
policy rather than to the peer selection policy. Within this context, this
article proposes a simple algorithm to be used as basis for peer selection
policies of BitTorrent-like protocols, considering interactive scenarios. To
this end, we analyze the client interactive behaviour when accessing real
multimedia systems. This analysis consists of looking into workloads of real
content providers and assessing three important metrics, namely temporal
dispersion, spatial dispersion and object position popularity. These metrics
are then used as the main guidelines for writing the algorithm. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first time that the client interactive behaviour is
specially considered to derive an algorithm for peer selection policies.
Finally, the conclusion of this article is drawn with key challenges and
possible future work in this research field.

the event of an epidemic to reduce the epidemic size. Unlike most social
distancing methods, ours do not require individuals to know the disease state

assumption that the structure of the entire contact network is known. Instead,
the recommended behavior change is based only on an individual's local view of
the network. Each individual avoids contact with a fraction of his/her
contacts, using knowledge of his/her local network to decide which contacts
should be avoided. If the behavior change occurs only when an individual

remains unclear. While it is usually agreed that single-degenerate progenitor
systems would be luminous supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs), it was recently
suggested that double-degenerate progenitors might also go through a SSS phase.
Aims: We aim to examine the possibility of double-degenerate progenitor systems
being SSSs, and place stringent upper limits on the maximally possible
durations of any SSS phases and expected number of these systems in a galactic
population. Method: We employ the binary population synthesis code SeBa to
examine the mass-transfer characteristics of a possible SSS phase of
double-degenerate type Ia SN progenitor systems for 1) the standard SeBa
assumptions, and 2) an optimistic best-case scenario. The latter case
establishes firm upper limits on the possible population of supersoft source
double-degenerate type Ia SN progenitor systems. Results: Our results indicate
that unlike what is expected for single-degenerate progenitor systems, the vast
majority of the material accreted by either pure wind mass transfer or a
combination of wind and RLOF mass transfer is helium rather than hydrogen. Even
with extremely optimistic assumptions concerning the mass-transfer and
retention efficiencies, the average mass accreted by systems that eventually
become double-degenerate type Ia SNe is small. Consequently, the lengths of
time that these systems may be SSSs are short, even under optimal conditions,
and the expected number of such systems in a galactic population is negligible.
Conclusions: The population of double-degenerate type Ia SN progenitors that
are SSSs is at least an order of magnitude smaller than the population of
single-degenerate progenitors expected to be SSSs, and the supersoft X-ray
behaviour of double-degenerate systems typically ceases long before the SN
explosions.

use the data to calculate the angular correlation function for galaxy samples
split by star-formation activity, stellar mass and redshift. We estimate the
real-space clustering for each sample, determining clustering lengths and
power-law slopes. For galaxies selected by constant mass, we find that the
clustering scale shows no evolution up to z ~ 2. Splitting the galaxy sample by
mass, we see that higher mass galaxies have larger clustering scales at all
redshifts. We use our results to test the GALFORM semi-analytical galaxy
formation model and find the two are consistent. We split the galaxy population
into passive and star-forming populations and find that the passive galaxy
population shows a significantly larger clustering scale at all redshifts than
the star-forming population below masses of ~$10^{11}M_\odot/h$, showing that
even at z ~ 2 passive galaxies exist in denser environments than the bulk of
the star-forming galaxy population. For star-forming galaxies with stellar
masses $>10^{11}M_\odot/h$, we find a clustering strength of ~8Mpc/h across all
redshifts, comparable to the measurements for the passive population. Also, for
star-forming galaxies we see that clustering strength increases for higher
stellar mass systems, however there is little sign of a mass dependence in
passive galaxies. Finally, we investigate the connection between galaxy stellar
mass and dark matter halo mass, showing a clear correlation between the two in
both the WIRDS data and the GALFORM predictions.

the generation of noise in the mass accretion rate of low mass X-ray binaries
on time-scales comparable to the orbital period of the system. We consider
modulations of mass captured by the compact object from the companion star's
stellar wind in binaries with late type giants, systems which usually have long
orbital periods. We show that a hydrodynamical interaction of the wind matter
within a binary system even without eccentricity results in variability of the
mass accretion rate with characteristic time-scales close to the orbital
period. The cause of the variability is an undeveloped turbulent motion
(perturbed motion without significant vorticity) of wind matter near the
compact object. Our conclusions are supported by 3D simulations with two
different hydrodynamic codes based on Lagrangian and Eulerian approaches -- the
SPH code GADGET and the Eulerian code PLUTO. In this work we assume that the
wind mass loss rate of the secondary is at the level of $(0.5-1)\times10^{-7}
M_\odot$/year, required to produce observable variations of the mass accretion
rate on the primary. This value is higher than that, estimated for single giant
stars of this type, but examples of even higher mass loss rate of late type
giants in binaries do exist. Our simulations show that the stellar wind matter
intercepted by the compact object might create observational appearances
similar to that of an accretion disc corona/wind and could be detected via high
energy resolution observations of X-ray absorption lines, in particular, highly
ionized ions of heavy elements.

host stars may be a consequence of large-scale radial migration through the
proto-planetary nebulae. Within the context of this picture, significant
orbital obliquities characteristic of a substantial fraction of such planets
can be attributed to external torques that perturb the disks out of alignment
with the spin axes of their host stars. Therefore, the acquisition of orbital
obliquity exhibits sensitive dependence on the physics of disk-star
interactions. Here, we analyze the primordial excitation of spin-orbit
misalignment of Sun-like stars, in light of disk-star angular momentum
transfer. We begin by calculating the stellar pre-main sequence rotational
evolution, accounting for spin-up due to gravitational contraction and
accretion as well as spin-down due to magnetic star-disk coupling. We devote
particular attention to angular momentum transfer by accretion, and show that
while generally subdominant to gravitational contraction, this process is
largely controlled by the morphology of the stellar magnetic field (i.e.
specific angular momentum accreted by stars with octupole-dominated surface
fields is smaller than that accreted by dipole-dominated stars by an order of
magnitude). Subsequently, we examine the secular spin-axis dynamics of
disk-bearing stars, accounting for the time-evolution of stellar and disk
properties and demonstrate that misalignments are preferentially excited in
systems where stellar rotation is not overwhelmingly rapid. Moreover, we show
that the excitation of spin-orbit misalignment occurs impulsively, through an
encounter with a resonance between the stellar precession frequency and the
disk-torquing frequency. Cumulatively, the model developed herein opens up a
previously unexplored avenue towards understanding star-disk evolution and its
consequences in a unified manner.

radiation persists for T< T*. T* turns out to be below the standard
Hawking-Page temperature and there are no unstable black holes as in the usual

rates exceeding one bit per photon are achieved by employing high-dimensional

correlations are shown to be insensitive to axial rotation of the target
object: the information structure of an object's joint OAM coincidence spectrum
is unchanged even when the object undergoes random rotations between each
measurement. Additionally, OAM correlations alone are shown to be sufficient
for full image reconstruction of complex, off-axis objects, and novel object
symmetries are observed in the phases of OAM-object interaction transition
amplitudes. Variations in mutual information rates, due to off-axis translation
in the beam field, are studied, and it is shown that object symmetry signatures
and information rates are independent of environmental factors sufficiently far
from the beam center. The results motivate dynamic scanning applications in
contexts where symmetry and small numbers of noninvasive measurements are

central role in the generation of atrial reentry leading to atrial
fibrillation, but its mechanism has not been analytically explained. In order
to improve the current clinical procedures for atrial reentry by understanding
its mechanism, geometrical analysis is proposed on the conditions of conduction
failure at the PVs and is validated by various computational modeling. To
achieve this, a new analytic approach is proposed by adapting the geometric
relative acceleration analysis from spacetime physics on the hypothesis that a
large relative acceleration can translate to a dramatic increase in the
curvature of the wavefront and subsequently to conduction failure. This
analytic method is applied to a simplified model of the PV to reveal the strong
dependency of the propagational direction and the magnitude of anisotropy for
conduction failure. The unidirectionality of the PVs follows directly and is
validated by computational tests in a T-shaped domain, computational
simulations for three-dimensional atrial reentry and previous in-silico reports
for atrial reentry.

$^{10}$C are generated in irradiated tissues by nuclear reactions. Immediately
after patient irradiation, PET scanners can be used to measure the spatial
distribution of positron emitters, which can track the carbon beam to the
tissue. In this study, we designed and evaluated an dual-plate in-room PET
scanner to monitor patient dose in carbon ion therapy, which is based on GATE
simulation platform. A dual-plate PET is designed to avoid interference with
the carbon beam line and with patient positioning. Its performance was compared
with that of four-head and full-ring PET scanners. The dual-plate, four-head
and full-ring PET scanners consisted of 30, 60, 60 detector modules,
respectively, with a 36 cm distance between directly opposite detector modules
for dose deposition measurements. Each detector module was consisted of a
24$\times$24 array of 2$\times2\times$18 mm$^{3}$ LYSO pixels coupled to a
Hamamatsu H8500 PMT. To esitmate the production yield of positron emitters, a
10$\times15\times$15 cm$^{3}$ cuboid PMMA phantom was irradiated with 172, 200,
250 AMeV $^{12}$C beams. 3D images of the activity distribution of the three

comparing the longitudinal profile of positron emitters, measured along the

base station (BS) equipped with many antennas serves several single-antenna
users in the same time-frequency resource. We assume that the BS uses linear
precoding for the transmission. To reliably decode the signals transmitted from
the BS, each user should have an estimate of its channel. In this work, we
consider an efficient channel estimation scheme to acquire CSI at each user,
called beamforming training scheme. With the beamforming training scheme, the
BS precodes the pilot sequences and forwards to all users. Then, based on the
received pilots, each user uses minimum mean-square error channel estimation to
estimate the effective channel gains. The channel estimation overhead of this
scheme does not depend on the number of BS antennas, and is only proportional
to the number of users. We then derive a lower bound on the capacity for
maximum-ratio transmission and zero-forcing precoding techniques which enables
us to evaluate the spectral efficiency taking into account the spectral
efficiency loss associated with the transmission of the downlink pilots.
Comparing with previous work where each user uses only the statistical channel
properties to decode the transmitted signals, we see that the proposed

It takes advantage of the special electronic structure expected for group 2
halides and group 2 hydrides: The electronic ground state of neutral RaF and
its monocation differ in occupation of a non-bonding orbital of $\sigma$
symmetry. This implies similar equilibrium distances and harmonic vibrational
wavenumbers in the two charge states and thus favourable Franck--Condon factors
for neutralisation without dissociation in neutralising collisions. According
to the calculated ionisation energy of RaF, charge exchange collisions of
RaF$^+$ with sodium atoms are almost iso-enthalpic, resulting in large
cross-sections for the production of neutral radium monofluoride.

require as input the metric perturbation in a sufficiently regular gauge. A
basic challenge in the program to compute the GSF for orbits around a Kerr
black hole is that the standard procedure for reconstructing the perturbation
is formulated in a class of radiation gauges, in which the particle singularity
is non-isotropic and extends away from the particle's location. Here we present
two practical schemes for calculating the GSF using a radiation-gauge
reconstructed metric as input. The schemes are based on a detailed analysis of
the local structure of the particle singularity in the radiation gauges. We
identify 3 types of radiation gauges: two containing a radial string-like
singularity emanating from the particle, either in one direction (""half-string""
gauges) or both directions (""full-string"" gauges); and a third type containing
no strings but with a jump discontinuity across a surface intersecting the
particle. Based on a flat-space example, we argue that the standard
mode-by-mode reconstruction procedure yields the ""regular half"" of a
half-string solution, or (equivalently) either of the regular halves of a
no-string solution. For the half-string case, we formulate the GSF in a locally
deformed radiation gauge that removes the string singularity near the particle.
We derive a mode-sum formula for the GSF in this gauge, analogous to the
standard Lorenz-gauge formula but with modified regularization parameters. For
the no-string case, we formulate the GSF directly, without a local deformation,
and we derive a mode-sum formula that requires no correction to the parameters
but involves a certain averaging procedure. We explain the consistency of our
results with Gralla's invariance theorem, and discuss the correspondence
between our method and a related approach by Friedman et al.

quantifies its predictive capacity. Thus, the accuracy of error estimation is
critical. Error estimation is problematic in small-sample classifier design
because the error must be estimated using the same data from which the
classifier has been designed. Use of prior knowledge, in the form of a prior
distribution on an uncertainty class of feature-label distributions to which
the true, but unknown, feature-distribution belongs, can facilitate accurate
error estimation (in the mean-square sense) in circumstances where accurate
completely model-free error estimation is impossible. This paper provides
analytic asymptotically exact finite-sample approximations for various
performance metrics of the resulting Bayesian Minimum Mean-Square-Error (MMSE)
error estimator in the case of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) in the
multivariate Gaussian model. These performance metrics include the first,
second, and cross moments of the Bayesian MMSE error estimator with the true
error of LDA, and therefore, the Root-Mean-Square (RMS) error of the estimator.
We lay down the theoretical groundwork for Kolmogorov double-asymptotics in a
Bayesian setting, which enables us to derive asymptotic expressions of the
desired performance metrics. From these we produce analytic finite-sample
approximations and demonstrate their accuracy via numerical examples. Various
examples illustrate the behavior of these approximations and their use in
determining the necessary sample size to achieve a desired RMS. The

coalesce or react with each other. To determine the collision rate, many
numerical studies rely on the 'Ghost Collision Approximation' (GCA), which
simply records how often pairs of point particles come within a threshold
distance. In many applications, the suspended particles stick (or in the case
of liquid droplets, coalesce) upon collision, and it is the frequency of first
contact which is of interest. If a pair of 'ghost' particles undergoes multiple
collisions, the GCA may overestimate the true collision rate. Here, using fully
resolved Direct Numerical Simulations of turbulent flows at moderate Reynolds
number (R_\lambda = 130), we investigate the prevalence and properties of
multiple collisions. We demonstrate that the GCA leads to a systematic
overestimate of the collision rate, which is of the order of 15% when the
particle inertia is small, and slowly decreases when inertia increases. We
investigate the probability P(N) for a given pair of ghost particles colliding
N times. We find P(N)=\beta \alpha^N for N_>1, where \alpha and \beta are
coefficients which depend upon the particle inertia. This result is used to
explain the discrepancy between the GCA and the true collision rates. We also
investigate the statistics of the times that ghost particles remain in contact.
We show that the probability density function of the contact time is different
for the first collision. The difference is explained by the effect of caustics
in the phase space of the suspended particles.

the infinite-time density matrix and its dependence on initial conditions. The
effect of the environment in the infinite time limit can therefore be tracked
exactly for arbitrary state initialization and without knowledge of dynamics at
intermediate time. As a consequence, sufficient criteria for determining the
steady state of a Lindblad master equation are obtained. These criteria are
knowledge of the initial state, a basis for the steady-state subspace, and all
conserved quantities. We give examples of two-qubit dissipation and single-mode
$d$-photon absorption where all quantities are determined analytically.

presented mostly arose from a layer-by-layer analysis of the facets of the

postulates which are thus identified as classical precursors of two of the
facets of the Problem of Time. These are furthemore tied to the forms of each
of the GR Hamiltonian and momentum constraints. Other aspects of Background
Independence include the algebraic closure of these constraints, expressing
physics in terms of beables, foliation independence as implemented by
refoliation invariance, the reconstruction of spacetime from space. The final
picture is that Background Independence - a philosophically desirable and
physically implementable feature for a theory to have - has the facets of the
Problem of Time among its consequences. Thus these arise naturally and are
problems to be resolved, as opposed to avoided `by making one's physics
background-dependent in order not to have these problems'. This serves as a

network dynamics demonstrate that several scaling-laws in social networks
follow as natural consequences of triadic closure. Macroscopic comparisons
between them are discussed empirically in many works. However the network
evolution drives not only the emergence of macroscopic scaling but also the
microscopic behaviors. Here we exploit two fundamental aspects of the network
microscopic evolution: the individual influence evolution and the process of
link formation. First we develop a novel framework for the microscopic
evolution, where the mechanisms of preferential attachment and triadic closure
are well balanced. Then on four real-world datasets we apply our approach for
two microscopic problems: node's prominence prediction and link prediction,
where our method yields significant predictive improvement over baseline
solutions. Finally to be rigorous and comprehensive, we further observe that
our framework has a stronger generalization capacity across different kinds of
social networks for two microscopic prediction problems. We unveil the
significant factors with a greater degree of precision than has heretofore been

Bayesian methods in statistics and machine learning, combined with their

identification of potential opportunities to parallelize techniques such as
MCMC sampling, and the development of general strategies for mapping such
parallel algorithms to modern CPUs in order to elicit the performance up the
compute-based and/or memory-based hardware limits. Two opportunities for
Single-Instruction Multiple-Data (SIMD) parallelization of MCMC sampling for
probabilistic graphical models are presented. In exchangeable models with many
observations such as Bayesian Generalized Linear Models, child-node
contributions to the conditional posterior of each node can be calculated
concurrently. In undirected graphs with discrete nodes, concurrent sampling of
conditionally-independent nodes can be transformed into a SIMD form.
High-performance libraries with multi-threading and vectorization capabilities
can be readily applied to such SIMD opportunities to gain decent speedup, while
a series of high-level source-code and runtime modifications provide further
performance boost by reducing parallelization overhead and increasing data
locality for NUMA architectures. For big-data Bayesian GLM graphs, the
end-result is a routine for evaluating the conditional posterior and its
gradient vector that is 5 times faster than a naive implementation using
(built-in) multi-threaded Intel MKL BLAS, and reaches within the striking
distance of the memory-bandwidth-induced hardware limit. The proposed

long physical domain with a relatively thin cross-section. In this scenario we
typically expect the system to have structures that vary slowly in the long

self-consistency or limit arguments as the aspect ratio becomes unphysically

supports the local modelling of the system's dynamics with coupling to
neighbouring locales treated as a non-autonomous forcing. The union over all
cross-sections then provides powerful new support for the existence and
emergence of a centre manifold model global in the long domain, albeit finite
sized. Our resolution of the coupling between neighbouring locales leads to
novel quantitative estimates of the error induced by long slow space
variations. Four examples help develop and illustrate the approach and results.
The approach developed here may be used to quantify the accuracy of known

open previously intractable modelling issues to new tools and insights.

filaments pressing on a surface, akin to the case of an actin bundle in

simulations of a grafted bundle of parallel living (self-assembling) filaments,
in chemical equilibrium with a solution of their constitutive monomers.
Equilibrium is established as these filaments, grafted at one end to a wall of
the simulation box, grow at their chemically active free end and encounter the
opposite confining wall of the simulation box. Further growth of filaments
requires bending and thus energy, which automatically limit the populations of
longer filaments. The resulting filament sizes distribution and the force
exerted by the bundle on the obstacle are analyzed for different grafting
densities and different sub- or supercritical conditions, these properties
being compared with the predictions of the corresponding ideal confined bundle
model. In this analysis, non-ideal effects due to interactions between
filaments and confinement effects are singled out. For all state points
considered at the same temperature and at the same gap width between the two
surfaces, the force per filament exerted on the opposite wall appears to be a
function of a rescaled free monomer density $\hat{\rho}_1^{\rm eff}$. This
quantity can be estimated directly from the characteristic length of the
exponential filament size distribution $P$ observed in the size domain where
these grafted filaments are not in direct contact with the wall. We also
analyze the dynamics of the filament contour length fluctuations in terms of
effective polymerization ($U$) and depolymerization ($W$) rates, where again it
is possible to disentangle non-ideal and confinement effects.

effective metadata information incorporation method is employed on the prior
information from relational models MMSB and LFRM. This is to encourage the

Ad-hoc networks are considered particularly important. Most of the previous
research in Ad-hoc networks concentrated on the development and enhancement of
dynamic routing protocols, which could efficiently discover routes between two
communicating nodes. Although routing strategies is an important topic in
MANETs, other topics such as data access are also crucial since the final goal
of using Ad-hoc networks is to provide data access to mobile nodes. One of the
most attractive techniques used to improve the data access performance in MANET
environment is cooperative caching; which means multiple caching nodes share
and cooperatively manage the cached contents. It is lead the research to
important questions, what data should be cached, where, when, and how? A
cooperative caching addressed into two basic issues: cache discovery and cache
management, in other words, how to find requested data efficiently and how to
manage an individual cache to improve the overall capacity of a cooperated
cache. In this paper we have made a review of the existing cache discovery
algorithms to address four stages after application request and before server
response, using an historical file to record the previous data requests, and
proposed cluster architecture with data cluster head election to store
efficient information for future use and reducing the cost of flooding. In
addition, this paper suggests some alternative techniques for cache discovery.
Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion on future research directions.

emission at wavelengths ranging from millimeter-wave to the far-infrared.
PRISM's main objective is to explore the distant universe, probing cosmic
history from very early times until now as well as the structures, distribution
of matter, and velocity flows throughout our Hubble volume. PRISM will survey
the full sky in a large number of frequency bands in both intensity and

distributions (SED) of all galaxies which were based on the SDSS spectra in the
visible range of 0.38-0.92 micron and included both the stellar and ionised gas
emission. These SEDs were extrapolated to the UV and mid-infrared ranges to
cover the wavelength range of 0.1-22 micron. The SDSS spectroscopic data were
supplemented by photometric data from the GALEX, SDSS, 2MASS, WISE, IRAS, and
NVSS all-sky surveys. We derived global characteristics of the galaxies, such
as their element abundances, luminosities, and stellar masses. The luminosities
and stellar masses range within the sample over ~5 orders of magnitude, thereby
linking low-mass and low-luminosity blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies to
luminous galaxies, which are similar to high-redshift Lyman-break galaxies
(LBGs). The luminosity L(Hbeta) of the Hbeta emission line, a characteristic of
the youngest stellar population with an age of a few Myr, is correlated with
luminosities in other wavelength ranges. This implies that the most recent
burst of star formation makes a significant contribution to the emission in the
visible range and dominates in other wavelength ranges. We found 20 galaxies
with very red WISE mid-infrared m(3.4micron)-m(4.6micron) colour (>2 mag),
which suggests the important contribution of the hot (with a temperature of
several hundred degree) dust emission in these galaxies. Our analysis of the
balance between the luminosity in the WISE bands that covered a wavelength
range of 3.4-22 micron and the luminosity of the emission absorbed at shorter
wavelengths showed that the luminosity of the hot dust emission is increased
with increasing L(Hbeta) and EW(Hbeta).

multi-gigabit communication systems operating in bandwidth of several GHz. In
this paper, we study the use of transmitter (Tx) beamforming techniques to
improve the performance of a MIMO system with a low precision ADC. We motivate
an approach to use eigenmode transmit beamforming (which imposes a diagonal
structure in the complete MIMO system) and use an eigenmode power allocation
which minimizes the uncoded BER of the finite precision system. Although we
cannot guarantee optimality of this approach, we observe that even low with
precision ADC, it performs comparably to full precision system with no
eigenmode power allocation. For example, in a high throughput MIMO system with
a finite precision ADC at the receiver, simulation results show that for a 3/4
LDPC coded 2x2 MIMO OFDM 16-QAM system with 3-bit precision ADC at the
receiver, a BER of 0.0001 is achieved at an SNR of 26 dB. This is 1 dB better
than that required for the same system with full precision but equal eigenmode

their very nature are concerned with producing viscometric or

occurs in the flow of viscoelastic fluids with curved streamlines. To calibrate
the rheometer we combine simple scaling arguments with relaxation times
obtained from first normal-stress difference data measured in a classical shear
rheometer. As an additional check we also compare these relaxation times to
those obtained from Zimm theory and good agreement is observed. Once
calibrated, we show how the serpentine rheometer can be used to access smaller
polymer concentrations and lower solvent viscosities where classical
measurements become difficult or impossible to use due to inertial and/or

can still be a very useful comparative or index device.

interpret the measures as typicality measures. In measure-theoretic dynamical
systems theory measures can similarly be interpreted as typicality measures.
However, a justification why these measures are a good choice of typicality
measures is missing, and the paper attempts to fill this gap. The paper first
argues that Pitowsky's (2012) justification of typicality measures does not fit
the bill. Then a first proposal of how to justify typicality measures is
presented. The main premises are that typicality measures are invariant and are
related to the initial probability distribution of interest (which are
translation-continuous or translation-close). The conclusion are two theorems
which show that the standard measures of statistical mechanics and dynamical
systems are typicality measures. There may be other typicality measures, but
they agree about judgements of typicality. Finally, it is proven that if
systems are ergodic or epsilon-ergodic, there are uniqueness results about
typicality measures.

integers Z, where the graph P_{n,d} is the discrete segment {0,1,..., n} with
edges between vertices of different parity whose distance is at most 2d+1. Such

exactly one along edges of the graph P_{n,d}. We also consider a similarly

transition from a delocalized to a localized phase when d grows beyond a

radiation pressure. As this mechanism is size-dependent, we expect dust grains
to be spatially segregated according to their sizes. However, because of the
complex interplay between radiation pressure, collisions and dynamical
perturbations, this spatial segregation of the particle size distribution (PSD)
has proven difficult to investigate with numerical models. We propose to
explore this issue using a new-generation code that can handle some of the
coupling between dynamical and collisional effects. We investigate how PSDs
behave in both unperturbed discs ""at rest"" and in discs pertubed by planetary
objects. We use the DyCoSS code of Thebault(2012) to investigate the coupled
effect of collisions, radiation pressure and dynamical perturbations in systems
having reached a steady state. We consider 2 setups: a narrow ring perturbed by
an exterior planet, and an extended disc into which a planet is embedded. For
both setups we consider an additional unperturbed case with no planet. We also
investigate how possible spatial size segregation affect disc images at
different wavelengths. We find that PSDs are always strongly spatially
segregated. The only case for which they follow a standard dn/dr = C.r**(-3.5)
law is for an unperturbed narrow ring, but only within the parent body ring
itself. For all other configurations, the PSD can strongly depart from such
power laws and have strong spatial gradients. As an example, the geometrical
cross section of the disc is rarely dominated by the smallest grains on bound
orbits, as it is expected to be in standard PSDs in s**q with q<-3. Although
the exact profiles and spatial variations of PSDs are a complex function of the
considered set-up, we are however able to derive some robust results that
should be useful for image-or-SED-fitting models of observed discs.

Propagation of the longitudinal and acoustic modes is found to be strictly

delivered to a hand holding a joystick can serve as a platform for a brain
computer interface (BCI). The four pressure directions are used to evoke
tactile brain potential responses, thus defining a tactile-force brain computer
interface (tfBCI). We present brain signal processing and classification
procedures leading to successful interfacing results. Experimental results with
seven subjects performing online BCI experiments provide a validation of the
hand location tfBCI paradigm, while the feasibility of the concept is
illuminated through remarkable information-transfer rates.

since 23 April 2007 and continues to operate reliably. The gamma-ray detector,
AGILE-GRID, has observed Galactic and extragalactic sources, many of which were
collected in the first AGILE Catalog. Aims: We present the calibration of the
AGILE-GRID using in-flight data and Monte Carlo simulations, producing
Instrument Response Functions (IRFs) for the effective area A_eff), Energy
Dispersion Probability (EDP), and Point Spread Function (PSF), each as a
function of incident direction in instrument coordinates and energy. Methods:
We performed Monte Carlo simulations at different gamma-ray energies and
incident angles, including background rejection filters and Kalman filter-based
gamma-ray reconstruction. Long integrations of in-flight observations of the
Vela, Crab and Geminga sources in broad and narrow energy bands were used to
validate and improve the accuracy of the instrument response functions.
Results: The weighted average PSFs as a function of spectra correspond well to
the data for all sources and energy bands. Conclusions: Changes in the
interpolation of the PSF from Monte Carlo data and in the procedure for
construction of the energy-weighted effective areas have improved the
correspondence between predicted and observed fluxes and spectra of celestial
calibration sources, reducing false positives and obviating the need for
post-hoc energy-dependent scaling factors. The new IRFs have been publicly
available from the Agile Science Data Centre since November 25, 2011, while the
changes in the analysis software will be distributed in an upcoming release.

functionals of Poisson random measures, where the quality is measured by the
Kolmogorov distance. Combining Stein's method with the Malliavin calculus of
variations on the Poisson space, we derive a bound, which is strictly smaller
than what is available in the literature. This is applied to sequences of
multiple integrals and sequences of Poisson functionals having a finite chaotic
expansion. This leads to new Berry-Esseen bounds in de Jong's theorem for
degenerate U-statistics. Moreover, geometric functionals of intersection
processes of Poisson $k$-flats, random graph statistics of the Boolean model
and non-linear functionals of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck-L\'evy processes are
considered.

$k$. Assume $A$ is a basic connected and triangular algebra with $n$ pairwise
non-isomorphic simple modules. We consider the {\em Coxeter transformation}
$\phi_A(T)$ as the automorphism of the Grothendieck group $K_0(A)$ induced by
the Auslander-Reiten translation $\tau$ in the derived category
$\Der^b(\mod_A)$ of the module category $\mod_A$ of finite dimensional left
$A$-modules. We say that $A$ is of {\em cyclotomic type} if the characteristic
polynomial $\chi_A$ of $\phi_A$ is a product of cyclotomic polynomials,
equivalently, if the {\em Mahler measure} $M(\chi_A)=1$. In \cite{Pe} we have
considered the many examples of algebras of cyclotomic type in the
representation theory literature. In this paper we study the Mahler measure of
the Coxeter polynomial of {\em accessible algebras}. In 1933, D. H. Lehmer
found that the polynomial $T^{10} + T^9 - T^7 - T^6 - T^5 - T^4 - T^3 + T + 1$
has Mahler measure $\mu_0 = 1.176280 . . .$, and he asked if there exist any
smaller values exceeding 1. In this paper we prove that for any accessible
algebra $A$ either $M(\chi_A)=1$ or $M(\chi_B) \ge \mu_0$ for some convex
subcategory $B$ of $A$. We introduce {\em interlaced tower of algebras}
$A_m,\ldots,A_n$ with $m \le n-2$ satisfying $$\chi_{A_{s+1}} =(T+1) \chi_{A_s}
- T \chi_{A_{s-1}}$$ for $m+1 \le s \le n-1$. We prove that, if ${\rm Spec
\,}\phi_{A_n} \subset \s^1 \cup \R^+$ and $A_n$ is not of cyclotomic type then
$M(\chi_{A_m}) <M(\chi_{A_n})$.

High Energy Phys., Vol. 2013 (2013) 873686,","10.1155/2013/873686",,"hep-th gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce the new 5D braneworld with the real scalar field in the bulk.
The model represents the brane which bounds collective oscillations of
gravitational and scalar field standing waves. These waves are out of phase,
i.e. the energy of oscillations passes back and forth between the scalar and
gravitational waves. When the amplitude of the standing waves is small the
brane width and the size of the horizon in extra space are of a same order of
magnitude, and matter fields are localized in extra dimension due to the
presence of the horizon. When oscillations are large trapping of matter fields
on the brane is provided mainly by the pressure of bulk waves. It is shown that
in this case the mass of the lightest KK mode is determined by the smaller
energy scale corresponding to the horizon size, i.e. these modes can be created
in accelerators at relatively low energies, which gives a chance to check the
present model.

the Hubble parameter in terms of some unknown parameters and observational
parameters with the redshift z. From observed Hubble data (OHD) set (12
points), we have obtained the bounds of the arbitrary parameters (A,B) of MCG
by minimizing the \chi^{2} test. Next due to joint analysis of BAO and CMB
observations, we have also obtained the best fit values and the bounds of the
parameters (A,B) by fixing some other parameters. We have also taken type Ia
supernovae data set (union 2 data set with 557 data points). Next due to joint
analysis with SNe, we have obtained the best fit values of parameters. The
best-fit values and bounds of the parameters are obtained by 66%, 90% and 99%
confidence levels for OHD, OHD+BAO, OHD+BAO+CMB and OHD+BAO+CMB+SNe joint

MCG model in Einstein-Aether gravity have been tested for the best fit values
of the parameters and the observed SNe Ia union2 data sample.

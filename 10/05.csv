  Automated Reasoning and Cognitive Models",,,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A number of well-known theorems, such as Cox's theorem and de Finetti's
theorem. prove that any model of reasoning with uncertain information that
satisfies specified conditions of ""rationality"" must satisfy the axioms of
probability theory. I argue here that these theorems do not in themselves
demonstrate that probabilistic models are in fact suitable for any specific
task in automated reasoning or plausible for cognitive models. First, the
theorems only establish that there exists some probabilistic model; they do not
establish that there exists a useful probabilistic model, i.e. one with a
tractably small number of numerical parameters and a large number of
independence assumptions. Second, there are in general many different
probabilistic models for a given situation, many of which may be far more
irrational, in the usual sense of the term, than a model that violates the
axioms of probability theory. I illustrate this second point with an extended
examples of two tasks of induction, of a similar structure, where the
reasonable probabilistic models are very different.

processes in fluid dynamics is investigated here, in the simplest cases of
inviscid 2D isotropic Burgers and pressureless Euler-Coriolis fluids
respectively modeled by single vortices confined in compressible, local,
inertial and global, rotating, environments. The field equations are
established, inductively, starting from the equations of the characteristics
solved with an initial Helmholtz decomposition of the velocity fields namely a
vorticity free and a divergence free part and, deductively, by means of a
canonical Hamiltonian Clebsch like formalism, implying two pairs of conjugate
variables. Two vector valued fields are constants of the motion: the velocity
field in the Burgers case and the momentum field per unit mass in the
Euler-Coriolis one. Taking advantage of this property, a class of solutions for
the mass densities of the fluids is given by the Jacobian of their sum with
respect to the actual coordinates. Implementation of the isotropy hypothesis
results in the cancellation of the dilatation-rotational cross terms in the
Jacobian. A simple expression is obtained for all the radially symmetric
Jacobians occurring in the theory. Representative examples of regular and
singular solutions are shown and the competition between dilatation and
vorticity is illustrated. Inspired by thermodynamical, mean field theoretical
analogies, a genuine variational formula is proposed which yields unique
measure solutions for the radially symmetric fluid densities investigated. We
stress that this variational formula, unlike the Hopf-Lax formula, enables us
to treat systems which are both compressible and rotational. Moreover in the
one-dimensional case, we show for an interesting application that both
variational formulas are equivalent.

with implications for the information paradox. In this paper we conjecture a
construction of non-supersymmetric supergravity solutions describing D-brane
configurations which carry mass and angular momentum, but no other conserved
charges. We first study a classical string solution which locally carries
dipole winding and momentum charges in two compact directions, but globally
carries no net winding or momentum charge. We investigate its backreaction in
the D1-D5 duality frame, where this object becomes a supertube which locally
carries oscillating dipole D1-D5 and NS1-NS5 charges, and again carries no net
charge. In the limit of an infinite straight supertube, we find an exact
supergravity solution describing this object. We conjecture that a similar
construction may be carried out based on a class of two-charge
non-supersymmetric D1-D5 solutions. These results are a step towards
demonstrating how neutral black hole microstates may be constructed in string
theory.

coherent muon-to-electron conversion in the presence of a nucleus with a
sensitivity four orders of magnitude beyond current limits. The experiment will
have a single event sensitivity of about $2.5\times10^{-17}$ while limiting the
total background to less than 0.5 events. One potential background is due to
cosmic-ray muons producing an electron that is indistinguishable from signal
within the Mu2e apparatus. The cosmic-ray-veto system of the Mu2e experiment is
tasked with vetoing cosmic-ray-induced backgrounds with high efficiency without
inducing significant dead time and while operating in a high-intensity
environment. In this note the challenges related to the high-radiation
environment that influence the design of the cosmic-ray-veto system will be
discussed.

permutation entropy with Lempel-Ziv complexity, to design what we call
Lempel-Ziv permutation complexity. The principle consists of two steps: (i)
transformation of a continuous-state series that is intrinsically multivariate
or arises from embedding into a sequence of permutation vectors, where the
components are the positions of the components of the initial vector when
re-arranged; (ii) performing the Lempel-Ziv complexity for this series of
`symbols', as part of a discrete finite-size alphabet. On the one hand, the
permutation entropy of Bandt-Pompe aims at the study of the entropy of such a
sequence; i.e., the entropy of patterns in a sequence (e.g., local increases or
decreases). On the other hand, the Lempel-Ziv complexity of a discrete-state
sequence aims at the study of the temporal organization of the symbols (i.e.,
the rate of compressibility of the sequence). Thus, the Lempel-Ziv permutation
complexity aims to take advantage of both of these methods. The potential from
such a combined approach - of a permutation procedure and a complexity analysis
- is evaluated through the illustration of some simulated data and some real
data. In both cases, we compare the individual approaches and the combined
approach.

to explain the observation of large dust asymmetries in several transitional
discs. However, whether or not vortex formation operates in layered accretion
discs, i.e. models of protoplanetary discs including dead zones near the disc
midplane --- regions that are magnetically inactive and the effective viscosity
greatly reduced --- has not been verified. As a first step toward testing the
robustness of vortex formation in layered discs, we present non-linear
hydrodynamical simulations of global 3D protoplanetary discs with an imposed
kinematic viscosity that increases away from the disc midplane. Two sets of
numerical experiments are performed: (i) non-axisymmetric instability of
artificial radial density bumps in viscous discs; (ii) vortex-formation at
planetary gap edges in layered discs. Experiment (i) shows that the linear
instability is largely unaffected by viscosity and remains dynamical. The
disc-planet simulations also show the initial development of vortices at gap
edges, but in layered discs the vortices are transient structures which
disappear well into the non-linear regime. We suggest that the long term
survival of columnar vortices, such as those formed via the RWI, requires low
effective viscosity throughout the vertical extent of the disc, so such
vortices do not persist in layered discs.

respect to the prevalence of stellar flybys. Planetary ejection and collision
with the parent star should be more common towards the bulge. At a given
location anywhere in the Galaxy, if the mass loss is adiabatic, then the
secondary is likely to avoid close flybys during AGB evolution, and cannot
eventually escape the resulting WD because of Galactic tides alone. Partly
because AGB mass loss will shrink a planetary system's Hill ellipsoid axes by
about 20 to 40 per cent, Oort clouds orbiting WDs are likely to be more

of two different methods to identify the diffuse stellar light in cosmological

dynamical analysis of the stellar component. The second method is closer to
techniques commonly employed in observational studies. Both the dynamical
method and the method based on the surface brightness limit criterion are
applied to the same set of hydrodynamical simulations for a large sample about
80 galaxy clusters.
  We find significant differences between the ICL and DSC fractions computed
with the two corresponding methods, which amounts to about a factor of two for
the AGN simulations, and a factor of four for the CSF set. We also find that
the inclusion of AGN feedback boosts the DSC and ICL fractions by a factor of
1.5-2, respectively, while leaving the BCG+ICL and BCG+DSC mass fraction almost
unchanged. The sum of the BCG and DSC mass stellar mass fraction is found to
decrease from ~80 per cent in galaxy groups to ~60 per cent in rich clusters,
thus in excess of what found from observational analysis.
  We identify the average surface brightness limits that yields the ICL
fraction from the SBL method close to the DSC fraction from the dynamical
method. These surface brightness limits turn out to be brighter in the CSF than
in the AGN simulations. This is consistent with the finding that AGN feedback
makes BCGs to be less massive and with shallower density profiles than in the
CSF simulations. The BCG stellar component, as identified by both methods, are
slightly older and more metal-rich than the stars in the diffuse component.

statistical measurement of the local galaxy density, we use a ""dynamical""
approach, where galaxies are classified according to three different
environment regimes: group, ""filament-like"", and field. Both methods show no
evidence of a SFR-density reversal. Moreover, group galaxies show a mean SFR
lower than other environments up to z~1, while at earlier epochs group and
field galaxies exhibit consistent levels of star formation (SF) activity. We
find that processes related to a massive dark matter halo must be dominant in
the suppression of the SF below z~1, with respect to purely density-related
processes. We confirm this finding by studying the distribution of galaxies in
different environments with respect to the so-called Main Sequence (MS) of
star-forming galaxies. Galaxies in both group and ""filament-like"" environments
preferentially lie below the MS up to z~1, with group galaxies exhibiting lower
levels of star-forming activity at a given mass. At z>1, the star-forming
galaxies in groups reside on the MS. Groups exhibit the highest fraction of
quiescent galaxies up to z~1, after which group, ""filament-like"", and field

the most efficient locus for star-formation quenching. Thus, a fundamental
difference exists between bound and unbound objects, or between dark matter
haloes of different masses.

the continuum 2-10 keV flux decreased of ~20% with respect to previous

that uses a bi-chromatic refractive index distribution and nearest neighbor
couplings of the type found in Glauber-Fock lattices. This allows us to escape
the restriction of staying near the Brillouin zone imposed by the classical

cross-correlation technique to measure bias factors associated with
2-distributed quantities. We validate the method with numerical realizations of

focus on the lowest (quadratic) order nonlocal contributions. We can reproduce
our measurement of \chi_{10} if we allow for an offset between the Lagrangian
halo center-of-mass and the peak position. The sign and magnitude of \chi_{10}
is consistent with Lagrangian haloes sitting near linear density maxima. The
resulting contribution to the halo bias can safely be ignored for M = 10^13
Msun/h, but could become relevant at larger halo masses. For the second
nonlocal bias \chi_{01} however, we measure a much larger magnitude than
predicted by our model. We speculate that some of this discrepancy might
originate from nonlocal Lagrangian contributions induced by nonspherical

inside-out formation scenario. The model reproduces the three main
observational constraints of the M31 disk: the radial distributions of the
total baryonic mass, the gas mass, and the O/H abundance. The model shows good
agreement with the observed: SFR(r), Mstars(r), the C/H, N/H, Mg/H, Si/H, S/H,
Ar/H, Cr/H, Fe/H, and Z gradients. From reproducing the observed gas mass, we
find that the star formation efficiency is variable in space, for the whole
disk, and is constant in time for most of the evolution (t< 12.8 Gyr). From
reproducing the observed SFR, we find that the efficiency decreases almost to
zero for 12.8<t(Gyr)< 13.0 and r>12 kpc. All the predicted Xi/H(r) gradients
show three different slopes, due to the r-dependence of the the star formation
efficiency and the inside-out galactic formation.

mechanical Casimir effect arising from quantized field fluctuations between
plates with inhomogeneous, sharply discontinuous, dielectric properties. While
the Casimir effect is a relatively well understood phenomenon, systems
resulting in lateral or rotational forces are far less developed; to our
knowledge, a theoretical study of discontinuous dielectric variants of such
systems has not been attempted. We utilize a Proximity Force Approximation in
conjunction with the Lifshitz dielectric formula to perform theoretical
analyses of resultant torques in systems with bisected and quadrisected
dielectric regions. We also develop a high precision Monte Carlo type numerical
integrator to approximate our derived expressions. Our calculations of an
energy density linear with the alignment angle result in a constant torque and
have implications in NEMS (nano electromechanical systems) and MEMS (micro

of static electron lattices, in a mathematically rigorous way one commonly
truncates the lattice sum and the corresponding integral and takes the limit
along expanding hypercubes or other regular geometric shapes. We generalize the
known mathematically rigorous two and three dimensional results regarding
Wigner limits, as laid down in [Analysis of certain lattice sums, D. Borwein,
J. M. Borwein, and R. Shail, 1989], to integer lattices of arbitrary dimension.
In doing so, we also resolve a problem posed in Chapter 7 of [Lattice Sums:

lattice sums first, before treating the case of arbitrary quadratic forms. We
also consider limits taken along expanding hyperballs with respect to general
norms, and connect with classical topics such as Gauss's circle problem. An
appendix is included to recall certain properties of Epstein zeta functions

  tomography",,,,,"physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: CT image reconstruction techniques have two major categories:
analytical reconstruction (AR) method and iterative reconstruction (IR) method.
AR reconstructs images through analytical formulas, such as filtered
backprojection (FBP) in 2D and Feldkamp-Davis-Kress (FDK) method in 3D, which
can be either mathematically exact or approximate. On the other hand, IR is
often based on the discrete forward model of X-ray transform and formulated as
a minimization problem with some appropriate image regularization method, so
that the reconstructed image corresponds to the minimizer of the optimization
problem. This work is to investigate the fused analytical and iterative
reconstruction (AIR) method.
  Methods: Based on IR with L1-type image regularization, AIR is formulated
with a AR-specific preconditioner in the data fidelity term, which results in
the minimal change of the solution algorithm that replaces the adjoint X-ray
transform by the filtered X-ray transform. As a proof-of-concept 2D example of
AIR, FBP is incorporated into tensor framelet (TF) regularization based IR, and
the formulated AIR minimization problem is then solved through split Bregman
method with GPU-accelerated X-ray transform and filtered adjoint X-ray
transform.
  Conclusion: AIR, the fused Analytical and Iterative Reconstruction method, is
proposed with a proof-of-concept 2D example to synergize FBP and TF-regularized
IR, with improved image resolution and contrast for experimental data. The
potential impact of AIR is that it offers a general framework to develop
various AR enhanced IR methods, when neither AR nor IR alone is sufficient.

  Science Experimental Facility",,,,,"physics.ins-det hep-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a definite search for sterile neutrinos at the J-PARC Materials
and Life Science Experimental Facility (MLF). With the 3 GeV Rapid Cycling
Synchrotron (RCS) and spallation neutron target, an intense neutrino beam from
muon decay at rest (DAR) is available. Neutrinos come from \mu+ decay, and the
oscillation to be searched for is (anti \nu \mu -> anti \nu e) which is
detected by the inverse \beta decay interaction (anti \nu e + p -> e+ + n),
followed by a gamma from neutron capture.
  The unique features of the proposed experiment, compared with the LSND and
experiments using horn focused beams, are;
  (1) The pulsed beam with about 600 ns spill width from J-PARC RCS and muon
long lifetime allow us to select neutrinos from \mu DAR only.
  (2) Due to nuclear absorption of \pi- and \mu-, neutrinos from \mu- decay are
suppressed to about the $10^{-3}$ level.
  (3) Neutrino cross sections are well known. The inverse \beta decay cross
section is known to be a few percent accuracy.
  (4) The neutrino energy can be calculated from positron energy by adding ~1.8
MeV.
  (5) The anti \nu \mu and \nu e fluxes have different and well defined
spectra. This allows us to separate oscillated signals from those due to \mu-
decay contamination.
  We propose to proceed with the oscillation search in steps since the region
of \Delta m^2 to be searched can be anywhere between sub-eV^2 to several tens
of eV^2. We start to examine the large \Delta m^2 region, which can be done
with short baseline at first. At close distance to the MLF target gives a high
neutrino flux, and allows us to use relatively small detector.
  If no definitive positive signal is found, a future option exists to cover
small \Delta m^2 region. This needs a relatively long baseline and requires a
large detector to compensate for the reduced neutrino flux.

curious features in solar explosive events. A spine field line links distinct

report a unique event observed by the Solar Dynamic Observatory where a set of
hot coronal loops (over 10 MK) connected to a quasi-circular chromospheric
ribbon at one end and a remote brightening at the other. Magnetic field
extrapolation suggests these loops are partly tracer of the evolving spine
field line. Continuous slipping- and null-point-type reconnections were likely
at work, energizing the loop plasma and transferring magnetic flux within and
across the fan quasi-separatrix layer. We argue that the initial reconnection
is of the ""breakout"" type, which then transitioned to a more violent flare
reconnection with an eruption from the fan dome. Significant magnetic field
changes are expected and indeed ensued. This event also features an
extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) late phase, i.e. a delayed secondary emission peak in
warm EUV lines (about 2-7 MK). We show that this peak comes from the cooling of
large post-reconnection loops beside and above the compact fan, a direct
product of eruption in such topological settings. The long cooling time of the
large arcades contributes to the long delay; additional heating may also be
required. Our result demonstrates the critical nature of cross-scale magnetic
coupling - topological change in a sub-system may lead to explosions on a much
larger scale.

matrix ensembles [Poissonian, Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE), Gaussian
Unitary Ensemble (GUE) and Gaussian Symplectic Ensemble (GSE)] realized in two
different microscopic models. The specific diagnostic tool used to study the
crossovers is the level spacing distribution. The first model is a one
dimensional lattice model of interacting hard core bosons (or equivalently spin
1/2 objects) and the other a higher dimensional model of non-interacting
particles with disorder and spin orbit coupling. We find that the perturbation
causing the crossover among the different ensembles scales to zero with system
size as a power law with an exponent that depends on the ensembles between
which the crossover takes place. This exponent is independent of microscopic
details of the perturbation. We also find that the crossover from the
Poissonian ensemble to the other three is dominated by the Poissonian to GOE
crossover which introduces level repulsion while the crossover from GOE to GUE
or GOE to GSE associated with symmetry breaking introduces a subdominant
contribution. We also conjecture that the exponent is dependent on whether the
system contains interactions among the elementary degrees of freedom or not and
is independent of the dimensionality of the system.

L-{\alpha}-alanine were investigated in microbial processes in the domain
Bacteria and in chemical processes in symmetric organic synthesis. D-alanine is
an enantiomer that is physiologically essential for microbial growth and
metabolic maintenance. The nitrogen isotopic difference {\Delta}15ND-L (defined
as {\delta}15ND-Ala - {\delta}15NL-Ala) in peptidoglycan amino acids in
bacteria such as the representative gram-positive phyla Firmicutes and
Actinobacteria (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus
staphylolyticus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus
luteus, and Streptomyces sp.) tended to be 15N-depleted in D-alanine
({\Delta}15ND-L < -2.0 permil). These results suggest that the composition of
isotopically heterogeneous components in these bacteria is primarily controlled
by enzymatic pathways prior to formation of the bacterial cell wall. In
contrast, the {\Delta}15ND-L of racemic alanine in the chemical pathway during
the nucleophilic substitution reaction (SN1 type) between 2-bromopropionic acid
and ammonia identified fully homogeneous components for each enantiomer. The
novel enantiomer-specific isotopic analysis (ESIA) method is useful in
determining the origins of chirality in biogenic and abiogenic processes and is
applicable to enantiomer studies.

which seems to suggest that fatigue SN curve can be entirely predicted on the
basis of the statistical distribution of static strengths. The original
abstract writes ""Expressions for the cycles to failure as a function of R ratio
are derived. These expressions do not require any curve fitting and do not
involve any experimentally determined parameters. The fatigue predictions do
not require any fatigue tests for calibration"". These surprisingly ambitious
claims and attractive results deserve careful scrutiny. We contend that the
results seem to be due to a number of approximations and incorrect derivations,
and one particular misleading assumption, which make the model not conform to a
fatigue testing in a given specimen with resulting SN curve distribution. The
quantitative agreement of some predictions (the scatter of distribution of
fatigue lives being close to the mode value found in typical composites of
aeronautical interest in the large Navy database) should not motivate any
enthusiasm. It is believed that a proper statistical treatment of the fatigue
process should not make wear-out constants disappear, and hence the SN curves
would depend on them, and not just on scatter of static data. These serious
concerns explain the large discrepancies found by 3 independent studies which
tried to apply Kassapoglou's model to composite fatigue data, and to other well
known results.

This paper reports an innovative statistical inference approach to discover a
comprehensive dictionary of protein structural building blocks from a large

on the Bayesian and information-theoretic criterion of minimum message length.
To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first systematic and rigorous
treatment of a very important data mining problem that arises in the
cross-disciplinary area of structural bioinformatics. The quality of the
dictionary we find is demonstrated by its explanatory power -- any protein
within the corpus of known 3D structures can be dissected into successive
regions assigned to fragments from this dictionary. This induces a novel
one-dimensional representation of three-dimensional protein folding patterns,
suitable for application of the rich repertoire of character-string processing
algorithms, for rapid identification of folding patterns of newly-determined
structures. This paper presents the details of the methodology used to infer
the dictionary of building blocks, and is supported by illustrative examples to
demonstrate its effectiveness and utility.

Although electrospun polymer fibers are increasingly exploited in many

improved physical properties, is still poorly investigated and understood.
Here, we unravel the internal structure of electrospun functional nanofibers
made by prototype conjugated polymers. The unique features of near field
optical measurements are exploited to investigate the nanoscale spatial
variation of the polymer density, evidencing the presence of a dense internal
core embedded in a less dense polymeric shell. Interestingly, nanoscale mapping
the fiber Young's modulus demonstrates that the dense core is stiffer than the
polymeric, less dense shell. These findings are rationalized by developing a
theoretical modeling and simulations of the polymer molecular structural
evolution during the electrospinning process. This model predicts that the
stretching of the polymer network induces a contraction towards the jet center
of the network with a local increase of the polymer density, as observed in the
solid structure. The found complex internal structure opens interesting
perspective for improving and tailoring the molecular morphology and
multifunctional electronic and optical properties of polymer fibers.

methodology for efficient stochastic superparameterization (SP) algorithms for
geophysical turbulence. Geophysical turbulence is characterized by significant
intermittent cascades of energy from the unresolved to the resolved scales

simulates large scale dynamics on a coarse grid in a physical domain, and
couples these dynamics to high-resolution simulations on periodic domains
embedded in the coarse grid. Stochastic SP replaces the nonlinear,
deterministic eddy equations on periodic embedded domains by quasilinear
stochastic approximations on formally infinite embedded domains. The result is
a seamless algorithm which never uses a small scale grid and is far cheaper
than conventional SP, but with significant success in difficult test problems.
Various design choices in the algorithm are investigated in detail here,
including decoupling the timescale of evolution on the embedded domains from
the length of the time step used on the coarse grid, and sensitivity to certain
assumed properties of the eddies (e.g. the shape of the assumed eddy energy
spectrum). The different design choices are compared and contrasted on a
stringent test suite for quasigeostrophic turbulence involving two-layer
dynamics on a beta-plane forced by an imposed background shear. The algorithms
developed are expected to be particularly useful in providing accurate and
efficient stochastic parameterizations for use in ensemble-based state
estimation and prediction.

at an astonishingly low fraction of strong fibers which can have importance for
applications. We show that in the ductile phase the size distribution of
breaking bursts has a power law functional form with an exponent \mu=2 followed
by an exponential cutoff. In the brittle phase the power law also prevails but
with a higher exponent \mu=9/2. The transition between the two phases shows
analogies to continuous phase transitions. Analyzing the microstructure of the
damage, it was found that at the beginning of the fracture process cracks
nucleate randomly, while later on growth and coalescence of cracks dominate
which give rise to power law distributed crack sizes.

condensed matter physics. Yet, in a number of materials, in particular the
high-temperature superconductors and the layered organic superconductors, they
fail. In these lecture notes for an international school, I emphasize that even
though the low energy properties of a phase of matter are generally emergent
and entirely determined by the broken symmetry, there are many differences
between a strongly correlated and a weakly correlated state of matter. For
example, spin waves are an emergent property for antiferromagnets, but for weak
correlations the normal phase of a (Slater) antiferromagnet is metallic,
whereas it is insulating (Heisenberg) for strong correlations. As a function of
interaction strength, above the antiferromagnetic phase, the crossover between
a metal and a local moment paramagnetic insulator is described by the Mott
transition, whose mean-field theory down to T=0 is best formulated with
dynamical mean-field theory. A similar situation occurs for superconductors:
despite similar emergent properties, there are many differences between both
kinds of superconductors. Experimental evidence suggests that hole-doped
cuprates are strongly correlated whereas the correlations are weaker in the
electron-doped case, especially near optimal doping. Evidence for a pseudogap
arising from antiferromagnetic fluctuations is strong in the latter case,
whereas in the hole-doped case the pseudogap temperature appears as a
consequence of Mott physics. In cluster dynamical mean-field theory, the
pseudogap line T* is a Widom line arising from a T=0 first-order transition
that terminates at a finite T critical point. Strongly correlated
superconductors are much more resilient to near-neighbor repulsion than their
weakly correlated counterpart. Many different methods to attack these problems
theoretically are described.

suspensions in a more complex manner than passive particles. For puller-like
microswimmers an increase in the viscosity has been observed. It has been
suggested that the persistence of the orientation of the microswimmers hinders
the rotation that is normally caused by the vorticity. It was previously shown
that some sorts of algaes are bottom-heavy swimmers, i.e. their centre of mass
is not located in the centre of the body. In this way, the algae affects the
vorticity of the flow when it is perpendicular oriented to the axis of gravity.
This orientation of gravity to vorticity is given in a rheometer that is
equipped with a cone-plate geometry. Here we present measurements of the
viscosity both in a cone-plate and a Taylor-Couette cell. The two set-ups
yielded the same increase in viscosity although the axis of gravitation in the
Taylor-Couette cell is parallel to the direction of vorticity. In a
complementary experiment we tested the orientation of the direction of swimming
through microscopic observation of single \textit{Chlamydomonas reinhardtii}
and could not identify a preferred orientation, i. e. our specific strain of
\textit{Chlamydomonas reinhardtii} are not bottom-heavy swimmers. We thus
conclude that bottom heaviness is not a prerequisite for the increase of
viscosity and that the effect of gravity on the rheology of our strain of
\textit{Chlamydomonas reinhardtii} is negligible. This finding reopens the
question of whether origin of persistence in the orientation of cells is
actually responsible for the increased viscosity of the suspension.

Here we focus on the case of strong stability where both nodes release fluid
with sufficiently high speeds to minimise their mutual influence. We show that,
like in the one-dimensional case, big jumps provide the main cause for queues
to become large, but now they may have multi-dimensional features. For deriving
these results, we develop an analytic approach that differs from the
traditional tail asymptotic studies, and obtain various weak tail equivalences.

magnetosphere of pulsar B by the magnetized wind from pulsar A, including
effects of magnetic reconnection and of the geodetic precession. Geodetic
precession leads to secular evolution of the geometric parameters and
effectively allows a 3D view of the magnetosphere. Using the two complimentary
models of pulsar B's magnetosphere, adapted from the Earth's magnetosphere
models by Tsyganenko (ideal pressure confinement) and Dungey (highly resistive
limit), we determine the precise location and shape of the coherent radio
emission generation region within pulsar B's magnetosphere. We successfully
reproduce orbital variations and secular evolution of the profile of B, as well
as subpulse drift (due to reconnection between the magnetospheric and wind
magnetic fields), and determine the location and the shape of the emission
region. The emission region is located at about 3750 stellar radii and has a
horseshoe-like shape, which is centered on the polar magnetic field lines. The
best fit angular parameters of the emission region indicate that radio emission
is generated on the field lines which, according to the theoretical models,
originate close to the poles and carry the maximum current. When considered
together, the results of the two models converge and can explain why the
modulation of B's radio emission at A's period is observed only within a
certain orbital phase region. Our results imply that the wind of pulsar A has a
striped structure only 1000 light cylinder radii away. We discuss the
implications of these results for pulsar magnetospheric models, mechanisms of
coherent radio emission generation, and reconnection rates in relativistic

variability. From 2000 to 2013.5 a GST plateau is observed while the GCMs
predicted a warming rate of about 2 K/century. In contrast, the hypothesis that
the climate is regulated by specific natural oscillations more accurately fits
the GST records at multiple time scales. The climate sensitivity to CO2
doubling should be reduced by half, e.g. from the IPCC-2007 2.0-4.5 K range to
1.0-2.3 K with 1.5 C median. Also modern paleoclimatic temperature

scales plus a 50% attenuated radiative warming component deduced from the GCM
mean simulation as a measure of the anthropogenic and volcano contributions to
climatic changes. The semi empirical model reconstructs the 1850-2013 GST
patterns significantly better than any CMIP5 GCM simulation. The model projects
a possible 2000-2100 average warming ranging from about 0.3 C to 1.8 C that is

of physics should have the same forms in all admissible frames of reference,
i.e., form-invariance is an intrinsic property of correct wave equations.
However, so far in the design of metamaterials by transformation methods, the
form-invariance is always proved by using certain relations between field
variables before and after coordinate transformation. The main contribution of
this paper is to give general proofs of form-invariance of electromagnetic,
sound and elastic wave equations in the global Cartesian coordinate system
without using any assumption of the relation between field variables. The
results show that electromagnetic wave equations and sound wave equations are
intrinsically form-invariant, but traditional elastodynamic equations are not.
As a by-product, one can naturally obtain new elastodynamic equations in the
time domain that are locally accurate to describe the elastic wave propagation
in inhomogeneous media. The validity of these new equations is demonstrated by
some numerical simulations of a perfect elastic wave rotator and an approximate
elastic wave cloak. These findings are important for solving inverse scattering
problems in many fields such as seismology, nondestructive evaluation and
metamaterials.

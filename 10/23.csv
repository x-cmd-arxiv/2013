of transmission through subwavelength apertures penetrating metal films. We
show that cavity mode theory applies to an effective resonant cavity whose
dimensions are determined by the aperture's geometry and the evanescent decay
lengths of the associated diffracted waves. This method suggests a concrete
physical mechanism for the enhanced transmission observed in periodic aperture
arrays, namely it is the evanescently scattered light, localized in the near
field of metal surface, which couples into the apertures. Furthermore, it
analytically predicts the frequencies of peaks in enhanced transmission, the
quality factor of the peaks, and explains their dependence on variation in the
hole radius, periodicity, and the film thickness over a wide range of
geometries. This model demonstrates strong correlation to simulation and
existing results with a high degree of accuracy.

susceptibility and specific heat data in both single- and poly-crystals show

with the stabilization of superconductivity. Combined with the band calculation
results showing the Fermi surfaces with 1D character, we postulate that the

mobility caused by close encounters with (10) Hygiea is also accounted for,

families associated with massive bodies. In our taxonomical analysis of the

shell of liquid to detach and continue to travel inwards, compressing the gas
bubble. The efficiency of compression and collapse evolution can be affected by
development of the RM instability. Investigations have been performed in the

signal in a pair of bases. When both bases are orthogonal, it is known that the
sparse representation is unique when the sparsity $K$ of the signal satisfies
$K<1/\mu(D)$, where $\mu(D)$ is the mutual coherence of the dictionary.
Furthermore, the sparse representation can be obtained in polynomial time by
Basis Pursuit (BP), when $K<0.91/\mu(D)$. Therefore, there is a gap between the
unicity condition and the one required to use the polynomial-complexity BP
formulation. For the case of general dictionaries, it is also well known that
finding the sparse representation under the only constraint of unicity is
NP-hard.
  In this paper, we introduce, for the case of Fourier and canonical bases, a
polynomial complexity algorithm that finds all the possible $K$-sparse
representations of a signal under the weaker condition that $K<\sqrt{2}
/\mu(D)$. Consequently, when $K<1/\mu(D)$, the proposed algorithm solves the
unique sparse representation problem for this structured dictionary in
polynomial time. We further show that the same method can be extended to many
other pairs of bases, one of which must have local atoms. Examples include the
union of Fourier and local Fourier bases, the union of discrete cosine

for understanding social intelligence, collective cognition, and potential
applications in engineering, artificial intelligence, and robotics. An
important biological aspect of these studies is discerning which selection
pressures favor the evolution of grouping behavior. In the past decade,
researchers have begun using evolutionary computation to study the evolutionary
effects of these selection pressures in predator-prey models. The selfish herd
hypothesis states that concentrated groups arise because prey selfishly attempt
to place their conspecifics between themselves and the predator, thus causing
an endless cycle of movement toward the center of the group. Using an
evolutionary model of a predator-prey system, we show that how predators attack
is critical to the evolution of the selfish herd. Following this discovery, we
show that density-dependent predation provides an abstraction of Hamilton's
original formulation of ``domains of danger.'' Finally, we verify that
density-dependent predation provides a sufficient selective advantage for prey
to evolve the selfish herd in response to predation by coevolving predators.
Thus, our work corroborates Hamilton's selfish herd hypothesis in a digital
evolutionary model, refines the assumptions of the selfish herd hypothesis, and
generalizes the domain of danger concept to density-dependent predation.

existence of perfect matchings or Hamilton cycles in graphs subject to certain
constraints. The most general form of these constraints is that we are given a
family of sets of edges of our graph and are not allowed to use all the edges
of any member of this family. We consider two natural ways of expressing
constraints of this kind using graphs and using set systems.
  For the first version we ask for conditions on regular bipartite graphs $G$
and $H$ for there to exist a perfect matching in $G$, no two edges of which
form a $4$-cycle with two edges of $H$.
  In the second, we ask for conditions under which a Hamilton cycle in the
complete graph (or equivalently a cyclic permutation) exists, with the property
that it has no collection of intervals of prescribed lengths whose union is an
element of a given family of sets. For instance we prove that the smallest
family of $4$-sets with the property that every cyclic permutation of an

reconstruction/interpolation strategies have been applied to kinetic
simulations. For example, the order of spatial accuracy of the algorithms
proposed in {[Qiu and Christlieb, J. Comp. Phys., 2010]} is very high (as high
as ninth order). However, the temporal error is dominated by the operator
splitting error, which is second order for Strang splitting. It is therefore
important to overcome such low order splitting error, in order to have
numerical algorithms that achieve higher orders of accuracy in both space and
time. In this paper, we propose to use the integral deferred correction (IDC)
method to reduce the splitting error. Specifically, the temporal order accuracy
is increased by $r$ with each correction loop in the IDC framework, where
$r=1,\,2$ for coupling the first order splitting and the Strang splitting,
respectively. The proposed algorithm is applied to the Vlasov-Poisson system,
the guiding center model, and two dimensional incompressible flow simulations
in the vorticity stream-function formulation. We show numerically that the IDC
procedure can automatically increase the order of accuracy in time. We also
investigate numerical stability of the proposed algorithm via performing
Fourier analysis to a linear model problem.

being the best possible exponential upper bound on P(X\geq x), is shown to be
stable and monotonic in a, x, and X, where x is a real number and X is a random
variable. The bounds P_a(X;x) are optimal values in certain minimization

bounds Q_a(X;p) on the (1-p)-quantile of X is stable and monotonic in a, p, and
X, with Q_0(X;p) equal the largest (1-p)-quantile of X. In certain sense, the
quantile bounds Q_a(X;p) are usually close enough to the true quantiles
Q_0(X;p). Moreover, Q_a(X;p) is subadditive in X if a\geq 1, as well as
positive-homogeneous and translation-invariant, and thus is a so-called
coherent measure of risk. A number of other useful properties of the bounds
P_a(X;x) and Q_a(X;p) are established. In particular, quite similarly to the
bounds P_a(X;x) on the tail probabilities, the quantile bounds Q_a(X;p) are the
optimal values in certain minimization problems. This allows for a
comparatively easy incorporation of the bounds P_a(X;x) and Q_a(X;p) into more
specialized optimization problems. It is shown that the minimization problems
for which P_a(X;x) and Q_a(X;p) are the optimal values are in a certain sense
dual to each other; in the case a=\infty this corresponds to the bilinear
Legendre--Fenchel duality. In finance, the (1-p)-quantile Q_0(X;p) is known as
the value-at-risk (VaR), whereas the value of Q_1(X;p) is known as the
conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) and also as the expected shortfall (ES),
average value-at-risk (AVaR), and expected tail loss (ETL). It is shown that
the quantile bounds Q_a(X;p) can be used as measures of economic inequality.

investigated here by means of a thorough dynamical analysis. While the system
is underdetermined, and one can always find a set of functions reproducing any
expansion history, we are able to determine general compatibility conditions
for these functions by requiring a viable background cosmology. In particular,
we identify a set of variables that allows us to transform the non-autonomous
system of equations into an infinite-dimensional one characterized by a
significant recursive structure. We then analyze several autonomous
sub-systems, obtained truncating the original one at increasingly higher
dimension, that correspond to increasingly general models of dark energy and
modified gravity. Furthermore, we exploit the recursive nature of the system to
draw some general conclusions on the different cosmologies that can be
recovered within the EFT formalism and the corresponding compatibility
requirements for the EFT functions. The machinery that we set up serves
different purposes. It offers a general scheme for performing dynamical
analysis of dark energy and modified gravity models within the model
independent framework of EFT; the general results, obtained with this
technique, can be projected into specific models, as we show in one example. It
also can be used to determine appropriate ansatze for the three EFT background
functions when studying the dynamics of cosmological perturbations in the

rapidity and azimuthal angle dependence of the resulting charge balance
function using a simple analytic model of heavy-ion collision evolution. Our
results are in agreement with experimental measurements, indicating that
hydrodynamic fluctuations contribute significantly to the measured charge
correlations in high energy heavy-ion collisions. The sensitivity of the
balance function to the value of the charge diffusion coefficient D allows us
to estimate the typical value of this coefficient in the crossover region to be
rather small, of the order of 1/(2pi T), characteristic of a strongly coupled
plasma.

star formation within a projected radius of 200 kpc. A stacking analysis
reveals that dust reddening in these star-forming galaxies is positively
correlated with stellar mass and may be higher in the field than the cluster at
a fixed stellar mass. This may indicate a lower amount of gas in star-forming
cluster galaxies than in the field population. Also, H$\alpha$ equivalent
widths of star-forming galaxies in the cluster environment are still suppressed
below the level of the field. This suppression is most significant for lower
mass galaxies (log M$_{*}$ < 10.0 M$_{\odot}$). We therefore conclude that

techniques to discrete processes was unclear; ad hoc extensions had some
success. We pointed out in Carron and Szapudi (2013) that the logarithmic
transform approximates extremely well the optimal ""sufficient statistics"",
observables that extract all information from the (continuous) matter field.
Building on these results, we generalize optimal transforms to discrete galaxy
fields. We focus our calculations on the Poisson sampling of an underlying
lognormal density field. We solve and test the one-point case in detail, and
sketch out the sufficient observables for the multi-point case. Moreover, we
present an accurate approximation to the sufficient observables in terms of the
mean and spectrum of a non-linearly transformed field. We find that the
corresponding optimal non-linear transformation is directly related to the
maximum a posteriori Bayesian reconstruction of the underlying continuous field
with a lognormal prior as put forward in Kitaura et al (2010). Thus simple
recipes for realizing the sufficient observables can be built on previously
proposed algorithms that have been successfully implemented and tested in

that $z\sim 1.4$ represents a transition redshift for the ISCS sample, with
clear evidence of an unquenched era of cluster star formation at earlier times.
Beyond this redshift the fraction of star-forming cluster members increases
monotonically toward the cluster centers. Indeed, the specific star formation
rate in the cores of these distant clusters is consistent with field values at
similar redshifts, indicating that at $z>1.4$ environment-dependent quenching
had not yet been established in ISCS clusters. Combining these observations
with complementary studies showing a rapid increase in the AGN fraction, a
stochastic star formation history, and a major merging episode at the same

merger-driven and that the subsequent quenching is due to feedback from
merger-fueled AGN. The totality of the evidence suggests we are witnessing the
final quenching period that brings an end to the era of star formation in
galaxy clusters and initiates the era of passive evolution.

clusters from the IRAC Shallow Cluster Survey (ISCS) selected as rest-frame

analysis allows us to quantify the evolution of SF in clusters over a long
redshift baseline without bias against active cluster systems. Using a stacking
analysis, we determine the average star formation rates (SFRs) and
specific-SFRs (SSFR=SFR/M$_{\star}$) of stellar mass-limited (M>1.3x10$^{10}$
M$_{\odot}$), statistical samples of cluster and field galaxies, probing both
the star forming and quiescent populations. We find a clear indication that the
average SF in cluster galaxies is evolving more rapidly than in the field, with
field SF levels at z>1.2 in the cluster cores (r<0.5 Mpc), in good agreement
with previous ISCS studies. By quantifying the SF in cluster and field galaxies
as an exponential function of cosmic time, we determine that cluster galaxies
are evolving ~2 times faster than the field. Additionally, we see enhanced SF
above the field level at z~1.4 in the cluster outskirts (r>0.5 Mpc). These
general trends in the cluster cores and outskirts are driven by the lower mass
galaxies in our sample. Blue cluster galaxies have systematically lower SSFRs
than blue field galaxies, but otherwise show no strong differential evolution
with respect to the field over our redshift range. This suggests that the
cluster environment is both suppressing the star formation in blue galaxies on
long time-scales and rapidly transitioning some fraction of blue galaxies to
the quiescent galaxy population on short time-scales. We argue that our results

characterized by the eccentric Kozai-Lidov mechanism, where the inner orbit can
undergo large eccentricity and inclination oscillations. It was shown before
that starting with a circular inner orbit, large mutual inclination (40-140
degree) can produce long timescale modulations that drives the eccentricity to
extremely large value and can flip the orbit. Here, we demonstrate that
starting with an almost coplanar configuration, for eccentric inner and outer
orbits, the eccentricity of the inner orbit can still be excited to high
values, and the orbit can flip by ~180 degree, rolling over its major axis. The
~180 degree flip criterion and the flip timescale are described by simple
analytic expressions that depend on the initial orbital parameters. With tidal
dissipation, this mechanism can produce counter-orbiting exo-planetary systems.
In addition, we also show that this mechanism has the potential to enhance the

consider examples of the lightest elements, H and He, for which the isotopic

necessary to account properly for the intrinsic line asymmetry, which is

range of observations, the microscopic nature of dark matter is still unknown.
Attempts to detect WIMPs, the most commonly studied form, have not yet
succeeded. Some predictions are even in apparent conflict with observations
(e.g. cuspy-cored halos and `missing satellite problem'). Therefore, it is
important to consider different forms of CDM. We focus on dark matter comprised
of ultralight bosons that form a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC), described by a
complex scalar field, and solve the Klein-Gordon and Einstein field equations
to evolve the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. We find, in addition to
phases of radiation-, matter- and \Lambda-domination, an earlier phase of
scalar-field-domination. Moreover, while WIMP CDM is non-relativistic at all
times after it decouples, BEC scalar field dark matter (SFDM) is relativistic
at early times, evolving from stiff to radiation-like, before it becomes
non-relativistic (CDM-like) at late times. The timing of transitions between
these phases yields fundamental constraints on SFDM model parameters, particle
mass m and self-interaction coupling strength \lambda. We derive the range of
particle parameters required to match observations of the evolving background
universe, including the CMB and abundances of light elements produced by BBN,
characterized by N_eff, the effective number of neutrino species, and the epoch
of matter-radiation equality z_eq. This yields m >= 2.4*10^{-21} eV/c^2 and
9.5*10^{-19} eV^{-1}cm^3 <= \lambda/(mc^2)^2 <= 4*10^{-17} eV^{-1}cm^3. Our
model accommodates current observations in which N_eff at BBN is higher than at
z_eq, as probed by the CMB, otherwise unexplained by WIMP CDM. SFDM without
self-interaction (`Fuzzy Dark Matter') cannot satisfy current BBN constraints
within 68% confidence and is therefore disfavored.

selection consisting of three steps: screening--ordering--selection (SOS).
Screening of predictors is based on the thresholded Lasso that is l_1 penalized
least squares. The screened predictors are then fitted using least squares (LS)
and ordered with respect to their t statistics. Finally, a model is selected
using greedy generalized information criterion (GIC) that is l_0 penalized LS
in a nested family induced by the ordering. We give non-asymptotic upper bounds
on error probability of each step of the SOS algorithm in terms of both
penalties. Then we obtain selection consistency for different (n, p) scenarios
under conditions which are needed for screening consistency of the Lasso. For
the traditional setting (n >p) we give Sanov-type bounds on the error
probabilities of the ordering--selection algorithm. Its surprising consequence
is that the selection error of greedy GIC is asymptotically not larger than of
exhaustive GIC. We also obtain new bounds on prediction and estimation errors
for the Lasso which are proved in parallel for the algorithm used in practice
and its formal version.

dimensions, also called the quantum spin Hall state. In this review, we provide
a pedagogical introduction to the influence of correlation effects in the
quantum spin Hall states, with special focus on the half-filled

considered are two descendants of the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model, the generalized
and dimerized Kane-Mele-Hubbard model. From the $Z_2$ index, spin Chern numbers
and the Green's function behavior, one can observe that correlation effects
induce shifts of the topological phase boundaries. Although the implementation
of these topological quantities has been successfully employed in QMC
simulations to describe the topological phase transition, we also point out
their limitations as well as suggest possible future directions in using
numerical methods to characterize topological properties of strongly correlated

arbitrary number d of extra dimensions. Our method adapts the post-linear
formalism of General Relativity to the multidimensional case. The total emitted
energy, as well as its angular and frequency distribution and characteristic
values, are discussed in detail.
  For an electromagnetic mediation propagated in the bulk, the emitted energy
$E_{em}$ of scattering with impact parameter b has magnitude $E_{em} \sim e^4
e'^2 \gamma^{d+2}/(m^2 b^{3d+3})$, with dominant frequency $\omega_{em} \sim
\gamma^2/b$. For the gravitational force the charge emits via vector field,
propagated in the bulk, energy $E_{rad}\sim[G_D m' e]^2 \gamma^{d+2}/b^{3d+3}$
for $d \geq 2$, with dominant frequency $\omega\sim\gamma^2/b$ and energy
$E_{rad}\sim[G_5 m' e]^2\gamma^{3}\ln \gamma/b^{6}$ for $d=1$, with most of the
energy coming from a wide frequency region $\omega \in [\gamma/b),\gamma^2/b]
$. For the UED model with extra space volume $V=(2\pi R)^d$ the emitted energy
is $E_{UED}\sim (b^{d}/V)^2 E_{rad}$. Finally, for the ADD model, including
four dimensions, the electromagnetic field living on 3-brane, loses on emission
the energy $E_{ADD}\sim[G_D m'e]^2\gamma^{3}/(V b^{2d+3})$, with characteristic
frequency $\omega_{ADD}\sim\gamma/b$.
  The contribution of the low frequency part of the radiation (soft photons) to
the total radiated energy is shown to be negligible for all values of d. The
domain of validity of the classical result is discussed. The result is analyzed
from the viewpoint of the deWitt - Brehme - Hobbs equation (and corresponding
equations in higher dimensions).

performance field-effect devices have been achieved from monolayered materials
and their heterostructures, a p-n heterojunction diode derived from ultrathin
materials is notably absent and constrains the fabrication of complex

heterojunction diode using semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes
(s-SWCNTs) and single-layer molybdenum disulfide (SL-MoS2) as p-type and n-type

gap semiconductors forms a heterojunction with electrical characteristics that
can be tuned with an applied gate bias to achieve a wide range of charge
transport behavior ranging from insulating to rectifying with
forward-to-reverse bias current ratios exceeding 10^4. This heterojunction
diode also responds strongly to optical irradiation with an external quantum
efficiency (EQE) of 25% and fast photoresponse < 15 {\mu}s. Since SWCNTs have a
diverse range of electrical properties as a function of chirality, and since an
increasing number of atomically thin 2D nanomaterials are being isolated, the
gate-tunable p-n heterojunction concept presented here should be widely
generalizable to realize diverse ultrathin, high-performance electronics and

""irreducible"" (i.e., all partial combinations are less fit than the original
genotype) is one of the longest standing problems in evolutionary biology. In
standard genetics parlance, these adaptations require the crossing of a wide
adaptive valley of deleterious intermediate stages. Here we demonstrate, using
a simple model, that evolution can cross wide valleys to produce ""irreducibly
complex"" adaptations by making use of previously cryptic mutations. When
revealed by an evolutionary capacitor, previously cryptic mutants have higher
initial frequencies than do new mutations, bringing them closer to a
valley-crossing saddle in allele frequency space. Moreover, simple
combinatorics imply an enormous number of candidate combinations exist within
available cryptic genetic variation. We model the dynamics of crossing of a
wide adaptive valley after a capacitance event using both numerical simulations
and analytical approximations. Although individual valley crossing events
become less likely as valleys widen, by taking the combinatorics of genotype
space into account, we see that revealing cryptic variation can cause the
frequent evolution of complex adaptations. This finding also effectively
dismantles ""irreducible complexity"" as an argument against evolution by
providing a general mechanism for crossing wide adaptive valleys.

scattering problems. It shows some fundamental properties of the coefficients
such as symmetry and tensorial properties. The relationship between the
scattering coefficients and the far-field pattern is also derived. Furthermore,
the sensitivity of the scattering coefficients with respect to changes in the
permittivity and permeability distributions is investigated. In the linearized
case, explicit formulas for reconstructing permittivity and permeability
distributions from the scattering coefficients is proposed. They relate the
exponentially ill-posed character of the inverse medium scattering problem at a
fixed frequency to the exponential decay of the scattering coefficients.
Moreover, they show the stability of the reconstruction from multifrequency
measurements. This provides a new direction for solving inverse medium
scattering problems.

can be amplified as it scatters off the hole, a phenomenon known as
superradiant scattering. This scattering process in the superradiant regime
w<qQ/r_+ (here w, q, Q, and r_{+-} are the conserved frequency of the wave, the
charge coupling constant of the field, the electric charge of the black hole,
and the horizon radii of the black hole, respectively) results in the
extraction of Coulomb energy and electric charge from the charged black hole.
The black-hole-field system can be made unstable by placing a reflecting mirror
around the black hole which prevents the amplified field from escaping to
infinity. This charged black-hole-mirror system is the spherically symmetric
analogue of the rotating black-hole-mirror bomb of Press and Teukolsky. In the
present paper we study analytically the charged black-hole-mirror bomb in the
asymptotic regime qQ>>1 and for mirror radii r_m in the near-horizon region
x_m=(r_m-r_+)/r_+<<tau, where tau=(r_+-r_-)/r_+ is the dimensionless
temperature of the black hole. In particular, we derive analytic expressions
for the oscillation frequencies w_R and the instability growth timescales 1/w_I
of the superradiant confined fields. Remarkably, we find a simple linear
scaling w_I \propto qQ/r_+ for the imaginary part of the resonances in the
asymptotic qQ>>(tau/x_m)^2>>1 regime, which implies that the instability
timescale 1/w_I of the system can be made arbitrarily short in the
qQ-->infinity limit. The short instability timescale found in the linear regime
along with the spherical symmetry of the system, make the charged bomb a
convenient toy model for future numerical studies aimed to investigate the
non-linear end-state of superradiant instabilities.

energy models considered, showing the importance of considering the evolution
of $\beta$ in the cosmology-fits. Furthermore, it is found that varying $\beta$
can significantly change the fitting results of various cosmological
parameters: using the SNLS3 data alone, varying $\beta$ yields a larger
$\Omega_m$ for the $\Lambda$CDM model; using the SNLS3+CMB+GC data, varying
$\beta$ yields a larger $\Omega_m$ and a smaller $h$ for all the models.
Moreover, we find that these results are much closer to those given by the
CMB+GC data, compared to the cases of treating $\beta$ as a constant. This
indicates that considering the evolution of $\beta$ is very helpful for
reducing the tension between supernova and other cosmological observations.

stationary random metric on self-similar spaces which are the limit of nice
finite graphs: these are the so-called hierarchical graphs. They possess a
well-defined level structure and any level is built using a simple recursion.
Stopping the construction at any finite level, we have a discrete random metric
space when we set the edges to have random length (using a multiplicative
cascade with fixed law $m$). We introduce a tool, the cut-off process, by means
of which one finds that renormalizing the sequence of metrics by an exponential
factor, they converge in law to a non-trivial metric on the limit space. Such
limit law is stationary, in the sense that glueing together a certain number of
copies of the random limit space, according to the combinatorics of the brick
graph, the obtained random metric has the same law when rescaled by a random
factor of law $m$. In other words, the stationary random metric is the solution
of a distributional equation. When the measure $m$ has continuous positive
density on $\mathbf{R}_+$, the stationary law is unique up to rescaling and any
other distribution tends to a rescaled stationary law under the iterations of
the hierarchical transformation. We also investigate topological and geometric
properties of the random space when $m$ is $\log$-normal, detecting a phase
transition influenced by the branching random walk associated to the
multiplicative cascade.

also study the behaviour of the protocol on a special type of social graph,
called signed networks (e.g., Slashdot and Epinions), whose links indicate
stronger trust relationships. Finally, through our detailed analysis, we
demonstrate how a few simple additions to the protocol can improve the total

the trion and the hole in the Fermi Sea. The state has excitation energy which
is less then trion energy minus Fermi energy that can be obtained as a lower
edge of trion excitation band using the simple energy conservation low in the
picture of independent trion and electrons. The wave function of the correlated

Fermi Sea hole, r, as 1/r^3/2. The wave function can be normalized to unity and
it corresponds to correlated state of the trion and Fermi Sea hole. In contrast
to this state, the states with excitation energies in the absorption band
between the trion energy and the trion energy minus Fermi energy have complex
wave functions that decrease as 1/r^1/2. These states correspond to the trion

formation scenarios and to determine evolutionary stages of the young embedded

mass in the embedded clusters and its ratio to the stellar mass. S235 East1
appears to be less evolved than S235 East2 and S235 Central. In S235 East1 the
molecular gas mass exceeds that in the other clusters. Also, this cluster is
more embedded in the parent gas cloud than the other two. Comparison with a
theoretical model shows that the formation of these three clusters could have
been stimulated by the expansion of the Sh2-235 HII region (hereafter S235) via
a collect-and-collapse process, provided the density in the surrounding gas
exceeds $3\cdot10^3$ cm$^{-3}$, or via collapse of pre-existing clumps. The
expansion of S235 cannot be responsible for star formation in the southern S235
A-B region. However, formation of the massive stars in this region might have
been triggered by a large-scale supernova shock. Thus, triggered star formation
in the studied region may come in three varieties, namely collect-and-collapse
and collapse of pre-existing clumps, both initiated by expansion of the local
HII regions, and triggering by an external large-scale shock. We argue that the
C235 A HII region expands into a highly non-uniform medium with increasing
density. It is too young to trigger star formation in its vicinity by a
collect-and-collapse process. There is an age spread inside the S235 A-B
region. Massive stars in the S235 A-B region are considerably younger than
lower mass stars in the same area. This follows from the estimates of their

can be differentiated either by their physical characteristics (such as
reflectivity and texture) or social functions. Remote sensing techniques have
been recognized as a vital method for urban land use classification because of
their ability to capture the physical characteristics of land use. Although
significant progress has been achieved in remote sensing methods designed for
urban land use classification, most techniques focus on physical
characteristics, whereas knowledge of social functions is not adequately used.
Owing to the wide usage of mobile phones, the activities of residents, which
can be retrieved from the mobile phone data, can be determined in order to
indicate the social function of land use. This could bring about the
opportunity to derive land use information from mobile phone data. To verify
the application of this new data source to urban land use classification, we
first construct a time series of aggregated mobile phone data to characterize
land use types. This time series is composed of two aspects: the hourly
relative pattern, and the total call volume. A semi-supervised fuzzy c-means
clustering approach is then applied to infer the land use types. The method is
validated using mobile phone data collected in Singapore. Land use is
determined with a detection rate of 58.03%. An analysis of the land use
classification results shows that the accuracy decreases as the heterogeneity
of land use increases, and increases as the density of cell phone towers
increases.

affected. For Mn$_{1+x}$Ni$_{2-x}$Ga where 1$\geq$$x$$\geq$0, as $x$ decreases,
Mn$_{\rm Mn}$ moment increases while Mn$_{\rm Ni}$ moment decreases in both
austenite and martensite phases. For $x$$\geq$ 0.25, the total moment of the
martensite phase is smaller compared to the austenite phase, which indicates
possible occurrence of inverse magnetocaloric effect. We find that the
redistribution of Ni 3$d$- Mn$_{\rm Ni}$ 3$d$ minority spin electron states
close to the Fermi level is primarily responsible for the stability of the
martensite phase in Mn-Ni-Ga.

30 GeV/nuc are increasingly obscured from view at Earth by solar modulation,
the lower the energy. These charged particles encounter significant changes in
the heliosphere, over an 11-year cycle, which include processes such as
convection, diffusion, adiabatic energy losses and gradient, curvature and
current sheet drifts. Particle drifts cause chargesign dependent modulation and
a 22-year cycle, adding complexity to determining the respective very LIS from
observations only at Earth. However, with measurements now made by the Voyager
1 spacecraft in the vicinity of the heliopause, it is possible to determine a
very LIS for galactic electrons between about 5 MeV and about 120 MeV. At these
low energies also galactic protons observed in the outer heliosphere had been
completely obscured by the so-call anomalous component which is accelerated
inside the heliosheath. Since August 2012, these anomalous cosmic rays are
substantially depleted at Voyager 1 so that also for cosmic ray ions it is now
possible to obtain a lower limit to their very LIS. Combining numerical
modelling of solar modulation with the accurate measurements by the PAMELA
mission and with Voyager observations, the lower limit of the very LIS for
electrons, protons and helium, and other ions, can be determined from about 5
MeV and above. These spectra are called heliopause spectra, considered to be
the lowest possible very LIS. Also from an astrophysics point of view, the
determination of what can be called a very LIS, not just an averaged galactic
spectrum, is encouraging. The mentioned aspects are discussed, focussing on a
comparison of recent heliospheric observations and corresponding solar
modulation modelling.

the limitations of any particular equation of state towards describing all
existing dark energy models, we work with three different equation of state
covering a broader class of dark energy models and, hence, provide more robust
and generic constraints on the dark energy properties. We show that a clear
tension exists between dark energy constraints from CMB and non-CMB
observations when one allows for dark energy models having both phantom and
non-phantom behavior; while CMB is more favorable to phantom models, the low-z
data prefers model with behavior close to a Cosmological Constant. Further, we
reconstruct the equation of state of dark energy as a function of redshift
using the results from combined CMB and non-CMB data and find that Cosmological
Constant lies outside the 1$\sigma$ band for multiple dark energy models
allowing phantom behavior. A considerable fine tuning is needed to keep models
with strict non-phantom history inside 2$\sigma$ allowed range. This result
might motivate one to construct phantom models of dark energy,which is
achievable in the presence of higher derivative operators as in string theory.
However, disallowing phantom behavior, based only on strong theoretical prior,
leads to both CMB and non-CMB datasets agree on the nature of dark energy, with
the mean equation of state being very close to the Cosmological Constant.
Finally, to illustrate the impact of additional dark energy parameters on other
cosmological parameters, we provide the cosmological parameter constraints for

field-matching effects we observe suggest the prevalence of periodic pinning,
and indicate that at the matching field each vortex line is bound to an
artificial pinning site. However, the vortex-glass transition dimensionality,
quasi-2D instead of the usual 3D, evidences reduced vortex-glass correlations
along the vortex line. This is also supported by an unusual angular dependence
of the magneto-resistance, which greatly differs from that of Bose-glass

change in the random dynamics at the underlying deterministic bifurcation
point, characterized by the transition from a hyperbolic to a non-hyperbolic

independent processes in distributed systems. Higher-order types are needed in
order to properly structure delegation of responsibility between processes.
  In this paper we show that higher-order web-service contracts can be used to
provide a fully-abstract model of recursive higher-order session types. The
model is set-theoretic, in the sense that the meaning of a contract is given in
terms of the set of contracts with which it complies.
  The proof of full-abstraction depends on a novel notion of the complement of
a contract. This in turn gives rise to an alternative to the type duality
commonly used in systems for type-checking session types. We believe that the
notion of complement captures more faithfully the behavioural intuition
underlying type duality.

power spectrum and its variance, can amplify the signal of the free-free
process in the plasma. The damping of fluctuations on scales smaller than the
DM particle free streaming scale corresponds to a suppression of the total
matter power spectrum on large wave numbers k. We derive the time evolution of
the variance of the matter power spectrum for various cosmological models and
parameters by numerically computing the power spectrum with a modified version
of the Boltzmann code CAMB, for different values of the cut-off parameter kmax.
Suitable analytical approximations of the numerical results are presented. We
then characterize the CMB free-free spectral distortion accounting for the
amplification effect coming from clumping factor. Indeed, the clumpiness,
associated to the density contrast of the intergalactic medium, increases at
decreasing redshift. The analysis is carried out for selected astrophysical and
phenomenological cosmological reionization histories, for which we evaluate the
impact of the clumping factor on the free-free distortion and discuss the
wavelength dependence of the predicted signal. Finally, we address a comparison
with other classes of unavoidable CMB spectral distortions and future
observational perspectives. While Comptonization from reionization is dominant
at high frequencies, the free-free signal predicted in the considered models
contributes to the distortion at a level of few (few tens) per cent at
frequencies below about 25 GHz (10 GHz) and represents the main signature below
about 4 GHz. The cosmological signal from the HI 21-cm background is found to
prevail over the free-free distortion in a restricted, model dependent
frequency window between about 0.1 and 0.2 GHz.

realization of condensed matter scenarios via ultra-cold atomic gases in
optical lattices or epitaxial growth of thin films, is opening the gate to
investigate a plethora of unprecedented strongly correlated electron systems.
In a large subclass thereof, a metallic state of layered electrons undergoes an
ordering transition below some temperature into unconventional states of matter
driven by electronic correlations, such as magnetism, superconductivity, or
other Fermi surface instabilities. While this type of phenomena has been a
well-established direction of research in condensed matter for decades, the
variety of today's accessible scenarios pose fundamental new challenges to
describe them. A core complication is the multi-orbital nature of the
low-energy electronic structure of these systems, such as the multi-d orbital
nature of electrons in iron pnictides and transition-metal oxides in general,
but also electronic states of matter on lattices with multiple sites per unit
cell such as the honeycomb or kagome lattice. In this review, we propagate the
functional renormalization group (FRG) as a suited approach to investigate
multi-orbital Fermi surface instabilities. The primary goal of the review is to
describe the FRG in explicit detail and render it accessible to everyone both
at a technical and intuitive level. Summarizing recent progress in the field of
multi-orbital Fermi surface instabilities, we illustrate how the unbiased
fashion by which the FRG treats all kinds of ordering tendencies guarantees an
adequate description of electronic phase diagrams and often allows to obtain
parameter trends of sufficient accuracy to make qualitative predictions for
experiments. This review includes detailed and illustrative illustrations of
magnetism and, in particular, superconductivity for the iron pnictides from the
viewpoint of FRG. Furthermore, it discusses candidate scenarios for topological
bulk singlet superconductivity and exotic particle-hole condensates on
hexagonal lattices such as sodium-doped cobaltates, graphene doped to van Hove
Filling, and the kagome Hubbard model. In total, the FRG promises to be one of
the most versatile and revealing numerical approaches to address unconventional
Fermi surface instabilities in future fields of condensed matter research.

the original model of Haberkorn and its extensions that assume additional
dephasing, we show how a nonlinear master equation may be constructed to

the general case of independently rotating cylinders. The theory is based on
the Navier-Stokes equations in the appropriate (cylinder) geometry. In
particular, we derive the axial and the angular velocity profiles as functions
of distance from the cylinder walls and find that both follow a logarithmic
profile, with downwards-bending curvature corrections, which are more
pronounced for the angular velocity profile as compared to the axial velocity
profile, and which strongly increase with decreasing ratio $\eta$ between inner
and outer cylinder radius. In contrast, the azimuthal velocity does not follow
a log-law. We then compare the angular and azimuthal velocity profiles with the
recently measured profiles in the ultimate state of (very) large Taylor
numbers. Though the {\em qualitative} trends are the same -- down-bending for
large wall distances and (properly shifted and non-dimensionalized) angular
velocity profile $\omega^+(r)$ being closer to a log-law than (properly shifted

Modeling such dark matter systems has been a major focus of astrophysicists,
with much of that effort directed at computational techniques. Not
surprisingly, a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of these
self-gravitating systems still eludes us, since it involves the collective
nonlinear dynamics of many-particle systems interacting via long-range forces
described by the Vlasov equation. As a step towards developing a clearer
picture of collisionless self-gravitating relaxation, we analyze the linearized
dynamics of isolated one-dimensional systems near thermal equilibrium by
expanding their phase space distribution functions f(x,v) in terms of Hermite
functions in the velocity variable, and Legendre functions involving the
position variable. This approach produces a picture of phase-space evolution in
terms of expansion coefficients, rather than spatial and velocity variables. We
obtain equations of motion for the expansion coefficients for both
test-particle distributions and self-gravitating linear perturbations of
thermal equilibrium. N-body simulations of perturbed equilibria are performed
and found to be in excellent agreement with the expansion coefficient approach
over a time duration that depends on the size of the expansion series used.

measures and polarised synchrotron radiation, the Milky Way's magnetic field is
now modelled with an unprecedented level of detail and complexity. We aim to
complement this heuristic approach with a physically motivated, quantitative
Galactic dynamo model -- a model that moreover allows for the evolution of the
system as a whole, instead of just solving the induction equation for a fixed
static disc. Building on the framework of mean-field magnetohydrodynamics and
extending it to the realm of a hybrid evolution, we perform three-dimensional
global simulations of the Galactic disc. Closure coefficients embodying the
mean-field dynamo are calibrated against resolved box simulations of
supernova-driven interstellar turbulence. The emerging dynamo solutions
comprise a mixture of the dominant axisymmetric S0 mode, with even parity, and
a subdominant A0 mode, with odd parity. Notably, such a superposition of modes
creates a strong localised vertical field on one side of the Galactic disc. We
moreover find significant radial pitch angles, which decay with radius --
explained by flaring of the disc. In accordance with previous work, magnetic
instabilities appear to be restricted to the less-stirred outer Galactic disc.
Their main effect is to create strong fields at large radii such that the
radial scale length of the magnetic field increases from 4 kpc (for the case of
a mean-field dynamo alone) to about 10 kpc in the hybrid models. There remain
aspects (e.g., spiral arms, X-shaped halo fields, fluctuating fields) that are
not captured by the current model and that will require further development
towards a fully dynamical evolution. Nevertheless, the work presented
demonstrates that a hybrid modelling of the Galactic dynamo is feasible and can
serve as a foundation for future efforts.

very local scale by nucleation of coherently moving units consisting of just a
handful of particles. These units grow and merge over time, ending up in a
long-range ordered, coherently-moving state. So far, there exists no bottom-up
understanding of how the microscopic dynamics and interactions between the
constituents are related to the system's ordering instability. In this paper,
we study a class of models for propelled colloids allowing an explicit
treatment of the microscopic details of the collision process. Specifically,
the model equations are Newtonian equations of motion with separate force terms
for particles' driving, dissipation and interaction forces. Focusing on dilute
particle systems, we analyze the binary scattering behavior for these models,
and determine-based on the microscopic dynamics-the corresponding
collision-rule, i.e., the mapping of pre-collisional velocities and impact
parameter on post-collisional velocities. By studying binary scattering we also
find that the considered models for active colloids share the same principle
for parallel alignment: the first incoming particle (with respect to the center
of collision) is aligned to the second particle as a result of the encounter.
This behavior is distinctively different to alignment in non-driven dissipative
gases. Moreover, the obtained collision rule lends itself as a starting point
to apply kinetic theory for propelled particle systems in order to determine
the phase boundary to a long-range ordered, coherently-moving state. The
microscopic origin of the collision rule offers the opportunity to
quantitatively scrutinize the predictions of kinetic theory for propelled
particle systems through direct comparison with multi-particle simulations.

interference in neutrinoless double beta decay, when more than one mechanism is
operative. We assume a complete cancellation is at work for $^{136}\rm{Xe}$,
and find its implications on the half-life of other isotopes, such as
$^{76}\rm{Ge}$. For definiteness, we consider the role of light and heavy
sterile neutrinos. In this case, the effective Majorana mass parameter can be
redefined to take into account all contributions and its value gets suppressed.
Hence, larger values of neutrino masses are required for the same half-life.
The canonical light neutrino contribution can not saturate the present limits
of half-lives or the positive claim of observation of neutrinoless double beta
decay, once the stringent bounds from cosmology are taken into account. For the
case of cancellation, where all the sterile neutrinos are heavy, the tension
between the results from neutrinoless double beta decay and cosmology becomes
more severe. We show that the inclusion of light sterile neutrinos in this set
up can resolve this issue. Using the recent results from GERDA, we derive upper
limits on the active-sterile mixing angles and compare it with the case of no
cancellation. The required values of the mixing angles become larger, if a
cancellation is at work. A direct test of destructive interference in
$^{136}\rm{Xe}$ is provided by the observation of this process in other
isotopes and we study in detail the correlation between their half-lives.
Finally, we discuss the model realizations which can accommodate light and
heavy sterile neutrinos and the cancellation. We show that sterile neutrinos of
few hundred MeV or GeV mass range, coming from an Extended seesaw framework or
a further extension, can satisfy the required cancellation.

is found to increase with photon energy. The measured rms pulsed fraction is
~12% and ~17% at ~20 keV and ~50 keV, respectively. We detect a new feature in
the 24--35 keV band pulse profile that is uniquely double-peaked. This feature

on the angle between the rotation and magnetic axes of the neutron star of ~20
degrees and on the angle between the rotation axis and line-of-sight of ~50

the initial stellar mass, metallicity, and rotational profile of the stellar

the Horsehead PDR and its associated dense core. Methods. We performed deep
integrations of several H2CO and CH3OH lines at two positions in the Horsehead,
namely the PDR and dense core, with the IRAM-30m telescope. In addition, we
observed one H2CO higher frequency line with the CSO telescope at both
positions. We determine the H2CO and CH3OH column densities and abundances from
the single-dish observations complemented with IRAM-PdBI high-angular
resolution maps (6"") of both species. We compare the observed abundances with
PDR models including either pure gas-phase chemistry or both gas-phase and
grain surface chemistry. Results. We derive CH3OH abundances relative to total
number of hydrogen atoms of ~1.2e-10 and ~2.3e-10 in the PDR and dense core
positions, respectively. These abundances are similar to the inferred H2CO
abundance in both positions (~2e-10). We find an abundance ratio H2CO/CH3OH of
~2 in the PDR and ~1 in the dense core. Pure gas-phase models cannot reproduce
the observed abundances of either H2CO or CH3OH at the PDR position. Both
species are therefore formed on the surface of dust grains and are subsequently
photodesorbed into the gas-phase at this position. At the dense core, on the
other hand, photodesorption of ices is needed to explain the observed abundance
of CH3OH, while a pure gas-phase model can reproduce the observed H2CO
abundance. The high-resolution observations show that CH3OH is depleted onto
grains at the dense core. CH3OH is thus present in an envelope around this
position, while H2CO is present in both the envelope and the dense core itself.
Conclusions. Photodesorption is an efficient mechanism to release complex
molecules in low FUV-illuminated PDRs, where thermal desorption of ice mantles
is ineffective.

Atomic force microscopy images reveal that the ion induced defects are not
topographic in nature but are related to a significant change in friction. To
create these defects, a minimum charge state is needed. In addition to this
threshold behaviour, the required minimum charge state as well as the defect
diameter show a strong dependency on the kinetic energy of the projectiles.
From the linear dependency of the defect diameter on the projectile velocity we
infer that electronic excitations triggered by the incoming ion in the
above-surface phase play a dominant role for this unexpected defect creation in
graphene.

Second, the effect of a time-dependent hyperfine splitting is investigated and
we put forward a scheme that allows parts of the spectrum to be shifted forward

valuable technique if single x-ray photon wavepackets are to become the

tens of arcsec) are of particular interest to probe intermediate and high
redshift clusters. Observations of the tSZ effect will be carried out with the
millimeter dual-band NIKA2 camera, based on Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs)
to be installed at the IRAM 30-meter telescope in 2015. To demonstrate the
potential of such an instrument, we present tSZ observations with the NIKA
camera prototype, consisting of two arrays of 132 and 224 detectors that
observe at 140 and 240 GHz with a 18.5 and 12.5 arcsec angular resolution,
respectively. The cluster RX J1347.5-1145 was observed simultaneously at 140

atmospheric noise and obtain a map of the cluster at 140 GHz. The efficiency of
this procedure has been characterized through realistic simulations of the
observations. The observed 140 GHz map presents a decrement at the cluster
position consistent with the tSZ nature of the signal. We used this map to
study the pressure distribution of the cluster by fitting a gNFW model to the
data. Subtracting this model from the map, we confirm that RX J1347.5-1145 is
an ongoing merger, which confirms and complements previous tSZ and X-ray
observations. For the first time, we demonstrate the tSZ capability of KID

The laser consists of a ZnCdO/ZnO multiple quantum well with air-holes that

spectra with individually developing features but no variation from shot to
shot. These findings are qualitatively reproduced with a model that exploits
the specifics of a dilute system of weak scatterers and can be interpreted in
terms of a lasing network. Introducing the phase-sensitive node coherence
reveals new aspects of the self-organization of the laser field. Lasing is
carried by connected links between a subset of scatterers, the fields on which
are oscillating coherently in phase. In addition, perturbing feedback with
possibly unfitting phases from frustrated other scatterers is suppressed by
destructive superposition. We believe that our findings are representative at
least for weakly scattering random lasers. A generalization to random laser
with dense and strong scatterers seems to be possible when using a more complex
scattering theory for this case.

transformation which is similar to the Lorentz one written for Euclidean space
with signature $(+,+,+,+)$. The role of the speed of light here plays some
velocity $u$ related to the parameter of deformation, which as we estimate is
many order of magnitude larger than the speed of light $u\simeq 1.2 \times
10^{22} c$. The coordinates of the rest and moving frames of reference for
relativistic particle in the space with GUP satisfy the Lorentz transformation
with some effective speed of light. We estimate that the relative deviation of
this effective speed of light $\tilde c$ from $c$ is ${(\tilde c-c)/ c}\simeq

accretion with a rate of dM/dt(Si) = 1.25E5 g/s must be invoked, because its

easily allow for massive composite resonance states at the natural EW scale,

of an effective Lagrangian that implements the $SU(2)_L\otimes SU(2)_R\to
SU(2)_{L+R}$ pattern of electroweak symmetry breaking. They are computed at the
one-loop level and incorporating the newly discovered Higgs-like boson and
possible spin-1 composite resonances. Imposing a proper ultraviolet behaviour
is crucial and allows us to determine S and T at next-to-leading order in terms
of a few resonance parameters. Electroweak precision data force the vector and
axial-vector states to have masses above the TeV scale and suggest that the
W+W- and ZZ couplings to the Higgs-like scalar should be close to the Standard
Model value. Our findings are generic: they only rely on symmetry principles
and soft requirements on the short-distance properties of the underlying
strongly-coupled theory, which are widely satisfied in more specific scenarios.

just above onset. The velocity is constrained to have either a square or a

observed at onset, with most of the magnetic energy being contained in the
horizontally-averaged component. As the magnetic Reynolds number increases,
small-scale dynamo action becomes possible, reducing the overall growth rate of
the dynamo. For the hexagonal pattern, the breaking of symmetry between up and
down flows results in an effective pumping velocity. For intermediate rotation
rates, this additional effect can prevent the growth of any mean-field dynamo,
so that only a small-scale dynamo is eventually possible at large enough
magnetic Reynolds number. For very large rotation rates, this pumping term
becomes negligible, and the dynamo properties of square and hexagonal patterns
are qualitatively similar. These results hold for both perfectly conducting and
infinite magnetic permeability boundary conditions.

problem since exact inference is generally #P-hard and is most often solved
approximately with sampling-based methods today. This paper proposes an
alternative approach for approximate evaluation of conjunctive queries with
standard relational databases: In our approach, every query is evaluated
entirely in the database engine by evaluating a fixed number of query plans,
each providing an upper bound on the true probability, then taking their
minimum. We provide an algorithm that takes into account important schema
information to enumerate only the minimal necessary plans among all possible
plans. Importantly, this algorithm is a strict generalization of all known
PTIME self-join-free conjunctive queries: A query is in PTIME if and only if
our algorithm returns one single plan. Furthermore, our approach is a
generalization of a family of efficient ranking methods from graphs to
hypergraphs. We also adapt three relational query optimization techniques to
evaluate all necessary plans very fast. We give a detailed experimental
evaluation of our approach and, in the process, provide a new way of thinking
about the value of probabilistic methods over non-probabilistic methods for
ranking query answers. We also note that the techniques developed in this paper
apply immediately to lifted inference from statistical relational models since
lifted inference corresponds to PTIME plans in probabilistic databases.

tend to be either parallel or perpendicular to the mean field directions of the
local ICM. This bimodal distribution is not found in cloud simulations with
super-Alfvenic turbulence, in which the cloud orientations should be random.
ICM magnetic fields that are dynamically important compared to inertial-range
turbulence and self-gravity can readily explain both field-filament
configurations. Previous studies commonly recognize that strong magnetic fields
can guide gravitational contraction and result in filaments perpendicular to
them, but few discuss the fact that magnetic fields can also channel
sub-Alfvenic turbulence to form filaments aligned with them. This strong-field
scenario of cloud formation is also consistent with the constant field strength
observed from ICM to clouds (Crutcher et al. 2010) and is possible to explain
the ""hub-filament"" cloud structure (Myers 2009) and the density threshold of
cloud gravitational contraction (Kainulainen et al. 2009).

always exist. The results represent that the stronger the magnetic field, the
smaller the inclination angle, $ \theta_{0} $ becomes. It means that a
magnetized disk is thinner compared to a non-magnetized disk. According to the
work by \citealt{jw}, we can define three regions. The first one is called
inflow region, which starts from the disk midplane to a certain inclination $
\theta_0 $ where $ v_{r}(\theta_{0}) = 0 $. In this region, the velocity has a
negative value and the accretion material moves toward the central object. The
outflow region, where $ v_{r}(\theta) > 0 $, is placed between $ \theta_{0} $

(Rbz) for the critical magnetic field (Bzc) is first introduced in this paper,
which opens an interesting topic for future research.

separable system in which the vector potential is known. The proposed method
uses a potential definition of active and reactive power, implicitly avoiding
infinite entire space integration and extraction of radiation energy. As a
result, all the used quantities are finite, and the calculated Qz is always
non-negative function of frequency. The theory is presented on the canonical
example of the currents flowing on a spherical shell. The Qz for the dominant
spherical TM and TE mode and their linear combination are found in closed
forms, including both internal and external energies. The proposed analytical
method and its results are compared to previously published limits of the
quality factor Q.

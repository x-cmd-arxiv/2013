ALMA's ongoing Development Program. We describe the new frequency range for
Band 1 of 35-52 GHz, a range chosen to maximize the receiver suite's scientific
impact. We first describe two key science drivers: 1) the evolution of grains
in protoplanetary disks and debris disks, and 2) molecular gas in galaxies
during the era of re-ionization. Studies of these topics with Band 1 receivers
will significantly expand ALMA's Level 1 Science Goals. In addition, we
describe a host of other exciting continuum and line science cases that require
ALMA's high sensitivity and angular resolution. For example, ALMA Band 1
continuum data will probe the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect in galaxy clusters,
Very Small Grains and spinning dust, ionized jets from young stars, spatial and
flaring studies of Sgr A*, the acceleration sites of solar flares, pulsar wind
nebulae, radio supernovae, and X-ray binaries. Furthermore, ALMA Band 1 line
data will probe chemical differentiation in cloud cores, complex carbon chain
molecules, extragalactic radio recombination lines, masers, magnetic fields
through Zeeman effect measurements, molecular outflows from young stars, the
co-evolution of star formation and active galactic nuclei, and the molecular
content of galaxies at z ~ 3. ALMA provides similar to better sensitivities
than the JVLA over 35-50 GHz, with differences increasing with frequency.
ALMA's smaller antennas and shorter baselines, greater number of baselines, and
single-dish capabilities, however, give it a significant edge for observing
extended emission, making wide-field maps (mosaics), or attaining high image
fidelity, as required by the described science cases.

complex numbers with $r>0,$ is said to be realizable if $\lambda$ is the
spectrum of $n\times n$ nonnegative matrix $A$ and in this case $A$ is said to
be a nonnegative realization of $\lambda$. If, in addition, each row and column
sum of $A$ equals $r$, then $\lambda$ is said to be doubly stochastically
realizable and in such case $A$ is said to be a doubly stochastic realization
for $\lambda$. In 1997, Guo proved that if $\left(\lambda_2,\ldots,
\lambda_n\right)$ is any list of complex numbers which is closed under complex
conjugation then there exists a least real number $\lambda_0$ with
$\max\limits_{2\leq j\leq n}|\lambda_j|\leq\lambda_0\leq 2n\max\limits_{2\leq
j\leq n}|\lambda_j|$ such that the list of complex numbers $\{
\lambda_1,\lambda_2,...,\lambda_n\}$ is realizable if and only if
$\lambda_1\geq \lambda_0$. In 2020, Julio and Soto showed that the upper bound
may be reduced to $(n-1)\max\limits_{2\leq j\leq n}|\lambda_j|$ in the case
when at least one of the $\lambda_i$ is real.
  In this paper, we first describe an algorithm for passing from a nonnegative
realization to a doubly stochastic realization. As applications, we give a new
sufficient condition for a stochastic matrix $A$ to be cospectral to a doubly
stochastic matrix $B$ and in this case $B$ is shown to be the unique closest
doubly stochastic matrix to $A$ with respect to the Frobenius norm. Then, our
next results slightly improve the upper bound for the nonnegative realization
presented by Julio and Soto and in the case when none of the $\lambda_i$ is
real, we also give an improvement of Guo's bound. Then, for doubly stochastic
realizations, we obtain an upper bound that improves Guo's bound as well.
Finally, for certain particular cases, we give a further improvement of our
last bound for doubly stochastic realization.

granulates the Gaussian random input into Gaussian subcarrier continuous

sub-channels from the physical link with strongly diverse transmission

Conversely, I show that for all stochastic processes there is a

the stochastic process. Still, one might guess that the measure-theoretic
deterministic systems which are observationally equivalent to stochastic
processes used in science do not include any deterministic systems used in

science even give rise to Bernoulli processes. Despite this, one might guess
that measure-theoretic deterministic systems used in science cannot give the
same predictions at every observation level as stochastic processes used in
science. By proving results in ergodic theory, I show that also this guess is
misguided: there are several deterministic systems used in science which give
the same predictions at every observation level as Markov processes. All these
results show that measure-theoretic deterministic systems and stochastic
processes are observationally equivalent more often than one might perhaps
expect. Furthermore, I criticise the claims of the previous philosophy papers

a He II Gunn-Peterson trough, a sign of incomplete helium reionization at $z >
2.9$. We present its HST/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph far-UV medium-resolution
spectrum, which resolves many spectral features for the first time, allowing
study of the quasar itself, the intergalactic medium, and quasar proximity
effects. Q0302-003 has a harder intrinsic extreme-UV spectral index than
previously claimed, as determined from both a direct fit to the spectrum
(yielding $\alpha_{\nu} = -0.8$) and the helium-to-hydrogen ion ratio in the
quasar's line-of-sight proximity zone. Intergalactic absorption along this
sightline shows that the helium Gunn-Peterson trough is largely black in the
range $2.87 < z < 3.20$, apart from ionization due to local sources, indicating
that helium reionization has not completed at these redshifts. However, we
tentatively report a detection of nonzero flux in the high-redshift trough when
looking at low-density regions, but zero flux in higher-density regions. This
constrains the He II fraction to be a few percent, suggesting helium
reionization has progressed substantially by $z \sim 3.1$. The Gunn-Peterson
trough recovers to a He II Ly$\alpha$ forest at $z < 2.87$. We confirm a
transmission feature due to the ionization zone around a $z = 3.05$ quasar just
off the sightline, and resolve the feature for the first time. We discover a
similar such feature possibly caused by a luminous $z = 3.23$ quasar further
from the sightline, which suggests that this quasar has been luminous for >34
Myr.

excellent 1 dB horizontal loss misalignment ranges of respectively 2.8 um and
3.8 um (worst case over both in-plane axes) have been measured for the two

the even stronger result of observational equivalence at every (and not just

out whether a phenomenon is best modeled as deterministic or indeterministic.
Then one cannot appeal to differences in the probability distributions of
deterministic and indeterministic descriptions found in science to argue that
one of the descriptions is preferable because there is no such difference.
Finally, I criticise the extant claims of philosophers and mathematicians on
observational equivalence.

term syntax covering three different calculi: the pure {\lambda}-calculus, the
calculus with explicit substitutions {\lambda}S, and the calculus with explicit
substitutions, contractions and weakenings {\lambda}lxr. In each of the three
calculi, a term is typable if and only if it is strongly normalising, as it is
the case in (many) systems with idempotent intersections. Non-idempotency
brings extra information into typing trees, such as simple bounds on the
longest reduction sequence reducing a term to its normal form. Strong
normalisation follows, without requiring reducibility techniques. Using this,
we revisit models of the {\lambda}-calculus based on filters of intersection
types, and extend them to {\lambda}S and {\lambda}lxr. Non-idempotency
simplifies a methodology, based on such filter models, that produces modular
proofs of strong normalisation for well-known typing systems (e.g. System F).
We also present a filter model by means of orthogonality techniques, i.e. as an
instance of an abstract notion of orthogonality model formalised in this paper
and inspired by classical realisability. Compared to other instances based on
terms (one of which rephrases a now standard proof of strong normalisation for
the {\lambda}-calculus), the instance based on filters is shown to be better at
proving strong normalisation results for {\lambda}S and {\lambda}lxr. Finally,
the bounds on the longest reduction sequence, read off our typing trees, are
refined into an exact measure, read off a specific typing tree (called
principal); in each of the three calculi, a specific reduction sequence of such
length is identified. In the case of the {\lambda}-calculus, this complexity
result is, for longest reduction sequences, the counterpart of de Carvalho's
result for linear head-reduction sequences.

charged particles multiplicity. The model is based on the Regge-Gribov
approach. Smooth logarithmic growth with the collision energy was established
for the parameter k, the mean rapidity density of charged particles produced by
a single string. It was obtained in the model by the fitting of the available
experimental data on charged particles rapidity density in $pp$ and $p\bar{p}$
collisions. The main effect of the model, a gradual onset of string
collectivity with the growth of collision energy, is accounted by a free
parameter {\beta} that is responsible in an effective way for the string fusion
phenomenon. Another free parameter, t, is used to define string tension. We
extract parameters {\beta} and t from the available experimental results on
<pt>-multiplicity correlation at nucleon collision energy $\sqrt{s}$ from 17
GeV to 7 TeV. Smooth dependence of both {\beta} and t on energy allows to make
predictions for the correlation behavior at the collision energy of 14 TeV. The
indications to the string interaction effects in high multiplicity events in

switch models belong to the most often used models in the electricity
literature. These models try to capture the fluctuations of electricity spot
prices by using different regimes, each with its own mean and covariance
structure. Usually one regime is dedicated to moderate prices and another is
dedicated to high prices. However, these models show poor performance and there
is no theoretical justification for this kind of classification. The merit
order model, the most important micro-economic pricing model for electricity
spot prices, however, suggests a continuum of mean levels with a functional
dependence on electricity demand. We propose a new statistical perspective on
modeling and forecasting electricity spot prices that accounts for the merit
order model. In a first step, the functional relation between electricity spot
prices and electricity demand is modeled by daily price-demand functions. In a
second step, we parameterize the series of daily price-demand functions using a
functional factor model. The power of this new perspective is demonstrated by a
forecast study that compares our functional factor model with two established
classical time series models as well as two alternative functional data models.

in the s and r processes. However, 32 stable, proton-rich isotopes cannot be
formed during those processes, because they are shielded from the s-process
flow and r-process beta-decay chains. These nuclei are attributed to the p and
rp process.
  For all those processes, current research in nuclear astrophysics addresses
the need for more precise reaction data involving radioactive isotopes.
Depending on the particular reaction, direct or inverse kinematics, forward or
time-reversed direction are investigated to determine or at least to constrain
the desired reaction cross sections.
  The Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) will offer unique,
unprecedented opportunities to investigate many of the important reactions. The
high yield of radioactive isotopes, even far away from the valley of stability,
allows the investigation of isotopes involved in processes as exotic as the r

formulation, we optimize constellations in terms of mutual information (MI) for
the effective discrete channel consisting of phase noise, additive white
Gaussian noise, and the approximate ML detector. To this end, we derive the MI

MI for the phase noise channel. We give two analytical characterizations of the
MI of this channel, which are shown to be accurate for a wide range of
signal-to-noise ratios and phase noise variances. For each formulation, we
present a detailed analysis of the optimal constellations and their performance
in the presence of strong phase noise. We show that the optimal constellations
significantly outperform conventional constellations and those proposed in the
literature in terms of SEP, error floors, and MI.

deriving the ML detector. Specifically, we derive an ML detector based on a
Gaussian assumption for the phase error probability density function (PDF).
Further without making any assumptions on the phase error PDF, we show that the
actual ML detector can be reformulated as a weighted sum of central moments of
the phase error PDF. We present a simple approximation of this new ML rule
assuming that the phase error distribution is unknown. The ML detectors derived
are also the aposteriori probabilities of the transmitted symbols, and are

in the study of infectious diseases (e.g., age structure or contact networks).
There are situations where the variability, in terms of epidemiological
parameter, cannot be neatly packaged along with other demographics of the
population like spatial location or life stage. Transport equations are a novel
method for handling this variability via a distributed parameter; where
particular parameter values are possessed by various proportions of the
population. Several authors (e.g., Kareva, Novozhilov, and Katriel) have
studied such systems in a closed population setting (no births/immigrations or
deaths/emigrations), but have cited restrictions to employing such methods when
entry and removal of individuals is added to the population. This paper
details, in the context of a simple susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR)
epidemic, how the method works in the closed population setting and gives
conditions for initial, transient, and asymptotic results to be equivalent with
the nondistributed case. Additionally, I show how the method may be applied to
various forms of open SIR systems. Transport equations are used to transform an
infinite dimensional system for the open population case into a finite
dimensional system which is, at the very least, able to be numerically studied,
a model with direct inheritance of the distributed parameter is shown to be
qualitatively identical to the nondistributed case, and finally a model where
disease results in sterilization is fully analyzed.

  nested restrictions of a database","17, 1 figure",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Lexicographical sorting is a fundamental problem with applications to
contingency tables, databases, Bayesian networks, and more. A standard method
to lexicographically sort general data is to iteratively use a stable sort -- a
sort which preserves existing orders. Here we present a new method of
lexicographical sorting called QuickLexSort. Whereas a stable sort based
lexicographical sorting algorithm operates from the least important to most
important features, in contrast, QuickLexSort sorts from the most important to
least important features, refining the sort as it goes. QuickLexSort first
requires a one-time modest pre-processing step where each feature of the data
set is sorted independently. When lexicographically sorting a database,
QuickLexSort (including pre-processing) has comparable running time to using a
stable sort based approach. For a data base with $m$ rows and $n$ columns, and
a sorting algorithm running in time $O(mlog(m))$, a stable sort based
lexicographical sort and QuickLexSort will both take time $O(nmlog(m))$.
However in many applications one has the need to lexicographically sort nested
data, e.g.\ all possible sub-matrices up to a certain cardinality of columns.
In such cases we show QuickLexSort gives a performance improvement of a log
factor of the database length (rows in matrix) over using a standard stable
sort based approach. E.g.\ to sort all sub-matrices up to cardinality $k$,
QuickLexSort has running time $O(mn^k)$ whereas a stable sort based
lexicographical sort will take time $O(mlog(m)n^k)$. After the pre-processing
step that is run only once for the entire matrix, QuickLexSort has a running
time linear in the number of nested sub-matrices to sort. We conclude with an
application to Bayesian network scoring to detect epistasis using SNP marker
data.

service, offering a wealth of personal and sensitive information with
significant security and privacy implications. Hence, OSNs are also an
important - and popular - subject for research. To perform research based on
real-life evidence, however, researchers may need to access OSN data, such as
texts and files uploaded by users and connections among users. This raises
significant ethical problems. Currently, there are no clear ethical guidelines,
and researchers may end up (unintentionally) performing ethically questionable
research, sometimes even when more ethical research alternatives exist. For
example, several studies have employed `fake identities` to collect data from
OSNs, but fake identities may be used for attacks and are considered a security
issue. Is it legitimate to use fake identities for studying OSNs or for
collecting OSN data for research? We present a taxonomy of the ethical
challenges facing researchers of OSNs and compare different approaches. We

"1310.1653","Henry Lin","Henry Lin","Theoretical Bounds on Mate-Pair Information for Accurate Genome Assembly",,,,,"q-bio.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Over the past two decades, a series of works have aimed at studying the
problem of genome assembly: the process of reconstructing a genome from
sequence reads. An early formulation of the genome assembly problem showed that
genome reconstruction is NP-hard when framed as finding the shortest sequence
that contains all observed reads. Although this original formulation is very
simplistic and does not allow for mate-pair information, subsequent
formulations have also proven to be NP-hard, and/or may not be guaranteed to
return a correct assembly.
  In this paper, we provide an alternate perspective on the genome assembly
problem by showing genome assembly is easy when provided with sufficient
mate-pair information. Moreover, we quantify the number of mate-pair libraries
necessary and sufficient for accurate genome assembly, in terms of the length
of the longest repetitive region within a genome. In our analysis, we consider
an idealized sequencing model where each mate-pair library generates pairs of
error free reads with a fixed and known insert size at each position in the
genome.
  Even in this idealized model, we show that accurate genome reconstruction
cannot be guaranteed in the worst case unless at least roughly R/2L mate-pair
libraries are produced, where R is the length of the longest repetitive region
in the genome and L is the length of each read. On the other hand, if (R/L)+1
mate-pair libraries are provided, then a simple algorithm can be used to find a
correct genome assembly easily in polynomial time. Although (R/L)+1 mate-pair
libraries can be too much to produce in practice, the previous bounds only hold
in the worst case. In our last result, we show that if additional conditions
hold on a genome, a correct assembly can be guaranteed with only O(log (R/L))
mate-pair libraries.

subspace. This problem is a subtask of some approaches to dictionary learning
and sparse principal component analysis. Hence, if we can prove scaling laws
for recovery of sparse vectors, it will be easier to derive and prove recovery
results in these applications. In this paper, we present a scaling law for
recovering the sparse vector from a subspace that is spanned by the sparse
vector and $k$ random vectors. We prove that the sparse vector will be the
output to one of $n$ linear programs with high probability if its support size
$s$ satisfies $s \lesssim n/\sqrt{k \log n}$. The scaling law still holds when
the desired vector is approximately sparse. To get a single estimate for the
sparse vector from the $n$ linear programs, we must select which output is the
sparsest. This selection process can be based on any proxy for sparsity, and
the specific proxy has the potential to improve or worsen the scaling law. If
sparsity is interpreted in an $\ell_1/\ell_\infty$ sense, then the scaling law
can not be better than $s \lesssim n/\sqrt{k}$. Computer simulations show that
selecting the sparsest output in the $\ell_1/\ell_2$ or thresholded-$\ell_0$
senses can lead to a larger parameter range for successful recovery than that
given by the $\ell_1/\ell_\infty$ sense.

devices, it is essential to understand the skyrmion motions in confined
geometries. Here we show by micromagnetic simulations that the current-induced
motion of skyrmions in the presence of geometrical boundaries is very different
from that in an infinite plane. In a channel with finite width, the transverse
confinement results in steady state characteristics of the skyrmion velocity as
a function of current similar to those of domain walls in ferromagnets, whereas
the transient behaviour depends on the initial distance of the skyrmion from
the boundary. In addition, we show that single skyrmions can be created by
electric current in a simple constricted geometry of a plate-shaped specimen of
suitable size and geometry. These findings could guide the design of
skyrmion-based devices, in which skyrmions are used as information carriers.

Meanwhile, at the frustrated momentum $Q_2 = (0,\pi)$, the susceptibility
becomes isotropic in spin space and the magnetic resonance exists for both

distinct scales, which provides a natural explanation for the recently observed
double resonance peaks. In addition, we show that near optimal doping the
existence of strong magnetic fluctuations, which are modeled here via a
Gaussian mode, can still induce the spin anisotropy in the magnetic

in the neutron rms radius, i.e., a larger value in $^{39}$Mg than those in

describe a process of cumulative change in which acquired traits are retained

cannot describe change of state that involves horizontal (Lamarckian) exchange,

magnitude of the wave run-up is largely dependent on the coupling of the
cylinder slenderness, $ka$, and wave steepness, $kA$, parameters. This present
work proposes an analytical solution to the free-surface elevation around a

horizontal extent of the cylinder is much smaller than the incident wavelength

perturbation expansion of the velocity potential and free-surface boundary
condition is invoked and solved to third-order in terms of $ka$ and $kA$. The
validity of this approach is investigated through a comparison with canonical
second-order diffraction theory and existing experimental results. We find that
for small $ka$, the long wavelength theory is valid up to $kA \approx 0.16-0.2$
on the up wave side of the cylinder. However, this domain is significantly
reduced to $kA<0.06$ when an arbitrary position around the cylinder is

the competition between quantum spin Hall edge states and valley edge states in

at one edge of the nanoribbon are suppressed by the counterpropagating edge
modes induced by the pseudomagnetic field. At the opposite edge, the quantum
spin Hall states are not affected at all. Therefore, the degenerate quantum
spin Hall states of opposite spin orientation, which propagate at the two

industry eight years ago, many new vendors now offer a range of alternative
models. Despite this, little crowd work research has explored other platforms.
Such near-exclusive focus risks letting AMT's particular vagaries and
limitations overly shape our understanding of crowd work and the research
questions and directions being pursued. To address this, we present a
cross-platform content analysis of seven crowd work platforms. We begin by
reviewing how AMT assumptions and limitations have influenced prior research.
Next, we formulate key criteria for characterizing and differentiating crowd
work platforms. Our analysis of platforms contrasts them with AMT, informing
both methodology of use and directions for future research. Our cross-platform
analysis represents the only such study by researchers for researchers,
intended to further enrich the diversity of research on crowd work and
accelerate progress.

behavior of strong and classical solutions to the Cauchy problem of the
Navier-Stokes equations for viscous compressible barotropic flows in two or
three spatial dimensions with vacuum as far field density. For strong and
classical solutions, some a priori decay with rates (in large time) for both
the pressure and the spatial gradient of the velocity field are obtained
provided that the initial total energy is suitably {small.} Moreover, by using
these key decay rates and some analysis on the expansion rates of the essential
support of the density, we establish the global existence and uniqueness of
classical solutions (which may be of possibly large oscillations) in two
spatial dimensions, provided the smooth initial data are of small total energy.
In addition, the initial density can even have compact support. This, in
particular, yields the global regularity and uniqueness of the re-normalized
weak solutions of Lions-Feireisl to the two-dimensional compressible barotropic
flows for all adiabatic number $\gamma>1$ provided that the initial total
energy is small.

of humor considered, slippage humor, is defined and contrasted with
aggression-based humor. A variety of slippage humor, based on Hofstadter's
notion of a frame blend, is presented. Given that a frame is a small coherent
cluster of concepts pertaining to a single topic (similar to a script), a frame
blend results when elements extracted from two distinct frames are spliced
together to yield a new hybrid frame. Diverse ways of blending two frames can
produce varying degrees and types of humor. Studies of this phenomenon are
presented. We discuss the connection between frame blends and analogies,
focusing on the Copycat domain: an idealized microworld in which analogy making
can be studied and modeled on computer. It is shown how jokes can be mapped
into that domain, giving rise to a kind of abstract microworld humor. This
highlights the relationships amongst good jokes, defective analogies, and frame
blends. We discuss the notion that many jokes can share the same abstract
structure, and propose the term ur-joke for the most abstract level of a joke.
Several specific ur-jokes are presented, each with a set of fully fleshed-out
jokes based on it. We recount efforts at translating two jokes from one subject
matter to another in an attempt to determine whether a joke's funniness is due
more to its underlying ur-joke or its subject matter. We discuss the
relationship between the Raskin's overlapping-script theory of humor,
Hofstadter's frame-blend theory, and a theory that incorporates multiple-level
analysis of jokes. Finally, a speculative theory about the adaptive value of
humor is presented.

mainstream of broadband access networks. The registration process of EPON,
defined by the IEEE 802.3av standard, is a multi-point control protocol (MPCP)
within the media access control (MAC) layer. As with other contention-based
channel access methods, such as ALOHA and CSMA, stability and delay are
critical issues concerning the performances of implementing the protocol on
systems with finite channel capacity. In this paper, the registration process
of an EPON subscriber, called optical network units (ONUs), is modeled as a
discrete-time Markov chain, from which we derive the fundamental throughput
equation of EPON that characterizes the registration processes. The solutions
of this characteristic equation depend on the maximum waiting time. The aim of
our stability analysis is to pinpoint the region of the maximum waiting time
that can guarantee a stable registration throughput and a bounded registration
delay. For a maximum waiting time selected from the stable region, we obtain
the expression of registration delay experienced by an ONU attempting to
register. All analytic results presented in this paper were verified by

unsupervised methods, followed by spatial pyramid pooling, and linear

Here we propose to use the feature learning pipeline for visual tracking.
Tracking is implemented using tracking-by-detection and the resulted framework
is very simple yet effective. First, online dictionary learning is used to
build a dictionary, which captures the appearance changes of the tracking
target as well as the background changes. Given a test image window, we extract
local image patches from it and each local patch is encoded with respect to the
dictionary. The encoded features are then pooled over a spatial pyramid to form
an aggregated feature vector. Finally, a simple linear classifier is trained on
these features.
  Our experiments show that the proposed powerful---albeit simple---tracker,
outperforms all the state-of-the-art tracking methods that we have tested.
Moreover, we evaluate the performance of different dictionary learning and
feature encoding methods in the proposed tracking framework, and analyse the
impact of each component in the tracking scenario. We also demonstrate the
flexibility of feature learning by plugging it into Hare et al.'s tracking
method. The outcome is, to our knowledge, the best tracker ever reported, which
facilitates the advantages of both feature learning and structured output
prediction.

power grids and the behavior of the aggregation can be captured by a stochastic
battery with dissipation. In this paper, we address two practical issues
associated with the proposed battery model. First, we address clustering of a
heterogeneous collection and show that by finding the optimal dissipation
parameter for a given collection, one can divide these units into few clusters
and improve the overall battery model. Second, we analytically characterize the
impact of imposing a no-short-cycling requirement on TCLs as constraints on the
ramping rate of the regulation signal. We support our theorems by providing
simulation results.

By the partial substitution of La for Sr, superconductivity emerges when x >

there exists a crossover from metallic to semiconducting state below a

impurity, spin correlations cause an exponentially decaying antiferromagnetic
local magnetization in a magnetic field. We develop an effective model for the
local magnetization of systems with many randomly distributed impurities, with
few parameters which can be extracted out of QMC calculations with a single

around an impurity works as an effective field for spins on the neighboring
ladders, causing a non-exponentially decaying magnetization cloud around the
impurity. Our results show that even for impurity concentrations as small as x
= 0.001 and x = 0.0025, the broadening effect is large, in good quantitative
agreement with experiment. We also develop a simple model for the effective

support the propagation of solitary waves (SWs) with only the negative

paradigm for the definition of the partial mobility $\mu_{M}$ associated with a
given elastic scattering mechanism ""M"", taking phonons (PH) as a reference
($\mu_{M}^{-1}=\mu_{PH+M}^{-1}-\mu_{PH}^{-1}$). We argue that this definition
makes better sense in a quantum transport framework as it is free from long
range interference effects that can appear in purely ballistic calculations. As
a matter of fact, these mobilities satisfy Matthiessen's rule for three
mechanisms [surface roughness (SR), remote Coulomb scattering (RCS) and
phonons] much better than the usual, single mechanism calculations. We also
discuss the problems raised by the long range spatial correlations in the RCS
disorder. Finally, we compare semi-classical Kubo-Greenwood (KG) and quantum
NEGF calculations. We show that KG and NEGF are in reasonable agreement for
phonon and RCS, yet not for SR. We point to possible deficiencies in the
treatment of SR scattering in KG, opening the way for further improvements.

different data, is an important problem in various fields. This problem is
especially challenging when large deformations occur. In this paper, we present
a novel algorithm to obtain diffeomorphic image or surface registrations with
large deformations via quasi-conformal maps. The basic idea is to minimize an
energy functional involving a Beltrami coefficient term, which measures the
distortion of the quasi-conformal map. The Beltrami coefficient effectively
controls the bijectivity and smoothness of the registration, even with very
large deformations. Using the proposed algorithm, landmark-based registration
between images or surfaces can be effectively computed. The obtained
registration is guaranteed to be diffeomorphic (1-1 and onto), even with a
large deformation or large number of landmark constraints. The proposed
algorithm can also be combined with matching intensity (such as image intensity
or surface curvature) to improve the accuracy of the registration. Experiments
have been carried out on both synthetic and real data. Results demonstrate the
efficacy of the proposed algorithm to obtain diffeomorphic registration between
images or surfaces.

muons are increasingly being exploited for the non-destructive assay of
shielded containers in a wide range of applications. One such application is
the characterisation of legacy nuclear waste materials stored within industrial
containers. The design, assembly and performance of a prototype muon tomography
system developed for this purpose are detailed in this work. This muon tracker
comprises four detection modules, each containing orthogonal layers of
Saint-Gobain BCF-10 2mm-pitch plastic scintillating fibres. Identification of
the two struck fibres per module allows the reconstruction of the incoming and
Coulomb-scattered muon trajectories. These allow the container content, with
respect to the atomic number Z of the scattering material, to be determined
through reconstruction of the scattering location and magnitude. On each
detection layer, the light emitted by the fibre is detected by a single
Hamamatsu H8500 MAPMT with two fibres coupled to each pixel via dedicated
pairing schemes developed to ensure the identification of the struck fibre. The
PMT signals are read out to QDCs. The design and assembly of the detector
system are detailed and presented alongside results from performance studies
with data collected after construction. These results reveal high stability
during extended collection periods with detection efficiencies in the region of
80% per layer. Minor misalignments of millimetre order have been identified and
corrected in software. A first image reconstructed from a test configuration of
materials has been obtained using software based on the Maximum Likelihood
Expectation Maximisation algorithm. The results highlight the high spatial
resolution provided by the detector system. Clear discrimination between the
low, medium and high-Z materials assayed is also observed.

recent years. For such models, the estimation of parameter sensitivities is an
important and challenging problem. Sensitivity values help in analyzing the
network, understanding its robustness properties and also in identifying the
key reactions for a given outcome. Most of the methods that exist in the
literature for the estimation of parameter sensitivities, rely on Monte Carlo
simulations using Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm or its variants.
It is well-known that such simulation methods can be prohibitively expensive
when the network contains reactions firing at different time-scales, which is a
feature of many important biochemical networks. For such networks, it is often
possible to exploit the time-scale separation and approximately capture the
original dynamics by simulating a ""reduced"" model, which is obtained by
eliminating the fast reactions in a certain way. The aim of this paper is to
tie these model reduction techniques with sensitivity analysis. We prove that
under some conditions, the sensitivity values of the reduced model can be used
to approximately recover the sensitivity values for the original model. Through
an example we illustrate how our result can help in sharply reducing the
computational costs for the estimation of parameter sensitivities for reaction
networks with multiple time-scales. To prove our result, we use coupling
arguments based on the random time change representation of Kurtz. We also
exploit certain connections between the distributions of the occupation times
of Markov chains and multi-dimensional wave equations.

  The goal of this thesis is to predict the polarization of a \tau-particle
produced at the LHC and coming from a real W boson. This is achieved by
calculating the projection of the expectation value of the polarization vector
of the \tau-particle. Calculations are done in the frame of the Standard Model.
In this model only left-chiral currents couple to W bosons. The mass of the
\tau-particle is left non-zero, therefore one can see the influence of helicity
mixing on polarization.
  The initial colliding particles at the LHC are protons and the most important
channels for W production are quark fusion: $q\bar{q} -> W^+ -> \tau^+
\nu_{\tau}$. Calculation for \tau-lepton production from Z bosons and photons,
$q\bar{q} -> Z^0, A^\gamma -> \tau^+ \tau^-$, are also included for
investigation of possible background events. Because quarks are confined in a
proton, this thesis presents a thorough treatment on discribing proton's inner
structure with Parton distribution functions.
  The results section shows plots of differential cross sections for
\tau-lepton production from different quark flavours and different energy
intervals of the \tau-particle. A projection of the expectation value of the
polarization vector depends on the chosen energy intervals. The vector on which
it is projected is chosed to be the direction of the \tau-particle's motion.
The influence of the mass is best seen for low energy particles, because then
the helicity mixing is higher.

a large sample of systems whilst removing any inherent line-of-sight
projections. In order to interpret this ratio as a cross-section of Dark Matter
we derive an analytical description of sub-halo infall which encompasses; the
force of the main cluster potential, the drag on a gas sub-halo, a model for
Dark Matter self-interactions and the resulting sub-halo drag, the force on the
gas and galaxies due to the Dark Matter sub-halo potential, and finally the
buoyancy on the gas and Dark Matter. We create mock observations from
cosmological simulations of structure formation and find that collisionless
Dark Matter becomes physically separated from X-ray gas by up to 20h^-1 kpc.
Adding realistic levels of noise, we are able to predict achievable constraints

difference in the dynamical behaviour of Dark Matter and standard model
particles at 6 sigma, and measure the total interaction cross-section sigma/m

nonnegative cooperativity. In the bad cavity regime we show that the
cooperativity defines the transitions from subradiance to superradiance. In the

distinguishable signatures indicating the lasing regime. Increasing the quality
of the cavity mode induces a crossover from the solely superradiant to the
lasing regime. Furthermore, we verify that lasing is manifested in a wide range
of positive cooperative behavior, showing that stimulated emission and
superradiance can coexist. The robustness of the cooperativity is studied with

fields and global symmetry on the boundary using gauge/gravity. A variational
minimization problem has been formulated. The numerical results pertinently
show that there exists a minimum chemical potential in which both scalar
(s-wave) and vector (p-wave) condensates exist in a mixture, as well as in the
distinct s- and p-phases. This result is obtained by breaking the symmetry into
U(1) symmetry and rotational symmetry. While the analytical solutions of
condensates and charge densities are achieved in both cases: the balanced and
unbalanced holographic superconductors. This is the first an- alytical study of
the coexistence of two modes of the superconductivity with different order
parameters. The realistic model consists of two different phases of the
superfluidity in Helium.

initial ion acoustic speed of the plasma is set to 4.6. This high Mach number
delays the formation of such structures by tens of inverse ion plasma

acoustic instability, which can develop in the 2D simulation but not in the 1D

The oblique ion acoustic waves fragment their electric field. The transition

cells is limited by poor charge transport in the active layer of the device,
which originates from multiple trapping sites provided by QD surface defects.
We apply a recently developed ultrafast electro-optical technique, pump-push
photocurrent spectroscopy, to elucidate the charge trapping dynamics in PbS
colloidal-QD photovoltaic devices at working conditions. We show that IR
photo-induced absorption of QD in the 0.2-0.5 eV region is partly associated
with immobile charges, which can be optically de-trapped in our experiment.
Using this absorption as a probe, we observe that the early trapping dynamics
strongly depend on the nature of the ligands used for QD passivation while it
depends only slightly on the nature of the electron-accepting layer. We find
that weakly bound states, with a photon-activation energy of 0.2 eV, are
populated instantaneously upon photoexcitation. This indicates that the
photogenerated states show an intrinsically bound-state character, arguably
similar to charge-transfer states formation in organic photovoltaic materials.
Sequential population of deeper traps (activation energy 0.3-0.5 eV) is
observed on the ~0.1-10 ns time scales, indicating that most of carrier
trapping occurs only after substantial charge relaxation/transport. The
reported study disentangles fundamentally different contributions to charge
trapping dynamics in the nanocrystal-based optoelectronic devices and can serve
as a useful tool for QD solar cell development.

We aim to explore the similarities/differences between an absorbing, disk-born

of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Using radiative transfer Monte Carlo
simulations, we compute the continuum polarization signatures emerging from the
model setup of Elvis (2000). We find that a dust-filled outflow produces very
low amount of wavelength-depend polarization degrees, associated with a photon
polarization angle perpendicular to the projected symmetry axis of the model.
The polarization percentages are ten times lower than what can be produced by a
toroidal model, with a maximal polarization degree found for intermediate
viewing angle (i.e. when the observer's line-of-sight crosses the outflowing
material). The structure for quasars unsuccessfully blocks the radiation from
the central irradiating source and shows a spectropolarimetric behavior that
cannot be conciliated with observations. Either a new set of morphological
parameters or different optical thickness must be considered.

states, in organic-based photovoltaic devices is one of the dominant loss
mechanisms hindering performance. While CT state dynamics following electron
transfer from donor to acceptor have been widely studied, there is not much
known about the dynamics of bound CT states produced by hole transfer from the
acceptor to the donor. In this letter, we compare the dynamics of CT states
formed in the different charge-transfer pathways in a range of model systems.
We show that the nature and dynamics of the generated CT states are similar in
the case of electron and hole transfer. However the yield of bound and free
charges is observed to be strongly dependent on the HOMOD-HOMOA and LUMOD-LUMOA
energy differences of the material system. We propose a qualitative model in
which the effects of static disorder and sampling of states during the
relaxation determine the probability of accessing CT states favourable for
charge separation.

big market orders impacting the stock price and penalizing the agent, and the
weak one due to small market orders and reducing the probability of a

techniques in this semi-Markov model. In the no risk-aversion case, we provide
explicit formula for the optimal controls and characterize the value function

the value function in terms of the previous result, and illustrate how the risk
aversion influences the trader strategy and her expected gain. Finally, by
using a perturbation method, approximate optimal controls for small risk
aversions are explicitly computed in terms of two simple PDE's, reducing
drastically the computational cost and enlightening the financial

which are right-handed partners of the Standard Model neutrinos. The existence
of such particles is strongly motivated by theory, as they can simultaneously
explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe, account for the pattern of
neutrino masses and oscillations and provide a Dark Matter candidate.
  Cosmological constraints on the properties of HNLs now indicate that the
majority of the interesting parameter space for such particles was beyond the
reach of the previous searches at the PS191, BEBC, CHARM, CCFR and NuTeV
experiments. For HNLs with mass below 2 GeV, the proposed experiment will
improve on the sensitivity of previous searches by four orders of magnitude and
will cover a major fraction of the parameter space favoured by theoretical
models.
  The experiment requires a 400 GeV proton beam from the SPS with a total of
2x10^20 protons on target, achievable within five years of data taking. The
proposed detector will reconstruct exclusive HNL decays and measure the HNL
mass. The apparatus is based on existing technologies and consists of a target,
a hadron absorber, a muon shield, a decay volume and two magnetic
spectrometers, each of which has a 0.5 Tm magnet, a calorimeter and a muon
detector. The detector has a total length of about 100 m with a 5 m diameter.
The complete experimental set-up could be accommodated in CERN's North Area.
  The discovery of a HNL would have a great impact on our understanding of
nature and open a new area for future research.

granular media. The systems considered are confined in narrow
quasi-two-dimensional and quasi-one-dimensional (column) geometries, where the
vertical extension of the container is much larger than both horizontal
lengths. The additional geometric constraint present in the column setup
frustrates the convection state that is normally observed in wider geometries.
This makes it possible to study collective oscillations of the grains with a
characteristic frequency that is much lower than the frequency of energy
injection. The frequency and amplitude of these oscillations are studied as a
function of the energy input parameters and the size of the container. We
observe that, in the quasi-two-dimensional setup, low-frequency oscillations
are present even in the convective regime. This suggests that they may play a
significant role in the transition from a density inverted state to convection.
Two models are also presented; the first one, based on Cauchy's equations, is
able to predict with high accuracy the frequency of the particles' collective
motion. This first principles model requires a single input parameter, i.e, the

the existence of the low-frequency mode is an inverted density profile with
distinct low and high density regions, a condition that may apply to other
systems too. The second, simpler model just assumes an harmonic oscillator like
behaviour and, using thermodynamic arguments, is also able to reproduce the

and the vacuum for an interacting theory belong to different, non-equivalent
representations of the canonical (anti-)commutation relations. In the external
field problem of QED, we encounter this problem in the form that the Dirac time
evolution for an external field with non-vanishing magnetic components will not
satisfy the Shale-Stinespring condition, known to be necessary and sufficient
for the existence of an implementation on the fermionic Fock space. Therefore,
a second quantization of the time evolution in the usual way is impossible. In
this thesis, we present several rigorous approaches to QED with time-dependent,
external fields and analyze in what sense a time evolution can exist in the
second quantized theory. We study different constructions of the fermionic Fock
space and prove their equivalence. We study and compare the results of Deckert
et. al. (2010), where the time evolution is realized as unitary transformations
between time-varying Fock spaces, with those of Langmann and Mickelsson (1996),
who construct a ""renormalization"" for the time evolution and present a method
to fix the phase of the second quantized scattering operator by parallel
transport in a principle fibre bundle over the restricted, general linear group
acting on the fermionic Fock space. We provide rigorous proof for the fact that
the second quantization by parallel transport preserves causality. These
findings seem to refute claims made in Scharf (1995) that the phase of the
second quantized S-matrix is essentially determined by the requirement of
causality. We propose a simple solution to the problem of gauge anomalies in
the procedure of Langmann and Mickelsson, showing that the second quantization
of the scattering operator can be made gauge-invariant by using a suitable
class of renormalizations.

to give us fundamental insight on the conditions required for jet formation in
accreting stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars. This is because particle
acceleration is thought to be magnetically-driven, and the spectral transition
between optically-thin and self-absorbed jet synchrotron radiation lies in the
infrared. We review recent observations from WISE showing that we have the
capability to measure key physical parameters of the jet, and their
time-dependence on rapidly-changing conditions in the accretion flow around the
black hole (on timescales of just a few seconds). SPICA will provide a
breakthrough in this field because of its sensitivity and broadband coverage,

candidates of fluid like matters, we proposed here that there might also exists
certain liquid metal instead of water or methane alone on Mars or the like
planets. Compared with water, such liquid metal would be much easier to stay at
the Mars surface because of its low melting point however extremely high
evaporation point. Along this theoretical route, quite a few observations on

Such hypothesis for the existence of liquid metal on Mars surface does not mean
refuting the possibility of water on Mars. This new point would be helpful for
planning further exploration of Mars in a sense according to the characters of
liquid metal. It at least identifies one more target fluid towards either

the self-affine measures recently considered by Feng and Wang as well as many

  A key application of our results is a \emph{closed form expression} for the

coordinate axes. This is useful for computational purposes and also allows us
to prove differentiability of the $L^q$-spectrum at $q=1$ in the more difficult
`non-multiplicative' situation. This has applications concerning the Hausdorff,
packing and entropy dimension of the measure as well as the Hausdorff and
packing dimension of the support. Due to the possible inclusion of axis
reversing maps, we are led to extend some results of Peres and Solomyak on the
existence of $L^q$-spectrum of self-similar measures to the graph-directed

quasiparticles act as weakly interacting bosons with very light mass, of the
order of $10^{-4}$ times the vacuum electron mass. Many experiments have shown
effects which can be viewed as due to a Bose-Einstein condensate, or
quasicondensate, of these particles. The lifetime of the particles in most of
those experiments has been of the order of a few picoseconds, leading to
significant nonequilibrium effects. By increasing the cavity quality, we have
made new samples with longer polariton lifetimes. With a photon lifetime on the
order of 100-200 ps, polaritons in these new structures can not only come
closer to reaching true thermal equilibrium, a desired feature for many
researchers working in this field, but they can also travel much longer
distances. We observe the polaritons to ballistically travel on the order of
one millimeter, and at higher densities we see transport of a coherent
condensate, or quasicondensate, over comparable distances. In this paper we
report a quantitative analysis of the flow of the polaritons both in a
low-density, classical regime, and in the coherent regime at higher density.
Our analysis gives us a measure of the intrinsic lifetime for photon decay from
the microcavity and a measure of the strength of interactions of the
polaritons.

efficiency for future communication systems. Due to the finer spatial
resolution achieved by a huge number of antennas at the base stations, these
systems have shown to be robust to inter-user interference and the use of
linear precoding is asymptotically optimal. However, most precoding schemes
exhibit high computational complexity as the system dimensions increase. For
example, the near-optimal RZF requires the inversion of a large matrix. This
motivated our companion paper, where we proposed to solve the issue in
single-cell multi-user systems by approximating the matrix inverse by a
truncated polynomial expansion (TPE), where the polynomial coefficients are
optimized to maximize the system performance. We have shown that the proposed
TPE precoding with a small number of coefficients reaches almost the
performance of RZF but never exceeds it. In a realistic multi-cell scenario
involving large-scale multi-user MIMO systems, the optimization of RZF
precoding has thus far not been feasible. This is mainly attributed to the high
complexity of the scenario and the non-linear impact of the necessary
regularizing parameters. On the other hand, the scalar weights in TPE precoding
give hope for possible throughput optimization. Following the same methodology
as in the companion paper, we exploit random matrix theory to derive a
deterministic expression for the asymptotic SINR for each user. We also provide
an optimization algorithm to approximate the weights that maximize the
network-wide weighted max-min fairness. The optimization weights can be used to
mimic the user throughput distribution of RZF precoding. Using simulations, we
compare the network throughput of the TPE precoding with that of the suboptimal
RZF scheme and show that our scheme can achieve higher throughput using a TPE
order of only 3.

the potential to bring tremendous improvements for future communication
systems. Counter-intuitively, the practical issues of having uncertain channel
knowledge, high propagation losses, and implementing optimal non-linear
precoding are solved more-or-less automatically by enlarging system dimensions.
However, the computational precoding complexity grows with the system
dimensions. For example, the close-to-optimal regularized zero-forcing (RZF)
precoding is very complicated to implement in practice, since it requires fast
inversions of large matrices in every coherence period. Motivated by the high
performance of RZF, we propose to replace the matrix inversion by a truncated
polynomial expansion (TPE), thereby obtaining the new TPE precoding scheme
which is more suitable for real-time hardware implementation. The degree of the
matrix polynomial can be adapted to the available hardware resources and
enables smooth transition between simple maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and
more advanced RZF.
  By deriving new random matrix results, we obtain a deterministic expression
for the asymptotic signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) achieved by
TPE precoding in large-scale MIMO systems. Furthermore, we provide a
closed-form expression for the polynomial coefficients that maximizes this
SINR. To maintain a fixed per-user rate loss as compared to RZF, the polynomial
degree does not need to scale with the system, but it should be increased with
the quality of the channel knowledge and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

the maximum amount of energy to sell in a local market so as to maximize a

transitions which are not captured by the Ginzburg-Landau type of
symmetry-breaking order. However, lacking a local order parameter, topological
order is hard to detect. One way to detect is via direct observation of anyonic
properties of excitations which are usually discussed in the thermodynamic
limit, but so far has not been realized in macroscopic quantum Hall samples.
Here we consider a system of few interacting bosons subjected to the lowest
Landau level by a gauge potential, and theoretically investigate vortex
excitations in order to identify topological properties of different ground
states. Our investigation demonstrates that even in surprisingly small systems
anyonic properties are able to characterize the topological order. In addition,
focusing on a system in the Laughlin state, we study the robustness of its
anyonic behavior in the presence of tunable finite-range interactions acting as
a perturbation. A clear signal of a transition to a different state is
reflected by the system's anyonic properties.

Here, we summarise three techniques for directly measuring this loss in situ
and apply them to a high-finesse, near-concentric, 2 m system. Through small
modifications of the cavity's length, we explore optical loss as a function of
beam spot size over the 1-3 mm range. In this regime we find that optical loss
is relatively constant at around 10 ppm per mirror and shows greater dependence
on the positions of the beam spots on the cavity optics than on their size.

symplectic systems on the real line. The Maslov index measures the signed
intersections (with a given reference plane) of a path of Lagrangian planes.
The natural chart parameterization for the Grassmannian of Lagrangian planes is
the space of real symmetric matrices. Linear system evolution induces a Riccati
evolution in the chart. For large order systems this is a practical approach as
the computational complexity is quadratic in the order. The Riccati solutions,
however, also exhibit singularites (which are traversed by changing charts).
Our new results involve characterizing these Riccati singularities and two
trace formulae for the Maslov index as follows. First, we show that the number
of singular eigenvalues of the symmetric chart representation equals the
dimension of intersection with the reference plane. Second, the Cayley map is a
diffeomorphism from the space of real symmetric matrices to the manifold of
unitary symmetric matrices. We show the logarithm of the Cayley map equals the
arctan map (modulo 2i) and its trace measures the angle of the Langrangian
plane to the reference plane. Third, the Riccati flow under the Cayley map
induces a flow in the manifold of unitary symmetric matrices. Using the natural
unitary action on this manifold, we pullback the flow to the unitary Lie
algebra and monitor its trace. This avoids singularities, and is a natural
robust procedure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches by
applying them to a large eigenvalue problem. We also discuss the extension of
the Maslov index to the infinite dimensional case.

transmissions in the presence of imperfect sensing decisions. Two different
transmission schemes, namely sensing-based spectrum sharing (SSS) and
opportunistic spectrum access (OSA), are considered. In both schemes, secondary
users first perform channel sensing, albeit with possible errors. In SSS,
depending on the sensing decisions, they adapt the transmission power level and
coexist with primary users in the channel. On the other hand, in OSA, secondary
users are allowed to transmit only when the primary user activity is not
detected. Initially, for both transmission schemes, general formulations for
the optimal decision rule and error probabilities are provided for arbitrary
modulation schemes under the assumptions that the receiver is equipped with the
sensing decision and perfect knowledge of the channel fading, and the primary
user's received faded signals at the secondary receiver has a Gaussian mixture
distribution. Subsequently, the general approach is specialized to rectangular
quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). More specifically, optimal decision rule
is characterized for rectangular QAM, and closed-form expressions for the
average symbol error probability attained with the optimal detector are derived
under both transmit power and interference constraints. The effects of
imperfect channel sensing decisions, interference from the primary user and its
Gaussian mixture model, and the transmit power and interference constraints on
the error rate performance of cognitive transmissions are analyzed.

the line of sight. With the data presented here, the total number of values of

Assuming that the network topology evolves with time and assuming that the

bursts (GRBs) and in particular, of the relationship between short GRBs and
long GRBs. The first example of a short GRB is described. The coincidental
occurrence of a GRB with a supernova (SN) is explained within the induced
gravitational collapse (IGC) paradigm, following the sequence: 1) an initial
binary system consists of a compact carbon-oxygen (CO) core star and a neutron
star (NS); 2) the CO core explodes as a SN, and part of the SN ejecta accretes
onto the NS which reaches its critical mass and collapses to a black hole (BH)
giving rise to a GRB; 3) a new NS is generated by the SN as a remnant. The
observational consequences of this scenario are outlined.

of unknown redshift belonging to the list of optically selected radio loud BL
Lacs candidates. We explore their spectroscopic properties and the possible
link with gamma ray emission. From the new observations we determine the
redshift of four objects from faint emission lines or from absorption features
of the host galaxy. In three cases we find narrow intervening absorptions from
which a lower limit to the redshift is inferred. For the remaining two
featureless sources, lower limits to the redshift are deduced from the very
absence of spectral lines. A search for gamma counterpart emission shows that
six out of nine are Fermi gamma-ray emitters with two new detections. Our
analysis suggests that most of the BL Lac still lacking of redshift information
are most probably located at high redshift.

about these tori is that they are topologically trivial in the sense that each

stably ribbon surfaces in 4-manifolds that are not ribbon.

surface depends on the short-distance regularization. Quantum gravity should
not require such regularization, and it's been conjectured that the
entanglement entropy there is always given by the black hole entropy formula
evaluated on the entangling surface. We show that these statements have precise
classical counterparts at the level of the action. Specifically, we point out
that the action can have a non-additive imaginary part. In gravity, the latter
is fixed by the black hole entropy formula, while in non-gravitating theories,
it is arbitrary. From these classical facts, the entanglement entropy
conjecture follows by heuristically applying the relation between actions and
wavefunctions.

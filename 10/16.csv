intersecting domain-wall brane model in 5+1-dimensional Minkowskian spacetime
recently proposed by the authors. This new application of the Dvali-Shifman
idea is designed for localizing gauge fields on a domain-wall intersection and
we employ it by adding a gauge group $G$ and giving the scalar fields which
form lump-like profiles gauge charges. These fields in turn break $G$ to two
different subgroups $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$ on each domain wall, and the gauge
fields of these subgroups are taken to be localized to the respective walls by
the confinement dynamics of $G$. There is then a further breaking on the
domain-wall intersection to $H_{1}\cap{}H_{2}$ and gauge fields of this overlap
group can then be localized to the intersection if they belong inside
non-Abelian subgroups of both $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$ which are spontaneously
broken on the intersection and confining in the 4+1D bulks of the respective
domain-wall branes. This mechanism has some similarities to the
Clash-of-Symmetries mechanism on a single domain wall except that in this case
$H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$ need not be isomorphic. We then give some interesting
examples of the mechanism in an SU(7) gauge theory, several of which result in
the localization of the Standard Model gauge group.

the impact of such competition on user welfare. In our model, search providers
compete for customers by strategically selecting which search results to
display in response to user queries. Customers, in turn, have private
preferences over search results and will tend to use search engines that are
more likely to display pages satisfying their demands.
  Our main question is whether competition between search engines increases the
overall welfare of the users (i.e., the likelihood that a user finds a page of
interest). When search engines derive utility only from customers to whom they
show relevant results, we show that they differentiate their results, and every
equilibrium of the resulting game achieves at least half of the welfare that
could be obtained by a social planner. This bound also applies whenever the
likelihood of selecting a given engine is a convex function of the probability
that a user's demand will be satisfied, which includes natural Markovian models
of user behavior.
  On the other hand, when search engines derive utility from all customers
(independent of search result relevance) and the customer demand functions are
not convex, there are instances in which the (unique) equilibrium involves no
differentiation between engines and a high degree of randomness in search
results. This can degrade social welfare by a factor of the square root of N
relative to the social optimum, where N is the number of webpages. These bad
equilibria persist even when search engines can extract only small (but
non-zero) expected revenue from dissatisfied users, and much higher revenue
from satisfied ones.

dissolution in the nematic LC the right-handed chiral dopant 7-DHC

tachysterol under the action of UV irradiation at the wavelength of 254 nm. By
using the model of photoreaction kinetics we obtain dependencies of isomers

cholesteric pitch was measured as a function of irradiation time using the
polarimetry method. In this method, the pitch is estimated from the
experimental data on the irradiation time dependence of the ellipticity of
light transmitted through the LC cells. It is found that the resulting

extend this framework towards other behavioural equivalences, by considering
semirings of weights. Taking advantage of this extra structure, we introduce a
general notion of weak weighted bisimulation. We show that weak weighted
bisimulation coincides with the usual weak bisimulations in the cases of
non-deterministic and fully-probabilistic systems; moreover, it naturally
provides a definition of weak bisimulation also for kinds of LTSs where this

different from other AGNs in being powered by slim accretion disks and showing
saturated accretion luminosities, but both are not yet fully understood. The
results are part of a large reverberation mapping (RM) campaign using the 2.4-m
Shangri-La telescope at the Yunnan Observatory in China. The goals are to
investigate the gas distribution near the BH and the properties of the central
accretion disks, to measure BH mass and Eddington ratios, and to test the
feasibility of using such objects as a new type of cosmological candles. The
paper presents results for three objects, Mrk 335, Mrk 142 and IRAS F12397+3333
with H$\beta$ time lags relative to the 5100\AA\ continuum of
$10.6^{+1.7}_{-2.9}$, $6.4^{+0.8}_{-2.2}$ and $11.4^{+2.9}_{-1.9}$ days,
respectively. The corresponding BH masses are $(8.3_{-3.2}^{+2.6})\times
10^6M_{\odot}$, $(3.4_{-1.2}^{+0.5})\times 10^6M_{\odot}$ and
$(7.5_{-4.1}^{+4.3})\times 10^6M_{\odot}$, and the lower limits on the
Eddington ratios 0.6, 2.3, and 4.6 for the minimal radiative efficiency of
0.038. Mrk 142 and IRAS F12397+333 (extinction corrected) clearly deviate from
the currently known relation between H$\beta$ lag and continuum luminosity. The
three Eddington ratios are beyond the values expected in thin accretion disks
and two of them are the largest measured so far among objects with RM-based BH
masses. We briefly discuss implications for slim disks, BH growth and
cosmology.

in incomplete Si-burning regions, and depends on several nucleosynthesis
environment conditions, such as mass cut beween the matter ejected and falling
back onto the remnant, electron and neutron excesses, mixing fallback, and
explosion energy. Manganese is also produced in type Ia SNe. The aim of this
work is the study of abundances of the iron-peak element Mn in 56 bulge giants,
among which 13 are red clump stars. Four bulge fields along the minor axis are
inspected. The study of abundances of Mn-over-Fe as a function of metallicity
in the Galactic bulge may shed light on its production mechanisms.
High-resolution spectra were obtained using the FLAMES+UVES spectrograph on the
Very Large Telescope. The spectra were obtained within a program to observe 800
stars using the GIRAFFE spectrograph, together with the present UVES spectra.
We aim at identifying the chemical evolution of manganese, as a function of
metallicity, in the Galactic bulge. We find [Mn/Fe] ~-0.7 at [Fe/H]~-1.3,
increasing to a solar value at metallicities close to solar, and showing a
spread around -0.7<[Fe/H]<-0.2, in good agreement with other work on Mn in
bulge stars. There is also good agreement with chemical evolution models. We
find no clear difference in the behaviour of the four bulge fields. Whereas
[Mn/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] could be identified with the behaviour of the thick disc
stars, [Mn/O] vs. [O/H] has a behaviour running parallel, at higher
metallicities, compared to thick disc stars, indicating that the bulge
enrichment might have proceeded differently from that of the thick disk.

Previously parallel repetition with an exponential decay in $k$ was only known
for the case of XOR and unique games. To prove the theorem we extend an
analytical framework recently introduced by Dinur and Steurer for the study of
the classical value of projection games under parallel repetition. Our proof,
as theirs, relies on the introduction of a simple relaxation of the entangled
value that is perfectly multiplicative. The main technical component of the
proof consists in showing that the relaxed value remains tightly connected to
the entangled value, thereby establishing the parallel repetition theorem. More
generally, we obtain results on the behavior of the entangled value under
products of arbitrary (not necessarily identical) projection games. Relating
our relaxed value to the entangled value is done by giving an algorithm for
converting a relaxed variant of quantum strategies that we call ""vector quantum
strategy"" to a quantum strategy. The algorithm is considerably simpler in case
the bipartite distribution of questions in the game has good expansion
properties. When this is not the case, rounding relies on a quantum analogue of
Holenstein's correlated sampling lemma which may be of independent interest.
Our ""quantum correlated sampling lemma"" generalizes results of van Dam and
Hayden on universal embezzlement.

case of TNS, and have become the most precise tool for the numerical study of
one dimensional quantum many-body systems, as the basis of the Density Matrix
Renormalization Group method. Lattice Gauge Theories (LGT), in their
Hamiltonian version, offer a challenging scenario for these techniques. While
the dimensions and sizes of the systems amenable to TNS studies are still far
from those achievable by 4-dimensional LGT tools, Tensor Networks can be
readily used for problems which more standard techniques, such as Markov chain
Monte Carlo simulations, cannot easily tackle. Examples of such problems are
the presence of a chemical potential or out-of-equilibrium dynamics. We have
explored the performance of Matrix Product States in the case of the Schwinger
model, as a widely used testbench for lattice techniques. Using finite-size,
open boundary MPS, we are able to determine the low energy states of the model
in a fully non-perturbative manner and to accurately extract the mass spectrum.
In this work we extend the analysis to the determination of the chiral
condensate, both for massless and massive fermions. The method allows for
accurate finite size and continuum limit extrapolations and produces remarkably
precise results, thus showing the feasibility of these techniques for gauge

includes classical and quantum theories. It is described by a cone $C$ and its
dual $C^*$. We show that whether some one-way communication complexity problems
can be solved within a GPT is equivalent to the recently introduced cone
factorisation of the corresponding communication matrix $M$. We also prove an
analogue of Holevo's theorem: when the cone $C$ is contained in
$\mathbb{R}^{n}$, the classical capacity of the channel realised by sending GPT
states and measuring them is bounded by $\log n$.
  Polytopes and optimising functions over polytopes arise in many areas of
discrete mathematics. A conic extension of a polytope is the intersection of a
cone $C$ with an affine subspace whose projection onto the original space
yields the desired polytope. Extensions of polytopes can sometimes be much
simpler geometric objects than the polytope itself. The existence of a conic
extension of a polytope is equivalent to that of a cone factorisation of the
slack matrix of the polytope, on the same cone.
  We show that all $0/1$ polytopes whose vertices can be recognized by a
polynomial size circuit, which includes as a special case the travelling
salesman polytope and many other polytopes from combinatorial optimisation,
have small conic extension complexity when the cone is the completely positive
cone.
  Using recent exponential lower bounds on the linear extension complexity of
polytopes, this provides an exponential gap between the communication
complexity of GPT based on the completely positive cone and classical
communication complexity, and a conjectured exponential gap with quantum
communication complexity.
  Our work thus relates the communication complexity of generalisations of
quantum theory to questions of mainstream interest in the area of combinatorial
optimisation.

overwhelming volume of data, while keeping low response times. Thus,
scalability is imperative for similarity search in Web-scale applications, but
most existing methods are sequential and target shared-memory machines. Here we
address these issues with a distributed, efficient, and scalable index based on
Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH). LSH is one of the most efficient and popular
techniques for similarity search, but its poor referential locality properties
has made its implementation a challenging problem. Our solution is based on a
widely asynchronous dataflow parallelization with a number of optimizations
that include a hierarchical parallelization to decouple indexing and data
storage, locality-aware data partition strategies to reduce message passing,
and multi-probing to limit memory usage. The proposed parallelization attained
an efficiency of 90% in a distributed system with about 800 CPU cores. In
particular, the original locality-aware data partition reduced the number of
messages exchanged in 30%. Our parallel LSH was evaluated using the largest
public dataset for similarity search (to the best of our knowledge) with $10^9$
128-d SIFT descriptors extracted from Web images. This is two orders of
magnitude larger than datasets that previous LSH parallelizations could handle.

Constant Mean Curvature foliation) in the space-time of a spherically

observer inside 3/4 of the Schwarzschild radius cannot send a signal outside,

black holes at their centres, are the relics of a period in cosmic history when
galaxies formed stars at remarkable rates and active galactic nuclei (AGN)
shone brightly from accretion onto black holes. It is widely suspected, but
unproven, that the tight correlation in mass of the black hole and stellar
components results from the AGN quenching the surrounding star formation as it
approaches its peak luminosity. X-rays trace emission from AGN unambiguously,
while powerful star-forming galaxies are usually dust-obscured and are
brightest at infrared to submillimetre wavelengths. Here we report observations
in the submillimetre and X-ray which show that rapid star formation was common
in the host galaxies of AGN when the Universe was 2-6 Gyrs old, but that the
most vigorous star formation is not observed around black holes above an X-ray
luminosity of 10^44 erg/s. This suppression of star formation in the host
galaxies of powerful AGN is a key prediction of models in which the AGN drives
a powerful outflow, expelling the interstellar medium of its host galaxy and
transforming the galaxy's properties in a brief period of cosmic time.

optical lattices and show how few-body physics can be used to simulate
many-body phenomena, e.g., an electron-phonon system. We take one atomic
species to be trapped in a deep optical lattice at full filling and another to
be untrapped spin-polarized fermions (which do not see the optical lattice) but
has an s-wave contact interaction with the first species. For large positive
scattering length on the order of lattice spacing, the usual two-body bound
(dimer) states overlap forming giant orbitals extending over the entire
lattice, which can be viewed as an ""electronic"" band for the untrapped species
while the trapped atoms become the ""ions"" with their own on-site dynamics,
thereby simulating an electron-phonon system with renormalization of the phonon
frequencies and Peierls transitions. This setup requires large scattering
lengths but minimises losses, does not need higher bands and adds new degrees
of freedom which cannot easily be described in terms of lattice variables, thus
opening up intriguing possibilities to explore interesting physics at the
interface between few-body and many-body systems.

suitable modification of an ""Eulerian decoupling cycle,"" that would otherwise
implement a trivial (zero) target Hamiltonian. For an open quantum system
coupled to an uncontrollable environment, our approach may be employed to
engineer an effective evolution that simulates a target Hamiltonian on the

illustrative applications to both closed- and open-system simulation settings,
with emphasis on simulation of non-local (two-body) Hamiltonians using only
local (one-body) controls. In particular, we provide simulation schemes
applicable to Heisenberg-coupled spin chains exposed to general linear
decoherence, and show how to simulate Kitaev's honeycomb lattice Hamiltonian
starting from Ising-coupled qubits, as potentially relevant to the dynamical
generation of a topologically protected quantum memory. Additional implications

position and environment across the disk of M33 at a linear resolution of 160
pc using Spitzer and Herschel photometric data. Expressing the emissivity of
the dust as a power law, the power-law exponent (beta) is estimated from two
independent approaches designed to properly treat the degeneracy between beta
and the dust temperature. Both beta and the dust temperature are higher in the
inner disk than in the outer disk, contrary to reported beta-T
anti-correlations found in other sources. In the cold + warm dust model, the
warm component and the ionized gas (Halpha) have a very similar distribution
across the galaxy, demonstrating that the model separates the components in an
appropriate fashion. The flocculent spiral arms and the dust lanes are evident
in the map of the cold component. Both cold and warm dust column densities are
high in star forming regions and reach their maxima toward the giant star
forming complexes NGC604 and NGC595. beta declines from close to 2 in the
center to about 1.3 in the outer disk. beta is positively correlated with star
formation and with molecular gas column, as traced by Halpha and CO emission.
The lower dust emissivity index in the outer parts of M33 is likely related to
the reduced metallicity (different grain composition) and possibly different
size distribution. It is not due to the decrease in stellar radiation field or
temperature in a simple way because the FIR-bright regions in the outer disk
also have a low beta. Like most spirals, M33 has a (decreasing) radial gradient
in star formation and molecular-to-atomic gas ratio such that the regions
bright in Halpha or CO tend to trace the inner disk, making it difficult to
distinguish between their effects on the dust.

recently few direct dust measurements have been possible. We investigate dust
in distant star-forming galaxies using near-infrared grism spectra of the
3D-HST survey combined with archival multi-wavelength photometry. These data
allow us to make a direct comparison between dust around star-forming regions
($A_{V,\mathrm{HII}}$) and the integrated dust content ($A_{V,\mathrm{star}}$).
We select a sample of 163 galaxies between $1.36\le{}z\le1.5$ with H$\alpha$
signal-to-noise ratio $\ge5$ and measure Balmer decrements from stacked spectra
to calculate $A_{V,\mathrm{HII}}$. First, we stack spectra in bins of
$A_{V,\mathrm{star}}$, and find that
$A_{V,\mathrm{HII}}=1.86\,A_{V,\mathrm{star}}$, with a significance of
$\sigma=1.7$. Our result is consistent with the two-component dust model, in
which galaxies contain both diffuse and stellar birth cloud dust. Next, we
stack spectra in bins of specific star formation rate ($\log\,\mathrm{SSFR}$),
star formation rate ($\log\,\mathrm{SFR}$), and stellar mass ($\log{}M_*$). We
find that on average $A_{V,\mathrm{HII}}$ increases with SFR and mass, but
decreases with increasing SSFR. Interestingly, the data hint that the amount of
extra attenuation decreases with increasing SSFR. This trend is expected from
the two-component model, as the extra attenuation will increase once older
stars outside the star-forming regions become more dominant in the galaxy
spectrum. Finally, using Balmer decrements we derive dust-corrected H$\alpha$
SFRs, and find that stellar population modeling produces incorrect SFRs if
rapidly declining star formation histories are included in the explored

agreement with the observations. The HI density is predicted to be always
dominated by galaxies with SFR<1Msun/yr. This contrasts with the H2 density,
which is predicted to be dominated by galaxies with SFR>10Msun/yr. Current
high-redshift galaxy surveys are limited to detect carbon monoxide in galaxies
with SFR>30Msun/yr, which in our model make up, at most, 20% of the H2 in the
universe. In terms of stellar mass, the predicted H2 density is dominated by
massive galaxies, Mstellar>10^10Msun, while the HI density is dominated by low
mass galaxies, Mstellar<10^9Msun. In the context of upcoming neutral gas
surveys, we suggest that the faint nature of the galaxies dominating the HI
content of the Universe will hamper the identification of optical counterparts,

Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to fit an appropriate toy model to these

exponential, and cored power-law, respectively, and the LFs are modeled as
broken power-laws. We present probability distributions for each of 32
parameters describing the SB profiles and LFs of the three subcomponents. We
find that the number of stars with a disk-like LF is ~5% larger than the the
number with disk-like (dynamically cold) kinematics, suggesting that some stars
born in the disk have been dynamically heated to the point that they are
kinematically indistinguishable from halo members. This is the first
kinematical evidence for a ""kicked-up disk"" halo population in M31. The
fraction of kicked-up disk stars is consistent with that found in simulations.
We also find evidence for a radially varying disk LF, consistent with a
negative metallicity gradient in the stellar disk.

companion to the Sun-like star GJ 504 using Subaru/HiCIAO within the SEEDS

planets, and has indications of fewer clouds, which implies that it represents
a new class of planetary atmospheres with expected similarities to late T-type
brown dwarfs in the same temperature range. If so, one might also expect the
presence of significant methane absorption, which is characteristic of such
objects. Here, we report the detection of deep methane absorption in the

cosmic microwave background with the source of the peculiar motion still
uncertain. While in the past this has been studied mostly using galaxies as
distance indicators, the weight of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) has increased
recently with the continuously improving statistics of available low-redshift
supernovae.
  Aims. We measured the bulk flow in the nearby universe ($0.015 < z < 0.1$)
using 117 SNe Ia observed by the Nearby Supernova Factory, as well as the
Union2 compilation of SN Ia data already in the literature.
  Methods. The bulk flow velocity was determined from SN data binned in
redshift shells by including a coherent motion (dipole) in a cosmological fit.
Additionally, a method of spatially smoothing the Hubble residuals was used to
verify the results of the dipole fit. To constrain the location and mass of a
potential mass concentration (e.g., the Shapley supercluster) responsible for
the peculiar motion, we fit a Hubble law modified by adding an additional mass
concentration.
  Results. The analysis shows a bulk flow that is consistent with the direction
of the CMB dipole up to $z \sim 0.06$, thereby doubling the volume over which
conventional distance measures are sensitive to a bulk flow. We see no
significant turnover behind the center of the Shapley supercluster. A simple
attractor model in the proximity of the Shapley supercluster is only marginally
consistent with our data, suggesting the need for another, more distant source.
In the redshift shell $0.06 < z < 0.1$, we constrain the bulk flow velocity to
$< 240~\textrm{km s}^{-1}$ (68% confidence level) for the direction of the CMB
dipole, in contradiction to recent claims of the existence of a large-amplitude
dark flow.

conditions between these anomalies yield a number of general relations which

perturbation theory to study field theories in the vicinity of a fixed point

We relate various anomaly coefficients to OPE coefficients at the fixed point

flow. Finally, we illustrate our findings by three explicit models constructed
as current-current perturbations of SU(2)_k WZW model. At each generality level
we discuss the geometric picture behind redundancy and how one can reduce the
number of couplings by taking a quotient with respect to the redundant
directions. We point to the special role of polar representations for the

Density Functional Theory to study properties of Ar, He, and H interstitials in
B2 austenite and B19' martensite phases. We show that H interstitials exhibit
negative formation energies, while Ar and He interstitials yield positive
values. Our theoretical analysis of slightly Ni-rich Ni--Ti alloys with the
austenite B2 structure shows that a slight over-stoichiometry towards Ni-rich
compositions in a range 51--$52\,\text{at.%}$ is energetically favorable. The
same conclusion holds for H-doped NiTi with the H content up to
$\approx6\,\text{at.%}$. In agreement with experimental data we predict H atoms
to have a strong impact on the martensitic phase transformation in NiTi by
altering the mutual thermodynamic stability of the high-temperature cubic B2
and the low-temperature monoclinic B19' phase of NiTi. Hydrogen atoms are
predicted to form stable interstitial defects. As this is not the case for He

Lyrae star showing an irregular Blazhko effect. With a pulsation period of
0.50208 day, the times of light curve maxima are delayed by 6 minutes per day.
This daily delay regularly leads to long periods of time without maximum light
curve observations for a given site. To cope with this observing time window
problem, we have organized a multi-longitude observation campaign including a
telescope of the AAVSONet. From the observed light curves, 92 pulsation maxima
have been measured covering about six Blazhko periods. The Fourier analysis of
magnitudes at maximum light has revealed a main Blazhko period of 77.6 days and
also a secondary period of 40.5 days. A Fourier analysis of (O-C) values did
not show the secondary Blazhko period. The frequency spectrum of the complete
light curve, from a Fourier analysis and successive pre-whitening with
PERIOD04, has shown triplet structures around the two Blazhko modulation
frequencies but with slightly different periods (77.8 and 42.4 days). The
second Blazhko frequency is statistically not a harmonic of the main Blazhko
frequency. Besides the two Blazhko modulations KV Cnc presents other
particularities like irregularities from Blazhko cycle to cycle and very fast
magnitude variations which can reach a maximum of 2.5 magnitudes per hour over
a period of 15 minutes. This campaign shows that regular observations by
amateur astronomers remain important. Indeed such a detailed characterization
of the Blazhko effect could not be obtained from large-scale surveys, as
cooperative long time-series observations are needed.

intermittent avalanches with powerlaw-like size distributions. We develop here
a macroscopic description of SOC systems that provides an equivalent
description of the complex microscopic fine structure, in terms of
fractal-diffusive transport (FD-SOC). Quantitative values for the size
distributions of SOC parameters (length scales $L$, time scales $T$, waiting
times $\Delta t$, fluxes $F$, and energies $E$) are derived from first
principles, using the scale-free probability conjecture, $N(L) dL \propto
L^{-d}$, for Euclidean space dimension $d$. We apply this model to
astrophysical SOC systems, such as lunar craters, the asteroid belt, Saturn
ring particles, magnetospheric substorms, radiation belt electrons, solar
flares, stellar flares, pulsar glitches, soft gamma-ray repeaters, black-hole
objects, blazars, and cosmic rays. The FD-SOC model predicts correctly the size
distributions of 8 out of these 12 astrophysical phenomena, and indicates
non-standard scaling laws and measurement biases for the others.

transition(RFOT) theory, in which relaxation occurs via activated
reconfigurations between distinct, aperiodic minima of the free energy. Two
different approximations for the mismatch penalty between the distinct
aperiodic states are compared, one due to Xia and Wolynes, which scales
universally with temperature as for hard spheres, and one due to Rabochiy and
Lubchenko, which employs measured elastic and structural data for individual
substances. The agreement between the predictions and experiment is
satisfactory, given the uncertainty in the measured experimental inputs. The
explicitly computed barriers are used to calculate the glass transition
temperature for each substance---a kinetic quantity---from the static input
data alone. The temperature dependence of both the elastic and structural
constants enters the temperature dependence of the barrier over an extended
range to a degree that varies from substance to substance. The lowering of the
configurational entropy, however, seems to be the dominant contributor to the
barrier increase near the laboratory glass transition, consistent with previous
experimental tests of the RFOT theory using the XW approximation. In addition,
we compute the temperature dependence of the dynamical correlation length, also
without using adjustable parameters. These agree well with experimental
estimates obtained using the Berthier et al. procedure. Finally, we find the
temperature dependence of the complexity of a rearranging region is consistent
with the picture based on the RFOT theory but is in conflict with the
assumptions of the Adam-Gibbs and ""shoving"" scenarios for the viscous slowing

identify it as a Fe II type of nova, consistent with the same classification

the temperatures of the dust shell on different epochs have been estimated.
Dust formation in V476 Sct is consistent with the presence of lines of elements

a quasi-periodic solution if $\theta$ is not commensurable with $\pi$. In the

not impose any symmetry constraint on solutions. Instead, we prove that our
solutions extended from the initial minimizing pathes have the symmetries.

trajectories that are either permanently erratic or transiently influenced by
permanently erratic ones lying on a set of measure zero. The latter gives rise
to the final state sensitivity observed in connection with fractal basin
boundaries in conservative scattering systems and driven dissipative systems.
Here we focus on the most prevalent case of undriven dissipative systems, whose
transient dynamics fall outside the scope of previous studies since no
time-dependent solutions can exist for asymptotically long times. We show that
such systems can exhibit positive finite-time Lyapunov exponents and
fractal-like basin boundaries which nevertheless have codimension one. In sharp
contrast with its driven and conservative counterparts, the settling rate to
the (fixed-point) attractors grows exponentially in time, meaning that the
fraction of trajectories away from the attractors decays super-exponentially.
While no invariant chaotic sets exist in such cases, the irregular behavior is
governed by transient interactions with transient chaotic saddles, which act as
effective, time-varying chaotic sets.

we find that a significant fraction of the energy is concentrated in modes with
wave frequency $\omega \approx 0$, even when the external forcing injects no
energy directly into these modes. However, for modes for which the period of
the inertial waves $\tau_\omega$ is faster than the turnover time

spatial sensor locations that optimally inform a categorical decision. The
algorithm solves an l1-minimization to find the fewest entries of the full

subsequent test samples are classified with remarkable efficiency, achieving
performance comparable to that obtained by discrimination using the full image.
Sensor locations may be learned from full images, or from a random subsample of
pixels. For classification between more than two categories, we introduce a
coupling parameter whose value tunes the number of sensors selected, trading
accuracy for economy. We demonstrate the algorithm on example datasets from

  multialternative detection tasks","48 pages, 8 figures",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Studies investigating the neural bases of cognitive phenomena such as
perception, attention and decision-making increasingly employ multialternative
task designs. It is essential in such designs to distinguish the neural
correlates of behavioral choices arising from changes in perceptual factors,
such as enhanced sensitivity to sensory information, from those arising from
changes in decisional factors, such as a stronger bias for a particular
response or choice (choice bias). To date such a distinction is not possible
with established approaches. Thus, there is a critical need for a theoretical
approach that distinguishes the effects of changes in sensitivity from those of
changes in choice bias in multialternative tasks. Here, we introduce a
mathematical model that decouples choice bias from perceptual sensitivity
effects in multialternative detection tasks: multialternative tasks that
incorporate catch trials to measure the ability to detect one among multiple
(potential) stimuli or stimulus features. By formulating the perceptual
decision in a novel, multidimensional signal detection framework, our model
identifies the distinct effects of bias and sensitivity on behavioral choices.
With a combination of analytical and numerical approaches, we demonstrate that
model parameters (sensitivity, bias) are estimated reliably and uniquely, even
in tasks involving arbitrarily large numbers of alternatives. Model simulations
revealed that ignoring choice bias or performance during catch trials produced
systematically inaccurate estimates of perceptual sensitivity, a finding that
has important implications for interpreting behavioral data in multialternative
detection and cued attention tasks. The model will find important application
in identifying the effects of neural perturbations (stimulation or
inactivation) on an animal's perception in multialternative attention and
decision-making tasks.

the Poiseuille-type flow in its convergence toward analytic solutions found
earlier in rigid converging-diverging tubes. We also tested the method on

the numerical solutions converged to the expected analytical solutions. The
distensible model has also been endorsed by its convergence toward the rigid
Poiseuille-type model with increasing the tube wall stiffness.

example Intel's E7-8800 processor uses 24MB L3 cache. Further, with each CMOS
technology generation, leakage energy has been dramatically increasing and
hence, leakage energy is expected to become a major source of energy
dissipation, especially in last-level caches (LLCs). The conventional schemes
of cache energy saving either aim at saving dynamic energy or are based on
properties specific to first-level caches, and thus these schemes have limited
utility for last-level caches. Further, several other techniques require
offline profiling or per-application tuning and hence are not suitable for
product systems. In this research, we propose novel cache leakage energy saving
schemes for single-core and multicore systems; desktop, QoS, real-time and
server systems. We propose software-controlled, hardware-assisted techniques
which use dynamic cache reconfiguration to configure the cache to the most
energy efficient configuration while keeping the performance loss bounded. To
profile and test a large number of potential configurations, we utilize
low-overhead, micro-architecture components, which can be easily integrated
into modern processor chips. We adopt a system-wide approach to save energy to
ensure that cache reconfiguration does not increase energy consumption of other
components of the processor. We have compared our techniques with the
state-of-art techniques and have found that our techniques outperform them in
their energy efficiency. This research has important applications in improving
energy-efficiency of higher-end embedded, desktop, server processors and
multitasking systems. We have also proposed performance estimation approach for
efficient design space exploration and have implemented time-sampling based
simulation acceleration approach for full-system architectural simulators.

transitions in neuronal networks stimulated by shot noise (a flow of random

neuronal networks on classical random networks, we find critical phenomena
accompanying the transitions and their dependence on the shot noise intensity.
We show that a pattern of spontaneous neuronal activity near a critical point
of a phase transition is a characteristic property that can be used to identify
the bifurcation mechanism of the transition. We demonstrate that bursts and
avalanches are precursors of a first-order phase transition, paroxysmal-like
spikes of activity precede a second-order phase transition caused by a
saddle-node bifurcation, while irregular spindle oscillations represent
spontaneous activity near a second-order phase transition caused by a
supercritical Hopf bifurcation. Our most interesting result is the observation
of the paroxysmal-like spikes. We show that a paroxysmal-like spike is a single
nonlinear event that appears instantly from a low background activity with a
rapid onset, reaches a large amplitude, and ends up with an abrupt return to
lower activity. These spikes are similar to single paroxysmal spikes and sharp
waves observed in EEG measurements. Our analysis shows that above the
saddle-node bifurcation, sustained network oscillations appear with a large
amplitude but a small frequency in contrast to network oscillations near the
Hopf bifurcation that have a small amplitude but a large frequency. We discuss
an amazing similarity between excitability of the cortical model stimulated by
shot noise and excitability of the Morris-Lecar neuron stimulated by an applied

paper, we characterize i) the initiation process in which the number of arms in
the starburst is controlled by the ratio of surface tension contrast to the
gel's elastic modulus and ii) the propagation dynamics showing that once
fractures are initiated they propagate with a universal power law $L\propto
t^{3/4}$. We develop a model for crack initiation by treating the gel as a
linear elastic solid and computing the deformations within the substrate from
the liquid/solid wetting forces. The elastic solution shows that both the
location and magnitude of the wetting forces are critical in providing a
quantitative prediction for the number of fractures and, hence, an
interpretation of the initiation of capillary fractures. This solution also
reveals that the depth of the gel is an important factor in the fracture
process, as it can help mitigate large surface tractions; this finding is
confirmed with experiments. We then develop a model for crack propagation by
considering the transport of an inviscid fluid into the fracture tip of an

emission lines from highly ionized atoms. Although the X-ray spectrum of the
GRXE can be well fitted with a plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium
(CIE), that of GC South cannot be fitted with a plasma in CIE, leaving
hump-like residuals at ~2.5 and 3.5 keV, which are attributable to the
radiative recombination continua of the K-shells of Si and S, respectively. In
fact, GC South spectrum is well fitted with a recombination-dominant plasma
model; the electron temperature is 0.46 keV while atoms are highly ionized (kT
= 1.6 keV) in the initial epoch, and the plasma is now in a recombining phase
at a relaxation scale (plasma density x elapsed time) of 5.3 x 10^11 s cm^-3.
The absorption column density of GC South is consistent with that toward the GC
region. Thus GC South is likely to be located in the GC region (~8 kpc
distance). The size of the plasma, the mean density, and the thermal energy are
estimated to be 97 pc x 37 pc, 0.16 cm^-3, and 1.6 x 10^51 erg, respectively.

overabundant in heavy elements, such as Mg, Si, S, Ca, Fe, and Ni. The
unprecedentedly high quality of data obtained by XIS, allowed us to correctly
distinguish between the emissions from the ISM and the ejecta for the first
time. Combining XIS spectral analysis with Chandra/ACIS image analysis, we
verified that the ejecta distributions for elements from Si to Fe-K were
similar to one another, although Fe-K emission was located slightly inward
compared with that of lighter elements such as Si, S, Ar, and Ca. The
onion-like structure of the ejecta was maintained after the SN. In addition,
the ISM emission represented by O and Fe-L was located inside the ejecta
emission. We compared hydrogen-rich ejecta plasma, which is indicative of Type
II SNRs, with plasma rich in heavy elements and poor in hydrogen, which is
mainly observed in Type Ia. In the case of N103B, we could not determine
whether the origin of the continuum emission in the 4.0-6.0keV band was from
ejecta or high-temperature ISM only based on the spectral modeling of XIS data.
High-energy continuum images in the 5.2-6.0keV band obtained by ACIS were
extremely similar to those of ejecta, implying that the origin of the
high-energy continuum might indeed be the ejecta. By combining spectral
analysis with high-energy continuum images, we found some indications for
H-dominated plasma, and as a result, that the progenitor of N103B might have
been a Type II. The progenitor mass was estimated to be 13 Msun based on the

both physicists and mathematicians. However, our understanding of this
fascinating phenomenon is not complete yet. In particular, most former studies
of the tail phenomenon have focused on scattering potentials which approach
zero asymptotically ($x\to\infty$) faster than $x^{-2}$. It is well-known that
for these (rapidly decaying) scattering potentials the late-time tails are
determined by the first Born approximation and are therefore {\it linear} in
the amplitudes of the scattering potentials (there are, however, some
exceptional cases in which the first Born approximation vanishes and one has to
consider higher orders of the scattering problem). In the present study we
analyze in detail the late-time dynamics of the Klein-Gordon wave equation with
a ({\it slowly} decaying) Coulomb-like scattering potential:
$V(x\to\infty)=\alpha/x$. In particular, we write down an explicit solution
(that is, an exact analytic solution which is not based on the first Born
approximation) for this scattering problem. It is found that the asymptotic
($t\to\infty$) late-time behavior of the fields depends {\it non}-linearly on
the amplitude $\alpha$ of the scattering potential. This non-linear dependence
on the amplitude of the scattering potential reflects the fact that the
late-time dynamics associated with this slowly decaying scattering potential is
dominated by {\it multiple} scattering from asymptotically far regions.

we introduce a method for mapping the behavioral space of organisms, relying
only upon the underlying structure of postural movement data to organize and
classify behaviors. We find that six different drosophilid species each perform
a mix of non-stereotyped actions and over one hundred hierarchically-organized,
stereotyped behaviors. Moreover, we use this approach to compare these species'
behavioral spaces, systematically identifying subtle behavioral differences
between closely-related species.

directly-imaging interferometer observing the Sun at 5.7 GHz. The SSRT operates
in the two-dimensional mode since 1996. The imaging principle of the SSRT
restricts its opportunities in observations of very bright flare sources, while
it is possible to use `dirty' images in studies of low brightness features,
which do not overlap with side lobes from bright sources. The interactive CLEAN
technique routinely used for the SSRT data provides imaging of active regions
but consumes much time and efforts and does not reveal low-brightness features
below the CLEAN threshold. The newly developed technique combines the CLEAN
routine with the directly imaging capability of the SSRT and provides clean
images with an enhanced dynamic range automatically. These elaborations
considerably extend the range of tasks, which can be solved with the SSRT. We
show some examples of the present opportunities of the SSRT and compare its
data with the images produced by the Nobeyama Radioheliograph at 17 GHz as well
as observations in different spectral ranges.

  Divergence-Free Constrained Transport for Ideal MHD","26 pages, 6 figures",,,,"math.NA physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The modification of the celebrated Yee scheme from Maxwell equations to
magnetohydrodynamics is often referred to as the constrained transport
approach. Constrained transport can be viewed as a sort of predictor-corrector
method for updating the magnetic field, where a magnetic field value is first
predicted by a method that does not preserve the divergence-free condition on
the magnetic field, followed by a correction step that aims to control these
divergence errors. This strategy has been successfully used in conjunction with
a variety of shock-capturing methods including WENO, central, and wave
propagation schemes. In this work we show how to extend the basic CT framework
to the discontinuous Galerkin finite element method on both 2D and 3D Cartesian
grids. We first review the entropy-stability theory for semi-discrete DG
discretizations of ideal MHD, which rigorously establishes the need for a
magnetic field that satisfies the following conditions: (1) the divergence of
the magnetic field is zero on each element, and (2) the normal components of
the magnetic field are continuous across element edges/faces. In order to
achieve such a globally divergence-free magnetic field, we introduce a novel CT
scheme that is based on two ingredients: (1) we introduce an element-centered
magnetic vector potential that is updated via a discontinuous Galerkin scheme
on the induction equation; and (2) we define a mapping that takes
element-centered magnetic field values and element-centered magnetic vector
potential values and creates on each edge /face a representation of the normal
component of the magnetic field; this representation is then mapped back to the
elements to create a globally divergence-free element-centered representation
of the magnetic field. For problems with shock waves, we make use of so-called
moment-based limiters to control oscillations in the conserved quantities.

collected from multiple sources for prediction tasks. Combining multiple models
or data sources helps to counteract the effects of low data quality and the
bias of any single model or data source, and thus can improve the robustness
and the performance of predictive models. Out of privacy, storage and bandwidth
considerations, in certain circumstances one has to combine the predictions
from multiple models or data sources to obtain the final predictions without
accessing the raw data. Consensus-based prediction combination algorithms are
effective for such situations. However, current research on prediction
combination focuses on the single label setting, where an instance can have one
and only one label. Nonetheless, data nowadays are usually multilabeled, such
that more than one label have to be predicted at the same time. Direct
applications of existing prediction combination methods to multilabel settings
can lead to degenerated performance. In this paper, we address the challenges
of combining predictions from multiple multilabel classifiers and propose two
novel algorithms, MLCM-r (MultiLabel Consensus Maximization for ranking) and
MLCM-a (MLCM for microAUC). These algorithms can capture label correlations
that are common in multilabel classifications, and optimize corresponding
performance metrics. Experimental results on popular multilabel classification

Assuming a thermal collisional-ionization-equilibrium model, the fitted

6.7 keV line and is likely a supernova remnant or a superbubble. The fitted Fe
abundance of the point source is 1.7 solar value. It implies that part of the

is about 5 solar value assuming complete mixing. If this is a representative
case of the Fe enrichment, a mild mass-loading of a factor of 3 will make the
Fe abundance of the point source in agreement with that of the hot gas, which

depending on the phone orientation and user context (for example, whether the
user is carrying the phone in a bag or holding it in her palm). To address this
problem, Ear-Phone leverages context-aware sensing. We develop classifiers to
accurately determine the phone sensing context. Upon context discovery,
Ear-Phone automatically decides whether to sense or not. Ear-phone also
implements in-situ calibration which performs simple calibration that can be
carried out without any technical skills whatsoever required on the user's
part. Extensive simulations and outdoor experiments demonstrate that Ear-Phone
is a feasible platform to assess noise pollution, incurring reasonable system
resource consumption at mobile devices and providing high reconstruction
accuracy of the noise map.

electrons but rather involves collective interaction between Cooper pairs. The
pseudo-gap may also be understood to originate from this BCS-type gap of the
CDW system, in which the parameters are identical to those in the original BCS
scheme, except that the electron-electron interaction is multiplied by a factor
NCDW, which represents the number of electrons of the same spin direction that
belong to a single CDW branch that comprises half the SDW. The superconducting
gap then becomes an s dx2-y2-type gap. This gap may be calculated by assuming a
modified BCS-like scheme that takes into account the contributions of the CDWs.
These CDWs may be driven spatially into a checkerboard-shaped (or striped) form
of superconductivity, depending on whether the CDW is two- or one-dimensional.
The origin of the nodal gap may also be ascribed to the CDWs.

Keldysh-Floquet dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), which can determine the
fully-interacting, nonequilibrium steady-state Green's functions with the
noninteracting counterparts as an input to the DMFT self-consistency loop.
Unlike the retarded component, obtaining the lesser Green's function for the
noninteracting system presents an important obstacle since the thermalization
of the noninteracting system still requires a precise understanding of the
dissipation mechanism. A crucial breakthrough in this work is that the
noninteracting lesser Green's function can be determined in terms of the
Wannier-Stark ladder (WSL) eigenstates, which are thermalized via the standard
canonical ensemble according to the Markovian quantum master equation. As a
result, it is shown that the intricate interplay between strong correlation and
large electric field can generate a sequence of two dielectric breakdowns with
the first induced by a coherent reconstruction of the mid-gap state within the
Mott gap and the second by an incoherent tunneling through the biased Hubbard
bands. It is predicted that the reconstructed mid-gap state generates its own
emergent WSL structure with a reduced effective electric field. The two
dielectric breakdowns are mediated by a reentrant insulating phase, which is
characterized by the population inversion, causing instability toward
inhomogeneous current density states at weak electron-impurity scattering.

sub-nanosecond timing resolution. Among the various techniques already

performance may be achieved with limited processing ressources. This issue is
relevant for applications where unmanned sensors should have the lowest

application of this kind of tof technique to muon tomography of geological
bodies. Muon tomography aims at measuring density variations and absolute
densities through the detection of atmospheric muons flux's attenuation, due to
the presence of matter. When the measured fluxes become very low, an identified
source of noise comes from backwards propagating particles hitting the detector
in a direction pointing to the geological body. The separation between
through-going and backward-going particles, on the basis of the tof information
is therefore a key parameter for the tomography analysis and subsequent
previsions.

simple 1-D radiative convective models and did not account well for the clouds
and ice-albedo feedback or the atmospheric and oceanic transport of energy. We
apply a global climate model (GCM) to test the different solutions to the faint
young Sun problem. We explore the effect of greenhouse gases (CO2 and CH4),
atmospheric pressure, cloud droplet size, land distribution, and Earth's
rotation rate. We show that neglecting organic haze, 100 mbar of CO2 with 2
mbar of CH4 at 3.8 Ga and 10 mbar of CO2 with 2 mbar of CH4 at 2.5 Ga allow a
temperate climate (mean surface temperature between 10{\deg}C and 20{\deg}C).
Such amounts of greenhouse gases remain consistent with the geological data.
Removing continents produces a warming lower than +4{\deg}C. The effect of
rotation rate is even more limited. Larger droplets (radii of 17 microns versus
12 microns) and a doubling of the atmospheric pressure produce a similar
warming of around +7{\deg}C. In our model, ice-free water belts can be
maintained up to 25{\deg}N/S with less than 1 mbar of CO2 and no methane. An
interesting cloud feedback appears above cold oceans, stopping the glaciation.
Such a resistance against full glaciation tends to strongly mitigate the faint

extended to extrapolate the solution of a divergent iteration. In addition,
higher order Aitken extrapolation is introduced that enables successive
decomposition of high Eigen values of the iteration matrix to enable
convergence. While extrapolation of a convergent fixed point iteration using a
geometric series sum is a known form of Aitken acceleration, it is shown in
this paper that the same formula can be used to estimate the solution of sets
of linear equations from diverging Gauss Seidel iterations. In both convergent
and divergent iterations, the ratios of differences among the consecutive
values of iteration eventually form a convergent or divergent series with a
factor equal to the largest Eigen value of the iteration matrix. Higher order
Aitken extrapolation is shown to eliminate the influence of dominant Eigen
values of the iteration matrix in successive order until the iteration is
determined by the lowest possible Eigen value. For the convergent part of the
Gauss Seidel iteration, further acceleration is made possible by coupling of
the extrapolation technique with the successive over relaxation method.
Application examples from both convergent and divergent iterations have been

technique is also illustrated for a steady state two dimensional heat flow

genomes represented either as permutations or as sequences. Whereas optimal
algorithms for finding common intervals in permutations exist even for an
arbitrary number of permutations, in sequences no optimal algorithm has been
proposed yet even for only two sequences. Surprisingly enough, when sequences
are reduced to permutations, the existing algorithms perform far from the
optimum, showing that their performances are not dependent, as they should be,
on the structural complexity of the input sequences.
  In this paper, we propose to characterize the structure of a sequence by the
number $q$ of different dominating orders composing it (called the domination
number), and to use a recent algorithm for permutations in order to devise a
new algorithm for two sequences. Its running time is in
$O(q_1q_2p+q_1n_1+q_2n_2+N)$, where $n_1, n_2$ are the sizes of the two
sequences, $q_1,q_2$ are their respective domination numbers, $p$ is the
alphabet size and $N$ is the number of solutions to output. This algorithm
performs better as $q_1$ and/or $q_2$ reduce, and when the two sequences are
reduced to permutations (i.e. when $q_1=q_2=1$) it has the same running time as
the best algorithms for permutations. It is also the first algorithm for
sequences whose running time involves the parameter size of the solution. As a
counterpart, when $q_1$ and $q_2$ are of $O(n_1)$ and $O(n_2)$ respectively,
the algorithm is less efficient than other approaches.

  Multicasting",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Application layer multicast (ALM) also called Overlay Multicast, is an
attractive alternative solution to most of the problems associated with IP
multicast. In ALM, multicast-related functionalities are moved to end-hosts.
Application layer multicast builds a peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay topology
consisting of end-to-end unicast connections between end-hosts. The key
advantages, overlays offer, are flexibility, adaptability and ease of
deployment [1]. The general approach to build an application layer multicast
architecture involves tracking network characteristics and building appropriate
topologies by allowing the end users to self organize into logical overlay
networks for efficient data delivery. The major concern in designing ALM
protocol is the mechanism to build and maintain a topology and to route data
efficiently and reliably in this topology. We propose here a two-fold dynamic
overlay tree construction and maintenance scheme in which a mesh-like topology
is first built, where an arriving host connects to two already connected hosts.
This ensures that two node and link disjoint paths are always maintained
between every possible pair of nodes. Once the mesh is formed, on top of it, a
single or multiple data delivery tree(s) are built using a suitable protocol.
An algorithm is run in the nodes of the overlay topology to maintain the
biconnectivity by inserting new links and deleting the redundant links as a
continuous process.

of designing ZFBF in cognitive networks lies in how to obtain the interference
CSI. To solve it, we introduce a limited inter-network cooperation protocol,
namely the quantized CSI conveyance from the primary receiver to the cognitive
BS via purchase. Clearly, the more the feedback amount, the better the
performance, but the higher the feedback cost. In order to achieve a balance
between the performance and feedback cost, we take the maximization of feedback
utility function, defined as the difference of average sum rate and feedback
cost while satisfying the interference constraint, as the optimization
objective, and derive the transmission mode and feedback amount joint
optimization scheme. Moreover, we quantitatively investigate the impact of CSI
feedback delay and obtain the corresponding optimization scheme. Furthermore,
through asymptotic analysis, we present some simple schemes. Finally, numerical
results confirm the effectiveness of our theoretical claims.

the first-pulse streamers. We call the maximal time for which this continuation
still occurs the continuation time. For N$_{2}$ - O$_{2}$ mixtures, this time
has a maximum at an oxygen concentration of about 0.2%. According to our plasma
chemical modelling this maximum is determined by the electron loss rate which
has a minimum around this oxygen concentration. Depending on oxygen
concentration the dominant recombining positive ion is N$_{4}^{+}$, O$_2^+$ or
O$_{4}^{+}$ where O$_{2}^{+}$ dominates around 0.2% O$_{2}$ and recombines
slowest. For increasing values of {\Delta}t we observe that after the
continuation phase first no new streamers occur at all, then new streamers show
up that avoid the entire pre-ionized region. Next we see new thin streamers
that follow the edges of the old channels. For larger {\Delta}t (10-200 {\mu}s)

membranes, combining the seemingly antagonist functions of a very high
selectivity with a remarkable permeability. Whereas molecular details are
obvious keys to perform these tasks, the overall efficiency of transport in
such nanopores is also strongly limited by viscous dissipation arising at the
connection between the nanoconstriction and the nearby bulk reservoirs. In this
contribution, we focus on these so-called entrance effects and specifically
examine whether the characteristic hourglass shape of aquaporins may arise from
a geometrical optimum for such hydrodynamic dissipation. Using a combination of
finite-element calculations and analytical modeling, we show that conical
entrances with suitable opening angle can indeed provide a large increase of
the overall channel permeability. Moreover, the optimal opening angles that
maximize the permeability are found to compare well with the angles measured in
a large variety of aquaporins. This suggests that the hourglass shape of
aquaporins could be the result of a natural selection process toward optimal
hydrodynamic transport. Finally, in a biomimetic perspective, these results
provide guidelines to design artificial nanopores with optimal performances.

different aggregate types are affected by erosion. Especially, it is important
to study the influence of the velocity of the impacting projectiles. We also
want to provide models for dust growth in protoplanetary disks with simple
recipes to account for erosion effects.
  Methods: To study the erosion of dust aggregates we employed a molecular
dynamics approach that features a detailed micro-physical model of the
interaction of spherical grains. For the first time, the model has been
extended by introducing a new visco-elastic damping force which requires a
proper calibration. Afterwards, different sample generation methods were used
to cover a wide range of aggregate types.
  Results: The visco-elastic damping force introduced in this work turns out to
be crucial to reproduce results obtained from laboratory experiments. After
proper calibration, we find that erosion occurs for impact velocities of 5 m/s
and above. Though fractal aggregates as formed during the first growth phase
are most susceptible to erosion, we observe erosion of aggregates with rather
compact surfaces as well.
  Conclusions: We find that bombarding a larger target aggregate with small
projectiles results in erosion for impact velocities as low as a few m/s. More
compact aggregates suffer less from erosion. With increasing projectile size
the transition from accretion to erosion is shifted to higher velocities. This
allows larger bodies to grow through high velocity collisions with smaller
aggregates.

tomograms, obtained by means of group-theoretical methods. A typical problem
arising in this context is to express the evolution of a quantum system in
terms of tomograms. In the case of a (suitable) open quantum system, the
dynamics can be described by means of a quantum dynamical semigroup 'in

on density operators. We focus on a special class of quantum dynamical
semigroups, the twirling semigroups, that have interesting applications, e.g.,
in quantum information science. The 'disguised counterparts' of the twirling

class of semigroups of operators that we call tomographic semigroups. We show
that the twirling semigroups and the tomographic semigroups can be encompassed

also the probability semigroups of classical probability theory, so achieving a
deeper insight into both the mathematical and the physical aspects of the

in dense gas without the usual molecules, cooling to the required near-zero
temperatures by atomic transitions and dust radiation rather than molecular
line emission (Krumholz 2012), and it highlights uncertainties about star
formation in the early universe, when the metallicity was generally low. Here
we report the detection of CO in two regions of a local dwarf irregular galaxy,
WLM, where the metallicity is 13% of the solar value (Lee et al. 2005, Asplund

observations are used to estimate the cloud masses, which are both slightly
larger than 10^5 Msun. The clouds have produced stars at a rate per molecule

suggest that both star-forming cores and CO molecules become increasingly rare

star-forming processes. They may have been caused by the passage of the density
wave or simply created by other means near the arms. The study of these regions
may give us clues to clarifying the controversy over the existence of a
triggering scenario, as proposed in the density wave theory. Using H$\alpha$
direct imaging, we characterize the HII regions from a sample of three grand
design galaxies: NGC5457, NGC628 and NGC6946. Broad band images in R and I were
used to determine the position of the arms. The HII regions found to be
associated with arms were selected for the study. The age and the star
formation rate of these HII regions was obtained using measures on the
H$\alpha$ line. The distance between the current position of the selected HII
regions and the position they would have if they had been created in the centre
of the arm is calculated. A parameter, T, which measures whether a region was
created in the arm or in the disc, is defined. With the help of the T parameter
we determine that the majority of regions were formed some time after the
passage of the density wave, with the regions located `behind the arm' (in the
direction of the rotation of the galaxy) the zone they should have occupied had
they been formed in the centre of the arm. The presence of the large number of
regions created after the passage of the arm may be explained by the effect of
the density wave, which helps to create the star-forming regions after its
passage. There is clear evidence of triggering for NGC5457 and a co-rotation
radius is proposed. A more modest triggering seems to exist for NGC628 and non
significant evidence of triggering are found for NGC6946.

tangent spheres composing the molecule (SW-SW model); in the second scheme, one
of square-well interactions is switched off (HS-SW model). Appreciable
differences emerge between the physical properties of the two models.
Specifically, the $k \to 0$ behavior of SW-SW structure factors $S(k)$ points
to the presence of a gas-liquid coexistence, as confirmed by subsequent fluid
phase equilibria calculations. Conversely, the HS-SW $S(k)$ develops a low-$k$
peak, signaling the presence of aggregates; such a process destabilizes the
gas-liquid phase separation, promoting at low temperatures the formation of a
cluster phase, whose structure depends on the system density. We further
investigate such differences by studying the phase behavior of a series of
intermediate models, obtained from the original SW-SW by progressively reducing
the depth of one square-well interaction. RISM structural predictions
positively reproduce the simulation data, including the rise of $S(k \to 0$) in
the SW-SW model and the low-$k$ peak in the HS-SW structure factor. As for the
phase behavior, RISM agrees with Monte Carlo simulations in predicting a
gas-liquid coexistence for the SW-SW model (though the critical parameters
appears overestimated by the theory) and its progressive disappearance moving
toward the HS-SW model.

formed by the triangular UC2 adsorbed at the hollow site of the graphene.

gravitational lensing, redshift space distortions, and the estimator of gravity
$E_G$. Current data favor general relativity (GR) over nonlocal gravity: fixing
primordial cosmology with the best fit parameters from Planck leads to weak
lensing results favoring GR by 5.9 sigma; redshift space distortions
measurements of the growth rate preferring GR by 7.8 sigma; and the single
measurement of $E_G$ favoring GR, but by less than 1-sigma. The significance
holds up even after the parameters are allowed to vary within Planck limits.
The larger lesson is that a successful modified gravity model will likely have
to suppress the growth of structure compared to general relativity.

fluctuations within the Falicov-Kimball model. Using the Dynamic Mean Field
Theory (DMFT) formalism on the Bethe lattice we find rigorously the temperature
dependent Density of States ($DOS$) at half filling in the limit of high
dimensions. At zero temperature (T=0) the system is ordered to form the
checkerboard pattern and the $DOS$ has the gap $\Delta$ at the Fermi level
$\varepsilon_F=0$, which is proportional to the interaction constant $U$. With
an increase of $T$ the $DOS$ evolves in various ways that depend on $U$. For
$U>U_{cr}$ the gap persists for any $T$ (then $\Delta >0$), so the system is
always an insulator. However, if $U < U_{cr}$, two additional subbands develop
inside the gap. They become wider with increasing $T$ and at a certain
$U$-dependent temperature $T_{MI}$ they join with each other at
$\varepsilon_F$. Since above $T_{MI}$ the $DOS$ is positive at $\varepsilon_F$,
we interpret $T_{MI}$ as the transformation temperature from insulator to
metal. It appears, that $T_{MI}$ approaches the order-disorder phase transition
temperature $T_{O-DO}$ when $U$ is close to 0 or $ U_{cr}$, but $T_{MI}$ is
substantially lower than $T_{O-DO}$ for intermediate values of $U$. Having
calculated the temperature dependent $DOS$ we study thermodynamic properties of
the system starting from its free energy $F$. Then we find how the order
parameter $d$ and the gap $\Delta $ change with $T$ and we construct the phase
diagram in the variables $T$ and $U$, where we display regions of stability of
four different phases: ordered insulator, ordered metal, disordered insulator
and disordered metal. Finally, we use a low temperature expansion to
demonstrate the existence of a nonzero DOS at a characteristic value of U on a
general bipartite lattice.

problem of image deconvolution, based on an interferometric point of view of
image formation. Kernel-phase inherits and borrows from the notion of
closure-phase, especially as it is used in the context of non-redundant Fizeau
interferometry, but extends its application to pupils of arbitrary shape, for
diffraction limited images. The additional calibration brought by kernel-phase
boosts the resolution of conventional images and enables the detection of
otherwise hidden faint features at the resolution limit and beyond, a regime
often refered to as super-resolution, which for a 30-meter telescope in the
near IR, this translates into a resolving power smaller than 10 mas.
Kernel-phase analysis of archival space and ground based AO data leads to new
discoveries and/or improved relative astrometry and photometry. The paper
presents the current status of the technique and some of its recent
developments and applications that lead to recommendations for super-resolution

theoretical description of macroscopic elastic properties of textured

task. In this communication we use a supercell-based approach to obtain the
elastic properties of random solid solution cubic ZrAlN system as a function of
the metallic sublattice composition and texture descriptors. The employed
special quasi-random structures are optimised not only with respect to short
range order parameters, but also to make the three cubic directions
$[1\,0\,0]$, $[0\,1\,0]$, and $[0\,0\,1]$ as similar as possible. In this way,
only a small spread of elastic constants tensor components is achieved and an
optimum trade-off between modelling of chemical disorder and computational
limits regarding the supercell size is achieved. The single crystal elastic
constants are shown to vary smoothly with composition, yielding
$x\approx0.4$-0.5 an alloy constitution with an almost isotropic response.
Consequently, polycrystals with this composition are suggested to have Young's
modulus independent on the actual microstructure. This is indeed confirmed by
explicit calculations of polycrystal elastic properties, both within the
isotropic aggregate limit, as well as with fibre textures with various
orientations and sharpness. It turns out, that for low AlN mole fractions, the
spread of the possible Young's moduli data caused by the texture variation can
be larger than 100 GPa. Consequently, our discussion of Young's modulus data of
cubic ZrAlN contains also the evaluation of the texture typical for thin films.

collapse causing a bursting mode of star formation. Finally, we compare our

symbol detection algorithm which computes vector messages using a scalar
Gaussian approximation of interference, which results in a total complexity of
just $O(KN\sqrt{M})$, where $K$ is the number of uplink users and $N$ is the
number of base station (BS) antennas. The proposed NB-BP detector does not need
to do a matrix inversion, which gives a complexity advantage over MMSE
detection. We then design optimized $q$-ary LDPC codes by matching the EXIT
charts of the proposed detector and the LDPC decoder. Simulation results show
that the proposed NB-BP detection-decoding approach using the optimized LDPC

of age bins. Since the uncertainty in a cluster's age can be large compared to
the size of the age bins, we account for the fact that a cluster could actually
reside in one of a few adjacent age bins. We confirm that there exist some
variations of the LMC CFs in terms of their spatial distributions, although
some caveats should be pointed out. 30 Doradus resulted to be the region with
the highest relative frequency of youngest clusters, while the log($t$) = 9-9.5

inner regions than in the outer ones. We compared the observed CFs to
theoretical CFs, which are based on the star formation histories of the field
stars in each region of the LMC, and found the former predicting more or fewer

At low redshift the Balmer lines,particularly broad H beta, are the lines of
choice. For redshifts greater than 0.7 - 0.8 one can follow H beta into the IR
windows or find an H beta surrogate. We explain why UV CIV 1549 is not a safe
virial estimator and how MgII 2800 serves as the best virial surrogate for H
beta up to the highest redshift quasar known at z ~ 7. We show how spectral
binning in a parameter space context (4DE1) makes possible a more effective
comparison of H beta and MgII. It also helps to derive more accurate mass
estimates from appropriately binned spectra and, finally, to map the dispersion
in black hole mass and Eddington ratio across the quasar population. FWHM MgII
is about 20% smaller than FWHM H beta in the majority of type 1 AGN requiring
correction when comparing black hole mass estimates from these two lines. The
20% of sources showing narrowest FWHM H beta (< 4000 km/s) and strongest FeII
(R_FeII >~ 1.0) emission (we call them bin A3-4 sources) do not show this FWHM
difference and a blueshift detected in MgII for these sources suggests that
FWHM H beta is the safer virial estimator for these extreme Eddington emitters.

Ferromagnetic/Pt (F/Pt) interfaces, spin-flipping at the interface. The latter
is characterized by an interface spin-flipping parameter, delta(Co/Pt) that
specifies the probability P = [1 - exp(-delta)] of a conduction electron
flipping its spin direction as it traverses a Co/Pt interface. From studies of
the Current-Perpendicular-to-Plane (CPP) Resistances and Magnetoresistances of
sputtered ferromagnetically coupled Co/Pt multilayers by themselves, and
embedded within Py-based Double Exchange-biased Spin-Valves, we derive values
at 4.2K of delta(Co/Pt) = 0.9 (+0.5/-0.2), the interface specific resistance,
AR*(Co/Pt) = 0.74 +/- 0.15 fohm-m(2). and the interface spin-scattering
asymmetry, gamma(Co/Pt) = 0.58 +/- 0.12. This value of delta(Co/Pt) is much
larger than ones previously found for interfaces involving Co but not Pt. To
derive delta requires knowledge of the spin-diffusion length, lsf(Pt), for our
sputtered Pt. We derive lsf(Pt) from separate measurements. Combining our
results with those from others, we find that lsf(Pt) for Pt is approximately
proportional to the inverse resistivity, 1/rho(Pt).

moment and the dimension $m$ and the sample size $n$ satisfy $\log
m=o(n^{1/3})$, B-H method controls the false discovery rate (FDR) at a given
level $\alpha$ asymptotically with p-values estimated from N(0,1) or $t_{n-1}$
distribution. However, a phase transition phenomenon occurs when $\log m\geq
c_{0}n^{1/3}$. In this case, the FDR of B-H method may be larger than $\alpha$
or even tends to one. In contrast, the bootstrap calibration is accurate for
$\log m=o(n^{1/2})$ as long as the underlying distribution has the sub-Gaussian
tails. However, such light tailed condition can not be weakened in general. The
simulation study shows that for the heavy tailed distributions, the bootstrap
calibration is very conservative. In order to solve this problem, a regularized
bootstrap correction is proposed and is shown to be robust to the tails of the
distributions. The simulation study shows that the regularized bootstrap method
performs better than the usual bootstrap method.

summation algorithms, such as the fast multipole method (FMM), the periodized
extension is usually treated via a different algorithm, Ewald summation,
accelerated via the fast Fourier transform (FFT). A different approach to
compute this periodized sum just using a blackbox finite fast summation
algorithm is presented in this paper. The method splits the periodized sum in
to two parts. The first, comprising the contribution of all points outside a
large sphere enclosing the box, and some of its neighbors, is approximated
inside the box by a collection of kernel functions (""sources"") placed on the
surface of the sphere or using an expansion in terms of spectrally convergent
local basis functions. The second part, comprising the part inside the sphere,
and including the box and its immediate neighborhood, is treated via available
summation algorithms. The coefficients of the sources are determined by least
squares collocation of the periodicity condition of the total potential,
imposed on a circumspherical surface for the box. While the method is presented
in general, details are worked out for the case of evaluating electrostatic
potentials and forces. Results show that when used with the FMM, the periodized
sum can be computed to any specified accuracy, at an additional cost of the
order of the free-space FMM. Several technical details and efficient algorithms

in doing so a strictly convex objective whose gradients can be computed for a
considerably cheaper computational cost using matrix scaling algorithms. We use
these algorithms to visualize a large family of images and to solve a

empirical networks are crucial steps in understanding how complex systems
function. However, most existing methods used to obtain the modular structure
of networks suffer from serious problems, such as being oblivious to the
statistical evidence supporting the discovered patterns, which results in the
inability to separate actual structure from noise. In addition to this, one
also observes a resolution limit on the size of communities, where smaller but
well-defined clusters are not detectable when the network becomes large. This
phenomenon occurs not only for the very popular approach of modularity
optimization, which lacks built-in statistical validation, but also for more
principled methods based on statistical inference and model selection, which do
incorporate statistical validation in a formally correct way. Here we construct
a nested generative model that, through a complete description of the entire
network hierarchy at multiple scales, is capable of avoiding this limitation,
and enables the detection of modular structure at levels far beyond those
possible with current approaches. Even with this increased resolution, the
method is based on the principle of parsimony, and is capable of separating
signal from noise, and thus will not lead to the identification of spurious
modules even on sparse networks. Furthermore, it fully generalizes other
approaches in that it is not restricted to purely assortative mixing patterns,
directed or undirected graphs, and ad hoc hierarchical structures such as
binary trees. Despite its general character, the approach is tractable, and can
be combined with advanced techniques of community detection to yield an
efficient algorithm that scales well for very large networks.

we have undertaken a search for magnetic fields at the surface of Mira stars.
We used spectropolarimetric observations, collected with the Narval instrument
at TBL, in order to detect - with Least Squares Deconvolution method - a Zeeman
signature in the visible part of the spectrum. We present the first
spectropolarimetric observations of the S-type Mira star chi Cyg, performed
around its maximum light. We have detected a polarimetric signal in the Stokes
V spectra and we have established its Zeeman origin. We claim that it is likely
to be related to a weak magnetic field present at the photospheric level and in
the lower part of the stellar atmosphere. We have estimated the strength of its
longitudinal component to about 2-3 Gauss. This result favors a 1/r law for the
variation of the magnetic field strength across the circumstellar envelope of
chi Cyg. This is the first detection of a weak magnetic field at the stellar
surface of a Mira star and we discuss its origin in the framework of shock
waves periodically propagating throughout the atmosphere of these radially
pulsating stars. At the date of our observations of chi Cyg, the shock wave
reaches its maximum intensity, and it is likely that the shock amplifies a weak
stellar magnetic field during its passage through the atmosphere. Without such
an amplification by the shock, the magnetic field strength would have been too
low to be detected. For the first time, we also report strong Stokes Q and U
signatures (linear polarization) centered onto the zero velocity (i.e., at the
shock front position). They seem to indicate that the radial direction would be
favored by the shock during its propagation throughout the atmosphere.

\left( \int h(x,y) \,d\mu^2 \right)^{|E(H)|}$ holds, where $\mu$ is the
Lebesgue measure on $[0,1]$ and $h$ is a bounded, non-negative, symmetric,
measurable function on $[0,1]^2$. An equivalent discrete form of the conjecture
is that the number of homomorphisms from a bipartite graph $H$ to a graph $G$
is asymptotically at least the expected number of homomorphisms from $H$ to the
Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph with the same expected edge density as $G$. In
this paper, we present two approaches to the conjecture. First, we introduce
the notion of tree-arrangeability, where a bipartite graph $H$ with bipartition
$A \cup B$ is tree-arrangeable if neighborhoods of vertices in $A$ have a
certain tree-like structure. We show that Sidorenko's conjecture holds for all
tree-arrangeable bipartite graphs. In particular, this implies that Sidorenko's
conjecture holds if there are two vertices $a_1, a_2$ in $A$ such that each
vertex $a \in A$ satisfies $N(a) \subseteq N(a_1)$ or $N(a) \subseteq N(a_2)$,
and also implies a recent result of Conlon, Fox, and Sudakov \cite{CoFoSu}.
Second, if $T$ is a tree and $H$ is a bipartite graph satisfying Sidorenko's
conjecture, then it is shown that the Cartesian product $T \Box H$ of $T$ and
$H$ also satisfies Sidorenko's conjecture. This result implies that, for all $d
\ge 2$, the $d$-dimensional grid with arbitrary side lengths satisfies
Sidorenko's conjecture.

pixel. In this paper we propose treating nouns as object labels and adjectives

problem as one of jointly estimating per-pixel object and attribute labels from
a set of training images. We propose an efficient (interactive time) solution.
Using the extracted labels as handles, our system empowers a user to verbally
refine the results. This enables hands-free parsing of an image into pixel-wise
object/attribute labels that correspond to human semantics. Verbally selecting
objects of interests enables a novel and natural interaction modality that can
possibly be used to interact with new generation devices (e.g. smart phones,
Google Glass, living room devices). We demonstrate our system on a large number
of real-world images with varying complexity. To help understand the tradeoffs

modalities. The concept of variable density sampling provides a nice framework
to achieve this. It was justified recently from a theoretical point of view in
the compressed sensing (CS) literature. Unfortunately, the sampling schemes
suggested by current CS theories may not be relevant since they do not take the
acquisition constraints into account (for example, continuity of the
acquisition trajectory in Magnetic Resonance Imaging - MRI). In this paper, we
propose a numerical method to perform variable density sampling with block
constraints. Our main contribution is to propose a new way to draw the blocks
in order to mimic CS strategies based on isolated measurements. The basic idea
is to minimize a tailored dissimilarity measure between a probability
distribution defined on the set of isolated measurements and a probability
distribution defined on a set of blocks of measurements. This problem turns out
to be convex and solvable in high dimension. Our second contribution is to
define an efficient minimization algorithm based on Nesterov's accelerated
gradient descent in metric spaces. We study carefully the choice of the metrics
and of the prox function. We show that the optimal choice may depend on the
type of blocks under consideration. Finally, we show that we can obtain better
MRI reconstruction results using our sampling schemes than standard strategies
such as equiangularly distributed radial lines.

three-level atomic system, the linear susceptibility at the dipole-allowed
transition is canceled through destructive interference of the direct
transition and an indirect transition pathway involving a meta-stable level,
enabled by optical pumping. EIT not only leads to light transmission at
otherwise opaque atomic transition frequencies, but also results in the slowing
of light group velocity and enhanced optical nonlinearity. In this letter, we
report an analogous behavior, denoted as phonon-induced transparency (PIT), in
AB-stacked bilayer graphene nanoribbons. Here, light absorption due to the
plasmon excitation is suppressed in a narrow window due to the coupling with
the infrared active {\Gamma}-point optical phonon, whose function here is
similar to that of the meta-stable level in EIT of atomic systems. We further
show that PIT in bilayer graphene is actively tunable by electrostatic gating,
and estimate a maximum slow light factor of around 500 at the phonon frequency
of 1580 cm-1, based on the measured spectra. Our demonstration opens an avenue
for the exploration of few-photon non-linear optics and slow light in this
novel two-dimensional material, without external optical pumping and at room

accordance with the Dzyaloshinskii--Lifshitz--Pitaevskii condition of
fluid-induced repulsion between planar bodies. We explore the stability of the

demonstrate interesting transitions (bifurcations) in the rotational stability
of the disks as a function of their size. Finally, we consider the reciprocal

inner holes in the dust distribution within a few AU, which is accompanied
nevertheless by some gas accretion onto the central star. These cavities could
possibly be created by the presence of one or more massive planets. If the gap
is created by planets and gas is still present in it, then there should be a
flow of gas past the planet into the inner region. It is our goal to study the
mass accretion rate into the gap and in particular the dependency on the
planet's mass and the thermodynamic properties of the disk. We performed 2D
hydro simulations for disks with embedded planets. We added radiative cooling
from the disk surfaces, radiative diffusion in the disk midplane, and stellar
irradiation to the energy equation to have more realistic models. The mass flow
rate into the gap region depends, for given disk thermodynamics,
non-monotonically on the mass of the planet. Generally, more massive planets
open wider and deeper gaps which would tend to reduce the mass accretion into
the inner cavity. However, for larger mass planets the outer disk becomes
eccentric and the mass flow rate is enhanced over the low mass cases. As a
result, for the isothermal disks the mass flow is always comparable to the
expected mass flow of unperturbed disks M_d, while for more realistic radiative
disks the mass flow is very small for low mass planets (<= 4 M_jup) and about
50% for larger planet masses. For the radiative disks that critical planet mass
for the disk to become eccentric is much larger that in the isothermal case.
Massive embedded planets can reduce the mass flow across the gap considerably,
to values of about an order of magnitude smaller than the standard disk
accretion rate, and can be responsible for opening large cavities. The
remaining mass flow into the central cavity is in good agreement with the
observations.

element $e \in E$ is active independently with probability $p_e$, and only a
probe of e can tell us whether it is active or not. On this universe we execute
a process that one by one probes elements --- if a probed element is active,
then we have to include it in the solution, which we gradually construct.
Throughout the process we need to obey inner constraints on the set of elements
taken into the solution, and outer constraints on the set of all probed
elements. This abstract model was presented by Gupta and Nagarajan (IPCO '13),
and provides a unified view of a number of problems. Thus far, all the results
falling under this general framework pertain mainly to the case in which we are
maximizing a linear objective function of the successfully probed elements. In
this paper we generalize the stochastic probing problem by considering a
monotone submodular objective function. We give a $(1 - 1/e)/(k_{in} +

superluminous supernova (SLSN) PS1-11ap, discovered with the Pan-STARRS1 Medium
Deep Survey at z = 0.524. This intrinsically blue transient rose slowly to
reach a peak magnitude of M_u = -21.4 mag and bolometric luminosity of 8 x
10^43 ergs^-1 before settling onto a relatively shallow gradient of decline.
The observed decline is significantly slower than those of the superluminous
type Ic SNe which have been the focus of much recent attention. Spectroscopic
similarities with the lower redshift SN2007bi and a decline rate similar to
56Co decay timescale initially indicated that this transient could be a
candidate for a pair instability supernova (PISN) explosion. Overall the
transient appears quite similar to SN2007bi and the lower redshift object
PTF12dam. The extensive data set, from 30 days before peak to 230 days after,
allows a detailed and quantitative comparison with published models of PISN
explosions. We find that the PS1-11ap data do not match these model explosion
parameters well, supporting the recent claim that these SNe are not pair
instability explosions. We show that PS1-11ap has many features in common with
the faster declining superluminous Ic supernovae and the lightcurve evolution
can also be quantitatively explained by the magnetar spin down model. At a
redshift of z = 0.524 the observer frame optical coverage provides
comprehensive restframe UV data and allows us to compare it with the
superluminous SNe recently found at high redshifts between z = 2-4. While these
high-z explosions are still plausible PISN candidates, they match the
photometric evolution of PS1-11ap and hence could be counterparts to this lower
redshift transient.

We obtained that the electron temperature ranges from 5627 K to 6839 K in these

H II regions is from 3.0\times10^{5} yr to 1.7\times10^{6} yr, and the mean age

and RDI models. We selected 23 young IRAS sources with the infrared luminosity
of >10^{3}L_{\odot} in 19 H II regions. In addition, we identified some young
stellar objects (including Class I sources), which are concentrated only in H
II regions G29.007+0.076, G44.339-0.827, and G47.028+0.232. The polycyclic

summaries of the frequent data access patterns of the queries in a distributed
graph data management system. These compact representations allow us an
efficient communication of the data structure in distributed systems. We
exploit this data structure with a new \textit{Dynamic Data Partitioning}
strategy (DYDAP) that assigns the portions of the graph according to historical
data access patterns, and guarantees a small network communication and a
computational load balance in distributed graph queries. This method is able to
adapt dynamically to new workloads and evolve when the query distribution
changes. Our experiments show that DYDAP yields a throughput up to an order of
magnitude higher than previous methods based on cache specialization, in a
variety of scenarios, and the average response time of the system is divided by
two.

characterize the motion of drops sliding over a periodic array of alternating
hydrophobic and hydrophilic stripes with large wettability contrast, and
typical width of hundreds of $\mu \textrm{m}$. The fraction of the hydrophobic
stripes has been varied from about 20% to 80%. The effects of the heterogeneous
patterning can be described by a renormalized value of the critical Bond
number, i.e. the critical dimensionless force needed to depin the drop before
it starts to move. Close to the critical Bond number we observe a jerkily
motion characterized by an evident stick-slip dynamics. As a result,
dissipation is strongly localized in time, and the mean velocity of the drops
can easily decrease by an order of magnitude compared to the sliding on
homogeneous surface. Lattice Boltzmann (LB) numerical simulations are crucial
for disclosing to what extent the sliding dynamics can be deduced from the
computed balance of capillary, viscous and body forces at varying the Bond
number, the surface composition and the liquid viscosity. Away from the
critical Bond number, we characterize both experimentally and numerically the
dissipation inside the droplet by studying the relation between the average
velocity and the applied volume forces.

galaxy, NGC628, which is part of the PPAK IFS Nearby Galaxies Survey (PINGS).
The data cover a field of view of ~6 arcmin in diameter with a sampling of
$\sim$2.7 arcsec per spectrum and a wavelength range (3700-7000A). We apply
spectral inversion methods to derive 2-dimensional maps of star formation
histories and chemical enrichment. We present maps of the mean (luminosity- and
mass-weighted) age and metallicity that reveal the presence of structures such
as a nuclear ring, previously seen in molecular gas. The disk is dominated in
mass by an old stellar component at all radii sampled by our data, while the
percentage of young stars increase with radius. The mean stellar age and
metallicity profiles have a two defined regions, an inner one with flatter
gradients (even slightly positive) and an external ones with a negative,
steeper one, separated at $\sim$60 arcsec. This break in the profiles is more
prominent in the old stellar component. The young component shows a metallicity
gradient that is very similar to that of the gas, and that is flatter in the
whole disc. The agreement between the metallicity gradient of the young stars
and the gas, and the recovery of the measured colours from our derived star
formation histories validate the techniques to recover the age-metallicity and
the star formation histories in disc galaxies from integrated spectra. We
speculate about the possible origin of the break and conclude that the most
likely scenario is that we are seeing, in the center of NGC 628, a dissolving
bar, as predicted in some numerical simulations.

plays an essential role in the convergence analysis of the numerical

and convergent algorithm to solve the eigenvalue problems of the
Laplace-Beltrami operators acting on functions over discrete surfaces. The
convergence rates of our algorithms of discrete Laplace-Beltrami operators over
surfaces is $O(r^n)$, $n \geq 1$, where $r$ represents the size of the mesh of
discretization of the surface. The problem of high-order accuracies will also
be discussed and used to compute geometric invariants of the underlying
surfaces. Some convergence tests and eigenvalue computations on the sphere,
tori and a dumbbell are presented.

bilayer graphene using the tight-binding approach. We find that in the limit of
large flakes containing zigzag edges the dot-localized energy levels appear
within the energy continuum formed by extended states. As a consequence no
ionization threshold for the carriers contained within the dot exists. For
smaller flakes with zigzag boundaries the dot-localized energy levels appear
interlaced with the energy levels outside the flake, so in a charging
experiment the electrons will be added alternately to the dot area and to its
neighborhood. We demonstrate that for flakes with armchair boundaries only, an
energy window accessible uniquely to the dot-localized states is opened. Then a
number of electrons can be added to the dot before the external states start to
be occupied. We also discuss coupling of the dot-localized states to the edge
states in the context of the valley degeneracy lifting. Moreover, we extract
smooth envelope wave functions from the tight-binding solution and discuss
their spatial symmetries. The coupling of the dot localized energy levels with
reconstructed zigzag edges and atomic vacancies present within the layers is
also considered.

  contribution of Gabrio Piola",,,,,"math.HO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Gabrio Piola's scientific papers have been underestimated in the
mathematical-physics literature. Indeed a careful reading of them proves that
they are original, deep and far reaching. Actually -even if his contribution to
mechanical sciences is not completely ignored- one can undoubtedly say that the
greatest part of his novel contributions to mechanics, although having provided
a great impetus and substantial influence on the work of many preminent
mechanicians, is in fact generally ignored. It has to be remarked that authors
[10] dedicated many efforts to the aim of unveiling the true value of Gabrio
Piola as a scientist; however, some deep parts of his scientific results remain
not yet sufficiently illustrated. Our aim is to prove that non-local and higher
gradient continuum mechanics was conceived already in Piola's works and to try
to explain the reasons of the unfortunate circumstance which caused the erasure
of the memory of this aspect of Piola's contribution. Some relevant
differential relationships obtained in Piola [Piola, 1845-6] are carefully
discussed, as they are still nowadays too often ignored in the continuum
mechanics literature and can be considered the starting point of Levi-Civita's
theory of Connection for Riemannian manifolds.

Based on two formulae of generalized inversion (the first in close analogy to
the inversion of cumulative distribution functions in probability and
statistics, and subsequent re-inversion which in this form seems to be new in
the literature) the technique could prove to be of some importance for the
practical handling of fuzzy intervals whose characterizing functions are
discontinuous and/or not strictly monotonic, e.g. piecewise constant.
Notwithstanding its innovative nature, the article is written in the style of
an introductory textbook featuring a multitude of illustrated examples.

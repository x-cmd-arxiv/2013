the presence of a background electromagnetic field is almost exclusively
limited to a few tractable cases, where the Dirac equation in the corresponding
background field can be solved analytically. This circumstance has restricted,
in particular, the theoretical analysis of QED processes in intense laser
fields to within the plane-wave approximation even at those high intensities,
achievable experimentally only by tightly focusing the laser energy in space.
Here, within the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) or eikonal approximation, we
construct analytically single-particle electron states in the presence of a
background electromagnetic field of general space-time structure in the
realistic assumption that the initial energy of the electron is the largest
dynamical energy scale in the problem. The relatively compact expression of
these states opens, in particular, the possibility of investigating
analytically strong-field QED processes in the presence of spatially focused
laser beams, which is of particular relevance in view of the upcoming
experimental campaigns in this field.

mapping is of the order of the pulsewidth, whereas a spatial resolution of a
few microns is achieved by this optical technique. In addition, this technique
does not suffer from refraction effects due to the steep plasma density
gradients owing to the near-normal incidence of the probe pulse and
consequently, higher harmonics of the probe can be employed to penetrate deeper
into the plasma to even near-solid densities. The spatial and temporal
evolution of the megagauss magnetic fields at the target front as well as at

particle motion within the lattice. The lattice, apart from having a dephasing
effect on single site Landau-Zener transitions, also implies, in the presence
of a confining trap, an inter-site particle flow induced by the Landau-Zener
sweeping. This gives rise to an interplay between intra- and inter-site
dynamics. The adiabaticity constrain is therefor not simply given by the
standard one; the Hamiltonian rate of change relative to the gap of the onsite
problem. In experimentally realistic situations, the full system evolution is
well described by Franck-Condon physics, e.g. non-adiabatic excitations are
predominantly external ones characterized by large phononic vibrations in the
atomic cloud, while internal excitations are very weak as close to perfect

an estimation of the pivot wavelength of 0.64+/-0.01um, at which the cooler

in effective temperature (specifically the Halpha line, TiO and CN bands) have
been used to constrain the stellar parameters. The effective temperatures we

function of the gluon propagator of QCD (in various gauges, as well as for the
gauge-invariant Pinch Technique, or PT, propagator) is not non-negative
everywhere, although it should be if it has a physical interpretation as in
QED. Theory says moreover that the non-positive spectral function of the
Landau-gauge or of the PT gluon propagator is further constrained to obey a
superconvergence relation (the integral of the spectral function vanishes). We
review the theoretical and lattice evidence for violation of positivity as well
as various interpretations of this violation, and consider methods for checking
superconvergence on the lattice (so far undone). The most common interpretation
is that positivity violation implies confinement of gluons, so the gluon
propagator does not describe processes with physical gluons. Another more
direct and gauge-invariant interpretation arises from the PT: Asymptotic
freedom alone demands non-positivity and superconvergence.

assigned a set of discrete time-labels drawn from a set of integers. The labels
of an edge indicate the discrete moments in time at which the edge is
available. We also consider temporal paths in a temporal graph, i.e. paths
whose edges are assigned a strictly increasing sequence of labels. Furthermore,
we assume the uniform case (UNI-CASE), in which every edge of a graph is
assigned exactly one time label from a set of integers and the time labels
assigned to the edges of the graph are chosen randomly and independently, with
the selection following the uniform distribution. We call uniform random
temporal graphs the graphs that satisfy the UNI-CASE. We begin by deriving the
expected number of temporal paths of a given length in the uniform random
temporal clique. We define the term temporal distance of two vertices, which is
the arrival time, i.e. the time-label of the last edge, of the temporal path
that connects those vertices, which has the smallest arrival time amongst all
temporal paths that connect those vertices. We then propose and study two
statistical properties of temporal graphs. One is the maximum expected temporal
distance which is, as the term indicates, the maximum of all expected temporal
distances in the graph. The other one is the temporal diameter which, loosely
speaking, is the expectation of the maximum temporal distance in the graph. We
derive the maximum expected temporal distance of a uniform random temporal star
graph as well as an upper bound on both the maximum expected temporal distance
and the temporal diameter of the normalized version of the uniform random
temporal clique, in which the largest time-label available equals the number of
vertices. Finally, we provide an algorithm that solves an optimization problem
on a specific type of temporal (multi)graphs of two vertices.

D 89, 064062 (2014)","10.1103/PhysRevD.89.064062",,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A shortcoming of current binary black-hole initial data is the generation of
spurious gravitational radiation, so-called junk radiation, when they are
evolved. This problem is a consequence of an oversimplified modeling of the
binary's physics in the initial data. Since junk radiation is not
astrophysically realistic, it contaminates the actual waveforms of interest and
poses a numerical nuisance. The work here presents a further step towards
mitigating and understanding the origin of this issue, by incorporating
post-Newtonian results in the construction of constraint-satisfying binary
black-hole initial data. Here we focus on including realistic tidal
deformations of the black holes in the initial data, by building on the method
of superposing suitably chosen black hole metrics to compute the conformal
data. We describe the details of our initial data for an equal-mass and
nonspinning binary, compute the subsequent relaxation of horizon quantities in
evolutions, and quantify the amount of junk radiation that is generated. These
results are contrasted with those obtained with the most common choice of
conformally flat (CF) initial data, as well as superposed Kerr-Schild (SKS)
initial data. We find that when realistic tidal deformations are included, the
early transients in the horizon geometries are significantly reduced, along
with smaller deviations in the relaxed black hole masses and spins from their
starting values. Likewise, the junk radiation content in the $l=2$ modes is
reduced by a factor of $\sim$1.7 relative to CF initial data, but only by a
factor of $\sim$1.2 relative to SKS initial data. More prominently, the junk
radiation content in the $3\leq l\leq8$ modes is reduced by a factor of $\sim$5
relative to CF initial data, and by a factor of $\sim$2.4 relative to SKS
initial data.

in challenging domains, such as the game of Tetris, no convergence analysis was
provided. The purpose of this paper is to provide such an analysis. We start by
providing a detailed analysis of the Hessian of a Markov Decision Process,
which is formed of a negative-semidefinite component, a positive-semidefinite
component and a remainder term. The first part of our analysis details how the
negative-semidefinite and positive-semidefinite components relate to each
other, and how these two terms contribute to the Hessian. The next part of our
analysis shows that under certain conditions, relating to the richness of the
policy class, the remainder term in the Hessian vanishes in the vicinity of a
local optimum. Finally, we bound the behaviour of this remainder term in terms
of the mixing time of the Markov chain induced by the policy parameters, where
this part of the analysis is applicable over the entire parameter space. Given
this analysis of the Hessian we then provide our local convergence analysis of
the approximate Newton framework.

Compositions of elementary 1-handle movie moves induce a morphism of spectral
sequences. These morphisms remain unexploited in the literature, perhaps
because there is still an open question concerning the naturality of maps
induced by general movies.
  In this paper we focus on the spectral sequences due to Kronheimer-Mrowka

Ozsv\'ath-Szab\'o to the Heegaard-Floer homology of the branched double cover.
For example, we use the 1-handle morphisms to give new information about the
filtrations on the instanton knot Floer homology of the (4,5) torus knot,
determining these up to an ambiguity in a pair of degrees; to determine the
Ozsv\'ath-Szab\'o spectral sequence for an infinite class of prime knots; and

capacity is non-vanishing, allowing for the perfect reconstruction of quantum
information outside of the black hole horizon. We also find that the
complementary channel (transmitting entanglement behind the horizon) is

the quantum capacity of the black hole channel in the limit of a perfectly

of the complementary channel is non-vanishing instead. Rather than inviting a
new crisis for quantum physics, this finding instead is in accordance with the

densities, but the cold gas disk has lower velocity dispersions and reaches
higher rotation velocities. We attribute the warm gas disk to a thick gas layer

observe excess blueshifts of 50km/s in the far side of the galaxy as well as
similar excess redshifts in the near side. These residuals can be interpreted
as due to nuclear inflow in the cold gas, with an estimated ionized gas mass
inflow rate of 2.2 x 10^(-2)Msun/yr. We have also subtracted a rotating model
from the warm disk velocity field and found excess blueshifts of 100km/s to the
SW of the nucleus and excess redshifts of 40km/s to the NE, which we attribute
to gas disturbed by an interaction with a nuclear spherical outflow. This
nuclear outflow is the origin of the nuclear component observed within the
inner 300pc and it has a mass outflow rate of 0.9Msun/yr. In a region between
1"" and 4"" north of the nucleus we find a new low sigma component of ionized gas
which we attribute to a high latitude cloud photoionized by the nuclear source.

satisfactorily the SED, the parameter values that they use result in

energy at $E_{{\rm \nu,peak}} \simeq 100$ PeV. However, the propagation of

this process and we show that the cost of this process is less than it seems
and it depends on a certain cryptographic constant which we estimated to be at
most 1.86. These optimizations enable bitcoin miners to save tens of millions
of dollars per year in electricity bills. Miners who set up mining operations
face many economic incertitudes such as high volatility. In this paper we point
out that there are fundamental incertitudes which depend very strongly on the
bitcoin specification. The energy efficiency of bitcoin miners have already
been improved by a factor of about 10,000, and we claim that further
improvements are inevitable. Better technology is bound to be invented, would
it be quantum miners. More importantly, the specification is likely to change.
A major change have been proposed in May 2013 at Bitcoin conference in San
Diego by Dan Kaminsky. However, any sort of change could be flatly rejected by
the community which have heavily invested in mining with the current
technology. Another question is the reward halving scheme in bitcoin. The
current bitcoin specification mandates a strong 4-year cyclic property. We find
this property totally unreasonable and harmful and explain why and how it needs
to be changed.

relating the 21 cm forest power spectrum to the optical depth power spectrum

as observed by Swift, which had a peak bolometric luminosity of ~6% of the
Eddington limit (L$_{E}$), and give detailed properties of the thermonuclear
burst observed on 2013 April 7. We also present a detailed analysis of new and
archival Chandra data, which we use to study quiescent emission from IGR
J18245-2452 between 2002 and 2013. Together, these observations cover almost
five orders of magnitude in X-ray luminosity (L$_X$, 0.5-10 keV). The Swift
spectrum softens during the outburst decay (photon index $\Gamma$ from 1.3
above L$_X$/L$_{E}$=10$^{-2}$ to ~2.5 at L$_X$/L$_{E}$=10$^{-4}$), similar to
other NS and black hole (BH) transients. At even lower luminosities, deep
Chandra observations reveal hard ($\Gamma$=1-1.5), purely non-thermal and
highly variable X-ray emission in quiescence. We therefore find evidence for a
spectral transition at L$_X$/L$_{E}$~10$^{-4}$, where the X-ray spectral
softening observed during the outburst decline turns into hardening as the
source goes to quiescence. Furthermore, we find a striking variability pattern
in the 2008 Chandra light curves: rapid switches between a high-L$_X$ ""active""
state (L$_X\simeq$3.9x10$^{33}$ erg/s) and a low-L$_X$ ""passive"" state
(L$_X\simeq$5.6x10$^{32}$ erg/s), with no detectable spectral change. We put
our results in the context of low luminosity accretion flows around compact
objects and X-ray emission from millisecond radio pulsars. Finally, we discuss
possible origins for the observed mode switches in quiescence, and explore a
scenario where they are caused by fast transitions between the magnetospheric

magnetic Stokes vectors and force-free field extrapolations, we attribute this
behaviour to the cut-off frequency imposed by the magnetic field geometry in
this location. A rapid, localised inclination of the magnetic field lines in
the north direction results in a faster increase in the dominant periodicity

reveal how the spatial distribution of dominant wave periods, obtained with one
of the highest resolution solar instruments currently available, directly
reflects the magnetic geometry of the underlying sunspot, thus opening up a
wealth of possibilities in future magneto-hydrodynamic seismology studies. In
addition, the intrinsic relationships we find between the underlying magnetic

from High-Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXBs) left behind in stellar binary systems
after the primary forms a black hole (BH), accreting gas at a high rate from
the companion, a process that is thought to be favored at the low metallicities
characteristic of high-redshift gas. Thanks to their large mean free path,
X-rays are capable of preionizing and preheating the gas in the intergalactic
medium (IGM) and in haloes long before the reionization of the Universe is
complete, and thus could have strongly affected the formation of subsequent
generations of stars as well as reionization. We have carried out zoomed
hydrodynamical cosmological simulations of minihaloes, accounting for the
formation of Pop III stars and their collapse into BHs and HMXBs, and the
associated radiation-hydrodynamic feedback from UV and X-ray photons. We find
no strong net feedback from HMXBs on the simulated star formation history. On
the other hand, the preheating of the IGM by HMXBs leads to a strong
suppression of small-scale structures and significantly lowers the
recombination rate in the IGM, thus yielding a net positive feedback on
reionization. We further show that X-ray feedback from HMXBs can augment the
ionizing feedback from the Pop III progenitor stars to suppress gas accretion
onto the first BHs, limiting their growth into supermassive BHs. Finally, we
show that X-ray ionization by HMXBs leaves distinct signatures in the
properties of the high-redshift hydrogen that may be probed in upcoming

distribution at large radii in clusters, while late-time enrichment, favored by
some previous studies, is expected to introduce significant spatial variations
of the metallicity. To discriminate clearly between these competing models, it
is essential to test for potential inhomogeneities by measuring the abundances
out to large radii along multiple directions in clusters, which has not
hitherto been done. Here we report a remarkably uniform measured iron

consistent with a constant value of 0.306+/-0.012 Solar out to the edge of the

Traditionally, template banks for BBH are constructed from intermediary
analytical waveform models which are calibrated against numerical relativity
simulations and which can be aluated for any choice of BBH parameters. This
paper explores an alternative to the traditional approach, namely the
construction of template banks directly from numerical BBH simulations. Using
non-spinning BBH systems as an example, we demonstrate which regions of the
mass-parameter plane can be covered with existing numerical BBH waveforms. We
estimate the required number and required length of BBH simulations to cover
the entire non-spinning BBH parameter plane up to mass-ratio 10, thus
illustrating that our approach can be used to guide parameter placement of
future numerical simulations. We derive error bounds which are independent of
analytical waveform models; therefore, our formalism can be used to
independently test the accuracy of such waveform models. The resulting template
banks are suitable for advanced LIGO searches.

wide variety of compositions, ranging from terrestrial bodies like our own to
more gaseous planets like Neptune. Observations of transiting systems, which
allow us to directly measure planet masses and radii and constrain atmospheric
properties, are key to understanding the compositional diversity of the planets
in this mass range. Although Kepler has discovered hundreds of transiting
super-Earth candidates over the past four years, the majority of these planets
orbit stars that are too far away and too faint to allow for detailed
atmospheric characterization and reliable mass estimates. Ground-based transit
surveys focus on much brighter stars, but most lack the sensitivity to detect
planets in this size range. One way to get around the difficulty of finding
these smaller planets in transit is to start by choosing targets that are
already known to contain super-Earth sized bodies detected using the radial
velocity technique. Here we present results from a Spitzer program to observe
six of the most favorable RV detected super-Earth systems, including HD 1461,
HD 7924, HD 156668, HIP 57274, and GJ 876. We find no evidence for transits in
any of their 4.5 micron flux light curves, and place limits on the allowed
transit depths and corresponding planet radii that rule out even the most dense
and iron-rich compositions for these objects. We also observed HD 97658, but
the observation window was based on a possible ground-based transit detection
(Henry et al. 2011) that was later ruled out; thus the window did not include
the predicted time for the transit detection recently made by MOST (Dragomir et
al. 2013).

Added work on connections with other results",,,,"quant-ph cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of a particular kind of quantum correlation that
arises in some two-party games. In these games, one player is presented with a
question they must answer, yielding an outcome of either 'win' or 'lose'.
Molina and Watrous (arXiv:1104.1140) studied such a game that exhibited a
perfect form of hedging, where the risk of losing a first game can completely
offset the corresponding risk for a second game. This is a non-classical
quantum phenomenon, and establishes the impossibility of performing strong
error-reduction for quantum interactive proof systems by parallel repetition,
unlike for classical interactive proof systems. We take a step in this article
towards a better understanding of the hedging phenomenon by giving a complete
characterization of when perfect hedging is possible for a natural
generalization of the game in arXiv:1104.1140. Exploring in a different
direction the subject of quantum hedging, and motivated by implementation
concerns regarding loss-tolerance, we also consider a variation of the protocol
where the player who receives the question can choose to restart the game
rather than return an answer. We show that in this setting there is no possible
hedging for any game played with state spaces corresponding to
finite-dimensional complex Euclidean spaces.

gametophytes relax epigenetic control of transposable elements (TEs) to promote
production of small RNA that presumably assist nearby reproductive cells in
management of TEs. In light of this possibility, a closer look at the timing of
cell division in relation to angiosperm double fertilization is warranted. From
such an analysis, it is conceivable that double fertilization can drive
angiosperm evolution by facilitating crosses between genetically diverse
parents. A key feature of this ability is the order of cell division following
double fertilization, since division of the primary endosperm nucleus prior to
the zygote would produce small RNA capable of identifying TEs and defining
chromatin states in the zygote prior to its entry into S-phase of the cell
cycle. Consequently, crosses leading to increased ploidy or between genetically
diverse parents would yield offspring better capable of managing a diverse
complement of TEs and repetitive DNA. Considering double fertilization in this
regard challenges previous notions that the primary purpose of endosperm is for
improved seed reserve storage and utilization.

  Elliptic Operators",,,,,"math.AP math.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers how the eigenvalues of the Neumann problem for an
elliptic operator depend on the domain. The proximity of two domains is
measured in terms of the norm of the difference between the two resolvents
corresponding to the reference domain and the perturbed domain, and the size of
eigenfunctions outside the intersection of the two domains. This construction
enables the possibility of comparing both nonsmooth domains and domains with
different topology. An abstract framework is presented, where the main result
is an asymptotic formula where the remainder is expressed in terms of the
proximity quantity described above when this is relatively small. We consider
two applications: the Laplacian in both $C^{1,\alpha}$ and Lipschitz domains.
For the $C^{1,\alpha}$ case, an asymptotic result for the eigenvalues is given
together with estimates for the remainder, and we also provide an example which
demonstrates the sharpness of our obtained result. For the Lipschitz case, the
proximity of eigenvalues is estimated.

considered a central object in the physics of granular materials. However, many
of its features are poorly understood. In particular, analytic relations to
other key macroscopic properties of jammed matter, such as the contact network
and its coordination number, are still lacking. Here we develop a mean-field
theory for this problem, based on the consideration of the contact network as a
random graph where the force transmission becomes a constraint optimization
problem. We can thus use the cavity method developed in the last decades within
the statistical physics of spin glasses and hard computer science problems.
This method allows us to compute the force distribution $\text P(f)$ for random
packings of hard particles of any shape, with or without friction. We find a
new signature of jamming in the small force behavior $\text P(f) \sim
f^{\theta}$, whose exponent has attracted recent active interest: we find a
finite value for $\text P(f=0)$, along with $\theta=0$. Furthermore, we relate
the force distribution to a lower bound of the average coordination number $\,
{\bar z}_{\rm c}^{\rm min}(\mu)$ of jammed packings of frictional spheres with
coefficient $\mu$. This bridges the gap between the two known isostatic limits
$\, {\bar z}_{\rm c}(\mu=0)=2D$ (in dimension $D$) and $\, {\bar z}_{\rm c}(\mu
\to \infty)=D+1$ by extending the naive Maxwell's counting argument to
frictional spheres. The theoretical framework describes different types of
systems, such as non-spherical objects in arbitrary dimensions, providing a
common mean-field scenario to investigate force transmission, contact networks
and coordination numbers of jammed disordered packings.

lightcones. We then explain the Alcubierre Warp Drive, the Morris-Thorne

spacetime curvature which travels along a closed loop in space and time. A
person travelling within the bubble will feel a constant acceleration. A person
outside of the TARDIS will see two bubbles: one which is evolving forwards in
time, and one which is evolving backwards in time. We then discuss the physical
limitations which may prevent us from ever constructing a TARDIS.

harbouring a transiting planet of 1.16 times the size of the Earth and an
orbital period of only 8.5 hours. While the exquisite Kepler photometry was
able to determine its radius and period, the mass of the planet (and thus its
mean density) remained unconstrained in the absence of precise radial-velocity
measurements. Here we present an accurate mass measurement of Kepler-78b using
the HARPS-N spectrograph, recently installed on the Telescopio Nazionale
Galileo (INAF) at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory, La Palma, Spain.
These new data yield a mass of 1.86 Earth masses. The resulting mean density of
the planet is 5.57 grams per cubic centimetre, which is similar to that of the
Earth and implies a composition of iron and rock. Kepler-78b, which orbits a
Sun-like star called Kepler 78 located in the Cygnus constellation at a
distance of about 400 light years from us, is now the smallest exoplanet for
which both the mass and radius are known accurately.

evolutionary forces is introgression, which is the integration of genetic
material from one species into the genome of an individual in another species.
The evolution of several groups of eukaryotic species has involved
hybridization, and cases of adaptation through introgression have been already
established. In this work, we report on a new comparative genomic framework for
detecting introgression in genomes, called PhyloNet-HMM, which combines
phylogenetic networks, that capture reticulate evolutionary relationships among
genomes, with hidden Markov models (HMMs), that capture dependencies within
genomes. A novel aspect of our work is that it also accounts for incomplete
lineage sorting and dependence across loci.
  Application of our model to variation data from chromosome 7 in the mouse
(Mus musculus domesticus) genome detects a recently reported adaptive
introgression event involving the rodent poison resistance gene Vkorc1, in
addition to other newly detected introgression regions. Based on our analysis,
it is estimated that about 12% of all sites withinchromosome 7 are of
introgressive origin (these cover about 18 Mbp of chromosome 7, and over 300
genes). Further, our model detects no introgression in two negative control
data sets. Our work provides a powerful framework for systematic analysis of
introgression while simultaneously accounting for dependence across sites,
point mutations, recombination, and ancestral polymorphism.

they often feed. Treating ice as a viscous shear-thinning power law fluid, we
develop an asymptotic (late-time) theory in two cases $-$ the presence or
absence of contact with sidewalls. The solution without sidewalls is a simple
generalisation of that found by Robison (JFM, 648, 363), allowing us to obtain
the equilibrium grounding line thickness using a simple computer model and to
get an analytic approximation. For laterally confined shelves, we obtain an
asymptotic theory valid for long shelves and define when this is. Our theory is
based on the velocity profile across the channel being a generalised version of
Poiseuille flow, which works when lateral shear dominates the force balance.
  We conducted experiments using a laboratory model for ice. This was an
aqueous suspension of $0.5\%$ mass concentration xanthan, yielding $n \approx
3.8$ (similar to ice). Our theories agreed extremely well with our experiments
for all relevant parameters (front position, thickness profile, lateral
velocity profile, longitudinal velocity gradient and grounding line thickness).
This strongly suggests that we have understood the dominant force balance in
both types of ice shelf.
  In the real world, ice tongues are unlikely to rapidly disintegrate but can
be shortened until they no longer exist, at which point the sheet becomes
unstable and ultimately the grounding line should retreat above sea level.
Prior to that point, the flow of ice into it should not be speeded up and the
grounding line should also not retreat, assuming that only oceanic conditions
change. However, laterally confined ice shelves experience significant
buttressing. If removed, this leads to a rapid speedup of the sheet and a much
smaller equilibrium grounding line thickness. Something similar may have
occurred to the Larsen B ice shelf.

constructed that have topologically ordered ground states. For a long time,
however, it has been difficult to realize Anderson's original vision in such
solvable models, according to which the ground state has an unbroken SU(2) spin
rotational symmetry and is dominated by fluctuation of singlet bonds. The
kagome lattice is the simplest lattice geometry for which parent Hamiltonians
stabilizing a prototypical spin-1/2 short-ranged RVB wave function has been
constructed and strong evidence has been given that this state belongs to a
topological phase. The uniqueness of the desired RVB-type ground states has,
however, not been rigorously proven for the simplest possible such Hamiltonian,
which acts on 12 spins at a time. Rather, this uniqueness has been demonstrated
for a longer ranged (19-site) variant of this Hamiltonian by Schuch et al., via
making contact with powerful results for projected entangled-pair states. In
this paper, we extend this result to the 12-site Hamiltonian. Our result is

fundamentally on their solid-state microstructure. For example, the
molecular-weight distribution influences polymeric- semiconductor properties
via diverse microstructures; polymers of low weight-average molecular weight
(Mw) form unconnected, extended-chain crystals, usually of a paraffinic
structure. Because of the non-entangled nature of the relatively short-chain
macromolecules, this leads to a polycrystalline, one-phase morphology. In
contrast, with high-Mw materials, where average chain lengths are longer than
the length between entanglements, two-phase morphologies, comprised of
crystalline moieties embedded in largely unordered (amorphous) regions, are
obtained. We investigate charge photogeneration processes in neat regioregular
poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) of varying Mw by means of time-resolved
photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. At 10 K, PL originating from recombination
of long-lived charge pairs decays over microsecond timescales. Both the
amplitude and decay rate distribution depend strongly on Mw. In films with
dominant one-phase chain-extended microstructures, the delayed PL is suppressed
as a result of a diminished yield of photoinduced charges, and its decay is
significantly faster than in two-phase microstructures. However, independent of
Mw, charge recombination regenerates singlet excitons in torsionally disordered
chains forming more strongly coupled photophysical aggregates than those in the
steady-state ensemble, with delayed PL lineshape reminiscent of that in
paraffinic morphologies at steady state. We conclude that highly delocalized
excitons in disordered regions between crystalline and amorphous phases
dissociate extrinsically with yield and spatial distribution that depend
intimately upon microstructure.

at high-resolution and high-cadence making it well suited to study the dynamics
of quiescent prominences. In recent years it has become clear that quiescent
prominences support small-amplitude transverse oscillations, however, sample
sizes are usually too small for general conclusions to be drawn. We remedy this
by providing a statistical study of transverse oscillations in vertical
prominence threads. Over a three-hour period of observations it was possible to
measure the properties of 3436 waves, finding periods from 50 to 6000 s with
typical velocity amplitudes ranging between 0.2 to 23 km s$^{-1}$. The large
number of observed waves allows the determination of the frequency dependence
of the wave properties and derivation of the velocity power spectrum for the
transverse waves. For frequencies less than 7 mHz, the frequency-dependence of
the velocity power is consistent with the velocity power spectra generated from
observations of the horizontal motions of magnetic elements in the photosphere,
suggesting that the prominence transverse waves are driven by photospheric
motions. However, at higher frequencies the two distributions significantly
diverge, with relatively more power found at higher frequencies in the
prominence oscillations. These results highlight that waves over a large
frequency range are ubiquitous in prominences, and that a significant amount of
the wave energy is found at higher frequency.

chain in terms of the absolute spectral gap and the number of elements in the

bound is finite whenever the chain converges. The dependence on the number of
elements means that the new bound cannot capture the behavior of rapidly mixing
chains; but an example shows that such dependence is necessary. We also provide
a sharpened result for reversible chains that are not necessarily irreducible.
The proof of the general bound exploits a connection between linear recurrence
relations and Schur functions due to Hou and Mu, while the sharpened bound for
reversible chains arises as a consequence of the stochastic interpretation of
eigenvalues developed by Diaconis, Fill, and Miclo. In particular, for every

function of the Hubbard model. In the limit of extreme correlations, where the
onsite interaction is infinite, the evaluation of diagrams simplifies
dramatically enabling us to carry out the expansion to the eighth order in
powers of the hopping amplitude. We compute the finite-temperature Green's
function analytically in the momentum and Matsubara frequency space as a
function of the electron density. Employing Pade approximations, we study the
equation of state, Kelvin thermopower, momentum distribution function,
quasiparticle fraction, and quasiparticle lifetime of the system at
temperatures lower than, or of the order of, the hopping amplitude. We also
discuss several different approaches for obtaining the spectral functions
through analytic continuation of the imaginary frequency Green's function, and
show results for the system near half filling. We benchmark our results for the
equation of state against those obtained from a numerical linked-cluster
expansion carried out to the eleventh order.

variability in intensity and velocity with time scales of a month or shorter.
Four methanol emission sources were detected, and those in the OMC 2 FIR 3/4

other two sources in the NGC 2071 IRS 1-3 and V380 Ori NE regions are probably

protostars are rarely detectable. The methanol class I maser of low-mass
protostars is an even rarer phenomenon, with a detection rate much smaller than
1%.

with previous radio interferometric observations of this galaxy, no new sources
were discovered. By combining the results of this survey with Very Large Array
observations at higher frequencies from the literature, spectra were derived
and a free-free absorption model was fitted of 20 known sources in NGC 253. The
results were found to be consistent with previous studies. The supernova
remnant, 5.48-43.3, was imaged with the highest sensitivity and resolution to
date, revealing a two-lobed morphology. Comparisons with previous observations
of similar resolution give an upper limit of 10,000 km/s for the expansion
speed of this remnant. We derive a supernova rate of <0.2 per yr for the inner
300 pc using a model that improves on previous methods by incorporating an
improved radio supernova peak luminosity distribution and by making use of
multi-wavelength radio data spanning 21 years. A star formation rate of SFR(M>5
M_solar)<4.9 M_solar per yr was also estimated using the standard relation
between supernova and star-formation rates. Our improved estimates of supernova

results of our study point to the possible existence of a small population of

three flux ropes, they rose up with a velocity of less than 30 km s$^{-1}$
after their appearances, and subsequently their intensities at 131 {\AA}
decreased and the flux ropes became obscure. The fourth flux rope erupted
ultimately with a speed of about 130 km s$^{-1}$ and formed a coronal mass
ejection. The associated filament showed an obvious anti-clockwise twist motion
at the initial stage, and the twist was estimated at 4$\pi$. This indicates
that kink instability possibly triggers the early rise of the fourth flux rope.
The activated filament material was spatially within the flux rope and they
showed consistent evolution in their early stages. Our findings provide new
clues for understanding the characteristics of flux ropes. Firstly, there are
multiple flux ropes that are successively formed at the same location during an
AR evolution process. Secondly, a slow-rise flux rope does not necessarily
result in a CME, and a fast-eruption flux rope results in a CME.

marginally closed. In this case, there arises a relation that closes the system
of equations for perturbations on the brane. Perturbations of pressureless
matter and dark radiation can now be described by a system of coupled
second-order differential equations. Remarkably, this system can be exactly
solved in the matter-dominated and de Sitter regimes. In this case, apart from
the usual growing and decaying modes, we find two additional modes that behave
monotonically on super-Hubble spatial scales and exhibit rapid oscillations
with decaying amplitude on sub-Hubble spatial scales.

electrical transport and magnetic properties of the two series of samples were
compared. The corrected resistivity at 40K, Rho A(40K), is higher for the SiC
reacted samples regardless of carbon (C) substitution level, indicating larger
intragrain scattering because of the simultaneous reaction between Mg and SiC
and carbon substitution during the formation of MgB2. In addition, because of
the cleaner reaction route for the SiC reacted samples, the calculated active
area that carries current, AF, is twice that of the (Si+C) samples. On the
other hand, the upper critical field, Hc2, was similar for both sets of samples
despite their different C substitution levels which proves the importance of
defect scattering in addition to C substitution level. Hence, the form of the
precursor reactants is critical for tuning the form of Hc2(T).

the real-space Kubo-Greenwood method implemented on graphics processing units.
Two models of short-range disorder, namely, the Anderson on-site disorder model
and the vacancy defect model, are considered. For graphene with Anderson
disorder, localization lengths of quasi-one-dimensional systems with various
disorder strengths, edge symmetries, and boundary conditions are calculated
using the real-space Kubo-Greenwood formalism, showing excellent agreement with
independent transfer matrix calculations and superior computational efficiency.
Using these data, we demonstrate the applicability of the one-parameter scaling
theory of localization length and propose an analytical expression for the
scaling function, which provides a reliable method of computing the
two-dimensional localization length. This method is found to be consistent with
another widely used method which relates the two-dimensional localization
length to the elastic mean free path and the semiclassical conductivity.
Abnormal behavior at the charge neutrality point is identified and interpreted
to be caused by finite-size effects when the system width is comparable to or
smaller than the elastic mean free path. We also demonstrate the finite-size
effect when calculating the two-dimensional conductivity in the localized
regime and show that a renormalization group beta function consistent with the
one-parameter scaling theory can be extracted numerically. For graphene with
vacancy disorder, we show that the proposed scaling function of localization
length also applies. Lastly, we discuss some ambiguities in calculating the
semiclassical conductivity around the charge neutrality point due to the
presence of resonant states.

the phase of the transmitted microwave signal. In addition, we illustrate the
effect of the electronic degrees of freedom on the photon field, giving rise to
non-linearities, damping and dissipation, and discuss how to control these
effects by means of gate and bias voltages.

Lanzhou quantum molecular dynamics (LQMD) transport model. The kaon
(anti-kaon)-nucleon and hyperon-nucleon potentials in dense nuclear matter are
implemented in the model, which are computed from the chiral perturbation
approach and the relativistic mean-field model, respectively. It is found that
the in-medium potentials change the structure of transverse flow, and also
affect the rapidity distributions and the inclusive spectra for strangeness
production. The local temperature of the fire ball extracted from the kaon
spectra of inclusive invariant cross sections is influenced by the kaon-nucleon
potential. The stiffness of nuclear symmetry energy and the kaon-nucleon
potential by distinguishing isospin effect play a significant role on the ratio
of K$^{0}$/K$^{+}$, in particular at the subthreshold energies. The ratio of
$\Sigma^{-}/\Sigma^{+}$ depends on the high-density symmetry energy, in which
the $\Sigma$-nucleon potential has a neglectable contribution on the isospin

to search for submillimeter molecular emission from the T Cha disk, and we
reanalyzed archival XMM-Newton spectroscopy of T Cha to ascertain the
intervening absorption due to disk gas along the line of sight to the star
(N_H). We detected submillimeter rotational transitions of 12CO, 13CO, HCN, CN
and HCO+ from the T Cha disk. The 12CO line appears to display a double-peaked
line profile indicative of Keplerian rotation. Analysis of the CO emission line
data indicates that the disk around T Cha has a mass (M_disk,H_2 = 80 M_earth)
similar to, but more compact (R_disk, CO~80 AU) than, other nearby, evolved
molecular disks (e.g. V4046 Sgr, TW Hya, MP Mus) in which cold molecular gas
has been previously detected. The HCO+/13CO and HCN/13CO, line ratios measured
for T Cha appear similar to those of other evolved circumstellar disks (i.e. TW
Hya and V4046 Sgr), while the CN/13CO ratio appears somewhat weaker. Analysis
of the XMM-Newton data shows that the atomic absorption $N_H$ toward T Cha is
1-2 orders of magnitude larger than toward the other nearby T Tauri with
evolved disks. Furthermore, the ratio between atomic absorption and optical
extinction N_H/A_V toward T Cha is higher than the typical value observed for
the interstellar medium and young stellar objects in the Orion Nebula Cluster.
This may suggest that the fraction of metals in the disk gas is higher than in
the interstellar medium. Our results confirm that pre-main sequence stars older
than ~5 Myr, when accreting, retain cold molecular disks, and that those
relatively evolved disks display similar physical and chemical properties.

one in which the basal species uses detritus as a food resource. While the vast
majority of theoretical studies neglects detritus, from our results it follows
that the detrital food web is more stable than its grazing counterpart, because
the interactions mediated by detritus damp out fluctuations in species'
densities. Since the detritus model is the more complex one in terms of
interaction patterns, our results provide new evidence for the advocates of the
complexity as one of the factors enhancing stability of ecosystems.

situation hampered by the struggle of observational approaches in conclusively
identifying the presence, or not, of dark matter in these systems. In this
paper, we address this question through an analysis of the particular case of
NGC 6809. While previous studies have performed dynamical modeling of this
globular cluster using a small number of available kinematic data, they did not
perform appropriate statistical inference tests for the choice of best model
description; such statistical inference for model selection is important since,
in general, different models can result in significantly different inferred
quantities. With the latest kinematic data, we use Bayesian inference tests for
model selection and thus obtain the best fitting models, as well as mass and
dynamic mass-to-light ratio estimates. For this, we introduce a new likelihood
function that provides more constrained distributions for the defining
parameters of dynamical models. Initially we consider models with a known
distribution function, and then model the cluster using solutions of the
spherically symmetric Jeans equation; this latter approach depends upon the
mass density profile and anisotropy $\beta$ parameter. In order to find the
best description for the cluster we compare these models by calculating their
Bayesian evidence. We find smaller mass and dynamic mass-to-light ratio values
than previous studies, with the best fitting Michie model for a constant
mass-to-light ratio of $\Upsilon = 0.90^{+0.14}_{-0.14}$ and
$M_{\text{dyn}}=6.10^{+0.51}_{-0.88} \times 10^4 M_{\odot}$. We exclude the
significant presence of dark matter throughout the cluster, showing that no
physically motivated distribution of dark matter can be present away from the
cluster core.

that finite temperature effects in the superfluid core of a neutron star lead
to a resonance coupling and enhanced damping (and hence stability) of
oscillation modes at certain stellar temperatures. Using a simple
phenomenological model we demonstrate that neutron stars with high spin
frequency may spend a substantial amount of time at these `resonance'

rapidly rotating neutron stars in LMXBs and to predict a new class of hot,
non-accreting, rapidly rotating neutron stars, some of which may have already
been observed and tentatively identified as quiescent LMXB (qLMXB) candidates.
We also impose a new theoretical limit on the neutron star spin frequency,
explaining the cut-off spin frequency ~730 Hz, following from the statistical
analysis of accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars. Besides explaining the
observations, our model provides a new tool to constrain superdense matter
properties comparing measured and theoretically predicted resonance

singly ionized magnesium (MgII). We measure the MgI atmospheric absorption to
be 6.2+/-2.9% in the velocity range from -62 to -19 km/s. The detection of
atomic magnesium in the planetary upper atmosphere at a distance of several
planetary radii gives a first view into the transition region between the
thermosphere and the exobase, where atmospheric escape takes place. We estimate
the electronic densities needed to compensate for the photo-ionization by
dielectronic recombination of Mg+ to be in the range of 10^8-10^9 cm^{-3}. Our
finding is in excellent agreement with model predictions at altitudes of
several planetary radii.
  We observe MgI atoms escaping the planet, with a maximum radial velocity (in
the stellar rest frame) of -60 km/s. Because magnesium is much heavier than
hydrogen, the escape of this species confirms previous studies that the
planet's atmosphere is undergoing hydrodynamic escape. We compare our
observations to a numerical model that takes the stellar radiation pressure on
the MgI atoms into account. We find that the MgI atoms must be present at up to
~7.5 planetari radii altitude and estimate an MgI escape rate of ~3x10^7 g/s.
Compared to previous evaluations of the escape rate of HI atoms, this
evaluation is compatible with a magnesium abundance roughly solar. A hint of
absorption, detected at low level of significance, during the post-transit
observations, could be interpreted as a MgI cometary-like tail. If true, the
estimate of the absorption by MgI would be increased to a higher value of about
8.8+/-2.1%.

dynamical environment where mass flows and jets are frequently observed. These
jets are believed to be important for the coronal heating and the acceleration
of the fast solar wind. We studied the dynamics of two jets seen in a polar
coronal hole with a combination of imaging from EIS and XRT onboard Hinode. We
observed drift motions related to the evolution and formation of these
small-scale jets, which we tried to model as well. We found observational
evidence that supports the idea that polar jets are very likely produced by
multiple small-scale reconnections occurring at different times in different
locations. These eject plasma blobs that flow up and down with a motion very
similar to a simple ballistic motion. The associated drift speed of the first
jet is estimated to be $\approx$ 27 km s$^{-1}$. The average outward speed of
the first jet is $\approx 171$ km s$^{-1}$, well below the escape speed, hence
if simple ballistic motion is considered, the plasma will not escape the Sun.
The second jet was observed in the south polar coronal hole with three XRT
filters, namely, C$_{-}$poly, Al$_{-}$poly, and Al$_{-}$mesh filters. We
observed that the second jet drifted at all altitudes along the jet with the
same drift speed of $\simeq$ 7 km s$^{-1}$. The enhancement in the light curves
of low-temperature EIS lines in the later phase of the jet lifetime and the
shape of the jet's stack plots suggests that the jet material is falls back,
and most likely cools down. To support this conclusion, the observed drifts
were interpreted within a scenario where reconnection progressively shifts
along a magnetic structure, leading to the sequential appearance of jets of
about the same size and physical characteristics. On this basis, we also
propose a simple qualitative model that mimics the observations.

interest in the quantum gravity community over the last eight years. It was
first observed in computer simulations of the causal dynamical triangulation
(CDT) approach to quantum gravity and refers to the reduction of the spectral
dimension from 4 at classical scales to 2 at short distances. Thereafter
several authors confirmed a similar result from different approaches to quantum
gravity. Despite the contribution from different approaches, no analytical
model was proposed to explain the numerical results as the continuum limit of
CDT. In this thesis we introduce graph ensembles as toy models of CDT and show
that both the continuum limit and a scale dependent spectral dimension can be
defined rigorously. First we focus on a simple graph ensemble, the random comb.
It does not have any dynamics from the gravity point of view, but serves as an
instructive toy model to introduce the characteristic scale of the graph, study
the continuum limit and define the scale dependent spectral dimension. Having
defined the continuum limit, we study the reduction of the spectral dimension
on more realistic toy models, the multigraph ensembles, which serve as a radial
approximation of CDT. We focus on the (recurrent) multigraph approximation of
the two-dimensional CDT whose ensemble measure is analytically controlled. The
latter comes from the critical Galton-Watson process conditioned on
non-extinction. Next we turn our attention to transient multigraph ensembles,
corresponding to higher-dimensional CDT. Firstly we study their fractal
properties and secondly calculate the scale dependent spectral dimension and
compare it to computer simulations. We comment further on the relation between
Horava-Lifshitz gravity, asymptotic safety, multifractional spacetimes and
CDT-like models.

SNM is made by extracting the lowest density $\rho_{\text{crit}}$ at which a
pole appears at zero energy in the RPA response function when employing the
critical value of the coupling constant $C^{\rho \Delta\rho}_{1}$ extracted in
nuclei. Our analysis suggests a two-fold stability criterion to avoid
scalar-isovector instabilities: (i) The density $\rho_{\text{min}}$
corresponding to the lowest pole in the RPA response function should be larger
than about 1.2 times the saturation density; (ii) one needs to verify that
$\rho_{p}(q_{\text{pq}})$ exhibits a distinct global minimum and is not a
decreasing function for large transferred momenta.

CNFs is an important task in AI. This paper provides new results along this
research line and presents new algorithms for performing minimal model finding
and checking over positive propositional CNFs and model minimization over
propositional CNFs. An algorithmic schema, called the Generalized Elimination
Algorithm (GEA) is presented, that computes a minimal model of any positive
CNF. The schema generalizes the Elimination Algorithm (EA) [BP97], which
computes a minimal model of positive head-cycle-free (HCF) CNF theories. While
the EA always runs in polynomial time in the size of the input HCF CNF, the
complexity of the GEA depends on the complexity of the specific eliminating
operator invoked therein, which may in general turn out to be exponential.
Therefore, a specific eliminating operator is defined by which the GEA
computes, in polynomial time, a minimal model for a class of CNF that strictly
includes head-elementary-set-free (HEF) CNF theories [GLL06], which form, in
their turn, a strict superset of HCF theories. Furthermore, in order to deal
with the high complexity associated with recognizing HEF theories, an
""incomplete"" variant of the GEA (called IGEA) is proposed: the resulting
schema, once instantiated with an appropriate elimination operator, always
constructs a model of the input CNF, which is guaranteed to be minimal if the
input theory is HEF. In the light of the above results, the main contribution
of this work is the enlargement of the tractability frontier for the minimal
model finding and checking and the model minimization problems.

non-trivial coupling between adiabatic and entropic fields, and where an
unstable potential is not required. In the model nearly scale-invariant entropy
perturbations are generated first. Remarkably, we find that the bispectrum of
these perturbations vanishes, with the values of the non-Gaussianity parameters

entropy perturbations can be converted into curvature perturbations by a
variety of mechanisms. The bispectrum of the curvature perturbations depends on
the non-linearity of the conversion process and is thus more model-dependent -
however, for an efficient conversion process the final bispectrum remains
small. The only distinguishing feature compared to single-field slow-roll
inflationary models is an absence of primordial gravitational waves. Thus the

temperature. In contrast with quasi-one-dimensional systems, the resistivity
anomaly associated with the CDW transition is strong in the direction
perpendicular to the CDW wave vector Q (a-axis) and very weak in the CDW wave
vector Q direction (c-axis). We qualitatively explain this result by
calculating the electrical conductivity for the electron dispersion with
momentum-dependent CDW gap as determined by angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES).

enigma. Here we experimentally demonstrate a mechanism where time-lags among
neuronal spiking leap from several tens of milliseconds to nearly zero-lag
synchrony. It also allows sudden leaps out of synchrony, hence forming short
epochs of synchrony. Our results are based on an experimental procedure where
conditioned stimulations were enforced on circuits of neurons embedded within a
large-scale network of cortical cells in vitro and are corroborated by
simulations of neuronal populations. The underlying biological mechanisms are
the unavoidable increase of the neuronal response latency to ongoing
stimulations and temporal or spatial summation required to generate evoked
spikes. These sudden leaps in and out of synchrony may be accompanied by
multiplications of the neuronal firing frequency, hence offering reliable
information-bearing indicators which may bridge between the two principal
neuronal coding paradigms.

with a fast independent component analysis (fastica) technique. We present the
power spectrum of the large-scale matter distribution, C(l), before and after
the application of this foreground removal method and calculate the resulting
systematic errors. We attempt to reduce systematics in the foreground
subtraction by optimally masking the maps to remove high foregrounds in the
Galactic plane. Our simulations show a certain level of bias remains in the
power spectrum at all scales l<400. At large-scales l<30 this bias is
particularly significant. We measure the impact of these systematic effects in
two different ways: firstly we fit cosmological parameters to the broadband
shape of the power spectrum and secondly we extract the position of the Baryon
Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). In the first analysis, we find that the
systematics introduce an significant shift in the best fit cosmological
parameters at the 2 to 3 sigma level which depends on the masking and noise
levels. However, cosmic distances can be recovered in an unbiased way after
foreground removal at all simulated redshifts by fitting the BAOs in the power
spectrum. We conclude that further advances in foreground removal are needed in

finite boundary dramatically faster than a classical walker and that this

measurements consist on a mixed-effects model to fit longitudinal trajectories
whose random effects enter as covariates in a generalized linear model for the
primary response. They provide a useful way to asses association between these
two kinds of data, which in clinical studies are often collected jointly on a
series of individuals and may help understanding, for instance, the mechanisms
of recovery of a certain disease or the efficacy of a given therapy. The most
common joint model in this framework is based on a linear mixed model for the
longitudinal data. However, for complex datasets the linearity assumption may
be too restrictive. Some works have considered generalizing this setting with
the use of a nonlinear mixed-effects model for the longitudinal trajectories
but the proposed estimation procedures based on likelihood approximations have
been shown De la Cruz et al. (2011) to exhibit some computational efficiency
problems. In this article we propose an MCMC-based estimation procedure in the
joint model with a nonlinear mixed-effects model for the longitudinal data and
a generalized linear model for the primary response. Moreover, we consider that
the errors in the longitudinal model may be correlated. We apply our method to

(GC) region by cosmic rays in dense molecular clouds (MCs) and in the diffuse

several years in the direction of the cloud Srg B2. If this emission is
produced by low energy CRs which ionize the interstellar molecular gas the
intensity of the line is quite small, < 1%. However, we cannot exclude that
local sources of CRs or X-ray photons nearby the cloud may provide much higher
intensity of the line from there. Production of the line emission from
molecular clouds depends strongly on processes of CR penetration into them. We
show that turbulent motions of neutral gas may generate strong magnetic
fluctuations in the clouds which prevent free penetration of CRs into the
clouds from outside. We provide a special analysis of the line production by
high energy electrons. We concluded that these electrons hardly provide the
diffuse 6.4 keV line emission from the GC because their density is depleted by
ionization losses. We do not exclude that local sources of electrons may
provide an excesses of the 6.4 keV line emission in some molecular clouds and
even reproduce a relatively short time variations of the iron line emission.
However, we doubt whether a single electron source provides the simultaneous
short time variability of the iron line emission from clouds which are distant
from each other on hundred pc as observed for the GC clouds. An alternative
speculation is that local electron sources could also provide the necessary
effect of the line variations in different clouds that are seen simultaneously
by chance that seems, however, very unlikely.

3D anelastic simulations of rotating convection for global models with
stratification resembling the solar interior. The numerical method is based on
an implicit large-eddy simulation approach designed to capture effects from
non-resolved small scales. We obtain two regimes of differential rotation, with
equatorial zonal flows accelerated either in the direction of rotation
(solar-like) or in the opposite direction (anti-solar). While the models with
the solar-like differential rotation tend to produce multiple cells of
meridional circulation, the models with anti-solar differential rotation result
in only one or two meridional cells. Our simulations indicate that the rotation
and large-scale flow patterns critically depend on the ratio between buoyancy
and Coriolis forces. By including a subadiabatic layer at the bottom of the
domain, corresponding to the stratification of a radiative zone, we reproduce a
layer of strong radial shear similar to the solar tachocline. Similarly,
enhanced superadiabaticity at the top results in a near-surface shear layer
located mainly at lower latitudes. The models reveal a latitudinal entropy
gradient localized at the base of the convection zone and in the stable region,
which however does not propagate across the convection zone. In consequence,
baroclinicity effects remain small and the rotation iso-contours align in
cylinders along the rotation axis. Our results confirm the alignment of large
convective cells along the rotation axis in the deep convection zone, and
suggest that such ""banana-cell"" pattern can be hidden beneath the

single Yb+ ion confined in a Paul trap and two caesium fountains as references.
In one of the fountains, the frequency of the microwave oscillator that
interrogates the caesium atoms is stabilized by the laser that excites the Yb+
reference transition with a linewidth in the hertz range. The stability is
transferred to the microwave oscillator with the use of a fiber laser based
optical frequency comb generator that also provides the frequency conversion
for the absolute frequency measurement. The frequency comb generator is
configured as a transfer oscillator so that fluctuations of the pulse
repetition rate and of the carrier offset frequency do not degrade the
stability of the frequency conversion. The phase noise level of the generated
ultrastable microwave signal is comparable to that of a cryogenic sapphire
oscillator. For fountain operation with optical molasses loaded from a laser
cooled atomic beam source, we obtain a stability corresponding to a fractional
Allan deviation of $4.1\times 10^{-14}\ (\tau/\text{s})^{-1/2}$. With the
molasses loaded from thermal vapor and an averaging time of 65 h, we measure
the frequency of the Yb+ transition with a relative statistical uncertainty of
$2.8\times10^{-16}$ and a systematic uncertainty of $5.9\times10^{-16}$. The
frequency was also simultaneously measured with the second fountain that uses a
quartz-based interrogation oscillator. The unperturbed frequency of the Yb+
transition is realized with an uncertainty of $1.1\times10^{-16}$ that mainly
results from the uncertainty of the blackbody shift at the operating
temperature near 300 K. The transition frequency of 688 358 979 309 307.82(36)

Exploration at 20 cm (mJIVE-20). mJIVE-20 is a large project on the Very Long
Baseline Array which uses ""filler"" time to systematically inspect a large
sample of mJy radio sources, pre-selected from the FIRST survey made with the
Very Large Array, to identify any compact emission which may be present. The
newly available multifield capability of the VLBA makes it possible for us to
inspect of order 100 sources per hour of observing time with a 6.75 sigma
detection sensitivity of approximately 1 mJy/beam. The results of the mJIVE-20
survey are made publicly available as soon as the data are calibrated. After 18
months of observing, over 20,000 FIRST sources have been inspected, with 4,336
VLBI detections. These initial results suggest that within the range 1 - 200
mJy, fainter sources are somewhat more likely to be dominated by a very compact
component than brighter sources. Over half of all arcsecond-scale mJy radio
sources contain a compact component, although the fraction of sources which are
dominated by milliarcsecond scale structure is smaller at 30-35%, increasing
towards lower flux densities. Significant differences are seen depending on the
optical classification of the source. Radio sources with a stellar/point-like
counterpart in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) are more likely to be
detected overall, but this detection likelihood appears to be independent of
the arcsecond-scale radio flux density; the trend towards higher radio
compactness for fainter sources is confined to SDSS galaxies and
non-detections. These results are consistent with a unification model of AGN in
which less luminous sources have on average slower radio jets, with lower
Doppler suppression of compact core emission over a wider range of viewing
angles. (abridged)

X-ray emitting coronae, their open wind-bearing magnetic fields, and the
geometry of magnetospheric accretion flows. The magnetic fields of all the
CTTSs are multipolar. Stars with simpler (more dipolar) large-scale magnetic
fields have stronger fields, are slower rotators, and have larger X-ray
emitting coronae compared to stars with more complex large-scale magnetic
fields. The field complexity controls the distribution of open and closed field
regions across the stellar surface, and strongly influences the location and
shapes of accretion hot spots. However, the higher order field components are
of secondary importance in determining the total unsigned open magnetic flux,
which depends mainly on the strength of the dipole component and the stellar
surface area. Likewise, the dipole component alone provides an adequate
approximation of the disc truncation radius. For some stars, the pressure of
the hot coronal plasma dominates the stellar magnetic pressure and forces open
the closed field inside the disc truncation radius. This is significant as
accretion models generally assume that the magnetic field has a closed geometry
out to the inner disc edge.

region (AR) sigmoid in AR 11283 from 2011 September 4 to 6. To follow the
quasi-static evolution of the coronal magnetic field, we reconstruct a time
sequence of static fields using a recently developed nonlinear force-free field
model constrained by the SDO/HMI vector magnetograms. A detailed analysis of
the fields compared with the SDO/AIA observations suggests the following
scenario for the evolution of the region. Initially, a new bipole emerges into
the negative polarity of a pre-existing bipolar AR, forming a null point
topology between the two flux systems. A weakly twisted flux rope (FR) is then
built up slowly in the embedded core region, largely through flux-cancellation
photospheric reconnections, forming a bald patch separatrix surface (BPSS)
separating the FR from its ambient field. The FR grows gradually until its axis
runs into a torus instability (TI) domain near the end of the third day, and
the BPSS also develops a fully S-shape. Unlike in the case of standard TI, the
FR does not erupt instantly since it is still attached at the photosphere along
the bald patch (BP) portion of the polarity inversion line. The combined
effects of the TI-driven expansion of the FR and the line-tying at the BP tear
the FR into two parts with the upper portion freely expelled and the lower
portion remaining behind the post-flare arcades. This process dynamically
perturbs the BPSS and results in the transient enhanced brightening of the
sigmoid. The accelerated expansion of the upper portion of the FR strongly
pushes its envelope flux near the null point and triggers breakout reconnection
at the null, as evidenced by a remarkable circular flare ribbon, which further
facilitates the eruption. We discuss the important implications of these
results for the formation and disruption of sigmoid region with FR.

fluid under the expansion-free condition, which requires the existence of
vacuum cavity within the fluid distribution. We have discussed two family of
solutions which further provide two exact models in each family. Some of these
solutions satisfy Darmois junction condition while some show the presence of
thin shell on both boundary surfaces. We also formulate a relation between the
Weyl tensor and energy density.

  Network Statistics and Metrics","ASONAM 2012, Istanbul : Turkey (2012)",,,,"cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The modern age has seen an exponential growth of social network data
available on the web. Analysis of these networks reveal important structural
information about these networks in particular and about our societies in
general. More often than not, analysis of these networks is concerned in
identifying similarities among social networks and how they are different from
other networks such as protein interaction networks, computer networks and food
web. In this paper, our objective is to perform a critical analysis of
different social networks using structural metrics in an effort to highlight
their similarities and differences. We use five different social network
datasets which are contextually and semantically different from each other. We
then analyze these networks using a number of different network statistics and
metrics. Our results show that although these social networks have been
constructed from different contexts, they are structurally similar. We also
review the snowball sampling method and show its vulnerability against
different network metrics.

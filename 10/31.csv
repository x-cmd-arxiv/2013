of on-site interaction on Anderson localization of two interacting bosons in
one dimension. It is shown that classical light and linear elements are
sufficient to experimentally probe the interplay between interaction and
disorder in this setting. For experimental relevance, we evaluate the
participation ratio and the intensity correlation function as measures of
localization for two types of disorder (diagonal and off-diagonal), for two
types of interaction (repulsive and attractive), and for a variety of initial
input states. Employing a commonly used set of initial states, we show that the
effect of interaction on Anderson localization is strongly dependent on the
type of disorder and initial conditions, but is independent of whether the
interaction is repulsive or attractive. We then analyze a certain type of
entangled input state where the type of interaction is relevant and discuss how
it can be naturally implemented in waveguide arrays. We conclude by laying out
the details of the two-dimensional photonic lattice implementation including
the required parameter regime.

Objectives are twofold: split the work evenly, so that every worker gets an
equal share, and minimize edge cut to achieve a good work locality (i.e.
workers can work independently). Partitioning a graph accessible from memory is
a notorious NP-complete problem. Motivated by the regain of interest for the
stream processing paradigm (where nodes and edges arrive as a flow to the
datacenter), we propose in this paper a stream-enabled graph partitioning
system that constantly seeks an optimum between those two objectives. We first
expose the hardness of partitioning using classic and static methods; we then
exhibit the cut versus load balancing tradeoff, from an application point of
view. With this tradeoff in mind, our approach translates the online
partitioning problem into a standard optimization problem. A greedy algorithm
handles the stream of incoming graph updates while optimizations are triggered
on demand to improve upon the greedy decisions. Using simulations, we show that
this approach is very efficient, turning a basic optimization strategy such as
hill climbing into an online partitioning solution that compares favorably to
literature's recent stream partitioning solutions.

sources with z<0.3 for the unified model (UM) for radio-loud AGN, focusing on
objects with a FRII radio morphology. The sample contains 33 high ionization
galaxies (HIGs) and 18 broad line objects (BLOs). According to the UM, HIGs,
the narrow line sources, are the nuclearly obscured counterparts of BLOs. The
fraction of HIGs indicates a covering factor of the circumnuclear matter of 65%
that corresponds, adopting a torus geometry, to an opening angle of 50+/-5
degree. No dependence on redshift and luminosity on the torus opening angle
emerges. We also consider the implications for a 'clumpy' torus. The
distributions of radio luminosity of HIGs and BLOs are not statistically
distinguishable, as expected from the UM. Conversely, BLOs have a radio core
dominance, R, more than ten times larger than HIGs, as expected in case of jet
Doppler boosting. Modeling the R distributions leads to an estimate of the jet
bulk Lorentz factor of Gamma ~3-5. The test of the UM based on the radio source
size is not conclusive due to the limited number of objects. Studying the
emission line ([OIII], [OII]and [OI]) properties of HEGs and BLOs, we find
evidences of a narrow line region (NLR) density stratification and its partial
obscuration from the torus. In conclusion, the radio and NLR properties of HIGs
and BLOs are consistent with the UM predictions. We also explored the radio
properties of 21 3CR FRII low-ionization galaxies (LIGs) at z<0.3. We find that
they cannot be part of the model that unifies HIGs and BLOs, but they are
instead intrinsically different source, still reproduced by a randomly oriented
population.

oscillatory stress response in time. For larger shear rates, the structure
breaks up into a Grandjean texture with a cholesteric helix lying along the
flow gradient direction. Blue Phase I leads to a very different response. Here,
oscillations are only possible for intermediate shear rates -- very slow flow
causes a transition of the initially ordered structure into an amorphous
network with an apparent yield stress. Larger shear rates lead to another
amorphous state with different structure of the defect network. For even larger
flow rates the same break-up into a Grandjean texture as for Blue Phase II is
observed. At the highest imposed flow rates both cubic blue phases adopt a
flow-aligned nematic state. Our results provide the first theoretical

ionization that transitions from primarily ultraviolet dominated to cosmic ray

required for star clusters to form through a two-stage fragmentation scenario.
Recent linear analyses have shown that the fragmentation length and time scales
can undergo a dramatic drop across the column density boundary that separates
the ultraviolet and cosmic ray dominated ionization regimes. As found in
earlier studies, the absence of an ionization drop and regular perturbations
leads to a single-stage fragmentation on parsec scales in transcritical clouds,
so that the nonlinear evolution yields the same fragment sizes as predicted by
linear theory. However, we find that a combination of initial transcritical
mass-to-flux ratio, evolution through a column density regime in which the
ionization drop takes place, and regular small perturbations to the
mass-to-flux ratio are sufficient to cause a second stage of fragmentation
during the nonlinear evolution. Cores of size ~0.1 pc are formed within an
initial fragment of ~ pc size. Regular perturbations to the mass-to-flux ratio
also accelerate the onset of runaway collapse.

superdiffusive fluctuations associated with the position of a tracer particle

remains elusive, has been observed up to now only in systems close to their
glass transition, suggesting that this could be one of its hallmarks. Here, we
show that the presence of superdiffusion is in actual fact much more general,
provided that the system is crowded and geometrically confined. We present and
solve analytically a minimal model consisting of a driven TP in a dense,
crowded medium in which the motion of particles is mediated by the diffusion of
packing defects, called vacancies. For such non glass-forming systems, our
analysis predicts a long-lived superdiffusion which ultimately crosses over to
giant diffusive behavior. We find that this trait is present in confined
geometries, for example long capillaries and stripes, and emerges as a
universal response of crowded environments to an external force. These findings
are confirmed by numerical simulations of systems as varied as lattice-gases,
dense liquids and granular fluids.

consistent estimator of its density (if it exists) in the strong topology
(induced by the total variation distance). On the other hand, various popular
density estimators such as kernel and wavelet density estimators are optimal in
the strong topology in the sense of achieving the minimax rate over all
estimators for a Sobolev ball of densities. Recently, it has been shown in a
series of papers by Gin\'{e} and Nickl that these density estimators on

$\|\cdot\|_{\mathcal{F}_H}$ metrizes the weak topology and the kernel density

independent optimal rate of $n^{-1/2}$ in $\|\cdot\|_{\mathcal{F}_H}$ along
with providing a uniform central limit theorem for the kernel density
estimator.

higher order multipoles in the magnetic field are shielded progressively
better, by a factor related to the order of the multipole. In regard to the
design of internal coil systems for the generation of uniform internal fields,
we show how one can take advantage of the coupling of the coils to the
innermost magnetic shield to further optimize the uniformity of the field.
These results demonstrate quantitatively a phenomenon that was previously
well-known qualitatively: that the resultant magnetic field within a passively

field itself. Furthermore we provide formulae relevant to active magnetic
compensation systems which attempt to stabilize the interior fields by sensing
and cancelling the exterior fields close to the outermost magnetic shielding

conjectured that for {\alpha} >= n, every Nash equilibrium is a tree, and has
been confirmed for every {\alpha} >= 273n. We improve upon this bound and show
that this is true for every {\alpha} >= 65n. To show this, we provide new and
improved results on the local structure of Nash equilibria. Technically, we
show that if there is a cycle in a Nash equilibrium, then {\alpha} < 65n.
Proving this, we only consider relatively simple strategy changes of the
players involved in the cycle. We further show that this simple approach cannot
be used to show the desired upper bound {\alpha} < n (for which a cycle may
exist), but conjecture that a slightly worse bound {\alpha} < 1.3n can be
achieved with this approach. Towards this conjecture, we show that if a Nash
equilibrium has a cycle of length at most 10, then indeed {\alpha} < 1.3n. We
further provide experimental evidence suggesting that when the girth of a Nash
equilibrium is increasing, the upper bound on {\alpha} obtained by the simple
strategy changes is not increasing. To the end, we investigate the approach for

In this letter we reveal a low saturation regime observed in our experiments

regime the liquid is mostly found within the grain surface roughness and in the
capillary bridges formed at the contacts between the grains. The bridges act as
variable-volume reservoirs and the flow is driven by the capillary pressure
arising at the wetting front according to the roughness length scales. We
propose that this migration (spreading) is the result of interplay between the
bridge volume adjustment to this pressure distribution and viscous losses of a
creeping flow within the roughness. The net macroscopic result is a special
case of non-linear diffusion described by a superfast diffusion equation (SFDE)
for saturation with distinctive mathematical character. We obtain solutions to
a moving boundary problem defined by SFDE that robustly convey a time power law
of spreading as seen in our experiments.

formation of nonlinear plasmonic whispering-gallery modes (WGMs) in
microcavities made of metallic nanowires. Since these WGMs are excited by
induced surface nonlinear dipoles, they can be generated even when they are not
coupled to the radiation continuum. Consequently, the quality factor of these
nonlinear modes can be as large as the theoretical limit imposed by the optical
losses in the metal. Remarkably, our theoretical analysis shows that nonlinear
plasmonic WGMs are characterized by fractional azimuthal modal numbers. This
suggests that the plasmonic cavities investigated here can be used to generate
multi-color optical fields with fractional angular momentum. Applications to
plasmonic sensors are also discussed.

Brownian agents with concentration-dependent chemotactic sensitivity. The
agents in our model move stochastically and produce a chemical ligand at their
current position. The ligand concentration obeys a reaction-diffusion equation
and acts as a chemoattractant for the agents, which bias their motion towards
higher concentrations of the dynamically altered chemical field. We explore the
impact of concentration-dependent response to chemoattractant gradients on
large-scale pattern formation, by deriving a coarse-grained macroscopic
description of the individual based model, and compare the conditions for
emergence of inhomogeneous solutions for different variants of the chemotactic
sensitivity. We focus primarily on the so-called ""Receptor Law"" sensitivity,
which models a non-linear decrease of chemotactic sensitivity with increasing
ligand concentration. Our results reveal qualitative differences between the
""Receptor-Law"", the constant chemotactic response and the so-called ""Log-Law"",
with respect to stability of the homogeneous solution, as well as the emergence
of different patterns (labyrinthine structures, clusters and bubbles) via
spinodal-decomposition or nucleation. We discuss two limiting cases, where the
model can be reduced to the dynamics of single species: (I) the agent density
governed by an density-dependent effective diffusion coefficient and (II) the
ligand-field with an effective bistable, time-dependent reaction rate. In the
end, we turn to single clusters of agents, studying domain growth and
determining mean characteristics of the stationary inhomogeneous state.
Analytical results are confirmed and extended by large-scale GPU simulations of
the individual based model.

fibrant, indeed are nerves of categories, which indicates that all of the
expected coherence equations in each dimension are present. To justify our

homotopy coherent adjunction and furthermore that these extensions are
homotopically unique in the sense that the relevant spaces of extensions are

  We extract several simplicial functors from the free homotopy coherent
adjunction and show that quasi-categories are closed under weighted limits with
these weights. These weighted limits are used to define the homotopy coherent
monadic adjunction associated to a homotopy coherent monad. We show that each
vertex in the quasi-category of algebras for a homotopy coherent monad is a
codescent object of a canonical diagram of free algebras. To conclude, we prove
the quasi-categorical monadicity theorem, describing conditions under which the
canonical comparison functor from a homotopy coherent adjunction to the
associated monadic adjunction is an equivalence of quasi-categories. Our proofs
reveal that a mild variant of Beck's argument is ""all in the weights"" - much of

1.4 GHz-selected sources and a detection of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect
associated with the halos that host them. The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT)
has conducted a survey at 148 GHz, 218 GHz and 277 GHz along the celestial
equator. Using samples of radio sources selected at 1.4 GHz from FIRST and
NVSS, we measure the stacked 148, 218 and 277 GHz flux densities for sources
with 1.4 GHz flux densities ranging from 5 to 200 mJy. At these flux densities,
the radio source population is dominated by active galactic nuclei (AGN), with
both steep and flat spectrum populations, which have combined
radio-to-millimeter spectral indices ranging from 0.5 to 0.95, reflecting the
prevalence of steep spectrum sources at high flux densities and the presence of
flat spectrum sources at lower flux densities. The thermal SZ effect associated
with the halos that host the AGN is detected at the 5$\sigma$ level through its
spectral signature. When we compare the SZ effect with weak lensing
measurements of radio galaxies, we find that the relation between the two is
consistent with that measured by Planck for local bright galaxies. We present a
detection of the SZ effect in some of the lowest mass halos (average
$M_{200}\approx10^{13}$M$_{\odot}h_{70}^{-1}$) studied to date. This detection
is particularly important in the context of galaxy evolution models, as it
confirms that galaxies with radio AGN also typically support hot gaseous halos.
With Herschel observations, we show that the SZ detection is not significantly
contaminated by dust. We show that 5 mJy$<S_{1.4}<$200 mJy radio sources
contribute $\ell(\ell+1)C_{\ell}/(2\pi)=0.37\pm0.03\mu$K$^2$ to the angular
power spectrum at $\ell=3000$ at 148 GHz, after accounting for the SZ effect
associated with their host halos.

All of these effects can yield systematic errors that exceed statistical errors

undergoing radiatively-efficient accretion (detected as X-ray and/or infrared

undergoing powerful mechanically dominated accretion (radio AGN). Consistent
with some previous studies, radiatively efficient AGN appear to be
preferentially hosted in modest star-forming galaxies, with little dependence
on AGN or galaxy luminosity. AGN exhibiting radio-emitting jets due to
mechanically-dominated accretion are almost exclusively observed in massive,
passive galaxies. Crucially, we now provide strong evidence that the observed
host-galaxy trends are independent of redshift. In particular, these different
accretion-mode AGN have remained as separate galaxy populations throughout the

along the same path as galaxies that are not hosting AGN with little evidence

rate from their circumstellar disks. Accretion flares can produce strong
energetic irradiation and heating that may affect the disk in the planet
formation region, close to the central star. During an extreme accretion
outburst in the young star EX Lupi, the prototype of EXor variables, remarkable
changes in molecular gas emission from $\sim1$ AU in the disk have recently
been observed (Banzatti et al. 2012). Here, we focus on water vapor and explore
how it is affected by variable accretion luminosity in T Tauri stars. We
monitored a young highly variable solar-mass star, DR Tau, using simultaneously
two high/medium-resolution ESO-VLT spectrographs: VISIR at 12.4 $\mu$m to
observe water lines from the disk, and X-shooter covering from 0.3 to 2.5
$\mu$m to constrain the stellar accretion. Three epochs spanning timescales
from several days to several weeks were obtained. Accretion luminosity was
estimated to change within a factor $\sim2$, and no change in water emission
was detected at a significant level. In comparison to EX Lupi and EXor
outbursts, DR Tau suggests that the less long-lived and weaker variability
phenomena typical of T Tauri stars may leave water at planet-forming radii in
the disk mostly unaffected. We propose that these systems may provide evidence
for two processes that act over different timescales: UV photochemistry in the
disk atmosphere (faster) and heating of the disk deeper layers (slower).

Nature Physics 8, 475 (2012)), models in which quantum states correspond to
probability distributions over the values of some underlying physical variables
must have the following feature: the distributions corresponding to distinct
quantum states do not overlap. This is significant because if the distributions
do not overlap, then the quantum state itself is encoded by the physical
variables. In such a model, it cannot coherently be maintained that the quantum
state merely encodes information about underlying physical variables. The
theorem, however, considers only models in which the physical variables
corresponding to independently prepared systems are independent. This work
considers models that are defined for a single quantum system of dimension $d$,
such that the independence condition does not arise. We prove a result in a
similar spirit to the original no-go theorem, in the form of an upper bound on
the extent to which the probability distributions can overlap, consistently
with reproducing quantum predictions. In particular, models in which the
quantum overlap between pure states is equal to the classical overlap between
the corresponding probability distributions cannot reproduce the quantum
predictions in any dimension $d \geq 3$. The result is noise tolerant, and an
experiment is motivated to distinguish the class of models ruled out from

low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) in the Ritter-Kolb catalogue we show that there
is statistical evidence for a dearth of black hole systems at short orbital
periods (P_orb < 4h). This could either be due to a true divergence in orbital
period distributions of these two types of system, or to black hole LMXBs being
preferentially hidden from view at short orbital periods. We explore the latter
possibility, by investigating whether black hole LMXBs could be concealed by a
switch to radiatively inefficient accretion at low luminosities. The peak
luminosity and the duration of X-ray binary outbursts are related to the disc
radius and, hence, the orbital period. At short periods, where the peak
outburst luminosity drops close to the threshold for radiatively inefficient
accretion, black hole LMXBs have lower outburst luminosities, shorter outburst
durations and lower X-ray duty cycles than comparable neutron star systems.
These factors can combine to severely reduce the detection probability of short
period black hole LMXBs relative to those containing neutron stars. We estimate
the outburst properties and orbital period distribution of black hole LMXBs
using two models of the transition to radiatively inefficient accretion: an
instantaneous drop in accretion efficiency (eta) to zero, at a fraction (f) of
the Eddington luminosity (L_Edd) and a power-law efficiency decrease, eta
\propto \dot{M}^n, for L < f*L_Edd. We show that a population of black hole
LMXBs at short orbital periods can only be hidden by a sharp drop in
efficiency, either instantaneous or for n >= 3. This could be achieved by a
genuine drop in luminosity or through abrupt spectral changes that shift the
accretion power out of a given X-ray band.

SED fitting. We discuss several approaches for identifying genuine bulge+disk

based on inductive counting to prove that NLOGSPACE is closed un- der

theorem to hold. Concretely, we show that Nondeterministic Jumping Graph
Autmata (ND-JAGs) (pebble automata on graphs), on several families of Cayley
graphs, are equal in power to nondeterministic logspace Turing machines that
are given such graphs as a linear encoding. In particular, it follows that
ND-JAGs can solve co-st-connectivity on those graphs. This came as a surprise
since Cook and Rackoff showed that deterministic JAGs cannot solve
st-connectivity on many Cayley graphs due to their high self-similarity (every
neighbourhood looks the same). Thus, our results show that on these graphs,
nondeterminism provably adds computational power. The families of Cayley graphs
we consider include Cayley graphs of abelian groups and of all finite simple
groups irrespective of how they are presented and graphs corresponding to
groups generated by various product constructions, in- cluding iterated ones.
We remark that assessing the precise power of nondeterministic JAGs and in par-
ticular whether they can solve co-st-connectivity on arbitrary graphs is left
as an open problem by Edmonds, Poon and Achlioptas. Our results suggest a
positive answer to this question and in particular considerably limit the

nonlinear functions, such as Hill functions or sigmoid functions, or
alternatively by piecewise-smooth functions, such as step functions. Consistent
modelling requires that piecewise-smooth and smooth dynamical systems have
similar dynamics, but the conditions for such similarity are not well
understood. Here we show that by smoothing out a piecewise-smooth system one
may obtain dynamics that is inconsistent with the accepted wisdom --- so-called
Filippov dynamics --- at a discontinuity, even in the piecewise-smooth limit.
By subjecting the system to white noise, we show that these discrepancies can
be understood in terms of potential wells that allow solutions to dwell at the
discontinuity for long times. Moreover we show that spurious dynamics will
revert to Filippov dynamics, with a small degree of stochasticity, when the
noise magnitude is sufficiently large compared to the order of smoothing. We
apply the results to a model of a dry-friction oscillator, where spurious
dynamics (inconsistent with Filippov's convention or with Coulomb's model of
friction) can account for different coefficients of static and kinetic
friction, but under sufficient noise the system reverts to dynamics consistent
with Filippov's convention (and with Coulomb-like friction).

Those (d,p) reactions may be viewed as three-body reactions and described with
Faddeev techniques.
  Purpose: Faddeev equations in momentum space have a long tradition of
utilizing separable interactions in order to arrive at sets of coupled integral
equations in one variable. While there exist several separable representations
for the nucleon-nucleon interaction, the optical potential between a neutron
(proton) and a nucleus is not readily available in separable form. The purpose
of this paper is to introduce a separable representation for complex
phenomenological optical potentials of Woods-Saxon type.
  Results: Starting from a global optical potential, a separable representation
thereof is introduced based on the Ernst-Shakin-Thaler (EST) scheme. This
scheme is generalized to non-hermitian potentials. Applications to n$+^{48}$Ca,
n$+^{132}$Sn and n$+^{208}$Pb are investigated for energies from 0 to 50 MeV
and the quality of the representation is examined.
  Conclusions: We find a good description of the on-shell t-matrix for all
systems with rank up to 5. The required rank depends inversely on the angular
momentum. The resulting separable interaction exhibits a different off-shell
behavior compared to the original potential, reducing the high momentum
contributions.

the Enge functions to fit the fringe field shapes at all excitation current

evidence often indicates that some bootstrap methods have difficulty in
maintaining the correct coverage probability, while other methods may be
unstable, often resulting in very large confidence regions. One way to improve
the performance of a bootstrap confidence region is to restrict the shape of
the region in such a way that the error term of an expansion is as small an

to construct an ellipsoidal confidence region. This paper studies the effect of
using the smoothed and iterated bootstrap methods to construct an ellipsoidal
confidence region for a parameter vector. The smoothed estimate is based on a
multivariate kernel density estimator. This paper establishes a bandwidth
matrix for the smoothed bootstrap procedure that reduces the asymptotic

channel with channel state information available at transmitter (CSIT),
fast-varying (FV) channel with channel distribution information available at
transmitter (CDIT), and FV channel with CSIT. A general circuit power model is
considered. For all the three channel cases, the tradeoff between the EE and SE
is studied. It is shown that the EE improves strictly as the SE increases from
0 to the optimum SE, and then strictly degrades as the SE increases beyond the
optimum SE. The impact of {\kappa}, {\rho} and other system parameters on the
optimum EE and corresponding SE is investigated to obtain insight.Some of the
important and interesting results for all the channel cases include: (1) when
{\kappa} increases the SE corresponding to the optimum EE should keep unchanged
if {\phi}(R) = R, but reduced if {\phi}(R) is strictly convex of R; (2) when
the rate-independent circuit power {\rho} increases, the SE corresponding to

physics and classical mechanics, is often perceived as a philosophical
challenge to our concepts of reality, locality or space-time since it contrasts
our intuitive expectations with experimental observations on isolated quantum
systems. While we are used to associating the notion of localization with
massive bodies, quantum physics teaches us that every individual object is
associated with a wave function that may eventually delocalize by far more than
the body's own extension. Numerous experiments have verified this concept at
the microscopic scale but intuition wavers when it comes to delocalization
experiments with complex objects. While quantum science is the uncontested
ideal of a physics theory, one may ask if the superposition principle can
persist on all complexity scales. This motivates matter-wave diffraction and
interference studies with large compounds in a three-grating interferometer
configuration which also necessitates the preparation of high-mass nanoparticle
beams at low velocities. Here we demonstrate how synthetic chemistry allows us
to prepare libraries of fluorous porphyrins which can be tailored to exhibit
high mass, good thermal stability and relatively low polarizability, which
allows us to form slow thermal beams of these high-mass compounds, which can be
detected in electron ionization mass spectrometry. We present successful
superposition experiments with selected species from these molecular libraries

the region's boundary. Rather, in agreement with holographic predictions, it is
extensive for regions whose area is a small (but fixed) fraction of the total
area of the sphere. This is true even in the limit of small noncommutativity.
We also find that entanglement entropy grows linearly with N, where N is the
size of the irreducible representation of SU(2) used to define the fuzzy

one-dimensional and the fractionalization phenomena are hard to observe. Here
we studied the spin and orbital excitations of the anisotropic ladder material
CaCu2O3, whose electronic structure is not one-dimensional. Combining
high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering experiments with
theoretical model calculations we show that: (i) spin-orbital fractionalization
occurs in CaCu2O3 along the leg direction x through the xz orbital channel as
in a 1D system; and (ii) no fractionalization is observed for the xy orbital,
which extends in both leg and rung direction, contrary to a 1D system. We
conclude that the directional character of the orbital hopping can select
different degrees of dimensionality. Using additional model calculations, we
show that spin-orbital separation is generally far more robust than the
spin-charge separation. This is not only due to the already mentioned selection
realized by the orbital hopping, but also due to the fact that spinons are
faster than the orbitons.

viewed as the STU models with additional hyperscalars. We find that the
theories with only one or two such vectors can be generalized naturally to
arbitrary dimensions. The same is true for the D=4 or 5 Einstein-Maxwell theory
with such a hyperscalar. The gauge fields become massive, determined by
stationary points of the hyperscalars a la the analogous Abelian Higgs

fractional or irrational numbers. Tweaking the theories by relaxing the mass

In the BigRIPS separator, RI beams are identified by their atomic number Z and
mass-to-charge ratio A/Q which are deduced from the measurements of time of
flight (TOF), magnetic rigidity (Brho) and energy loss (delta-E), and delivered
as tagged RI beams to a variety of experiments including secondary reaction
measurements. High A/Q resolution is an essential requirement for this scheme,
because the charge state Q of RI beams has to be identified at RIBF energies
such as 200-300 MeV/nucleon. By precisely determining the Brho and TOF values,
we have achieved relative A/Q resolution as good as 0.034% (root-mean-square
value). The achieved A/Q resolution is high enough to clearly identify the
charge state Q in the Z versus A/Q particle identification plot, where
fully-stripped and hydrogen-like peaks are very closely located. The precise
Brho determination is achieved by refined particle trajectory reconstruction,
while a slew correction is performed to precisely determine the TOF value.
Furthermore background events are thoroughly removed to improve reliability of
the particle identification. In the present paper we present the details of the
particle identification scheme in the BigRIPS separator. The isotope separation
in the BigRIPS separator is also briefly introduced.

space-time is considered as a alternative approach to study the NC space-time
of the early Universe. In this formalism, the parameter of noncommutative
$\theta^{\mu\nu}$ is promoted to a coordinate of the space-time, and
consequently, we are describing a field theory in a space-time with
extra-dimension. Consequently, there is a canonical momentum associated to this
new coordinate in which the effects of a new physics can emerge in the
propagation of the fields along the extra-dimension. The Fourier space of this
framework is automatically extended by the addition of new momenta components.
The main concept that we would like to emphasize from the outset is that the
formalism demonstrated here will not be constructed introducing a NC parameter
in the system, as usual. It will be generated naturally from an already NC
space. When the components of the new momentum are zero, the DFR approach is
reduced to the usual NC case, in which $\theta^{\mu\nu}$ is a antisymmetric
constant matrix. We study a scalar field action with self-quartic interaction
$\phi^{4}\star$ defined in the DFR NC spacetime, obtaining the Feynman rules in
the Fourier space for the scalar propagator and vertex of the model. With these
rules we are able to build out the radiative corrections to one loop order for
the model propagator. The influence of the NC scale, as well as the propagation
of the field in the extra-dimension, are analyzed in the ultraviolet
divergences scenario. We investigate the actual possibility if this
$\theta^{\mu\nu}$ conjugate momentum has the property of healing the mixing
IR/UV divergences that emerges in this recently new NC spacetime quantum field
theory.

aspects of them are not well understood. In particular, the process known as
collisionless electron heating, whereby electrons are rapidly energized at the
shock front, is one of the main open issues in shock physics. Here we present
the first clear evidence for efficient collisionless electron heating at the
reverse shock of Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR), revealed by Fe-K diagnostics
using high-quality X-ray data obtained by the Suzaku satellite. We detect
K-beta (3p->1s) fluorescence emission from low-ionization Fe ejecta excited by
energetic thermal electrons at the reverse shock front, which peaks at a
smaller radius than Fe K-alpha (2p->1s) emission dominated by a relatively
highly-ionized component. Comparison with our hydrodynamical simulations
implies instantaneous electron heating to a temperature 1000 times higher than
expected from Coulomb collisions alone. The unique environment of the reverse
shock, which is propagating with a high Mach number into rarefied ejecta with a
low magnetic field strength, puts strong constraints on the physical mechanism
responsible for this heating, and favors a cross-shock potential created by
charge deflection at the shock front. Our sensitive observation also reveals
that the reverse shock radius of this SNR is about 10% smaller than the
previous measurement using the Fe K-alpha morphology from the Chandra
observations. Since strong Fe K-beta fluorescence is expected only from
low-ionization plasma where Fe ions still have many 3p electrons, this feature
is key to diagnosing the plasma state and distribution of the immediate
postshock ejecta in a young SNR.

thought to have a helium white dwarf companion. These systems are believed to
form when a low- to intermediate-mass companion to a neutron star fills its
Roche lobe between central hydrogen exhaustion and core helium ignition. We
confirm that our own stellar models reproduce a well-defined period-companion
mass relation irrespective of the details of the mass transfer process. With
magnetic braking this relation extends to periods of less than 1d for a 1Msun
giant donor. With this and the measured binary mass functions we calculate the
orbital inclination of each system for a given pulsar mass. We expect these
inclinations to be randomly oriented in space. If the masses of the pulsars
were typically 1.35Msun then there would appear to be a distinct dearth of
high-inclination systems. However if the pulsar masses are more typically 1.55
to 1.65Msun then the distribution of inclinations is indeed indistinguishable
from random. If it were as much as 1.75Msun then there would appear to be an
excess of high-inclination systems. Thus with the available data we can argue
that the neutron star masses in binary millisecond pulsars recycled by mass
transfer from a red giant typically lie around 1.6Msun and that there is no
preferred inclination at which these systems are observed. Hence there is
reason to believe that pulsar beams are either sufficiently broad or show no
preferred direction relative to the pulsar's spin axis which is aligned with
the binary orbit. This is contrary to some previous claims, based on a subset
of the data available today, that there might be a tendency for the pulsar
beams to be perpendicular to their spin.

Kronecker coefficients together with other ingredients and show that the
multiplicity of each component in a Kronecker square can be obtained from an
evaluation of a certain polynomial, which depends only on the component and is
computed combinatorially. This polynomial has as many variables as the set of
isomorphism classes of connected skew diagrams of size at most the depth of the
component.
  We present two applications. The first is a contribution to Saxl conjecture,
which asserts that the Kronecker square of the staircase partition, contains
every irreducible character of the symmetric group as a component. We prove
that for any partition there is a piecewise polynomial function in one real
variable such that for all k, such that the multiplicity of this partition in
the Kronecker square of the staircase partition of size k is given by the
evaluation of the polynomial function in k. The second application is a proof
of a new stability property for Kronecker coefficients.

for suppressing unwanted couplings. In its simplest form, the mechanism relies
on the low bandwidth of control pulses of long duration. Here we perform a
higher-order quantum-mechanical treatment that allows for higher precision and
shorter times. In particular, we identify three kinds of off-resonant effects:
i) simultaneous unwanted driven couplings (e.g. due to drive crosstalk), ii)
additional (initially undriven) transitions such as those in an infinite ladder
system, and iii) sideband frequencies of the driving waveform such as we find
in corrections to the rotating wave approximation. With a framework that is
applicable to all three cases, in addition to the known adiabatic error
responsible for a shift of the energy levels we typically see in the
spectroscopy of such systems, we derive error terms in a controlled expansion
corresponding to higher order adiabatic effects and diabatic excitations. We
show, by also expanding the driving waveform in a basis of different order
derivatives of a trial function (typically a Gaussian) these different error
terms can be corrected for in a systematic way hence strongly improving quantum
control of systems with dense spectra.

to serve as good approximations to a class of important ICMNs with mobility
models like random waypoint and random direction, so it is widely adopted in
the performance study of ICMNs. This paper studies the throughput capacity and
delay-throughput tradeoff in the considered ICMNs with Poisson meeting process.
For the concerned ICMN, we first derive an exact expression of its throughput
capacity based on the pairwise meeting rate therein and analyze the expected
end-to-end packet delay under a routing algorithm that can achieve the
throughput capacity. We then explore the inherent tradeoff between delay and
throughput and establish a necessary condition for such tradeoff that holds
under any routing algorithm in the ICMN. To illustrate the applicability of the
theoretical results, case studies are further conducted for the random waypoint
and random direction mobility models. Finally, simulation and numerical results
are provided to verify the efficiency of our theoretical capacity/delay results

novel rattling dynamics in both the doped and undoped tungstates while the Rb

an unusual depression between ~ 50 K and ~ 250 K, coinciding with two
crossovers in the K dynamics: the first at ~ 50 K, from oscillatory to
diffusive, and the second at ~ 250 K, from diffusive back to oscillatory. We
found that the low-temperature crossover is a result of the system
transitioning below the activation energy of the diffusive dynamics whereas the
high-temperature crossover is driven by a complex reconstruction of the local
potential around the K atoms due to the cage dynamics. This leads to a
hardening of the K potential with increasing temperature. This unusual
reconstruction of the potential may have important implications for the
interpretation of finite-temperature dynamics based on zero-temperature
potentials in similar materials. The key result is that the novel K rattling,
involving local diffusion, leads to a significant reduction in the thermal

a homogeneous one zone model involving synchrotron, synchrotron self Compton

PKS2155-304, RGB J0710+591 and 3C279, for which simultaneous multi-wavelength

intrinsic VHE fluxes are then compared with the observations by imaging
atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes to determine the optical depth of VHE
$\gamma$-rays. On comparing these optical depth values with those predicted by
four different EBL models, we observe a somewhat pronounced systematic
deviation for PKS2155-304 and 3C279 at higher energies, especially for the EBL
model proposed by Finke et al.(2010). We attribute this deviation to be an
outcome of either the failure of the extrapolation of blazar SED to VHE

performed by assuming spherical symmetry and averaging the observed X-ray
emission in circular annuli. In the case of a very inhomogeneous and asymmetric
gas distribution, this method has been shown to return biased results in
numerical simulations because of the $n^2$ dependence of the X-ray emissivity.
We propose a method to recover the true density profiles in the presence of
inhomogeneities, based on the derivation of the azimuthal median of the surface
brightness in concentric annuli. We demonstrate the performance of this method
with numerical simulations, and apply it to a sample of 31 galaxy clusters in
the redshift range 0.04-0.2 observed with ROSAT/PSPC. The clumping factors
recovered by comparing the mean and the median are mild and show a slight trend
of increasing bias with radius. For $R<R_{500}$, we measure a clumping factor
$\sqrt{C}<1.1$, which indicates that the thermodynamic properties and
hydrostatic masses measured in this radial range are only mildly affected by
this effect. Comparing our results with three sets of hydrodynamical numerical
simulations, we found that non-radiative simulations significantly overestimate
the level of inhomogeneities in the ICM, while the runs including cooling, star
formation, and AGN feedback reproduce the observed trends closely. Our results
indicate that most of the accretion of X-ray emitting gas is taking place in

condensate of indirect dipolar exciton gas in a double quantum well (QW) system
under external static or dynamic electric fields at finite temperatures.
Electrostatic perturbation is considered to be created by an impurity atom or
shot-range defect of QW fluctuation. The screening of this defect potential by
an exciton condensate is studied. We find asymptotic spatial dependence of the
screened potential and analyse its dependence on the temperature and exciton
concentration. It is shown that the asymptotic of the screened potential has a
steep power law dependence in contrast to the well known results of electron
gas. This peculiarity reflects the bosonic nature of the exciton condensate.
The behavior of exciton condensate under external alternative field created by
a surface acoustic wave (SAW) is examined in detail. We focus our attention on
the dependence of SAW absorption coefficient on temperature and exciton
concentration. We found that at zero temperatures Landau damping does not
contribute to the SAW absorption, but the Belyaev mechanism produces unusual
behavior of SAW absorption coefficient on exciton concentration: if the exciton
concentration exceeds some critical value, the SAW absorption vanishes. At
finite temperatures Landau damping comes into action and results in washing out
the sharp absorption behavior. Such unusual SAW absorption properties can be
used for experimental evidence of the exciton condensation. This method is also
applicable to the experimental testing of both dark and bright exciton
condensates, that is impossible to do with the optical luminescence technique.

investigates the global linear convergence of a simple probabilistic
derivative-free optimization algorithm (DFO). The algorithm samples a candidate
solution from a standard multivariate normal distribution scaled by a step-size
and centered in the current solution. This solution is accepted if it has a
better objective function value than the current one. Crucial to the algorithm
is the adaptation of the step-size that is done in order to maintain a certain
probability of success. The algorithm, already proposed in the 60's, is a
generalization of the well-known Rechenberg's $(1+1)$ Evolution Strategy (ES)
with one-fifth success rule which was also proposed by Devroye under the name
compound random search or by Schumer and Steiglitz under the name step-size
adaptive random search. In addition to be derivative-free, the algorithm is
function-value-free: it exploits the objective function only through
comparisons. It belongs to the class of comparison-based step-size adaptive
randomized search (CB-SARS). For the convergence analysis, we follow the
methodology developed in a companion paper for investigating linear convergence
of CB-SARS: by exploiting invariance properties of the algorithm, we turn the
study of global linear convergence on scaling-invariant functions into the
study of the stability of an underlying normalized Markov chain (MC). We hence
prove global linear convergence by studying the stability (irreducibility,
recurrence, positivity, geometric ergodicity) of the normalized MC associated
to the $(1+1)$-ES. More precisely, we prove that starting from any initial
solution and any step-size, linear convergence with probability one and in
expectation occurs. Our proof holds on unimodal functions that are the
composite of strictly increasing functions by positively homogeneous functions
with degree $\alpha$ (assumed also to be continuously differentiable). This
function class includes composite of norm functions but also non-quasi convex
functions. Because of the composition by a strictly increasing function, it
includes non continuous functions. We find that a sufficient condition for
global linear convergence is the step-size increase on linear functions, a
condition typically satisfied for standard parameter choices. While introduced
more than 40 years ago, we provide here the first proof of global linear
convergence for the $(1+1)$-ES with generalized one-fifth success rule and the
first proof of linear convergence for a CB-SARS on such a class of functions
that includes non-quasi convex and non-continuous functions. Our proof also
holds on functions where linear convergence of some CB-SARS was previously
proven, namely convex-quadratic functions (including the well-know sphere
function).

stable fold maps with singular value sets, defined as the set consisting of all
the singular values, of concentric spheres by the author in 2013; for example,
some special generic maps on spheres are regarded as round fold maps whose
singular value sets are connected. Algebraic invariants such as homology and
homotopy groups of manifolds admitting round fold maps and more precisely, the
homeomorphism and diffeomorphism types of manifolds admitting such maps having
appropriate differential topological structures were studied. Moreover,
explicit round fold maps into the Eucidean space of dimension larger than $1$

structures of bundles over the standard sphere of dimension equal to the
Euclidean space whose fibers are closed smooth manifolds and manifolds of
dimension not smaller than twice the dimension of the Euclidean space
represented as the connected sum of manifolds having the structures of bundles
over the standard sphere of dimension equal to the Euclidean space whose fibers

surface energy (SE) formulation using the linear, cubic and sine functions
(denoted as LinSE, CubSE and SinSE), the fourth using a geometric formulation
(Geom), and the fifth using a characteristic interpolation (CI), were compared
with each other through the study of several problems: (1) the static contact
angle of a drop; (2) a Poiseuille flow-driven liquid column; (3) a wettability
gradient (WG)-driven liquid column; (4) drop dewetting. It was found that while
all WBCs can predict the static contact angle fairly accurately, they may
affect the simulation outcomes of dynamic problems differently, depending on
the driving mechanism. For the flow-driven problem, to use different WBCs had
almost no effect on the flow characteristics over a large scale. But for other
capillarity-driven problems, the WBC had some noticeable effects. For the
WG-driven liquid column, Geom gave the most consistent prediction between the
drop velocity and dynamic contact angles, and LinSE delivered the poorest
prediction in this aspect. Except for Geom, the dynamic contact angle differed
from the prescribed (static) one when other WBCs were used. For drop dewetting,
Geom led to the most violent drop motion whereas CubSE caused the weakest
motion; the initial contact line velocity was also found to be dependent on the
WBC. For several problems, CubSE and SinSE gave almost the same results, and
those by Geom and CI were close as well, possibly due to similar consideration
in their design. Besides various comparisons, a new implementation that may be
used for all WBCs was proposed to mimic the wall energy relaxation and control
the degree of slip. This new procedure made it possible to allow the
simulations to match experimental measurements well.

The motion of the mirror can be realized from the dynamics of the brane at the

mirror undergoing Brownian motion. For small displacement of the mirror, we
derive the analytical results of the correlation functions and response
functions. The dynamics of the mirror due to small fluctuations around the
brane vacuum state in the bulk is found supraohmic so that after initial
growth, the velocity fluctuations approach a saturated value at late time with
a power-law behavior. On the contrary, in the Lifshitz black hole background,
the mirror in thermal fluctuations shows that its relaxation dynamics becomes
ohmic, and the saturation of velocity fluctuations is reached exponentially in
time. Finally a comparison is made with the result of a moving mirror driven by
free fields.

variation occurs, with many periodic polarity reversals every 6.2 years. The
magnetic energy also rises and falls with a regular period, with two magnetic
energy cycles required to complete a polarity cycle. These magnetic energy
cycles arise from a Lorentz-force feedback on the differential rotation,
whereas the polarity reversals are present due to the spatial separation of the
equatorial and polar dynamos. Moreover, an equatorial migration of toroidal

communication costs are substantial and algorithms need to be designed suitably
considering those costs. In this paper we give a novel approach to the
distributed training of linear classifiers (involving smooth losses and L2
regularization) that is designed to reduce the total communication costs. At
each iteration, the nodes minimize locally formed approximate objective
functions; then the resulting minimizers are combined to form a descent
direction to move. Our approach gives a lot of freedom in the formation of the
approximate objective function as well as in the choice of methods to solve
them. The method is shown to have $O(log(1/\epsilon))$ time convergence. The
method can be viewed as an iterative parameter mixing method. A special
instantiation yields a parallel stochastic gradient descent method with strong
convergence. When communication times between nodes are large, our method is
much faster than the Terascale method (Agarwal et al., 2011), which is a state
of the art distributed solver based on the statistical query model (Chuet al.,

affinely invariant subspaces of higher degree polynomials. C. de Boor (Constr.
Approx. 3:199-208, 1987) raised a question on the necessity of scale-invariance
of polynomial space for an arbitrary function; and he omitted the
scale-invariance restriction on the space. In the paper, we present a matrix
approach to determine (not necessarily scale-invariant) polynomial space
contained in the span of integer shifts of a compactly supported function.
Also, in the paper, we consider scaling functions that we call the elliptic
scaling functions (Int. J. Wavelets Multiresolut. Inf. Process. To appear);
and, using the matrix approach, we prove that the elliptic scaling functions
satisfy the generalized Strang-Fix conditions and reproduce only affinely
invariant polynomial spaces. Namely we prove that any algebraic polynomial
contained in the span of integer shifts of a compactly supported elliptic
scaling function belongs to the null-space of a homogeneous elliptic
differential operator. However, in the paper, we present nonstationary elliptic
scaling functions such that the scaling functions reproduce not scale-invariant
(only shift-invariant) polynomial spaces.

be similar to previous CO J = 2$-$1 images in Sant\'iago-Garc\'ia et al.

the head. We also explore possible constraints imposed by the non-detection of

The models were originally developed for hydrogen ENA. In the first one, ENA
are produced outside the heliopause from the ionized neutral solar wind in the
direction where the local interstellar magnetic field is perpendicular to the
line-of-sight. The second model proposes production at the contact layer
between the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC) and the Local Bubble (LB). The
models are redesigned to helium using relevant interactions between atoms and
ions. Resulting intensities are compared with possible emission of helium ENA
from the heliosheath. In the first model, the expected intensity is ~ 0.014
(cm^2 s sr keV)^-1, i.e., of the order of the He emission from the heliosheath,
whereas in the second, the LIC/LB contact layer model, the intensity is ~ (2-7)
(cm^2 s sr keV)^-1, i.e., a few hundred times larger. If the IBEX Ribbon needs
a source population of He ENA leaving the heliosphere, it should not be visible
in He ENA fluxes mainly because of the insufficient supply of the parent He ENA
originating from the neutralized solar wind {\alpha}-particles. We conclude
that full-sky measurements of He ENA could give promising prospect for probing
the Local Interstellar Medium at the distance of a few thousand AU and create
possibility of distinction between above mentioned models of Ribbon origin.

contain inhomogeneities and inconsistencies. In particular, an essential
discrepancy exists between the two main sunspot number series, Wolf (WSN) and
group (GSN) sunspot numbers, before 1848. The source of this discrepancy has so
far remained unresolved. However, the recently digitized series of solar
observations in 1825-1867 by Samuel Heinrich Schwabe, who was the primary
observer of the WSN before 1848, makes such an assessment possible. Methods. We
construct sunspot series, similar to WSN and GSN, but using only Schwabe's
data. These series, called WSN-S and GSN-S, respectively, were compared with
the original WSN and GSN series for the period 1835-1867 to look for possible
inhomogeneities. Results. We show that: (1) The GSN series is homogeneous and
consistent with the Schwabe data throughout the entire studied period; (2) The
WSN series decreases by roughly ~20% around 1848 caused by the change of the
primary observer from Schwabe to Wolf and an inappropriate individual
correction factor used for Schwabe in the WSN; (3) This implies a major
inhomogeneity in the WSN, which needs to be corrected by reducing its values by
20% before 1848; (4) The corrected WSN series is in good agreement with the GSN

This solution has the advantage of being a direct observation of the D
[alpha]emissions coming from the interaction between the boundary of the plasma
and neutral gas, but, on the other hand, it restricts the control to the outer
radius of the plasma only. A complete chain of tools has been set up to
implement, test and simulate a new real time magnetic plasma shape controller
based on the rtEFIT code. The complete working path consists of three elements:
a linear static relationship between control parameters and current demands, a
linear state space model needed to represent the plasma dynamic response in
closed loop simulations, and the possibility to run simulations inside the
Plasma Control System (PCS). The linear relationship has been calculated using
the FIESTA code, which is developed using Matlab at CCFE. The linear state
space model was generated using the CREATE-L code developed by the CREATE
Consortium. It has already been successfully used to model JET, FTU and TCV
tokamaks. Using this working path many simulations have been carried out
allowing fine tuning of the control gains before the real experiment. The
simulation testing includes the plasma shape control law as implemented in PCS
itself, so intensive debugging has been possible prior to operation. Successful
control using rtEFIT was established in the second dedicated experiment during
the MAST 2011-12 campaign. This work is a stepping stone towards divertor
control which is ultimately intended for application to the super-X divertor in

  Accepted for publication in MNRAS letters",,"10.1093/mnrasl/slt158",,"astro-ph.SR astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Atoms and molecules, and in particular CO, are important coolants during the
evolution of interstellar star-forming gas clouds. The presence of dust grains,
which allow many chemical reactions to occur on their surfaces, strongly
impacts the chemical composition of a cloud. At low temperatures, dust grains
can lock-up species from the gas phase which freeze out and form ices. In this
sense, dust can deplete important coolants. Our aim is to understand the
effects of freeze-out on the thermal balance and the evolution of a
gravitationally bound molecular cloud. For this purpose, we perform 3D
hydrodynamical simulations with the adaptive mesh code FLASH. We simulate a
gravitationally unstable cloud under two different conditions, with and without
grain surface chemistry. We let the cloud evolve until one free-fall time is
reached and track the thermal evolution and the abundances of species during
this time. We see that at a number density of 10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$ most of the CO
molecules are frozen on dust grains in the run with grain surface chemistry,
thereby depriving the most important coolant. As a consequence, we find that
the temperature of the gas rises up to $\sim$25 K. The temperature drops once
again due to gas-grain collisional cooling when the density reaches a
few$\times$10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$. We conclude that grain surface chemistry not only
affects the chemical abundances in the gas phase, but also leaves a distinct
imprint in the thermal evolution that impacts the fragmentation of a
star-forming cloud. As a final step, we present the equation of state of a
collapsing molecular cloud that has grain surface chemistry included.

an ultrathin, insulating film supported by a metal substrate is developed and
presented. This new method is based on a previous DFT development that uses a
perfect conductor (PC) model to approximate the electrostatic response of the
metal substrate, while the film and the adsorbate are both treated fully within
DFT [I. Scivetti and M. Persson, Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter 25,
355006 (2013)]. The missing interactions between the metal substrate and the
insulating film in the PC approximation are modelled by a simple force field
(FF). The parameters of the PC model and the force field are obtained from DFT
calculations of the film and the substrate, here shown explicitly for a NaCl
bilayer supported by a Cu(100) surface. In order to obtain some of these
parameters and the polarisability of the force field, we have to include an
external, uniformly charged plane in the DFT calculations, which has required
the development of a periodic DFT formalism to include such a charged plane in
the presence of a metal substrate. This extension and implementation should be
of more general interest and applicable to other challenging problems, for
instance, in electrochemistry. As illustrated for the gold atom on the NaCl
bilayer supported by a Cu(100) surface, our new DFT-PC-FF method allows us to
handle different charge states of adsorbates in a controlled and accurate
manner with a considerable reduction of the computational time. In addition, it
is now possible to calculate vertical transition and reorganisation energies
for charging and discharging of adsorbates that cannot be obtained by current
DFT methodologies that include the metal substrate. We find that the computed
vertical transition energy for charging of the gold adatom is in good agreement
with experiments.

Observations of early stage YSOs are needed to probe disk formation. Aims:
VLA1623 is a triple non-coeval protostellar system, with a weak magnetic field
perpendicular to the outflow, whose Class 0 component, VLA1623A, shows a
disk-like structure in continuum with signatures of rotation in line emission.
We aim to determine whether this structure is in part or in whole a

characteristics. Methods: ALMA Cycle 0 Early Science 1.3 mm continuum and
C$^{18}$O (2-1) observations in the extended configuration are presented here
and used to perform an analysis of the disk-like structure using PV diagrams
and thin disk modelling with the addition of foreground absorption. Results:
The PV diagrams of the C$^{18}$O line emission suggest the presence of a
rotationally supported component with a radius of at least 50 AU. Kinematical
modelling of the line emission shows that the disk out to 180 AU is actually
rotationally supported, with the rotation being well described by Keplerian
rotation out to at least 150 AU, and the central source mass to be $\sim$0.2
M$_{sun}$ for an inclination of 55$^{\circ}$. Pure infall and conserved angular
momentum rotation models are excluded. Conclusions: VLA1623A, a very young
Class 0 source, presents a disk with an outer radius $R_{\rm out}$ = 180 AU
with a Keplerian velocity structure out to at least 150 AU. The weak magnetic
fields and recent fragmentation in this region of rho Ophiuchus may have played
a lead role in the formation of the disk.

state sum model used to define the Kuperberg invariant of 3-manifolds. The
partition function is a scalar constructed as a tensor network where the
building blocks are tensors given by the structure constants of an involutary
Hopf algebra $\mathcal{A}$. These models are very general and are hard to solve
in its entire parameter space. One can obtain familiar models, such as ordinary
gauge theories, by letting $\mathcal{A}$ be the group algebra $\mathbb{C}(G)$
of a discrete group $G$ and staying on a certain region of the parameter space.
We consider the transfer matrix of the model and show that Quantum double
Hamiltonians are derived from a particular choice of the parameters. Such a
construction naturally leads to the star and plaquette operators of the quantum
double Hamiltonians, of which the toric code is a special case when
$\mathcal{A}=\mathbb{C}(\mathbb{Z}_2)$. This formulation is convenient to study
ground states of these generalized quantum double models where they can
naturally be interpreted as tensor network states. For a surface $\Sigma$, the
ground state degeneracy is determined by the Kuperberg 3-manifold invariant of
$\Sigma\times S^1$. It is also possible to obtain extra models by simple
enlarging the allowed parameter space but keeping the solubility of the model.
While some of these extra models have appeared before in the literature, our 3D

strategies, with a focus on silent data corruption errors. Contrarily to
fail-stop failures, such latent errors cannot be detected immediately, and a
mechanism to detect them must be provided. We consider two models: (i) errors
are detected after some delays following a probability distribution (typically,
an Exponential distribution); (ii) errors are detected through some
verification mechanism. In both cases, we compute the optimal period in order
to minimize the waste, i.e., the fraction of time where nodes do not perform
useful computations. In practice, only a fixed number of checkpoints can be
kept in memory, and the first model may lead to an irrecoverable failure. In
this case, we compute the minimum period required for an acceptable risk. For
the second model, there is no risk of irrecoverable failure, owing to the
verification mechanism, but the corresponding overhead is included in the
waste. Finally, both models are instantiated using realistic scenarios and
application/architecture parameters.

as well as the space-borne Atmospheric Imaging Assembly and Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager instruments onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory. One large
absorption event situated within the plage region trailing the lead sunspot of
AR 11579 is identified within the H-alpha line wings. This event is found to be
co-spatially linked to a medium-scale (around 4 arcseconds in diameter)
brightening within the transition region and corona. This ejection appears to
have a parabolic evolution, first forming in the H-alpha blue wing before
fading and reappearing in the H-alpha red wing, and comprises of a number of
smaller fibril events. The line-of-sight photospheric magnetic field shows no
evidence of cancellation leading to this event. Our research has identified
clear evidence that at least a subset of transient brightening events in the
transition region are linked to the influx of cooler plasma from the lower
solar atmosphere during large eruptive events, such as surges. These
observations agree with previous numerical researches on the nature of blinkers
and, therefore, suggest that magnetic reconnection is the driver of the
analysed surge events; however, further research is required to confirm this.

applicability in several physical contexts, the problem has been intensively
studied in recent years, and several results concerning existence, multiplicity

$\beta_{ij}\le 0$ for every $i \neq j$, or $\beta_{ij}>0$ for every $i \neq j$

partial results are known in the case of \emph{simultaneous cooperation and

first main results establishes the existence of solutions with at least $m$
positive components for every $m \le d$. Any such solution is a minimizer of
the energy functional $J$ restricted on a \emph{Nehari-type manifold}

as STT-RAM (spin torque transfer RAM) for designing on-chip caches, since they
provide high density and consume low leakage power. A common limitation of all
non-volatile devices is their limited write endurance. Further, since existing
cache management policies are write-variation unaware, excessive writes to a
few blocks may lead to a quick failure of the whole cache. We propose an
architectural technique for wear-leveling of non-volatile last level caches
(LLCs). Our technique uses cache-coloring approach which adds a
software-controlled mapping layer between groups of physical pages and cache
sets. Periodically the mapping is altered to ensure that write-traffic can be
spread uniformly to different sets of the cache to achieve wear-leveling.
Simulations performed with an x86-64 simulator and SPEC2006 benchmarks show
that our technique reduces the worst-case writes to cache blocks and thus
improves the cache lifetime by 4.07X.

counter-gradient heat transport are identified: one is due to the bulk dynamics
and the other is due to the competitions between the corner-flow rolls and the
large-scale circulation (LSC). While the magnitude of the former is found to
increase with increasing Prandtl number, that of the latter maximizes at medium
$Pr$. We further reveal that the corner-LSC competitions lead to the anomalous
$Nu$-$Pr$ relation in 2D RB convection, i.e. $Nu(Pr)$ minimizes, rather than
maximizes as in three-dimensional cylindrical case, at $Pr\approx2\sim3$ for
moderate $Ra$.

>100 GeV) gamma-ray emitter by MAGIC, is one of the few non-blazar AGN detected
in the VHE regime. In order to better understand the origin of the gamma-ray
emission and locate it within the galaxy, we studied contemporaneous
multi-frequency observations of NGC 1275 and modeled the overall spectral
energy distribution (SED). We analyzed unpublished MAGIC observations carried
out between Oct. 2009 and Feb. 2010, and the previously published ones taken
between Aug. 2010 and Feb. 2011. We studied the multi-band variability and
correlations by analyzing data of Fermi-LAT (0.1-100 GeV), as well as Chandra
(X-ray), KVA (optical) and MOJAVE (radio) data taken during the same period.
Using customized Monte Carlo simulations corresponding to early MAGIC stereo
data, we detect NGC 1275 also in the earlier campaign. The flux level and
energy spectra are similar to the results of the second campaign. The monthly
light curve >100 GeV shows a hint of variability at the 3.6 sigma level. In the
Fermi-LAT band, both flux and spectral shape variabilities are reported. The
optical light curve is variable and shows a clear correlation with the
gamma-ray flux >100 MeV. In radio, 3 compact components are resolved in the
innermost part of the jet. One of them shows a similar trend as the LAT and KVA
light curves. The 0.1-650 GeV spectra measured simultaneously with MAGIC and
Fermi-LAT can be well fitted either by a log-parabola or by a power-law with a
sub-exponential cutoff for both campaigns. A single-zone
synchrotron-self-Compton model, with an electron spectrum following a power-law
with an exponential cutoff, can explain the broadband SED and the multi-band
behavior of the source. However, this model suggests an untypical low
bulk-Lorentz factor or a velocity alignment closer to the line of sight than
the pc-scale radio jet.

motion of the associated coronal mass ejection (CME). For the 13 GLE events
that had source latitudes >30 degrees we found evidence for possible non-radial
CME motion due to deflection by large-scale magnetic structures in nearby
coronal holes, streamers, or pseudo streamers. Polar coronal holes are the main
source of deflection in the rise and declining phases of solar cycles. In the
maximum phase, deflection by large-scale streamers or pseudo streamers
overlying high-latitude filaments seems to be important. The B0 angle reduced
the ecliptic distance of some GLE source regions and increased in others with
the net result that the average latitude of GLE events did not change
significantly. The non-radial CME motion is the dominant factor that reduces
the ecliptic distance of GLE source regions, thereby improving the latitudinal
connectivity to Earth. We further infer that the GLE particles must be
accelerated at the nose part of the CME-driven shocks, where the shock is
likely to be quasi-parallel.

7.3 hours, which is similar to the predictions by the ENLIL model. We also find

bound is the better, the lower the compression rate is but there is a
requirement that the code be universal. So as to improve a received upper bound
for Hilberg's exponent, in this paper, we introduce two novel universal codes,
called the plain switch distribution and the preadapted switch distribution.
Generally speaking, switch distributions are certain mixtures of adaptive
Markov chains of varying orders with some additional communication to avoid so
called catch-up phenomenon. The advantage of these distributions is that they
both achieve a low compression rate and are guaranteed to be universal. Using
the switch distributions we obtain that a sample of a text in English is
non-Markovian with Hilberg's exponent being $\le 0.83$, which improves over the
previous bound $\le 0.94$ obtained using the Lempel-Ziv code.

fields, it has been shown that the Foldy-Wouthuysen (FW) transform of the

gradient (e.g., Stern-Gerlach) force, the T-BMT equation is unaltered and thus
the classical Hamiltonian remains the same, but subtleties arise and need to be
clarified. For the relativistic quantum theory, we apply Eriksen's method to
obtain the exact FW transformations for the two special cases, which in
conjunction strongly suggest that, in the weak-field limit, the FW transformed
Dirac-Pauli Hamiltonian (except for the Darwin term) is in agreement with the
classical Hamiltonian in a manner that classical variables correspond to
quantum operators via a specific Weyl ordering. Meanwhile, the Darwin term is
shown to have no classical correspondence.

asteroid was impacted by a smaller asteroid of less than 100 m in diameter. The
scale of the impactor was established by observations of fading ejecta plumes.
Comparison of the light curves obtained before and after the impact allowed us
to assess how much of Scheila's surface was altered. Cratering physics based on
the impactor size suggests that the size of the affected area is larger than
expected, (effective radii of 3.5 -- 10 km depending on the change in the
albedo of the surface). Similar but more localized albedo changes have been
observed on Vesta and the Martian moons, but are not understood. Empirical laws
describing ejecta blankets however indicate that at distances between 3.5 -- 10
km from the crater, Scheila's surface would be covered by a thin layer 2 mm to
2 cm thick. This dusting, possibly mixed with bright impactor material may be
enough to explain to observed brightness increase. Our results show that
sub-critical impacts may play a significant role in processing the surfaces of
asteroids. The large effect of small impacts on asteroidal light curves
complicate shape modeling.

of freedom, i.e. spin, (C) inversions. The conventional gap and gap-stripe
solitons are obtained in lattices with different parameters. It is shown that
solitons of the same type but obeying different symmetries can exist in the

was possible to detect changes for the water level variability along the

of basic elements of the natural world which lead them to mean different things
when they talk about laws of nature, or states, or the role of mathematics in
physics. These disagreements do not much affect the ordinary practice of
science which is about small subsystems of the universe, described or explained
against a background, idealized to be fixed. But these issues become crucial
when we consider including the whole universe within our system, for then there
is no fixed background to reference observables to. I argue here that the key
issue responsible for divergent versions of naturalism and divergent approaches
to cosmology is the conception of time. One version, which I call temporal
naturalism, holds that time, in the sense of the succession of present moments,
is real, and that laws of nature evolve in that time. This is contrasted with
timeless naturalism, which holds that laws are immutable and the present moment
and its passage are illusions. I argue that temporal naturalism is empirically
more adequate than the alternatives, because it offers testable explanations
for puzzles its rivals cannot address, and is likely a better basis for solving
major puzzles that presently face cosmology and physics.
  This essay also addresses the problem of qualia and experience within
naturalism and argues that only temporal naturalism can make a place for qualia

assessment and estimates for the TV white space in the 470-590MHz band for four
zones of India (all except north) are presented in this work. This is the first
effort in India to estimate TV white spaces in a comprehensive manner. The
average available TV white space per unit area in these four zones is
calculated using two methods: (i) the primary (licensed) user and secondary
(unlicensed) user point of view; and, (ii) the regulations of Federal

available TV white space in the UHF TV band is shown to be more than 100MHz! A
TV transmitter frequency-reassignment algorithm is also described. Based on
spatial-reuse ideas, a TV channel allocation scheme is presented which results
in insignicant interference to the TV receivers while using the least number of
TV channels for transmission across the four zones. Based on this reassignment,
it is found that four TV band channels (or 32MHz) are sufficient to provide the
existing UHF TV band coverage in India.

however, the rotational velocities of these stars are difficult to determine.
Based on our own data for 31 Galactic O stars and incorporating similar data
for 86 OB supergiants from the literature, we aim at investigating the
properties of rotational and extra line-broadening as a function of stellar
parameters and at testing model predictions about the evolution of stellar
rotation. Fundamental stellar parameters were determined by means of the code
FASTWIND. Projected rotational and extra broadening velocities originate from a
combined Ft + GOF method. Model calculations published previously were used to
estimate the initial evolutionary masses. The sample O stars with Minit > 50
Msun rotate with less that 26% of their break-up velocity, and they also lack
objects with v sin i < 50 km/s. For the stars with Minit > 35 Msun on the
hotter side of the bi-stability jump, the observed and predicted rotational
rates agree quite well; for those on the cooler side of the jump, the measured
velocities are systematically higher than the predicted ones. In general, the
derived extra broadening velocities decrease toward cooler Teff, whilst for
later evolutionary phases they appear, at the same v sin i, higher for
high-mass stars than for low-mass ones. None of the sample stars shows extra
broadening velocities higher than 110 km/s. For the majority of the more
massive stars, extra broadening either dominates or is in strong competition
with rotation. Conclusions: For OB stars of solar metallicity, extra broadening
is important and has to be accounted for in the analysis. When appearing at or
close to the zero-age main sequence, most of the single and more massive stars
rotate slower than previously thought. Model predictions for the evolution of
rotation in hot massive stars may need to be updated.

that there is a weak, but a broad, peak in dielectric constant around 85 - 115

environment is very important, yet there is a fundamental difficulty in
understanding its mechanism: to measure an elastic modulus one requires two
points of application of force - a measuring and a reference point. The cell in
contact with substrate has only one (adhesion) point to work with, and thus a
new method of measurement needs to be invented. The aim of this theoretical
work is to develop a self-consistent physical model for mechanosensitivity, a
process by which a cell detects the mechanical stiffness of its environment
(e.g. a substrate it is attached to via adhesion points) and generates an
appropriate chemical signaling to remodel itself in response to this
environment. The model uses the molecular mechanosensing complex of latent
TGF-$\beta$ attached to the adhesion point as the biomarker. We show that the
underlying Brownian motion in the substrate is the reference element in the
measuring process. The model produces the closed expression for the rate of
release of active TGF-$\beta$, which depends on the substrate stiffness and the
pulling force coming from the cell in a subtle and non-trivial way. It is
consistent with basic experimental data showing an increase in signal for
stiffer substrates and higher pulling forces. In addition, we find that for
each cell there is a range of stiffness where a homeostatic configuration of
the cell can be achieved, outside of which the cell either relaxes its
cytoskeletal forces and detaches from the very weak substrate, or generates an
increasingly strong pulling force through stress fibers with a positive
feedback loop on very stiff substrates. In this way, the theory offers the
underlying mechanism for the myofibroblast conversion in wound healing and
smooth muscle cell dysfunction in cardiac disease.

Furthermore, if the sensitivity alpha is greater than the relative-velocity

Fewer significant periods are found in the smaller radial velocity data sets,
but they agree with those of the light curves. The color curves generally mimic
the light curves, with the objects reddest when faintest. A comparison in
seasons when there exist contemporaneous light, color, and velocity curves
reveals that the light and color curves are in phase, while the radial velocity
curves are 0.25 out of phase with the light curves. Thus they differ from what
is seen in Cepheids, in which the radial velocity curve is 0.50 P out of phase
with the light curve. Comparison of the observed periods and amplitudes with
those of post-AGB pulsation models shows poor agreement, especially for the
periods, which are much longer than predicted. These observational data,

excellent benchmark for new pulsation models of cool stars in the post-AGB,

classified as a Potentially Hazardous Asteroid, has a highly eccentric orbit.
It was studied by multi-wavelength photometry within the framework of an NEA

color variation across the surface of (297274) 1996 SK within one asteroidal
rotation period of $4.656\pm0.122$ hours and classify it as a S-type asteroid
according to its average colors of $B-V=0.767\pm0.033$, $V-R=0.482\pm0.021$,
$V-I=0.801\pm0.025$ and the corresponding relative reflectance spectrum. It
might be indicative of differential space weathering effect or compositional
inhomogeneity of the surface materials.

are of fundamental importance for a variety of physical, chemical, and
biological phenomena, such as interactions between macromolecules in solution,
surface forces, and diffusion in narrow pores. However, in contrast to bulk
fluids, properties of inhomogeneous fluids are seldom studied at the
pair-distribution level. Motivated by recent experimental advances in
determining anisotropic structure factors of confined fluids, we analyze
theoretically the underlying anisotropic pair distributions of the archetypical
hard-sphere fluid confined between two parallel hard surfaces using
first-principles statistical mechanics of inhomogeneous fluids. For this
purpose, we introduce an experimentally accessible ensemble-averaged local
density correlation function and study its behavior as a function of confining
slit width. Upon increasing the distance between the confining surfaces, we
observe an alternating sequence of strongly anisotropic versus more isotropic
local order. The latter is due to packing frustration of the spherical
particles. This observation highlights the importance of studying inhomogeneous
fluids at the pair-distribution level.

this behavior is actually quite natural when analyzed ""all-at-once"" (as in

Ricci-flat internal space, e.g., a Calabi-Yau manifold. We perturb this
background metrics by a system of gravitating masses, e.g., astrophysical
objects such as our Sun. We suppose that these masses are pressureless in the
external space but they have relativistic pressure in the internal space. We
show that metric perturbations do not depend on coordinates of the internal
space and gravitating masses should be uniformly smeared over the internal
space. This means, first, that KK modes corresponding to the metric
fluctuations are absent and, second, particles should be only in the ground
quantum state with respect to the internal space. In our opinion, these results
look very unnatural. According to statistical physics, any nonzero temperature
should result in fluctuations, i.e. in KK modes. We also get formulae for the
metric correction terms which enable to calculate the gravitational tests: the
deflection of light, the time-delay of the radar echoes and the perihelion
advance.

vibrations associated with trachea and larynx when Italian vowels are emitted.
The mechanical measurements have been made by using two laser Doppler
vibrometers (based on the well-known not-invasive optical measurement
technique) coupled with the acoustic field measured by high-quality certified
microphones. The recorded signals are analyzed by using well-established
methods in time and frequency domains. The signals of the mechanical vibrations
along the trachea and the larynx are compared with those of the acoustic ones.
Focusing the attention of the signals' onsets, we can observe an upward
propagation of the mechanical vibrations for which it is possible to estimate a
delay between the traces. We observe that the mechanical oscillations at the
trachea start before the larynx and acoustic oscillations. Moreover these
tracheal oscillations are self-oscillations in time and are associated with the
pitch production, indicating a further hydrodynamic instability at trachea.
This leads to new insights in the mechanism controlling the pitch in the
speech.

a hardware architecture of the successive cancellation list decoder in the

simplification together with the gains in the metric sorter, lead to $56\%$ to
$137\%$ higher throughput per unit area than other recently proposed

successive cancellation list decoder at different list sizes using different
CRCs and conclude that it is important to adapt the CRC length to the list size

codes. Finally, we synthesize conventional successive cancellation decoders at
large block-lengths with the same block-error probability as our proposed
CRC-aided successive cancellation list decoders to demonstrate that, while our
decoders have slightly lower throughput and larger area, they have a
significantly smaller decoding latency.

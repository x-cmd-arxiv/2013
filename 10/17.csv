thickness ($\delta_{np}$) of the projectile, and check the idea of whether the
neutron-skin thickness effects can fully explain the systematic dependence of
the IYR(m). \item[Methods] A modified statistical abrasion-ablation model is
used to calculate the reactions induced by projectiles of three series.
\item[Results] The IYR(m) shows a distribution of a linear part in the
small-$x$ fragments, and a nonlinear part in the large-$x$ fragments. The
linear part of IYR(m) is fitted. (1) In the calcium isotopic reactions, the
IYR(m) depends on the isospin or the volume of the projectile, but
$\delta_{np}$ greatly influences the nonlinear part of the IYR(m). The IYR(m)
does not depend on the colliding source in reactions of small $b_{\mbox{max}}$
for the nonneutron-rich projectiles, and does not depend on the collision
sources in reactions by the neutron-rich projectiles; (2) In reactions of the
$A = 45$ isobars, though IYR(m) depends on the isospin of projectile, IYR(m)
shows small dependence on isospin if $\delta_{np} > 0$; (3) In the reactions of
projectiles having similar $\delta_{np}$, the IYR(m) in the small mass
fragments show no dependence on the volume and the isospin of the projectile
when the mass of the projectile is relatively large. Specially, the dependence
of IYR(m) on the mass of the isospin of the projectile vanishes when
$\delta_{np}\sim0.02$fm. \item[Conclusions] The linear and nonlinear parts of
the IYR(m) are governed by the core and the surface (skin) of the projectile,
respectively. The neutron-skin effects can well explain the systematic
dependence of the IYR(m).

entropy associated with Shannon and Jaynes. For model two-electron spin
compensated systems, some analytic progress is first reported. The Jaynes
entropy is clearly related to correlation kinetic energy. A way of testing the
usefulness of a known uncertainty principle inequality is proposed for a whole
class of model two-electron atoms with harmonic confinement but variable
electron-electron interaction. Emerging properties are then studied by
reference to bcc Na at ambient pressure and its modeling by `jellium'. Jellium
itself has collective behaviour with changes of the density, especially
noteworthy being the discontinuity of the momentum distribution at the Fermi
surface. This has almost reduced to zero at $r_s = 100$ a.u., the neighbourhood
in which the quantal Wigner electron solid transition is known to occur.
However, various workers have studied crystalline Na under pressure and their
results are compared and contrasted. Work by DFT on K, Rb, and Cs is discussed,
but now with reduced density from the ambient pressure value. The crystalline
results for the cohesive energy of these metals as a function of lattice
parameters and local coordination number are shown to be closely reproduced by
means of ground and excited states for dimer potential energy curves. Then,
pair potentials for liquid Na and Be are reviewed, and compared with the
results of computer simulations from the experimental structure factor for Na.
Finally, magnetic field effects are discussed. First a phenomenological model
of the metal-to-insulator transition is presented with an order parameter which
is the discontinuity in the Fermi momentum distribution. Lastly, experiments on
a two-dimensional electron assembly in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterojunction in a
perpendicular magnetic field are briefly reviewed and then interpreted.

Economies for its empirical power and it is commonly used in explaining the
trade flow between countries; it relies on a function that relates the trade
with the masses of the two countries and the distance (as a proxy of the
trasport costs) between them. However, the notion that using of distance
functions in conventional interaction models effectively captures spatial
dependence in international flows has long been challenged. It has been
recently fully recognized that a spatial interaction effect exists essentially
due to the spatial spillover and the third country effect. This motivates the
introduction of the spatial autoregressive components in the so-called spatial
gravity model of trade. A so-called weight matrix is used in order to define
the set of the spatial neighbors and it is traditionally based on the inverse
of the distance. Two issues follow from this standard procedure: the first
regards the biasness of the distance if it is used as a proxy of the transport
costs in a panel data, the second is related to the collinearity emerging if we
use distance twice. So, several attempt were made in the recent literature
having the scope of remove the distance. We propose a theoretically consistent
procedure based on Anderson, Van Wincoop derivation model, and some ad-hoc
tests, relating to this attempt. The empirical results based on a 22-years
panel of OECD countries are conforting, and they allow us to estimate the model
without the distance, if properly replaced by a set of fixed effects. This
article, in addition, fits in the dispute about how to estimate the
multilateral resistance terms.

their peak luminosity have recently been discovered in faint galaxies at
redshifts of 0.1-4. Some evolve slowly, resembling models of 'pair-instability'
supernovae. Such models involve stars with original masses 140-260 times that
of the Sun that now have carbon-oxygen cores of 65-30 solar masses. In these
stars, the photons that prevent gravitational collapse are converted to
electron-positron pairs, causing rapid contraction and thermonuclear
explosions. Many solar masses of 56Ni are synthesized; this isotope decays to
56Fe via 56Co, powering bright light curves. Such massive progenitors are
expected to have formed from metal-poor gas in the early Universe. Recently,
supernova 2007bi in a galaxy at redshift 0.127 (about 12 billion years after
the Big Bang) with a metallicity one-third that of the Sun was observed to look
like a fading pair-instability supernova. Here we report observations of two
slow-to-fade super-luminous supernovae that show relatively fast rise times and
blue colours, which are incompatible with pair-instability models. Their
late-time light-curve and spectral similarities to supernova 2007bi call the
nature of that event into question. Our early spectra closely resemble typical
fast-declining super-luminous supernovae, which are not powered by
radioactivity. Modelling our observations with 10-16 solar masses of
magnetar-energized ejecta demonstrates the possibility of a common explosion
mechanism. The lack of unambiguous nearby pair-instability events suggests that

on Finsler and Kawaguchi manifolds. While Finsler geometry is a natural
extension of Riemannian geometry, Kawaguchi geometry is the extension of
Finsler geometry to higher order derivatives and to k-dimensional parameter
space. The latter extension is also called areal geometry in some references.
On Finsler (Kawaguchi) manifold, we can define a reparameterisation invariant 1
(k)-dimensional area by the Hilbert (Kawaguchi) form, which we take as an
action. The equation of motion obtained from such action also has the property
of reparameterisation invariance. In this framework, the solution manifold of
the Euler-Lagrange equation is realised as a submanifold of Finsler/Kawaguchi
manifold, and no fibered structure over the parameter space is needed. We also
show that for the case of first order k-dimensional parameter space and second
order 1-dimensional parameter space, a global Lagrangian could be constructed.
For second order k-dimensional parameter space, Lagrangian is not global but it
still has the reparameterisation invariant property. Such theory is expected to
provide the ideal stage for formulating fundamental theories of physics,
especially for cases such as when one needs to consider the mixing of spacetime
and field variables. It is shown that locally, any conventional Lagrangian
could be reformulated by the parameter independent Lagrangian. Furthermore, the
parameter independent property will gives us the freedom of choosing a
parameter, which in some cases turns out to be useful in finding solutions and
symmetries.

  Networks",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The cumulative distribution network (CDN) is a recently developed class of
probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) permitting a copula factorization, in
which the CDF, rather than the density, is factored. Despite there being much
recent interest within the machine learning community about copula
representations, there has been scarce research into the CDN, its amalgamation
with copula theory, and no evaluation of its performance. Algorithms for
inference, sampling, and learning in these models are underdeveloped compared
those of other PGMs, hindering widerspread use.
  One advantage of the CDN is that it allows the factors to be parameterized as
copulae, combining the benefits of graphical models with those of copula
theory. In brief, the use of a copula parameterization enables greater
modelling flexibility by separating representation of the marginals from the
dependence structure, permitting more efficient and robust learning. Another
advantage is that the CDN permits the representation of implicit latent
variables, whose parameterization and connectivity are not required to be
specified. Unfortunately, that the model can encode only latent relationships
between variables severely limits its utility.
  In this thesis, we present inference, learning, and sampling for CDNs, and
further the state-of-the-art. First, we explain the basics of copula theory and
the representation of copula CDNs. Then, we discuss inference in the models,
and develop the first sampling algorithm. We explain standard learning methods,
propose an algorithm for learning from data missing completely at random
(MCAR), and develop a novel algorithm for learning models of arbitrary
treewidth and size. Properties of the models and algorithms are investigated
through Monte Carlo simulations. We conclude with further discussion of the
advantages and limitations of CDNs, and suggest future work.

Riemannian manifold describing the geometry of a shape into Euclidean space.
Several methods have been proposed to embed isometric shapes in flat domains
while preserving distances measured on the manifold. Recently, attention has
been given to embedding shapes into the eigenspace of the Lapalce-Beltrami
operator. The Laplace-Beltrami eigenspace preserves the diffusion distance, and
is invariant under isometric transformations. However, Laplace-Beltrami
eigenfunctions computed independently for different shapes are often
incompatible with each other. Applications involving multiple shapes, such as
pointwise correspondence, would greatly benefit if their respective
eigenfunctions were somehow matched. Here, we introduce a statistical approach
for matching eigenfunctions. We consider the values of the eigenfunctions over
the manifold as sampling of random variables, and try to match their
multivariate distributions. Comparing distributions is done indirectly, using
high order statistics. We show that the permutation and sign ambiguities of low
order eigenfunctions, can be inferred by minimizing the difference of their
third order moments. The sign ambiguities of antisymmetric eigenfunctions can
be resolved by exploiting isometric invariant relations between the gradients
of the eigenfunctions and the surface normal. We present experiments
demonstrating the success of the proposed method applied to feature point
correspondence.

balance---how often a team wins an event---follows a common Bernoulli process,
with a parameter that effectively varies with the size of the lead. Combining
these processes within a generative model of gameplay, we find they both
reproduce the observed dynamics in all four sports and accurately predict game
outcomes. These results demonstrate common dynamical patterns underlying
within-game scoring dynamics across professional team sports, and suggest
specific mechanisms for driving them. We close with a brief discussion of the

that takes cross-asset impact into account. Our main goal is to single out
properties that need to be imposed on the decay kernel so that the model admits
well-behaved optimal trade execution strategies. We first show that the
existence of such strategies is guaranteed by assuming that the decay kernel
corresponds to a matrix-valued positive definite function. An example
illustrates, however, that positive definiteness alone does not guarantee that
optimal strategies are well-behaved. Building on previous results from the
one-dimensional case, we investigate a class of nonincreasing, nonnegative and
convex decay kernels with values in the symmetric $K\times K$ matrices. We show
that these decay kernels are always positive definite and characterize when
they are even strictly positive definite, a result that may be of independent
interest. Optimal strategies for kernels from this class are well-behaved when
one requires that the decay kernel is also commuting. We show how such decay
kernels can be constructed by means of matrix functions and provide a number of
examples. In particular we completely solve the case of matrix exponential
decay.

discrete-time threshold contact process with parameter q=2p(1-p) (in which a

t+1 with probability q, and 'vacant' otherwise) on the above random graph to

contact process maintains a positive ({\it quasi-stationary}) density of
occupied sites for time which is exponential in n, whereas if 2p(1-p)r<1, then
the persistence time of the threshold contact process is at most logarithmic in

Generally one uses electro-stimulating devices where electrodes are arranged
into arrays to stimulate the skin or the tongue mucosa to send signals of
visual type to the subjects. When an electro-stimulation signal is applied
continuously (e.g. when static visual scenes are displayed for a long period of
time), the receptors of the affected region can get saturated and the patient
may lose the displayed information. We propose here some mechanisms that
ameliorate the quality of perception of the electro-stimulation information.
The electrical signal is encoded as 2D scenes projected onto the tongue via a
Tongue Display Unit, i.e. an electro-tactile stimulator formed by a 12x12
matrix of electrodes. We propose to apply stochastic saccades on this signal.
Our assumption is that this eye-inspired mechanism should make the visual
substitution more efficient (by improving the perception) because of the
reduction of the tactile receptors saturation. The influence of saccades was
evaluated by a series of experiments. Results revealed a benefit on the
persistence of perception due to saccades. This work helps to prevent the
saturation of receptors on the tongue. Therefore increasing the quality of
vision by the way of the electro-stimulation. It allows new enhancement
features to retinal prosthesis devices which suffer from the same phenomenon.

provide a description of the scalar charge of each binary's component along the

the spiral arms and inter-arms of the spiral galaxy NGC 6946, with observations
of the CO(1-0), CO(2-1), CO(3-2), CO(4-3), CO(6-5), 13CO(1-0) and 13CO(2-1)
transitions. For each region, we use the large velocity gradient assumption to
derive beam-averaged molecular gas physical properties, namely the gas kinetic
temperature (T_K), H2 number volume density n(H2) and CO number column density
N(CO). Two complementary approaches are used to compare the observations with
the model predictions: chi-square minimisation and likelihood. The physical
conditions derived vary greatly from one region to the next: T_K=10-250 K,
n(H2)=10^2.3-10^7.0 cm^-3 and N(CO)=10^15.0-10^19.3 cm^-2. The spectral line
energy distribution (SLED) of some of these extranuclear regions indicates a
star-formation activity that is more intense than that at the centre of our own
Milky Way. The molecular gas in regions with a large SLED turnover transition
(J_max>4) is hot but tenuous with a high CO column density, while that in
regions with a low SLED turnover transition (J_max<=4) is cold but dense with a
low CO column density. We finally discuss and find some correlations between
the physical properties of the molecular gas in each region and the presence of
young stellar population indicators (supernova remnants, HII regions, HI holes,
etc.)

function (IGIMF) theory. A variant of the theory, in which the IGIMF depends
upon the metallicity of the parent galaxy, is also considered. The IGIMF theory
predicts low [alpha/Fe] plateaus in dwarf galaxies, characterised by small
SFRs. The [alpha/Fe] plateau is up to 0.7dex lower than the corresponding
plateau of the Milky Way. For a universal IMF one should expect instead that
the [alpha/Fe] plateau is the same for all the galaxies, irrespective of their
masses or SFRs. Assuming a strong dependence of the IMF on the metallicity of
the parent galaxy, dwarf galaxies can show values of the [alpha/Fe] plateau
similar to those of the Milky Way, and almost independent on the SFR. The
[Mg/Fe] ratios of the most metal-poor stars in dwarf galaxies satellites of the
Milky Way can be reproduced either if we consider metallicity-dependent IMFs or
if the early SFRs of these galaxies were larger than we presently think.
Present and future observations of dwarf galaxies can help disentangle between

observations of SNR 0104-72.3 to produce imaging and spectra with an effective

relative to other nearby young SNRs, suggesting a core-collapse SN origin.
Furthermore, we compare ejecta abundances derived from spectral fits to
nucleosynthetic yields of Type Ia and core-collapse (CC) SNe, and we find that
the iron, neon, and silicon abundances are consistent with either a spherical
CC SN of a 18-20 solar mass progenitor or an aspherical CC SN of a 25 solar
mass progenitor. We show that the star-formation history at the site of SNR
0104-72.3 is also consistent with a CC origin. Given the bipolar morphology of
the SNR, we favor the aspherical CC SN scenario. This result may suggest
jet-driven SNe occur frequently in the low-metallicity environment of the SMC,
consistent with the observational and theoretical work on broad-line Type Ic

the results for other massive GCs (e.g., $\omega$ Cen, M22, and NGC 1851),
suggests that the discrete distribution of RGB stars in the $hk$ index might be
a universal characteristic of this growing group of peculiar GCs. The planned
narrow-band calcium photometry for the Local Group dwarf galaxies would help to
establish an empirical connection between these GCs and the primordial building
blocks in the hierarchical merging paradigm of galaxy formation.

spectroscopy is used to trace the kinematics of the ionised and warm molecular
hydrogen which are consistent with a ~ 5 kpc rotating disc. Broad,

We estimate the mass of the cold gas within the disc to be M$_{gas}$ = 2.3

line profiles found in the cold atomic and molecular gas are related to the
rotating disc or ring of gas. Finally, an HST image of the galaxy shows that
this gas disc contains a substantial mass of dust. The large gas mass, SFR and
kinematics are consistent with the levels of gas cooling from the ICM. We
conclude that the cold gas originates from the continual quiescent accumulation
of cooled ICM gas. The rotation is in a plane perpendicular to the projected
orientation of the radio jets and ICM cavities hinting at a possible connection
between the kpc-scale cooling gas and the accretion of material onto the black
hole. We discuss the implications of these observations for models of cold

the problematic relation $b_M\sim16\pi^2 m_D^2$, somewhat analogous to the

is identified with a confined meson, the U(1) with a baryon-number like
symmetry, and the messengers with the confined baryons. We find a SUSY breaking

produce a massive NS remnant that is long-lived and, potentially, indefinitely
stable to gravitational collapse. Such a remnant has been proposed as an
explanation for the late X-ray emission observed following some short duration
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and as possible electromagnetic counterparts to the
gravitational wave chirp. A stable NS merger remnant necessarily possesses a
large rotational energy > 1e52 erg, the majority of which is ultimately
deposited into the surrounding circumburst medium (CBM) at mildly relativistic
velocities. We present Very Large Array radio observations of 7 short GRBs,
some of which possessed temporally extended X-ray emission, on timescales of
~1-3 years following the initial burst. No radio sources were detected, with
typical upper limits ~0.3 mJy at 1.4 GHz. A basic model for the synchrotron
emission from the blast wave is used to constrain the presence of a long-lived
NS merger remnant in each system. Depending on the GRB, our non-detections
translate into upper limits on the CBM density n < 3e-2 - 3e-3 particles/cm^3
required for consistency with the remnant hypothesis. Our upper limits rule out
a long-lived remnant in GRB 050724 and 060505, but cannot rule out such a
remnant in other systems due to their lower inferred CBM densities based on
afterglow modeling or the lack of such constraints. Additional VLA observations
in the near future could place tighter limits on the presence of merger
remnants in these system. The population of long-lived NS merger remnants will

after a major merger of gas-rich galaxies, a massive gaseous disk with a SMBH
binary will be formed in the nuclear region. We focus on the gravitational
torques that the binary exerts onto the disk and how these torques can drive
the formation of a gap in the disk. This exchange of angular momentum between
the binary and the disk is mainly driven by the gravitational interaction
between the binary and a strong non-axisymmetric density perturbation that is
produced in the disk, as response to the presence of the binary. Using SPH
numerical simulations we tested two gap-opening criterion, one that assumes
that the geometry of the density perturbation is an ellipsoid/thick-spirals and
another that assumes a geometry of flat-spirals for the density perturbation.
We find that the flat-spirals gap opening criterion successfully predicts which
simulations will have a gap on the disk and which simulations will not have a
gap on the disk. We also study the limiting cases predicted by the gap-opening
criteria. Since the viscosity in our simulations is considerably smaller than
the expected value in the nuclear regions of gas-rich merging galaxies, we

Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey, radial velocities of over 5000 red giant
branch stars in the same magnitude range from the Spectroscopic and Photometric
Landscape of Andromeda's Stellar Halo (SPLASH) survey, and integrated I-band SB
profiles from various sources. We use an affine-invariant Markov chain Monte
Carlo algorithm to fit an appropriate toy model to these three data sets. The
bulge, disk, and halo SB profiles are modeled as a Sersic, exponential, and
cored power-law, respectively, and the LFs are modeled as broken power-laws. We
find that the number of stars with a disk-like LF is ~5% larger than the number
in the dynamically cold component, suggesting that some stars born in the disk
have been dynamically heated to the point that they are kinematically
indistinguishable from halo members. This is the first kinematical evidence for
a ""kicked-up disk"" population in the stellar halo of M31. The fraction of
kicked-up disk stars is consistent with that found in simulations. See Dorman

dramatic flares are not limited to warmer, more massive stars. Scaled to
include a rough estimate of the emission line contribution to the $V$ band, we
estimate a blackbody filling factor of $\sim$$10-30\%$ during the flare peak

correspond to flare areas that are an order of magnitude larger than those

of oxygen-rich circumstellar material, which is considered to exist in disks.
Silicate carbon stars represent interesting cases that allow us to study the
possible effects of binarity on stellar evolution and the mass loss accompanied
by the formation of disks. We present a small survey of the 22 GHz H2O masers
toward 10 silicate carbon stars with much better sensitivity than the previous
observations. We observed our sample with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array
(VLA) using the most expanded configuration (A-configuration) with a maximum
baseline of 36 km. For some of our program stars with noisy IRAS Low Resolution
Spectra (LRS), we present new mid-IR spectra obtained with the Very Large
Telescope Interferometer and the Spitzer Space Telescope. We detected the H2O
masers toward 5 out of 10 silicate carbon stars (EU And, V778 Cyg,
IRAS06017+1011, V1415 Cyg, and NC83=V1945 Cyg), with NC83 being new detection.
No H2O masers were detected toward BM Gem, IRAS07221-0431, IRAS08002-3803,
IRAS18006-3213, and HD189605. The velocity separation between the most blue-
and red-shifted maser features is 10--14 km/s. If we assume that the masers
originate in circum-companion disks, the measured velocity separations
translate into a lower limit of the rotational velocity of 5--7 km/s, and the
upper limit of the radius of the maser emitting region is estimated to be
10--68 AU for a companion mass of 0.5--1.7 Msun. The new mid-IR spectra of
NC83, IRAS06017+1011, and HD189605 confirm the 10 micron silicate emission. The
latter two stars show a bump at ~11.5 micron, which is presumably due to SiC
originating in the ongoing mass loss from the carbon-rich primary star, not due
to crystalline silicate. We also report on the detection of the UV flux at 2271

This inverse-scattering approach allows us to extract the the position and
orientation of the particles as a function of time, along with static
parameters including the size, shape, and refractive index. The best-fit sizes
and refractive indices of both particles agree well with expected values. The
technique is able to track the center of mass of the rod to a precision of 35
nm and its orientation to a precision of 1.5$^\circ$, comparable to or better
than the precision of other 3D diffusion measurements on non-spherical
particles. Furthermore, the measured translational and rotational diffusion
coefficients for the silica rods agree with hydrodynamic predictions for a
spherocylinder to within 0.3%. We also show that although the Janus particles
have only weak optical asymmetry, the technique can track their 2D translation
and azimuthal rotation over a depth of field of several micrometers, yielding
independent measurements of the effective hydrodynamic radius that agree to
within 0.2%. The internal and external consistency of these measurements
validate the technique. Because the discrete dipole approximation can model
scattering from arbitrarily shaped particles, our technique could be used in a
range of applications, including particle tracking, microrheology, and
fundamental studies of colloidal self-assembly or microbial motion.

collections of A. thaliana accessions, covering the native range of the

sampling sites. To address the confounding between geographic location, climate
and population structure, a new genome-wide association analysis method was
developed that facilitates detection of potentially adaptive loci where the
alternative alleles display different tolerable climate ranges. Sixteen novel
such loci, many of which contained candidate genes with amino acid changes,
were found including a strong association between Chromomethylase 2 (CMT2) and
variability in seasonal temperatures. The reference allele dominated in areas
with less seasonal variability in temperature, and the alternative allele,
which disrupts genome-wide CHH-methylation, existed in both stable and variable
regions. Our results link natural variation in CMT2, and differential
genome-wide CHH methylation, to the distribution of A. thaliana accessions

suggest a role for genetic regulation of epigenetic modifications in natural

Mn, Fe, Ni, Zn, Y, Ba, and Nd abundances. For colder, blue HB stars, we derive
abundances for Na, primarily from GIRAFFE spectra. We were also able to measure
direct NLTE He abundances for a subset of these blue HB stars with temperature

different content in Na depending on their position in the color-magnitude
diagram, with blue HB stars having higher Na than red HB stars; (ii) the red HB
is not consistent with an uniform chemical abundance, with slightly warmer
stars exhibiting a statistically significant higher Na content; and (iii) our
subsample of blue HB stars with He abundances shows evidence of enhancement

objects due to surface tension. We consider an array of spring-block elements
separated by thin liquid films, whose dynamics are modelled using lubrication
theory. With this simplified model of elastocapillary coalescence, we present
the results of numerical simulations for a large number of elements,
$N=O(10^4)$. A linear stability analysis shows that pairwise coalescence is
always the most unstable mode of deformation. However, the numerical
simulations show that the cluster sizes actually produced by coalescence from a
small white-noise perturbation have a distribution that depends on the relative
strength of surface tension and elasticity, as measured by an elastocapillary
number $K$. Both the maximum cluster size and the mean cluster size scale like
$K^{-1/2}$ for small $K$. An analytical solution for the response of the system
to a localized perturbation shows that such perturbations generate propagating
disturbance fronts, which leave behind `frozen-in' clusters of a predictable
size that also depends on $K$. A good quantitative comparison between the
cluster-size statistics from noisy perturbations and this `frozen-in' cluster
size suggests that propagating fronts may play a crucial role in the dynamics
of coalescence.

inflation and giving the curvature perturbations, coupled with another
non-equivalent clock that at late times defines the same frame and do not
contribute to the density perturbations. This can happen in the framework of
dissipative EFT of inflation where the additional degrees of freedom include a
fluid developing sound waves propagating with sound speed $c_{sr}$. The fluid
defines a preferred frame comoving with it. The paradigmatic example of this is
the warm inflation scenario. We studied the dynamics of this systems during
inflation and the three-point function. We saw that in the strong dissipation
regime the nonlinear parameter induced by the new terms is $|f_{\rm NL}| \sim
1/c_{sr}^2$, not enhanced by the dissipation parameter which enters the
two-point function. We checked that the squeezed limit of the three-point
function still satisfies the consistency condition with corrections of order
$\mathcal{O}(k_L^2/k_S^2)$. We computed the Planck constraints for the case of
warm inflation obtaining a bound of $\gamma\lesssim 10^5 H$ for the clock
coupled to radiation. For decreasing sound speed the bound decreases. We also
checked that the shape of the three-point function corresponding to the model
studied here is a mixture between equilateral and orthogonal with a small local
component, which is more consistent with Planck's results.

Type-Ia SNe as standard candles. The standardization depends on an empirical
correlation between the stretch/color and peak luminosity of the light curves.
The use of Type Ia SN as standard candles rests on the assumption that their
properties (and this correlation) do not vary with red-shift. We consider the
possibility that the majority of Type-Ia SNe are in fact caused by a Quark-Nova
detonation in a tight neutron-star-CO-white-dwarf binary system; a Quark-Nova
Ia. The spin-down energy injected by the Quark Nova remnant (the quark star)
contributes to the post-peak light curve and neatly explains the observed
correlation between peak luminosity and light curve shape. We demonstrate that
the parameters describing Quark-Novae Ia are NOT constant in red-shift.
Simulated Quark-Nova Ia light curves provide a test of the stretch/color
correlation by comparing the true distance modulus with that determined using
SN light curve fitters. We determine a correction between the true and fitted
distance moduli which when applied to Type-Ia SNe in the Hubble diagram
recovers the Omega_M = 1 cosmology. We conclude that Type-Ia SNe observations
do not necessitate the need for an accelerating expansion of the Universe (if
the observed SNe-Ia are dominated by QNe-Ia) and by association the need for
Dark Energy.

escaped hadronization and survived up to now in the form of quark-gluon nuggets
(QNs), and also taking into account radiation, we investigate scalar
perturbations of the FRW metrics due to inhomogeneities of dustlike matter as
well as fluctuations of QNs and radiation. In particular, we demonstrate that
the nonrelativistic gravitational potential is defined by the distribution of
inhomogeneities/fluctuations of both dustlike matter and QNs. Consequently, QNs
can be distributed around the baryonic inhomogeneities (e.g., galaxies) in such
a way that it can solve the problem of the flatness of the rotation curves. We
also show that the fluctuations of radiation are caused by both the
inhomogeneities in the form of galaxies and the fluctuations of quark-gluon
nuggets. Therefore, if QNs exist, the CMB anisotropy should contain also the
contributions from QNs. Additionally, the spatial distribution of the radiation
fluctuations is defined by the gravitational potential. All these results look
physically reasonable.

theoretical isochrone colors were tested and calibrated against observations of
five well studied galactic clusters: M92, NGC 6752, NGC 104, NGC 5927, and NGC
6791, all of which have spectroscopically determined metallicities spanning
-2.30 < [Fe/H] < +0.4. We found empirical corrections to the Dartmouth
isochrone grid for each of the following color magnitude diagrams (CMD)
(F555W--F814W, F814W), (F336W-F555W, F814W), (F390M-F555W, F814W) and
(F390W-F555W, F814W). Using the empirical corrections we tested the accuracy
and spread of the photometric metallicities assigned from CMDs and color-color
diagrams (which are necessary to break the age-metallicity degeneracy). Testing
three color-color diagrams [(F336W-F555W),(F390M-F555W),(F390W-F555W), vs
(F555W-F814W)], we found the colors (F390M-F555W) and (F390W-F555W), to be the
best suited to measure photometric metallicities. The color (F390W-F555W)
requires much less integration time, but generally produces wider metallicity
distributions, and, at very-low metallicity, the MDF from (F390W-F555W) is ~60%
wider than that from (F390M-F555W). Using the calibrated isochrones we
recovered the overall cluster metallicity to within ~0.1 dex in [Fe/H] when
using CMDs (i.e. when the distance, reddening and ages are approximately
known). The measured metallicity distribution function (MDF) from color-color
diagrams show this method measures metallicities of stellar clusters of unknown
age and metallicity with an accuracy of ~0.2 - 0.5 dex using F336W--F555W,
~0.15 - 0.25 dex using F390M-F555W, and ~0.2 - 0.4 dex with F390W-F555W, with
the larger uncertainty pertaining to the lowest metallicity range.

PYTHIA systematically predicts higher jet rates and harder pt spectra than seen

zero and finite temperatures can be described by a master equation of the
Lindblad form. We derive this equation from a system coupling microscopic to a
heat bath. It is suggested to be valid generally for studying dynamical quantum
criticality and is thus designated as Model Q upon generalizing Hohenberg and
Halperin's classification of classical critical dynamics. We find that the
dissipation rate in the equation must be included in the scaling forms as an
indispensable additional scaling variable in order to correctly describe the
nonequilibrium quantum critical behavior. Yet, the equilibrium fixed point
determines the nonequilibrium critical behavior in the weak coupling limit.
Through numerically solving the Lindblad equation for the quantum Ising chain,
we attest these propositions by finite-time scaling forms with the dissipation
rate. Nonequilibrium dynamic critical behavior of spontaneous emissions in
dissipative open systems at zero temperature near their quantum critical points
is found and is also described well by the scaling forms. Model Q thus provides
a general approach to study quantum critical behavior of a system itself
through its weak coupling to the environment.

problem in intrusion detection and in tracing anonymous connections. A stepping
stone or an anonymity network may try to prevent flow correlation by adding
chaff traffic, splitting the flow in several subflows or adding random delays.
A well-known attack for these types of systems is active watermarking. However,
active watermarking systems can be detected and an attacker can modify the flow
in such a way that the watermark is removed and can no longer be decoded. This
leads to the two basic features of our scheme: a highlyoptimized algorithm that
achieves very good performance and a passive analysis that is undetectable. We
propose a new passive analysis technique where detection is based on
Neyman-Pearson lemma. We correlate the inter-packet delays (IPDs) from both
flows. Then, we derive a modification to deal with stronger adversary models
that add chaff traffic, split the flows or add random delays. We empirically
validate the detectors with a simulator. Afterwards, we create a watermarkbased
version of our scheme to study the trade-off between performance and
detectability. Then, we compare the results with other state-of-the-art traffic
watermarking schemes in several scenarios concluding that our scheme
outperforms the rest. Finally, we present results using an implementation of
our method on live networks, showing that the conclusions can be extended to
real-world scenarios. Our scheme needs only tens of packets under normal
network interference and a few hundreds of packets when a number of
countermeasures are taken.

in stars require a multitude of nuclear physics input. Both systematic model
dependent and statistically correlated uncertainties need to be considered. An
application where realistic uncertainty assessments are especially important is
the intermediate neutron capture process or i process: a neutron capture regime
with neutron densities intermediate between the slow and rapid processes.
Accordingly, the main network flux proceeds on the neutron-rich unstable
isotopes up to 4-5 species off the valley of stability. The i process has been
clearly identified to be active in post-AGB stars during the Very Late Thermal
Pulse H-ingestion event, and a recent work infers about its important role in
early generations of stars. Here we demonstrate the effect of propagating
systematic nuclear uncertainties from different theoretical models to final
abundances for a region around the 2$^\mathrm{nd}$ peak at $A-Z=80$ for
elemental ratio predictions involving Ba, La and Eu in i-process conditions.
These elements are used to distinguish different n-capture contributions
observed in low-metallicity stars. For the simple 1-zone model adopted here,
predictions vary as much as a factor of 22 in on possible observational plane
([La/Eu] vs. [Ba/La]). To consider statistically correlated uncertainties, we
similarly perform a full nuclear physics uncertainty study within a given
Hauser-Feshbach model and demonstrate the role of correlations on the final
stellar abundance uncertainties. We show that in i-process conditions the main
result of neglecting correlations is to underestimate the impact of nuclear
uncertainties on the final nucleosynthesis yields by as much as two orders of
magnitude. (continued in document)

global properties (graph conductance, hitting or commute times, Katz score) or
local properties (Adamic-Adar and many variations, or node feature vectors),

exploit link densities at the intermediate level of communities. In this paper
we describe a discriminative LP algorithm that exploits two new signals. First,
a co-clustering algorithm provides community level link density estimates,
which are used to qualify observed links with a surprise value. Second, links
in the immediate neighborhood of the link to be predicted are not interpreted
at face value, but through a local model of node feature similarities. These
signals are combined into a discriminative link predictor. We evaluate the new
predictor using five diverse data sets that are standard in the literature. We
report on significant accuracy boosts compared to standard LP methods

contribution is a rigorous protocol for benchmarking and reporting LP

about the state of a quantum system, it is impossible to deterministically
predict the outcomes of all possible measurements. In comparison, the
perspective of a quantum observer allows to have quantum information about the

and quantum correlations. We provide an information theoretic analysis by
discussing entropic uncertainty relations with quantum side information.
  In the third part, we discuss the concept of randomness extractors. Classical
and quantum randomness are an essential resource in information theory,
cryptography, and computation. However, most sources of randomness exhibit only
weak forms of unpredictability, and the goal of randomness extraction is to
convert such weak randomness into (almost) perfect randomness. We discuss

examine especially the performance of these constructions relative to an

theorem can be understood as the use of a noisy channel to simulate a noiseless

problem: simulating noisy channels from noiseless ones. Starting from the
purely classical case (the classical reverse Shannon theorem), we develop
various kinds of quantum channel simulation results. We achieve this by using
classical and quantum randomness extractors that also work with respect to
quantum side information.

practical algorithms. In this paper we study an allocation problem for OFDMA

decompose resource allocation into two sub-problems: channel allocation under
deterministic power assignment and continuous power assignment optimization.
Channel allocation is formulated as the problem of finding the maximum weighted

weighted-degree greedy (MWDG) algorithm of which the approximation factor is
analyzed. For power allocation, an iterative power reassignment algorithm
(DPRA) is proposed. The control information requested to perform the allocation
is limited and the computational burden is shared between the base station and

of similar complexity. MWDG has excellent performance and outperforms all other

the simulations enter into a global non-spherical oscillation that is launched

circumferential flows collide at the antipode and cause the formation and
localized ignition of the next H-overabundant pocket. The cycle repeats for
more than a dozen times while its amplitude decreases. During the global
oscillation the entrainment rate increases temporarily by a factor $\approx
100$. Entrained entropy quenches convective motions in the upper layer until
the burning of entrained H establishes a separate convection zone. The

analyzed based on the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) approach to the
Hubbard model. A cluster embedded in a self-consistent bath is studied. With
increasing Coulomb repulsion, U, the antinodal point [k=(pi,0)] displays a
gradual suppression of spectral density of states around the Fermi energy which
is not observed at the nodal point [k=(pi/2,pi/2)]. The opening of the
antinodal pseudogap is related to the internal structure of the cluster and the
much weaker bath-cluster couplings at the antinodal than nodal point. The role
played by internal cluster correlations is elucidated from a simple four-level
model. For small U, the cluster levels form Kondo singlets with their baths
leading to a peak in the spectral density. As U is increased a localized state
is formed localizing the electrons in the cluster. If this cluster localized
state is non-degenerate, the Kondo effect is destroyed and a pseudogap opens up
in the spectra at the anti-nodal point. The pseudogap can be understood in
terms of destructive interference between different paths for electrons hopping
between the cluster and the bath. However, electrons at the nodal points remain
in Kondo states up to larger U since they are more strongly coupled to the
bath. The strong correlation between the (pi,0) and (0,pi) cluster levels in
the localized state leads to a large correlation energy gain which is important
for localizing electrons and opening up a pseudogap. Such scenario is in
contrast with two independent Mott transitions found in two-band systems with
different bandwidths in which the localized cluster electron does not correlate
strongly with any other cluster electron for intermediate U. The important
intracluster sector correlations are associated with the resonating valence
bond (RVB) character of the cluster.

of the stationary queue length in the M${}^X$/GI/1 retrial queue. The
stochastic-decomposition-like result shows that the stationary queue length

stationary conditional queue length distribution given that the server is idle;
and a certain matrix sequence associated with the stationary queue length

prove the subexponential tail equivalence of the stationary queue length

well-known model for financial time series. In these models, the extremes of
the log returns are mainly driven by the extremes of the i.i.d. innovation
sequence which leads to a very strong form of asymptotic independence, that is,
the coefficient of tail dependence is equal to $1/2$ for all positive lags. We
propose an alternative class of stochastic volatility models with heavy-tailed
volatilities and examine their extreme value behavior. In particular, it is
shown that, while lagged extreme observations are typically asymptotically
independent, their coefficient of tail dependence can take on any value between
$1/2$ (corresponding to exact independence) and 1 (related to asymptotic
dependence). Hence, this class allows for a much more flexible extremal
dependence between consecutive observations than classical SV models and can
thus describe the observed clustering of financial returns more realistically.
The extremal dependence structure of lagged observations is analyzed in the
framework of regular variation on the cone $(0,\infty)^d$. As two auxiliary
results which are of interest on their own we derive a new Breiman-type theorem
about regular variation on $(0,\infty)^d$ for products of a random matrix and a
regularly varying random vector and a statement about the joint extremal
behavior of products of i.i.d. regularly varying random variables.

turbulent flows at the bottom of convective zone. The cycle of magnetic-field
generation in this model can be represented in the form of sequency of
processes. There are vortexes with azimuth axis, similar with Taylor vortex,
close to the bottom of convection zone. This leads to the generation of twisted
flux tubes because of screw dynamo. The growth of magnetic field causes
emersion of U- loops. During the process of emersion and extraction azimuthal
field of flux tubes converts to axial field, and reaches the surface as bipolar
of sunspots with U-shaped configuration. Due to differential rotation residual
bipolar fields stretch out to the surface toroidal field and are shifted to the
bottom of the convective zone by means of meridional flow at high latitudes.
The direction of the toroidal field within the generation zone reverses its
sign, and the cycle is repeated.

scattering amplitudes of closed bosonic stringy states. These states arise due
to compactification of closed string to lower spacetime dimensions through
dimensional reduction. The amplitude, in the first quantized formalism, is
computed by introducing vertex operators. The amplitude is constructed by the
standard prescription and the vertex operators are required to respect
conformal invariance. Such vertex operators are constructed in the weak field
approximation. Therefore, the vertex operators of the stringy states of our
interest are to be defined accordingly. We propose a prescription to implement
T-duality on the three point functions and N-point functions. We argue that it
is possible to generate new amplitudes through the transformations on a given
amplitude just as T-duality transformations can take us to a new set of string

significantly improved by Ag doping on the insulating grain boundaries of YBCO.
Pure and Ag diffused YBCO superconducting samples are synthesized through solid
state reaction route. Both pure and Ag doped YBCO are superconducting at below
90K. Though, the Tc (R=0) of YBCO:Ag samples under applied field of 13 Tesla is
around 65K, the same is 45K for pure YBCO under same applied field. The upper
critical field [Hc2(0)], being estimated from R(T)H is around 70Tesla for
pristine sample, and is above 190Tesla for Ag doped samples. The boarding of
the resistive transition under applied magnetic field is comparatively less and
nearly single step for Ag doped samples, while the same is clearly two step and
relatively much larger for the pristine YBCO. The resistive broadening is
explained on the basis of changed inter-granular coupling and thermally
activated flux flow (TAFF). The TAFF activation energy (U0) is found to be
linear with applied magnetic field for all the samples, but with nearly an
order of magnitude less value for the Ag doped samples. Summarily, it is shown
that inclusion of Ag significantly improves the superconducting performance of
YBCO:Ag composites, in particular under applied field.

incompressible torsional Alfv\'en and kink magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves,
which are magnetically dominated waves supported by the Sun's pervasive and
complex magnetic field. In particular, propagating MHD kink waves have recently

intensity changes of up to one order of magnitude at both radial distances
considered here. The peak intensity variation with the radial distance for the
pair of observers located at the same angular position is also derived. This is
the first time that the latitudinal dependence of the peak intensity with the

$k-1$ or less members should have no information on the secret of other team

chosen independently and have size $s$, then each team member must have a share

when $s$ is large enough. This result shows a significant saving over $n$
independent applications of Shamir's $k$ out of $n-1$ threshold schemes which
assigns shares of size $(n-1)s$ to each team member independently of $k$.
  We also show how to set up such a scheme without any trusted dealer, and how

computer vision and can be often formalized as a problem of permutation
estimation. We address this problem from a statistical point of view and
provide a theoretical analysis of the accuracy of several natural estimators.
To this end, the minimax rate of separation is investigated and its expression
is obtained as a function of the sample size, noise level and dimension. We
consider the cases of homoscedastic and heteroscedastic noise and establish, in
each case, tight upper bounds on the separation distance of several estimators.
These upper bounds are shown to be unimprovable both in the homoscedastic and
heteroscedastic settings. Interestingly, these bounds demonstrate that a phase
transition occurs when the dimension $d$ of the features is of the order of the
logarithm of the number of features $n$. For $d=O(\log n)$, the rate is
dimension free and equals $\sigma (\log n)^{1/2}$, where $\sigma$ is the noise
level. In contrast, when $d$ is larger than $c\log n$ for some constant $c>0$,
the minimax rate increases with $d$ and is of the order $\sigma(d\log
n)^{1/4}$. We also discuss the computational aspects of the estimators and
provide empirical evidence of their consistency on synthetic data. Finally, we
show that our results extend to more general matching criteria.

different characteristics: in some GCs the population is dominated by binary
systems, in others by single pulsars and exotic systems that result from
exchange encounters. In this paper, we describe a second dynamical parameter
for globular clusters, the encounter rate for a single binary, gamma. We find
that this parameter provides a good characterization of the differences between
the pulsar populations of different globular clusters. The higher gamma is for
any particular globular cluster the more isolated pulsars and products of
exchange interactions are observed. Furthermore, we also find that slow and
""young"" pulsars are found almost exclusively in clusters with a high gamma;
this suggests that these kinds of objects are formed by the disruption of X-ray
binaries, thus halting the recycling of a previously dead neutron star. We
discuss the implications of this for the nature of young pulsars and for the

its very large duty cycle for micro-variations. Aims. We report here on the
long continuous optical micro-variability light curve of 0716+714 obtained
during the multi-site observing campaign during which the Blazar showed almost
constant variability over a 0.5 magnitude range. The resulting light curve is
presented here for the first time. Observations from participating
observatories were corrected for instrumental differences and combined to
construct the overall smoothed light curve. Methods. Thirty-six observatories
in sixteen countries participated in this continuous monitoring program and
twenty of them submitted data for compilation into a continuous light curve.
The light curve was analyzed using several techniques including Fourier
transform, Wavelet and noise analysis techniques. Those results led us to model
the light curve by attributing the variations to a series of synchrotron
pulses. Results. We have interpreted the observed microvariations in this
extended light curve in terms of a new model consisting of individual
stochastic pulses due to cells in a turbulent jet which are energized by a
passing shock and cool by means of synchrotron emission. We obtained an
excellent fit to the 72-hour light curve with the synchrotron pulse model.

surface modes. The results show that the heat current between the dipoles
placed in a cavity oscillates as a function of their position and distance and
can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude as compared to the free space
heat current with a similar interparticle distance. The predicted enhancement
can be viewed as a many-body generalization of the well-known cavity Purcell
effect. Similar effects are also observed in the interparticle heat transfer
between dipoles located next to a surface of a polar material supporting
surface phonon polaritons.

processes by examining the consistency with the observed variation of the
extinction curves in the Milky Way. We find that, if we simply use the
parameters used in previous studies, the model fails to explain the flattening
of far-UV extinction curve for large $R_V$ (flatness of optical extinction
curve) and the existence of carbon bump even in flat extinction curves. This
discrepancy is resolved by adopting a `tuned' model, in which coagulation of
carbonaceous dust is less efficient (by a factor of 2) and that of silicate is
more efficient with the coagulation threshold removed. The tuned model is also
consistent with the relation between silicon depletion (indicator of accretion)
and $R_V$ if the duration of accretion and coagulation is >100(n_H/10^3
cm^{-3})^{-1} Myr, where n_H is the number density of hydrogen nuclei in the
cloud. We also examine the relations between each of the extinction curve
features (UV slope, far-UV curvature, and carbon bump strength) and $R_V$. The
correlation between UV slope and $R_V$, which is the strongest among the three
correlations, is well reproduced by the tuned model. For far-UV curvature and
carbon bump strength, the observational data are located between the tuned
model and the original model without tuning, implying that the large scatters
in the observational data can be explained by the sensitive response to the
coagulation efficiency. The overall success of the tuned model indicates that
accretion and coagulation are promising mechanisms of producing the variation

and on the spatial Fourier spectrum analysis of the stylolite traces. We test
and show, on both synthetic and natural examples, that the information from
this outer cylindrical surface is equivalent to the one obtained from the
destructive planar sections traditionally used. The assessment of paleostress
from the stylolite morphology analysis is made using a recent theoretical
model, which links the morphological properties to the physical processes
acting during stylolite evolution. This model shows that two scaling regimes
are to be expected for the stylolite height power spectrum, separated by a
cross-over length that depends on the magnitude of the paleostress during
formation. We develop a non linear fit method to automatically extract the
cross-over lengths from the digitized stylolite profiles. Results on cores from
boreholes drilled in the surroundings of the Andra Underground Research
Laboratory located at Bure, France, show that different groups of sedimentary
stylolites can be distinguished, and correspond to different estimated vertical
paleostress values. For the Oxfordian formation, one group of stylolites
indicate a paleostress of around 10 MPa, while another group yields 15 MPa. For
the Dogger formation, two stylolites indicate a paleostress of around 10 MPa,
while others appear to have stopped growing at paleostresses between 30 and 22
MPa, starting at an erosion phase that initiated in the late Cretaceous and

zero, assuming that 0 is not a resonance. The first application we give is an
$L^p$ Sobolev estimate for $d+\delta$ and $\Delta_q$. Then we obtain a complete
characterization of the range of $p>1$ for which the Riesz transform for
$q$-forms $T_q=(d+\delta)\Delta_q^{-1/2}$ is bounded on $L^p$. Finally, we
obtain an asymptotic formula for the analytic torsion of a family of smooth
compact Riemannian manifolds $(\Omega_\epsilon,g_\epsilon)$ degenerating to a
compact manifold $(\Omega_0,g_0)$ with a conic singularity as $\epsilon\to 0$.

determining axisymmetric CMC-slices within the Kerr solution. We construct such

multiferroic bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3 or BFO), revealing the energetic and
vibrational features that control the occurrence of various relevant
structures. More precisely, we have studied the relative stability of four
low-energy BFO polymorphs by computing their free energies within the
quasi-harmonic approximation, introducing a practical scheme that allows us to
account for the main effects of spin disorder. As expected, we find that the
ferroelectric ground state of the material (with R3c space group) transforms
into an orthorhombic paraelectric phase (Pnma) upon heating. We show that this
transition is not significantly affected by magnetic disorder, and that the
occurrence of the Pnma structure relies on its being vibrationally (although
not elastically) softer than the R3c phase. We also investigate a
representative member of the family of nano-twinned polymorphs recently
predicted for BFO [Prosandeev et al., Adv. Funct. Mater. 23, 234 (2013)] and
discuss their possible stabilization at the boundaries separating the R3c and
Pnma regions in the corresponding pressure-temperature phase diagram. Finally,
we elucidate the intriguing case of the so-called super-tetragonal phases of
BFO: Our results explain why such structures have never been observed in the
bulk material, despite their being stable polymorphs of very low energy.
Quantitative comparison with experiment is provided whenever possible, and the
relative importance of various physical effects (zero-point motion, spin
fluctuations, thermal expansion) and technical features (employed
exchange-correlation energy density functional) is discussed. Our work attests
the validity and usefulness of the quasi-harmonic scheme to investigate the
phase diagram of this complex oxide, and prospective applications are
discussed.

networks has been extensively studied. In this paper, other than traditional
full interaction, we propose a partial interaction based spreading model,
considering that the informed individuals would transmit information to only a
certain fraction of their neighbors due to the transmission ability in
real-world social networks. Simulation results on three representative networks
(BA, ER, WS) indicate that the spreading efficiency is highly correlated with
the network heterogeneity. In addition, a special phenomenon, namely
\emph{Information Blind Areas} where the network is separated by several
information-unreachable clusters, will emerge from the spreading process.
Furthermore, we also find that the size distribution of such information blind
areas obeys power-law-like distribution, which has very similar exponent with
that of site percolation. Detailed analyses show that the critical value is
decreasing along with the network heterogeneity for the spreading process,
which is complete the contrary to that of random selection. Moreover, the
critical value in the latter process is also larger that of the former for the
same network. Those findings might shed some lights in in-depth understanding
the effect of network properties on information spreading.

extinction periodicity first detected by Raup and Sepkoski (1984) for only the
post-Paleozoic actually runs through the entire Phanerozoic. Although there is
not a local peak of extinction every 27 million years, an excess of the
fraction of genus extinction by interval follows a 27 million year timing
interval and differs from a random distribution at the p ~ 0.02 level. A 27
million year periodicity in the spectrum of interval lengths no longer appears,
removing the question of a possible artifact arising from it. Using a method
originally developed in Bambach (2006) we identify 19 intervals of marked
extinction intensity, including mass extinctions, spanning the last 470 million
years (and with another six present in the Cambrian) and find that 10 of the 19
lie within 3 Myr of the maxima in the spacing of the 27 Myr periodicity, which
differs from a random distribution at the p = 0.004 level. These 19 intervals
of marked extinction intensity also preferentially occur during decreasing
diversity phases of a well-known 62 Myr periodicity in diversity (16 of 19, p =
0.002). Both periodicities appear to enhance the likelihood of increased
severity of extinction, but the cause of neither periodicity is known.
Variations in the strength of the many suggested causes of extinction coupled
to the variation in combined effect of the two different periodicities as they
shift in and out of phase is surely one of the reasons that definitive
comparative study of the causes of major extinction events is so elusive.

applications and attracted much attention recently. There are two principle
types of MCS, one is the Rigid Multiple Camera System (RMCS); the other is the
Articulated Camera System (ACS). In a RMCS, the relative poses (relative 3-D
position and orientation) between the cameras are invariant. While, in an ACS,
the cameras are articulated through movable joints, the relative pose between
them may change. Therefore, through calibration of an ACS we want to find not
only the relative poses between the cameras but also the positions of the
joints in the ACS.
  In this paper, we developed calibration algorithms for the ACS using a simple
constraint: the joint is fixed relative to the cameras connected with it during
the transformations of the ACS. When the transformations of the cameras in an
ACS can be estimated relative to the same coordinate system, the positions of
the joints in the ACS can be calculated by solving linear equations. However,
in a non-overlapping view ACS, only the ego-transformations of the cameras and
can be estimated. We proposed a two-steps method to deal with this problem. In
both methods, the ACS is assumed to have performed general transformations in a
static environment. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed methods are
tested by simulation and real experiments. In the real experiment, the
intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the ACS are obtained simultaneously by
our calibration procedure using the same image sequences, no extra data
capturing step is required. The corresponding trajectory is recovered and
illustrated using the calibration results of the ACS. Since the estimated
translations of different cameras in an ACS may scaled by different scale
factors, a scale factor estimation algorithm is also proposed. To our
knowledge, we are the first to study the calibration of ACS.

computational and memory requirements of the parser below that of the SDP
solver itself. We have re-developed the internal structure of our polynomial
decision variables. Specifically, polynomial and SOS variable declarations made
using sossosvar, sospolyvar, sosmatrixvar, etc now return a new polynomial
structure, dpvar. This new polynomial structure, is documented in the enclosed
dpvar guide, and isolates the scalar SDP decision variables in the SOS program
from the independent variables used to construct the SOS program. As a result,
the complexity of the parser scales almost linearly in the number of decision
variables. As a result of these changes, almost all users will notice a
significant increase in speed, with large-scaleproblems experiencing the most
dramatic speedups. Parsing time is now always less than 10% of time spent in
the SDP solver. Finally, SOSTOOLS now provides support for the MOSEK solver
interface as well as the SeDuMi, SDPT3, CSDP, SDPNAL, SDPNAL+, and SDPA
solvers.

unusual complex structures that follow the body-centered and face-centered
cubic structures on compression. The structural sequence of potassium under
compression to 1 Megabar is as follows: bcc - fcc - h-g (tI19*), hP4 - oP8 -
tI4 - oC16. We consider configurations of Brillouin-Jones zones and the Fermi
surface within a nearly-free-electron model in order to analyze the importance
of these configurations for the crystal structure energy that contains two main
contributions: electrostatic (Ewald) and electronic (band structure) energies.
The latter can be lowered due to a formation of Brillouin zone planes close to
the Fermi surface opening an energy gap at these planes. Under pressure, the
band structure energy term becomes more important leading to a formation of
complex low-symmetry structures. The stability of the post-fcc phases in K is
attributed to the changes in the valence electron configuration implying the
overlap of valence band with the upper core electrons. This effect offers an
understanding of structural complexity of alkali metals under strong
compression.

through this medium but there is also an auxiliary, passive receiver array that

on the near side of the object. The imaging is done with travel time migration
using the cross correlations of the passive array data. We showed in [J.

the source array is infinite, (ii) the scattering medium is modeled by either
an isotropic random medium in the paraxial regime or a randomly layered medium,

analyze the resolution of the image when both the source array and the passive

capability of INTEGRAL for the spectral analysis. We observed 15 outbursts,
seven of which we report here for the first time. This data analysis almost
doubles the statistics of flares of this binary system detected by INTEGRAL. A
refined timing analysis did not reveal a significant periodicity in the
INTEGRAL observation where a ~21s pulsation was previously detected. Neither
did we find evidence for pulsations in the X-ray light curve of an archival

above 8 Msun. Hence, accurate knowledge of the rotation rates of such massive
stars is critical for understanding their properties and for constraining
models of their evolution. Aims: This paper investigates the reliability of
current methods used to derive projected rotation speeds v sin i from
line-broadening signatures in the photospheric spectra of massive stars,
focusing on stars that are not rapidly rotating. Methods: We use slowly
rotating magnetic O-stars with well-determined rotation periods to test the
Fourier transform (FT) and goodness-of-fit (GOF) methods typically used to
infer projected rotation rates of massive stars. Results: For our two magnetic
test stars with measured rotation periods longer than one year, i.e., with v
sin i < 1 km/s, we derive v sin i ~ 40-50 km/s from both the FT and GOF
methods. These severe overestimates are most likely caused by an insufficient
treatment of the competing broadening mechanisms referred to as microturbulence
and macroturbulence. Conclusions: These findings warn us not to rely
uncritically on results from current standard techniques to derive projected
rotation speeds of massive stars in the presence of significant additional line
broadening, at least when v sin i <~ 50 km/s. This may, for example, be crucial
for i) determining the statistical distribution of observed rotation rates of
massive stars, ii) interpreting the evolutionary status and spin-down histories
of rotationally braked B-supergiants, and iii) explaining the deficiency of
observed O-stars with spectroscopically inferred v sin i ~ 0 km/s. Further
investigations of potential shortcomings of the above techniques are presently
under way.

checking. We adapt the general definition of robustness introduced by Kitano to
the class of stochastic systems modelled as continuous time Markov Chains in
order to extensively analyse and compare robustness of biological models with
uncertain parameters. The framework utilises novel computational methods that
enable to effectively evaluate the robustness of models with respect to
quantitative temporal properties and parameters such as reaction rate constants
and initial conditions.
  The framework is applied to gene regulation as an example of a central
biological mechanism where intrinsic and extrinsic stochasticity plays crucial
role due to low numbers of DNA and RNA molecules. Using our methods we have
obtained a comprehensive and precise analysis of stochastic dynamics under
parameter uncertainty. Furthermore, we apply our framework to compare several
variants of two-component signalling networks from the perspective of
robustness with respect to intrinsic noise caused by low populations of
signalling components. We succeeded to extend previous studies performed on
deterministic models (ODE) and show that stochasticity may significantly affect
obtained predictions. Our case studies demonstrate that the framework can
provide deeper insight into the role of key parameters in maintaining the
system functionality and thus it significantly contributes to formal methods in
computational systems biology.

metal interface is investigated theoretically. We show that the excitation of
localized eigenmodes of the cavity allows one to efficiently excite the surface
plasmon polariton (SPP). We exploit the polarization and symmetry properties of
the cavity modes to propose an efficient approach for controlling the SPP
intensity through an external magnetic field. The presented theoretical
predictions are in good agreement with the rigorous computations based on the
generalized Lorentz reciprocity theorem and aperiodic Fourier modal method. The
magnetization-induced relative intensity variation of the excited SPP
demonstrated in numerical computations varies from a few percent to 100%
depending on the polarization of the incident wave. Such large modulation opens
new possibilities for efficient SPP modulation with considered magneto-optical
intensity effect.

to date among more than 700 targets observed during our long-term

unusual binary. The measured near-UV and optical U band fluxes exceed those
expected for comparable M5.0V stars, and excess flux is also detected in the

HST-STIS+MAMA images at 1820A and 2700A, and our analysis shows that it is
probably a rare, cool, white dwarf with T = 4600-5500K. Given the long-term

excellent, although as yet we can only provide limits on the unusual

the heliosphere and investigate the cause of the observed sharp plasma beta
transition. Specifically, we consider a strong internal magnetic field and an
explosive fast start, such that the plasma beta is significantly lower in the
FR than the sheath region that is formed ahead. This leads to an unusual FR
morphology in the first stage of propagation, while the more traditional view
(e.g. from space weather simulations like Enlil) of a `pancake' shaped FR is
observed as it approaches 1 AU. We investigate how an equipartition line,
defined by a magnetic Weber number, surrounding a core region of a propagating
FR can demarcate a boundary layer where there is a sharp transition in the
plasma beta. The substructure affects the distribution of toroidal flux, with
the majority of the flux remaining in a small core region which maintains a
quasi-cylindrical structure. Quantitatively, we investigate a locus of points
where the kinetic energy density of the relative inflow field is equal to the
energy density of the transverse magnetic field (i.e. effective tension force).
The simulation provides compelling evidence that at all heliocentric distances
the distribution of toroidal magnetic flux away from the FR axis is not linear;
with 80% of the toroidal flux occurring within 40% of the distance from the FR
axis. Thus our simulation displays evidence that the competing ideas of a
pancaking structure observed remotely can coexist with a quasi-cylindrical
magnetic structure seen in situ.

is becoming an important concept in modern physics. Nanomechanical resonators
are ideal systems for studying synchronization due to their controllable
oscillation properties and engineerable nonlinearities. Here we demonstrate
synchronization of two nanomechanical oscillators via a photonic resonator,
enabling optomechanical synchronization between mechanically isolated
nanomechanical resonators. Optical backaction gives rise to both reactive and
dissipative coupling of the mechanical resonators, leading to coherent
oscillation and mutual locking of resonators with dynamics beyond the widely
accepted phase oscillator (Kuramoto) model. Besides the phase difference
between the oscillators, also their amplitudes are coupled, resulting in the
emergence of sidebands around the synchronized carrier signal.

near the enhanced symmetry point (ESP). We focus on non-renormalizable
couplings between the moduli field and the field that becomes light at the ESP.
Considering higher dimensional interaction, we find that particle production is
significant in a large area, which is even larger than the area that is
expected from a renormalizable interaction. It is possible to find this
possibility from a trivial adiabatic condition; however the quantitative
estimation of particle production and trapping of the field in motion are far
from trivial. In this paper we study particle production and trapping in
detail, using both the analytical and numerical calculations, to find a clear
and intuitive result that supports trapping in a vast variety of theories. Our
study shows that trapping driven by a non-renormalizable interaction is
possible. This possibility has not been considered in previous works. Some
phenomenological models of particle physics will be mentioned to complement
discussion.

most accurate measurement of the radial and non-radial oscillation patterns.
This accuracy is a prerequisite for making the best with asteroseismic data.
From radial modes, we derive proxies of the stellar mass and radii with an
unprecedented accuracy for field stars. For dozens of subgiants and thousands
of red giants, the identification of mixed modes (corresponding to gravity
waves propagating in the core coupled to pressure waves propagating in the
envelope) indicates unambiguously their evolutionary status. As probes of the
stellar core, these mixed modes also reveal the internal differential rotation
and show the spinning down of the core rotation of stars ascending the red
giant branch. A toy model of the coupling of waves constructing mixed modes is
exposed, for illustrating many of their features.

valued in arbitrary crossed module and over an arbitrary differential stack. We
do it using only Lie groupoids, hence ordinary differential geometry, by
considering differential stacks as being Lie groupoids up to Morita
equivalence. We prove the coincidence with the existing notions by comparing
our construction with non-Abelian cohomology. More precisely, we introduce the
key notion of extension of Lie groupoids valued in a crossed-module. We relate
it with Dedecker's non-Abelian 1-cocycles, and we then show that Morita
equivalence amounts to co-boundaries, paving the way for a general definition
of gerbes valued in a crossed-module over a differential stack. In the second
chapter, we develop the theory of Nijenhuis forms on L-infinity-algebras.
First, we recall a convenient notion of Richardson-Nijenhuis bracket on the
graded symmetric vector valued forms on a graded vector space, bracket for
which L-infinity-algebras are simply Poisson elements. Weak Nijenhuis vector
valued forms for a given L-infinity-algebra are defined to be forms of degree 0
deforming (i.e. taking bracket) that Poisson element into an other Poisson
element. Nijenhuis forms are those forms N for which deforming twice by N is
like deforming once by a form K called the square of N. We obtain in this
context an infnite hierarchy of L-infinity-algebras. classifcation of Nijenhuis
forms on anchor-free Lie 2-algebras can be completed. We also show that there
is, under adequate conditions, a one to one correspondence between the
Nijenhuis vector valued forms N with respect to the Lie 2-algebra associated to
a Courant algebroid and Nijenhuis C-infinity-linear maps on the Courant
algebroid itself. We give examples of Nijenhuis vector valued forms on the Lie
n-algebras associated to n-plectic manifolds.

pattern recognition research, there is no technique that yields the best
classification in all scenarios. Therefore, the consideration of as many as

aiming at high accuracy. Typical works comparing methods either emphasize the
performance of a given algorithm in validation tests or systematically compare
various algorithms, assuming that the practical use of these methods is done by

practical classification tasks without an in-depth knowledge about the
underlying mechanisms behind parameters. Actually, the adequate choice of
classifiers and parameters alike in such practical circumstances constitutes a
long-standing problem and is the subject of the current paper. We carried out a
study on the performance of nine well-known classifiers implemented by the Weka
framework and compared the dependence of the accuracy with their configuration
parameter configurations. The analysis of performance with default parameters
revealed that the k-nearest neighbors method exceeds by a large margin the
other methods when high dimensional datasets are considered. When other
configuration of parameters were allowed, we found that it is possible to
improve the quality of SVM in more than 20% even if parameters are set
randomly. Taken together, the investigation conducted in this paper suggests
that, apart from the SVM implementation, Weka's default configuration of
parameters provides an performance close the one achieved with the optimal
configuration.

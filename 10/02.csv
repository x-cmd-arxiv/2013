be extracted magnetically from a Kerr black hole is explored, using a
semi-analytic, ideal MHD model that incorporates plasma injection on magnetic
field lines. We find a critical load below which the specific energy of the
plasma inflowing into the black hole is negative, and above which it is
positive, and identify two types of flows with distinct properties; at
sub-critical loads a magnetic outflow is launched from the ergosphere, owing to
extraction of the black hole spin energy, as originally proposed by Blandford
and Znajek. At super-critical loads the structure of the flow depends on the
details of the injection process. In cases where the injected plasma is
relativistically hot, a pressure driven, double trans-magnetosonic flow is
launched from a stagnation point located outside the ergosphere, between the
inner and outer light cylinders. Some fraction of the energy deposited in the
magnetosphere is then absorbed by the black hole and the rest emerges at
infinity in the form of a relativistic outflow. When the injected plasma is
cold an outflow may not form at all. We discuss the implications of our results
to gamma ray bursts and active galactic nuclei.

sensitivity of the size of these tests to the underlying background pattern

clustering and number of clusters, or differences in relative abundances of the

fit to the average spectrum of Seyfert 2s and spectra of individual type 2

IRAS F10214+4724. This is mainly due to the fact that the nuSnu distribution of
the galaxy falls very steeply with increasing frequency (a characteristic that
is usually indicative of heavy absorption by dust) but shows a silicate feature
in emission. Such emission features are not expected in sources with
optical/near-infrared type 2 AGN spectral signatures. The Herschel data show
that there is more power emitted in the rest-frame 20-50um wavelength range
compared with the model presented by Efstathiou which assumes three components
of emission: an edge-on torus, clouds (at a temperature of 610 and 200K) that
are associated with the narrow-line region (NLR) and a highly obscured
starburst that dominates in the submillimetre. We present a revised version of
that model that assumes an additional component of emission which we associate
with NLR clouds at a temperature of 100K. The 100K dust component could also be
explained by a highly obscured hot starburst. The model suggests that the NLR
of IRAS F10214+4724 has an unusually high covering factor (>= 17%) or more

surface sheets whose geometry suggests spin uctuations and a possible
instability toward long-range ordering at the nesting vector. In fact, a
complex magnetic phase-diagram is indeed observed in the isostructural NaFeAs

the existence of both hole and electron-like surfaces, but with rather distinct
cross-sectional areas and an absence of the nesting that is thought to underpin
both magnetic order and superconductivity in the pnictide family of
superconductors. These ARPES observations were challenged by subsequent de Haas
van Alphen (dHvA) measurements which detected a few, electron like Fermi
surface sheets in rough agreement with the original band calculations. Here, we
show a detailed dHvA study unveiling additional, small and nearly isotropic
Fermi surface sheets in LiFeAs single crystals, which ought to correspond to
hole-like orbits, as previously observed by ARPES. Therefore, our results
conciliate the apparent discrepancy between ARPES and the previous dHvA
results5. The small size of these Fermi surface pockets suggests a prominent
role for the electronic correlations in LiFeAs. The absence of gap nodes, in
combination with the coexistence of quasi-two-dimensional and three-dimensional
Fermi surfaces, favor a s-wave pairing symmetry for LiFeAs. But similar
electron-like Fermi surfaces combined with very different hole pockets between
LiFeAs and LiFeP, suggest that the nodes in the gap function of LiFeP might be
located on the hole-pockets.

that the bulk superconducting transition occurs at about 5 K, while an
unexpected giant superconducting fluctuation appears at temperatures as high as
2-4 kBTC. Analysis based on the anisotropic Ginzbaug-Landau theory gives an
anisotropy of 30-45. Two gap features with magnitudes of about 3.5+-0.3 meV and

associated with the bulk superconducting transition at about 5 K yielding a
huge ratio 2Delta_s/kBTc =16.8, the larger gap remains up to about 26 K. The
normal state recovered by applying a high magnetic field shows an anomalous

rough boundary conditions by means of rheometry coupled to local velocity
measurements. Under an applied shear stress, the fluidization of gels made of
attractive carbon black particles suspended in a mineral oil is shown to
involve a previously unreported shear rate response $\dot \gamma (t)$
characterized by two well-defined and separated timescales $\tau_c$ and
$\tau_f$. First $\dot \gamma(t)$ decreases as a weak power law strongly
reminiscent of the primary creep observed in numerous crystalline and amorphous
solids, coined the ""Andrade creep."" We show that the bulk deformation remains
homogeneous at the micron scale, which demonstrates that if plastic events take
place or if any shear transformation zone exists, such phenomena occur at a
smaller scale. As a key result of this paper, the duration $\tau_c$ of this
creep regime decreases as a power law of the viscous stress, defined as the
difference between the applied stress and the yield stress with an exponent
ranging between 2 and 3 depending on the gel concentration. The end of this
first regime is marked by a jump of the shear rate by several orders of
magnitude, while the gel slowly slides as a solid block experiencing strong
wall slip at both walls, despite rough boundary conditions. Finally, a second
sudden increase of the shear rate is concomitant to the full fluidization of
the material which ends up being homogeneously sheared. The corresponding
fluidization time $\tau_f$ robustly follows an exponential decay with the
applied shear stress as already reported for smooth boundary conditions.
Finally, we highlight a few features that are common to attractive colloidal
gels and to solid materials by discussing our results in the framework of
theoretical approaches of solid rupture (kinetic, fiber bundle, and transient
network models).

reverse evolution a neutron star (NS) or a potential NS-progenitor massive core

condensate in a toroidal trap is studied both in the miscible and immiscible
regimes. In the miscible regime we show that superflow decay is related to
linear instabilities of the spin-density Bogoliubov mode. We find a region of
partial stability, where the flow is stable in the majority component while it
decays in the minority component. We also characterize the dynamical
instability appearing for a large relative velocity between the two components.
In the immiscible regime the stability criterion is modified and depends on the
specific density distribution of the two components. The effect of a coherent
coupling between the two components is also discussed.

population of individuals located on a connected graph. Each agent is
characterized by her opinion, where the set of opinions is represented by a
finite sequence of consecutive integers, and each pair of neighbors, as defined
by the edge set of the graph, interact at a constant rate. The dynamics depends
on two parameters: the number of opinions denoted by $F$ and a so-called
confidence threshold denoted by $\theta$. If the opinion distance between two
interacting agents exceeds the confidence threshold then nothing happens,
otherwise one of the two agents mimics the other one just as in the classical
voter model. Our main result shows that the one-dimensional system starting
from any product measures with a positive density of each opinion fluctuates

Customers have different interpretations of the level of risk associated with
committing to pass over the control over the consumption schedule of their
devices to an operator, and these risk levels are only privately known. The
operator maximizes his expected profit of operating the DLS program by posting
the right participation incentives for different appliance types, in a publicly

dynamic decision making problem of whether to take the incentives and
participate or not. We define an optimization framework to determine the

the utility that the operator expects to gain from recruiting different types
of devices. These utilities also provide an upper-bound on the benefits that

review of such slow changes is largely, though not entirely, restricted to
internally-driven processes that can be distinguished from evolution driven by
galaxy interactions. It both describes our current understanding of disk
evolution, and identifies areas where more work is needed. Stellar disks are
heated through spiral scattering, which increases random motion components in
the plane, while molecular clouds redirect some fraction of the random energy
into vertical motion. The recently discovered process of radial migration at
the corotation resonance of a transient spiral mode does not alter the
underlying structure of the disk, since it neither heats the disk nor causes it
to spread, but it does have a profound effect on the expected distribution of
metallicities among the disk stars. Bars in disks are believed to be major
drivers of secular evolution through interactions with the outer disk and with
the halo. Once the material that makes up galaxy disks is converted into stars,
their overall angular momentum distribution cannot change by much, but that of
the gas is generally far more liable to rearrangement, allowing rings and
pseudo-bulges to form. While simulations are powerful tools from which we have
learned a great deal, those of disks may suffer from collisional relaxation
that requires some results to be interpreted with caution.

and physically motivated models are used to fully describe the emission-line

accretion disk in Swift J1910.2-0546 appears to be truncated, with an inner
radius of \rin$=9.4^{+1.7}_{-1.3}$\rg\ at a 90% confidence limit.
Quasi-periodic oscillations are also found at approximately 4.5 and 6 hz, which

Assuming that the line emission traces the ISCO, as would generally be expected
for an intermediate state, the current observation of Swift J1910.2-0546 may

intriguing possibility, there are also a number of alternative scenarios which
do not require a retrograde spin. For example, the inner accretion disk may be
truncated at an unusually high luminosity in this case, potentially suffering
frequent evaporation/condensation, or it could instead be persistently
evacuated through mass loss in a relativistic jet. Further observations are
required to distinguish between these different interpretations.

DNA sequencing platforms requires special attention. In particular, the
per-sample library sizes often vary by orders of magnitude from the same
sequencing run, and the counts are overdispersed relative to a simple Poisson
model These challenges can be addressed using an appropriate mixture model that
simultaneously accounts for library size differences and biological
variability. This approach is already well-characterized and implemented for
RNA-Seq data in R packages such as edgeR and DESeq.
  We use statistical theory, extensive simulations, and empirical data to show
that variance stabilizing normalization using a mixture model like the negative
binomial is appropriate for microbiome count data. In simulations detecting
differential abundance, normalization procedures based on a Gamma-Poisson
mixture model provided systematic improvement in performance over crude
proportions or rarefied counts -- both of which led to a high rate of false
positives. In simulations evaluating clustering accuracy, we found that the
rarefying procedure discarded samples that were nevertheless accurately
clustered by alternative methods, and that the choice of minimum library size
threshold was critical in some settings, but with an optimum that is unknown in
practice. Techniques that use variance stabilizing transformations by modeling
microbiome count data with a mixture distribution, such as those implemented in
edgeR and DESeq, substantially improved upon techniques that attempt to
normalize by rarefying or crude proportions. Based on these results and
well-established statistical theory, we advocate that investigators avoid
rarefying altogether. We have provided microbiome-specific extensions to these
tools in the R package, phyloseq.

low dimensional manifold is the basis of manifold learning. The goal of this
paper is to develop an algorithm (with accompanying complexity guarantees) for
fitting a manifold to an unknown probability distribution supported in a
separable Hilbert space, only using i.i.d samples from that distribution. More
precisely, our setting is the following. Suppose that data are drawn
independently at random from a probability distribution $P$ supported on the
unit ball of a separable Hilbert space $H$. Let $G(d, V, \tau)$ be the set of
submanifolds of the unit ball of $H$ whose volume is at most $V$ and reach
(which is the supremum of all $r$ such that any point at a distance less than
$r$ has a unique nearest point on the manifold) is at least $\tau$. Let $L(M,
P)$ denote mean-squared distance of a random point from the probability
distribution $P$ to $M$.
  We obtain an algorithm that tests the manifold hypothesis in the following
sense.
  The algorithm takes i.i.d random samples from $P$ as input, and determines
which of the following two is true (at least one must be):
  (a) There exists $M \in G(d, CV, \frac{\tau}{C})$ such that $L(M, P) \leq C
\epsilon.$
  (b) There exists no $M \in G(d, V/C, C\tau)$ such that $L(M, P) \leq
\frac{\epsilon}{C}.$
  The answer is correct with probability at least $1-\delta$.

state of the Corona Borealis Supercluster (CSC), a highly dense and compact
supercluster at z = 0.07. The Fundamental Plane relation is used to determine
redshift independent distances to six clusters in the densest region of the
supercluster, with mean accuracy in the relative distance estimates of 4 per
cent. Peculiar velocities determined from these distance estimates indicate
that the clusters have broken from the Hubble Flow, suggesting that the CSC
likely contains two regions that have reached turnaround and are currently
undergoing gravitational collapse. These results provide the strongest
observational evidence to date that the CSC is a bound system similar to the
much more extensive Shapley Supercluster, which is the most extensive confirmed
bound supercluster yet identified in the Universe. When compared with
simulations of the CSC our results require substantially more mass than is
contained within the clusters, possibly indicating a significant inter-cluster
dark matter component. In order to facilitate comparison with studies for which
spectroscopic data are not available, an alternative analysis of the dynamics
is made using the Kormendy relation as a distance indicator. The results are
generally consistent with those of the Fundamental Plane and suggest similar
global dynamics, but we find that the relatively sparse sampling of the
clusters makes the Kormendy relation less reliable overall and more susceptible
to small systematic differences between the cluster samples.

that form too early and therefore are too dense. We find the tension between
observations and simulations adopting parameters consistent with WMAP9 is
greatly diminished making the satellites a sensitive test of CDM. We find the
Via Lactea II halo to be atypical for haloes in a WMAP3 cosmology, a
discrepancy that we attribute to its earlier formation epoch than the mean for
its mass. We also explore warm dark matter (WDM) cosmologies for 1--4 keV
thermal relics. In 1 keV cosmologies subhaloes have circular velocities at kpc
scales ~ 60% lower than their CDM counterparts, but are reduced by only 10% in
4 keV cosmologies. Since relic masses < 2-3 keV are ruled out by constraints
from the number of Milky Way satellites and Lyman-\alpha\ forest, WDM has a
minor effect in reducing the densities of massive satellites. Given the
uncertainties on the mass and formation epoch of the Milky Way, the need for
reducing the satellite densities with baryonic effects or WDM is alleviated.

dynamic, and evolves according to a geometric random walk. We view the scenario
as an optimization problem where agents aim to learn the true state while
suffering the smallest possible loss. Based on the decomposition of the global
loss function, we introduce two update mechanisms, each of which generates an
estimate of the true state. We establish a tight bound on the rate of change of
the underlying state, under which individuals can track the parameter with a
bounded variance. Then, we characterize explicit expressions for the steady
state mean-square deviation(MSD) of the estimates from the truth, per
individual. We observe that only one of the estimators recovers the optimal
MSD, which underscores the impact of the objective function decomposition on
the learning quality. Finally, we provide an upper bound on the regret of the
proposed methods, measured as an average of errors in estimating the parameter

  Purpose: Systematically investigate the polarization and mean-field models,
implemented within self-consistent approaches that use identical interactions
and model spaces, so as to find reasons for the conflicts between them.
  Methods: For density-dependent interactions and with pairing correlations
included, we derive and study links between the mean-field and polarization
results obtained for energies of odd nuclei. We also identify and discuss
differences between the polarization-correction and full
particle-vibration-coupling (PVC) models. Numerical calculations are performed
for the mean-field ground-state properties of deformed odd nuclei and then
compared to the polarization corrections determined by using the approach that
conserves spherical symmetry.
  Results: We have identified and numerically evaluated self-interaction (SI)
energies that are at the origin of different results obtained within the
mean-field and polarization-correction approaches.
  Conclusions: Mean-field energies of odd nuclei are polluted by the SI
energies, and this makes them different from those obtained by using
polarization-correction methods. A comparison of both approaches allows for the
identification and determination of the SI terms, which then can be calculated
and removed from the mean-field results, giving the self-interaction-free
energies. The simplest deformed mean-field approach that does not break parity

are obtained when different diagnostic methods are employed - fitting the
unsaturated UV resonance lines (e.g. P v) gives drastically lower values than
obtained from the H{\alpha} emission. Wind clumping may be the main cause for
this discrepancy. In a previous paper, we have presented 3-D Monte-Carlo
calculations for the formation of scattering lines in a clumped stellar wind.
In the present paper we select five O-type supergiants (from O4 to O7) and test
whether the reported discrepancies can be resolved this way. In the first step,
the analyses start with simulating the observed spectra with Potsdam Wolf-Rayet
(PoWR) non-LTE model atmospheres. The mass-loss rates are adjusted to fit best
to the observed H{\alpha} emission lines. For the unsaturated UV resonance
lines (i.e. P v) we then apply our 3-D Monte-Carlo code, which can account for
wind clumps of any optical depths, a non-void inter-clump medium, and a
velocity dispersion inside the clumps. The ionization stratifications and
underlying photospheric spectra are adopted from the PoWR models. From fitting
the observed resonance line profiles, the properties of the wind clumps are
constrained. Our results show that with the mass-loss rates that fit H{\alpha}
(and other Balmer and He II lines), the UV resonance lines (especially the
unsaturated doublet of P v) can also be reproduced without problem when
macroclumping is taken into account. There is no need to artificially reduce
the mass-loss rates, nor to assume a sub-solar phosphorus abundance or an
extremely high clumping factor, contrary to what was claimed by other authors.
These consistent mass-loss rates are lower by a factor of 1.3 to 2.6, compared
to the mass-loss rate recipe from Vink et al. Macroclumping resolves the
previously reported discrepancy between H{\alpha} and P v mass-loss
diagnostics.

performed via a reduction of the phase-space distribution function onto a
collection of finite-sized macro-particles of arbitrary shape and
discretization of field quantities onto a spatial grid. This approach may be
used with both lab frame coordinates or moving window coordinates; the latter
can greatly improve computational efficiency for studying some types of
laser-plasma interactions. The primary advantage of the variational approach is
the preservation of Lagrangian symmetries, which in our case leads to energy
conservation and thus avoids difficulties with grid heating. Additionally, this
approach decouples particle size from grid spacing and relaxes restrictions on
particle shape, leading to low numerical noise. The variational approach also
guarantees consistent approximations in the equations of motion and is amenable
to higher order methods in both space and time. We restrict our attention to
the 1-1/2 dimensional case (one coordinate and two momenta). Simulations are
performed with the new models and demonstrate energy conservation and low

considered. The comparison of the actions of the perturbed paths with that of
the Newtonian path reveals the existence of extrema of action which are minima
for zero or very weak friction and shift to maxima when the motion is
overdamped. In the intermediate case, the action of the Newtonian path is
neither least nor most, meaning that the extreme feature of the Newtonian path
is lost. In this situation, however, no reliable evidence of stationary action
can be found from the simulation result.

distribution of red giant branch (RGB) stars starting at ~ 10"", which poses a
theoretical problem, because the GC should have formed a segregated cusp of old
stars. This issue has been addressed invoking stellar collisions, massive black
hole binaries, and infalling star clusters, which can explain it to some
extent. Another observational fact, key to the work presented here, is the
presence of a stellar disk at the GC. We postulate that the reason for the
missing stars in the RGB is closely intertwined with the disk formation, which
initially was gaseous and went through a fragmentation phase to form the stars.
Using simple analytical estimates, we prove that during fragmentation the disk
developed regions with densities much higher than a homogeneous gaseous disk,
i.e. ""clumps"", which were optically thick, and hence contracted slowly. Stars
in the GC interacted with them and in the case of RGB stars, the clumps were
dense enough to totally remove their outer envelopes after a relatively low
number of impacts. Giant stars in the horizontal branch (HB), however, have
much denser envelopes. Hence, the fragmentation phase of the disk must have had
a lower impact in their distribution, because it was more difficult to remove
their envelopes. We predict that future deeper observations of the GC should
reveal less depletion of HB stars and that the released dense cores of RGB
stars will still be populating the GC.

ancillary photometry at shorter wavelengths. We compared the observed SEDs to a

used the relative figure of merit estimated from the Bayesian inference of each
disk parameter to analyse the structural properties. We detected 12 Class II
brown dwarfs with Herschel, which corresponds to one-third of all currently
known brown dwarf members of Rho Ophiuchi. We do not detect any of the known
Class III brown dwarfs. Comparison to models reveals that the disks are best
described by an inner radius between 0.01 and 0.07 AU, and a flared disk
geometry with a flaring index between 1.05 and 1.2. Furthermore, we can exclude
values of the disk scale-height lower than 10 AU (measured at a fiducial radius

fitting their spectra using our inhomogeneous jet model with an accelerating,
magnetically dominated, parabolic base, which transitions to a slowly
decelerating conical jet with a geometry based on observations of M87. Our
model is able to fit very well to the simultaneous multiwavelength spectra of
all the BL Lacs including radio observations. We find that the BL Lacs have
lower jet powers and bulk Lorentz factors than the sample of Compton-dominant
blazars investigated in Paper III, consistent with the blazar sequence.
Excitingly, we find a correlation between the radius at which the jet first
comes into equipartition and the jet power, in agreement with our prediction
from Paper II. We interpret this result as one of two physical scenarios: a
universal jet geometry which scales linearly with black hole mass or a
dichotomy in Eddington accretion rates between flat spectrum radio quasars
(FSRQs) and BL Lacs. If we assume that the jet geometry of all blazars scales
linearly with black hole mass then we find a plausible range of masses
(10^7-10^10 solar masses). We find that the quiescent gamma-ray spectrum of
Markarian 421 is best fitted by scattering of external CMB photons. We are
unable to fit the spectrum using synchrotron self-Compton emission due to
strong gamma-ray absorption via pair production even using a compact, rapidly
decelerating, jet with a very large bulk Lorentz factor (50), as has been
suggested recently. Finally, we fit to the SEDs of the four high power HSP BL
Lacs recently found by Padovani et al. 2012. We find that their high peak
frequency emission is caused by high maximum electron energies whilst the rest
of their jet properties are typical of relatively high power BL Lacs and
consistent with our predictions.

cosmological information. It is therefore crucial to reliably predict their
observables. The Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structures (EFTofLSS)
provides a manifestly convergent perturbation theory for the weakly non-linear
regime of dark matter, where correlation functions are computed in an expansion
of the wavenumber k of a mode over the wavenumber associated with the
non-linear scale k_nl. Since most of the information is contained at high
wavenumbers, it is necessary to compute higher order corrections to correlation
functions. After the one-loop correction to the matter power spectrum, we
estimate that the next leading one is the two-loop contribution, which we
compute here. At this order in k/k_nl, there is only one counterterm in the
EFTofLSS that must be included, though this term contributes both at tree-level
and in several one-loop diagrams. We also discuss correlation functions
involving the velocity and momentum fields. We find that the EFTofLSS
prediction at two loops matches to percent accuracy the non-linear matter power
spectrum at redshift zero up to k~0.6 h/Mpc, requiring just one unknown
coefficient that needs to be fit to observations. Given that Standard
Perturbation Theory stops converging at redshift zero at k~0.1 h/Mpc, our
results demonstrate the possibility of accessing a factor of order 200 more
dark matter quasi-linear modes than naively expected. If the remaining
observational challenges to accessing these modes can be addressed with similar
success, our results show that there is tremendous potential for large scale
structure surveys to explore the primordial universe.

in the pre-reionization epoch when the intergalactic medium was heated by an
early X-ray background. Here we perform parameter studies varying the halo
masses hosting galaxies, and their X-ray production efficiencies. We also
relate these to popular models of Warm Dark Matter cosmologies. For each
parameter combination we compute the signal-to-noise (S/N) of the large-scale

Project to investigate the orbits of substructure haloes likely, according to a
semi-analytic galaxy formation model, to host luminous satellites. These tend
to populate the most massive subhaloes and are on more radial orbits than the
majority of subhaloes found within the halo virial radius. One reason for this
(mild) kinematic bias is that many low-mass subhaloes have apocentres that
exceed the virial radius of the main host; they are thus excluded from subhalo
samples identified within the virial boundary, reducing the number of subhalos
on radial orbits. Two other factors contributing to the difference in orbital
shape between dark and luminous subhaloes are their dynamical evolution after
infall, which affects more markedly low-mass (dark) subhaloes, and a weak
dependence of ellipticity on the redshift of first infall. The ellipticity
distribution of luminous satellites exhibits little halo-to-halo scatter and it
may therefore be compared fruitfully with that of Milky Way satellites. Since
the latter depends sensitively on the total mass of the Milky Way we can use
the predicted distribution of satellite ellipticities to place constraints on
this important parameter. Using the latest estimates of position and velocity
of dwarfs compiled from the literature, we find that the most likely Milky Way
mass lies in the range $6 \times 10^{11} M_{\odot} < M_{200} < 3.1 \times
10^{12} M_{\odot}$, with a best fit value of $M_{200} = 1.1 \times 10^{12}

an ansatz for the dark matter phase space distribution which allows to
construct self-consistent halo models which feature a degree of anisotropy as a
function of the radius such as suggested by the simulations. The resulting
velocity distributions are then used for an analysis of current data from dark
matter direct detection experiments. We find that velocity distributions which
are radially biased at large galactocentric distances (up to the virial radius)
lead to an increased high velocity tail of the local dark matter distribution.
This affects the interpretation of data from direct detection experiments,
especially for dark matter masses around 10 GeV, since in this region the high
velocity tail is sampled. We find that the allowed regions in the dark matter
mass-cross section plane as indicated by possible hints for a dark matter
signal reported by several experiments as well as conflicting exclusion limits

the supporting action of two hydrodynamic instabilities: neutrino-driven
convection and the Standing Accretion Shock Instability (SASI). Depending on
the structure of the stellar progenitor, each of these instabilities can
dominate the evolution of the gain region prior to the onset of explosion, with
implications for the ensuing asymmetries. Here we examine the flow dynamics in
the neighborhood of explosion by means of parametric two-dimensional,
time-dependent hydrodynamic simulations for which the linear stability
properties are well understood. We find that systems for which the convection
parameter is sub-critical (SASI-dominated) develop explosions once large-scale,
high-entropy bubbles are able to survive for several SASI oscillation cycles.
These long-lived structures are seeded by the SASI during shock expansions.
Finite-amplitude initial perturbations do not alter this outcome qualitatively,
though they can lead to significant differences in explosion times.
Supercritical systems (convection-dominated) also explode by developing
large-scale bubbles, though the formation of these structures is due to buoyant
activity. Non-exploding systems achieve a quasi-steady state in which the
time-averaged flow adjusts itself to be convectively sub-critical. We
characterize the turbulent flow using a spherical Fourier-Bessel decomposition,
identifying the relevant scalings and connecting temporal and spatial
components. Finally, we verify the applicability of these principles on the
general relativistic, radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of Mueller, Janka, &
Heger (2012), and discuss implications for the three-dimensional case.

a spectrum, at M_U = -22.7 is one of the most luminous SNe ever observed, and
gives a rare glimpse into the restframe ultraviolet where these supernovae put
out their peak energy. SNLS 07D2bv does not have a host galaxy redshift, but
based on the supernova spectrum, we estimate it to be at z ~ 1.5. Both
supernovae have similar observer-frame griz lightcurves, which map to restframe
lightcurves in the U-band and UV, rising in ~ 20 restframe days or longer, and
declining over a similar timescale. The lightcurves peak in the shortest
wavelengths first, consistent with an expanding blackbody starting near 15,000
K and steadily declining in temperature. We compare the spectra to theoretical
models, and identify lines of C II, C III, Fe III, and Mg II in the spectrum of
SNLS 06D4eu and SCP 06F6, and find that they are consistent with an expanding
explosion of only a few solar masses of carbon, oxygen, and other trace metals.
Thus the progenitors appear to be related to those suspected for SNe Ic. A high
kinetic energy, 10^52 ergs, is also favored. Normal mechanisms of powering
core- collapse or thermonuclear supernovae do not seem to work for these
supernovae. We consider models powered by 56Ni decay and interaction with

performance Phase Induced Amplitude Apodisation (PIAA) coronagraph combined
with an extreme Adaptive Optics (AO) system operating in the near-infrared (H
band). The extreme AO system driven by the 2000 element deformable mirror will
allow for Strehl ratios >90% to be achieved in the H-band when it goes closed
loop. This makes the SCExAO instrument a powerful platform for high contrast
imaging down to angular separations of the order of 1lambda/D and an ideal
testbed for exploring coronagraphic techniques for ELTs. In this paper we
report on the recent progress in regards to the development of the instrument,
which includes the addition of a visible bench that makes use of the light at
shorter wavelengths not currently utilized by SCExAO and closing the loop on
the tip/tilt wavefront sensor. We will also discuss several exciting guest
instruments which will expand the capabilities of SCExAO over the next few
years; namely CHARIS which is a integral field spectrograph as well as
VAMPIRES, a visible aperture masking experiment based on polarimetric analysis
of circumstellar disks. In addition we will elucidate the unique role extreme
AO systems will play in enabling high precision radial velocity spectroscopy
for the detection of small companions.

evolution of a planetesimal swarm orbiting the main star of a tight binary
system (TBS). The orbital evolution of each planetesimal is dictated by the
secular perturbations of the secondary star and gas drag due to interactions
with a protoplanetary disk. The gas disk is assumed eccentric with a constant
precession rate. Gravitational interactions between the planetesimals are
ignored. All bodies are assumed coplanar. A comparison with full N-body
simulations shows that the map is of the order of 100 times faster, while
preserving all the main characteristics of the full system.
  In a second part of the work, we apply MAMA to the \gamma-Cephei, searching
for friendly scenarios that may explain the formation of the giant planet
detected in this system. For low-mass protoplanetary disks, we find that a
low-eccentricity static disk aligned with the binary yields impact velocities
between planetesimals below the disruption threshold. All other scenarios
appear hostile to planetary formation.

timing and magnitude have adapted to environmental and cropping system
practices of a locality. Limitations in the habitat (filter 1) were reflected
in local C. album population recruitment season length. Generally, the duration
of seedling recruitment of both populations (local; DEN-COM) increased with
decreasing latitude, north-to-south. In general, compared to the local
population, DEN-COM recruitment at locations north of Denmark was longer and
south of Denmark was shorter, and ended sooner. Generally, the local cropping
system disturbances (CSD) period increased with decreasing latitude. The total
duration of the CSD period was over twice as long in the south as that in the
north. Recruitment at each locality possessed seasonal structure (time, number)
consisting of 2-4 discrete seasonal cohorts. This may be an adaptive means by
which C. album searches for, and exploits, recruitment opportunity just prior
to, and after, predictable disturbances. The control of C. album seedling
emergence is contained in the heteroblastic traits of its locally adapted
seeds, and is stimulated by a complex interaction of light, heat, water,
nitrate and oxygen signals inherent in the local environment. Our observations
of complex recruitment patterns occurring at critical cropping times is strong
evidence that C. album possesses a flexible and sensitive germination
regulation system adaptable to opportunity in many different Eurasian and North
American agricultural habitats.

local dynamics at the peeling front, in close analogy with the capillary-driven

a generic elastic peeling problem in the distinct limits of peeling by bending

relative to the sheet thickness, peeling is driven by bending, leading to
radial growth as $t^{7/22}$. Experimental results reproduce both the spreading
behaviour and the bending wave at the front. For large deformations relative to
the sheet thickness, stretching of the blister cap and the consequent tension
can drive peeling either by bending or by pulling at the front, both leading to
radial growth as $t^{3/8}$. In this regime, detailed predictions give excellent
agreement and explanation of previous experimental measurements of spread in
the pulling regime in an elastic Hele-Shaw cell \cite{puzovic-2012}.

for grains from supernovae (SNe). Enrichments in 32S may be due to
contributions from the Si/S zone and the result of S molecule chemistry in
still unmixed SN ejecta or due to incorporation of radioactive 32Si from C-rich
explosive He shell ejecta. However, a SN origin remains unlikely for the three
AB grains considered here, because of missing evidence for 44Ti, relatively low

ratios. Instead, we show that born-again asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars
that have undergone a very-late thermal pulse (VLTP), known to have low 12C/13C
ratios and enhanced abundances of the light s-process elements, can produce
32Si, which makes such stars attractive sources for AB grains with 32S
excesses. This lends support to the proposal that at least some AB grains
originate from born-again AGB stars, although uncertainties in the born-again
AGB star models and possible variations of initial S-isotopic compositions in

the massive colliding wind binary Eta Carinae dropped by a factor of 2-3
between 1999 and 2010. We present results from large- (r=1545au) and small-
(r=155au) domain, 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamic (SPH) simulations of Eta
Car's colliding winds for 3 Eta A mass-loss rates (2.4, 4.8, and 8.5 x 10^-4
M_sun/yr), investigating the effects on the dynamics of the binary wind-wind
collision (WWC). These simulations include orbital motion, optically thin
radiative cooling, and radiative forces. We find that Eta A's mass-loss rate
greatly affects the time-dependent hydrodynamics at all spatial scales
investigated. The simulations also show that the post-shock wind of the
companion star (Eta B) switches from the adiabatic to the radiative-cooling
regime during periastron passage. The SPH simulations together with 1D
radiative transfer models of Eta A's spectra reveal that a factor of 2 or more
drop in Eta A's mass-loss rate should lead to substantial changes in numerous
multiwavelength observables. Recent observations are not fully consistent with
the model predictions, indicating that any drop in Eta A's mass-loss rate was
likely by a factor < 2 and occurred after 2004. We speculate that most of the
recent observed changes in Eta Car are due to a small increase in the WWC
opening angle that produces significant effects because our line-of-sight to
the system lies close to the dense walls of the WWC zone. A modest decrease in
Eta A's mass-loss rate may be responsible, but changes in the wind/stellar
parameters of Eta B cannot yet be fully ruled out. We suggest observations
during Eta Car's next periastron in 2014 to further test for decreases in Eta
A's mass-loss rate. If Eta A's mass-loss rate is declining and continues to do
so, the 2014 X-ray minimum should be even shorter than that of 2009.

Sombrero galaxy using high-resolution, quasi-simultaneous, multi-frequency,
phase-referencing VLBA observations. We obtained the VLBI images toward this
nucleus, with unprecedented sensitivities and resolutions, at the seven
frequencies between 1.4 and 43 GHz, where those at 15, 24 and 43 GHz are the
first clear VLBI detections. At 43 GHz, the nuclear structure was imaged on a
linear scale under 100 Schwarzschild radii. For the first time, we have
discovered the presence of the extended structure in this nucleus, which is
directing from the radio core in two sides toward northwest/southeast
directions. The nuclear structure shows a clear spatial gradient on the radio
spectra, which is similar to that commonly seen in more luminous AGN with
powerful relativistic jets. Moreover, the radio core shows a
frequency-dependent size with an elongated shape, and the position of the core
also tends to be frequency dependent. A set of these new findings provide
evidence that the central engine of the Sombrero is powering radio jets. Based
on the observed brightness ratio of jet-to-counter jet, core position shift and
its comparison with a theoretical model, we constrained the following
fundamental physical parameters for the M 104 jets: (1) the northern side is
the approaching jet, whereas the southern side is receding: (2) the inclination
angle of the jet is relatively close to our line-of-sight, probably less than
~25degrees: (3) the jet intrinsic velocity is highly sub-relativistic at a
speed less than ~0.2c. The derived pole-on nature of the M 104 jet is in
accordance with the previous argument that M 104 contains a true type II AGN,
i.e., the broad line region of this nucleus is actually absent or intrinsically
weak, if the plane of the presumed circumnuclear torus is perpendicular to the
axis of the radio jets.

We perform a series of simulations for binary mass ratios in the range 0.026 <
q < 1.0, each lasting longer than a viscous time so that we reach a
quasi-steady accretion state. In each case, we find that gas is efficiently
stripped from the inner edge of the circumbinary disk and enters the cavity
along accretion streams, which feed persistent ""mini-disks"" surrounding each
black hole. We find that for q > 0.1, the binary excites eccentricity in the
inner region of the circumbinary disk, creating an overdense lump which gives
rise to enhanced periodicity in the accretion rate. The dependence of the
periodicity on mass ratio may provide a method for observationally inferring
mass ratios from measurements of the accretion rate. We also find that for all
mass ratios studied, the magnitude of the accretion onto the secondary is
sufficient to drive the binary toward larger mass ratio. This suggests a
mechanism for biasing mass ratio distributions toward equal mass.

generated subgroups of the Gupta--Sidki 3-group $G$ are abstractly
commensurable with $G$ or $G\times G$. As a consequence, we show that $G$ is
subgroup separable and from this it follows that its membership problem is

fluctuations in a ternary mixture in the presence of a diffusion barrier, the
triggering of a Rayleigh-Taylor instability by diffusion in a four-species

finite time from smooth initial data is one of the most challenging problems in
mathematical fluid dynamics. This work attempts to provide an affirmative
answer to this long-standing open question from a numerical point of view, by
presenting a class of potentially singular solutions to the Euler equations
computed in axisymmetric geometries. The solutions satisfy a periodic boundary
condition along the axial direction and no-flow boundary condition on the solid
wall. The equations are discretized in space using a hybrid 6th-order Galerkin
and 6th-order finite difference method, on specially designed adaptive (moving)
meshes that are dynamically adjusted to the evolving solutions. With a maximum
effective resolution of over $(3 \times 10^{12})^{2}$ near the point of the
singularity, we are able to advance the solution up to $\tau_{2} = 0.003505$
and predict a singularity time of $t_{s} \approx 0.0035056$, while achieving a
\emph{pointwise} relative error of $O(10^{-4})$ in the vorticity vector
$\omega$ and observing a $(3 \times 10^{8})$-fold increase in the maximum
vorticity $\|\omega\|_{\infty}$. The numerical data are checked against all
major blowup (non-blowup) criteria, including Beale-Kato-Majda,
Constantin-Fefferman-Majda, and Deng-Hou-Yu, to confirm the validity of the
singularity. A local analysis near the point of the singularity also suggests
the existence of a self-similar blowup in the meridian plane.

evolutionary dynamics of symmetric $N$-player matrix games with two pure
strategies. In such games, gains from switching strategies depend, in general,
on how many other individuals in the group play a given strategy. As a
consequence, the gain function determining the gradient of selection can be a
polynomial of degree $N-1$. In order to deal with the intricacy of the
resulting evolutionary dynamics, we make use of the theory of polynomials in
Bernstein form. This theory implies a tight link between the sign pattern of
the gains from switching on the one hand and the number and stability
properties of the rest points of the replicator dynamics on the other hand.
While this relationship is a general one, it is most informative if gains from
switching have at most two sign changes, as it is the case for most
multi-player matrix games considered in the literature. We demonstrate that
previous results for public goods games are easily recovered and extended using
this observation. Further examples illustrate how focusing on the sign pattern
of the gains from switching obviates the need for a more involved analysis.

will appear to shrink in angular size as the universe expands. Observations of
extragalactic proper motions can thus directly reveal the cosmic expansion.
Relatively static structures such as galaxies or galaxy clusters can
potentially be used to measure the Hubble constant, and test masses in large
scale structures can measure the overdensity. Since recession velocities and
angular separations can be precisely measured, apparent proper motions can also
provide geometric distance measurements to static structures. The apparent
fractional angular compression of static objects is 15 microarcseconds per year
in the local universe; this motion is modulated by the overdensity in dynamic
expansion-decoupled structures.
  We use the Titov et al. quasar proper motion catalog to examine the pairwise
proper motion of a sparse network of test masses. Small-separation pairs (< 200
Mpc comoving) are too few to measure the expected effect, yielding an
inconclusive 8.3 +/- 14.9 microarcsec/yr. Large-separation pairs (200-1500 Mpc)
show no net convergence or divergence for z < 1, -2.7 +/- 3.7 microarcsec/yr,
consistent with pure Hubble expansion and significantly inconsistent with
static structures, as expected. For all pairs a ""null test"" gives -0.36 +/-
0.62 microarcsec/yr, consistent with Hubble expansion, and excludes a static
locus at ~5-10 sigma significance for z ~ 0.5-2.0. The observed
large-separation pairs provide a reference frame for small-separation pairs
that will significantly deviate from the Hubble flow. The current limitation is
the number of small-separation objects with precise astrometry, but Gaia will
address this and will likely detect the cosmic recession.

Automata (PCPA) were introduced and shown to be able to simulate
nondeterministic one-way multi-head pushdown automata in returning mode, even
if communication is restricted to be one-way having a single target component.
A simulation of such centralized PCPA by one-way multi-head pushdown automata
(Balan 2009) turned out to be incomplete (Otto 2012). Subsequently it was shown
that centralized returning PCPA are universal even if the number of components
is two (Petersen 2013) and thus are separated from one-way multi-head pushdown
automata. Another line of research modified the definition of PCPA such that
communication is asynchronous (Otto 2013). While the simulation of one-way
multi-head pushdown automata is still possible, now a converse construction
shows this model in returning mode to be equivalent to the one-way multi-head
pushdown automaton in a very precise sense. It was left open, whether
non-centralized returning PCPA of degree two are universal. In the first part
of the paper we show this to be the case. Then we turn our attention to Uniform
Distributed Pushdown Automata Systems (UDPAS). These systems of automata work
in turn on a single tape. We show that UPDAS accepting with empty stack do not

popularity for information exchange. The availability of unprecedented amounts

social networks remains elusive due to the complexity of social interactions
and rapid change of online social networks. Much of prior work on information
diffusion over online social networks has based on empirical and statistical
approaches. The majority of dynamical models arising from information diffusion
over online social networks involve ordinary differential equations which only
depend on time. In a number of recent papers, the authors propose to use
partial differential equations(PDEs) to characterize temporal and spatial
patterns of information diffusion over online social networks. Built on
intuitive cyber-distances such as friendship hops in online social networks,
the reaction-diffusion equations take into account influences from various
external out-of-network sources, such as the mainstream media, and provide a
new analytic framework to study the interplay of structural and topical
influences on information diffusion over online social networks. In this
survey, we discuss a number of PDE-based models that are validated with real
datasets collected from popular online social networks such as Digg and
Twitter. Some new developments including the conservation law of information
flow in online social networks and information propagation speeds based on
traveling wave solutions are presented to solidify the foundation of the PDE
models and highlight the new opportunities and challenges for mathematicians as

application to acceleration of electrons in solar flares based on stochastic
acceleration by turbulence. Here we explore its application for determining the
characteristics of shock acceleration in supernova remnants (SNRs) based on the
electron spectra deduced from the observed nonthermal radiation from SNRs and
the spectrum of the cosmic ray electrons observed near the Earth. These spectra
are related by the process of escape of the electrons from SNRs and energy loss
during their transport in the galaxy. Thus, these observations allow us to
determine spectral characteristics of the momentum and pitch angle diffusion
coefficients, which play crucial roles in both direct acceleration by
turbulence and in high Mach number shocks. Assuming that the average electron
spectrum deduced from a few well known SNRs is representative of those in the
solar neighborhood we find interesting discrepancies between our deduced forms
for these coefficients and those expected from well known wave-particle
interactions. This may indicate that the standard assumptions made in treatment
of shock acceleration need revision. In particular, the escape of particles
from SNRs may be more complex than generally assumed.

basic principles of classical field theory, we show that for the correct
understanding of the problem, one needs to carefully distinguish situations
when the material medium is modeled either as a background on which light
propagates or as a dynamical part of the total system. In the former case, we
prove that the (generalized) Belinfante-Rosenfeld (BR) tensor for the
electromagnetic field coincides with the Minkowski tensor. We derive a complete
set of balance equations for this open system and show that the symmetries of
the background medium are directly related to the conservation of the Minkowski
quantities. In particular, for isotropic media, the angular momentum of light
is conserved despite of the fact that the Minkowski tensor is non-symmetric.
For the closed system of light interacting with matter, we model the material
medium as a relativistic non-dissipative fluid and we prove that it is always
possible to express the total BR tensor of the closed system either in the
Abraham or in the Minkowski separation. However, in the case of dynamical
media, the balance equations have a particularly convenient form in terms of
the Abraham tensor. Our results generalize previous attempts and provide a
first principles basis for a unified understanding of the long-standing
Abraham-Minkowski controversy without ad hoc arguments.

of actions, and (2) an increase and then decrease in the diversity of actions.
Diversity of actions is positively correlated with number of needs, population
size and density, and with the erosion of borders between populations. Slowly
eroding borders maximize diversity, fostering specialization followed by
sharing of fit actions. Square (as opposed to toroidal) worlds also exhibit
higher diversity. Introducing a leader that broadcasts its actions throughout
the population increases the fitness of actions but reduces diversity; these
effects diminish the more leaders there are. Low density populations have less

of a trilogy concerning the solar wind complexity. Solar wind plasma is a
typical case of stochastic spatiotemporal distribution of physical magnitudes
such as force fields (B, E) and matter fields (particle and current densities
or bulk plasma distributions). The results of this study can be understood in
the framework of modern theoretical concepts such as non-extensive statistical
mechanics (Tsallis, 2009), fractal topology (Zelenyi and Milovanov, 2004),
turbulence theory (Frisch,1996), strange dynamics (Zaslavsky, 2002),

transport theory (Milovanov, 2001), fractional dynamics (Tarasov, 2007) and
non-equilibrium phase transition theory (Chang, 1992). This study shows clearly
the non-extensive and non-Gaussian character of the solar wind plasma and the
existence of multi-scale strong correlations from the microscopic to the
macroscopic level. This result indicates the inefficiency of classical MHD or
plasma statistical theories based on the classical central limit theorem to
explain the complexity of the solar wind dynamics, since these theories include
smooth and differentiable spatial-temporal functions (MHD theory) or Gaussian
statistics (Boltzmann-Maxwell statistical mechanics). However, the results of
this study indicate the presence of non-Gaussian non-extensive statistics with
heavy tails probability distribution functions, which are related to the

computation and analog quantum simulation, require the ability to subject a
system to precisely specified Hamiltonians. Unfortunately, the hardware used to
implement these Hamiltonians will be imperfect and limited in its precision.
Even small perturbations and imprecisions can have profound effects on the
nature of the ground state. Here we consider an imperfect implementation of
adiabatic quantum optimization and show that, for a widely applicable random
control noise model, quantum stabilizer encodings are able to reduce the
effective noise magnitude and thus improve the likelihood of a successful
computation or simulation. This reduction builds upon two design principles:
summation of equivalent logical operators to increase the energy scale of the
encoded optimization problem, and the inclusion of a penalty term comprising
the sum of the code stabilizer elements. We illustrate our findings with an
Ising ladder and show that classical repetition coding drastically increases
the probability that the ground state of a perturbed model is decodable to that
of the unperturbed model, while using only realistic two-body interaction.
Finally, we note that the repetition encoding is a special case of quantum
stabilizer encodings, and show that this in principle allows us to generalize
our results to many types of analog quantum information processing, albeit at
the expense of many-body interactions.

factorizations. Despite their pronounced differences, it has been shown that
the group lifting structures for both the WS and HS classes satisfy a polyphase
order-increasing property that implies uniqueness (""modulo rescaling"") of
irreducible group lifting factorizations in both group lifting structures.
These unique factorization results can in turn be used to characterize the

changes that can plausibly be associated with thermal pulses on the asymptotic
red giant branch. Individual RR Lyrae stars show period changes that do not
accord with the predictions of stellar evolution theory. This may be especially
true for RR Lyrae stars that exhibit the Blazhko effect. However, the average
period changes of all of the RR Lyrae variables within a globular cluster prove
a better but still imperfect match for the predictions of evolutionary theory.

hydrogen-burning dwarf stars orbiting each other so closely that they share a
common envelope. Although they are relatively common, there is as yet no
established consensus on the principle evolutionary questions surrounding them:
how do they form, how do they evolve over time, what do they become?
  One observational clue to their evolutionary history has been the abrupt
termination of the orbital period distribution around 5.2 hours. We have
undertaken an observational study of this by 1) discovery of fast W UMa systems
in our Calvin-Rehoboth Observatory data archive, 2) follow-up with the
Calvin-Rehoboth Observatory of candidate fast systems from the Catalina Sky
Survey, and 3) follow-up of other reports of potentially fast systems in other
recently published surveys. We find the follow-up to have been particularly
important as many surveys taken for other purposes lead to ambiguous or
incorrect claims for periods less than five hours.
  Our results to date may be characterized as showing two distinct components:
the steeply decaying tail associated with the previously known cutoff along
with a low-amplitude, but apparently uniform distribution that extends down to
3.6 hours. The confirmation at greater sensitivity of the abruptness of the
cutoff seems to imply that the dominant mechanism for system formation (or the
mechanism that determines system lifetime) does have a strong period
dependence. At the same time, there appears to be a second mechanism at work as
well which leads to the formation of the ultrafast component of the histogram.

LivingSocial have provided a new channel for merchants to directly market to
consumers. In order to maximize consumer acquisition and retention, these
platforms would like to offer deals that give good value to users. Currently,
selecting such deals is done manually; however, the large number of submarkets
and localities necessitates an automatic approach to selecting good deals and
determining merchant payments.
  We approach this challenge as a market design problem. We postulate that
merchants already have a good idea of the attractiveness of their deal to
consumers as well as the amount they are willing to pay to offer their deal.
The goal is to design an auction that maximizes a combination of the revenue of
the auctioneer (platform), welfare of the bidders (merchants), and the positive
externality on a third party (the consumer), despite the asymmetry of
information about this consumer benefit. We design auctions that truthfully
elicit this information from the merchants and maximize the social welfare
objective, and we characterize the consumer welfare functions for which this
objective is truthfully implementable. We generalize this characterization to a
very broad mechanism-design setting and give examples of other applications.

Thus, RRc can be useful indicators of line of sight reddening toward old

Below, in the watershed, there remain small nuggets to be found flowing from
the deepest recesses of the mine. The SDSS-DR9 included the release of the
flux- and wavelength-calibrated, individual spectra which were subsequently
combined to form the composite spectra found in previous SDSS data releases.
These single-epoch spectra (SES) can be analyzed to find flux and spectral line
variability, and to probe aspects of phase variations for objects such as RRL
stars. For $\sim 45%$ of the spectra in the RRL color range, SES were taken on
separate nights, sometimes weeks apart. The remaining dataset have a time
baseline of 0.75 to 1.5 hours and consist of 4-7 separate exposures. In my talk
I will present details of our project to detect variability and to constrain
the pulsation phase at the time of observation. I will discuss our
auto-detection technique that uses division of all SES for a given star to
search for variations in the flux, the hydrogen Balmer lines and the CaII K
line. This procedure is being tested against known variables and non-variable
stars within Stripe 82 to determine the identification effectiveness as a
function of signal-to-noise, RRL type, and time baseline length. I will also
discuss the use of empirical standard star templates to predict pulsation phase
from the combination of hydrogen line strengths and radial velocity variations.
Our ultimate goal is to combine the SES analysis with our new metallicity
calibration in order to increase the number of RRL stars that have reliable
metallicity determinations and which can then be used to probe the structure of

the magnetic field may decay downstream with distance from the shock front.
Here we show that the synchrotron spectrum becomes harder if electrons undergo
synchrotron and inverse-Compton cooling in a decaying MF. To reconcile this
with the typical GRB spectrum with low energy slope $\nu F_\nu\propto\nu$, it
is required that the postshock MF decay time is comparable to the cooling time
of the bulk electrons (corresponding to a MF decaying length typically of
$\sim10^5$ skin depths); that the inverse-Compton cooling should dominate
synchrotron cooling after the MF decay time; and/or that the MF decays with

presents a formidable challenge to efforts to describe biological phenomena
using a classical (Kolmogorovian) mathematical framework. We develop a quantum
framework for exaptation with examples from both biological and cultural
evolution. The state of a trait is written as a linear superposition of a set
of basis states, or possible forms the trait could evolve into, in a complex
Hilbert space. These basis states are represented by mutually orthogonal unit
vectors, each weighted by an amplitude term. The choice of possible forms
(basis states) depends on the adaptive function of interest (e.g., ability to
metabolize lactose or thermoregulate), which plays the role of the observable.
Observables are represented by self-adjoint operators on the Hilbert space. The
possible forms (basis states) corresponding to this adaptive function
(observable) are called eigenstates. The framework incorporates key features of
exaptation: potentiality, contextuality, nonseparability, and emergence of new
features. However, since it requires that one enumerate all possible contexts,
its predictive value is limited, consistent with the assertion that there
exists no biological equivalent to ""laws of motion"" by which we can predict the

the empirical spectral energy distributions of QSOs and \dot{M}_{\bullet,acc}
by fitting the observed optical luminosity(/-ies) with the thin accretion disk
model, assuming the MBH masses given by the virial mass estimator(s)
(M_{\bullet,vir}). We find an apparent correlation between epsilon and
M_{\bullet,vir}, which is strong at redshift z \la 1.8, weak at z \ga 2, and
consistent with that found by Davis & Laor (2011) for 80 PG QSOs at z \leq 0.5.
To investigate whether this correlation is intrinsic or not, we construct a
mock sample of QSOs according to the true MBH mass and Eddington ratio
distributions given in Kelly & Shen (2013). By comparing the results obtained
from the mock sample with that from the SDSS sample, we demonstrate that the
apparent epsilon-M_{\bullet,vir} correlation can be produced by and mainly due
to the selection effects of the SDSS sample and the bias induced by the usage
of M_{\bullet,vir} as the true MBH mass. The mean values of epsilon of those
SDSS QSOs are consistent with being a constant \simeq 0.11-0.16 over the
redshift range of 0.3 \la z \la 4. We conclude that the current SDSS QSO data
is consistent with no strong intrinsic correlation between radiative efficiency
and true MBH mass and no significant redshift evolution of radiative
efficiencies.

Lambek grammars, possibly with product, are learnable from proof frames that

  After a short reminder on grammatical inference \`a la Gold, we provide an
algorithm that learns Lambek grammars with product from proof frames and we
prove its convergence. We do so for 1-valued also known as rigid Lambek
grammars with product, since standard techniques can extend our result to
$k$-valued grammars. Because of the correspondence between cut-free proof nets

tens of meters. It had approached closely the Earth on 15 February, 2013 UT,
providing an opportunity for precise measurements of this tiny asteroid. Aims.
The solar phase angle of 2012 DA14 had varied widely around its closest
approach but was almost constant during the following night. We performed
time-series photometric observations on those two nights to determine the
rotational properties and phase effect. Methods. The observations were carried
out using the 0.55-m telescope at Saitama University, Japan. The R-band images
were obtained continuously over a 2 hr period at the closest approach and for
about 5 hr on the next night. Results. The lightcurve data from the second
night indicates a rotational period of 11.0 +1.8/-0.6 hr and a peak-to-peak
amplitude of 1.59 +/- 0.02 mag. The brightness variation before and after the
closest approach was separated into two components that are derived from the
rotation and phase effect. We found that the phase curve slope of this asteroid
is significantly shallower than those of other L-type asteroids. Conclusions.
We suggest that 2012 DA14 is coated with a coarse surface that lacks fine
regolith particles and/or a high albedo surface.

aerodynamic lift produced by a wing tethered to the ground and controlled to

the generator, in presence of limited information on wind speed and direction,
is considered. At constant tether speed operation, the power is related to the
traction force generated by the wing. First, a study of the traction force is
presented for a general path parametrization. In particular, the sensitivity of
the traction force on the path parameters is analyzed. Then, the results of
this analysis are exploited to design an algorithm to maximize the force, hence
the power, in real-time. The algorithm uses only the measured traction force on
the tether and it is able to adapt the system's operation to maximize the
average force with uncertain and time-varying wind. The influence of inaccurate
sensor readings and turbulent wind are also discussed. The presented algorithm
is not dependent on a specific hardware setup and can act as an extension of
existing control structures. Both numerical simulations and experimental
results are presented to highlight the effectiveness of the approach.

'modifiers', and a 2-tier system for 'up-to-effects' and 'strong' equations.
Each pattern provides generic rules for dealing with any monad (respectively
comonad), and it can be extended with specific rules for each effect. The paper
presents two use cases: a language with exceptions (using the standard monadic

is a hot research direction. The basic idea is that the destination,
simultaneously with the source, sends a jamming signal to interfere the
eavesdropper near to or co-located with the relay. Similar as physical layer
network coding, the friendly jamming signal will prevent the eavesdropper from
detecting the useful information originated from the source and will not affect
the destination on detecting the source information with the presence of the
known jamming signal. However, existing investigations are confined to Gaussian
distributed signals, which are seldom used in real systems. When finite
constellation signals are applied, the behavior of the secrecy rate becomes
very different. For example, the secrecy rate depends on phase difference
between the input signals with finite constellations, which is not observed
with Gaussian signals. In this paper, we investigate the secrecy capacity and
derive its upper bound for the two-hop relay model, by assuming an eavesdropper
near the relay and the widely used M-PSK modulation. With our upper bound, the
best and worst phase differences in high SNR region are then given. Numerical

Thermodynamic forces are applied to each transport channel that generate
fluctuating stationary currents. The full counting statistics of the currents
is obtained starting from a microscopic Hamiltonian describing the electron
dynamics. We verify that the joined probability distribution of the currents in
each channel satisfies a fluctuation theorem in the long-time limit. The issue
of single-current fluctuation theorems for the marginal distribution of the
currents in one of the two channels is also investigated. We show that in the
limit of large current ratio between both channels, a single-current
fluctuation theorem is satisfied individually for the slower circuit in
agreement with experimental observations. This theorem involves an effective
affinity which depends on the thermodynamic forces applied to both channels and
the specific features of the system considered. A detailed study of the
effective affinity is made for the two aforementioned systems. Besides, we
introduce a criteria on the initial condition of the transport channels for the

(i) they prevent the existence of the negative differential conductance
observed for non-interacting quantum dot over the whole range of voltages, (ii)
affect the distribution of the currents as function of the applied voltage and
(iii) lead to the appearance of additional low bias feature due to the
formation of the Abrikosov-Suhl resonance. The non-local correlations in the
Coulomb blockade regime are most pronounced for the particle-hole symmetric dot
and thus can be easily tuned by means of gate voltage. They are observed even
in the Kondo regime and dominate the behavior close to the Abrikosov-Suhl
resonance showing convincingly that Kondo correlations do not destroy subtle
entanglement between electrons.

increasingly employed to synthesise multiple, imperfect and disparate sources
of evidence, to estimate quantities that are difficult to measure directly. The
various data sources are dependent on shared parameters and hence have the
potential to conflict with each other, as well as with the model. In a Bayesian
framework, the model consists of three components: the prior distribution, the
assumed form of the likelihood and structural assumptions. Any of these
components may be incompatible with the observed data. The detection and
quantification of such conflict and of data sources that are inconsistent with
each other is therefore a crucial component of the model criticism process. We
first review Bayesian model criticism, with a focus on conflict detection,
before describing a general diagnostic for detecting and quantifying conflict
between the evidence in different partitions of a DAG. The diagnostic is a
p-value based on splitting the information contributing to inference about a
""separator"" node or group of nodes into two independent groups and testing
whether the two groups result in the same inference about the separator
node(s). We illustrate the method with three comprehensive examples: an
evidence synthesis to estimate HIV prevalence; an evidence synthesis to
estimate influenza case-severity; and a hierarchical growth model for rat

connected in parallel was achieved one year later leading to the first ever
superconducting quantum interferometer. The latter, together with Rowell's
observations, constituted the unequivocal demonstration of the Josephson
supercurrent-phase relation. Yet, the Josephson effect has further profound
implications going beyond electrical transport, as the interplay between the
Cooper condensate and unpaired electrons provides thermal flow through the
junction with phase coherence as well. Here we report the first demonstration
of quantum diffraction of a heat flux showing that a temperature-biased single
Josephson junction is exploited as a diffractor for thermal currents.
Specifically, thermal diffraction manifests itself with a peculiar modulation
of the electron temperature in a small metallic electrode nearby-contacted to
the junction when sweeping the magnetic flux $\Phi$. Remarkably, the observed
temperature dependence exhibits $\Phi$-symmetry and a clear reminiscence with a
Fraunhofer-like modulation pattern, as expected fingerprints for a quantum
diffraction phenomenon. Our results confirm a pristine prediction of quantum
heat transport and, joined with double-junction heat interferometry
demonstrated in Nature 492, 401 (2012), exemplify the complementary and
conclusive proof of the existence of phase-dependent thermal currents in

two phases, short- and long-term recoveries. The problem of short-term recovery
is rather close to the problem of resilience in their goal, namely, bouncing
the damaged system back to the operating standards. The present paper proposes
an algorithm for the vital resource redistribution required for implementation
of the short-term recovery. The developed model is based on the cooperative
interaction of cities during the resource redistribution, ordering the cities
according to their priority in resource delivery, and a generating a
semi-optimal plan for the desired redistribution. Nonlinear effects caused by
the city limit capacities are taken into account. Two types of systems,
""uniform"" and ""centralized"", are studied numerically. In particular it is
demonstrated that the cooperation effects are able to shorten substantially the
duration of the process required for its implementation.

solution $u(x,y)$ at the tip $0$ of such admissible multiple cracks, being a
singularity point, are described, on the basis of blow-up scaling techniques
and spectral theory of pencils of non self-adjoint operators. Typical types of
admissible cracks are shown to be governed by nodal sets of a countable family
of harmonic polynomials, which are now represented as pencil eigenfunctions,
instead of their classical representation via a standard Sturm--Liouville
problem. Eventually, for a fixed admissible crack formation at the origin, this
allows us to describe all boundary data, which can generate such a blow-up

certain measures of importance of parameters in influencing the outputs of
mathematical models. Sensitivity indices computed in variance-based sensitivity
analysis yield quantitative answers to questions like how much on average the
variance of model output, measuring its uncertainty, decreases, if exact values
of certain unknown parameters are determined, e. g. in an experiment. We
propose new schemes for estimation of variance-based sensitivity indices of
outputs of stochastic models, their conditional expectations, and histograms
given the parameters. Unbiased estimators obtained in these schemes can be used
in a Monte Carlo (MC) procedure approximating sensitivity indices. We derive
relations between variances of final estimators of MC procedures making the
same number of evaluations of given function, but using different schemes, both
for the newly introduced schemes and for some used before in the literature.
Numerical experiment for a discrete state stochastic Markov model of a chemical
reaction network (DM) shows that our method can lead to much lower error than
method analogous to the one offered by Degasperi et al. Further numerical
experiments demonstrate that the application of random time change (RTC)
algorithm due to Rathinam et al. for simulation of DM can lead to over 30 times
lower variance of estimators of certain sensitivity indices than when
Gillespie's direct (GD) method is used, and that this variance may
significantly depend on the order of reactions in GD method. We provide some
intuitions explaining these effects. We generalize measures used for comparing
dispersion of different distributions, such as coefficient of variation and
Fano factor to the random parameters case, in a way that they can be computed
along with variance-based sensitivity indices.

  Survivability Study and Pattern Printing",,,,,"physics.bio-ph cond-mat.soft q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A novel piezoelectric, drop-on-demand (DOD) inkjet system has been developed
and used to print L929 rat fibroblast cells. We investigate the survivability
of the cells subjected to the large stresses during the printing process. These
stresses are varied by changing the diameter of the orifice (36 to 119 microns)
through which the cells are dispensed, as well as changing the electrical pulse
used to drive the piezoelectric element. It is shown that for the smallest 36
microns diameter orifice, cell survival rates fall from 95% to approximately
76% when the ejection velocity is increased from 2 to 16 m/s. This decrease in
survival rates is less significant when the larger orifice diameters of 81
microns and 119 microns are used. Analysis shows that there is a clear inverse
relationship between cell survival rates and the mean shear rates during drop
formation. By using the same printing set-up, fibroblast cells are printed onto
alginate and collagen into patterns. Printed cells are cultured over a period
of days to verify their long-term viability. Fibroblasts printed onto the
collagen are found to successfully adhere, spread and proliferate, subsequently
forming a denser patterns after 5 days in culture. Cell agglomeration is found
to affect the printing performance, especially for the printhead with the
smallest orifice, leading to frequent clogging of the nozzle. We also study the
number of cells in each droplet, when printed under optimal conditions. The
probability density of this number follows a binomial distribution, which
consistent with a uniform distribution of cells in the medium and within the
printhead.

formulated as a linear regression problem whose regression coefficients

the linear mixing model. The positivity constraint is ensured by the Karush
Kuhn Tucker conditions whereas the sum-to-one constraint is fulfilled by
introducing normalized variables in the algorithm. The convergence is ensured
by a one-dimensional search of the step size. Note that NSGM can be applied to
any convex cost function with non negativity and flux constraints. In order to
compare the NSGM with the well-known fully constraint least squares (FCLS)
algorithm, this latter is reformulated in term of a penalized function, which
reveals its suboptimality. Simulations on synthetic data illustrate the

into account in any fit to data. This can influence the shape and strength of

producing enough ionizing photons to reionize the IGM, and suggest that
Population III stars could resolve this tension, because their harder spectra
can produce ~10x more ionizing photons than Population II. But this argument
depends critically on the duration of the Population III era, and because
Population III stars form from pristine gas, in turn depends on the rate of
galactic enrichment. We use a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation which
tracks galactic chemical evolution, to gauge the impact of Population III stars
on reionization. Population III SNe produce distinct metal abundances, and we
argue that the duration of the Population III era can be constrained by precise
relative abundance measurements in high-z damped Ly{\alpha} absorbers (DLAs),
which provide a chemical record of past star-formation. We find that a single
generation of Population III stars can self-enrich galaxies above the critical
metallicity Zcrit=10^-4 Zsun for the Population III-to-II transition, on a very
short timescale of ~10^6 yr, owing to the large metal yields and short
lifetimes of Population III stars. This subsequently terminates the Population
III era, hence they contribute >~ 50% of the ionizing photons only for z >~ 30,
and at z=10 contribute <1%. The Population III contribution can be increased by
delaying metal mixing into the ISM. However comparing the resulting metal
abundance pattern to existing measurements in z <~ 6 DLAs, we show that the
fractional contribution of high-mass Population III stars to the ionization
rate must be <~ 10% at z = 10. Future abundance measurements of z~7-8 QSOs and

  effect",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Charge fractionalization is a possible emergent excitation in a
low-dimensional system of interacting electrons. A known example is that of
fractional charges in the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) regime, which
is a consequence of strong Coulomb interaction among the electrons whose
kinetic energy is quenched by the strong magnetic field. Alternatively, the
integer QHE (IQHE), with electrons behaving largely as independent particles in
Landau levels (LLs), lacks such fractionalization. However, for integer LLs
filling v=2, 3,... electrons propagate in copropagating adjacent chiral edge
channels, and thus interact and modify the non-interacting LLs. For example, at
v=2, an electron injected selectively into a single non-interacting (bare) edge
channel is expected to decompose into a 'fast' mode and a 'slow' mode in the
region of interaction; each mode carry fractional charges shared between the
two bare channels. Here, we report our sensitive shot noise measurement that
affirms the presence of such fractionalization in v=2. Injecting partitioned
current into a 'hot' edge channel led to low frequency shot noise in the
adjacent currentless 'cold' edge channel after it had been partitioned.
Controlling the partitioning of the hot and cold channels allowed a
determination of the fractional charges in both channels as well as the
channels' velocity difference. This approach can be easily extended to study
interaction in two-dimensional systems with a topology dictating edge channels
transport.

scale helical magnetic fields are resilient to turbulent diffusion in the sense
that helical fields stronger than a critical value, decay on slow (~resistively
mediated), rather than fast ($\sim$ turbulent) time scales. This gives more
credence to potential fossil field origin models of the magnetic fields in
stars, galaxies and compact objects. We analyze a suite of direct numerical
simulations (DNS) of decaying large scale helical magnetic fields in the
presence of non-helical turbulence to further study the physics of helical
field decay. We study two separate cases: (1) the initial field is large enough
to decay resistively, is tracked until it transitions to decay fast, and the
critical large scale helical field at that transition is sought; (2) the case
of Paper I, wherein there is a critical initial helical field strength below
which the field undergoes fast decay right from the beginning. In case (1),
both DNS and solutions of the two scale model (from Paper 1), reveal that the
transition energy, $E_{c1}$, is independent of the scale of the turbulent
forcing, within a small range of $\Rm$. We also find that the kinetic alpha,
$\alpha_K$, is subdominant to magnetic alpha, $\alpha_M$, in the DNS,
justifying an assumption in the two scale model. For case (2), we show exact
solutions of two scale model in the limit of $\eta \rightarrow 0$ in fully
helical case, leading to the transition energy, $E_{c2} = (k_1/\kf)^2 M_{eq}$,
where $k_1$ and $\kf$ are the large scale and small turbulent forcing scale
respectively and $M_{eq}$ is the equipartition magnetic energy. The DNS in this
case agree qualitatively with the two scale model but the $R_M$ currently
achievable, is too small to satisfy a condition $3/R_M << (k_1/k_f)^2$,
necessary to robustly reveal the transition, $E_{c2}$ (Abridged).

observe up to 1,000,000 stars and detect and characterize hundreds of small
planets, and thousands of planets in the Neptune to gas giant regime out to the
HZ. It will therefore provide the first large-scale catalogue of bulk

  In this paper we describe a new model of gravitational inflation that is
driven by dark energy and ""mediated"" by a real massless scalar inflaton field
$\varphi$ whose potential is identically equal to zero. The coupled Einstein
gravitational and inflaton field equations are formulated on an
eight-dimensional spacetime manifold of \textbf{four space} dimensions and

equations that exhibit temporal exponential \textbf{deflation of three of the

field $\psi$ that propagates on the background ground state Einstein
gravitational field to determine whether its quantum fluctuations $\delta \psi$
are stable or unstable. We compute explicit approximate solutions to the
$\delta \psi$ field equations that are \textbf{stable}, meaning that the
quantum fluctuations $\delta \psi$ of the field $\psi$ do not grow
exponentially with time. \textbf{Instabilities} driven by the momenta

scattering rate. The optical scattering rate of correlated charge carriers can
be defined within an extended Drude model formalism. When some electron and
hole doped copper oxide systems are in the spin density or charge density wave
phases they show hump structures in their optical scattering rates. The hump
structures have not yet been simulated and understood clearly. We are able to
simulate the hump structure by using a peak followed by a dip feature in the
normalized density of states within a generalized Allen formalism. We observe
that reversing the order of the dip and peak gives completely different
features in the optical scattering rate; a peak-dip (dip peak) results in a
hump (a valley) in the scattering rate. We also obtain the real part of the
optical conductivity and reflectance spectra from the simulated optical
scattering rate and compare them with published experimental spectra. From
these comparisons we conclude that the peak-dip order can give the hump
structure, which is observed experimentally in copper oxide systems. Finally we
fit two published optical spectra with our new model and discuss our results
and the possible origin of the dip or peak features in the normalized density
of states.

flows with speeds given by concave (convex), degree one homogeneous functions

were subsequently extended to hypersurface flows in the sphere and hyperbolic

  In the first part of the paper, we show that locally convex solutions are
exterior non-collapsing for a larger class of speed functions than previously
considered; more precisely, we show that the previous results hold when
convexity of the speed function is relaxed to inverse-concavity. We note that
inverse-concavity is satisfied by a large class of concave speed functions. As
a consequence, we obtain a large class of two-sided non-collapsing flows,
whereas previously two-sided non-collapsing was only known for the mean
curvature flow.
  In the second part of the paper, we demonstrate the utility of two sided
non-collapsing with a straightforward proof of convergence of compact, convex
hypersurfaces to round points.
  The proof of the non-collapsing estimate is similar to the previous results
mentioned, in that we show that the exterior ball curvature is a viscosity
supersolution of the linearised flow. The new ingredient is the following
observation: Since the function which provides an upper support in the
derivation of the viscosity inequality is defined on $M\times M$ (or $TM$ in
the `boundary case'), whereas the exterior ball curvature and the linearised
flow equation depend only on the first factor, we are privileged with a freedom
of choice in which second derivatives from the extra directions to include in
the calculation. The optimal choice is closely related to the class of
inverse-concave speed functions.

  This paper presents the first attempt to blindly learn fundamental spectral
components of MIR galaxy spectra, using non-negative matrix factorisation
(NMF). NMF is a recently developed multivariate technique shown to be
successful in blind source separation problems. Unlike the more popular
multivariate analysis technique, principal component analysis, NMF imposes the
condition that weights and spectral components are non-negative. This more
closely resembles the physical process of emission in the mid-infrared,
resulting in physically intuitive components. By applying NMF to galaxy spectra
in the Cornell Atlas of Spitzer/IRS sources (CASSIS), we find similar
components amongst different NMF sets. These similar components include two for
AGN emission and one for star formation. [... ABBREVIATED...] We show an NMF
set with seven components can reconstruct the general spectral shape of a wide
variety of objects, though struggle to fit the varying strength of emission
lines. We also show that the seven components can be used to separate out
different types of objects. We model this separation with Gaussian Mixtures
modelling and use the result to provide a classification tool.
  We also show the NMF components can be used to separate out the emission from
AGN and star formation regions and define a new star formation/AGN diagnostic
which is consistent with all mid-infrared diagnostics already in use but has
the advantage that it can be applied to mid-infrared spectra with low signal to
noise or with limited spectral range. The 7 NMF components and code for
classification are made public on arxiv and are available at:

structural evolution of polymers during mechanical deformation, but relatively
few studies focus on the influence of boundary conditions on this evolution, in
particular the dissipation of both heat and pressure through the periodic
boundaries during deformation. The research herein explores how the tensile
deformation of amorphous polyethylene, modelled with a united atom method
potential, is influenced by heat and pressure dissipation. The stress-strain
curves for the pressure dissipation cases (uniaxial tension) are in qualitative
agreement with experiments and show that heat dissipation has a large effect on
the strain hardening modulus calculated by molecular dynamics simulations. The
evolution of the energy associated with bonded and non-bonded terms was
quantified as a function of strain as well as the evolution of stress in both
the loading and non-loading directions to give insight into how the stress
state is altered within the elastic, yield, strain softening, and strain
hardening regions. The stress partitioning shows a competition between
`tensile' Van der Waal's interactions and `compressive' bond stretching forces,
with the characteristic yield stress peak clearly associated with the
non-bonded stress. The lack of heat dissipation had the largest effect on the
strain hardening regime, where an increase in the calculated temperature
correlated with faster chain alignment in the loading direction and more rapid
conformation changes. In part, these observations demonstrate the role that
heat and pressure dissipation play on deformation characteristics of amorphous
polymers, particularly for the strain hardening regime.

symmetric manifolds having two asymptotically hyperbolic ends and study the
scattering properties of massless Dirac waves evolving on such manifolds. Using
the spherical symmetry of the model, the stationary scattering is encoded by a
countable family of one-dimensional Dirac equations. This allows us to define
the corresponding transmission coefficients $T(\lambda,n)$ and reflection
coefficients $L(\lambda,n)$ and $R(\lambda,n)$ of a Dirac wave having a fixed

coefficients $L(\lambda,n)$ correspond to the scattering experiment in which a

uniqueness result local in nature. Namely, we prove that for a fixed $\lambda

the Complex Angular Momentum method as well as some useful uniqueness results

ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULX) NGC 1313 X-1 and X-2. The combined spectral
bandpass of the two satellites enables us to produce the first spectrum of X-1
between 0.3 and 30 keV, while X-2 is not significantly detected by NuSTAR above
10 keV. The NuSTAR data demonstrate that X-1 has a clear cutoff above 10 keV,
whose presence was only marginally detectable with previous X-ray observations.
This cutoff rules out the interpretation of X-1 as a black hole in a standard
low/hard state, and it is deeper than predicted for the downturn of a broadened
iron line in a reflection-dominated regime. The cutoff differs from the
prediction of a single-temperature Comptonization model. Further, a cold
disk-like black body component at ~0.3 keV is required by the data, confirming
previous measurements by XMM-Newton only. We observe a spectral transition in
X-2, from a state with high luminosity and strong variability to a
lower-luminosity state with no detectable variability, and we link this
behavior to a transition from a super-Eddington to a sub-Eddington regime.

displayed through the existence of local orthogonal planes of symmetry that we
previously called blades one and two, the loss of symmetry will be manifested
by the tilting of these planes under the influence of the external agent. It
was found already that there is an algorithm to block diagonalize the
Yang-Mills field strength isospace projections in a local gauge invariant way.
Independently, it was also found an algorithm to diagonalize the Yang-Mills
stress-energy tensor in a gauge invariant way. Using these results and
perturbative analysis from a previous manuscript dealing with the Abelian case,
we are going to demonstrate how to develop an algorithm for constructing local
energy-momentum conserved currents inside both local orthogonal planes. As the
interaction proceeds, the planes are going to tilt perturbatively, and in this
strict sense the original local symmetries will be lost. But we will prove that
the new blades at the same point will correspond after the tilting generated by
perturbation, to new symmetries, with associated new local currents, both on

due to Gibrat law and with the growth process following a log-normal
distribution, the ratio between the time (D) for maximum value and the time (L)
for maximum growth rate (inflexion point) is then equal to the square root of
the base of the natural logarithm (e^{1/2}). On the logarithm scale this ratio
becomes one half ((1/2)). It remains an open question, due to lack of complete
data for various cases with restricted growth, whether this e^{1/2} ratio can
be stated as e^{1/2}-Law. Two established examples already published, one for
an epidemic spreading and one for droplet production, support however this
ratio. Another example appears to be the height of humain body. For boys the
maximum height occurs near 23 years old while the maximum growth rate is at the
age near 14, and there ratio is close to e^{1/2}. The main theoretical base to
obtain this conclusion is problem independent, provided the growth process is
restricted, such as public intervention to control the spreading of
communicable epidemics, so that an entropy is associated with the process and
the role of dissipation, representing the mechanism of intervention, is
maximized. Under this formulation the principle of maximum rate of entropy

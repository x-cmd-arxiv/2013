strongly on the composition of the flow. We find that an electron-positron pair
plasma is the least relativistic one. This flow produces only one sonic point
very close to the event horizon and does not show multiple critical points for
any angular momentum or energy. When the baryons are present, the number of
critical points depend on the specific energy content. Since the number of
critical points decide whether the flow will have non-linearities or shock
waves, our results implies that whether or not standing shocks forms will
depend on the flow composition. Thus, for instance, a pure electron-positron
pair plasma will never undergo a shock transition, while mixing it with some
baryons (common in outflows and jets, for example) as in a completely ionized
gas, will have shocks. We study in detail how the baryon loading affects the
shock properties and discuss implication in astrophysical observations.

proposed approach consists in reducing the dimensionality of sensor data made
up of the many pixels of each frame of the input video streams. This enables
finding a concise number of most relevant parameters to model the temporal
dataset, yielding an efficient data-driven model of the evolution of the
observed surface. The second part proposes stochastic modeling to better
capture the patterns embedded in the data. One can then draw samples from the
final model, which are expected to simulate the behavior of previously observed
flow, in order to determine conditions that match new observations. In this

be preferred to parametric and semi-parametric estimators due to relaxed
assumptions that enable robust estimation. Yet, even when misspecified,
parametric and semi-parametric estimators can possess better operating
characteristics in small sample sizes due to smaller variance than
non-parametric estimators. Fundamentally, this is a bias-variance tradeoff
situation in that the sample size is not large enough to take advantage of the
low bias of non-parametric estimation. Stacked survival models estimate an
optimally weighted combination of models that can span parametric,
semi-parametric, and non-parametric models by minimizing prediction error. An
extensive simulation study demonstrates that stacked survival models
consistently perform well across a wide range of scenarios by adaptively
balancing the strengths and weaknesses of individual candidate survival models.
In addition, stacked survival models perform as good as, or better than, the
model selected through cross-validation. Lastly, stacked survival models are
applied to a well-known German breast cancer study.

lower limb muscles of individuals with neuromuscular disorders to produce
cycling as a means of exercise and rehabilitation. However, FES-cycling is
still metabolically inefficient and yields low power output at the cycle crank
compared to able-bodied cycling. Previous literature suggests that these
problems are symptomatic of poor muscle control and non-physiological muscle
fiber recruitment. The latter is a known problem with FES in general, and the
former motivates investigation of better control methods for FES-cycling.In
this paper, a stimulation pattern for quadriceps femoris-only FES-cycling is
derived based on the effectiveness of knee joint torque in producing forward
pedaling. In addition, a switched sliding-mode controller is designed for the
uncertain, nonlinear cycle-rider system with autonomous state-dependent
switching. The switched controller yields ultimately bounded tracking of a
desired trajectory in the presence of an unknown, time-varying, bounded
disturbance, provided a reverse dwell-time condition is satisfied by
appropriate choice of the control gains and a sufficient desired cadence.
Stability is derived through Lyapunov methods for switched systems, and
experimental results demonstrate the performance of the switched control system
under typical cycling conditions.

stability properties of shear flows, which correspond to hydrodynamic
quasinormal modes of the black brane. We find that, for sufficiently high
Reynolds number, the solution undergoes an inverse turbulent cascade to long
wavelength modes. We then map this fluid solution, via the gravity/fluid
duality, into a bulk metric. This suggests a new and interesting feature of the
behavior of perturbed AAdS black holes and black branes, which is not readily
captured by a standard quasinormal mode analysis. Namely, for sufficiently
large perturbed black objects (with long-lived quasinormal modes), nonlinear
effects transfer energy from short to long wavelength modes via a turbulent
cascade within the metric perturbation. As long wavelength modes have slower
decay, this lengthens the overall lifetime of the perturbation. We also discuss
various implications of this behavior, including expectations for higher
dimensions, and the possibility of predicting turbulence in more general
gravitational scenarios.

implementation of an hp-adaptive refinement for the numerical integration to

development of an adaptive extension of an integral convergence acceleration

applicability to media exhibiting arbitrary double anisotropies in each layer,
where one must account for the whole range of possible phenomena such as mode

lines properties at all luminosities ($10^{39}$-$10^{47}$ erg s$^{-1}$). What
produces this similarity over a vast range of $10^8$ in luminosity?
Photoionization is inevitably associated with momentum transfer to the
photoionized gas. Yet, most of the photoionized gas in the Broad Line Region
(BLR) follows Keplerian orbits, which suggests that the BLR originates from gas
with a large enough column for gravity to dominate. The photoionized surface
layer of the gas must develop a pressure gradient due to the incident radiation
force. We present solutions for the structure of such a hydrostatic
photoionized gas layer in the BLR. The gas is stratified, with a low-density
highly-ionized surface layer, a density rise inwards, and a uniform-density
cooler inner region, where the gas pressure reaches the incident radiation
pressure. This radiation pressure confinement (RPC) of the photoionized layer
leads to a universal ionization parameter $U\sim 0.1$ in the inner photoionized
layer, independent of luminosity and distance. Thus, RPC appears to explain the
universality of the BLR properties in AGN. We present predictions for the BLR
emission per unit covering factor, as a function of distance from the ionizing
source, for a range of ionizing continuum slopes and gas metallicity. The
predicted mean strength of most lines (excluding H$\beta$), and their different
average-emission radii, are consistent with the available observations.

  Application to a Continuous Inverse Kinematics Problem","Revised version from December 2013",,,,"math.DG cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Using results on the topology of moduli space of polygons [Jaggi, 92;
Kapovich and Millson, 94], it can be shown that for a planar robot arm with $n$
segments there are some values of the base-length, $z$, at which the
configuration space of the constrained arm (arm with its end effector fixed)
has two disconnected components, while at other values the constrained
configuration space has one connected component. We first review some of these
known results.
  Then the main design problem addressed in this paper is the construction of
pairs of continuous inverse kinematics for arbitrary robot arms, with the
property that the two inverse kinematics agree when the constrained
configuration space has a single connected component, but they give distinct
configurations (one in each connected component) when the configuration space
of the constrained arm has two components. This design is made possible by a
fundamental theoretical contribution in this paper -- a classification of
configuration spaces of robot arms such that the type of path that the system
(robot arm) takes through certain critical values of the forward kinematics
function is completely determined by the class to which the configuration space
of the arm belongs. This classification result makes the aforesaid design
problem tractable, making it sufficient to design a pair of inverse kinematics
for each class of configuration spaces (three of them in total).
  We discuss the motivation for this work, which comes from a more extensive
problem of motion planning for the end effector of a robot arm requiring us to
continuously sample one configuration from each connected component of the
constrained configuration spaces.

provided, and a simpler expression for a lower bound is derived for the case of
a non-negative decoding metric. The general formula is specialized to the case
of finite input and output alphabet channels with a type-dependent metric. The
closely related problem of threshold mismatched decoding is also studied, and a
general expression for the threshold mismatch capacity is obtained. As an
example of threshold mismatch capacity, we state a general expression for the
erasures-only capacity of the finite input and output alphabet channel. We
observe that for every channel there exists a (matched) threshold decoder which
is capacity achieving. Additionally, necessary and sufficient conditions are
stated for a channel to have a strong converse. Csisz\'{a}r and Narayan's
conjecture is proved for bounded metrics, providing a positive answer to the
open problem introduced in [1], i.e., that the ""product-space"" improvement of
the lower random coding bound, $C_q^{(\infty)}(W)$, is indeed the mismatch
capacity of the discrete memoryless channel $W$. We conclude by presenting an
identity between the threshold capacity and $C_q^{(\infty)}(W)$ in the DMC
case.

accounts for a wide range of physiological responses at different types of

behavior via a Shilnikov homoclinic bifurcation that dynamically organises some
of the responses in the TM model. In particular, the presence of such a
homoclinic bifurcation strongly affects the shape of the trajectories in the
phase space and induces highly irregular transient dynamics; indeed, in the
vicinity of the Shilnikov homoclinic bifurcation, the number of population
spikes and their precise timing are unpredictable and highly sensitive to the
initial conditions. Such an irregular deterministic dynamics has its
counterpart in stochastic/network versions of the TM model: the existence of
the Shilnikov homoclinic bifurcation generates complex and irregular spiking
patterns and --acting as a sort of springboard-- facilitates transitions
between the down-state and unstable periodic orbits. The interplay between the
(deterministic) homoclinic bifurcation and stochastic effects may give rise to
some of the complex dynamics observed in neural systems.

conduction and valence band energies touch each other only at isolated points
in momentum space (i.e. the 3D Dirac points), and thus it cannot be classified
either as a metal or a semiconductor. In contrast to graphene, the Dirac points
of such a semimetal are not gapped by the spin-orbit interaction and the
crossing of the linear dispersions is protected by crystal symmetry. In
combination with broken time-reversal or inversion symmetries, 3D Dirac points
may result in a variety of topologically non-trivial phases with unique
physical properties. They have, however, escaped detection in real solids so
far. Here we report the direct observation of such an exotic electronic
structure in cadmium arsenide (Cd3As2) by means of angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES). We identify two momentum regions where electronic states
that strongly disperse in all directions form narrow cone-like structures, and
thus prove the existence of the long sought 3D Dirac points. This electronic
structure naturally explains why Cd3As2 has one of the highest known bulk
electron mobilities. This realization of a 3D Dirac semimetal in Cd3As2 not

even claims that every physical event is a computation. In this paper we
introduce a formal framework that can be used to determine whether or not a

comparison with the use of mathematical models to represent physical objects in
experimental science. This powerful formulation allows a precise description of
the similarities between experiments, computation, simulation, and technology,
leading to our central conclusion: physical computing is the use of a physical
system to predict the outcome of an abstract evolution. We give conditions that
must be satisfied in order for computation to be occurring, and illustrate
these with a range of non-standard computing scenarios. The framework also
covers broader computing contexts, where there is no obvious human computer
user. We define the critical notion of a 'computational entity', and show the
role this plays in defining when computing is taking place in physical systems.

interest in its own right. We show that under the suitable (thermodynamic)
limit both measures have the similar critical behaviour of the cycle statistics
characterized by the emergence of infinitely long cycles. Moreover, using a
greater analytic tractability of the surrogate-spatial model, we obtain a
number of new results about the asymptotic distribution of the cycle lengths

supercritical domains. In particular, in the supercritical regime there is a
parametric ""phase transition"" from the Poisson-Dirichlet limiting distribution
of ordered cycles to the occurrence of a single giant cycle. Our techniques are

various results from computational models and empirical results. These results
will be organized into a vertical model of social complexity. This will support
the perspective that social complexity is in essence an emergent phenomenon
while helping to answer two interrelated questions. The first of these involves
how behavior is integrated at units of analysis larger than the individual
organism. The second involves placing aggregate social events into the context
of processes occurring within individual organisms over time (e.g. genomic and
physiological processes). By using a complex systems perspective, five
principles of social complexity can be identified. These principles suggest
that lower-level mechanisms give rise to high-level mechanisms, ultimately
resulting in metastable networks of social relations. These network structures
then constrain lower-level phenomena ranging from transient, collective social
groups to physiological regulatory mechanisms within individual organisms. In
conclusion, the broader implications and drawbacks of applying the theory to a
diversity of natural populations will be discussed.

present-day strength of the field, $B_0$, smoothed over a certain Gaussian
width, $k_c^{-1}$, and spectral index, $n_B$, defined by $P_B(k)\propto
k^{n_B}$. For $n_B=-2.9$ and $k_c^{-1}=1 {\rm Mpc}$, the COBE/FIRAS limit on

stronger. For $B_0=1$ nG with $k_c^{-1}=1 {\rm Mpc}$, the COBE/FIRAS limit on
$\mu$ excludes a wide range of spectral indices given by $n_B>-2.6$. After
decoupling, energy dissipation is due to ambipolar diffusion and decaying MHD
turbulence, creating a $y$-type distortion. The distortion is completely
dominated by decaying MHD turbulence, and is of order $y\approx 10^{-7}$ for a
few nG field smoothed over the damping scale at the decoupling epoch,
$k_{d,dec}\approx 290 (B_0/1 {\rm nG})^{-1} {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. This contribution
is as large as those of the known contributions such as reionization and
virialized objects at lower redshifts. The projected PIXIE limit on $y$ would
exclude $B_0>1.0$ and 0.6 nG for $n_B=-2.9$ and -2.3, respectively, and
$B_0>0.6$ nG for $n_B\geq 2$. The current limits on the optical depth to
Thomson scattering restrict the predicted $y$-type distortion to be $y\lesssim
10^{-8}$. (Abridged)

and its evolution with cosmic time. We find that for most BL Lac classes, the
evolution is positive with a space density peaking at modest redshift (z~1.2).
The low-luminosity, high-synchrotron peaked (HSP) BL Lacs are an exception,
showing strong negative evolution, with number density increasing for
z$\lesssim$0.5. Since this rise corresponds to a drop-off in the density of
flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), a possible interpretation is that these
HSPs represent an accretion-starved end-state of an earlier merger-driven
gas-rich phase. We additionally find that the known BL Lac correlation between
luminosity and photon spectral index persists after correction for the
substantial observational selection effects with implications for the so called
`blazar sequence'. Finally, estimating the beaming corrections to the
luminosity function, we find that BL Lacs have an average Lorentz factor of

  formation budget","MNRAS Letters in press",,"10.1093/mnrasl/slt136",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We estimate an empirical lower limit for the fraction of cosmic star
formation that is triggered by minor mergers in the local Universe. Splitting
the star-formation budget by galaxy morphology, we find that early-type
galaxies (ETGs) host ~14% of the budget, while Sb/Sc galaxies host the bulk
(~53%) of the local star formation activity. Recent work indicates that star
formation in nearby ETGs is driven by minor mergers, implying that at least
~14% of local star formation is triggered by this process. A more accurate
estimate can be derived by noting that an infalling satellite likely induces a
larger starburst in a galaxy of 'later' morphological type, both due to higher
availability of gas in the accreting galaxy and because a bigger bulge better
stabilizes the disk against star formation. This enables us to use the star
formation in ETGs to estimate a lower limit for the fraction of star formation
in late-type galaxies (LTGs) that is minor-merger-driven. Using a subsample of
ETGs that is mass and environment-matched to the LTGs (implying a similar
infalling satellite population), we estimate this limit to be ~24%. Thus, a
lower limit for the fraction of cosmic star formation that is induced by minor
mergers is ~35% (14% [ETGs] + 0.24 x 86% [LTGs]). The observed positive
correlation between black hole and galaxy mass further implies that a similar
fraction of black hole accretion may also be triggered by minor mergers.
Detailed studies of minor-merger remnants are therefore essential, to quantify
the role of this important process in driving stellar mass and black hole
growth in the local Universe.

displays a clear anomaly induced by a second lensing mass, was inside the
footprint of our second-generation microlensing survey, involving MOA, OGLE and
the Wise Observatory. The event was observed by the survey groups, without
prompting alerts that could have led to dedicated follow-up observations.
Fitting a microlensing model to the data, we find that the timescale of the
event was t_E=23.2 +/-0.8 days, and the mass ratio between the lens star and
its companion is q=0.028 +/-0.001. Finite-source effects are marginally
detected, and upper limits on them help break some of the degeneracy in the
system parameters. Using a Bayesian analysis that incorporates a Galactic
structure model, we estimate the mass of the lens at 0.39 +0.45/-0.19 M_sun, at
a distance of 7.56 +/-0.91 kpc. Thus, the companion is likely a planet of mass
11.6 +13.4/-5.6 M_J, at a projected separation of 4.3 +1.5/-1.2 AU, rather far
beyond the snow line. This is the first pure-survey planet reported from a

performed as part of the CLUES project. We vary the source models to bracket
the range of source properties used in the literature. We investigate the
structure and propagation of the galatic ionization fronts by a visual
examination of our reionization maps. Within the progenitors we find that
reionization is patchy, and proceeds locally inside out. The process becomes
patchier with decreasing source photon output. It is generally dominated by one
major HII region and 1-4 additional isolated smaller bubbles, which eventually
overlap. Higher emissivity results in faster and earlier local reionization. In
all models, the reionization of the Milky Way and M31 are similar in duration,
i.e. between 203 Myr and 22 Myr depending on the source model, placing their
zreion between 8.4 and 13.7. In all models except the most extreme, the MW and
M31 progenitors reionize internally, ignoring each other, despite being
relatively close to each other even during the epoch of reionization. Only in
the case of strong supernova feedback suppressing star formation in haloes less

galactocentric radius in contradiction to the expectations from a model of a
randomly sampled constant cluster mass function with a constant upper mass
limit. Pure stochastic star formation is thereby ruled out. We use this example
to elucidate how naive analysis of data can lead to unphysical conclusions.

corresponds to a roughly 0.16 Msun WD, making it the coolest and lowest-mass
pulsating WD known. There are multiple ELM WDs with effective temperatures
between the warmest and coolest known ELM pulsators that do not pulsate to
observable amplitudes, which questions the purity of the instability strip for
low-mass WDs. In contrast to the CO-core ZZ Ceti stars, which are believed to
represent a stage in the evolution of all such WDs, ELM WDs may not all evolve
as a simple cooling sequence through an instability strip. Both stars exhibit
long-period variability (1184-6235 s) consistent with non-radial g-mode
pulsations. Although ELM WDs are preferentially found in close binary systems,
both J1614 and J2228 do not exhibit significant radial-velocity variability,
and are perhaps in low-inclination systems or have low-mass companions. These
are the fourth and fifth pulsating ELM WDs known, all of which have
hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, establishing these objects as a new class of
pulsating WD.

view. Evidence for a central bar, for example, is not reflected in the
distribution of RR Lyrae variables in the central bulge [4,5], and it is not
clear if either a 2-armed or 4-armed spiral pattern is appropriate for the
spiral arms. Radial velocity mapping of the Galaxy using radio H I, H II, or CO
observations is compromised by the assumptions adopted for simple Galactic
rotation. The Sun's local standard of rest (LSR) velocity is $\sim 14$ km
s$^{-1}$ rather than 20 km s$^{-1}$, the local circular velocity is $251 \pm 9$
km s$^{-1}$ rather than 220 km s$^{-1}$, and young groups of stars exhibit a
10--20 km s$^{-1}$ ""kick"" relative to what is expected from Galactic rotation.
By implication, the same may be true for star-forming gas clouds affected by
the Galaxy's spiral density wave, raising concerns about their use for mapping
spiral arms. Proper motion data in conjunction with the newly-estimated
velocity components for the Sun's motion imply a distance to the Galactic
centre of $R_0=8.34\pm0.27$ kpc, consistent with recent estimates which average
$8.24\pm0.09$ kpc. A cosinusoidal Galactic potential is not ruled out by
observations of open star clusters. The planetary nebula cluster Bica 6, for
example, has a near-escape orbit for a Newtonian potential, but a near-normal
orbit in a cosinusoidal potential field. The nearby cluster Collinder 464 also
displays unusually large tidal effects consistent with those expected for a
cosinusoidal potential. A standard Newtonian version of the Virial Theorem for
star clusters yields very reasonable masses ($\sim 3 \times 10^{11}M_{\odot}$
and $\sim 4 \times 10^{11}M_{\odot}$) for the Milky Way and M31 subgroups of
the Local Group, respectively. A cosinusoidal relation should yield identical
results.

the gravity side difficult, while the CFT is strongly coupled and the planar

states on the gravity side with large angular momentum J>>1 and identify the
dual operators in the CFT, thereby establishing the AdS/CFT dictionary in this
sector. Natural approximation schemes arise on both sides thanks to the
presence of the small parameter 1/J. On the AdS side, we use the matrix model
of M-theory on the maximally supersymmetric pp-wave background with matrices of

approximation to M-theory in AdS_4xS^7/Z_k when N^{1/3}<<J<<N^{1/2}. On the CFT
side, we study the theory on S^2xR with magnetic flux J/k. A Born-Oppenheimer
type expansion arises naturally for large J in spite of the theory being
strongly coupled. The energy spectra on the two sides agree at leading order.
This provides a non-trivial test of the AdS_4/CFT_3 correspondence including
near-BPS observables associated with membrane degrees of freedom, thus
verifying the duality beyond the previously studied sectors corresponding to

  First, we show the existence of a good product-state approximation for the
ground-state energy of 2-local Hamiltonians with one or more of the following
properties: (1) high degree, (2) small expansion, or (3) a ground state with
sublinear entanglement with respect to some partition into small pieces. The
approximation based on degree is a surprising difference between quantum
Hamiltonians and classical CSPs (constraint satisfaction problems), since in
the classical setting, higher degree is usually associated with harder CSPs.
The approximation based on low entanglement, in turn, was previously known only
in the regime where the entanglement was close to zero. Since the existence of
a low-energy product state can be checked in NP, the result implies that any
Hamiltonian used for a quantum PCP theorem should have: (1) constant degree,
(2) constant expansion, (3) a ""volume law"" for entanglement with respect to any
partition into small parts.
  Second, we show that in several cases, good product-state approximations not
only exist, but can be found in polynomial time: (1) 2-local Hamiltonians on
any planar graph, solving an open problem of Bansal, Bravyi, and Terhal, (2)
dense k-local Hamiltonians for any constant k, solving an open problem of
Gharibian and Kempe, and (3) 2-local Hamiltonians on graphs with low threshold

Steurer.

of clear absorption dips, both of which recur on a dip interval of 9.74 +- 0.04
hours, which we identify with the orbital period. There is also partially
ionized absorption in the non-dip (persistent) emission in both the high/soft
state and, very unusually, the low/hard state. However, this absorption (in
both states) has substantially lower ionization than that seen in other high
inclination systems, where the material forms a homogeneous disk wind. Here
instead the absorption is most probably associated with clumpy, compact
structures associated with the dipping material, which we see uniquely in this
source likely because we view it at a very large inclination angle. A large
inclination angle is also favored, together with a low black hole mass, to
explain the high disk temperature seen in the fairly low luminosity high/soft
state, as Doppler boosting enhances the disk temperature at high inclination.
The disk radius inferred from these data is significantly smaller than that of
the soft component seen in the low/hard state, supporting models where the disk
is truncated at low luminosities. We find, however, that the lack of
variability power on time scales of ~50 sec in the Suzaku low/hard state data
is difficult to explain, even with a low mass black hole.

for the ensemble halo. We use a Ks-band selected catalogue for the 10 clusters

photometric redshifts and stellar masses measured from 11-band SED fitting.
Combining the photometric catalogues with the deep spectroscopic component of
GCLASS, we correct the cluster galaxy sample for interlopers. We also perform a
dynamical analysis of the cluster galaxies to estimate the halo mass M200 for
each cluster based on a measurement of its velocity dispersion. (1) We find
that the central galaxy stellar mass fraction decreases with total halo mass,
and that this is in reasonable quantitative agreement with measurements from
abundance matching studies at z~1. (2) The total stellar mass fractions of
these systems decrease with halo mass, indicating that lower mass systems are
more efficient at transforming baryons into stars. We find the total stellar
mass to be a good proxy for total halo mass, with a small intrinsic scatter.
When we compare these results with literature measurements, we find that the
stellar mass fraction at fixed halo mass shows no significant evolution in the
range 0<z<1. (3) We measure a relatively high NFW concentration parameter c ~ 7
for the stellar mass distribution in these clusters. A simple model shows that
the stellar mass content of GCLASS can evolve in typical distributions observed
at lower redshifts if the clusters primarily accrete stellar mass onto the
outskirts. [Abridged]

(strong-)lensing studies by Halkola et al. (2008) and Bradac et al. (2008), as
well as by incorporating newly available data from the Cluster Lensing And
Supernovae survey with Hubble (CLASH, Postman et al. 2012), we identified four
systems of multiply lensed images (anew) in the redshift range 1.75 <= z <=
4.19. One multiple image system consists of in total eight multiply lensed
images of the same source. The analysis based on a parametric mass model
derived with the software glafic (Oguri 2010) suggests that the high image
multiplicity is due to the source (z_phot = 4.19) being located on a so-called
""swallowtail"" caustic. In addition to the parametric mass model, we also
employed a non-parametric approach using the software PixeLens (Saha and
Williams 1997, 2004) in order to reconstruct the projected mass of the cluster
using the same strong lensing data input.
  Both reconstructed mass models agree in revealing several mass components and
a highly elliptic shape of the mass distribution. Furthermore, the projected
mass inside, for example, a radius R ~35 arcsec ~200 kpc of the cluster for a
source at redshift z=1.75 obtained with PixeLens exceeds the glafic estimate
within the same radius by about 13 per cent. The difference could be related to
the fundamental degeneracy involved when constraining dark matter substructures

distribution of mass, determined from weak lensing observations, and starlight,
around $>10^5$ SDSS MaxBCG groups and clusters as a function of environment and
scale, from deep inside clusters to large cosmic scales of $22 h^{-1}$ Mpc. The
observed cumulative mass-to-light profile, $M/L (< r)$, rises on small scales,
reflecting the increasing $M/L$ of the central bright galaxy of the cluster,
then flattens to a nearly constant ratio on scales above $\sim 300 h^{-1}$ kpc,
where light follows mass on all scales and in all environments. A trend of
slightly decreasing $M/L (r)$ with scale is shown to be consistent with the
varying stellar population following the morphology-density relation. This
suggests that stars trace mass remarkably well even though they represent only
a few percent of the total mass. We determine the stellar mass fraction and
find it to be nearly constant on all scales above $\sim 300 h^{-1}$ kpc, with
$M_{*}/M_{tot} \simeq 1.0\pm0.4\%$. We further suggest that most of the dark
matter in the Universe is located in the large halos of individual galaxies
($\sim 300$ kpc for $L^{*}$ galaxies); we show that the entire $M/L (r)$
profile -- from groups and clusters to large-scale structure -- can be
accounted for by the aggregate masses of the individual galaxies (whose halos
may be stripped off but still remain in the clusters), plus gas. We use the
observed mass-to-light ratio on large scales to determine the mass density of
the Universe: $\Omega_{m} = 0.24 \pm 0.02 \times b_{M/L}^{2} = 0.26 \pm 0.02.$

possibly two discs. In this paper, we study the perturbations exerted on a thin
stellar disc (with outer radius ~0.4 pc) by a molecular cloud that falls
towards the GC and is disrupted by the supermassive black hole (SMBH). The
initial conditions for the stellar disc were drawn from the results of previous
simulations of molecular cloud infall and disruption in the SMBH potential. We
find that most of the gas from the disrupted molecular cloud settles into a
dense and irregular disc surrounding the SMBH. If the gas disc and the stellar
disc are slightly misaligned (~5-20 deg), the precession of the stellar orbits
induced by the gas disc significantly increases the inclinations of the stellar
orbits (by a factor of ~3-5 in 1.5 Myr) with respect to the normal vector to
the disc. Furthermore, the distribution of orbit inclinations becomes
significantly broader. These results might be the clue to explain the broad
distribution of observed inclinations of the early-type stars with respect to
the normal vector of the main disc. We discuss the implications for the
possibility that fresh gas was accreted by the GC after the formation of the

extinction is minimal. The submm line luminosities are therefore directly

some hints from the analysis of the F140LP HST filter. This matching is
impossible to achieve by assuming either a bulgy satellite, or a young star

signal. If dark matter exists as WDM instead of cold dark matter (CDM), its
non-negligible velocities can inhibit the formation of low-mass halos that
normally form first in CDM models, therefore delaying star-formation. The
absence of early sources delays the build-up of UV and X-ray backgrounds that
affect the 21-cm radiation signal produced by neutral hydrogen. With use of the
21CMFAST, code, we demonstrate that the pre-reionization 21-cm signal can be
changed significantly in WDM models with a free-streaming length equivalent to
that of a thermal relic with mass mx of up to ~10-20 keV. In such a WDM
cosmology, the 21-cm signal traces the growth of more massive halos, resulting
in a delay of the 21-cm absorption signature and followed by accelerated X-ray
heating. CDM models where astrophysical sources have a suppressed
photon-production efficiency can delay the 21-cm signal as well, although its
subsequent evolution is not as rapid as compared to WDM. This motivates using
the gradient of the global 21-cm signal to differentiate between some CDM and
WDM models. Finally, we show that the degeneracy between the astrophysics and
mx can be broken with the 21-cm power spectrum, as WDM models should have a
bias-induced excess of power on large scales. This boost in power should be
detectable with current interferometers for models with mx < 3 keV, while next
generation instruments will easily be able to measure this difference for all
relevant WDM models.

is not a true vacuum state. In the closely related case of particle creation by
a constant, uniform electric field, a time symmetric state analogous to the de

between a possibly existing bank account process and the term structure of bond

argue that this feature is not the exception but rather the rule in bond
markets when starting with, e.g., terminal bonds as num\'eraires.
  Our setting are general c\`adl\`ag processes as bond prices, where we employ
directly methods from large financial markets. Moreover, we do not restrict
price process to be semimartingales, which allows for example to consider
markets driven by fractional Brownian motion. In the core of the article we
relate the appropriate no arbitrage assumptions (NAFL), i.e. no asymptotic free
lunch, to the existence of an equivalent local martingale measure with respect
to the terminal bond as num\'eraire, and no arbitrage opportunities of the
first kind (NAA1) to the existence of a supermartingale deflator, respectively.
In all settings we obtain existence of a generalized bank account as a limit of
convex combinations of roll-over bonds.
  Additionally we provide an alternative definition of the concept of a
num\'eraire, leading to a possibly interesting connection to bubbles. If we can
construct a bank account process through roll-overs, we can relate the
impossibility of taking the bank account as num\'eraire to liquidity effects.
Here we enter endogenously the arena of multiple yield curves.
  The theory is illustrated by several examples.

  by Minimizing Sum of Errors Type I and Type II",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Our purpose, is to put forward a change in the paradigm of testing by
generalizing a very natural idea exposed by Morris DeGroot (1975) aiming to an
approach that is attractive to all schools of statistics, in a procedure better
suited for the needs of science. DeGroot's seminal idea is to base testing
statistical hypothesis on minimizing the weighted sum of type I plus type II
error instead of of the prevailing paradigm which is fixing type I error and
minimizing type II error. DeGroot's result is that in simple vs simple
hypothesis the optimal criterion is to reject, according to the likelihood
ratio as the evidence (ordering) statistics using a fixed threshold value,
instead of a fixed tail probability. By defining expected type I and type II
errors, we generalize DeGroot's approach and find that the optimal region is
defined by the ratio of evidences, that is, averaged likelihoods (with respect
to a prior measure) and a threshold fixed. This approach yields an optimal
theory in complete generality, which the Classical Theory of Testing does not.
This can be seen as a Bayes-Non-Bayes compromise: the criteria (weighted sum of
type I and type II errors) is Frequentist, but the test criterion is the ratio
of marginalized likelihood, which is Bayesian. We give arguments, to push the
theory still further, so that the weighting measures (priors)of the likelihoods
does not have to be proper and highly informative, but just predictively
matched, that is that predictively matched priors, give rise to the same
evidence (marginal likelihoods) using minimal (smallest) training samples. The
theory that emerges, similar to the theories based on Objective Bayes
approaches, is a powerful response to criticisms of the prevailing approach of
hypothesis testing, see for example Ioannidis (2005) and Siegfried (2010) among
many others.

(fractional root-mean-square variability - rms - amplitude of $\sim$ 30 percent
in the hard energy band), the hardening of the fractional rms spectrum, and the
properties of the QPO, all resemble those of a source in a hard-intermediate
accretion state. We confirm the previous detection of a soft lag in the X-ray
light curves of the source during 2006 and 2008 observations and find that the
soft lag is still present in the more recent 2010/2011 observations. Using the
entire available XMM-Newton data set (public as of February 2012) we observe
that the soft lag (of few seconds amplitude) is detected over a relatively
large range of frequencies ($\nu \sim 5-90$ mHz), which always includes the QPO
frequencies. The soft lag displays energy-dependence, with the (absolute)
amplitude increasing as a function of energy separation. We find close
analogies with soft lags associated to type-C QPOs in BH binary systems
(although an association to other types of QPOs cannot be completely excluded),
as well as with reverberation lags observed in AGN. In both cases an

forms, as representatives of equivalence classes under right equivalence, are
not always uniquely determined. We describe the complete structure of the
equivalence classes of the unimodal real singularities of corank 2. In other

A unified equation of state (EoS) should describe the crust and the
core of a neutron star using the same physical model. The Brussels-Montreal
group has recently derived a family of such EoSs based on the nuclear
energy-density functional theory with generalized Skyrme effective forces,
fitted to the available mass data. At the same time, these forces were
constrained to reproduce microscopic calculations of homogeneous neutron matter
based on realistic two- and three-nucleon forces.
  Aims. We represent basic physical characteristics of the latest
Brussels-Montreal EoS models by analytical expressions to facilitate their
inclusion in astrophysical simulations.
  Methods. We consider three EoS models, which significantly differ by
stiffness: BSk19, BSk20, and BSk21. For each of them we constructed two
versions of the EoS parametrization. In the first version, pressure P and
gravitational mass density \rho are given as functions of the baryon number
density n_b. In the second version, P, \rho, and n_b are given as functions of
pseudo-enthalpy, which is useful for two-dimensional calculations of stationary
rotating configurations of neutron stars. In addition to the EoS, we derived
analytical expressions for several related quantities that are required in
neutron-star simulations: number fractions of electrons and muons in the
stellar core, nucleon numbers per nucleus in the inner crust, and equivalent
radii and shape parameters of the nuclei in the inner crust.
  Results. We obtain analytical representations for the basic characteristics
of the models of cold dense matter, which are most important for studies of
neutron stars. We demonstrate the usability of our results by applying them to
calculations of neutron-star mass-radius relations, maximum and minimum masses,
thresholds of direct Urca processes, and the electron conductivity in the
neutron-star crust.

however, that this formalism is invalid in light of absorber clustering and use
a toy model to estimate the effects. Future work must properly account for the
non-Poissonian nature of the IGM.

A
distributed storage system (DSS) is parameterized by three parameters (n, k,d),
in which a file stored across n distributed nodes, can be recovered from any k
out of n nodes. If a node fails, any d out of (n-1) nodes help in the repair of
the failed node. For such a (n,k,d)-DSS, two types of wiretapping scenarios are
investigated: (a) Type-I (node) adversary which can wiretap the data stored on
any l<k nodes; and a more severe (b) Type-II (repair data) adversary which can
wiretap the contents of the repair data that is used to repair a set of l
failed nodes over time. The focus of this work is on the practically relevant
setting of exact repair regeneration in which the repair process must replace a
failed node by its exact replica. We make new progress on several non-trivial
instances of this problem which prior to this work have been open. The main
contribution of this paper is the optimal characterization of the secure
storage-vs-exact-repair-bandwidth tradeoff region of a (n,k,d)-DSS, with n<=4
and any l<k in the presence of both Type-I and Type-II adversaries. While the
problem remains open for a general (n,k,d)-DSS with n>4, we present extensions
of these results to a (n, n-1,n-1)-DSS, in presence of a Type-II adversary that
can observe the repair data of any l=(n-2) nodes. The key technical
contribution of this work is in developing novel information theoretic converse
proofs for the Type-II adversarial scenario. From our results, we show that in
the presence of Type-II attacks, the only efficient point in the
storage-vs-exact-repair-bandwidth tradeoff is the MBR (minimum bandwidth
regenerating) point. This is in sharp contrast to the case of a Type-I attack
in which the storage-vs-exact-repair-bandwidth tradeoff allows a spectrum of
operating points beyond the MBR point.

failures that inhibit fair exchange, such as monopoly or transactions with
hidden costs. Because regulations reduce profits to those possessing unfair
advantage, these advantaged corporations (whether individuals, companies, or
other collective organizations) are motivated to influence regulators.
Regulatory bodies created to protect the market are instead co-opted to advance
the interests of the corporations they are charged to regulate. This
wide-spread influence, known as ""regulatory capture,"" has been recognized for
over 100 years, and according to expectations of rational behavior, will exist
wherever it is in the mutual self-interest of corporations and regulators. Here
we model the interaction between corporations and regulators using a new game
theory framework explicitly accounting for players' mutual influence, and
demonstrate the incentive for collusion. Communication between corporations and
regulators enables them to collude and split the resulting profits. We identify
when collusion is profitable for both parties. The intuitive results show that
capture occurs when the benefits to the corporation outweigh the costs to the
regulator. Under these conditions, the corporation can compensate the regulator
for costs incurred and, further, provide a profit to both parties. In the real
world, benefits often far outweigh costs, providing large incentives to collude
and making capture likely. Regulatory capture is inhibited by decreasing the
influence between parties through strict separation, independent market
knowledge and research by regulators, regulatory and market transparency,
regulatory accountability for market failures, widely distributed regulatory
control, and anti-corruption enforcement.

Tikhonov regularization is the choice of the regularization parameter that
controls the trade off between the data fidelity and the stabilizing
functional. The L-curve and generalized cross validation techniques, which only
require the relative sizes of the uncertainties in the observations are
considered. Both criteria are applied in an iterative process for which at each
iteration a value for regularization parameter is estimated. Suitable values
for the regularization parameter are successfully determined in both cases for
synthetic but practically relevant examples. Whenever the geologic situation
permits, it is easier and more efficient to model the subsurface with a 2-D
algorithm, rather than to apply a full 3-D approach. Then, because the problem
is not large it is appropriate to use the generalized singular value
decomposition for solving the problem efficiently. The method is applied on a
profile of gravity data acquired over the Safo mining camp in Maku-Iran, which
is well known for manganese ores. The presented results demonstrate success in
reconstructing the geometry and density distribution of the subsurface source.

  5 pages, 2 figures",,,,"astro-ph.IM astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Telescope Array Low-Energy Extension (TALE) is a hybrid, Air Fluorescence
Detector (FD) / Scintillator Array, designed to study cosmic ray initiated
showers at energies above $\sim3\times10^{16}$ eV. Located in the western Utah
desert, the TALE FD is comprised of 10 telescopes which cover the elevation
range 31-58$^{\circ}$ in addition to 14 telescopes with elevation coverage of
3-31$^{\circ}$.
  As with all other FD's, a subset of the shower events recorded by TALE are
ones for which the Cerenkov light produced by the shower particles dominates
the total observed light signal. In fact, for the telescopes with higher
elevation coverage, low energy Cerenkov events form the vast majority of
triggered cosmic ray events. In the typical FD data analysis procedure, this
subset of events is discarded and only events for which the majority of signal
photons come from air fluorescence are kept.
  In this talk, I will report on a study to reconstruct the ""Cerenkov Events""
seen by the high elevation viewing telescopes of TALE. Monte Carlo studies and
a first look at real events observed by TALE look very promising. Even as a
monocular detector, the geometrical reconstruction method employed in this
analysis allows for a pointing accuracy on the order of a degree. Preliminary
Monte Carlo studies indicate that, the expected energy resolution is better
than 25$%$. It may be possible to extend the low energy reach of TALE to below
$10^{16}$ eV. This would be the first time a detector designed specifically as
an air fluorescence detector is used as an imaging Cerenkov detector.

capable of transmitting a text message using chemical signalling -- a method
also known as molecular communication. This form of communication is attractive
for applications where conventional wireless systems perform poorly, from
nanotechnology to urban health monitoring. Using examples, we demonstrate the
use of our platform as a testbed for molecular communication, and illustrate
the features of these communication systems using experiments. By providing a
simple and inexpensive means of performing experiments, our system fills an
important gap in the molecular communication literature, where much current
work is done in simulation with simplified system models. A key finding in this
paper is that these systems are often nonlinear in practice, whereas current
simulations and analysis often assume that the system is linear. However, as we
show in this work, despite the nonlinearity, reliable communication is still
possible. Furthermore, this work motivates future studies on more realistic
modelling, analysis, and design of theoretical models and algorithms for these
systems.

MeV $\gamma$s from neutron-capture on protons following neutrino interactions.
Low-energy CC interactions where the oscillation excess is observed should have
associated neutrons with less than a 10% probability. This is in contrast to
the NC backgrounds that should have associated neutrons in approximately 50% of
events. We will measure these neutron fractions with $\nu_\mu$ CC and NC events
to eliminate that systematic uncertainty. This neutron-fraction measurement
requires $6.5\times10^{20}$ protons on target delivered to MiniBooNE with
scintillator added in order to increase the significance of an oscillation
excess to over $5\sigma$.
  This new phase of MiniBooNE will also enable additional important studies
such as the spin structure of nucleon ($\Delta s$) via NC elastic scattering, a
low-energy measurement of the neutrino flux via $\numu ^{12}C \rightarrow
\mu^{-} ^{12}N_\textrm{g.s.}$ scattering, and a test of the quasielastic
assumption in neutrino energy reconstruction. These topics will yield

different role of the disk dynamics, depending on the location within the disk.
In particular, we highlight the impact of the pitch angle of the spiral arm in
the development of either type of structure.

0.29 to 1.027{\mu}m with STIS, which is coupled with a recent WFC3 transit
(1.087 to 1.687{\mu}m). We derive refined physical parameters of the HAT-P-1
system, including an improved orbital ephemeris. The transmission spectrum
shows a strong absorption signature shortward of 0.55{\mu}m, with a strong
blueward slope into the near-ultraviolet. We detect atmospheric sodium
absorption at a 3.3{\sigma} significance level, but find no evidence for the
potassium feature. The red data implies a marginally flat spectrum with a
tentative absorption enhancement at wavelength longer than ~0.85{\mu}m. The
STIS and WFC3 spectra differ significantly in absolute radius level (4.3 +/-
1.6 pressure scale heights), implying strong optical absorption in the
atmosphere of HAT-P-1b. The optical to near-infrared difference cannot be
explained by stellar activity, as simulta- neous stellar activity monitoring of
the G0V HAT-P-1b host star and its identical companion show no significant
activity that could explain the result. We compare the complete STIS and WFC3
transmission spectrum with theoretical atmospheric mod- els which include haze,
sodium and an extra optical absorber. We find that both an optical absorber and
a super-solar sodium to water abundance ratio might be a sce- nario explaining

scientific objectives relate to probing various aspects of Einstein's theory of
general relativity by measuring the gravitational red-shift of the earth, the
moon and the sun as well as testing the weak equivalence principle to
unprecedented accuracy. In order to perform the measurements, the system
features a spacecraft equipped with two complex instruments, an atomic clock
and an atom interferometer, a ground-segment encompassing several
ground-terminals collocated with the best available ground atomic clocks, and
clock comparison between space and ground via microwave and optical links. The
baseline orbit is highly eccentric and exhibits strong variations of incident
solar flux, which poses challenges for thermal and power subsystems in addition
to the difficulties encountered by precise-orbit-determination at high
altitudes. The mission assessment and definition phase (Phase-A) has recently
been completed and this paper gives a concise overview over some system level

sample of proton-antiproton collisions recorded with the CDF II detector at the

the sensitivity to vector boson decays into pairs of quarks using a neural
network discriminant that exploits the differences between the spatial spread
of energy depositions and charged-particle momenta contained within the jet of
particles originating from quarks and gluons. Additionally, we employ new jet
energy corrections to Monte Carlo simulations that account for differences in
the observed energy scales for quark and gluon jets. The number of signal
events is extracted through a simultaneous fit to the dijet mass spectrum in
three classes of events: events likely to contain jets with a heavy-quark
decay, events likely to contain jets originating from light quarks, and events
that fail these identification criteria. We determine the production cross
section to be 2.5 +2.0 -1.0 pb (< 6.1 pb at the 95% confidence level),
consistent with the standard model prediction of 5.1 pb.

study the interaction of gamma rays with a coherently vibrating periodic array

crystals illuminated by a strong driving optical laser field. We find that
deflection of the incident gamma beam into the Bragg angle can be switched on
and off by nuclear vibrations on a superradiant time scale determined by the
collective nuclear frequency, which is of the order of terahertz. Namely, if
the incident gamma wave is detuned from the nuclear transition by much larger
frequency it passes through the static nuclear array. However, if the nuclei
vibrate with the frequency of the gamma ray detuning then parametric resonance
can yield energy transfer into the Bragg deflected beam on the superradiant

eight Galactic HII regions. The temperatures derived from: a) recombination
lines of OII, and b) recombination lines of HI together with Balmer continua
are lower than those derived from forbidden lines, while the densities derived
from recombination lines of OII are similar or smaller than densities derived

These results imply that the proper abundances are those derived from

verification has become an essential part of the clinical treatment process.
The purpose of this work was to develop an electronic portal image (EPI) based
pre-treatment verification technique capable of quickly reconstructing 3D dose
distributions from both coplanar and non-coplanar treatments. The dose
reconstruction is performed in a spherical water phantom by modulating, based
on EPID measurements, pre-calculated Monte Carlo (MC) doselets defined on a
spherical coordinate system. This is called the spherical doselet modulation
(SDM) method. This technique essentially eliminates the statistical uncertainty
of the MC dose calculations by exploiting both azimuthal symmetry in a
patient-independent phase-space and symmetry of a virtual spherical water
phantom. The symmetry also allows the number of doselets necessary for dose
reconstruction to be reduced by a factor of about 250. In this work, 51
doselets were used. The SDM method mitigates the most computationally intensive
part of this type of dose reconstruction - reading, weighting and summing dose
matrices. The accuracy of the system was tested against MC calculations as well
as our previously reported phase-space modulation (PSM) method using a series
of open field and IMRT cases. The mean chi- and gamma-test 3% / 3 mm success
rates of the SDM method were 98.6% and 99.5%, respectively, when compared to
full MC simulation. The total calculation time was 96 seconds per treatment

based on a concept introduced by Lerallut et al. They achieve similar results
as the well-known geodesic active contour and self-snakes PDEs. In the present
work, the PDE approximated by amoeba active contours is derived for a general
geometric situation and general amoeba metric. This PDE is structurally similar
but not identical to the geodesic active contour equation. It reproduces the
previous PDE approximation results for amoeba median filters as special cases.
Furthermore, modifications of the basic amoeba active contour algorithm are
analysed that are related to the morphological force terms frequently used with
geodesic active contours. Experiments demonstrate the basic behaviour of amoeba
active contours and its similarity to geodesic active contours.

conditions are obtained for enforcing its convexity and for adjusting its

based on the modified conjugate gradient (MCG) and an alternating optimization
strategy are proposed. The proposed low-complexity algorithms can compute the
existing worst-case constrained minimum variance (WC-CMV) and the proposed
worst-case constrained constant modulus (WC-CCM) designs with a quadratic cost
in the number of parameters. Simulations show that the proposed WC-CCM
algorithm performs better than existing robust beamforming algorithms.
Moreover, the numerical results also show that the performances of the proposed

conjunction with the resonating-valence-bond (RVB) mechanism, it is simply the
RVB electron liquid; in one dimension, it is also the Tomonaga-Luttinger
liquid. The Kondo energy of the RVB liquid is $k_{\rm B}T_{\rm K} = O(|J|/D)$;
its effective Fermi energy is $O(k_{\rm B}T_{\rm K})$. A midband appears on the
chemical potential between the upper and lower Hubbard bands; the Hubbard gap
is a pseudogap. As regards the density of states per unit cell of the midband,
its bandwidth is $O(k_{\rm B}T_{\rm K})$ or $O(|J|/D)$, its peak height is
$O(1/U)$, and its spectral weight is $O[t^2/(DU^2)]$. Since the midband almost
disappears in the Heisenberg limit, the RVB electron liquid in the Heisenberg
limit is simply the RVB spin liquid. The RVB electron and spin liquids
adiabatically continue to each other. Since local moments form in a high-$T$

indistinguishable over most of their loci - a consequence of the settling out
of heavy elements in the dense white dwarf atmosphere and the near equality of
their masses. Lower quality data on M4 continues this trend to a third cluster
whose metallicity is intermediate between these two. While the path of the

highly skewed distribution of resources with no characteristic scale. Research
has long focused on why systems as varied as protein networks, evolution and
stock actions all feature scale independence. Assuming that they simply do, we
focus here on describing how this behaviour emerges, in contrast to more
idealized models usually considered. We arrive at the conjecture that a minimal
model to explain the growth towards scale independence involves only two
coupled dynamical features: the first is the well-known preferential attachment
principle and the second is a general form of delayed temporal scaling. While
the first is sufficient, the second is present in all studied data and appears
to maximize the speed of convergence to true scale independence. The delay in
this temporal scaling acts as a coupling between population growth and
individual activity. Together, these two dynamical properties appear to pave a
precise evolution path, such that even an instantaneous snapshot of a
distribution is enough to reconstruct the past of the system and predict its
future. We validate our approach and confirm its usefulness on diverse spheres
of human activities ranging from scientific and artistic productivity, to
sexual relations and online traffic.

of the real observed UDF12 galaxies at $z > 7$. As a result, we find that the
halo mass is almost linearly proportional to the observed ultraviolet (UV)
luminosity ($4 \times 10^{11}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ at $M_{\rm UV} = -21$). The dust
attenuation and UV slope $\beta$ well correlates with the observed UV
luminosity, which is consistent with observations quantitatively. The star
formation rate (SFR) is also linearly proportional to the stellar mass and the
specific SFR shows only a weak dependency on the mass. We also find an
increasing star formation history with a time-scale of $\sim100$ Myr in the
high-$z$ galaxies. An average metallicity weighted by the Lyman continuum
luminosity reaches up to $>0.1$ Solar even at $z \sim 10$, suggesting a rapid

interarm regions being defined based on a spatially filtered stellar component
model image, we measure the arm-to-interarm contrast for each band. The
contrast is lowest in the S11 image, which is interpreted as that among the
four AKARI MIR bands the S11 image best correlates with the spatial
distribution of dust grains including colder components, while the L24 image
with the highest contrast traces warmer dust heated by star forming activities.
The surface brightness ratio between the bands, i.e. color, is measured over
the disk of the main galaxy, M51a, at 300 pc resolution. We find that the
distribution of S7/S11 is smooth and well traces the global spiral arm pattern
while L15/S11 and L24/S11 peak at individual HII regions. This result indicates
that the ionization state of PAHs is related to the spiral structure.
Comparison with observational data and dust models also supports the importance
of the variation in the PAH ionization state within the M51a disk. However, the
mechanism driving this variation is not yet clear from currently available data
sets. Another suggestion from the comparison with the models is that the PAH
fraction to the total dust mass is higher than previously estimated.

Release 12. In principle, exploiting direct communication between nearby mobile
devices will improve spectrum utilization, overall throughput, and energy
consumption, while enabling new peer-to-peer and location-based applications
and services. D2D-enabled LTE devices can also become competitive for fallback
public safety networks, that must function when cellular networks are not
available, or fail. Introducing D2D poses many challenges and risks to the
long-standing cellular architecture, which is centered around the base station.
We provide an overview on D2D standardization activities in 3GPP, identify
outstanding technical challenges, draw lessons from initial evaluation studies,

state to a sudden local perturbation, a sort of orthogonality catastrophe
problem in a transient non-equilibrium environment. To this extent we consider,
as key quantity, the overlap between time dependent wave-functions, that we
write in terms of a novel two-time correlator generalizing the standard
Loschmidt Echo. We discuss its physical meaning, general properties, and its
connection with experimentally measurable quantities probed through
non-equilibrium Ramsey interferometry schemes. Then we present explicit
calculations for a one dimensional interacting Fermi system brought out of
equilibrium by a sudden change of the interaction, and perturbed by the
switching on of a local static potential. We show that different scattering
processes give rise to remarkably different behaviors at long times, quite
opposite from the equilibrium situation. In particular, while the forward
scattering contribution retains its power law structure even in the presence of
a large non-equilibrium perturbation, with an exponent that is strongly
affected by the transient nature of the bath, the backscattering term is a
source of non-linearity which generates an exponential decay in time of the
Loschmidt Echo, reminiscent of an effective thermal behavior.

maximum squashed entanglement that can be registered by a sender and receiver

inequality for the original squashed entanglement measure of Christandl and
Winter leads to the conclusion that the squashed entanglement of a quantum
channel is an additive function of a tensor product of any two quantum
channels. More importantly, this new subadditivity inequality, along with prior
results of Christandl, Winter, et al., establishes the squashed entanglement of
a quantum channel as an upper bound on the quantum communication capacity of
any channel assisted by unlimited forward and backward classical communication.
A similar proof establishes this quantity as an upper bound on the private
capacity of a quantum channel assisted by unlimited forward and backward public
classical communication. This latter result is relevant as a limitation on
rates achievable in quantum key distribution. As an important application, we
determine that these capacities can never exceed log((1+eta)/(1-eta)) for a
pure-loss bosonic channel for which a fraction eta of the input photons make it
to the output on average. The best known lower bound on these capacities is
equal to log(1/(1-eta)). Thus, in the high-loss regime for which eta << 1, this
new upper bound demonstrates that the protocols corresponding to the above
lower bound are nearly optimal.

the outflow behaviour as function of inflow around black holes with an equation
of state which allows flow to be thermally relativistic close to black holes
and non relativistic far away from black holes. We studied shock ejection
model. A pure electron positron pair flow never undergoes shock transition
while presence of some baryons (common in outflows and jets) makes it possible
to have standing shock waves in the flow. It can be concluded that the presence
of protons is necessary for the flow to show the outflow behaviour. The outflow
rate is maximum when the flow contains the proton number density which is 27%
of the electron number density. We conclude that a pure electron-positron jet

not, modern scientific findings rely on statistical analysis of

stability of statistical results relative to ""reasonable"" perturbations to data
and to the model used. Jacknife, bootstrap, and cross-validation are based on
perturbations to data, while robust statistics methods deal with perturbations
to models. In this article, a case is made for the importance of stability in
statistics. Firstly, we motivate the necessity of stability for interpretable
and reliable encoding models from brain fMRI signals. Secondly, we find strong
evidence in the literature to demonstrate the central role of stability in
statistical inference, such as sensitivity analysis and effect detection.
Thirdly, a smoothing parameter selector based on estimation stability (ES),
ES-CV, is proposed for Lasso, in order to bring stability to bear on
cross-validation (CV). ES-CV is then utilized in the encoding models to reduce
the number of predictors by 60% with almost no loss (1.3%) of prediction
performance across over 2,000 voxels. Last, a novel ""stability"" argument is
seen to drive new results that shed light on the intriguing interactions
between sample to sample variability and heavier tail error distribution (e.g.,
double-exponential) in high-dimensional regression models with $p$ predictors
and $n$ independent samples. In particular, when
$p/n\rightarrow\kappa\in(0.3,1)$ and the error distribution is
double-exponential, the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is a better estimator than

necessary to assume joint incoherence, which is a standard but unintuitive and
restrictive condition that is imposed by previous studies. This leads to a
sample complexity bound that is order-wise optimal with respect to the
incoherence parameter (as well as to the rank $r$ and the matrix dimension $n$
up to a log factor). As a consequence, we improve the sample complexity of
recovering a semidefinite matrix from $O(nr^{2}\log^{2}n)$ to $O(nr\log^{2}n)$,
and the highest allowable rank from $\Theta(\sqrt{n}/\log n)$ to
$\Theta(n/\log^{2}n)$. The key step in proof is to obtain new bounds on the
$\ell_{\infty,2}$-norm, defined as the maximum of the row and column norms of a
matrix. To illustrate the applicability of our techniques, we discuss
extensions to SVD projection, structured matrix completion and semi-supervised
clustering, for which we provide order-wise improvements over existing results.
Finally, we turn to the closely-related problem of low-rank-plus-sparse matrix
decomposition. We show that the joint incoherence condition is unavoidable here
for polynomial-time algorithms conditioned on the Planted Clique conjecture.
This means it is intractable in general to separate a rank-$\omega(\sqrt{n})$
positive semidefinite matrix and a sparse matrix. Interestingly, our results
show that the standard and joint incoherence conditions are associated
respectively with the information (statistical) and computational aspects of
the matrix decomposition problem.

planets can survive fast orbital migration. We determine numerically how the
average surface density inside the gap, sigma_gap, depends on planet-to-star

height-to-radius aspect ratio h/r. Our results are derived from our new

sigma_gap \propto q^-1 alpha^1.3 (h/r)^6.1. Surface density contrasts inside

dynamical plasma processes based on observations recorded by the Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The
prominence first goes through a slow rise (SR) phase followed by a fast rise
(FR). The slow rise phase started after a couple of small brightenings seen
toward the footpoints. At the turning point from SR to FR, the prominence had
already become kinked. The prominence shows strong brightening at the central
kink location during the start of FR. We interpret this as internal magnetic
reconnection occurring at a vertical current sheet forming between the two legs
of the erupting prominence (flux-rope). The brightening at the central kink
location is seen in all the EUV channels of AIA. The contributions of
differential emission at higher temperatures are larger compared to that for
typical coronal temperatures supporting a reconnection scenario at the central
kink location. The plasma above the brightening location gets ejected as a hot
plasmoid-like structure embedded in a CME, and those below drain down in the
form of blobs moving towards the Sun's surface. The unique time resolution of
the AIA has allowed all of these eruptive aspects, including SR-to-FR, kinking,
central current sheet formation, plasmoid-like eruption, and filament
""splitting"", to be observed in a single event, providing strong and
comprehensive evidence in favour of the model of partially erupting flux ropes.

evaluated by considering the anonymous communications patterns of 25 million

each user based on their most used phone tower or billing zip code. With this
information, spatial social networks are built at three levels of resolution:

address the question of whether spicules play an important role by injecting
plasma at cooler temperatures ($< 2$ MK), which then gets heated to coronal
values at higher altitudes. We measure red-blue asymmetries in line profiles
formed over a wide range of temperatures in the bright moss areas of two active
regions. We derive emission measure distributions from the excess wing
emission. We find that the asymmetries and emission measures are small and
conclude that spicules do not inject an important (dominant) mass flux into the
cores of active regions at temperatures $> 0.6$ MK ($\log T > 5.8$). These
conclusions apply not only to spicules, but to any process that suddenly heats
and accelerates chromospheric plasma (e.g., a chromospheric nanoflare). The
traditional picture of coronal heating and chromospheric evaporation appears to
remain the most likely explanation of the active region corona.

unavailable, morally unacceptable or might simply be at odds with the objective

paradigmatic problem of the area, we aim at solutions of maximum social welfare

  We focus on the design of incentive-compatible CAs without money in the
general setting of $k$-minded bidders. We trade monetary transfers with the
observation that the mechanism can detect certain lies of the bidders: i.e., we
study truthful CAs with verification and without money. We prove a
characterization of truthful mechanisms, which makes an interesting parallel
with the well-understood case of CAs with money for single-minded bidders. We
then give a host of upper bounds on the approximation ratio obtained by either
deterministic or randomized truthful mechanisms when the sets and valuations

polynomial time and return solutions with (nearly) best possible approximation
guarantees.) We complement these positive results with a number of lower bounds

an open driven-dissipative system. It includes external pumping of a thermal
reservoir, finite life time of the condensed particles and energy relaxation.
The coupling between the reservoir and the condensate is described with
semi-classical Boltzmann rates. This results in a dissipative term in the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation for the condensate, which is proportional to the
energy of the elementary excitations of the system. We analyse the main
properties of a condensate described by this hybrid Boltzmann Gross-Pitaevskii
model, namely, dispersion of the elementary excitations, bogolon distribution
function, first order coherence, dynamic and energetic stability, drag force
created by a disorder potential. We find that the dispersion of the elementary
excitations of a condensed state fulfils the Landau criterion of superfluidity.
The condensate is dynamically and energetically stable as longs it moves at a
velocity smaller than the speed of excitations. First order spatial coherence
of the condensate is found to decay exponentially in 1D and with a power law in
2D, similarly with the case of conservative systems. The coherence lengths are
found to be longer due to the finite life time of the condensate excitations.
We compare these properties with the ones of a condensate described by the
popular ""diffusive"" models in which the dissipative term is proportional to the
local condensate density. In the latter, the dispersion of excitations is
diffusive which as soon as the condensate is put into motion implies finite
mechanical friction and can lead to an energetic instability.

investigate the efficiency of this mechanism for values of the time-dependent

solutions to these equations of motion indicate that for the lifetime and

center of mass energy and that the effect is numerically very small. We note,

approaches to solve three-nucleon Faddeev equations are based on a partial-wave
decomposition. A rapid increase of the number of terms contributing to the
chiral three-nucleon force when increasing the order of the chiral expansion
from N2LO to N3LO forced us to develop a fast and effective method of
automatized partial wave decomposition. At low energies of the incoming nucleon
below about 20MeV, where only a limited number of partial waves is required,
this method allowed us to perform calculations of reactions in the
three-nucleon continuum using N3LO two- and three-nucleon forces. It turns out
that inclusion of consistent chiral interactions, with relativistic 1/m
corrections and short-range 2pi-contact term omitted in the N3LO three-nucleon
force, does not explain the long standing low energy Ay-puzzle. We discuss
problems arising when chiral forces are applied at higher energies, where large
three-nucleon force effects are expected. It seems plausible that at higher
energies, due to a rapid increase of a number of partial waves required to
reach convergent results, a three-dimensional formulation of the Faddeev
equations which avoids partial-wave decomposition is desirable.

quantification analysis of two time series of either a categorical or
continuous nature. Streams of behavioral information, from eye movements to
linguistic elements, unfold over time. When two people interact, such as in
conversation, they often adapt to each other, leading these behavioral levels
to exhibit recurrent states. In dialogue, for example, interlocutors adapt to
each other by exchanging interactive cues: smiles, nods, gestures, choice of
words, and so on. In order for us to capture closely the goings-on of dynamic
interaction, and uncover the extent of coupling between two individuals, we
need to quantify how much recurrence is taking place at these levels. Methods
available in crqa would allow researchers in cognitive science to pose such
questions as how much are two people recurrent at some level of analysis, what
is the characteristic lag time for one person to maximally match another, or
whether one person is leading another. First, we set the theoretical ground to
understand the difference between 'correlation' and 'co-visitation' when

an insulating bulk, and one should thus expect that the electronic transport in
these materials is dominated by the surfaces states. Alas, due to the high
remaining bulk conductivity, surface contributions to transport have so-far
only been singled out indirectly via quantum oscillations, or for devices based
on gated and doped topological insulator thin films, a situation in which the
surface carrier mobility could be limited by defect and interface scattering.
Here we present the first direct measurement of surface-dominated conduction on
an atomically clean surface of bulk-insulating Bi$_2$Te$_2$Se. Using nano-scale
four point setups with variable contact distance, we show that the transport at
30 K is two-dimensional rather than three-dimensional and by combining these

we find a surface state mobility of 390(30) cm$^{2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ at 30 K at

overhaul of a fully functional network is impractical, while at the same time,
the immediate benefits of SDN are obvious. A viable solution is thus a gradual
migration over time, where questions of which routers should migrate first, and
whether the order of migration makes a difference, can be analyzed from techno
economic and traffic engineering perspective. In this paper, we address these
questions from the techno economic perspective, and establish the importance of
migration scheduling. We propose optimization techniques and greedy algorithms
to plan an effective migration schedule, based on various techno economic
aspects, such as technological gains in combinations with CapEx limitations. We
demonstrate the importance of an effective migration sequence through two
relevant network management metrics, namely, number of alternative paths
availed by a node on migration, and network capacity savings. Our results
suggest that the sequence of migration plays a vital role, especially in the
early stages of network migration to SDN.

motivating the use of such machinery, explaining how recent experimental
results from the LHC and RHIC colliders suggests that the created QGP should be
described as a strongly coupled liquid with small but nonvanishing bulk and
shear viscosities. We argue that holographic dualities are a very efficient
framework for studying transport properties in such a medium.
  Next, we introduce the underlying physics behind all holographic dualities,
the AdS/CFT correspondence, and then motivate the necessity of implementing
conformal invariance breaking in them. After this, we present the
phenomenologically most successful holographic model of the strong interactions
- Improved Holographic QCD (IHQCD).
  Working within IHQCD, we next move on to calculate energy momentum tensor
correlators in the bulk and shear channels of large-Nc Yang-Mills theory. In
the shear channel, we confront our results with those derived in strongly
coupled N=4 Super Yang-Mills theory as well as weakly interacting ordinary
Yang-Mills theory. Close to the critical temperature of the deconfinement
transition, we observe significant effects of conformal invariance breaking. In
the bulk channel, where the conformal result is trivial, we make comparisons
with both perturbative and lattice QCD. We observe that lattice data seem to
favor our holographic prediction over the perturbative one over a wide range of

Galactic Bulge Survey X-ray sources. We report their accurate coordinates and
optical spectra acquired at the VLT and Magellan. All sources are classified as
accreting binaries according to their emission line characteristics. To
distinguish accreting binaries from chromospherically active objects we develop
and explain criteria based on Halpha and HeI 5786,6678 emission line properties
available in the literature. The spectroscopic properties and photometric
variability of all the objects are discussed and a classification of the source
is given where possible. Among the 23 systems, at least 9 of them show an
accretion-dominated optical spectrum (CX28, CX63, CX70, CX128, CX142, CX207,
CX522, CX794, CX1011) and another 6 show photospheric lines from a late-type
donor star in addition to accretion disc emission (CX44, CX93, CX137, CX154,
CX377 and CX1004) indicating that they are probably accreting binaries in
quiescence or in a low accretion rate state. Two sources are confirmed to be
eclipsing: CX207 and CX794. CX207 shows a broad asymmetric Halpha profile
blue-shifted by >300 km/s. Such line profile characteristics are consistent
with a magnetic (Polar) CV. CX794 is an eclipsing nova-like CV in the period
gap. Time-resolved photometry and the large broadening of the Halpha emission
lines in CX446 (2100 km/s FWHM) suggest that this is also an eclipsing or
high-inclination accreting binary. Finally, the low-accretion rate source
CX1004 shows a double-peaked Halpha profile with a FWHM of 2100 km/s. This
supports a high inclination or even eclipsing system. Whether the compact
object is a white dwarf in an eclipsing CV or a black hole primary in a
high-inclination LMXB remains to be established.

Many proposed applications require efficient transport of charge carriers
within these semiconducting monolayers. However, how to construct a stable
conducting nanoroad on these atomically thin semiconductors is still a
challenge. Here we demonstrate that hydrogenation on the surface of MoS2
monolayer induces a semiconductor-metal transition, and strip-patterned
hydrogenation is able to generate a conducting nanoroad. The band-gap closing
arises from the formation of in-gap hybridized states mainly consisting of Mo
4d orbitals, as well as the electron donation from hydrogen to the lattice
host. Ballistic conductance calculations reveal that such a nanoroad on the
MoS2 surface exhibits an integer conductance, indicating small carrier
scattering, and thus is ideal for serving as a conducting channel or
interconnect without compromising the mechanical and structural integrity of
the monolayer.

the promise of meeting the explosive growth of mobile data traffic. In this
architecture, all the baseband signal processing is shifted to a single
baseband unit (BBU) pool, which enables efficient resource allocation and
interference management. Meanwhile, conventional powerful base stations can be
replaced by low-cost low-power remote radio heads (RRHs), producing a green and
low-cost infrastructure. However, as all the RRHs need to be connected to the
BBU pool through optical transport links, the transport network power
consumption becomes significant. In this paper, we propose a new framework to
design a green Cloud-RAN, which is formulated as a joint RRH selection and
power minimization beamforming problem. To efficiently solve this problem, we
first propose a greedy selection algorithm, which is shown to provide near-
optimal performance. To further reduce the complexity, a novel group sparse
beamforming method is proposed by inducing the group-sparsity of beamformers
using the weighted $\ell_1/\ell_2$-norm minimization, where the group sparsity
pattern indicates those RRHs that can be switched off. Simulation results will
show that the proposed algorithms significantly reduce the network power
consumption and demonstrate the importance of considering the transport link
power consumption.

assessed visually through a histogram of the ranks of the observation's

radial separation Dp between galaxies correlates with the perturbation level P
of the pairs. Both parameters do not correlate with line-of-sight velocity
difference dV of galaxies. Dp and P are better measures of interaction strength
than dV. The latter correlates with the density of large-scale environment and
with the morphologies of galaxies. Both galaxies in a pair are of the same
nature, the only difference is that MRK galaxies are usually brighter than
their neighbors in average by 0.9 mag. Specific star formation rates (SSFR) of
galaxies in pairs with smaller Dp or dV is in average 0.5 dex higher than that
of galaxies in pairs with larger Dp or dV. Closeness of a neighbor with the
same and later morphological type increases the SSFR, while earlier-type
neighbors do not increase SSFR. Major interactions/mergers trigger SF and AGN
more effectively than minor ones. The fraction of AGNs is higher in more
perturbed pairs and pairs with smaller Dp. AGNs typically are in stronger
interacting systems than star-forming and passive galaxies. There are

$u_0$ which generates a global regular solution, does $u_{0, n}$ generate a

Physics signal can be expected mainly from the $W_R-W_R$ channel. An
interesting exception is the $W_L-W_R$ channel which can give a dominant
contribution to the process if the right-handed neutrino spectrum is
hierarchical with $M_1\lesssim$ MeV and $M_2,M_3\gtrsim$ GeV. We also discuss
if a New Physics signal in neutrinoless double beta decay experiments is
compatible with the existence of a successful Dark Matter candidate in the
left-right symmetric models. It turns out that, although it is not a generic
feature of the theory, it is still possible to accommodate such a signal with a
KeV sterile neutrino as Dark matter.

employed to examine a hypothesized link between solar activity and the Earth's
atmosphere, often through an investigation of Forbush decrease (Fd) events
(sudden high-magnitude decreases in the flux cosmic rays impinging on the
upper-atmosphere lasting up to several days). This technique is useful for
isolating low-amplitude signals within data where background variability would
otherwise obscure detection. The application of composite analyses to
investigate the possible impacts of Fd events involves a statistical
examination of time-dependent atmospheric responses to Fds often from aerosol
and/or cloud datasets. Despite the publication of numerous results within this
field, clear conclusions have yet to be drawn and much ambiguity and
disagreement still remain. In this paper, we argue that the conflicting
findings of composite studies within this field relate to methodological
differences in the manner in which the composites have been constructed and
analyzed. Working from an example, we show how a composite may be objectively
constructed to maximize signal detection, robustly identify statistical
significance, and quantify the lower-limit uncertainty related to hypothesis
testing. Additionally, we also demonstrate how a seemingly significant false
positive may be obtained from non-significant data by minor alterations to
methodological approaches.

(QSOs) is essential to understand the suspected coevolution of central
supermassive black holes (BHs) and their host galaxies. We selected a subsample
of the Hamburg/ESO survey for bright UV-excess QSOs, containing only the 99
nearest QSOs with redshift z<=0.06, that are close enough to allow detailed
structural analysis. From this ""low-luminosity type-1 QSO sample"", we observed
20 galaxies and performed aperture photometry and
bulge-disk-bar-AGN-decomposition with BUDDA on near-infrared J, H, K band
images. From the photometric decomposition of these 20 objects and visual
inspection of images of another 26, we find that ~50% of the hosts are disk
galaxies and most of them (86%) are barred. Stellar masses, calculated from
parametric models based on inactive galaxy colors, range from 2x10^9 M_sun to
2x10^11 M_sun. Black hole masses measured from single epoch spectroscopy range
from 1x10^6 M_sun to 5x10^8 M_sun. In comparison to higher luminosity QSO
samples, LLQSOs tend to have lower stellar and BH masses. Also, in the
effective radius vs. mean surface-brightness projection of the fundamental
plane, they lie in the transition area between luminous QSOs and ""normal""
galaxies. This can be seen as further evidence that they can be pictured as a
""bridge"" between the local Seyfert population and luminous QSOs at higher
redshift. Eleven low-luminosity QSOs for which we have reliable morphological
decompositions and BH mass estimations lie below the published BH mass vs.
bulge luminosity relations for inactive galaxies. This could be partially
explained by bulges of active galaxies containing much younger stellar
populations than bulges of inactive galaxies. Also, one could suspect that
their BHs are undermassive. This might hint at the growth of the host spheroid
to precede that of the BH.

inter-disciplinary scope of potential applications, ranging from nano-scale
science in condensed matter to the vast scales of astrophysical objects. The
theoretical description of quantum plasmas relies on various approaches,
microscopic or macroscopic, some of which have obvious relation to classical
plasma models. The appropriate model should, in principle, incorporate the
quantum mechanical effects such as diffraction, spin statistics and
correlations, operative on the relevant scales. However, first-principle
approaches such as quantum Monte Carlo and density functional theory or
quantum-statistical methods such as quantum kinetic theory or non-equilibrium
Green's functions require substantial theoretical and computational efforts.
Therefore, for selected problems, alternative simpler methods have been put
forward. In particular, the collective behavior of many-body systems is usually
described within a self-consistent scheme of particles and fields on the
mean-field level. In classical plasmas, further simplifications are achieved by
a transition to hydrodynamic equations. % Similar fluid-type descriptions for
quantum plasmas have been proposed and widely used in the recent decade. This
chapter is devoted to an overview of the main concepts of quantum hydrodynamics

limitations. Furthermore, the results of the linearized QHD in unmagnetized and
magnetized plasmas and a few nonlinear solutions are examined with
illustrations. The basic concepts and formulation of particle-particle

machine learning, both face the problem of deciding whether observed data is
compatible with a presumed causal relationship between the variables (for
example a local hidden variable model). Traditionally, Bell inequalities have
been used to describe the restrictions imposed by causal structures on marginal
distributions. However, some structures give rise to non-convex constraints on
the accessible data, and it has recently been noted that linear inequalities on
the observable entropies capture these situations more naturally. In this
paper, we show the versatility of the entropic approach by greatly expanding
the set of scenarios for which entropic constraints are known. For the first
time, we treat Bell scenarios involving multiple parties and multiple
observables per party. Going beyond the usual Bell setup, we exhibit
inequalities for scenarios with extra conditional independence assumptions, as
well as a limited amount of shared randomness between the parties. Many of our
results are based on a geometric observation: Bell polytopes for two-outcome
measurements can be naturally imbedded into the convex cone of attainable
marginal entropies. Thus, any entropic inequality can be translated into one
valid for probabilities. In some situations the converse also holds, which
provides us with a rich source of candidate entropic inequalities.

segmentation should provide the possibility to perform accurate classification

density and having the knowledge of changes in the breast density could give a
hint of a process which started to happen within a patient. Mammograms
generally suffer from a problem of different tissue overlapping which results
in the possibility of inaccurate detection of tissue types. Fibroglandular
tissue presents rather high attenuation of X-rays and is visible as brighter in
the resulting image but overlapping fibrous tissue and blood vessels could
easily be replaced with fibroglandular tissue in automatic segmentation
algorithms. Small blood vessels and microcalcifications are also shown as
bright objects with similar intensities as dense tissue but do have some
properties which makes possible to suppress them from the final results. In
this paper we try to divide dense and fat tissue by suppressing the scattered
structures which do not represent glandular or dense tissue in order to divide
mammograms more accurately in the two major tissue types. For suppressing blood
vessels and microcalcifications we have used Gabor filters of different size

holds in many cases, it should be possible to use the mean of local

our tests we use a publicly available color constancy image database for
testing. The results are presented and discussed and it turns out that the
proposed method outperforms many existing unsupervised color constancy

with optical flow for human action recognition. The STA descriptors are local
histogram-based descriptors of space-time, suitable for building a partial
representation of arbitrary spatio-temporal phenomena. Because of the
possibility of iterative refinement, they are interesting in the context of
online human action recognition. We investigate the use of dense optical flow
as the image function of the STA descriptor for human action recognition, using
two different algorithms for computing the flow: the Farneb\""ack algorithm and
the TVL1 algorithm. We provide a detailed analysis of the influencing optical
flow algorithm parameters on the produced optical flow fields. An extensive
experimental validation of optical flow-based STA descriptors in human action
recognition is performed on the KTH human action dataset. The encouraging
experimental results suggest the potential of our approach in online human
action recognition.

another one to account for within-class variations. The main idea behind this
approach is that road signs from different foreground variations can share
features that discriminate them from backgrounds. The classification function
training is accomplished using SVM, thus feature sharing is obtained through
support vector sharing. Training yields a family of linear detectors, where

the neural mechanisms of perception and action under inertial stimulations. In
these studies, uncontrolled simulator-introduced noise inevitably leads to a
mismatch between the reproduced motion and the trajectories meticulously
designed by the experimenter, possibly resulting in undesired motion cues to
the investigated system. An understanding of the simulator response to
different motion commands is therefore a crucial yet often underestimated step
towards the interpretation of experimental results. In this work, we developed
analysis methods based on signal processing techniques to quantify the noise in
the actual motion, and its deterministic and stochastic components. Our methods
allow comparisons between commanded and actual motion as well as between
different actual motion profiles. A specific practical example from one of our
studies is used to illustrate the methodologies and their relevance, but this
does not detract from its general applicability. Analyses of the simulator
inertial recordings show direction-dependent noise and nonlinearity related to
the command amplitude. The Signal-to-Noise Ratio is one order of magnitude
higher for the larger motion amplitudes we tested, compared to the smaller
motion amplitudes. Deterministic and stochastic noise components are of similar
magnitude for the weaker motions, whereas for stronger motions the
deterministic component dominates the stochastic component. The effect of
simulator noise on animal/human motion sensitivity is discussed. We conclude
that accurate analyses of a simulator motion are a crucial prerequisite for the
investigation of uncertainty in self-motion perception.

uncertain. They have an energy spectrum that extends from 1 GeV to beyond 1020
eV, where the rate is less than 1 particle per km2 per century. Shortly after
the discovery of the cosmic microwave background in 1965, it was pointed out
that the spectrum of cosmic rays should steepen fairly abruptly above about 4 x
1019 eV, provided the sources are distributed uniformly throughout the
Universe. This prediction, by Greisen and by Zatsepin and Kuzmin, has become
known as the GZK-effect and in this article I discuss the current position with
regard to experimental data on the energy spectrum of the highest cosmic-ray
energies that have been accumulated in a search that has lasted nearly 50
years. Although there is now little doubt that a suppression of the spectrum
exists near the energy predicted, it is by no means certain that this is a
manifestation of the GZK-effect as it might be that this energy is also close
to the maximum to which sources can accelerate particles, with the
highest-energy beam containing a large fraction of nuclei heavier than protons.

  actuators",,,,,"cond-mat.soft cond-mat.other","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the field of soft dielectric elastomers, the notion electrostriction
indicates the dependency of the permittivity on strain. The present paper is
aimed at investigating the effects of electrostriction onto the stability
behaviour of homogeneous electrically activated dielectric elastomer actuators.
In particular, three objectives are pursued and achieved: i) the description of
the phenomenon within the general nonlinear theory of electroelasticity; ii)
the application of the recently proposed theory of bifurcation for
electroelastic bodies in order to determine its role on the onset of
electromechanical and diffuse-mode instabilities in prestressed or prestretched
dielectric layers; iii) the analysis of band-localization instability in
homogeneous dielectric elastomers. Results for a typical soft acrylic elastomer
show that electrostriction is responsible for an enhancement towards
diffuse-mode instability, while it represents a crucial property - necessarily
to be taken into account - in order to provide a solution to the problem of
electromechanical band-localization, that can be interpreted as a possible
reason of electric breakdown. A comparison between the buckling stresses of a
mechanical compressed slab and the electrically activated counterpart concludes
the paper.

  The restriction to be imposed on the pairs of semi-skyline augmented fillings

inequality in the Bruhat order, w.r.t. the symmetric group, where one shape is
bounded by the reverse of the other. For semi-standard Young tableaux the
inequality means that the pair of their right keys is such that one key is

Lascoux expansion formula, when specialised to staircases or truncated

this new networking paradigm, we formulate the Constrained Virtual Steiner
Arborescence Problem (CVSAP) which asks for optimal locations to perform
In-network processing, in order to jointly minimize processing costs and
network traffic while respecting link and node capacities.
  We prove that CVSAP cannot be approximated (unless P = NP), and accordingly,
develop the exact algorithm VirtuCast to compute (near) optimal solutions.
VirtuCast consists of: (1) a compact single-commodity flow Integer Programming
(IP) formulation; (2) a flow decomposition algorithm to reconstruct individual
routes from the IP solution. The compactness of the IP formulation allows for
computing lower bounds even on large instances quickly, speeding up the
algorithm. We rigorously prove VirtuCast's correctness.
  To complement our theoretical findings, we have implemented VirtuCast and
present an extensive computational evaluation, showing that using VirtuCast
realistically sized instances can be solved (close to) optimality. We show that
VirtuCast significantly improves upon naive multi-commodity formulations and
also initiate the study of primal heuristics to generate feasible solutions
during the branch-and-bound process.

on fixed eccentric orbits embedded in protoplanetary discs. The aim of this
study is to determine how the strength of the sustained, non-linear corotation
torque experienced by embedded planets varies as a function of orbital
eccentricity, disc parameters, and planetary mass. In agreement with previous
work we find that the corotation torque diminishes as orbital eccentricity,
$e$, increases. Analysis of the time-averaged streamlines in the disc
demonstrates that the width of the horseshoe region narrows as the eccentricity
increases, and we suggest that this narrowing largely explains the observed
decrease in the corotation torque. We employ three distinct methods for
estimating the strength of the unsaturated corotation torque from our
simulations, and provide an empirical fit to these results. We find that a
simple model where the corotation torque, $\Gamma_C$, decreases exponentially
with increasing eccentricity (i.e. $\Gamma_C \propto \exp{(-e/e_f)}$) provides
a good global fit to the data with an e-folding eccentricity, $e_f$, that
scales linearly with the disc scale height at the planet location. We confirm
that this model provides a good fit for planet masses of 5 and 10 $\Me$ in our
simulations. The formation of planetary systems is likely to involve
significant planet-planet interactions that will excite eccentric orbits, and
this is likely to influence disc-driven planetary migration through
modification of the corotation torque. Our results suggest that high fidelity
models of planetary formation should account for these effects.

and soft neutralinos, are usually dubbed ""stealth stops"". Their kinematics
looks very similar to that of the standard tops events, which leads to events
with little or no excess of missing transverse energy. This complicates the
probing of this region of the stop parameter space by hadron colliders,
rendering the application of standard searching techniques challenging. In this
Snowmass white paper we reanalyze the spin correlation approach to the search
of stealth stops, focusing on the feasibility of this search at the 14 TeV LHC.
We find, while the statistical limitations significantly shrink compared to the
low-luminosity 8 TeV run, the systematic PDF uncertainties pose the main
obstacle. We show that the current understanding of PDFs probably does not
allow us to talk about top and stop discrimination via spin correlation in the
inclusive sample. On the other hand the systematic uncertainties significantly
shrink if only events with low center of mass energy are considered, rendering
the search in this region feasible.

width of the Higgs boson and monojet search at the LHC. It is shown that if the
invisible decay of the standard model Higgs boson is open, LHC as well as
direct detection experiments like LUX and XENON100 could put stringent limits
on the Higgs boson couplings to dark matter. We find that the most favoured
parameter space for IHDM corresponds to dark matter with a mass less than 100
GeV or so. In particular, the best-fit points are at the dark matter mass
around 70 GeV where the invisible Higgs decay to dark matter is closed. Scalar
dark matter in the higher mass range of 0.5-4 TeV is also explored in our
study. Projected sensitivities for the future experiments of monojet at LHC-14,
XENON1T and AMS-02 one year antiproton flux are shown to put further
constraints on the existing parameter space of IHDM.

others, we also consider a model of non-commutative quantum mechanics, and we
show that this model too can be described in terms of $\cal D$ pseudo-bosons.

Boulware-Deser ghost may only be avoided if the derivative structure of the
theory is not tuned to be Einsteinian.

investigated. Measurements are performed introducing deformable elastic objets
in the films. The shape adopted by those objects set in the film can be related
to the surface tension value at a given vertical position by numerical solving
of adapted elasticity equations. We show that the observed dependency of the
surface tension versus the vertical position in the soap film can be reproduced
by simple modeling taking into account film thickness measurements.

the universe expansion is thought to be accelerating up. This change of the
belief is motivated by the observed brightness of the high redshift supernova
Ia fainter than expected. In this paper it is argued that this change of the
belief is not necessary. There is a more reasonable explanation for the
observed brightness of the supernovae Ia fainter than expected. That is: the
universe space filled with the tenuous ionized gas; the Thomson Effect of free
electron in the ionized gas caused the observed brightness of the high redshift
supernova Ia fainter than expected. The observations of Warm-Hot Intergalactic
Medium (WHIM) support this explanation. The universe space filled with tenuous
ionized gas explanation will lead to the puzzle of the dark matter and dark
energy disappeared simultaneously

by adding fermionic Lorentz scalar variables, characterising attribute, or
property, to space-time location. [With five such properties one can
accommodate all known leptons and quarks.] Using just one property, viz.
electricity, the general relativity of such a scheme and its superscalar
curvature automatically produces the Einstein-Maxwell Lagrangian and a
cosmological term. By adding more properties we envisage the geometrical
unification of the standard model with gravitation.

counting function pi(x). The result follows from subdividing the natural
numbers into the intervals s_k :={p_k^2,..., p_{k+1}^2-1}, k>=1, each being
fully sieved by the k first primes {p_1,..., p_k}. Denoting the number of
primes in s_k by pi_k, we show that pi_k |s_k|/log p_{k+1}^2 and that pi(x)
li(x) originates as a continuum approximation of the sum sum_k pi_k. In
contrast, pi(x) x/log x stems from sieving repeatedly in regions already
completed---explaining why x/log x underestimates pi(x). The explanatory
potential arising from defining s_k appears promising, evidenced in the last
section where we outline further research.

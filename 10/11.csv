radio, and X-ray point of view. We present deep Very Large Array observations
in total intensity at 325 and 1400 MHz. We produced and analyzed spectral index

and looked for possible correlations with the thermal properties of the
cluster. We find an integrated radio halo spectral index alpha(325-1400) ~
1.12. No strong radial steepening is present and the spectral index
distribution is intrinsically complex with fluctuations only partially due to
measurement errors. The radio halo integrated spectral index and the cluster
temperature follow the global trend observed in other galaxy clusters although
a strong point-to-point correlation between the spectral index and the thermal
gas temperature has not been observed. The complex morphology in the spectral
index image of the radio halo in A520 is in agreement with the primary models
for radio halo formation. The flatness of the radial profile suggests that the

gravitational wave metric perturbations, which are gauge-dependent and ---
correspondingly --- unphysical quantities. This is particularly true for
ground-based interferometric detectors, like LIGO, space-based detectors, like
LISA and its derivatives, spacecraft doppler tracking detectors, and pulsar
timing arrays detectors. The description of gravitational waves, and a
gravitational wave detector's response, to the unphysical metric perturbation
has lead to a proliferation of false analogies and descriptions regarding how
these detectors function, and true misunderstandings of the physical character
of gravitational waves.
  Here we provide a fully physical and gauge invariant description of the
response of a wide class of gravitational wave detectors in terms of the
Riemann curvature, the physical quantity that describes gravitational phenomena
in general relativity. In the limit of high frequency gravitational waves, the
Riemann curvature separates into two independent gauge invariant quantities: a
""background"" curvature contribution and a ""wave"" curvature contribution. In
this limit the gravitational wave contribution to the detector response reduces
to an integral of the gravitational wave contribution of the curvature along
the unperturbed photon path between components of the detector. The description
presented here provides an unambiguous physical description of what a
gravitational wave detector measures and how it operates, a simple means of
computing corrections to a detectors response owing to general detector motion,
a straightforward way of connecting the results of numerical relativity
simulations to gravitational wave detection, and a basis for a general and
fully relativistic pulsar timing formula.

CPN based algorithm can explore optimal routes rapidly and adaptively in a
highly dynamic emergency environment with low expense. Simultaneously, in
emergency situations there are typically different categories of evacuees such
as people of different age groups. However, current algorithms only consider
""normal"" evacuees and do not meet the specific requirements of diverse

with different user-defined goals to customize appropriate paths for each
category. The CPN algorithm is simulated in a graph based discrete-event

results show that the CPN algorithm reaches the performance of ideal

inefficient conditional simulation of the latent variables. To accomplish this
task efficiently, a new transdimensional Monte Carlo sampler is developed for
approximate Bayesian model inference and used to estimate rates of introduction
and spread for the non-native earthworm species Dendrobaena octaedra (Savigny)
along roads in the boreal forest of northern Alberta. Using low and high
estimates of introduction and spread rates, the extent of earthworm invasions
in northeastern Alberta was simulated to project the proportion of suitable
habitat invaded in the year following data collection.

$e^+e^- \to \gamma \, D^{(*)} \bar D^{(*)}$, and similar reactions with
$B^{(*)}$ mesons. The ratio $R^{c/n}$ of the yield of pairs of charged mesons
to that of neutral mesons near the threshold for the heavy pair is strongly
affected by the isospin breaking due to the isotopic mass differences and due
to the Coulomb interaction between the charged mesons. The actual behavior of
the isospin breaking in $R^{c/n}$ is also sensitive to the strong interaction
between the heavy mesons, so that experimental measurement of this ratio can be
used as a probe of this strong interaction. We calculate $R^{c/n}$ at and very
near the threshold in terms of the isotopic scattering lengths for the meson
pairs. In particular we find that the yield of pairs of charged mesons does not
go to zero at exactly the threshold, but rather starts with a finite step,
whose height depends on the value of the scattering length in a particular

mistake was crucial for Einstein's pathway to the first version of the 1915
general theory of relativity, but also might have played a role in obtaining
the final version of Einstein's 1915 field equations. In 1914 Einstein wrote
the equations for conservation of energy-momentum for matter, and established a
connection between these equations and the components of the gravitational
field. He showed that a material point in gravitational fields moves on a
geodesic line in space-time, the equation of which is written in terms of the
Christoffel symbols. By November 4, 1915, Einstein found it advantageous to use
for the components of the gravitational field, not the previous equation, but
the Christoffel symbols. He corrected the 1914 equations of conservation of
energy-momentum for matter. Einstein had already basically possessed the field
equations in 1912 together with his mathematician friend Marcel Grossman, but
because he had not recognized the formal importance of the Christoffel symbols
as the components of the gravitational field, he could ""not obtain a clear
overview"". Finally, considering the energy-momentum conservation equations for
matter, an important similarity between equations suggests that, this equation
could have assisted Einstein in obtaining the final form of the field equations
(the November 25, 1915 ones) that were generally covariant.

first part of a comprehensive analysis framework designed to maximize the

analytic calculation of the leading order fully differential cross sections for
the golden channel signal and background to include the 4e and $4\mu$ final

relative fractions of the different possible combinations of scalar-tensor

kinematic variables as well as show various doubly differential spectra for
both the signal and background. From these analytic expressions we then
construct a `generator level' analysis framework based on the maximum

multi-parameter extractions of all the possible effective couplings of a spin-0
scalar to pairs of neutral electroweak gauge bosons including any correlations.
This framework provides a powerful method for study of these couplings and can
be readily adapted to include the relevant detector and systematic effects

GeV per nucleon have been shown to be very useful for investigating the

on transport theory. In particular, the elliptic flow in collisions of
neutron-rich heavy-ion systems emerges as an observable sensitive to the
strength of the symmetry energy at supra-saturation densities. The comparison
of ratios or differences of neutron and proton flows or neutron and hydrogen
flows with predictions of transport models favors an approximately linear
density dependence, consistent with ab-initio nuclear-matter theories.
Extensive parameter searches have shown that the model dependence is comparable
to the uncertainties of existing experimental data. Comprehensive new flow data
of high accuracy, partly also through providing stronger constraints on model
parameters, can thus be expected to improve our knowledge of the equation of

connected along <110> vectors into a Koch-Cohen-like arrangement, with the
majority of octahedral vacancies concentrated near these defects. Bond valence
calculations indicate a change in the charge distribution on the cations with
the charge on the tetrahedral interstitials increasing on cooling. The magnetic
structure is more complex than previously thought, corresponding to a
non-collinear spin arrangement described by a superposition of a condensed spin
wave on the established type-II antiferromagnetic ordering. This leads to an
architecture with four groups of cations each with different spin directions.
The cations within the interstitial clusters appear to be weakly
ferromagnetically coupled and their spins are correlated to the spins of the
octahedral cations closest to them. This work not only provides further insight
into the local structure of wustite but also a better understanding of the
coupling between defect structures and magnetic and charge-ordering in complex

{\lambda}-extendible properties of graphs as a generalization of the property
of being bipartite. They showed that for any 0 < {\lambda} < 1 and
{\lambda}-extendible property {\Pi}, any connected graph G on n vertices and m
edges contains a spanning subgraph H in {\Pi} with at least {\lambda}m +
(1-{\lambda})(n-1)/2 edges. The property of being bipartite is
{\lambda}-extendible for {\lambda} = 1/2, and so the Poljak-Turzik bound
generalizes the well-known Edwards-Erdos bound for Max-Cut. Other examples of
{\lambda}-extendible properties include: being an acyclic oriented graph, a
balanced signed graph, or a q-colorable graph for some integer q.
  Mnich et. al. (FSTTCS 2012) defined the closely related notion of strong
{\lambda}-extendibility. They showed that the problem of finding a subgraph
satisfying a given strongly {\lambda}-extendible property {\Pi} is
fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) when parameterized above the Poljak-Turzik
bound - does there exist a spanning subgraph H of a connected graph G such that
H in {\Pi} and H has at least {\lambda}m + (1-{\lambda})(n-1)/2 + k edges? -
subject to the condition that the problem is FPT on a certain simple class of
graphs called almost-forests of cliques.
  In this paper we settle the kernelization complexity of nearly all problems
parameterized above Poljak-Turzik bounds, in the affirmative. We show that
these problems admit quadratic kernels (cubic when {\lambda} = 1/2), without
using the assumption that the problem is FPT on almost-forests of cliques. Thus
our results not only remove the technical condition of being FPT on
almost-forests of cliques from previous results, but also unify and extend
previously known kernelization results in this direction. Our results add to
the select list of generic kernelization results known in the literature.

geometric phase (GP) appears in the nuclear and electronic wave-functions in
the adiabatic representation. We study GP effects in nuclear dynamics of an
N-dimensional linear vibronic coupling (LVC) model. The main impact of GP on
low-energy nuclear dynamics is reduction of population transfer between the
local minima of the LVC lower energy surface. For the LVC model, we proposed an
isometric coordinate transformation that confines non-adiabatic effects within
a two-dimensional subsystem interacting with an N-2 dimensional environment.
Since environmental modes do not couple electronic states, all GP effects
originate from nuclear dynamics within the subsystem. We explored when the GP
affects nuclear dynamics of the isolated subsystem, and how the
subsystem-environment interaction can interfere with GP effects. Comparing

and probabilistic choices. After fixing a strategy, an MDP produces a sequence
of probability distributions over states. The sequence is eventually
synchronizing if the probability mass accumulates in a single state, possibly
in the limit. Precisely, for 0 <= p <= 1 the sequence is p-synchronizing if a
probability distribution in the sequence assigns probability at least p to some
state, and we distinguish three synchronization modes: (i) sure winning if
there exists a strategy that produces a 1-synchronizing sequence; (ii)
almost-sure winning if there exists a strategy that produces a sequence that
is, for all epsilon > 0, a (1-epsilon)-synchronizing sequence; (iii) limit-sure
winning if for all epsilon > 0, there exists a strategy that produces a

characterizations that give a PSPACE complexity for the decision problems, and
we establish matching PSPACE lower bounds; (b) we show that for sure winning
strategies, exponential memory is sufficient and may be necessary, and that in
general infinite memory is necessary for almost-sure winning, and unbounded
memory is necessary for limit-sure winning; (c) along with our results, we
establish new complexity results for alternating finite automata over a

stars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to estimate the total extinction
of the Milky Way at the high Galactic latitudes, $R_V$ and $A_V$ in each line

values in the given lines of sight. Based on the most likely values of
reddening in multiple colors, we were able to derive the values of $R_V$ and
$A_V$.
  Results: We selected 94 zero-reddened BHB stars from seven globular clusters
as the template. The reddening in the four SDSS colors for the northern
Galactic cap were estimated by comparing the field BHB stars with the template
stars. The accuracy of this estimation is around 0.01\,mag for most lines of
sight. We also obtained $<R_V>$ to be around 2.40$\pm1.05$ and $A_V$ map within
an uncertainty of 0.1\,mag. The results, including reddening values in the four
SDSS colors, $A_V$, and $R_V$ in each line of sight, are released on line. In
this work, we employ an up-to-date parallel technique on GPU card to overcome
time-consuming computations. We plan to release online the C++ CUDA code used
for this analysis.
  Conclusions: The extinction map derived from BHB stars is highly consistent
with that from Schlegel, Finkbeiner & Davis(1998). The derived $R_V$ is around
2.40$\pm1.05$. The contamination probably makes the $R_V$ be larger.

currently limited by small number statistics, widely varying selection
techniques and assumptions, we have performed a systematic study of cluster
formation utilizing cosmological simulations. We use the Millennium Simulations
to track the evolution of dark matter and galaxies in ~3,000 clusters from the
earliest times to z=0. We define an effective radius R_e for proto-clusters and
characterize their growth in size and mass. We show that the progenitor regions
of galaxy clusters (M>10^14 M_sun/h) can already be identified at least up to
z~5, provided that the galaxy overdensities, delta_gal, are measured on a
sufficiently large scale (R_e~5-10 cMpc). We present the overdensities in
matter, DM halos, and galaxies as functions of present-day cluster mass,
redshift, bias, and window size that can be used to interpret the structures
found in real surveys. We derive the probability that a structure having a
delta_gal, defined by a set of observational selection criteria, is indeed a
proto-cluster, and show how their z=0 masses can already be estimated long
before virialization. Galaxy overdensity profiles as a function of radius are
presented. We further show how their projected surface overdensities decrease
as the uncertainties in redshift measurements increase. We provide a table of
proto-cluster candidates selected from the literature, and discuss their
properties in the light of our simulations predictions. This work provides the
general framework that will allow us to extend the study of cluster formation
out to much higher redshifts using the large number of proto-clusters that are

beings residing in the higher dimensional flat space(time) may set up sources
to fool the observer confined on the lower dimensional curved submanifold that
she is detecting the field generated by a space(time) point source in her own

We then employ it to derive the Green's function of the massive wave operator

differential operator -- the Laplacian plus a ""mass term"" -- on the (d >=

as that of the massless case, while the required scalar charge densities are
determined by solving an eigenvalue equation. To source these massive Green's
functions, we show that the (d+1)-dimensional Minkowski/Euclidean
experimentalists may choose to use either massive or massless scalar line
charges. In de Sitter spacetime, the embedding method employed here leads
directly to a manifest separation between the null cone versus tail terms of
the Green's functions.

across which the CNM undergoes thermal expansion, is linearly unstable to
corrugational disturbances, in complete analogy with the Darrieus-Landau
instability (DLI) of terrestrial flames. We perform a full linear stability
analysis as well as nonlinear hydrodynamic simulations of the DLI of such
evaporation fronts in the presence of thermal conduction. We find that the DLI
is suppressed at short length scales by conduction. The length and time scales
of the fastest growing mode are inversely proportional to the evaporation flow
speed of the CNM and its square, respectively. In the nonlinear stage, the DLI
saturates to a steady state where the front deforms to a finger-like shape
protruding toward the WNM, without generating turbulence. The evaporation rate
at nonlinear saturation is larger than the initial plane-parallel value by a
factor of 2.4 when the equilibrium thermal pressure is 1800 k_B cm^-3 K. The
degrees of front deformation and evaporation-rate enhancement at nonlinear
saturation are determined primarily by the density ratio between the CNM and
WNM. We demonstrate that the Field length in the thermally unstable medium

outcomes involving thermal instability.

(strong) bar fraction of $23.6\pm 0.4\%$, of which 1,154 barred galaxies also
have bar length measurements. These samples are the largest ever used to study
the role of bars in galaxy evolution. We find that the likelihood of a galaxy
hosting a bar is anti-correlated with SSFR, regardless of stellar mass or bulge
prominence. We find that the trends of bar likelihood and bar length with bulge
prominence are bimodal with SSFR. We interpret these observations using
state-of-the-art simulations of bar evolution which include live halos and the
effects of gas and star formation. We suggest our observed trends of bar
likelihood with SSFR are driven by the gas fraction of the disks; a factor
demonstrated to significantly retard both bar formation and evolution in
models. We interpret the bimodal relationship between bulge prominence and bar
properties as due to the complicated effects of classical bulges and central
mass concentrations on bar evolution, and also to the growth of disky
pseudobulges by bar evolution. These results represent empirical evidence for
secular evolution driven by bars in disk galaxies. This work suggests that bars
are not stagnant structures within disk galaxies, but are a critical
evolutionary driver of their host galaxies in the local universe ($z<1$).

acceleration operates for quasi-parallel configurations (i.e., when the
background magnetic field is almost aligned with the shock normal) and, for
large sonic and Alfv\'enic Mach numbers, produces universal power-law spectra
proportional to p^(-4), where p is the particle momentum. The maximum energy of
accelerated ions increases with time, and it is only limited by finite box size
and run time. Acceleration is mainly efficient for parallel and quasi-parallel
strong shocks, where 10-20% of the bulk kinetic energy can be converted to
energetic particles, and becomes ineffective for quasi-perpendicular shocks.
Also, the generation of magnetic turbulence correlates with efficient ion
acceleration, and vanishes for quasi-perpendicular configurations. At very
oblique shocks, ions can be accelerated via shock drift acceleration, but they
only gain a factor of a few in momentum, and their maximum energy does not
increase with time. These findings are consistent with the degree of
polarization and the morphology of the radio and X-ray synchrotron emission
observed, for instance, in the remnant of SN 1006. We also discuss the
transition from thermal to non-thermal particles in the ion spectrum
(supra-thermal region), and we identify two dynamical signatures peculiar of
efficient particle acceleration, namely the formation of an upstream precursor
and the alteration of standard shock jump conditions.

exacerbated by the uneven sampling of the light curve imposed by the orbital
phasing of HST's observations. Our final transit spectra for all three objects
are consistent with the presence of a broad absorption feature at 1.4 microns
potentially due to water. However, the amplitude of the absorption is less than
that expected based on previous observations with Spitzer, possibly due to
hazes absorbing in the NIR or non-solar compositions. The degeneracy of models
with different compositions and temperature structures combined with the low
amplitude of any features in the data preclude our ability to place unambiguous

longest standing mysteries in nuclear astrophysics. Core collapse supernovae

evidence yet exists for their in situ formation in such environments. Motivated
by the advent of sensitive new or planned X-ray telescopes such as the Nuclear
Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) and the Large Observatory for X-ray
Timing (LOFT), we revisit the prospects for the detection of X-ray decay lines
from r-process nuclei in young or nearby supernova remnants. For all remnants
planned to be observed by NuSTAR (and several others), we conclude that
r-process nuclei are detectable only if the remnant possesses a large
overabundance O > 1e3 relative to the average yield per SN. Prospects are
better for the next Galactic SN (assumed age of 3 years and distance of 10
kpc), for which an average r-process yield is detectable via the 10.7(9.2) keV
line complexes of Os194 by LOFT at 6 sigma (5 sigma) confidence; the 27.3 keV
line complex of Sb125 is detectable by NuSTAR at 2 sigma for O > 2. We also
consider X-rays lines from the remnants of Galactic magnetars, motivated by the
much higher r-process yields of the magneto-rotationally driven SNe predicted
to birth magnetars. The ~ 3.6-3.9 keV lines of Sn126 are potentially detectable
in the remnants of the magnetars 1E1547.0-5408 and 1E2259+586 by LOFT for an
assumed r-process yield predicted by recent simulations. The (non-)detection of
these lines can thus probe whether magnetars are indeed born with millisecond
periods. Finally, we consider a blind survey of the Galactic plane with LOFT
for r-process lines from the most recent binary neutron star merger remnant,
concluding that a detection is unlikely without additional information on the
merger location.

transverse, structure functions for both solenoidal and compressional
components, in the cluster core, virial region and beyond. The structure
functions exhibit a well defined inertial range. The injection scale is
comparable to the virial radius but increases towards the outskirts. Within
\rvir/3, the spectral slope of the solenoidal component is close to
Kolmogorov's, but for the compressional component is substantially steeper and
close to Burgers'; the flow is mostly solenoidal and statistically rigorously
consistent with fully developed, homogeneous and isotropic turbulence. Small
scale anisotropy appears due to numerical artifact. Towards the virial region,
the flow becomes compressional, the structure functions flatter and modest
genuine anisotropy appear. In comparison, mesh adaptivity based on Lagrangian

transient and recurrent spiral structure, whose co-rotating nature gives rise
to changes in the angular momentum (radial migration) of star particles close
to the spiral arm at many radii. From high resolution N-body simulations, we
highlight the evolution of strongly migrating star particles (migrators) and
star particles that do not migrate (non-migrators) around a spiral arm. We
investigate the individual orbit histories of migrators and non-migrators and
find that there are several types of migrator and non-migrator, each with
unique radial evolution. We contrast each type of orbit to establish the
reasons for the differences between them. We find that the positive (negative)
migrators sustain a position behind (in front of) the spiral arm, and feel
continuous tangential force as long as the spiral arm persists. On the other
hand, non-migrators stay close to the spiral arm, and pass or are passed by the
spiral arm one or two times. Although they gain or lose the angular momentum
when they are behind or in front of the spiral arm, their net angular momentum
change becomes close to zero. We discuss also the long term effects of radial
migration on the radial metallicity distribution and radial angular momentum

slowly through gas accretion. The gas accretion must have been at low
metallicity in order to reconcile the metallicities observed in the disc with
the predictions of chemical evolution models. But how does this gas accretion
take place? I review the current evidence of gas accretion into the Milky Way
and similar galaxies through the infall of cold gas clouds and satellites. The
conclusion from these studies is that the infalling gas at high column
densities observed in HI emission is a least one order of magnitude below the
value required to sustain star formation, thus accretion must come from a
different channel. The likely reservoir for gas accretion is the cosmological
corona of virial-temperature gas in which every galaxy must be embedded. At the
interface between the disc and the corona the cold high-metallicity disc gas
and the hot coronal medium must mix efficiently and this mix- ing causes the
cooling and accretion of the lower corona. I show how this mechanism reproduces
the kinematics of the neutral extraplanar gas in the Milky Way and other nearby
galaxies and the ionised high-velocity clouds observed in HST spectra. I
conclude with the speculation that the loss in efficiency of the disc-corona
interaction is the ultimate cause for the evolution of disc galaxies towards

used in a large number of applications. These methods classify initially
unlabeled nodes by propagating label information over the structure of graph
starting from seed nodes. Graph-based SSL algorithms usually scale linearly
with the number of distinct labels (m), and require O(m) space on each node.
Unfortunately, there exist many applications of practical significance with
very large m over large graphs, demanding better space and time complexity. In
this paper, we propose MAD-SKETCH, a novel graph-based SSL algorithm which
compactly stores label distribution on each node using Count-min Sketch, a
randomized data structure. We present theoretical analysis showing that under
mild conditions, MAD-SKETCH can reduce space complexity at each node from O(m)
to O(log m), and achieve similar savings in time complexity as well. We support
our analysis through experiments on multiple real world datasets. We observe
that MAD-SKETCH achieves similar performance as existing state-of-the-art
graph- based SSL algorithms, while requiring smaller memory footprint and at
the same time achieving up to 10x speedup. We find that MAD-SKETCH is able to
scale to datasets with one million labels, which is beyond the scope of
existing graph- based SSL algorithms.

contributor to traffic congestion and air pollution causing substantial adverse
effects on human health. Sharing taxi trips is a possible way of reducing the
negative impact of taxi services on cities, but this comes at the expense of
passenger discomfort quantifiable in terms of a longer travel time. Due to
computational challenges, taxi sharing has traditionally been approached on
small scales, such as within airport perimeters, or with dynamical ad-hoc
heuristics. However, a mathematical framework for the systematic understanding
of the tradeoff between collective benefits of sharing and individual passenger
discomfort is lacking. Here we introduce the notion of shareability network
which allows us to model the collective benefits of sharing as a function of
passenger inconvenience, and to efficiently compute optimal sharing strategies
on massive datasets. We apply this framework to a dataset of millions of taxi
trips taken in New York City, showing that with increasing but still relatively
low passenger discomfort, cumulative trip length can be cut by 40% or more.
This benefit comes with reductions in service cost, emissions, and with split
fares, hinting towards a wide passenger acceptance of such a shared service.
Simulation of a realistic online system demonstrates the feasibility of a
shareable taxi service in New York City. Shareability as a function of trip
density saturates fast, suggesting effectiveness of the taxi sharing system
also in cities with much sparser taxi fleets or when willingness to share is
low.

the inclined F ring unevenly blocked the east and west ansae of the main rings.
The brightness asymmetry produced by the model is highly sensitive to the
vertical thickness and radial optical depth of the F ring. The F ring model
that best matches the observations has a vertical full width at half maximum of
13 +/- 7 km and an equivalent depth of 10 +/- 4 km. The model also reproduces

of questions in evolutionary biology, such as those that elucidate historical
biogeography or uncover patterns of coevolution and diversification. Because
molecular sequence data are not informative on absolute time, external data,
most commonly fossil age estimates, are required to calibrate estimates of
species divergence dates. For Bayesian divergence-time methods, the common
practice for calibration using fossil information involves placing arbitrarily
chosen parametric distributions on internal nodes, often disregarding most of
the information in the fossil record. We introduce the 'fossilized birth-death'
(FBD) process, a model for calibrating divergence-time estimates in a Bayesian
framework, explicitly acknowledging that extant species and fossils are part of
the same macroevolutionary process. Under this model, absolute node age
estimates are calibrated by a single diversification model and arbitrary
calibration densities are not necessary. Moreover, the FBD model allows for
inclusion of all available fossils. We performed analyses of simulated data and
show that node-age estimation under the FBD model results in robust and
accurate estimates of species divergence times with realistic measures of
statistical uncertainty, overcoming major limitations of standard divergence
time estimation methods. We then used this model to estimate the speciation
times for a dataset composed of all living bears, indicating that the genus

seismic hazard estimates and Coulomb stress and other models of earthquake
occurrence. Here we report on a high-resolution global forecast of earthquake
rate density as a function of location, magnitude, and focal mechanism. In
previous publications we reported forecasts of 0.5 degree spatial resolution,
covering the latitude range magnitude, and focal mechanism. In previous
publications we reported forecasts of 0.5 degree spatial resolution, covering
the latitude range from -75 to +75 degrees, based on the Global Central Moment
Tensor earthquake catalog. In the new forecasts we've improved the spatial
resolution to 0.1 degree and the latitude range from pole to pole. Our focal
mechanism estimates require distance-weighted combinations of observed focal
mechanisms within 1000 km of each grid point. Simultaneously we calculate an
average rotation angle between the forecasted mechanism and all the surrounding
mechanisms, using the method of Kagan & Jackson proposed in 1994. This average
angle reveals the level of tectonic complexity of a region and indicates the
accuracy of the prediction. The procedure becomes problematical where longitude
lines are not approximately parallel, and where earthquakes are so sparse that
an adequate sample spans very large distances. North or south of 75 degrees,
the azimuths of points 1000 km away may vary by about 35 degrees. We solved
this problem by calculating focal mechanisms on a plane tangent to the earth's
surface at each forecast point, correcting for the rotation of the longitude
lines at the locations of earthquakes included in the averaging. The
corrections are negligible between -30 and +30 degrees latitude, but outside
that band uncorrected rotations can be significantly off.

of type-beta combs which avoid 312 is shown to be the same as the number 1/(st

An external observer, for whom the pumping mechanism is not accessible, will

pump, the actual entropy production turns out to be lower than the coarse
grained entropy production estimated from the flows and affinities of the
resulting Markov chain. Moreover, in presence of a large time scale separation
between the fast pumping dynamics and the slow network dynamics, a finite
current with zero dissipation may be produced. We make use of these general

high free energy molecules at a finite rate and a rotatory motor achieving

a new-generation instrument for CFHT. SPIRou aims in particular at becoming
world-leader on two forefront science topics, (i) the quest for habitable
Earth-like planets around very- low-mass stars, and (ii) the study of low-mass
star and planet formation in the presence of magnetic fields. In addition to
these two main goals, SPIRou will be able to tackle many key programs, from
weather patterns on brown dwarf to solar-system planet atmospheres, to dynamo
processes in fully-convective bodies and planet habitability. The science
programs that SPIRou proposes to tackle are forefront (identified as first
priorities by most research agencies worldwide), ambitious (competitive and
complementary with science programs carried out on much larger facilities, such
as ALMA and JWST) and timely (ideally phased with complementary space missions
like TESS and CHEOPS).
  SPIRou is designed to carry out its science mission with maximum efficiency
and optimum precision. More specifically, SPIRou will be able to cover a very
wide single-shot nIR spectral domain (0.98-2.35 \mu m) at a resolving power of
73.5K, providing unpolarized and polarized spectra of low-mass stars with a
~15% average throughput and a radial velocity (RV) precision of 1 m/s.

yields insights into the nature and fragility of the ordered state, as well as
being of great practical importance. In some rare cases defects are
spontaneously healed - a one-dimensional crystal formed by a line of identical
charged particles, for example, can accommodate an interstitial (extra
particle) by a re-adjusting all particle positions to even out the spacing. In
sharp contrast, particles organized into a perfect hexagonal crystal in the
plane cannot accommodate an interstitial by a simple re-adjustment of the
particle spacing - the interstitial remains instead trapped between lattice
sites and diffuses by hopping, leaving the crystal permanently defected. Here
we report on the behavior of interstitials in colloidal crystals on curved
surfaces. Using optical tweezers operated independently of three dimensional
imaging, we insert a colloidal interstitial in a lattice of similar particles
on flat and curved (positively and negatively) oil-glycerol interfaces and
image the ensuing dynamics. We find that, unlike in flat space, the curved
crystals self-heal through a collective rearrangement that re-distributes the
increased density associated with the interstitial. The self-healing process
can be interpreted in terms of an out of equilibrium interaction of topological
defects with each other and with the underlying curvature. Our observations
suggest the existence of ""particle fractionalization"" on curved surface
crystals.

family of classification machines, the FLexible Assortment MachinE (FLAME) is
proposed, within which DWD and SVM are special cases. The FLAME family helps to
identify the similarities and differences between SVM and DWD. It is well known
that many classifiers overfit the data in the high-dimensional setting; and
others are sensitive to the imbalanced data, that is, the class with a larger
sample size overly influences the classifier and pushes the decision boundary
towards the minority class. SVM is resistant to the imbalanced data issue, but
it overfits high-dimensional data sets by showing the undesired data-piling
phenomena. The DWD method was proposed to improve SVM in the high-dimensional
setting, but its decision boundary is sensitive to the imbalanced ratio of
sample sizes. Our FLAME family helps to understand an intrinsic connection
between SVM and DWD, and improves both methods by providing a better trade-off
between sensitivity to the imbalanced data and overfitting the high-dimensional

in a theory of scalar electrodynamics in 3+1 dimensions. We restrict our
analysis to the case of thin-walled cosmic strings which occur when large
magnetic flux trapped inside the string. Thus the string looks like a tube of
fixed radius, at which it is classically stable. The core of the string
contains magnetic flux in the true vacuum, while outside the string, separated
by a thin wall, is the false vacuum. The string decays by tunnelling to a
configuration which is represented by a bulge, where the region of true vacuum
within, is ostensibly enlarged. The bulge can be described as the meeting, of a
kink soliton anti-soliton pair, along the length of the string. It can be
described as a bulge appearing in the initial string, starting from the string
of small, classically stable radius, expanding to a fat string of large,
classically unstable (to expansion) radius and then returning back to the
string of small radius along its length. This configuration is the bounce point
of a corresponding O(2) symmetric instanton, which we can determine
numerically. Once the bulge appears it explodes in real time. The kink soliton
anti-soliton pair recede from each other along the length of the string with a
velocity that quickly approaches the speed of light, leaving behind a fat tube.
At the same time the radius of the fat tube that is being formed, expands
(transversely) as it is no longer classically stable, converting false vacuum
to the true vacuum with ever diluting magnetic field within. The rate of this
expansion is determined by the energy difference between the true vacuum and
the false vacuum. Our analysis could be applied to a network, of cosmic strings
formed in the very early universe or vortex lines in a superheated
superconductor.

merger of two binary compact objects, specifically by two neutron stars or by a
neutron star orbiting a black hole. According to the Li-Paczynski kilonova
model, the merger would launch sub-relativistic ejecta and a
near-infrared/optical transient would then occur, lasting up to days, which is
powered by the radioactive decay of heavy elements synthesized in the ejecta.
The detection of a late bump using the {\em Hubble Space Telescope} ({\em HST})
in the near-infrared afterglow light curve of the short-hard GRB 130603B is
indeed consistent with such a model. However, as shown in this Letter, the
limited {\em HST} near-infrared lightcurve behavior can also be interpreted as
the synchrotron radiation of the external shock driven by a wide mildly
relativistic outflow. In such a scenario, the radio emission is expected to
peak with a flux of $\sim 100 \mu$Jy, which is detectable for current radio
arrays. Hence, the radio afterglow data can provide complementary evidence on
the nature of the bump in GRB 130603B. It is worth noting that good
spectroscopy during the bump phase in short-hard bursts can test validity of
either model above, analogous to spectroscopy of broad-lined Type Ic supernova
in long-soft GRBs.

intrapersonal interpersonal, practical, socio-cultural, economic, and
environmental aspects. It can be challenging to incorporate creativity in
classrooms. Teachers tend to inhibit creativity by focusing on reproduction of
knowledge, obedience and passivity in class, and correct responses, which are
easier to evaluate than creative ones. Teaching in such a way as to discourage
creative answers and approaches may lead to higher scores on standardized tests
(with all the sociological, marketplace, and political consequences that
entails). Teachers claim to value creativity, but to hold negative attitudes
toward, and show little tolerance of, attributes associated with creativity,
such as risk taking, impulsivity, and independence. When teachers do encourage
creativity, it is often the case that neither teacher nor students knows what
the expectations are. Moreover, students fear that they will be critically
judged if they produce something in which they have invested at a personal
level. Despite the potentially threatening aspects of encouraging creative
classrooms, no other investment in education could be more important and
rewarding. The phrase 'creative potential' is generally used to refer to how
likely a given individual is to manifest creative works in the future, as
assessed by scores on creativity tests. The concept of potentiality and its
relationship to actuality and context has been studied in depth by physicists.
This chapter explores how the physical conception of potentiality can shed
light on the notion of potential as it applies in the classroom, and in
particular, on how we conceive of and actualize students' creative potential.
We then discuss methods that will help optimize the creative potential of
students in less threatening ways.

potential from the Lagrangian density of the NJL model in the mean field
approximation. Using this thermodynamic potential, we get the gap equation of
the chiral condensate and the pion condensate. The effect of external magnetic
field on the pion condensate is not simple promotion or suppression, which we
will discuss in detail in the paper. It is shown that the tricritical point on
the pion superfluidity phase transition line moves to the space with smaller
isospin chemical potential and higher temperature when the external magnetic
field becomes stronger. The influence of external magnetic field on the chiral

to study the interplay between a number of important physical phenomena, in
particular, pulsations, magnetic fields, diffusion, and convection.
Nevertheless, the simple understanding of how the observed pulsations are
excited in these stars is still in progress. In this work we perform a test to
what is possibly the most widely accepted excitation theory for this class of
stellar pulsators. The test is based on the study of a subset of members of
this class for which stringent data on the fundamental parameters are available
thanks to interferometry. For three out of the four stars considered in this
study, we find that linear, non-adiabatic models with envelope convection
suppressed around the magnetic poles can reproduce well the frequency region
where oscillations are observed. For the fourth star in our sample no agreement
is found, indicating that a new excitation mechanism must be considered. For
the three stars whose observed frequencies can be explained by the excitation
models under discussion, we derive the minimum angular extent of the region
where convection must be suppressed. Finally, we find that the frequency
regions where modes are expected to be excited in these models is very
sensitive to the stellar radius. This opens the interesting possibility of
determining this quantity and related ones, such as the effective temperature
or luminosity, from comparison between model predictions and observations, in
other targets for which these parameters are not well determined.

determining the curvature dependence of the interfacial heat and mass transfer
resistances. We determine the interfacial resistances as a function of a

previously. This class of active galactic nuclei has been known to show little
IR emission from a dusty structure, but is yet poorly understood in terms of
number evolution or of dependence on physical quantities. In order to better
understand the luminous dust poor quasar properties, we compiled a rest-frame
UV to IR library of 41,000 optically selected type-1 quasars with
$L_{bol}>10^{45.7} erg s^{-1}$. After fitting the broad-band spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) with accretion disk and dust components, we find 0.6% of
our sample to be hot dust poor with a rest-frame 2.3 micron to 0.51 micron flux
density ratio of -0.5 dex or less. The dust poor SEDs are blue in the
UV-optical and weak in the MIR, such that their accretion disks are less
obscured, and that hot dust emission traces that of warm dust down to the dust
poor regime. At a given bolometric luminosity, dust poor quasars are lower in
black hole mass and higher in Eddington ratio than general luminous quasars,
suggesting that they are in a rapidly growing evolutionary state in which the
dust poor phase appears as a short or rare phenomenon. The dust poor fraction
increases with redshift, and possible implications for the evolution of the
dust poor fraction are discussed.

excitation mechanism to organic-level geometric propagation, a new theory
inspired by quantum electrodynamic theory for light propagation is proposed by
describing the cardiac excitation propagation as the continuation of absorption
and emission of charged ions by myocardial cells. By the choice of gauge and
the membrane current density, a set of Maxwell's equations with a charge
density and a current density is constructed in macroscopic bidomain and is
shown to be equivalent to the diffusion-reaction system with the B. van der Pol
oscillator. The derived Maxwell's equations for the excitation propagation
obeys the conservational laws of the number of the cations, energy and
momentum, but the total charge is not conserved. The Lagrangian is derived to
reveal that the trajectory and wavefront of the excitation propagation are the
same as the electrodynamic wave if ion channels work uniformly. From the second
quantization, the Hamiltonian is also derived to explain the excitation
mechanism of the myocardial cell by Feynman's diagram and the mechanism of the
refractory period in the perspective of positron. The effects of the external
electromagnetic field are explained both from the action of the Lagrangian and
the interaction by the Hamiltonian.

to-bainite () phase transformation is quantitatively investigated in
high-strength C-Mn steels. In particular, the present study aims to clarify the
respective contributions of the conditioning during the hot rolling and the
variant selection (VS) during the phase transformation to the inherited
texture. To this end, an alternative crystallographic reconstruction procedure,
which can be directly applied to experimental electron backscatter diffraction
(EBSD) mappings, is developed by combining the best features of the existing
models: the orientation relationship (OR) refinement, the local pixel-by-pixel
analysis and the nuclei identification and spreading strategy. The
applicability of this method is demonstrated on both quenching and partitioning
(Q&P) and as-quenched lath-martensite steels. The results obtained on the C-Mn
steels confirm that the sample finish rolled at the lowest temperature
(829{\deg}C) exhibits the sharpest transformation texture. It is shown that
this sharp texture is exclusively due to a strong VS from parent brass
{110}<1-12>, S {213}<-3-64> and Goss {110}<001> grains, whereas the VS from the
copper {112}<-1-11> grains is insensitive to the FRT. In addition, a
statistical VS analysis proves that the habit planes of the selected variants
do not systematically correspond to the predicted active slip planes using the
Taylor model. In contrast, a correlation between the Bain group to which the
selected variants belong and the FRT is clearly revealed, regardless of the
parent orientation. These results are discussed in terms of polygranular
accommodation mechanisms, especially in view of the observed development in the
hot-rolled samples of high-angle grain boundaries with misorientation axes

photons lag hard photons), whereas QPOs in the radio-bright plateau state are
found below 2.2 Hz and consistently show hard lags. The phase lag at the QPO
frequency is strongly anti-correlated with the QPO frequency, changing sign at
2.2 Hz. However, the phase lag at the frequency of the first harmonic is
positive and nearly independent of frequency at at ~0.172 rad, regardless of
the radio emission. The lag-energy dependence at the first harmonic is also
independent of radio flux. However, the lags at the QPO frequency are negative
at all energies during the radio-quiet state, but lags at the QPO frequency
during the plateau state are positive at all energies and show a
'reflection-type' evolution of the lag-energy spectra with respect to the

is some evidence for a break around 4-6 keV. Finally, the Fourier
frequency-dependent phase lag spectra are fairly flat during the plateau state,

This technique enables us to address the location of the possible broad
physical features in the primordial spectrum with relatively smaller number of
bins compared to the analysis performed earlier. This approach is in fact a
reconstruction method looking for broad features in the primordial spectrum and
avoiding fitting noise in the data. Performing Markov Chain Monte Carlo
analysis we present samples of the allowed primordial spectra with broad

step-like features in primordial spectrum we revisit an inflationary model,
proposed by A. A. Starobinsky which can address the similar features obtained

numerically calculate the local $f_{\rm NL}$ for this model in equilateral and
arbitrary triangular configurations of wavevectors and show that the obtained
non-Gaussianity for this model is consistent with Planck results. In this paper

the cosmological scale that the spectral index needs to have a red tilt and it

fluorescent iron line is always significantly detected. Fits with a gaussian or
Laor profiles give statistically equivalent results. In the case of a Laor
profile, fits of the five data sets simultaneously agree with a disk
inclination angle of ~20 degrees. The disk inner radius is <10-30 R_g in the
first two observations but almost unconstrained in the last three. A soft X-ray
excess is also present in these two first observations. Fits with a multicolor
disk component give disk inner radii in agreement with those obtained with the
iron line fits. The use of a physically more realistic model, including a
blurred reflection component and a comptonization continuum, give some hints of
the increase of the disk inner radius but the significances are always weak.
Interestingly, the addition of warm absorption significantly improves the fit
of OBS1 while it is not needed in the other observations. The radio-jet
re-ignition occurring between OBS1 and OBS2, these absorption features may
indicate the natural evolution from a disk wind and a jet. The comparison with
a long 2008 Suzaku observation of GX 339-4 in a persistent faint hard state

groups (M_group ~ 1-6x10^13 Msolar, z~0.05) from the Zurich Environmental Study
(ZENS). We aim to establish the frequency and properties, unaffected by host
galaxy dilution and obscuration, of AGNs in central and satellite galaxy
members, also as a function of halo-centric distance. X-ray point-source
detections are reported for 22 of 177 observed galaxies, down to a limit of
f_(0.5-8 keV) ~ 5x10^-15 erg cm^-2 s^-1, corresponding to a limiting luminosity
of L_(0.5-8 keV)~3x10^40 erg s^-1. With the majority of the X-ray sources
attributed to AGNs of low-to-moderate levels (L/L_Edd>~10^-4), we discuss the
detection rate in the context of the occupation of AGNs to halos of this mass
scale and redshift, and compare the structural/morphological properties between
AGN-active and non-active galaxies of different rank and location within the
group halos. We see a slight tendency for AGN hosts to have either relatively
brighter/denser disks (or relatively fainter/diffuse bulges) than non-active
galaxies of similar mass. At galaxy mass scales <10^11 Msolar, central galaxies
appear to be a factor ~4 more likely to host AGNs than satellite galaxies of
similar mass. This effect, coupled with the tendency for AGNs to reside in
massive galaxies, explains the (weak) trend for AGNs to be preferentially found
in the inner regions of groups, with no detectable trend with halo-centric
distance in the frequency of AGNs within the satellite population. Finally, our
data support other analyses in finding that the rate of decline with redshift
of AGN activity in groups matches that of the global AGN population, indicating
that either AGNs occur preferentially in groups, or that the evolution rate is
independent of halo mass. These trends are of potential importance, and require
X-ray coverage of a larger sample to be solidly confirmed.

  PhD TPhy 108, 2013",,,"cond-mat.supr-con","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There are two general ways to compress the cuprates, by external pressure or
by internal pressure as induced by isovalent-ion substitution. Paradoxically,
they have the opposite effect on the superconducting transition temperature.
This thesis seeks to understand the salient difference between these two
pressures.
  We study three families of cuprates where the ion size can be systematically
altered; Bi$_2$(Sr$_{1.6-x}$A$_x$)Ln$_{0.4}$CuO$_{6+ \delta}$, ACuO$_2 $ and
LnBa$_{2-x} $Sr$_x $Cu$_3 $O$_{7-\delta} $ where Ln is a Lanthenide or Y and
A=\{Mg,Ca,Sr,Ba\}. We use a variety of techniques to explore our paradox, for
example; Raman spectroscopy to measure the antiferromagnetic exchange energy
and energy gaps, Density Functional Theory to calculate the density of states,
Muon Spin Relaxation to measure the superfluid density as well as a variety of
more conventional techniques to synthesize and characterise our samples.
  Our Raman studies show that an energy scale for spin fluctuations cannot
resolve the different effects of the two pressures. Similarly the density of
states, while an important property, does not clearly resolve the paradox. Our
superfluid density measurements show that the disorder resulting from
isovalent-ion substitution is secondary in importance for the superconducting
transition temperature.
  Instead, we find that the polarisability is a key property of the cuprates
with regard to superconductivity. This understanding resolves the paradox! It
implies that electron pairing results from either (i) a short-range interaction
where the polarisability screens repulsive longer-range interactions and/or
(ii) the relatively unexplored idea of the exchange of quantized, coherent
polarisation waves. More generally, we have also demonstrated the utility of
studying ion-size effects to further our collective understanding of the
cuprates.

regular patterns in their pulsation spectra. This has raised the question as to
their physical origin, and in particular, whether they can be explained by an
asymptotic frequency formula for low-degree acoustic modes, as recently
discovered through numerical calculations and theoretical considerations. In
this context, a key question is whether compositional/density gradients can
adversely affect such patterns to the point of hindering their identification.
To answer this question, we calculate frequency spectra using two-dimensional
ESTER stellar models. These models use a multi-domain spectral approach,
allowing us to easily insert a compositional discontinuity while retaining a
high numerical accuracy. We analyse the effects of such discontinuities on both
the frequencies and eigenfunctions of pulsation modes in the asymptotic regime.
We find that although there is more scatter around the asymptotic frequency
formula, the semi-large frequency separation can still be clearly identified in
a spectrum of low-degree acoustic modes.

channel hardening} that occurs in large MIMO channels. Channel hardening refers
to the phenomenon where the off-diagonal terms of the ${\bf H}^H{\bf H}$ matrix
become increasingly weaker compared to the diagonal terms as the size of the
channel gain matrix ${\bf H}$ increases. Specifically, we propose a message
passing detection (MPD) algorithm which works with the real-valued matched
filtered received vector (whose signal term becomes ${\bf H}^T{\bf H}{\bf x}$,
where ${\bf x}$ is the transmitted vector), and uses a Gaussian approximation
on the off-diagonal terms of the ${\bf H}^T{\bf H}$ matrix. We also propose a
simple estimation scheme which directly obtains an estimate of ${\bf H}^T{\bf
H}$ (instead of an estimate of ${\bf H}$), which is used as an effective
channel estimate in the MPD algorithm. We refer to this receiver as the {\em
channel hardening-exploiting message passing (CHEMP)} receiver. The proposed
CHEMP receiver achieves very good performance in large-scale MIMO systems
(e.g., in systems with 16 to 128 uplink users and 128 base station antennas).
For the considered large MIMO settings, the complexity of the proposed MPD
algorithm is almost the same as or less than that of the minimum mean square
error (MMSE) detection. This is because the MPD algorithm does not need a
matrix inversion. It also achieves a significantly better performance compared
to MMSE and other message passing detection algorithms using MMSE estimate of
${\bf H}$. We also present a convergence analysis of the proposed MPD
algorithm. Further, we design optimized irregular low density parity check
(LDPC) codes specific to the considered large MIMO channel and the CHEMP
receiver through EXIT chart matching. The LDPC codes thus obtained achieve
improved coded bit error rate performance compared to off-the-shelf irregular
LDPC codes.

progressively from that of a metal. However, in contrast to expectations that
replacing Fe with Cu would suppress the magnetic correlations, the low-energy
(no larger than 12 meV) magnetic scattering is enhanced in strength, with
greater spectral weight and longer dynamical spin-spin correlation lengths.
Such enhancements can be a consequence of either enlarged local moments or a
slowing down of the spin fluctuations. In either case, the localization of the
conduction states induced by the Cu doping should play a critical role. Our
results are not applicable to models that treat 3d transition metal dopants

dependent on the scalar field. We consider Bianchi type I universe in the
gravitational framework of scalar-tensor gravity and explore the general form
of the scalar field potential. In particular, this field potential is
investigated for the matter contents like barotropic fluid, the cosmological
constant and Chaplygin gas. It is concluded that for a given value of Hubble
parameter, one can reconstruct the scalar potentials which can generate the
cosmology motivated by these matter contents.

particular interest for the application of frozen-core approximations and
pseudopotentials in time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and the
single-active-electron (SAE) approximation in strong-field laser physics.
Results of TDDFT and SAE calculations are compared with exact ones obtained by
the numerical ab initio solution of the three-electron time-dependent
Schr\""odinger equation for a lithium model atom. It is found that dynamical
anti-screening, i.e., a particular form of dynamical core polarization, may
substantially alter the ionization rate in the single-photon regime.
Requirements for the validity of the approximations in the single and

to characterize these excited states, or excitons, to optimize device
performance in applications like displays and solar energy harvesting. This is
complicated if the excited state is a triplet because the electronic transition
is dark with a vanishing oscillator strength. As a consequence, triplet state
spectroscopy must usually be performed at cryogenic temperatures to reduce
competition from non-radiative rates. Here, we control non-radiative rates by
engineering a solid-state host matrix containing the target molecule, allowing
the observation of phosphorescence at room temperature and alleviating
constraints of cryogenic experiments. We test these techniques on a wide range
of materials with functionalities spanning multi-exciton generation (singlet
exciton fission), organic light emitting device host materials, and thermally
activated delayed fluorescence type emitters. Control of non-radiative modes in
the matrix surrounding a target molecule may also have broader applications in

raises potential reliability issues for the grid due to the fluctuating nature
of its source. To achieve adequate reserve commitment and to promote market
participation, it is necessary to provide models that can capture daily
patterns in wind power production. This paper presents a cyclic inhomogeneous
Markov process, which is based on a three-dimensional state-space (wind power,
speed and direction). Each time-dependent transition probability is expressed
as a Bernstein polynomial. The model parameters are estimated by solving a
constrained optimization problem: The objective function combines two maximum
likelihood estimators, one to ensure that the Markov process long-term behavior
reproduces the data accurately and another to capture daily fluctuations. A
convex formulation for the overall optimization problem is presented and its
applicability demonstrated through the analysis of a case-study. The proposed
model is capable of reproducing the diurnal patterns of a three-year dataset
collected from a wind turbine located in a mountainous region in Portugal. In
addition, it is shown how to compute persistence statistics directly from the
Markov process transition matrices. Based on the case-study, the power
production persistence through the daily cycle is analysed and discussed.

OH doublets with different excitation requirements. At least two outflowing
components are identified, one with OH radiatively excited, and the other with
low excitation, presumably spatially extended. Particularly prominent, the blue
wing of the absorption detected in the in-ladder 2Pi_{3/2} J=9/2-7/2 OH doublet
at 65 um, with E_lower=290 K, indicates that the excited outflowing gas is
generated in a compact and warm (circum)nuclear region. Because the excited,
outflowing OH gas in Mrk 231 is associated with the warm, far-IR continuum
source, it is likely more compact (diameter of 200-300 pc) than that probed by
CO and HCN. Nevertheless, its mass-outflow rate per unit of solid angle as
inferred from OH is similar to that previously derived from CO,
>~70x(2.5x10^{-6}/X_{OH}) Msun yr^{-1} sr^{-1}, where X_{OH} is the OH
abundance relative to H nuclei. In spherical symmetry, this would correspond to
>~850x(2.5x10^{-6}/X_{OH}) Msun yr^{-1}, though significant collimation is
inferred from the line profiles. The momentum flux of the excited component
attains ~15 L_{AGN}/c, with an OH column density of (1.5-3)x10^{17} cm^-2 and a
mechanical luminosity of ~10^{11} Lsun. The detection of very excited OH
peaking at central velocities indicates the presence of a nuclear reservoir of
gas rich in OH, plausibly the 130-pc scale circumnuclear torus previously
detected in OH megamaser emission, that may be feeding the outflow. An
exceptional ^{18}OH enhancement, with OH/^{18}OH<~30 at both central and
blueshifted velocities, is likely the result of interstellar-medium processing

$\delta$ Sct star H254, member of the young cluster IC 348. Photometric
V,R$_C$,I$_C$ light curves were obtained at the Loiano and Asiago telescopes.
The radial velocity data was acquired by means of the SARG@TNG spectrograph.
High-resolution spectroscopy allowed us to derive precise stellar parameters
and the chemical composition of the star, obtaining: T$_{\rm
eff}$\,=\,6750\,$\pm$\,150 K; $\log g$\,=\,4.1\,$\pm$\,0.4 dex;
[Fe/H]=-0.07$\pm$0.12 dex. Photometric and spectroscopic data were used to
estimate the total absorption in the $V$ band A$_{\rm V}$=2.06$\pm$0.05 mag, in
agreement with previous estimates. We adopted the technique of the difference
in phase and amplitude between different photometric bands and radial
velocities to verify that H254 is (definitely) pulsating in a radial mode. This
occurrence allowed us to apply the CORS realization of the Baade--Wesselink
method to obtain a value for the linear radius of H254 equal to 3.3$\pm$0.7
$R_\odot$.
  This result was used in conjunction with photometry and effective temperature
to derive a distance estimate of 273$\pm$23 pc for H254, and, in turn for IC
348, the host cluster. This value is in agreement within the errors with the
results derived from several past determinations and the evaluation obtained
through the Hipparcos parallaxes. Finally, we derived the luminosity of H254
and studied its position in the Hertzsprung--Russell diagram. From this
analysis it results that this $\delta$--Scuti occupies a position close to the
red edge of the instability strip, pulsates in the fundamental mode, has a mass
of about 2.2 $M_\odot$ and an age of 5$\pm$1 Myr, older than previous
estimates.

information carrier, and a quantum memory with high fidelity and reliability is
the prerequisite for realizing a long-distance quantum communication and a
quantum network. Encoding photons into higher-dimensional states could
significantly increase their information-carrying capability and network
capacity. Moreover, the large-alphabet quantum key distribution affords a more
secure flux of information. Quantum memories have been realized in different
physical systems, such as atomic ensembles and solid systems etc., but to date,
all quantum memories only realize the storage and retrieval of the photons
lived in a two-dimensional space spanned for example by orthogonal
polarizations, therefore only a quantum bit could be stored there. Here, we
report on the first experimental realization of a quantum memory storing a
photon lived in a three-dimensional space spanned by orbital angular momentums
via electromagnetically induced transparency in a cold atomic ensemble. We
reconstruct the storage process density matrix with the fidelity of 85.3% by
the aid of a 4-f imaging system experimentally. The ability to store a
high-dimensional quantum state with high fidelity is very promising for
building a high-dimensional quantum network.

exactly solvable. In particular the k-point correlation can be written as a k

overshoot of the density as the edge of the leading support is approached from

the large deviation form of the density for N large but finite. This asymptotic

stopping force which decelerates and stops the intruder. Many previous studies
have used a macroscopic force law, including a drag force which is quadratic in
velocity, to characterize the decelerating force on the intruder. However, the
microscopic origins of the force law terms are still a subject of debate. Here,
drawing from previous experiments with photoelastic particles, we present a
model which describes the velocity-squared force in terms of repeated
collisions with clusters of grains. From our high speed photoelastic data, we
infer that `clusters' correspond to segments of the strong force network that
are excited by the advancing intruder. The model predicts a scaling relation
for the velocity-squared drag force that accounts for the intruder shape.
Additionally, we show that the collisional model predicts an instability to
rotations, which depends on the intruder shape. To test this model, we perform
a comprehensive experimental study of the dynamics of two-dimensional granular
impacts on beds of photoelastic disks, with different profiles for the leading
edge of the intruder. We particularly focus on a simple and useful case for
testing shape effects by using triangular-nosed intruders. We show that the
collisional model effectively captures the dynamics of intruder deceleration
and rotation; i.e., these two dynamical effects can be described as two
different manifestations of the same grain-scale physical processes.

momentum dependences are taken into account with improved precision compared to
previous studies of related models. Around a generic parameter set, we find a
strong competition of antiferromagnetic and d-wave Cooper instabilities with a
smooth behavior under a variation of doping and additional hopping parameters.
For increasingly incommensurate ordering tendencies in the magnetic channel,
the d-wave pairing gap is deformed at its maxima. Comparing our results for the
Emery model to those obtained for the two-dimensional one-band Hubbard model
with effective parameters, we find that, despite considerable qualitative
agreement, multi-orbital effects have a significant impact on a quantitative
level.

multiple channels sharing a common subgradient with respect to a suitable

common direction of the normals to the level lines) in the case of the total
variation (TV), we propose to determine each iterate by regularizing each
channel with a weighted linear combination of Bregman distances to all other
image channels from the previous iteration. In this sense we generalize the
Bregman iteration proposed by Osher et al. to multichannel images. We prove the
convergence of the proposed scheme, analyze stationary points and present
numerical experiments on color image denoising, which show the superior
behavior of our approach in comparison to TV, TV with Bregman iterations on
each channel separately, and vectorial TV. Additionally, we propose to use the
infimal convolution of Bregman distances to different channels from the

independence of the direction of the edge. While this work focuses on TV
regularization, the proposed scheme can potentially improve any variational
multichannel reconstruction method with a 1-homogeneous regularization.

inhomogeneous in this respect. Such an inhomogeneity of vertices may influence
the connection probability between pairs of vertices.
  The purpose of this paper is to propose a new inhomogeneous random graph
model which is obtained in a constructive way from the Erd\""os-R\'enyi random
graph G(n,p). Given a configuration of n vertices arranged in N subsets of
vertices (we call each subset a super-vertex), we define a random graph with N
super-vertices by letting two super-vertices be connected if and only if there
is at least one edge between them in G(n,p). Our main result concerns the
threshold for connectedness. We also analyze the phase transition for the
emergence of the giant component and the degree distribution.
  Even though our model begins with G(n,p), it assumes the existence of some
community structure encoded in the configuration. Furthermore, under certain
conditions it exhibits a power law degree distribution. Both properties are
important for real applications.

dilute solution atomization is demonstrated. The criteria of the system
settings to generate the droplet flow with specified characteristics were
determined. A Laval nozzle design is suggested for liquid atomization. A series
of numerical experiments showed that a significant decrease in gas pressure

diffusion to avoid resolving the small scales. However, we expect this approach
to break down when time and length scales of the turbulence become comparable
with other relevant time and length scales in the system. Turbulent diffusion
has previously been applied to the magneto-rotational instability (MRI), but no
quantitative comparison of growth rates at different turbulent intensities has
been performed. We investigate to what extent turbulent diffusion can be used
to model the effects of small-scale turbulence on the kinematic growth rates of
the MRI, and how this depends on angular velocity and magnetic field strength.
We use direct numerical simulations in three-dimensional shearing boxes with
periodic boundary conditions in the spanwise direction and additional random
plane-wave volume forcing to drive a turbulent flow at a given length scale. We
estimate the turbulent diffusivity using a mixing length formula and compare
with results obtained with the test-field method. It turns out that the concept
of turbulent diffusion is remarkably accurate in describing the effect of
turbulence on the growth rate of the MRI. No noticeable breakdown of turbulent
diffusion has been found, even when time and length scales of the turbulence
become comparable with those imposed by the MRI itself. On the other hand,
quenching of turbulent magnetic diffusivity by the magnetic field is found to

connection between the estimates for the diffusion rate along simple resonances
in multidimensional nonlinear Hamiltonian systems that can be obtained using
the heuristic theory of Chirikov and a more formal one due to Nekhoroshev. We
show that, despite a wide-spread impression, the two theories are complementary
rather than antagonist. Indeed, although Chirikov's 1979 review has thousands
of citations, almost all of them refer to topics such as the resonance overlap
criterion, fast diffusion, the Standard or Whisker Map, and not to the
constructive theory providing a formula to measure diffusion along a single
resonance. However, as will be demonstrated explicitly below, Chirikov's
formula provides values of the diffusion coefficient which are quite well
comparable to the numerically computed ones, provided that it is implemented on
the so-called optimal normal form derived as in the analytic part of
Nekhoroshev's theorem. On the other hand, Chirikov's formula yields unrealistic
values of the diffusion coefficient, in particular for very small values of the
perturbation, when used in the original Hamiltonian instead of the optimal
normal form. In the present paper, we take advantage of this complementarity in
order to obtain accurate theoretical predictions for the local value of the
diffusion coefficient along a resonance in a specific 3DoF nearly integrable
Hamiltonian system. Besides, we compute numerically the diffusion coefficient
and a full comparison of all estimates is made for ten values of the
perturbation parameter, showing a very satisfactory agreement.

topological insulators and discuss the effect of perturbations breaking either
particle-number conservation or time-reversal symmetry. The appearance of
trivial mass terms is expected to cause quantum phase transitions into trivial
phases when such a perturbation overweights the topological term. These phase
transitions are usually associated with a bulk-gap closing. In contrast, the
chiral Chern insulator is unaffected by particle-number breaking perturbations.
Moreover, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulator undergoes phase transitions
into topologically trivial phases without bulk-gap closing in the presence of
any of such perturbations. In certain cases, these phase transitions can be
circumvented and the protection restored by another U(1) symmetry, e.g. due to
spin conservation. These findings are discussed in the context of interacting
topological insulators.

with data in a sequential fashion. Despite its widespread use, there has been
little analysis of its theoretical properties. Many of the algorithmic
innovations associated with the filter, which are required to make a useable
algorithm in practice, are derived in an ad hoc fashion. The aim of this paper
is to initiate the development of a systematic analysis of the EnKF, in
particular to do so in the small ensemble size limit. The perspective is to
view the method as a state estimator, and not as an algorithm which
approximates the true filtering distribution. The perturbed observation version
of the algorithm is studied, without and with variance inflation. Without
variance inflation well-posedness of the filter is established; with variance
inflation accuracy of the filter, with resepct to the true signal underlying
the data, is established. The algorithm is considered in discrete time, and
also for a continuous time limit arising when observations are frequent and
subject to large noise. The underlying dynamical model, and assumptions about
it, is sufficiently general to include the Lorenz '63 and '96 models, together
with the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation on a two-dimensional torus. The
analysis is limited to the case of complete observation of the signal with
additive white noise. Numerical results are presented for the Navier-Stokes
equation on a two-dimensional torus for both complete and partial observations
of the signal with additive white noise.

stars at orbital distances of >10 au as the host star ages through the Main
Sequence (MS) and well into the White Dwarf (WD) stage. Systems are stable on
the MS if the planets are separated by more than ~9 Hill radii. Most systems
surviving the MS will remain stable until the WD phase, although planets
scattered onto small pericentres in unstable systems can be swallowed by the
expanding stellar envelope when the star ascends the giant branches. Mass loss
at the end of the asymptotic giant branch triggers delayed instability in many
systems, leading to instabilities typically occurring at WD cooling ages of a
few 100 Myr. This instability occurs both in systems that survived the star's
previous evolution unscathed, and in systems that previously underwent
scattering instabilities. The outcome of such instability around WDs is
overwhelmingly the ejection of one of the planets from the system, with several
times more ejections occurring during the WD phase than during the MS.
Furthermore, few planets are scattered close to the WD, just outside the Roche
limit, where they can be tidally circularised. Hence, we predict that planets
in WD systems rarely dynamically evolve to become ""hot Jupiters"". Nor does it
appear that the observed frequency of metal pollution in WD atmospheres can be
entirely explained by planetesimals being destabilised following instability in
systems of multiple giant planets, although further work incorporating low-mass
planets and planetesimals is needed.

distinct types of finite string correlations for very large lattice distances,

two topologically ordered phases. As the bond alternation varies, a topological
quantum phase transition with continuously variable critical exponents along
the phase boundary occurs between the two Haldane phases for the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction stronger than the Ising interaction, while a
topological quantum crossover between them happens through an intermediate
antiferromagentic phase demonstrated with the quantum fidelity for the

is an eagerly awaited event. In this work, we do a mathematical study to check
whether meteoroids ejected from this comet during its journey around the sun

although the orbital elements of this comet are much more favourable than for
most sungrazers to have its descending node near the Earth's orbit, even
ejection velocities as high as 1 km/s do not induce sufficient nodal dispersion
to bring meteoroids to Earth intersection during present times. A similar
result applies to Newton's comet C/1680 V1 which has surprisingly similar
orbital elements, although it is known to be a distinct comet from C/2012 S1.
Our analysis also shows that for meteoroids ejected from all known sungrazing
groups during recent epochs, only the Marsden family (with required ejection
velocities of some hundreds of m/s) can produce meteor phenomena during present
times. In a broader sense, we indicate why we do not observe visually brilliant
meteor showers from frequently observed sungrazers.

establishes collective measurements as a powerful technique for generating

Lower acoustic levels would reduce structural fatigue leading to longer
lifetime of the jet aircraft. It is not solely structural aspects which are of
importance, health issues of the pilot and the airfield per- sonnel are also
very important, as high acoustic levels may result in severe hearing damage. It
remains a major challenge to reduce the overall noise levels of the aircraft,
where the supersonic exhaust is the main noise source for near ground
operation. Fluidic injection into the supersonic jet at the nozzle exhaust has
been shown as a promising method for noise reduction. It has been shown to
speed up the mix- ing process of the main jet, hence reducing the kinetic
energy level of the jet and the power of the total acoustic radiation.
Furthermore, the interaction mechanism between the fluidic injection and the
shock structure in the jet exhaust plays a crucial role in the total noise
radia- tion. In this study, LES is used to investigate the change in flow
struc- tures of a supersonic (M=1.56) jet from a converging-diverging nozzle.
Six fluidic actuators, evenly distributed around the nozzle exit, inject air in
a radial direction towards the main flow axis with a total mass flow ratio of
3%. Steady injection is compared with flapping injection. With flapping
injection turned on, the injection angle of each injector is varied
sinusoidally in the nozzle exit plane and the variation is the same for all
injectors. This fluid dynamics video is submitted to the APS DFD Gallery of

phase velocity remain anisotropic, the effective Poisson's ratio indeed becomes

it has a comparatively small field of view. This means that while observing the
solar photosphere, there has been no convenient way of calibrating the image
scale of the telescope. Other telescopes, such as NASA's Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO)utilize their larger Field of View (FOV) to use the solar disk
as a reference in order to measure the image scale. In the past, the image
scale of the SST has been determined by measuring the distance between the
moons of Jupiter in a captured SST image and comparing it to reference values,
as well as with the Venus transit of 2004. Both of these methods have their
drawbacks, including needing to open the telescope at night or waiting for the
very rare occurrence of a solar transit, which the telescope may not even be in
a position to observe. Additionally, assessing the accuracy of these methods
can be difficult. The purpose of this thesis is to examine the feasibility of
an idea proposed by the faculty of the Institute for Solar Physics at Stockholm
University, that would allow us to routinely calibrate the image scale of the
SST when desired and with known accuracy of the measurement, without the need
to open the telescope at night. The measurements performed so far are
consistent with the old value to about one third of a percent, with a total
uncertainty of the SST/CRISP image scale of about 0.1 percent. Resulting in a
grid spacing of the pinhole array of 5.15 arcseconds, which can be used to
determine the image scale of all the remaining science cameras of the SST.

concerns for individual privacy. There exist many privacy-preserving works that
can deal with different attack models. In this paper, we introduce a novel
privacy attack model and refer it as a mutual friend attack. In this model, the
adversary can re-identify a pair of friends by using their number of mutual
friends. To address this issue, we propose a new anonymity concept, called
k-NMF anonymity, i.e., k-anonymity on the number of mutual friends, which
ensures that there exist at least k-1 other friend pairs in the graph that
share the same number of mutual friends. We devise algorithms to achieve the
k-NMF anonymity while preserving the original vertex set in the sense that we
allow the occasional addition but no deletion of vertices. Further we give an
algorithm to ensure the k-degree anonymity in addition to the k-NMF anonymity.
The experimental results on real-word datasets demonstrate that our approach
can preserve the privacy and utility of social networks effectively against
mutual friend attacks.

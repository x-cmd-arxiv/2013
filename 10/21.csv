The intersection graph G(G) of G is an undirected graph
without loops and multiple edges defined as follows: the vertex set is the set
of all proper nontrivial subgroups of G; and there is an edge between two
distinct vertices X and Y if and only if X \ Y 6= 1 where 1 denotes the trivial
subgroup of G: It was conjectured in [2] that two (non cyclic) finite abelian
groups with isomorphic intersection graphs are isomorphic. In this paper we
study this conjecture and show that it is almost true. For any inite abelian
group D let Dnc be the product of all noncyclic Sylow subgroups of D: Our main
result is that: given any two (nontrivial) inite abelian groups A and B; their
intersection graphs G(A) and G(B) are isomorphic if and only if the groups Anc
and Bnc are isomorphic, and there is a bijection between the sets of
(nontrivial) cyclic Sylow subgroups of A and B satisfying a certain condition.
So, in particular, two finite abelian groups with isomorphic intersection
graphs will be isomorphic provided that one of the groups has no (nontrivial)
cyclic Sylow subgroup. Our methods are elementary.

innovation is easier on more regular graphs, i.e. with a higher clustering
coefficient. Moreover, in the case of uncertainty - which is particularly high

more clustered network will help the diffusion. On the other hand, when social
influence is less important (i.e. in the case of perfect information), a
shorter path will help the innovation to spread in the society and - as a
result - the diffusion will be easiest on a random graph.

classically defined on finite sets. In this paper we define association schemes
on arbitrary, possibly uncountable sets with a measure. We study operator
realizations of the adjacency algebras of schemes and derive simple properties
of these algebras. To develop a theory of general association schemes, we focus
on schemes on topological Abelian groups where we can employ duality theory and
the machinery of harmonic analysis. We construct translation association
schemes on such groups using the language of spectrally dual partitions. Such
partitions are shown to arise naturally on topological zero-dimensional Abelian
groups, for instance, Cantor-type groups or the groups of p-adic numbers. This
enables us to construct large classes of dual pairs of association schemes on
zero-dimensional groups with respect to their Haar measure, and to compute
their eigenvalues and intersection numbers. We also derive properties of
infinite metric schemes, connecting them with the properties of the
non-Archimedean metric on the group.
  Pursuing the connection between schemes on zero-dimensional groups and
harmonic analysis, we show that the eigenvalues have a natural interpretation
in terms of Littlewood-Paley wavelet bases, and in the (equivalent) language of
martingale theory. For a class of nonmetric schemes constructed in the paper,
the eigenvalues coincide with values of orthogonal functions on
zero-dimensional groups. We observe that these functions, which we call
Haar-like bases, have the properties of wavelets on the group, including in
some special cases the self-similarity property. This establishes a seemingly
new link between algebraic combinatorics and harmonic analysis.
  We conclude the paper by studying some analogs of problems of classical
coding theory related to the theory of association schemes.

model of complex systems with a critical point as an attractor of their
dynamics. This phenomenon, called self-organized criticality (SOC), appears to
occur ubiquitously in both nature and technology. Initially introduced on the
2D lattice, the BTW process has been studied on network structures with great
analytical successes in the estimation of macroscopic quantities, such as the
exponents of asymptotically power-law distributions. In this article, we take a
microscopic perspective and study the inner workings of the process through
both numerical and rigorous analysis. Our simulations reveal fundamental flaws
in the assumptions of past phenomenological models, the same models that
allowed accurate macroscopic predictions; we mathematically justify why
universality may explain these past successes. Next, starting from scratch, we
obtain microscopic understanding that enables mechanistic models; such models
can, for example, distinguish a cascade's area from its size. In the special
case of a 3-regular network, we use self-consistency arguments to obtain a
zero-parameters, mechanistic (bottom-up) approximation that reproduces
nontrivial correlations observed in simulations and that allows the study of
the BTW process on networks in regimes otherwise prohibitively costly to
investigate. We then generalize some of these results to configuration model
networks and explain how one could continue the generalization. The numerous
tools and methods presented herein are known to enable studying the effects of
controlling the BTW process and other self-organizing systems. More broadly,
our use of multitype branching processes to capture information bouncing
back-and-forth in a network could inspire analogous models of systems in which
consequences spread in a bidirectional fashion.

minimal, in the sense that no proper submodule or proper homomorphic image of M
is faithful.
  If R is local, and socle(R) is central in R, we show that
length(M/J(R)M)+length(socle(M))$\leq$ length(socle(R))+1, strengthening a
result of T. Gulliksen.
  Most of the rest of the paper is devoted to the situation where the Artinian
ring R is not necessarily local, and does not necessarily have central socle.
In the case where R is a finite-dimensional algebra over an algebraically
closed field, we get an inequality similar to the above, with the length of
socle(R) interpreted as its length as a bimodule, and with the final summand +1
replaced by the Euler characteristic of a bipartite graph determined by the
structure of socle(R). More generally, that inequality holds if, rather than
assuming k algebraically closed, we assume that R/J(R) is a direct product of
full matrix algebras over k, and exclude the case where k has small finite
cardinality. Examples show that the restriction on the cardinality of k is
needed; we do not know whether versions of our result hold with other
hypotheses significantly weakened.
  The situation for faithful modules with only one minimality property, i.e.,
having no faithful proper submodules or having no faithful proper homomorphic
images, is more straightforward: The length of M/J(R)M in the former case, and
of socle(M) in the latter, is $\leq$ length(socle(R)) (again meaning length as
a bimodule). The final section, essentially independent of the rest of the
note, obtains these bounds, and shows that every faithful module over a left
Artinian ring has a faithful submodule with the former minimality condition and
a faithful factor module with the latter. The proofs involve some nice general
results on decompositions of modules.

its very beginning in all spectral ranges. After reaching the firs maximum in

weakened by 1.45 mag. (V) by the spring/early summer of 2011. Since the autumn
of 2011, another light increase occurred and the star became brighter by 1.8

its maximum brightness during the period April - August 2013 and the recorded

most s projectors, decide whether there exists a quantum state in the null
space of all the projectors. Let f*(k) be the maximal integer s such that every

can have edges connected to more than two vertices. We develop theorems and
examples of our hypermap-homology codes, especially in the case that we choose
a special type of basis in our homology chain complex. In particular the most
straightforward generalization of the $m \times m$ toric code to
hypermap-homology codes gives us a $[(3/2)m^2,2,m]$ code as compared to the
toric code which is a $[2m^2,2,m]$ code. Thus we can protect the same amount of

fractional calculus of variations and fractional optimal control. Although
there are plenty of methods available in the literature, we concentrate mainly
on approximating the fractional problem either by discretizing the fractional
term or expanding the fractional derivatives as a series involving integer
order derivatives. The former method, as a subclass of direct methods in the
theory of calculus of variations, uses finite differences, Grunwald-Letnikov
definition in this case, to discretize the fractional term. Any quadrature rule
for integration, regarding the desired accuracy, is then used to discretize the
whole problem including constraints. The final task in this method is to solve
a static optimization problem to reach approximated values of the unknown
functions on some mesh points.
  The latter method, however, approximates fractional problems by classical
ones in which only derivatives of integer order are present. Precisely, two
continuous approximations for fractional derivatives by series involving
ordinary derivatives are introduced. Local upper bounds for truncation errors
are provided and, through some test functions, the accuracy of the
approximations are justified. Then we substitute the fractional term in the
original problem with these series and transform the fractional problem to an
ordinary one. Hereafter, we use indirect methods of classical theory, e.g.
Euler-Lagrange equations, to solve the approximated problem. The methods are
mainly developed through some concrete examples which either have obvious
solutions or the solution is computed using the fractional Euler-Lagrange
equation.

we survey this problem introduced in previous papers by the authors, we detail
its close relation with rearrangeable multicast networks, and we provide new
results for both viewpoints.
  A bijective mapping can be computed by 2n - 1 component modifications, that
is by a program of length 2n - 1, a result equivalent to the rearrangeability
of the concatenation of two reversed butterfly networks. For a general
arbitrary mapping, we give two methods to build a program with maximal length
4n-3. Equivalently, this yields rearrangeable multicast routing methods for the
network formed by four successive butterflies with alternating reversions. The
first method is available for any set S and practically equivalent to a known
method in network theory. The second method, a refinement of the first,
described when |S| is a power of 2, is new and allows more flexibility than the
known method.
  For a linear mapping, when S is any field, or a quotient of an Euclidean
domain (e.g. Z/sZ for any integer s), we build a program with maximal length 2n
- 1. In this case the assignments are also linear, thereby particularly
efficient from the algorithmic viewpoint, and giving moreover directly a
program for the inverse when it exists. This yields also a new result on matrix
decompositions, and a new result on the multicast properties of two successive
reversed butterflies. Results of this flavour were known only for the boolean
field Z/2Z.

stationary velocity autocorrelation function. We derive a generalization of the
Green-Kubo formula valid for systems with long-range or nonstationary
correlations for which the standard approach is no longer valid. For the
systems under consideration, the velocity autocorrelation function $\langle
v(t+\tau) v(t) \rangle$ asymptotically exhibits a certain scaling behavior and
the diffusion is anomalous $\langle x^2(t) \rangle \simeq 2 D_\nu t^{\nu}$. We
show how both the anomalous diffusion coefficient $D_\nu$ and exponent $\nu$
can be extracted from this scaling form. Our scaling Green-Kubo relation thus
extends an important relation between transport properties and correlation
functions to generic systems with scale invariant dynamics. This includes
stationary systems with slowly decaying power law correlations as well as aging
systems, whose properties depend on the the age of the system. Even for systems
that are stationary in the long time limit, we find that the long time
diffusive behavior can strongly depend on the initial preparation of the
system. In these cases, the diffusivity $D_{\nu}$ is not unique and we
determine its values for a stationary respectively nonstationary initial state.
We discuss three applications of the scaling Green-Kubo relation: Free
diffusion with nonlinear friction corresponding to cold atoms diffusing in
optical lattices, the fractional Langevin equation with external noise recently
suggested to model active transport in cells and the L\'evy walk with numerous
applications, in particular blinking quantum dots. These examples underline the
wide applicability of our approach, which is able to treat very different

and for designing better search and routing algorithms.
  In this paper, we focus on developing fast distributed algorithms for
computing sparse cuts in networks. Given an undirected $n$-node network $G$
with conductance $\phi$, the goal is to find a cut set whose conductance is
close to $\phi$. We present two distributed algorithms that find a cut set with
sparsity $\tilde O(\sqrt{\phi})$ ($\tilde{O}$ hides $\polylog{n}$ factors).
Both our algorithms work in the CONGEST distributed computing model and output
a cut of conductance at most $\tilde O(\sqrt{\phi})$ with high probability, in
$\tilde O(\frac{1}{b}(\frac{1}{\phi} + n))$ rounds, where $b$ is balance of the
cut of given conductance. In particular, to find a sparse cut of constant
balance, our algorithms take $\tilde O(\frac{1}{\phi} + n)$ rounds.
  Our algorithms can also be used to output a {\em local} cluster, i.e., a
subset of vertices near a given source node, and whose conductance is within a
quadratic factor of the best possible cluster around the specified node. Both
our distributed algorithm can work without knowledge of the optimal $\phi$
value and hence can be used to find approximate conductance values both
globally and with respect to a given source node. We also give a lower bound on
the time needed for any distributed algorithm to compute any non-trivial sparse
cut --- any distributed approximation algorithm (for any non-trivial
approximation ratio) for computing sparsest cut will take $\tilde
\Omega(\sqrt{n} + D)$ rounds, where $D$ is the diameter of the graph.

sampling for acquiring inphase and quadrature (I/Q) components of

outputs can be arranged in 2-dimensional data similar to that by Nyquist
sampling. This paper develops a compressive sampling pulse-Doppler (CoSaPD)
processing scheme from the sub-Nyquist samples. The CoSaPD scheme follows
Doppler estimation/detection and range estimation and is conducted on the
sub-Nyquist samples without recovering the Nyquist samples. The Doppler
estimation is realized through spectrum analyzer as in classic processing. The
detection is done on the Doppler bin data. The range estimation is performed
through sparse recovery algorithms on the detected targets and thus the
computational load is reduced. The detection threshold can be set at a low
value for improving detection probability and then the introduced false targets
are removed in the range estimation stage through inherent detection
characteristic in the recovery algorithms. Simulation results confirm our
findings. The CoSaPD scheme with the data at one eighth the Nyquist rate and
for SNR above -25dB can achieve performance of the classic processing with
Nyquist samples.

Considering different approximations for the small scale structure of dark

months. This red photometric noise has an almost perfect gaussian statistics,
to one part in $\sim 10^4$. We also compare the transient weak lensing power
spectrum with the background effects such as the stellar microlensing on
cosmological scales. A quasar lensed by a galaxy or cluster like SDSSJ1004+4112
strong lensing system, with multiple images, is a suitable system for this
study as: (i) using the time-delay method between different images, we can
remove the intrinsic variations of the quasar, and (ii) strong lensing enhances
signals from the transient weak lensing. We also require the images to form at
large angular separations from the center of the lensing structure, in order to
minimize contamination by the stellar microlensing. With long-term monitoring
of quasar strong lensing systems with a 10-meter class telescope, we can
examine the existence of dark microhaloes as the building blocks of dark matter

associated with distributed neural dysconnectivity, leading to strong interest
in using neuroimaging methods to accurately predict disorder status. In this
work, we are specifically interested in a multivariate approach that uses
features derived from whole-brain resting state functional connectomes.
However, functional connectomes reside in a high dimensional space, which
complicates model interpretation and introduces numerous statistical and
computational challenges. Traditional feature selection techniques are used to
reduce data dimensionality, but are blind to the spatial structure of the
connectomes. We propose a regularization framework where the 6-D structure of
the functional connectome is explicitly taken into account via the fused Lasso
or the GraphNet regularizer. Our method only restricts the loss function to be
convex and margin-based, allowing non-differentiable loss functions such as the
hinge-loss to be used. Using the fused Lasso or GraphNet regularizer with the
hinge-loss leads to a structured sparse support vector machine (SVM) with
embedded feature selection. We introduce a novel efficient optimization
algorithm based on the augmented Lagrangian and the classical alternating
direction method, which can solve both fused Lasso and GraphNet regularized SVM
with very little modification. We also demonstrate that the inner subproblems
of the algorithm can be solved efficiently in analytic form by coupling the
variable splitting strategy with a data augmentation scheme. Experiments on
simulated data and resting state scans from a large schizophrenia dataset show
that our proposed approach can identify predictive regions that are spatially
contiguous in the 6-D ""connectome space,"" offering an additional layer of

metal-metal coupling on the alkali-metal sublattice in the {\beta}-pyrochlore

(rattlers) couple to each other more strongly than they couple to the cage
atoms, and that, at 300 K, this coupling is strongest for Cs. We show that this
coupling controls the dominant dynamics in the rattling of these atoms. We
provide preliminary evidence that the rattlers couple to each other primarily
through the T2g mode whereas their coupling to the cage modes occurs through
the T1u mode. Rattler coupling through the T2g mode provides insight into the
trend in spectral broadening from Cs to K. The spectral broadening is inversely
proportional to the strength of the dynamical correlations on the alkali-metal
sublattice which in turn depend on the atomic size of the rattler, decreasing
from Cs to K. Thus, the broadest spectrum exhibited by the K is partly a
consequence of the small size of this rattler which permits a greater range of
motions involving combinations of both correlated and anti-correlated dynamics.
We emphasize that the identification of the somewhat distinct roles of the T1u
and T2g modes in rattler coupling reported in this work is a significant step
towards a complete fundamental mechanism of rattler dynamical coupling in these
osmates. We believe that such a mechanism will have profound implications for a
broad class of cage compounds, including clathrates and skutterudites.

One of the central problems in this area is the problem of identifying
influencers, such that by convincing these users to perform a certain action
(like buying a new product), a large number of other users get influenced to
follow the action. The client of such an application is a marketer who would
target these influencers for marketing a given new product, say by providing
free samples or discounts. It is natural that before committing resources for
targeting an influencer the marketer would be interested in validating the
influence (or network value) of influencers returned. This requires digging
deeper into such analytical questions as: who are their followers, on what
actions (or products) they are influential, etc. However, the current
approaches to identifying influencers largely work as a black box in this
respect. The goal of this paper is to open up the black box, address these
questions and provide informative and crisp explanations for validating the
network value of influencers.
  We formulate the problem of providing explanations (called PROXI) as a
discrete optimization problem of feature selection. We show that PROXI is not
only NP-hard to solve exactly, it is NP-hard to approximate within any
reasonable factor. Nevertheless, we show interesting properties of the
objective function and develop an intuitive greedy heuristic. We perform
detailed experimental analysis on two real world datasets - Twitter and
Flixster, and show that our approach is useful in generating concise and
insightful explanations of the influence distribution of users and that our
greedy algorithm is effective and efficient with respect to several baselines.

fraction of the commonly accepted values of not directly measurable physical
properties. We reproduce the standard double hump SED found in blazar

negligible magnetization in FSRQs, and moderate or large (and uniform)

potential V/r^2 gives rise to the quantum collapse, i.e., nonexistence of the
ground state (GS) when the attraction strength exceeds a critical value (V =
1/8, in the present notation). Recently, we have demonstrated that the quantum
collapse is suppressed, and the GS is restored, if repulsive interactions
between particles in the quantum gas are taken into account, in the mean-field
approximation. This setting can be realized in a gas of dipolar molecules
attracted to the central charge, with dipole-dipole interactions taken into
regard too. Here we analyze this problem for a binary gas. GSs supported by the
repulsive interactions are constructed in a numerical form, as well as by means
of analytical approximations for both miscible and immiscible binary systems.
In particular, the Thomas-Fermi (TF) approximation is relevant if V is large
enough. It is found that the GS of the miscible binary gas, both balanced and
imbalanced, features a weak phase transition at another critical value, V =
1/2. The transition is characterized by an analyticity-breaking change in the
structure of the wave functions at small r. To illustrate the generic character
of the present phenomenology, we also consider the binary system with the
attraction between the species (rather than repulsion), in the case when the
central potential pulls a single component only.

changes associated with this flare. The HMI instrument provides high-quality
Doppler and magnetic maps of the solar disk at 0.5 arcsec spatial scale at a
cadence of 45 s along with imaging spectroscopy. We have identified five
locations of velocity transients in the active region during the flare. These
transient velocity signals are located in and around the flare ribbons as
observed by Hinode in Ca II H wavelength and the footpoints of hard X-ray
enhancement in the energy range 12-25 keV from RHESSI. The changes in shape and
width of two circular polarization states have been observed at the time of
transients in three out of five locations. Forward modeling of the line
profiles shows that the change in atmospheric parameters such as magnetic field
strength, Doppler velocity and source function could explain the observed
changes in the line profiles with respect to the pre-flare condition.

Ha emission in our sample (6/8 galaxies) display significant [CII] line

the Ha+[NII] emitting nebulae and the lowest entropy X-ray emitting plasma. The
entropy profiles of the hot galactic atmospheres show a clear dichotomy, with
the systems displaying extended emission line nebulae having lower entropies
beyond r~1 kpc than the cold-gas-poor systems. We show that while the hot
atmospheres of the cold-gas-poor galaxies are thermally stable outside of their
innermost cores, the atmospheres of the cold-gas-rich systems are prone to
cooling instabilities. This result indicates that the cold gas is produced
chiefly by thermally unstable cooling from the hot phase. We show that cooling
instabilities may develop more easily in rotating systems and discuss an
alternative condition for thermal instability for this case. The hot
atmospheres of cold-gas-rich galaxies display disturbed morphologies indicating
that the accretion of clumpy multiphase gas in these systems may result in
variable power output of the AGN jets, potentially triggering sporadic, larger
outbursts. In the two cold-gas-poor, X-ray morphologically relaxed galaxies of
our sample, NGC 1399 and NGC 4472, powerful AGN outbursts may have destroyed or
removed most of the cold gas from the cores, allowing the jets to propagate and
deposit most of their energy further out, increasing the entropy of the hot
galactic atmospheres and leaving their cores relatively undisturbed.

often regarded as uniform. The apparent distribution of the longitude of
ascending node, $\Omega$, is strongly affected by well-known seasonal effects
in the discovery rate of NEOs. The deviation from the expected
$\pi$-periodicity in the apparent distribution of $\Omega$ indicates that its
intrinsic distribution is slightly enhanced along a mean direction,
$\bar\Omega=111^\circ$; approximately 53% of NEOs have $\Omega$ values within
$\pm90^\circ$ of $\bar\Omega$. We also find that each sub-group of NEOs (Amors,
Apollos and Atens) has different observational selection effects which cause
different non-uniformities in the apparent distributions of their arguments of
perihelion $\omega$, and longitudes of perihelion $\varpi$. For their intrinsic
distributions, our analysis reveals that the Apollo asteroids have non-uniform
$\omega$ due to secular dynamics associated with
inclination-eccentricity-$\omega$ coupling, and the Amors' $\varpi$
distribution is peaked towards the secularly forced eccentricity vector. The
Apollos' $\omega$ distribution is axial, favoring values near 0 and
$180^\circ$; the two quadrants centered at 0 and $180^\circ$ account for 55% of
the Apollos' $\omega$ values. The Amors' $\varpi$ distribution peaks near
$\bar\varpi=4^\circ$; sixty-one percent of Amors have $\varpi$ within
$\pm90^\circ$ of this peak. We show that these modest but statistically
significant deviations from uniform random distributions of angular elements
are owed to planetary perturbations, primarily Jupiter's. It is remarkable that
this strongly chaotic population of minor planets reveals the presence of

interaction of hard partons with a QCD medium as created in ultrarelativistic
heavy-ion (A-A) collisions. Not only can D and B mesons to a reasonable
accuracy be assumed to represent the hadronization of a b or c quark after
passage through the medium, i.e. they explicitly reflect quark-medium
interaction, but also their interaction physics is expected to be different
from light partons traversing a medium: The quark mass restricts radiation
phase space, leading to a reduction of both vacuum and medium induced
radiation, a phenomenon known as the 'dead cone effect'. Due to this difference
in physics, heavy quark interaction with the medium is usually treated in the
leading parton energy loss approximation, whereas the theory of light parton
physics has moved to modeling the full medium-modified shower evolution. In
this work, an attempt is made to create a more unified description of light
parton and heavy quark physics at high P_T by computing charm-medium
interactions in terms of the nuclear suppression factor and back-to-back
correlations using an in-medium shower evolution Monte Carlo (MC) code that is

paper, we make an initial study on Hankel tensors. For each Hankel tensor, we
associate it with a Hankel matrix and a higher order two-dimensional symmetric
tensor, which we call the associated plane tensor. If the associated Hankel
matrix is positive semi-definite, we call such a Hankel tensor a strong Hankel
tensor. We show that an $m$ order $n$-dimensional tensor is a Hankel tensor if
and only if it has a Vandermonde decomposition. We call a Hankel tensor a
complete Hankel tensor if it has a Vandermonde decomposition with positive
coefficients. We prove that if a Hankel tensor is copositive or an even order
Hankel tensor is positive semi-definite, then the associated plane tensor is
copositive or positive semi-definite, respectively. We show that even order
strong and complete Hankel tensors are positive semi-definite, the Hadamard
product of two strong Hankel tensors is a strong Hankel tensor, and the
Hadamard product of two complete Hankel tensors is a complete Hankel tensor. We
show that all the H-eigenvalue of a complete Hankel tensors (maybe of odd
order) are nonnegative. We give some upper bounds and lower bounds for the
smallest and the largest Z-eigenvalues of a Hankel tensor, respectively.
Further questions on Hankel tensors are raised.

identifying and tracking goods and assets. Such identification may be performed
without requiring line-of-sight alignment or physical contact between the RFID
tag and the RFID reader, whilst tracking is naturally achieved due to the short
interrogation field of RFID readers. That is why the reduction in price of the
RFID tags has been accompanied with an increasing attention paid to this
technology. However, since tags are resource-constrained devices sending
identification data wirelessly, designing secure and private RFID
identification protocols is a challenging task. This scenario is even more
complex when scalability must be met by those protocols.
  Assuming the existence of a lightweight, secure, private and scalable RFID
identification protocol, there exist other concerns surrounding the RFID
technology. Some of them arise from the technology itself, such as distance
checking, but others are related to the potential of RFID systems to gather
huge amount of tracking data. Publishing and mining such moving objects data is
essential to improve efficiency of supervisory control, assets management and
localisation, transportation, etc. However, obvious privacy threats arise if an
individual can be linked with some of those published trajectories. The present
dissertation contributes to the design of algorithms and protocols aimed at
dealing with the issues explained above. First, we propose a set of protocols
and heuristics based on a distributed architecture that improve the efficiency
of the identification process without compromising privacy or security.
Moreover, we present a novel distance-bounding protocol based on graphs that is
extremely low-resource consuming. Finally, we present two trajectory
anonymisation methods aimed at preserving the individuals' privacy when their
trajectories are released.

of many classes of random matrices are given. The treatment includes the
problem of moments and the introduction of the Stieltjes transform. Free
probability theory, which evolved from non-commutative operator algebras, is
explained from a probabilistic point of view in order to better fit the
engineering community. For that purpose freeness is defined without reference
to non-commutative algebras. The treatment includes additive and multiplicative
free convolution, the R-transform, the S-transform, and the free central limit
theorem. The replica method developed in statistical physics for the purpose of
analyzing spin glasses is reviewed from the viewpoint of its applications in
communications engineering. Correspondences between free energy and mutual

These analytic tools are applied to the design and the analysis of linear
multiuser detectors, the modelling of scattering in communication channels with
dual antennas arrays, and the analysis of optimal detection for communication

hard state of Galactic black hole transients as their luminosity decreases and
the source moves towards a quiescent state. Recent radio observations indicate
that the jets turn off completely in the soft state, therefore multiwavelength
monitoring of black hole transients are essential to probe the formation of
jets. In this work we conducted a systematic study of all black hole transients
with near infrared and radio coverage during their outburst decays. We
characterized the timescales of changes in X-ray spectral and temporal
properties and also in near infrared and/or in radio emission. We confirmed
that state transitions occur in black hole transients at a very similar
fraction of their respective Eddington luminosities. We also found that the
near infrared flux increase that could be due to the formation of a compact jet
is delayed by a time period of days with respect to the formation of a corona.
Finally, we found a threshold disk Eddington luminosity fraction for the
compact jets to form. We explain these results with a model such that the
increase in the near infrared flux corresponds to a transition from a patchy,
small scale height corona along with an optically thin out flow to a large
scale height corona that allows for collimation of a steady compact jet. We
discuss the timescale of jet formation in terms of transport of magnetic fields
from the outer parts of the disk, and also consider two alternative
explanations for the multiwavelength emission: hot inner accretion flows and
irradiation.

Traditional incentive mechanisms such as the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)
mechanism and its variants are not applicable here. In this paper, to address
these challenges, we propose a behavior based incentive mechanism for crowd
sensing applications with budget constraints by applying sequential all-pay
auctions in mobile social networks (MSNs), not only to consider the effects of
extensive user participation, but also to maximize high quality of the context
based sensing content submission for crowd sensing platform under the budget
constraints, where users arrive in a sequential order. Through an extensive
simulation, results indicate that incentive mechanisms in our proposed
framework outperform the best existing solution.

the normal state of a spin-polarized unitary Fermi gas. Within the framework of
an extended T-matrix approximation, we calculate the single-particle density of
states, as well as the single-particle spectral weight, to show that the
so-called pseudogap phenomenon gradually disappears with increasing the
magnitude of an effective magnetic field. In the highly spin-polarized regime,
the calculated spin-polarization rate as a function of the effective magnetic
field agrees well with the recent experiment on a 6Li Fermi gas. Although this
experiment has been considered to be incompatible with the existence of the
pseudogap in an unpolarized Fermi gas, our result clarifies that the observed
spin-polarization rate in the highly spin-polarized regime and the pseudogap in
the unpolarized limit can be explained in a consistent manner, when one
correctly includes effects of population imbalance on single-particle
excitations. Since it is a crucial issue to clarify whether the pseudogap
exists or not in the BCS (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer)-BEC (Bose-Einstein

useful for the understanding of this strongly interacting fermion system.

introducing recent theoretical advances in the transport coefficients in the

compatibility. The effect of different modulation parameters on computed

proposed to improve compatibility with the observations at Earth after ~2004.
This modified time dependence led to an improved compatibility between computed

for a sample of 107 galaxies from the CALIFA survey. We use the fossil record
to recover the star formation history (SFH) in spheroidal and disk dominated
galaxies with masses from 10$^9$ to 10$^{12}$ M$_\odot$. We derive the half
mass radius, and we find that galaxies are on average 15% more compact in mass
than in light. HMR/HLR decreases with increasing mass for disk galaxies, but is
almost constant in spheroidal galaxies. We find that the galaxy-averaged
stellar population age, stellar extinction, and $\mu$ are well represented by
their values at 1 HLR. Negative radial gradients of the stellar population ages
support an inside-out formation. The larger inner age gradients occur in the
most massive disk galaxies that have the most prominent bulges; shallower age
gradients are obtained in spheroids of similar mass. Disk and spheroidal
galaxies show negative $\mu$ gradients that steepen with stellar mass. In
spheroidal galaxies $\mu$ saturates at a critical value that is independent of
the galaxy mass. Thus, all the massive spheroidal galaxies have similar local
$\mu$ at the same radius (in HLR units). The SFH of the regions beyond 1 HLR
are well correlated with their local $\mu$, and follow the same relation as the
galaxy-averaged age and $\mu$; suggesting that local stellar mass surface
density preserves the SFH of disks. The SFH of bulges are, however, more
fundamentally related to the total stellar mass, since the radial structure of
the stellar age changes with galaxy mass even though all the spheroid dominated
galaxies have similar radial structure in $\mu$. Thus, galaxy mass is a more
fundamental property in spheroidal systems while the local stellar mass surface
density is more important in disks.

that a system can explore. This change has unavoidable thermodynamic
implications. According to Boltzmann's microscopic interpretation of entropy, a
shrinkage of the set of compatible states implies a decrease of entropy, which
eventually needs to be compensated by dissipation of heat and consequently
requires work. Examples are the compression of a gas and the erasure of
information. On the other hand, in a spontaneous SB, the available phase space
volume changes without the need for work, yielding an apparent decrease of
entropy. Here we show that this decrease of entropy is a key ingredient in the
Szilard engine and Landauer's principle and report on a direct measurement of
the entropy change along SB transitions in a Brownian particle. The SB is
induced by a bistable potential created with two optical traps. The experiment
confirms theoretical results based on fluctuation theorems, allows us to
reproduce the Szilard engine extracting energy from a single thermal bath, and
shows that the signature of a SB in the energetics is measurable, providing new
methods to detect, for example, the coexistence of metastable states in
macromolecules.

consensus-building process hardly succeeds due to lack of face and standing.
The evolution of cooperation in this type of situation is studied using
threshold public good games in which cooperation prevails when it is initially
sufficient, or otherwise, it perishes. While punishment is a powerful tool to
shape human behaviours, institutional punishment is often too costly to start
with only a few contributors, which is another coordination problem. Here we
show that whatever the initial conditions, reward funds based on voluntary
contribution can evolve. The voluntary reward paves the way for effectively
overcoming the coordination problem and efficiently transforms freeloaders to
cooperators with a perceived small risk of collective failure.

parameters, which resulted in compatible intensities along Voyager 1, were
assumed along the Voyager 2 trajectory, the model failed to reproduce the

alone could not reproduce the cosmic ray observations along Voyager 2 so that
changes to the heliospheric geometry were necessary i.e the computed
intensities along both Voyager trajectories suggest that the heliosphere is
asymmetric. Furthermore, $E >$ 70 MeV and 133-242 MeV proton intensities along

become clearer. Initial masses of their components were successfully estimated
by Y{\i}ld{\i}z and Do\u{g}an using a new method mainly based on observational
properties of overluminous secondary components. In this paper, we continue to
discuss the results and make computations for age and orbital evolution of
these binaries. It is shown that the secondary mass, according to its
luminosity, also successfully predicts the observed radius. While the current
mass of the primary component is determined by initial masses, the current
secondary mass is also a function of initial angular momentum. We develop
methods to compute the age of A- and W-subtype W UMa-type contact binaries {in
terms of} initial masses and mass according to the luminosity of the
secondaries. Comparisons of our results with the mean ages from kinematic
properties of these binaries and data pertaining to contact binaries in open
and globular clusters, have increased our confidence on this method. The mean
ages of both A- and W-subtype contact binaries are found as 4.4 and 4.6 Gyr,
respectively. From kinematic studies, these ages are given as 4.5 and 4.4 Gyr,
respectively. We also compute orbital properties of A-subtype contact binaries
at the time of the first overflow. Initial angular momentum of these binaries
is computed by comparing them with the well-known detached binaries. The
angular momentum loss rate derived in the present study for the detached phase
is in very good agreement with the semi-empirical rates available in the
literature. In addition to the limitations on the initial masses of W UMa-type
contact binaries, it is shown that the initial period of these binaries is less

brain. Previously, researchers surmised that a single general concept may act
as a unifying underlying generative mechanism, with the theory of self
organized criticality being a weighty contender.
  Consequently, a substantial amount of effort has gone into developing new and
extended models and, hitherto, three classes of models have emerged. The first
line of models is based on a separation between the time scales of drive and
dissipation, and includes the original sandpile model and its extensions, like
the dissipative earthquake model. Within this approach the steady state is
close to criticality in terms of an absorbing phase transition. The second line
of models is based on external drives and internal dynamics competing on
similar time scales and includes the coherent noise model, which has a
non-critical steady state characterized by heavy-tailed distributions. The
third line of models proposes a non-critical self-organizing state, being
guided by an optimization principle, such as the concept of highly optimized
tolerance.
  We present a comparative overview regarding distinct modeling approaches
together with a discussion of their potential relevance as underlying
generative models for real-world phenomena. The complexity of physical and
biological scaling phenomena has been found to transcend the explanatory power
of individual paradigmal concepts. The interaction between theoretical
development and experimental observations has been very fruitful, leading to a

compounds, where \textit{A} is an alkali, have led to consider that Bardeen
Cooper Schrieffer (BCS) electron-phonon pairing prevails in those compounds,
though the incidence of electronic Coulomb repulsion has been highly debated.
The discovery of two isomeric fulleride compounds Cs$_{3}$C$_{60}$ which
exhibit a transition with pressure from a Mott insulator (MI) to a
superconducting (SC) state clearly re-opens that question. Using pressure ($p$)
as a single control parameter of the C$_{60}$ balls lattice spacing, one can
now study the progressive evolution of the SC properties when the electronic
correlations are increased towards the critical pressure $p_{c}$ of the Mott
transition. We have used $^{13}$C and $^{133}$Cs NMR measurements on the cubic
phase A15-Cs$_{3}$C$_{60}$ just above $p_{c}=5.0(3)$ kbar, where the SC
transition temperature $T_{c}$ displays a dome shape with decreasing cell
volume. From the $T$ dependence below $T_{c}$ of the nuclear spin lattice
relaxation rate $(T_{1})^{-1}$ we determine the electronic excitations in the
SC state, that is $2\Delta$, the SC gap value. We find that $2\Delta $
increases with decreasing $p$ towards $p_{c}$, where $T_{c}$ decreases on the
SC dome, so that $2\Delta /k_{B}T_{c}$ increases regularly upon approaching the
Mott transition. These results bring clear evidence that the increasing
correlations near the Mott transition are not significantly detrimental to SC.
They rather suggest that repulsive electron interactions might even reinforce
elecron-phonon SC, being then partly responsible for the large $T_{c}$ values,
as proposed by theoretical models taking the electronic correlations as a key
ingredient.

We observed 37 sources within 250 Mpc that were selected by high X-ray
luminosity (L_X > 10^40 W) and high absorbing column density (N_H ~ 10^22
cm^-2). Sources also included dual or triple AGN and interacting systems. We
further included objects detected in hydroxyl (OH). The selection consisted of
16 new sources, 13 previous non-detections to follow up with a factor ten
higher sensitivity, 10 OH masers and one deep OH absorber, of which 37 were
observed. Water megamasers were detected towards the Sy 2 galaxy 2MFGC 13581 (a
disk-maser), towards the 6 GHz OH absorber NGC 4261 (3C 270 with a twin-jet and
dusty torus; broad water maser emission), and towards the two 1.6 GHz OH maser
sources IRAS 17526+3253 and IRAS 20550+1656 (possible star formation water
masers). We set upper limits on 33 non-detections. The search increased the
number of known ""dual-species"" objects containing both OH and H2O masers to
eight. The detection rate was 25 % in OH galaxies and 11 % overall. Combined
with other searches, a total of 95 objects have now been searched for both OH
and H2O masers. We found the overall dual-species detection rate (8 in 95) to
be of the order of the joint probability of both species independently
occurring in the same object (1 % lower bound). However, this needs to be
verified by a more detailed analysis of selection criteria. Lastly, we see a
lack of H2O kilomasers in OH megamaser objects already noted by Tarchi et al.

modifications of viruses, poses major challenges to our health care systems.
This means that tools that can efficiently and specifically diagnose viruses

centers, such tools should be relatively cheap and easy to use. Here we discuss
the biophysical potential for the macroscopic detection of viruses based on the
induction of a mechanical stress in a bundle of pre-stretched DNA molecules
upon binding of viruses to the DNA. We show that the affinity of the DNA to the
charged virus surface induces a local melting of the double-helix into two
single-stranded DNA. This process effects a mechanical stress along the DNA
chains leading to an overall contraction of the DNA. Our results suggest that
when such DNA bundles are incorporated in a supporting matrix such as a
responsive hydrogel, the presence of viruses may indeed lead to a significant,
macroscopic mechanical deformation of the matrix. We discuss the biophysical
basis for this effect and characterize the physical properties of the
associated DNA melting transition. In particular, we reveal several scaling
relations between the relevant physical parameters of the system. We promote
this DNA-based assay for efficient and specific virus screening.

Considering the large volume limit of the CY, in which the non-perturbative
corrections are exponentially suppressed, we define a new class of solutions
which turn out to be genuinely quantum, in the sense that not only their
classical limit is not well defined, but also the truncation under
consideration becomes inconsistent in such a limit. Next, we construct the
first non-extremal black hole solution with non-constant scalars in the
presence of perturbative corrections. Right after, restricting ourselves to the
case of self-mirror CY, we study the case in which the sub-dominant
contribution has a non-perturbative origin, obtaining the first family of
explicit supersymmetric solutions of this kind. Surprisingly enough, these
solutions turn out to involve multivalued functions, which opens the door for a
possible violation of the No-Hair conjecture. We discuss how this cannot be

the union of the exterior wedge regions. The existence of such a state was
first conjectured by Hartle and Hawking (1976) and Israel (1976) for stationary

Wald (1991), who considered a general bifurcate Killing horizon and proved that
a certain (large) subalgebra of the free field algebra admits at most one
Hadamard state which is invariant under the Killing flow. In the presence of a
wedge reflection this state reduces to a pure, quasi-free KMS state on the
smaller subalgebra associated to one of the exterior wedge regions. Our result
establishes the existence of such a state on the full algebra in the static
case. Our proof follows the arguments of Sewell (1982) and Jacobson (1994),
exploiting a Wick rotation in the Killing time coordinate to construct a
corresponding Euclidean theory. Because the Killing time coordinate is
ill-defined on the bifurcation surface we systematically replace it by a
Gaussian normal coordinate. A crucial part of our proof is to establish that
the Euclidean ground state satisfies the necessary analogs of analyticity and
reflection positivity with respect to this coordinate.

an increasing need for a declarative language that can permit business users to
specify complex event-processing rules. Such rules should be able to correlate
different event streams, detect absence of events (negative information),
permit aggregations over sliding windows, specify dependent sliding windows
etc. For instance it should be possible to precisely state a rule such as
""Every seventh trading session that DowJones has risen consecutively, and IBM's
stock is off 3% over its average in this period, evaluate IBM position"",
""Declare the sensor as faulty if no reading has been received for 500 ms"", etc.
Further, the language should be implementable efficiently in an event-driven
fashion.
  We propose the Timed (Default) Concurrent Constraint, TCC, programming
framework as a foundation for such complex event processing. While very rich,
the TCC framework ""forgets"" information from one instant to the next. We make
two extensions. First, we extend the TCC model to carry the store from previous
time instants as ""past"" information in the current time instant. This permits
rules to to be written with rich queries over the past. Second, we show that
many of the powerful properties of the agent language can be folded into the
query language by permitting agents and queries to be defined mutually
recursively, building on the testing interpretation of intuitionistic logic
described in RCC \cite{radha-fsttcs05}. We show that this permits queries to
move ""back and forth"" in the past, e.g.{} ""Order a review if the last time that
IBM stock price dropped by 10% in a day, there was more than 20% increase in
trading volume for Oracle the following day.""

however, hampers their applicability in cases where the likelihood model is
costly to evaluate, or where large numbers of particles are required to
represent the posterior. We introduce the approximate sequential importance
sampling/resampling (ASIR) algorithm, which aims at reducing the cost of
traditional particle filters by approximating the likelihood with a mixture of
uniform distributions over pre-defined cells or bins. The particles in each bin
are represented by a dummy particle at the center of mass of the original
particle distribution and with a state vector that is the average of the states
of all particles in the same bin. The likelihood is only evaluated for the
dummy particles, and the resulting weight is identically assigned to all
particles in the bin. We derive upper bounds on the approximation error of the
so-obtained piecewise constant function representation, and analyze how bin
size affects tracking accuracy and runtime. Further, we show numerically that
the ASIR approximation error converges to that of sequential importance
sampling/resampling (SIR) as the bin size is decreased. We present a set of
numerical experiments from the field of biological image processing and
tracking that demonstrate ASIR's capabilities. Overall, we consider ASIR a
promising candidate for simple, fast particle filtering in generic

family of spin representations of the two-boundary Temperley-Lieb algebra.
These spin representations have three different appearances. Their original

matchmaker representations they relate to Temperley-Lieb loop models in
statistical physics, while their realization as principal series

initial mass function (IMF) in massive elliptical galaxies. Here we investigate
the influence of the IMF shape on the recently discovered color-magnitude
relation (CMR) among globular clusters (GCs) in such galaxies. To this end we
use calculations of GC mass loss due to stellar and dynamical evolution to
evaluate (i) the shapes of stellar mass functions in GCs after 12 Gyr of
evolution as a function of current GC mass along with their effects on
integrated-light colors and mass-to-light ratios, and (ii) their impact on the
effects of GC self-enrichment using the 2009 `reference' model of Bailin &
Harris. As to the class of metal-poor GCs, we find the observed shape of the
CMR (often referred to as the `blue tilt') to be very well reproduced by Bailin
& Harris' reference self-enrichment model once 12 Gyr of GC mass loss is taken
into account. The influence of the IMF on this result is found to be
insignificant. However, we find that the observed CMR among the class of
metal-rich GCs (the `red tilt') can only be adequately reproduced if the IMF
was bottom-heavy (e.g., $-3.0 <~ \alpha <~ -2.3$ in $dN/dM \propto
M^{\alpha}$), which causes the stellar mass function at subsolar masses to
depend relatively strongly on GC mass. This constitutes additional evidence

We show that these estimability issues can be taken into account at the design
stage, through the definition of suitable design criteria. Extensions of $E$-,
$c$- and $G$-optimality criteria are considered, which when evaluated at a
given $\theta ^0$ (local optimal design), account for the behavior of the model
response $\eta(\theta )$ for $\theta$ far from $\theta ^0$. In particular, they
ensure some protection against close-to-overlapping situations where
$\|\eta(\theta )-\eta(\theta ^0)\|$ is small for some $\theta$ far from $\theta
^0$. These extended criteria are concave and necessary and sufficient
conditions for optimality (equivalence theorems) can be formulated. They are
not differentiable, but when the design space is finite and the set $\Theta$ of
admissible $\theta$ is discretized, optimal design forms a linear programming
problem which can be solved directly or via relaxation when $\Theta$ is just
compact. Several examples are presented.

$w$ is defined on the nanostructured samples that, in turn, induces a lateral

period and in-plane applied field, thin and thick regions switch independently

anisotropy induced by the periodic thickness modulation. However, as the

the nucleation of topological defects at the interfaces between thin and thick

irrespective of the selection technique and only very mildly depending on the
star forming rate, the clustering lengths of these objects present a sharp
increase of about a factor 3 between z~1 and z~2, going from values of ~5 Mpc
to about 15 Mpc and higher. This behaviour is reflected in the trend of the
masses of the dark matter hosts of star-forming galaxies which increase from
~10^11.5 Msun to ~10^13.5 Msun between z~1 and z~2. Our analysis shows that
galaxies which actively form stars at high redshifts are not the same
population of sources we observe in the more local universe. In fact, vigorous
star formation in the early universe is hosted by very massive structures,
while for z~1 a comparable activity is encountered in much smaller systems,
consistent with the down-sizing scenario. The available clustering data can
hardly be reconciled with merging as the main trigger for intense star
formation activity at high redshifts.
  We further argue that, after a characteristic time-scale of ~1 Gyr, massive
star-forming galaxies at z>~2 evolve into z<~1.5 passive galaxies with large

Anderson, bifurcation from nonlinear dynamics, Landau's theory of phase
transition, and the mechanism of emergent rare events studied by Kramers, we
introduce a possible framework for understanding mesoscopic dynamics that links
(i) fast lower level microscopic motions, (ii) movements within each basin at
the mid-level, and (iii) higher-level rare transitions between neighboring
basins, which have rates that decrease exponentially with the size of the
system. In this mesoscopic framework, multiple attractors arise as emergent
properties of the nonlinear systems. The interplay between the stochasticity
and nonlinearity leads to successive jump-like transitions among different
basins. We argue each transition is a dynamic symmetry breaking, with the
potential of exhibiting Thom-Zeeman catastrophe as well as phase transition
with the breakdown of ergodicity (e.g., cell differentiation). The slow-time
dynamics of the nonlinear mesoscopic system is not deterministic, rather it is
a discrete stochastic jump process. The existence of these discrete states and
the Markov transitions among them are both emergent phenomena. This emergent
stochastic jump dynamics then serves as the stochastic element for the
nonlinear dynamics of a higher level aggregates on an even larger spatial and
slower time scales (e.g., evolution). This description captures the
hierarchical structure outlined by Anderson and illustrates two distinct types
of limit of a mesoscopic dynamics: A long-time ensemble thermodynamics in terms
of time $t$ tending infinity followed by the size of the system $N$ tending
infinity, and a short-time trajectory steady state with $N$ tending infinity
followed by $t$ tending infinity. With these limits, symmetry breaking and cusp
catastrophe are two perspectives of the same mesoscopic system on different
time scales.

intrinsic regime, where $I_c$ scales linearly with the inverse of the pulse
length, and a long-time thermally assisted regime where $I_c$ varies weakly.
Both regimes are consistent with magnetization reversal proceeding by
nucleation and fast propagation of domains. We find that $I_c$ is a factor 3-4

negligibly small, which is a hallmark feature of spin-orbit torques.

computationally limited. It is therefore important to make efficient use of
available computational resources, notably by minimizing the number of
templates used to cover the signal parameter space of sky position and
frequency evolution. For searches over the sky, however, the required template
density (determined by the parameter-space metric) is different at each sky
position, which makes it difficult in practice to achieve an efficient
covering. Previous work on this problem has found various choices of sky and
frequency coordinates that render the parameter-space metric approximately
constant, but which are limited to coherent integration times of either less
than a few days, or greater than several months. These limitations restrict the
sensitivity achievable by hierarchical all-sky searches, and hinder the
development of follow-up pipelines for interesting gravitational-wave pulsar
candidates. We present a new flat parameter-space metric approximation, and
associated sky and frequency coordinates, that do not suffer from these
limitations. Furthermore, the new metric is numerically well-conditioned, which

  Applications","12 pages, also submitted to PVLDB",,,,"cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  Large-scale distributed graph-parallel computing is challenging. On one hand,
due to the irregular computation pattern and lack of locality, it is hard to
express parallelism efficiently. On the other hand, due to the scale-free
nature, real-world graphs are hard to partition in balance with low cut. To
address these challenges, several graph-parallel frameworks including Pregel
and GraphLab (PowerGraph) have been developed recently. In this paper, we
present an alternative framework, Graph Runtime Engine (GRE). While retaining
the vertex-centric programming model, GRE proposes two new abstractions: 1) a
Scatter-Combine computation model based on active message to exploit massive
fined-grained edge-level parallelism, and 2) a Agent-Graph data model based on
vertex factorization to partition and represent directed graphs. GRE is
implemented on commercial off-the-shelf multi-core cluster. We experimentally
evaluate GRE with three benchmark programs (PageRank, Single Source Shortest
Path and Connected Components) on real-world and synthetic graphs of millions
billion of vertices. Compared to PowerGraph, GRE shows 2.5~17 times better
performance on 8~16 machines (192 cores). Specifically, the PageRank in GRE is
the fastest when comparing to counterparts of other frameworks (PowerGraph,
Spark,Twister) reported in public literatures. Besides, GRE significantly
optimizes memory usage so that it can process a large graph of 1 billion
vertices and 17 billion edges on our cluster with totally 768GB memory, while
PowerGraph can only process less than half of this graph scale.

interest, since it can not only accommodate large numbers of users, but also
handle peer heterogeneity. However, there's still a lack of comprehensive
studies on chunk scheduling for the smooth playout of layered streams in P2P
networks. In these situations, a playout smoothing mechanism can be used to
ensure the uniform delivery of the layered stream. This can be achieved by
reducing the quality changes that the stream undergoes when adapting to
changing network conditions. This paper complements previous efforts in
throughput maximization and delay minimization for P2P streaming by considering
the consequences of playout smoothing on the scheduling mechanisms for stream
layer acquisition. The two main problems to be considered when designing a
playout smoothing mechanism for P2P streaming are the fluctuation in available
bandwidth between peers and the unreliability of user-contributed
resources--particularly peer churn. Since the consideration of these two
factors in the selection and scheduling of stream layers is crucial to maintain

  Communication Links and Networks (CAMAD), Barcelone : Spain (2012)",,,,"cs.NI cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There is an increasing demand for P2P streaming in particular for layered
video. In this category of applications, the stream is composed of
hierarchically encoded sub-streams layers namely the base layer and
enhancements layers. We consider a scenario where the receiver peer uses the
pull-based approach to adjust the video quality level to their capability by
subscribing to different number of layers. We note that higher layers received
without their corresponding lower layers are considered as useless and cannot
be played, consequently the throughput of the system will drastically degrade.
To avoid this situation, we propose an economical model based on auction
mechanisms to optimize the allocation of sender peers' upload bandwidth. The
upstream peers organize auctions to ""sell"" theirs items (links' bandwidth)
according to bids submitted by the downstream peers taking into consideration
the peers priorities and the requested layers importance. The ultimate goal is
to satisfy the quality level requirement for each peer, while reducing the
overall streaming cost. Through theoretical study and performance evaluation we
show the effectiveness of our model in terms of users and network's utility.

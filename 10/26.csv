analogies, both at the phenomenological and at the methodological level,
between the subcritical transition to turbulence and the glass transition.
Having recalled the phenomenology of the subcritical transition to turbulence,
we review the theories of the glass transition at a very basic level, focusing
on the history of their development as well as on the concepts they have
elaborated. Doing so, we aim at attracting the attention on the above mentioned
analogies, which we believe could inspire new developments in the theory of the
subcritical transition to turbulence. We then briefly describe a model inspired
by one of the simplest and most inspiring model of the glass transition, the
so-called Random Energy Model, as a first step in that direction.

transport by moving periodic potentials produced by surface acoustic waves
(SAWs). The potential modulation induced by the SAW strain modifies both the
band gap and the electrostatic field in the quantum wells confining the IX,
leading to changes in their energy. In addition, this potential capture and
transports IXs over several hundreds of {\mu}m. While the IX packets keep to a
great extent their spatial shape during transport by the moving potential, the
effective transport velocity is lower than the SAW group velocity and increases
with the SAW amplitude. This behavior is attributed to the capture of IXs by
traps along the transport path, thereby increasing the IX transit time. The
experimental results are well-reproduced by an analytical model for the
interaction between trapping centers and IXs during transport.

compounds, where A is an alkali ion, has been initially ascribed to a BCS
mechanism, with a weak incidence of electron correlations. However various
experimental evidences taken for compounds with distinct alkali content
established the interplay of strong correlations and Jahn Teller distortions of
the C60 ball. The importance of electronic correlations even in A3C60 has been
highlighted by the recent discovery of two expanded fulleride Cs3C60 isomeric
phases that are Mott insulators at ambient pressure. Both phases undergo a
pressure induced first order Mott transition to SC with a (p, T) phase diagram
displaying a dome shaped SC, a common situation encountered nowadays in
correlated electron systems. NMR experiments allowed us to establish that the
bipartite A15 phase displays N\'eel order at 47K, while magnetic freezing only
occurs at lower temperature in the fcc phase. NMR data do permit us to conclude
that well above the critical pressure, the singlet superconductivity found for
light alkalis is recovered. However deviations from BCS expectations linked
with electronic correlations are found near the Mott transition. So, although
SC involves an electron-phonon mechanism, correlations have a significant
incidence on the electronic properties, as had been anticipated from DMFT
calculations.

theorems about the quantitative relation between these versions: the first
theorem concerns a variation of a known fact with a new proof, the second
theorem and its proof are new. We select the above version of logical depth and
show the following. There is an infinite sequence of strings of increasing
length such that for each $j$ there is a $b$ such that the logical depth of the
$j$th string as a function of $j$ is incomputable (it rises faster than any
computable function) but with $b$ replaced by $b+1$ the resuling function is
computable. Hence the maximal gap between the logical depths resulting from
incrementing appropriate $b$'s by 1 rises faster than any computable function.
All functions mentioned are upper bounded by the Busy Beaver function. Since
for every string its logical depth is nonincreasing in $b$, the minimal
computation time of the shortest programs for the sequence of strings as a
function of $j$ rises faster than any computable function but not so fast as
the Busy Beaver function.

computationally less demanding and significantly faster than shape comparison

of action-to-a-distance interaction potentials. Relativistic corrections to the
classical Langevin equation emerge as nonlinear dissipation terms and originate
from the nonlinear dependence of the relativistic velocity on momentum. On the
other hand, similar nonlinear dissipation forces also appear as classical
(non-relativistic) corrections to the weak-coupling approximation. It is shown
that these classical corrections, which are usually ignored in phenomenological
models, may be of the same order of magnitude, if not larger than relativistic
ones. The interplay of relativistic corrections and classical
beyond-the-weak-coupling contributions determines the sign of the leading
nonlinear dissipation term in the Langevin equation, and thus is qualitatively
important.

relatively rapid structure formation in $f(R)$ gravity boosts the non-linear

$\Om_K$ its ring of integers. Let $\Gamma$ be a congruence subgroup of
$\SL_2(\Om_K)$ and $M_{(k_1,k_2)}(\Gamma)$ the space of Hilbert modular forms
of weight $(k_1,k_2)$ for $\Gamma$. The first main result is an algorithm to
construct a finite set $S$, depending on $K$, $\Gamma$ and $(k_1,k_2)$, such
that if the Fourier expansion coefficients of a form $G \in
M_{(k_1,k_2)}(\Gamma)$ vanish on the set $S$, then $G$ is the zero form. The
second result corresponds to the same statement in the Sturm case, i.e. suppose
that all the Fourier coefficients of the form $G$ lie in a finite extension of
$\Q$, and let $\id{p}$ be a prime ideal in such extension, whose norm is
unramified in $K$; suppose furthermore that the Fourier expansion coefficients
of $G$ lie in the ideal $\id{p}$ for all the elements in $S$, then they all lie
in the ideal $\id{p}$.

generated by humans from digital media such as cameras, internet, phones,

predict many things about the user such as behavior, interest etc. However
before one can use the data, one has to address many issues for big data
storage. Two main issues are the need of large storage devices and the cost
associated with it. Synthetic DNA storage seems to be an appropriate solution
to address these issues of the big data. Recently in 2013, Goldman and his
collegues from European Bioinformatics Institute demonstrated the use of the
DNA as storage medium with capacity of storing 2.2 peta bytes of information on
one gram of DNA and retrived the data successfully with low error rate. This
significant step shows a promise for synthetic DNA storage as a useful
technology for the future data storage. Motivated by this, we have developed a
software called DNACloud which makes it easy to store the data on the DNA. In
this work, we present detailed description of the software.

non-minimal Universal Extra Dimension (nmUED) with an orbifolded (S1/Z2) flat
extra spatial dimension in the presence of brane-localized terms (BLTs). In
general, BLTs affect the masses and the couplings of the KK excitations in a
non-trivial way including those for the KK top quarks. On top of that, BLTs
also influence the mixing of the top quark chiral states at each KK level and
trigger mixings among excitations from different levels with identical KK
parity (even or odd). The latter phenomenon of mixing of KK levels is not
present in the popular UED scenario known as the minimal UED (mUED) at the tree
level. Of particular interest are the mixings among the KK top quarks from
level `0' and level `2' (driven by the mass of the Standard Model (SM) top
quark). These open up new production modes in the form of single production of
a KK top quark and the possibility of its direct decays to Standard Model (SM)
particles leading to rather characteristic signals at the colliders.
Experimental constraints and the restrictions they impose on the nmUED
parameter space are discussed. The scenario is implemented in MadGraph 5 by
including the quark, lepton, the gauge-boson and the Higgs sectors up to the
second KK level. A few benchmark scenarios are chosen for preliminary studies
of the decay patterns of the KK top quarks and their production rates at the
LHC in various different modes. Recast of existing experimental analyzes in
scenarios having similar states is found to be not so straightforward for the
KK top quarks of the nmUED scenario under consideration.

network architecture that combines the advantages of ""massive MIMO"" and ""small

server via a wired backhaul network and acting as a large distributed antenna
system. We focus on the downlink, which is both more demanding in terms of
traffic and more challenging in terms of implementation than the uplink. In
order to enable multiuser joint precoding of the downlink signals, channel
state information at the transmitter side is required. We consider Time
Division Duplex (TDD), where the {\em downlink} channels can be learned from
the user uplink pilot signals, thanks to channel reciprocity. Furthermore,
coherent multiuser joint precoding is possible only if the APs maintain a
sufficiently accurate relative timing and phase synchronization. AP
synchronization and TDD reciprocity calibration are two key problems to be
solved in order to enable distributed MU-MIMO downlink. In this paper, we
propose novel over-the-air synchronization and calibration protocols that scale
well with the network size. The proposed schemes can be applied to networks
formed by a large number of APs, each of which is driven by an inexpensive
802.11-grade clock and has a standard RF front-end, not explicitly designed to
be reciprocal. Our protocols can incorporate, as a building block, any suitable
timing and frequency estimator. Here we revisit the problem of joint ML timing
and frequency estimation and use the corresponding Cramer-Rao bound to evaluate
the performance of the synchronization protocol. Overall, the proposed
synchronization and calibration schemes are shown to achieve sufficient
accuracy for satisfactory distributed MU-MIMO performance.

thought to have been spun up by disc accretion, with magnetic linkage between
the star and the disc playing a key role. Their spin history depends
sensitively on details of the magnetic field structure, but idealized models
from the 1980s and 1990s are still commonly used for calculating the magnetic
field components. This paper is the third in a series presenting results from a
step-by-step analysis which we are making of the problem, starting with very
simple models and then progressively including additional features one at a
time, with the aim of gaining new insights into the mechanisms involved. In our
first two papers, the magnetic field structure in the disc was calculated for a
standard Shakura and Sunyaev model, by solving the magnetic induction equation
numerically in the stationary limit within the kinematic approximation; here we
consider a more general velocity field in the disc, including backflow. We find
that the profiles of the poloidal and toroidal components of the magnetic field
are fairly similar in the two cases but that they can be very different from
those in the models mentioned above, giving important consequences for the
torque exerted on the central object. In particular we find that, contrary to
what is usually thought, some regions of the disc outward of the co-rotation
point (rotating more slowly than the neutron star) may nevertheless contribute
to spinning up the neutron star on account of the detailed structure of the
magnetic field in those parts of disc.

have higher star formation rates than the galaxies without detected H$\alpha$,
and we may still be missing the most dust-obscured progenitors.

in the dwarf satellite galaxy of M81: NGC 2976, using multiwavelength archival
observations. The galaxy is known to present kinematic evidence for a
bysimmetric distortion, anyhow the stellar bar presence is controversial, due
to the possible interpretation of NGC 2976 presenting an elliptical disk
triggered by a prolate dark matter halo. We applied diagnostics in order to
detect stellar bars or spiral arms. The m=2 fourier phase has a jump around 60
arcsecs consistent with a central bar and bisymmetric arms. The CO, 3.6 $\mu$
surface brightness and the dust lanes are consistent with a gas rich central
bar and possibly with gaseous spiral arms. The kinematic jumps related with the
dust lanes suggest that the bar perturbation in the disk kinematics is
non-negligible and the reported non-circular motions, the central gas excess
and the nuclear X-ray source (AGN/Starburst) might be produced by the central
bar. SPH simulations of disks inside triaxial dark halos suggest that the two
symmetric spots at 130 arcsecs and the narrow arms may be produced by gas at
turning points in an elliptical disk, alternatively the potential ellipticity
can be originated by tidally induced strong stellar bar/arms. We conclude that,
the gas rich bar and spiral arms triggered by tidal stirring, and primordial
halo triaxiality, can explain most of the non-circular motions, mass
redistribution and nuclear activity. Distinguishing between them requires
detailed modeling of environmental effects. An analysis similar to this may
reveal such kind of structures in other nearby dwarf satellite galaxies, and if
confirmed, the same evolutionary scenario will be applicable to them. This
implies biases constraining their dark matter distribution and also making
comparison against theoretical predictions for isolated galaxies.

pc by deep radio surveys. One explanation has been that hyperstrong temporal
scattering prevents pulsar detections, but the recent discovery of radio
pulsations from a highly magnetized neutron star (magnetar) within 0.1 pc shows
that the temporal scattering is much weaker than predicted. We argue that an
intrinsic deficit in the ordinary pulsar population is the most likely reason
for the lack of detections to date: a ""missing pulsar problem"" in the Galactic
center. In contrast, we show that the discovery of a single magnetar implies
efficient magnetar formation in the region. If the massive stars in the central
parsec form magnetars rather than ordinary pulsars, their short lifetimes could
explain the missing pulsars. Efficient magnetar formation could be caused by
strongly magnetized progenitors, or could be further evidence of a top-heavy
initial mass function. Furthermore, current high-frequency surveys should
already be able to detect bright millisecond pulsars, given the measured degree

percent level measurements of the CMB lensing power. This necessitates tight
control of systematic biases. We study several types of biases to the
temperature-based lensing reconstruction signal from foreground sources such as
radio and infrared galaxies and the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect from
galaxy clusters. These foregrounds bias the CMB lensing signal due to their
non-Gaussian nature. Using simulations as well as some analytical models we
find that these sources can substantially impact the measured signal if left
untreated. However, these biases can be brought to the percent level if one
masks galaxies with fluxes at 150 GHz above 1 mJy and galaxy clusters with
masses above M_vir = 10^14 M_sun. To achieve such percent level bias, we find
that only modes up to a maximum multipole of l_max ~ 2500 should be included in
the lensing reconstruction. We also discuss ways to minimize additional bias
induced by such aggressive foreground masking by, for example, exploring a
two-step masking and in-painting algorithm.

limited by quasi-static speckle noise and ADI is commonly used to suppress
those speckles. However, the application of ADI can result in self-subtraction
of the disk signal due to the disk's finite spatial extent. This signal
attenuation varies with radial separation and biases measurements of the disk's
surface brightness, thereby compromising inferences regarding the physical
processes responsible for the dust distribution. To compensate for this
attenuation, we forward-model the disk structure and compute the form of the
self-subtraction function at each separation. As a proof of concept, we apply
our method to 1.6 and 2.2 micron Keck AO NIRC2 scattered-light observations of

brightness that was otherwise lost to self-subtraction and produce simplified
models of the brightness distribution as it appears with and without
self-subtraction. From the latter models, we extract radial profiles for the
disk's brightness, width, midplane position, and color that are unbiased by
self-subtraction. Our analysis of these measurements indicates a break in the
brightness profile power law at r~110 AU and a disk width that increases with
separation from the star. We also verify disk curvature that displaces the

are various reasons why the spectrum may be different for different sources,

the most efficient stages of acceleration. We show how the spectrum at the
accelerator translates to the spectrum that make up the escaping cosmic rays
that replenish the Galactic pool of cosmic rays. We assume that cosmic ray
confinement, and thus escape, is linked to the level of magnetic field
amplification, and that the magnetic field is amplified by streaming cosmic
rays according to the non-resonant hybrid or resonant instability. When a fixed
fraction of the energy is transferred to cosmic rays, it turns out that a
source spectrum that is flatter than $E^{-2}$ will result in a $E^{-2}$ escape

deliver a detection of cosmological emission, their limited sensitivity will
prevent them from providing detailed information about the astrophysics of
reionization. In this work, we consider what types of measurements will be
enabled by a next-generation of larger 21 cm EoR telescopes. To calculate the
type of constraints that will be possible with such arrays, we use simple
models for the instrument, foreground emission, and the reionization history.
We focus primarily on an instrument modeled after the $\sim 0.1~\rm{km}^2$
collecting area Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) concept design, and
parameterize the uncertainties with regard to foreground emission by
considering different limits to the recently described ""wedge"" footprint in
k-space. Uncertainties in the reionization history are accounted for using a
series of simulations which vary the ionizing efficiency and minimum virial
temperature of the galaxies responsible for reionization, as well as the mean
free path of ionizing photons through the IGM. Given various combinations of
models, we consider the significance of the possible power spectrum detections,
the ability to trace the power spectrum evolution versus redshift, the
detectability of salient power spectrum features, and the achievable level of
quantitative constraints on astrophysical parameters. Ultimately, we find that
$0.1~\rm{km}^2$ of collecting area is enough to ensure a very high significance
($\gtrsim30\sigma$) detection of the reionization power spectrum in even the
most pessimistic scenarios. This sensitivity should allow for meaningful
constraints on the reionization history and astrophysical parameters,
especially if foreground subtraction techniques can be improved and
successfully implemented.

been found to exhibit a remarkably broad emission feature above 4 keV, with
inferred equivalent widths up to 2 keV. Such a feature was first detected
during the X-ray flaring activity associated with the giant outburst that the
source experienced in 1999 September. The extraordinarily large equivalent
width line was then ascribed to reflection/reprocessing of fluorescent Fe
emission within an extended optically thick outflow enshrouding the binary
system as a result of a short-lived, super-Eddington accretion episode. Making
use of new and archival X-ray observations, we show here that a similar feature
persists over four orders of magnitude in luminosity, down to Eddington ratios
as low as log(L_Edd) = -4.5, where the existence of an optically thick envelope
appears at odds with any viable accretion flow model. Possible interpretations
for this highly unusual X-ray spectrum include a blend of Doppler
shifted/boosted Fe lines from unresolved X-ray jets (a la SS433), or, the first
Galactic analog of a blazar spectrum, where the >4 keV emission would
correspond to the onset of the Inverse Compton hump. Either requires a low
inclination angle of the jet with respect to the line of sight, in agreement
with the estimates for the 1999 superluminal jet (i_jet<10 deg). The fast
variability of the feature, combined with the high orbital axis inclination (60
deg< i_orb<71 deg), argue for a rapidly precessing accretion flow around V4641
Sgr, possibly leading to a transient microblazar behavior.

collapse supernovae as major producers of dust, here we calculate the
hydrodynamics of the matter reinserted within young and massive super stellar
clusters under the assumption of gas and dust radiative cooling. The large
supernova rate expected in massive clusters allows for a continuous
replenishment of dust immersed in the high temperature thermalized reinserted
matter and warrants a stationary presence of dust within the cluster volume
during the type II supernova era. We first show that such a balance determines
the range of dust to gas mass ratio and this the dust cooling law. We then
search for the critical line that separates stationary cluster winds from the
bimodal cases in the cluster mechanical luminosity (or cluster mass) vs cluster
size parameter space. In the latter, strong radiative cooling reduces
considerably the cluster wind mechanical energy output and affects particularly
the cluster central regions, leading to frequent thermal instabilities that
diminish the pressure and inhibit the exit of the reinserted matter. Instead
matter accumulates there and is expected to eventually lead to gravitational
instabilities and to further stellar formation with the matter reinserted by
former massive stars. The main outcome of the calculations is that the critical
line is almost two orders of magnitude or more, depending on the assumed value
of the adiabatic wind terminal speed, lower than when only gas radiative
cooling is applied. And thus, many massive clusters are predicted to enter the
bimodal regime.

superconductivity in radiofrequency (RF) fields can be separated by applying
two RF modes simultaneously to a superconducting surface. We develop a simple
model that illustrates how mode-mixing RF data can be related to properties of
the superconductor. Within our model the data can be described by a single
parameter, which can be derived either from RF or thermometry data. Our RF and
thermometry data are in good agreement with the model. We propose to use
mode-mixing technique to decouple thermal and magnetic effects on RF breakdown
of superconductors.

massive embedded stars as well as several notable interstellar structures. In
this research, our goals were to determine the role of magnetic fields and to
study the size distribution of interstellar dust particles within this
turbulent environment. We have used a set of optical and near-infrared
polarimetric data obtained at OPD/LNA (Brazil) and CTIO (Chile), correlated
with extinction maps, 2MASS data and images from DSS and Spitzer. The region's
most striking feature is a swept out interstellar cavity whose polarimetric
maps indicate that magnetic field lines were dragged outwards, pilling up along
its borders. This led to a higher magnetic strength value ($\approx400\,\mu$G)
and an abrupt increase in polarization degree, probably due to an enhancement
in alignment efficiency. Furthermore, dense cloud fragmentations with peak
$A_{V}$ between 20 and 37 mag were probably triggered by its expansion. The
presence of $24\,\mu$m point-like sources indicates possible newborn stars
inside this dense environment. A statistical analysis of the angular dispersion
function revealed areas where field lines are aligned in a well-ordered
pattern, seemingly due to compression effects from the HII region expansion.
Finally, Serkowski function fits were used to study the ratio of the
total-to-selective extinction, reveling a dual population of anomalous grain
particles sizes. This trend suggests that both effects of coagulation and
fragmentation of interstellar grains are present in the region.

the general case of $N$-partite systems. While such states do not generally

generalizations of X states in larger systems, since they appear to always be
EPU-equivalent to general states of all ranks, whereas literal X states
generally are not. An example of this is given for $2\times 3$, including the
proposition of the $2\times 3$ maximally entangled mixed states (MEMS). If the

be computable in a simpler form by using the EPU-equivalence between general

(WIMP interactions and phase-space distribution) from direct-detection data in
the early discovery days when multiple experiments see of order dozens to
hundreds of events. To demonstrate the essential complementarity of different
direct-detection experiments in this context, we create mock data intended to
represent the data from the near-future Generation 2 experiments. We consider
both conventional supersymmetry-inspired benchmark points (with
spin-independent and -dependent elastic cross sections just below current
limits), as well as benchmark points for other classes of models (inelastic and
effective-operator paradigms). We also investigate the effect on parameter
estimation of loosening or dropping the assumptions about the local WIMP
phase-space distribution. We arrive at two main conclusions. Firstly, teasing
out WIMP physics with experiments depends critically on having a wide set of
detector target materials, spanning a large range of target nuclear masses and
spin-dependent sensitivity. It is also highly desirable to obtain data from
low-threshold experiments. Secondly, a general reconstruction of the local WIMP
velocity distribution, which will only be achieved if there are multiple
experiments using different target materials, is critical to obtaining a robust
and unbiased estimate of the WIMP mass.

the authors, revisiting the problem of range measurement based localization of

comes from the non-convex structure of optimization tasks associated with range
measurements, noting that the set of source locations corresponding to a
certain distance measurement by a fixed point sensor is non-convex both in two
and three dimensions. Differently from various recent approaches to this
localization problem, all starting with a non-convex geometric minimization
problem and attempting to devise methods to compensate the non-convexity
effects, we suggest a geometric strategy to compose a convex minimization
problem first, that is equivalent to the initial non-convex problem, at least
in noise-free measurement cases. Once the convex equivalent problem is formed,
a wide variety of convex minimization algorithms can be applied. The paper also
suggests a gradient based localization algorithm utilizing the introduced
convex cost function for localization. Furthermore, the effects of measurement
noises are briefly discussed. The design, analysis, and discussions are
supported by a set of numerical simulations.

Although many efforts have been devoted to develop efficient solvers, it
remains challenging to apply SVM to large-scale problems. A nice property of
SVM is that the non-support vectors have no effect on the resulting classifier.
Motivated by this observation, we present fast and efficient screening rules to
discard non-support vectors by analyzing the dual problem of SVM via
variational inequalities (DVI). As a result, the number of data instances to be
entered into the optimization can be substantially reduced. Some appealing
features of our screening method are: (1) DVI is safe in the sense that the
vectors discarded by DVI are guaranteed to be non-support vectors; (2) the data
set needs to be scanned only once to run the screening, whose computational
cost is negligible compared to that of solving the SVM problem; (3) DVI is
independent of the solvers and can be integrated with any existing efficient
solvers. We also show that the DVI technique can be extended to detect
non-support vectors in the least absolute deviations regression (LAD). To the
best of our knowledge, there are currently no screening methods for LAD. We
have evaluated DVI on both synthetic and real data sets. Experiments indicate
that DVI significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art screening
rules for SVM, and is very effective in discarding non-support vectors for LAD.
The speedup gained by DVI rules can be up to two orders of magnitude.

parameters of the Weibull reliability model, is discussed in a technological
context. The meaning of the priors as expression of virtual data samples is
analyzed. The implications of physics of failures are also highlighted. The
whole analysis shows a rational way to convert a really available technological
knowledge into prior information, effectively and without a long elicitation
process. A large Monte Carlo study, on both complete and censored samples of
small size, shows the good properties of some estimators, which can exploit
such a new approach.

the paper, we illustrate this statement by analysis foreshocks preceding the

triggers that cause the critical transitions. The analysis shows a sharp
increase of foreshock activity 3 h before the mainshock. This result is
reminiscent of the well-known activation of the ULF magnetic precursors of
earthquakes. Furthermore, we found that the characteristic frequency of

consistent with a prediction of the catastrophe theory. Finally, the analysis
testifies that the strong foreshocks seems may be triggers of mainshocks. The
idea is that the surface waves propagating outwards from the foreshock return
back to the vicinity of the epicenter after having made a complete revolution
around the Earth and induce there the mainshock.

high-energy neutrinos may oscillate resonantly from one flavor to another

Sge-type outbursts also generally follow this trend. There are some objects

including BK Lyn which made a transition from an ER UMa-type state to the
novalike (standstill) state in 2013 and unusually frequent occurrence of
superoutbursts in NY Ser and CR Boo. We applied least absolute shrinkage and
selection operator (Lasso) power spectral analysis, which has been proven to be
very effective in analyzing the Kepler data, to ground-based photometry of BK
Lyn and detected the dramatic disappearance of the signal of negative
superhumps in 2013. We suggested that the mass-transfer rates did not vary

of the active neutrinos, the second sterile has mass of order eV and the
heaviest one is in the keV range. In the present scenario, the short baseline
anomaly is explained through $\Delta m^2\sim 1\, {\rm eV^2}$, the depletion of
muon neutrino flux in IceCube is explained through $\Delta m^2\sim 4.0\times
10^{-16}\, {\rm eV^2}$ and the dark matter problem is addressed through $\Delta
m^2\sim 1\, {\rm keV^2}$. Our proposed mixing matrix is also compatible with
the observed neutrino oscillation data. We show that the high energy muon and
the tau neutrino fluxes from Gamma Ray Bursts can be depleted in IceCube by as
much as 38% and 43% respectively. These substantial depletion in both muon and
tau neutrino fluxes is due to their small but sizable mixing with the sterile
neutrinos.

was the highest ever recorded since space age. It is the purpose of this paper
to resolve the most plausible mechanism for this unusually high intensity. A
GCR transport model in three-dimensional heliosphere based on a simulation of
Markov stochastic process is used to find the relation of cosmic ray modulation
to various transport parameters, including solar wind (SW) speed, distance of
heliospheric boundary, magnitude of interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) at the
Earth, tilt angle of heliospheric current sheet (HCS), values of parallel and
perpendicular diffusion coefficients. We calculate GCR proton energy spectra at
the Earth for the last three solar minima $P_{21/22}$, $P_{22/23}$, and
$P_{23/24}$, with the transport parameters obtained from observations. Besides
weak IMF magnitude and slow SW speed, we find that a possible low magnetic
turbulence, which increases the parallel diffusion and reduces the
perpendicular diffusion in the polar direction, might be an additional possible
mechanism for the high GCR intensity in the solar minimum $P_{23/24}$.

systems on chip. This leads to a generalization of the concept of nonlinear
figure of merit (NFOM) to a vector of coefficients. In addition, by considering
unconstrained signal, pump and idler resonance coupling strengths to excitation
ports, not usually available in simple cavity geometry, we show that the
efficiency-maximizing design will have unequal external Q for the three

normalized solution to the design problem in the presence of nonlinear loss in
terms of optimum choice of coupling. Based on the results, we suggest a family
of coupled-cavity systems to implement optimum FWM, where control of resonant

cellular plasticity in cancer stem cell populations compared to ordinary cancer
cells. Importantly, network entropy also allows identification of key
differentiation pathways. Our results are consistent with the view that
pluripotency is a statistical property defined at the cellular population
level, correlating with intra-sample heterogeneity, and driven by the degree of
signaling promiscuity in cells. In summary, network entropy provides a
quantitative measure of a cell's undifferentiated state, defining its elevation

elasticity for a doubly periodic mass-spring elastic lattice. The notion of
logarithmically growing resonant waves is used in a complete analysis of
star-shaped wave forms induced by an oscillating point force. We note that the
dispersion surfaces for Floquet-Bloch waves in an elastic lattice main contain
critical points of the saddle type. Based on the local quadratic approximations
of the frequency, as a function of wave vector components, we deduce properties
of a transient asymptotic solution as the contribution of the point source to
the wave form. In this way, we describe local Green's functions as localized
wave forms corresponding to the resonant frequency. The peculiarity of the
problem lies in the fact that, at the same resonant frequency, the Taylor
quadratic approximations for different groups of the resonant points are
different, and hence we deal with different local Green's functions. Thus,
there is no uniformly defined homogenisation procedure for a given resonant
frequency. Instead, the continuous approximation of the wave field can be
obtained through the asymptotic analysis of the lattice Green's functions.

some specific characteristics with a complex gas and dusty disk including

retrieved archival images obtained at Gemini in the near IR (Ks band) with the

unprecedented resolution, while the large-scale structure of the disk is mostly

images is now resolved into a multi-armed spiral pattern. Using two models of a
gravitational perturber orbiting in a gaseous disk we attempted to bring
constraints on the characteristics of this perturber assuming each spiral being
independent and we derived qualitative conclusions. The non-detection of the
northeast spiral pattern observed in HST allows to put a lower limit on the
intensity ratio between the two sides of the disk, which if interpreted as
forward scattering yields a larger anisotropic scattering than derived in the

adsorption measurements and a combination of in-situ infrared spectroscopy and

Theoretical calculations including van der Waals interactions (based on vdW-DF)
suggest that two adsorption configurations are possible for these SO$_2$
molecules. One geometry involves an SO$_2$ molecule bonded through its sulfur
atom to the oxygen atom of the paddle-wheel building unit and its two oxygen
atoms to the C-H groups of the organic linkers by formation of hydrogen bonds.
Such a configuration results in a distortion of the benzene rings, which is
consistent with the experimentally observed shift of the ring deformation mode.
In the other geometry, SO$_2$ establishes hydrogen bonding with -CH$_2$ group
of the ted linker through its two oxygen atoms simultaneously. The
vdW-DF-simulated frequency shifts of the SO$_2$ stretching bands in these two
configurations are similar and in good agreement with spectroscopically
measured values of physisorbed SO$_2$.In addition, the IR spectra reveal the
presence of another minor species, characterized by stretching modes at 1242
and 1105 cm$^{-1}$ and causing significant perturbations of MOFs vibrational
modes (CH$_x$ and carboxylate groups). This species is more strongly bound,
requiring a higher temperature ($\sim$150 $^\circ$C) to remove it than for the

of a general Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM). The analysis is relevant to a
future $e^+e^-$ or $\mu^+\mu^-$ collider operating at center of mass energy of
$\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV. Two different scenarios of small and large $\alpha$ values
is studied. Here $\alpha$ is the parameter which diagonalizes the neutral
CP-even Higgs boson mass matrix. Within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model (MSSM), cross section of this process is almost the same at $e^+e^-$ and
$\mu^+\mu^-$ colliders. It is shown that at $e^+e^-$ colliders within a general
2HDM, cross section is not sensitive to the mass of neutral Higgs bosons,
however, it can acquire large values up to several picobarn at $\mu^+\mu^-$
colliders with the presence of heavy neutral Higgs bosons. A scan over Higgs
boson mass parameter space is performed to analyze the effect of large masses
of neutral Higgs bosons involved in the s-channel propagator and thus in the
total cross section of this process.

radial velocity measurements are polluted by a systematic annual variation

purging this variation, the residuals still contain a clear signature of an
additional $\sim 1100$ days periodicity. The latter variation leaves
significant hints in all three independent radial velocity subsets that we
analysed: the CORALIE data, the Keck data acquired prior to a hardware upgrade,
and the Keck data taken after the upgrade.
  We mainly treat this variation as a signature of a third planet in the

stellar activity. We find it easy to naturally obtain a stable three-planet
radial-velocity fit close to the three-planet mean-motion resonance 1:2:5, with
the two main planets (those in the 1:2 resonance) in an aligned apsidal

distribution are efficient in scattering near- and mid-infrared radiation.
These wavelengths are therefore particularly well suited to probe the still
uncertain high-end of the size distribution. Aims. We investigate the change in
appearance of a typical low-mass molecular core from the Ks (2.2 micron) band
to the Spitzer IRAC 3.6 and 8 micron bands, and compare with model
calculations, which include variations of the grain size distribution. Methods.
We combine Spitzer IRAC and ground-based near-infrared observations to
characterize the scattered light observed at the near- and mid-infrared
wavelengths from the core L260. Using a spherical symmetric model core, we
perform radiative transfer calculations to study the impact of various dust
size distributions on the intensity profiles across the core. Results. The
observed scattered light patterns in the Ks and 3.6 micron bands are found to
be similar. By comparison with radiative transfer models the two profiles place
constraints on the relative abundance of small and large (more than 0.25
micron) dust grains. The scattered light profiles are found to be inconsistent
with an interstellar silicate grain distribution extending only to 0.25 micron
and large grains are needed to reach the observed fluxes and the flux ratios.
The shape of the Ks band surface brightness profile limits the largest grains
to 1-1.5 micron. Conclusions. In addition to observing coreshine in the Spitzer
IRAC channels, the combination with ground-based near-infrared observations are
suited to constrain the properties of large grains in cores.

or based on fitting selected properties of nuclei in specific mass regions, are
widely used inputs to shell-model studies of nuclei. Until recently, most
shell-model calculations have been confined to a single oscillator shell.
Recent interest in nuclei away from the stability line, requires however larger
shell-model spaces. Since the derivation of microscopic effective interactions
has been limited to degenerate model spaces, there are both conceptual and
practical limits to present shell-model calculations that utilize such
interactions. Purpose: The aim of this work is to present a novel microscopic
method to calculate effective interactions for the nuclear shell model. Its
main difference from existing theories is that it can be applied not only to
degenerate model spaces but also to non-degenerate model spaces. Methods: The
formalism is presented in the form of many-body perturbation theory based on
the recently developed Extended Kuo-Krenciglowa method. Our method enables us
to microscopically construct effective interactions not only in one oscillator
shell but also for several oscillator shells. Results: We present numerical
results using effective interactions within (i) a single oscillator shell like
the sd-shell and the pf-shell, and (ii) two major shells like the sdf7p3-shell
and the pfg9-shell. We also present energy levels of several nuclei which have
two valence nucleons on top of a given closed-shell core. Conclusions: Our
results show that the present method works excellently in shell-model spaces
that comprise several oscillator shells, as well as in a single oscillator
shell. We show in particular that the microscopic inter-shell interactions are
much more attractive than has been expected by degenerate perturbation theory.
The consequences for shell-model studies are discussed.

Depending on the relative transparencies of the junctions, the resonance can
increase or reduce the conductance, and it can even vanish for $\varphi=\pi$,
featuring total reflection of quasiparticles at $NS_1$ by the ABS at $S_1S_2$.

investigate the intrinsic carrier mobility ({\mu}) of monolayer MoS2 sheet and
nanoribbons. In contrast to the dramatic three orders of magnitude of
deterioration of {\mu} in graphene upon forming nanoribbons, the magnitude of
{\mu} in armchair MoS2 nanoribbons is comparable to that in monolayer MoS2
sheet, albeit oscillating with width. Surprisingly, a room-temperature
transport polarity reversal is observed with {\mu} of hole (h) and electron (e)
being 200.52 (h) and 72.16 (e) cm2V-1s-1 in sheet, and 49.72 (h) and 190.89 (e)
cm2V-1s-1 in 4 nm-wide nanoribbon. The robust magnitudes of {\mu} and polarity
reversal are attributable to the different characteristics of edge states
inherent in MoS2 nanoribbons. Our study suggests that width-reduction together
with edge engineering provide a promising route for improving the transport
properties of MoS2 nanostructures.

(communication in the presence of side information). Adapting a technique of
Beigi, we show that such coding requires existence of a set of vectors
satisfying orthogonality conditions related to suitably defined graphs $G$ and
$H$. Such vectors exist if and only if $\vartheta(\overline{G}) \le
\vartheta(\overline{H})$ where $\vartheta$ represents the Lov\'asz number. We
also obtain similar inequalities for the related Schrijver $\vartheta^-$ and
Szegedy $\vartheta^+$ numbers.
  These inequalities reproduce several known bounds and also lead to new
results. We provide a lower bound on the entanglement assisted cost rate. We
show that the entanglement assisted independence number is bounded by the
Schrijver number: $\alpha^*(G) \le \vartheta^-(G)$. Therefore, we are able to
disprove the conjecture that the one-shot entanglement-assisted zero-error
capacity is equal to the integer part of the Lov\'asz number. Beigi introduced
a quantity $\beta$ as an upper bound on $\alpha^*$ and posed the question of
whether $\beta(G) = \lfloor \vartheta(G) \rfloor$. We answer this in the
affirmative and show that a related quantity is equal to $\lceil \vartheta(G)
\rceil$. We show that a quantity $\chi_{\textrm{vect}}(G)$ recently introduced
in the context of Tsirelson's conjecture is equal to $\lceil
\vartheta^+(\overline{G}) \rceil$.

way to determine habitability of some environment is to compare its certain

We know that some locations in our Solar System provide at least some of these
limits and criteria. This article describes the aims and technical
specifications of some planetary missions, such as NASAs MSL in 2012, ESAs
ExoMars missions in 2016 and 2018, and JUICE in 2033. These missions will
explore habitability of Mars, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. Here we compare
defined habitability criteria to instrumentation documentation to determine
whether these missions could validate the habitability of Mars and those Jovian
moons. These missions have about 13 habitability assessment related instruments
for Mars, 3 for Europa, 5 for Ganymede and Callisto. I conclude that these
missions will yield important information for habitability assessment of these

non-critical level curves interpolate smoothly between the critical level

needs only understand the finitely many critical level curves of $f$. In this

geometrically but conformally by the configuration of critical level curves.
That is, if $f_1$ and $f_2$ have the same configuration of critical level
curves, then there is a conformal map $\phi$ such that $f_1\equiv
f_2\circ\phi$. We then show that every configuration of critical level curves

the Gauss--Lucas theorem to rational functions) using level curves.

modeled as a set of coupled Gaussian multiple-access channels. The objective of
the network is not to reconstruct individual sensor readings at designated
fusion centers but rather to reliably compute some functions thereof. Our
particular attention is on real-valued functions that can be represented as a
post-processed sum of pre-processed sensor readings. Such functions are called
nomographic functions and their special structure permits the utilization of
the interference property of the Gaussian multiple-access channel to reliably
compute many linear and nonlinear functions at significantly higher rates than
those achievable with standard schemes that combat interference. Motivated by
this observation, a computation scheme is proposed that combines a suitable
data pre- and post-processing strategy with a nested lattice code designed to
protect the sum of pre-processed sensor readings against the channel noise.
After analyzing its computation rate performance, it is shown that at the cost
of a reduced rate, the scheme can be extended to compute every continuous
function of the sensor readings in a finite succession of steps, where in each
step a different nomographic function is computed. This demonstrates the
fundamental role of nomographic representations.

biological, chemical and ecological systems which is of great significance in
many applications, such as the evolution of new species or complex chemical
organizations. In this paper, we propose a competitive model with a m-selection
rule in which an abrupt emergence of a macroscopic independent ACS is observed.
By numerical simulations, we find that the maximal increase of the size grows
linearly with the system size. We analytically derive the threshold t{\alpha}
where the abrupt jump happens and verify it by simulations. Moreover, our
analysis explains how this giant independent ACS grows and reveals that, as the
selection rule becomes more strict, the phase transition is dramatically
postponed, and the number of the largest independent ACSs coexisting in the
system increases accordingly. Our research work deepens the understanding of
the evolution of ACS and should provide useful information for designing
strategies to control the emergence of ACS in corresponding applications.

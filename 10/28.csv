gas-tracing CS(1-0) transition towards the young gamma-ray-bright supernova
remnant, RXJ1713.7-3946 (SNR G347.3-0.5). In a hadronic gamma-ray emission
scenario, where cosmic ray protons interact with gas to produce the observed
gamma-ray emission, the mass of potential cosmic ray target material is an
important factor. We summarise newly-discovered dense gas components, towards
Cores G and L, and Clumps N1, N2, N3 and T1, which have masses of 1-10^4 solar
masses. We argue that these components are not likely to contribute
significantly to gamma-ray emission in a hadronic gamma-ray emission scenario.
This would be the case if RXJ1713.7-3946 were at either the currently favoured
distance of ~1kpc or an alternate distance (as suggested in some previous
studies) of ~6kpc.
  This survey also targeted the shock-tracing SiO molecule. Although no SiO
emission corresponding to the RXJ1713.7-3946 shock was observed,
vibrationally-excited SiO(1-0) maser emission was discovered towards what may
be an evolved star. Observations taken one year apart confirmed a transient
nature, since the intensity, line-width and central velocity of
SiO(J=1-0,v=1,2) emission varied significantly.

Specifically, we consider a degeneracy of the bifurcation equations that
creates a small bubble in parameter space in which stable small-amplitude
patterned states may exist near two Turing bifurcations. Pattern transitions
between these bifurcation points can then be analyzed in a weakly nonlinear
framework. We find that a number of transition scenarios besides the standard

any particular pattern or sequence as a precursor to vegetation collapse.
Additionally, we find that clues to the robustness of the standard sequence lie
in the nonlinear details of a particular model.

borrowing strength across spatial region or by considering multiple outcomes
simultaneously. We provide here two formulations to perform small area
estimation with Fay-Herriot models that include both multivariate outcomes and
latent spatial dependence. We consider two model formulations, one in which the
outcome-by-space dependence structure is separable and one that accounts for
the cross dependence through the use of a generalized multivariate conditional
autoregressive (GMCAR) structure. The GMCAR model is shown in a state-level
example to produce smaller mean square prediction errors, relative to
equivalent census variables, than the separable model and the state-of-the-art
multivariate model with unstructured dependence between outcomes and no spatial

two types of spin-orbit terms, the so-called Dirac term which induces out-of

polarization. We show that for some parameters of the Fermi energy, the beam
splitter device built on 2D TIs can achieve higher in-plane spin polarization
than one built on materials described by the Rashba model itself. Further, due
to high tunability of the electron density and the asymmetry of the quantum
well, spin polarization in different directions can be obtained. While in the
normal (topologically trivial) regime the in-plane spin polarization would
dominate, in the inverted regime the out-of-plane polarization is more
significant not only in the band gap but also for small Fermi energies above
the gap. Further, we suggest a double beam splitter scheme, to measure in-plane

HgTe/CdTe quantum wells, this scheme could be also promising for InAs/GaSb QWs

summing of some independent low-resolution images formulated from overlapping

SAR imaging, where the samples are collected at sub-Nyquist rate, the data
spectrum is highly aliased that hinders the direct application of the existing

inverse of multilook procedures, which is then combined with random sampling
matrix to yield a multilook CS-SAR observation model. Then a joint sparse
regularization model, considering pixel dependency of subimages, is derived to
form multilook images. The suggested SAR imaging method can not only
reconstruct sparse scene efficiently below Nyquist rate, but is also able to
achieve a comparable reduction of speckles during reconstruction. Simulation

grids of massive stellar evolution models (Geneva, STERN, Padova and FRANEC
codes). We first investigate the effects of overshooting, mass loss,
metallicity, chemical composition. We subsequently focus on rotation. Finally,
we compare the predictions of published evolutionary models with the observed
properties of a large sample of Galactic stars. We find that all models agree
well for the main sequence evolution. Large differences in luminosity and
temperatures appear for the post main sequence evolution, especially in the
cool part of the HR diagram. Depending on the physical ingredients, tracks of
different initial masses can overlap, rendering any mass estimate doubtful. For
masses between 7 and 20 Msun, we find that the main sequence width is slightly
too narrow in the Geneva models including rotation. It is (much) too wide for
the (STERN) FRANEC models. This conclusion is reached from the investigation of
the HR diagram and from the evolution of the surface velocity as a function of
surface gravity. An overshooting parameter alpha between 0.1 and 0.2 in models
with rotation is preferred to reproduce the main sequence width. Determinations
of surface abundances of carbon and nitrogen are partly inconsistent and cannot
be used at present to discriminate between the predictions of published tracks.
For stars with initial masses larger than about 60 Msun, the FRANEC models with
rotation can reproduce the observations of luminous O supergiants and WNh
stars, while the Geneva models remain too hot.

$C(G,G)$, the set of all continuous functions from $G$ to $G$, and with the
compact- open topology inherited from C(G,G) is a left topological monoid. The
group of units of $S_G$, which is denoted by $H(1)$, is isomorphic to a
subgroup of the group of all bijection map from $G$ to $G$ under composition of
functions. Moreover, it is proved that $H(1)$ is embedded in the group of all
invertible linear operators on $C(G)$, the set of all complex continuous
function on $G$.

GGG is often used to define the conditional hydration contribution of X. This
quantity or the hydration thermodynamics of a small molecule analog of the
side-chain or some combination of such estimates, have anchored the
interpretation of seminal experiments on protein stability and folding. We show
that such procedures to model protein hydration have significant limitations.
We study the conditional hydration thermodynamics of the isoleucine side-chain
in an extended pentapeptide and in helical deca-peptides, using as appropriate
an extended penta-glycine or appropriate helical deca-peptides as reference.
Hydration of butane in the gauche conformation provides a small molecule
reference for the side-chain. We use the quasichemical theory to parse the
hydration thermodynamics into chemical, packing, and long-range interaction
contributions. The chemical contribution reflects the contribution of solvent
clustering within the defined inner-shell of the solute; the chemical
contribution of g-butane is substantially more negative than the conditional
chemical contribution of isoleucine. The packing contribution gives the work
required to create a cavity in the solvent, a quantity of interest in
understanding hydrophobic hydration. The packing contribution for g-butane
substantially overestimates the conditional packing of isoleucine. The net of
such compensating contributions still disagrees with the conditional free
energy of isoleucine but by a lesser magnitude. The excess enthalpy and entropy
of hydration of g-butane model are also more negative than the corresponding
conditional quantities for the side-chain. The conditional solvation of
isoleucine in GGIGG also proves unsatisfactory in describing the conditional
solvation of isoleucine in the helical peptides.

  We perform a study which generalizes to a non-hilbertian setting and to the

linearized Boltzmann operator. We first give a precise localization of the
spectrum, which consists in an essential part lying on the left of the
imaginary axis and a discrete spectrum, which is also of nonnegative real part

inelastic ""dispersion relations"", and compute an expansion of the branches of
eigenvalues of the linear operator, for small Fourier (in space) frequencies
and small inelasticity.
  One of the main novelty in this work, apart from the study of the inelastic
case, is that we consider an exponentially weighted $L^1(m^{-1})$ Banach

case, endorsed with Gaussian weights. We prove in particular that the results

strategy to detect an intelligent Invader who wants to utilize spectrum
undetected for his/her unapproved purposes. To deal with this problem we apply
game-theoretical tools. We model the situation as a game between a Scanner and
an Invader where the Invader faces a dilemma: the more bandwidth the Invader
attempts to use leads to a larger payoff if he is not detected, but at the same
time also increases the probability of being detected and thus fined.
Similarly, the Scanner faces a dilemma: the wider the bandwidth scanned, the
higher the probability of detecting the Invader, but at the expense of
increasing the cost of building the scanning system. The equilibrium strategies
are found explicitly and reveal interesting properties. In particular, we have
found a discontinuous dependence of the equilibrium strategies on the network
parameters, fine and the type of the Invader's award. This discontinuity on
fine means that the network provider has to take into account a human factor
since some threshold values of fine could be very sensible for the Invader,
while in other situations simply increasing the fine has minimal deterrence
impact. Also we show how different reward types for the Invader (e.g. motivated
by using different type of application, say, video-streaming or downloading
files) can be incorporated into scanning strategy to increase its efficiency.

are responsible for tumorigenesis while a larger body of ""passenger"" mutations
occurs in the tumor but does not progress the disease. Due to recent
pharmacological successes in treating cancers caused by driver mutations, a
variety of of methodologies that attempt to identify such mutations have been
developed. Based on the hypothesis that driver mutations tend to cluster in key
regions of the protein, the development of cluster identification algorithms
has become critical.
  Results: We have developed a novel methodology, SpacePAC (Spatial Protein
Amino acid Clustering), that identifies mutational clustering by considering
the protein tertiary structure directly in 3D space. By combining the
mutational data in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) and
the spatial information in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), SpacePAC is able to
identify novel mutation clusters in many proteins such as FGFR3 and CHRM2. In
addition, SpacePAC is better able to localize the most significant mutational
hotspots as demonstrated in the cases of BRAF and ALK. The R package is
available on Bioconductor at:

  Conclusion: SpacePAC adds a valuable tool to the identification of mutational
clusters while considering protein tertiary structure

Arbitrary-Eulerian-Lagrangian (ALE) one-step ADER-WENO finite volume schemes
for the solution of nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws on two-dimensional
unstructured triangular meshes. High order of accuracy in space is achieved by
a WENO reconstruction algorithm, while a local space-time Galerkin predictor
allows the schemes to be high order accurate also in time by using an
element-local weak formulation of the governing PDE on moving meshes. The mesh
motion can be computed by choosing among three different node solvers, which
are for the first time compared with each other in this article: the node
velocity may be obtained i) either as an arithmetic average among the states
surrounding the node, or, ii) as a solution of multiple one-dimensional
half-Riemann problems around a vertex, or, iii) by solving approximately a
multidimensional Riemann problem around each vertex of the mesh using the
genuinely multidimensional HLL Riemann. Once the vertex velocity and thus the
new node location has been determined by the node solver, the local mesh motion
is then constructed by straight edges connecting the vertex positions at the
old time level with the new ones at the next time level. If necessary, a
rezoning step can be introduced here to overcome mesh tangling or highly
deformed elements. We apply the high order algorithm presented in this paper to
the Euler equations of compressible gas dynamics as well as to the ideal
classical and relativistic MHD equations. We show numerical convergence results
up to fifth order of accuracy in space and time together with some classical
numerical test problems for each hyperbolic system under consideration.

compensated derivatives is presented which yields constraint-free
semidefiniteness results for any differentiable, constrained optimization

extremum principle, be it a physical system subject to the minimum action
principle, the equilibrium point of a game theoretical problem expressible as
an extremum, or a problem of decision theory with incomplete information
treated by the maximum entropy principle. The method of generalized compensated
derivatives is natural and powerful, and its underlying structure has a simple
and intuitively appealing geometric interpretation. Several extensions of the
main theorem such as envelope relations, symmetry properties and invariance
conditions, transformations of decision variables and parameters, degrees of
arbitrariness in the choice of comparative statics results, and rank relations
and inequalities are developed. The relationship of the new method to existing
formulations is established, thereby providing a unification of the main
differential comparative statics methods currently in use. A second theorem is
also established which yields exhaustive, constraint-free comparative statics
results for a general, constrained optimization problem. This theorem subsumes
all other comparative statics formulations. The method is illustrated with a
variety of models, some well known, such as profit and utility maximization,
where several novel extensions and results are derived, and some new, such as
the principal-agent problem, the efficient portfolio problem, a model of a

highest transverse energy. We find good agreement between data and standard
model background expectations and measure the combined cross section for WW,
WZ, and ZZ production to be $13.8^{+3.0}_{-2.7}$ pb. No significant anomalies

related to age in a variety of tissue types. After not finding many age-related
genes in some of the analyzed tissue types, the study was criticized for having
low power. It is possible that the low power is due to the presence of
important unmeasured variables, and indeed we find that a latent factor model
appears to explain substantial variability not captured by measured covariates.
We propose including the estimated latent factors in a multiple regression
model. The key difficulty in doing so is assigning appropriate degrees of
freedom to the estimated factors to obtain unbiased error variance estimators
and enable valid hypothesis testing. When the number of responses is large
relative to the sample size, treating the estimated factors like observed
covariates leads to a downward bias in the variance estimates. Many ad-hoc
solutions to this problem have been proposed in the literature without the
backup of a careful theoretical analysis. Using recent results from random
matrix theory, we derive a simple, easy to use expression for degrees of
freedom. Our estimate gives a principled alternative to ad-hoc approaches in
common use. Extensive simulation results show excellent agreement between the
proposed estimator and its theoretical value. Applying our methodology to the
AGEMAP genomics study, we found an order of magnitude increase in the number of
significant genes. Although we focus on the AGEMAP study, the methods developed
in this paper are widely applicable to other multivariate models, and thus are
of independent interest.

of the brain's sensory, cognitive, emotional and motor capacities. Neural
processes are seldom simultaneous but occur according to precise temporal and
coordinative choreographies within and between brains. Methods with good
temporal resolution such as EEG can help to identify so-called ""neuromarkers""
of social function (Tognoli, et al., 2007) and aid in disentangling the
dynamical architecture of social brains. We have studied neuromarkers and their
dynamics during synchronic interactions in which pairs of subjects coordinate
behavior spontaneously and intentionally (social coordination) and during
diachronic transactions that required subjects to perceive or behave in turn
(action observation and delayed imitation). We examined commonalities and
differences in the neuromarkers that are recruited for both kinds of tasks. We
found that the neuromarker landscape was task-specific: synchronic paradigms of
social coordination revealed medial mu, alpha and the phi complex as
contributing neuromarkers. Diachronic tasks recruited alpha as well, in
addition to lateral mu rhythms and the newly discovered nu and kappa rhythms
whose functional significance is still unclear. Social coordination,
observation, and delayed imitation share commonality of context: in our
experiments, subjects exchanged information through visual perception and moved
in similar ways. Nonetheless, there was little overlap between the neuromarkers
recruited for synchronic and diachronic tasks, a result that hints strongly of
task-specific neural mechanisms for social behaviors. The only neuromarker that
transcended both synchronic and diachronic social behaviors was the ubiquitous
alpha rhythm, which appears to be a key signature of visually-mediated social
behaviors. The present paper is both an entry point and a challenge...

well-known that at least one of the last two numbers is irrational. In this

computation is experimentally challenging. This thesis develops quantum logic
synthesis as a paradigm for reducing the resource overhead in fault-tolerant
quantum computing. The model for error correction considered here is the
surface code. After developing the theory behind general logic synthesis, the
resource costs of magic-state distillation for the $T = \exp(i \pi (I-Z)/8)$
gate are quantitatively analyzed. The resource costs for a relatively new
protocol distilling multi-qubit Fourier states are calculated for the first
time. Four different constructions of the fault-tolerant Toffoli gate,
including two which incorporate error detection, are analyzed and compared. The
techniques of logic synthesis reduce the cost of fault-tolerant quantum
computation by one to two orders of magnitude, depending on which benchmark is
used.
  Using resource analysis for $T$ gates and Toffoli gates, several proposals
for constructing arbitrary quantum gates are compared, including ""Clifford+$T$""
sequences, $V$-basis sequences, phase kickback, and programmable ancilla
rotations. The application of arbitrary gates to quantum algorithms for
simulating chemistry is discussed as well. Finally, the thesis examines the
techniques which lead to efficient constructions of quantum logic, and these
observations point to even broader applications of logic synthesis.

queries, such as ""What is the best position for a new billboard?"" and ""Which

require measuring and differentiating the visibility of an object (target) from
different viewpoints in a dataspace, e.g., a billboard may be seen from two
viewpoints but is readable only from the viewpoint closer to the target. In
this paper, we formulate the above problem of quantifying the visibility of
(from) a target object from (of) the surrounding area with a visibility color
map (VCM). A VCM is essentially defined as a surface color map of the space,
where each viewpoint of the space is assigned a color value that denotes the
visibility measure of the target from that viewpoint. Measuring the visibility
of a target even from a single viewpoint is an expensive operation, as we need
to consider factors such as distance, angle, and obstacles between the
viewpoint and the target. Hence, a straightforward approach to construct the
VCM that requires visibility computation for every viewpoint of the surrounding
space of the target, is prohibitively expensive in terms of both I/Os and
computation, especially for a real dataset comprising of thousands of
obstacles. We propose an efficient approach to compute the VCM based on a key
property of the human vision that eliminates the necessity of computing the
visibility for a large number of viewpoints of the space. To further reduce the
computational overhead, we propose two approximations; namely, minimum bounding
rectangle and tangential approaches with guaranteed error bounds. Our extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our solutions to
construct the VCM for real 2D and 3D datasets.

and the generated slow shocks are quite weak comparing with those in an
isotropic MHD. In spite of the weakness of the shocks, however, the resultant
reconnection rate is 10-30% higher than that in an isotropic case. This result

State-based models are common in stochastic control settings, but commonly used
frameworks such as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) assume a known stationary
environment. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in combining
the above two frameworks and considering an MDP setting in which the cost
function is allowed to change arbitrarily after each time step. However, most
of the work in this area has been algorithmic: given a problem, one would
develop an algorithm almost from scratch. Moreover, the presence of the state
and the assumption of an arbitrarily varying environment complicate both the
theoretical analysis and the development of computationally efficient methods.
This paper describes a broad extension of the ideas proposed by Rakhlin et al.
to give a general framework for deriving algorithms in an MDP setting with
arbitrarily changing costs. This framework leads to a unifying view of existing
methods and provides a general procedure for constructing new ones. Several new
methods are presented, and one of them is shown to have important advantages

technique for solving the integer least-squares (ILS) problems, which include
Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO)
systems. Two factors contribute to the speed of finding the optimal solution by
the MCMC detector: the probability of the optimal solution in the stationary
distribution, and the mixing time of the MCMC detector. Firstly, we compute the
optimal value of the ""temperature"" parameter, in the sense that the temperature
has the desirable property that once the Markov chain has mixed to its
stationary distribution, there is polynomially small probability
($1/\mbox{poly}(N)$, instead of exponentially small) of encountering the
optimal solution. This temperature is shown to be at most
$O(\sqrt{SNR}/\ln(N))$, where $SNR$ is the signal-to-noise ratio, and $N$ is
the problem dimension. Secondly, we study the mixing time of the underlying
Markov chain of the proposed MCMC detector. We find that, the mixing time of
MCMC is closely related to whether there is a local minimum in the lattice
structures of ILS problems. For some lattices without local minima, the mixing
time of the Markov chain is independent of $SNR$, and grows polynomially in the
problem dimension; for lattices with local minima, the mixing time grows
unboundedly as $SNR$ grows, when the temperature is set, as in conventional
wisdom, to be the standard deviation of noises. Our results suggest that, to
ensure fast mixing for a fixed dimension $N$, the temperature for MCMC should
instead be set as $\Omega(\sqrt{SNR})$ in general. Simulation results show that
the optimized MCMC detector efficiently achieves approximately ML detection in
MIMO systems having a huge number of transmit and receive dimensions.

necessary for both linear interference alignment (IA) and asymptotic IA
feasibility in MIMO-IBC with arbitrary configurations. In a special class of
asymmetric two-cell MIMOIBC, the irreducible condition is proved to be the
sufficient and necessary condition for asymptotic IA feasibility, while the
combination of proper condition and irreducible condition is proved to the
sufficient and necessary condition for linear IA feasibility. From these
conditions, we derive the information theoretic maximal DoF per user and the
maximal DoF per user achieved by linear IA, and these DoFs are also the DoF per

various functionalities inexpensively is always desirable. Polysilicon
(poly-Si) is an ideal platform because it is dopable and semi-conducting and
can be deposited and patterned easily on a wide range of low cost substrates.
However, the lack of crystalline coherency in poly-Si poses an immense
challenge for high-quality epitaxial growth. In this work, we demonstrate, for
the first time, direct growth of micron-sized InGaAs/GaAs nanopillars on
polysilicon. Transmission electron microscopy shows that the micron-sized
pillars are single-crystalline and single Wurzite-phase, far exceeding the
substrate crystal grain size ~100nm. The high quality growth is enabled by the
unique tapering geometry at the base of the nanostructure, which reduces the
effective InGaAs/Si contact area to < 40 nm in diameter. The small footprint
not only reduces stress due to lattice mismatch but also prevents the
nanopillar from nucleating on multiple Si crystal grains. This relaxes the
grain size requirement for poly-Si, potentially reducing the cost for poly-Si
deposition. Lasing is achieved in the as-grown pillars under optical pumping,
attesting their excellent crystalline and optical quality. These promising
results open up a pathway for low-cost synergy of optoelectronics with other
technologies such as CMOS integrated circuits, sensing, nanofluidics, thin film
transistor display, photovoltaics, etc.

physical field sensed by a homogeneous sensor network and develops a new
transformed expression for the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) on the variance of
distributed estimates. The proposed transformation reduces a multidimensional
integral representation of the CRLB to an expression involving an infinite sum.
Stochastic models used in this paper assume additive noise in both the
observation and transmission channels. Two cases of data transmission are
considered. The first case assumes a linear analog modulation of raw
observations prior to their transmission to a fusion center. In the second
case, each sensor quantizes its observation to $M$ levels, and the quantized
data are communicated to a fusion center. In both cases, parallel additive
white Gaussian channels are assumed. The paper develops an iterative
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate unknown parameters of a
parametric field, and its linearized version is adopted for numerical analysis.
The performance of the developed numerical solution is compared to the
performance of a simple iterative approach based on Newton's approximation.
While the developed solution has a higher complexity than Newton's solution, it
is more robust with respect to the choice of initial parameters and has a
better estimation accuracy. Numerical examples are provided for the case of a
field modeled as a Gaussian bell, and illustrate the advantages of using the
transformed expression for the CRLB. However, the distributed estimator and the
derived CRLB are general and can be applied to any parametric field. The
dependence of the mean-square error (MSE) on the number of quantization levels,
the number of sensors in the network and the SNR of the observation and
transmission channels are analyzed. The variance of the estimates is compared
to the derived CRLB.

distinct two regimes: for $J \stackrel{>}{_\sim} 2g^2/\omega_0$ with the phonon
frequency $\omega_0$, $\chi_{s}$ is enhanced relative to $\chi_{o}$ and shows a
divergence at $J=J_c$ above which the system becomes Mott insulator, while for

HD 285507b orbits a V=10.47 K4.5V dwarf ($M_* = 0.734 M_\odot$; $R_* = 0.656
R_\odot$) in a slightly eccentric ($e = 0.086^{+0.018}_{-0.019}$) orbit with a
period of $6.0881^{+0.0019}_{-0.0018}$ days. The induced stellar radial
velocity corresponds to a minimum companion mass of $M_{\rm p} \sin{i} = 0.917
\pm 0.033 M_{\rm Jup}$. Line bisector spans and stellar activity measures show
no correlation with orbital phase, and the radial velocity amplitude is
independent of wavelength, supporting the conclusion that the variations are
caused by a planetary companion. Follow-up photometry indicates with high
confidence that the planet does not transit. HD 285507b joins a small but
growing list of planets in open clusters, and its existence lends support to a
planet formation scenario in which a high stellar space density does not
inhibit giant planet formation and migration. We calculate the circularization
timescale for HD 285507b to be larger than the age of the Hyades, which may
indicate that this planet's non-zero eccentricity is the result of migration
via interactions with a third body. We also demonstrate a significant
difference between the eccentricity distributions of hot Jupiters that have had
time to tidally circularize and those that have not, which we interpret as
evidence against Type II migration in the final stages of hot Jupiter
formation. Finally, the dependence of the circularization timescale on the
planetary tidal quality factor, $Q_{\rm p}$, allows us to constrain the average
value for hot Jupiters to be $\log{Q_{\rm p}} = 6.14^{+0.41}_{-0.25}$.

an energy gap is not observed at the Fermi surface in the antiferromagnetic

perspective. A symmetric form of the two-layer kinetic equation for Rossby
waves is derived using canonical variables, allowing the turbulent cascade of
energy between the barotropic and baroclinic modes to be studied. It turns out
that energy is transferred via local triad interactions from the large-scale
baroclinic modes to the baroclinic and barotropic modes at the Rossby
deformation scale. From there it is then transferred to the large-scale
barotropic modes via a nonlocal inverse transfer. Using scale separation a sys-
tem of coupled equations were obtained for the small-scale baroclinic component
and the large-scale barotropic component. Since the total energy of the
small-scale component is not conserved, but the total barotropic plus
baroclinic energy is conserved, the baroclinic energy loss at small scales will
be compensated by the growth of the barotropic energy at large scales. It is
found that this transfer is mostly anisotropic and mostly to the zonal
component.

that electrically driven spin resonance can be induced in this system by
subharmonic driving, i.e., if the excitation frequency is an integer fraction

Rabi frequencies at the subharmonic resonances are comparable to the Rabi

the concept of this paper has provided comprehensive frameworks for a
successful migration to cloud computing (SMCC) in telecommunication industry in
Iran. Using an academic orientation, the conceptual research is focusing on the
determinants of a successful migration from legacy to cloud computing. The
study attempts to reveal the constructive effects and deconstructive defects of
migration to cloud computing with a close regard into prior literature and
practical practices all around the world. Conceptual frameworks are deducted
from the literature and Telco's revolutionary movements toward cloud computing.
The confirmatory quantitative approach tries to verify or reject the validity
of determinants of successful migration. The study reports that there are some
success and failure factors which are influencing a successful migration of
data centres and servers of Iranian Telecommunication to the cloud. Considering
these approved factors before any migration decision would be valuable for
engaged project members and finally for Telecommunication organization. This
paper can be used as reliable model for any migration beforehand taking any
action. Enforcing proper determinants in accordance with the prior success
stories and academia viewpoints in Telecommunication industry in Iran as a
first mover research in this field provides a precious insight for policy and
decision makers to change their mindset and grant a proper space for cloud
computing to grow in this industry due to its advantages. Obviously, like any
other big Telco in the world, Iranian Telco might start cloud projects to
sustain its presence in the global market.

dozen years. The most natural approach, namely to compute an amoeba via its

the contour, is understood in theory and computable in practice.
  We define and characterize the extended boundary of an amoeba, which is
sensitive to some degenerations that the topological boundary does not detect.
Our description of the extended boundary also allows us to distinguish between
the contour and the boundary. This gives rise not only to new structural
results in amoeba theory, but in particular allows us to compute hypersurface
amoebas via their boundary in any dimension. In dimension two this can be done
using Gr\""obner bases alone.
  We introduce the concept of amoeba bases, which are sufficient for

protostars NGC1333 IRAS4A and IRAS4B, to compare their HDO abundance
distribution with other star-forming regions, and to constrain their HDO/H2O
ratios. Methods. Using the Herschel/HIFI instrument as well as ground-based
telescopes, we observed several HDO lines covering a large excitation range
(Eup/k=22-168 K) towards these protostars and an outflow position. Non-LTE
radiative transfer codes were then used to determine the HDO abundance profiles
in these sources. Results. The HDO fundamental line profiles show a very broad
component, tracing the molecular outflows, in addition to a narrower emission
component and a narrow absorbing component. In the protostellar envelope of
NGC1333 IRAS4A, the HDO inner (T>100 K) and outer (T<100 K) abundances with
respect to H2 are estimated at 7.5x10^{-9} and 1.2x10^{-11}, respectively,
whereas, in NGC1333 IRAS4B, they are 1.0x10^{-8} and 1.2x10^{-10},
respectively. Similarly to the low-mass protostar IRAS16293-2422, an absorbing
outer layer with an enhanced abundance of deuterated water is required to
reproduce the absorbing components seen in the fundamental lines at 465 and 894
GHz in both sources. This water-rich layer is probably extended enough to
encompass the two sources as well as parts of the outflows. In the outflows
emanating from NGC1333 IRAS4A, the HDO column density is estimated at about
(2-4)x10^{13} cm^{-2}, leading to an abundance of about (0.7-1.9)x10^{-9}. An
HDO/H2O ratio between 7x10^{-4} and 9x10^{-2} is derived in the outflows. In
the warm inner regions of these two sources, we estimate the HDO/H2O ratios at
about 1x10^{-4}-4x10^{-3}. This ratio seems higher (a few %) in the cold
envelope of IRAS4A, whose possible origin is discussed in relation to formation
processes of HDO and H2O.

probes of the properties of the hot and dense QCD medium produced in heavy-ion
collisions. Due to their large masses, heavy quarks are produced at the initial
stage of the collision, almost exclusively via hard partonic scattering
processes. Therefore, they are expected to experience the full collision
history propagating through and interacting with the QCD medium. The parton
energy loss, which is sensitive to the transport coefficients of the produced
medium, can be studied experimentally by measuring the nuclear modication
factor ($R_{\rm AA}$) which accounts for the modication of the heavy-flavoured
hadron yield in Pb-Pb collisions with respect to pp collisions. In semi-central
Pb-Pb collisions, the degree of thermalization of charm quarks in the QCD
medium can be accessed via the measurement of the heavy flavour elliptic flow
$v_2$ at low $p_{\rm T}$ . At high $p_{\rm T}$, $v_2$ is sensitive to the
path-length dependence of heavy quark in-medium energy loss. The ALICE
collaboration has measured the production of open heavy flavour hadrons via
their hadronic and semi-leptonic decays at mid-rapidity and in the semi-muonic
decay channel at forward rapidity in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at 7, 5.02

distributed estimation algorithms based on the diffusion cooperation scheme in
the presence of errors due to the unreliable data transfer among nodes. In
particular, we highlight the impact of transmission errors on the least-mean
squares (LMS) adaptive networks. We develop the closed-form expressions of the
steady-state mean-square deviation (MSD) which is helpful to assess the effects
of the imperfect information flow on on the behavior of the diffusion LMS
algorithm in terms of the steady-state error. The model is then validated by
performing Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown that local and global MSD
curves are not necessarily monotonic increasing functions of the error
probability. We also assess sufficient conditions that ensure mean and
mean-square stability of diffusion LMS strategies in the presence of
transmission errors. Moreover, issues such as scalability in the sense of
network size and regressor size, spatially correlated observations, as well as
the effect of the distribution of the noise variance are studied.
  While the proposed theoretical framework is general in the sense that it is
not confined to a particular source of error during information diffusion, for
practical reasons we additionally study a specific scenario where errors occur
at the medium access control (MAC) level. We develop a model to quantify the
MAC-level transmission errors according to the network topology and system
parameters for a set of nodes employing a backoff procedure to access the
channel. To overcome the problem of unreliable data exchange, we propose an
enhanced combining rule that can be deployed in order to improve the
performance of diffusion estimation algorithms by using the knowledge of the
properties of the transmission errors.

first-order-type dynamic phase transition in current statistics and the
associated coexistence of different transport channels (or nonequilibrium
steady states) classified by symmetry. Microreversibility then ensues, via the
Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation theorem, a twin dynamic phase transition for rare
current fluctuations. Interestingly, the symmetry present in the initial state
is spontaneously broken at the fluctuating level, where the quantum system
selects the symmetry sector that maximally facilitates a given fluctuation. We
illustrate these results in a qubit network model motivated by the problem of
coherent energy harvesting in photosynthetic complexes, and introduce the
concept of a symmetry-controlled quantum thermal switch, suggesting
symmetry-based design strategies for quantum devices with controllable

accretion disk. Induction equation of the mean poloidal field is solved under
the standard viscous disk model. Magnetic flux evolution is controlled by the
two timescales: One is the timescale of the inward advection of the magnetic
flux, tau_{adv}. This is induced by the dragging of the flux by the accreting
gas. The other is the outward diffusion timescale of the magnetic flux
tau_{dif}. We consider diffusion due to the Ohmic resistivity. These timescales
can be significantly different from the disk viscous timescale tau_{disk}. The
behaviors of the magnetic flux evolution is quite different depending on the
magnitude relationship of the timescales tau_{adv}, \tau_{dif}, and tau_{disk}.
The most interesting phenomena occurs when tau_{adv} << tau_{dif}, tau_{disk}.
In such a case, the magnetic flux distribution approaches a quasi-steady
profile much faster than the viscous evolution of the gas disk, and also the
magnetic flux has been tightly bundled to the inner part of the disk. In the
inner part, although the poloidal magnetic field becomes much stronger than the
interstellar magnetic field, the field strength is limited to the maximum value
that is analytically given by our previous work (Okuzumi et al. 2014, ApJ, 785,
127). We also find a condition for that the initial large magnetic flux, which
is a fossil of the magnetic field dragging during the early phase of star
formation, survives for a duration in which significant gas disk evolution
proceeds.

interesting question is: when is a given connected normal digraph
distance-regular? Motivated by this question first we give some
characterizations of weakly distance-regular digraphs. Specially we show that
whether a given connected digraph to be weakly distance-regular only depends on
the equality for two invariants. Then we show that a connected normal digraph
$\G$ with $d+1$ distinct eigenvalues is distance-regular if and only if the
simple excess (the ratio of the square of mean of the numbers of shortest paths
between vertices at distance $d$ to the mean of the numbers of vertices at
distance $d$ from every vertex, which is zero if $d$ is greater than the
diameter) is equal to the spectral excess (a number which can be computed from
the spectrum of $\G$). In fact, this result is a new variation (a simple
variation) of the spectral excess theorem due to Fiol and Garigga for connected
normal digraphs. Using these results we derive another variation (a weighted
variation) of the spectral excess theorem for connected normal digraphs.
Distance regularity of a digraph (also a graph) is in general not determined by
its spectrum. For application of the simple variation we show that distance
regularity of a connected normal digraph $\G$ (with $d+1$ distinct eigenvalues)
is determined by its spectrum and the invariant $\delta_d$ (the mean of the
numbers of vertices at distance $d$ from every vertex). Finally as an
application of the weighted variation we show that every connected normal
digraph $\G$ with $d+1$ distinct eigenvalues and diameter $D$ is either a
bipartite digraph, or a generalized odd graph or it has odd-girth at most
$\min\{2d-1,2D+1\}$, generalizing a result of van Dam and Haemers and also a

interpreted through a 1D--spherical non--local radiative transfer model,
coupled to a chemical model that includes chemistry at thermochemical
equilibrium for the innermost regions and reaction kinetics for the external
envelope. Although unresolved by the present early ALMA data, the radius
inferred for the emitting region is $\sim$0.06'' (i.e., $\simeq$ 3 stellar
radii), similar to the size of the dusty clumps reported by IR studies of the
innermost region ($r <$ 0.3''). The derived abundance of HNC relative to H$_2$
is $10^{-8} <$ $\chi$(HNC) $< 10^{-6}$, and drops quickly where the gas density
decreases and the gas chemistry is dominated by reaction kinetics. Merging HNC
data with that of molecular species present throughout the inner envelope, such
as vibrationally excited HCN, SiS, CS, or SiO, should allow us to characterize
the physical and chemical conditions in the dust formation zone.

dimensional Minkowski space with finite energy tails which, if they reflect off
a uniformly accelerated mirror due to (say) Dirichlet boundary conditions on
it, develop an infinite stress-energy tensor on the mirror's Rindler horizon.
We also show that, in the presence of an image mirror in the opposite Rindler
wedge, suitable compactly supported arbitrarily small initial data on a
suitable initial surface will develop an arbitrarily large stress-energy scalar
near where the two horizons cross. Also, while there is a regular
Hartle-Hawking-Israel-like state for the quantum theory between these two
mirrors, there are coherent states built on it for which there are similar
singularities in the expectation value of the renormalized stress-energy
tensor. We conjecture that in other situations with analogous enclosed horizons
such as a (maximally extended) Schwarzschild black hole in equilibrium in a
(stationary spherical) box or the (maximally extended) Schwarzschild-AdS
spacetime, there will be similar stress-energy singularities and
almost-singularities -- leading to instability of the horizons when gravity is
switched on and matter and gravity perturbations are allowed for. All this
suggests it is incorrect to picture a black hole in equilibrium in a box or a
Schwarzschild-AdS black hole as extending beyond the past and future horizons
of a single Schwarzschild (/Schwarzschild-AdS) wedge. It would thus provide new
evidence for 't Hooft's brick wall model while seeming to invalidate the
picture in Maldacena's 'Eternal black holes in AdS'. It would thereby also
support the validity of the author's matter-gravity entanglement hypothesis and
of the paper 'Brick walls and AdS/CFT' by the author and Ort\'iz.

set of players is infinite or the domain from which the secret and/or the
shares are drawn is infinite or both, is similar to the case when switching to
abstract probability spaces from classical combinatorial probability. It might
shed new light on old problems, could connect seemingly unrelated problems, and
unify diverse phenomena.
  Definitions equivalent in the finitary case could be very much different when
switching to infinity, signifying their difference. The standard requirement
that qualified subsets should be able to determine the secret has different
interpretations in spite of the fact that, by assumption, all participants have
infinite computing power. The requirement that unqualified subsets should have
no, or limited information on the secret suggests that we also need some
probability distribution. In the infinite case events with zero probability are
not necessarily impossible, and we should decide whether bad events with zero
probability are allowed or not.
  In this paper, rather than giving precise definitions, we enlist an abundance
of hopefully interesting infinite secret sharing schemes. These schemes touch
quite diverse areas of mathematics such as projective geometry, stochastic
processes and Hilbert spaces. Nevertheless our main tools are from probability
theory. The examples discussed here serve as foundation and illustration to the
more theory oriented companion paper.

approximate equilibria in bimatrix games. We show that the deterministic query
complexity of finding an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium when $\epsilon <

combination with previous results \cite{FGGS13}, this provides a complete
characterization of the deterministic query complexity of approximate Nash

algorithm for finding a $(\frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} + \epsilon)$-Nash equilibrium
using $O(\frac{k \cdot \log k}{\epsilon^2})$ payoff queries, which shows that
the $\frac{1}{2}$ barrier for deterministic algorithms can be broken by
randomization. For well-supported Nash equilibria (WSNE), we first give a
randomized algorithm for finding an $\epsilon$-WSNE of a zero-sum bimatrix game
using $O(\frac{k \cdot \log k}{\epsilon^4})$ payoff queries, and we then use
this to obtain a randomized algorithm for finding a $(\frac{2}{3} +
\epsilon)$-WSNE in a general bimatrix game using $O(\frac{k \cdot \log

against randomized algorithms in the context of bimatrix games, by showing that
randomized algorithms require $\Omega(k^2)$ payoff queries in order to find a
$\frac{1}{6k}$-Nash equilibrium, even in zero-one constant-sum games. In
particular, this rules out query-efficient randomized algorithms for finding
exact Nash equilibria.

using star--companion astrometry, and several of these appear to have
eccentricities significantly greater than zero. We show that stellar motion
caused by an undetected inner body may result in the companion elements derived
in such a way being incorrect, which could lead to an overestimation of the
eccentricity. The magnitude of this effect is quantified in several regimes and
we derive the maximum eccentricity error a third body could introduce in a
general form, which may be easily applied to any imaged system. Criteria for
identifying systems potentially susceptible to this scenario are presented, and
we find that around half of the planets/companion brown dwarfs currently imaged
could be liable to these errors when their orbital elements are derived. In
particular, this effect could be relevant for systems within 100 pc with
companions at >50 AU, if they also harbour an unseen $\sim$ 10 Jupiter mass
object at $\sim$ 10 AU. We use the Fomalhaut system as an example and show that
a 10% error could be induced on the planet's eccentricity by an observationally
allowed inner mass, which is similar in size to the current error from
astrometry.

to models rotating up to the mass-shedding limit and show that the universality
of the relations is lost. With increasing rotation rate, the normalized I-Q
relation departs significantly from its slow-rotation limit deviating up to 40%
for neutron stars and up to 75% for strange stars. The deviation is also EOS
dependent and for a broad set of hadronic and strange matter EOS the spread due
to rotation is comparable to the spread due to the EOS, if one considers
sequences with fixed rotational frequency. Still, for a restricted sample of
modern realistic EOS one can parameterize the deviations from universality as a
function of rotation only. The previously proposed I-Love-Q relations should
thus be used with care, because they lose their universality in astrophysical

split supersymmetric scale of 10000 GeV the atmospheric mass leaves the allowed
experimental window, and that the solar mass leaves it even earlier, with a
split supersymmetric scale of 1000 GeV. This shows that the correct prediction
of neutrino observables in these models necessitates the inclusion of the
running of these couplings.

fundamental quantity for delay performance analysis in networks. However, the

poloidal field transport and focus on steady states where inward advection of a
field balances with outward diffusion due to effective resistivities. We
analytically derive the steady-state radial distribution of poloidal fields in
highly conducting accretion disks. The analytic solution reveals an upper limit
on the strength of large-scale vertical fields attainable in steady states. Any
excess poloidal field will be diffused away within a finite time, and we
demonstrate this with time-dependent numerical calculations of the mean-field
equations. We apply this upper limit to large-scale vertical fields threading
protoplanetary disks. We find that the maximum attainable strength is about 0.1
G at 1 AU, and about 1 mG at 10 AU from the central star. When combined with
recent magnetic accretion models, the maximum field strength translates into
the maximum steady-state accretion rate of $\sim 10^{-7} M_\odot {\rm
yr}^{-1}$, in agreement with observations. We also find that the maximum field
strength is ~ 1 kG at the surface of the central star provided that the disk
extends down to the stellar surface. This implies that any excess stellar
poloidal field of strength >~ kG can be transported to the surrounding disk.
This might in part resolve the magnetic flux problem in star formation.

promising source for gravitational-wave detector networks. The accuracy with
which the location of the source on the sky can be inferred from gravitational
wave data is a limiting factor for several potential scientific goals of
gravitational-wave astronomy, including multi-messenger observations. Various
methods have been used to estimate the ability of a proposed network to
localize sources. Here we compare two techniques for predicting the uncertainty
of sky localization -- timing triangulation and the Fisher information matrix
approximations -- with Bayesian inference on the full, coherent data set. We
find that timing triangulation alone tends to over-estimate the uncertainty in
sky localization by a median factor of $4$ for a set of signals from
non-spinning compact object binaries ranging up to a total mass of $20
M_\odot$, and the over-estimation increases with the mass of the system. We
find that average predictions can be brought to better agreement by the
inclusion of phase consistency information in timing-triangulation techniques.
However, even after corrections, these techniques can yield significantly
different results to the full analysis on specific mock signals. Thus, while
the approximate techniques may be useful in providing rapid, large scale
estimates of network localization capability, the fully coherent Bayesian
analysis gives more robust results for individual signals, particularly in the
presence of detector noise.

normal observations. In this paper, we study some asymptotic optimality
properties of certain multiple testing rules induced by a general class of
one-group shrinkage priors in a Bayesian decision theoretic framework, where
the overall loss is taken as the number of misclassified hypotheses. We assume
a two-groups normal mixture model for the data and consider the asymptotic
framework adopted in Bogdan et al. (2011) who introduced the notion of
asymptotic Bayes optimality under sparsity in the context of multiple testing.
The general class of one-group priors under study is rich enough to include,
among others, the families of three parameter beta, generalized double Pareto
priors, and in particular the horseshoe, the normal-exponential-gamma and the
Strawderman-Berger priors. We establish that within our chosen asymptotic
framework, the multiple testing rules under study asymptotically attain the
risk of the Bayes Oracle up to a multiplicative factor, with the constant in
the risk close to the constant in the Oracle risk. This is similar to a result
obtained in Datta and Ghosh (2013) for the multiple testing rule based on the
horseshoe estimator introduced in Carvalho et al. (2009, 2010). We further show
that under very mild assumption on the underlying sparsity parameter, the
induced decision rules based on an empirical Bayes estimate of the
corresponding global shrinkage parameter proposed by van der Pas et al. (2014),

transfer simulation of cosmic reionization to date. We show that there is
significant additional power in density fluctuations at very large scales. We
systematically investigate the effects this additional power has on the
progress, duration and features of reionization, as well as on selected
reionization observables. We find that comoving simulation volume of ~100 Mpc/h
per side is sufficient for deriving a convergent mean reionization history, but
that the reionization patchiness is significantly underestimated. We use
jackknife splitting to quantify the convergence of reionization properties with
simulation volume for both mean-density and variable-density sub-regions. We
find that sub-volumes of ~100 Mpc/h per side or larger yield convergent
reionization histories, except for the earliest times, but smaller volumes of
~50 Mpc/h or less are not well converged at any redshift. Reionization history
milestones show significant scatter between the sub-volumes, of Delta z=0.6-1
for ~50 Mpc/h volumes, decreasing to Delta z=0.3-0.5 for ~100 Mpc/h volumes,
and $\Delta z$~0.1 for ~200 Mpc/h volumes. If we only consider mean-density
sub-regions the scatter decreases, but remains at Delta z~0.1-0.2 for the
different size sub-volumes. Consequently, many potential reionization
observables like 21-cm rms, 21-cm PDF skewness and kurtosis all show good
convergence for volumes of ~200 Mpc/h, but retain considerable scatter for
smaller volumes. In contrast, the three-dimensional 21-cm power spectra at
large scales (k<0.25 h/Mpc) do not fully converge for any sub-volume size.
These additional large-scale fluctuations significantly enhance the 21-cm
fluctuations, which should improve the prospects of detection considerably,
given the lower foregrounds and greater interferometer sensitivity at higher
frequencies. (abridged)

Previous
work has developed some statistical estimators for characteristics of

inference for observations that are persistence diagrams are limited.
Specifically, there is a need for tests that can assess the strength of
evidence against a claim that two samples arise from the same population or
process. We propose the use of randomization-style null hypothesis significance
tests (NHST) for these situations. The test is based on a loss function that
comprises pairwise distances between the elements of each sample and all the
elements in the other sample. We use this method to analyze a range of
simulated and experimental data. Through these examples we experimentally
explore the power of the p-values. Our results show that the
randomization-style NHST based on pairwise distances can distinguish between
samples from different processes, which suggests that its use for hypothesis
tests upon persistence diagrams is reasonable. We demonstrate its application
on a real dataset of fMRI data of patients with ADHD.

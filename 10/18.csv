massive stars identified by the RMS survey to investigate the Galactic
distribution of recent massive star formation. We describe the various methods
used to assign distances extracted from the literature, and solve the distance
ambiguities towards ~200 sources located within the Solar circle using archival
HI data. These distances are used to calculate bolometric luminosities and
estimate the survey completeness (~2x10^4 lsun). In total, we calculate the
distance and luminosity of ~1650 sources, one third of which are above the
survey's completeness threshold. Examination of the sample's longitude,
latitude, radial velocities and mid-infrared images has identified ~120 small
groups of sources, many of which are associated with well known star formation
complexes, such as W43, W49 and W51.
  We compare the positional distribution of the sample with the expected
locations of the spiral arms, assuming a model of the Galaxy consisting of four
gaseous arms. The distribution of young massive stars in the Milky Way is
spatially correlated with the spiral arms, with strong peaks in the source
position and luminosity distributions at the arms' Galactocentric radii. The
overall source and luminosity surface densities are both well correlated with
the surface density of the molecular gas, which suggests that the massive star
formation rate per unit molecular mass is approximately constant across the
Galaxy.
  We estimate the total luminosity of the embedded massive star population to
be ~0.76x10^8 lsun, 30% of which is associated with the ten most active star
forming complexes. We measure the scale height as a function of Galactocentric
distance and find that it increases only modestly from ~20-30 pc between 4 and
8 kpc, but much more rapidly at larger distances.

that there are two fundamental mechanisms in an EH WSN: i) the energy diversity

from sensor node to sensor node, and ii) the sensing diversity associated with
the DCS process that entails that the energy consumption can also vary across

H. By comparing the relative intensities of line and continuum emission it is
possible to determine the enrichment of the flare plasma relative to the
composition of the photosphere. This is the first ionization potential or FIP
bias ($f$). Since thermal bremsstrahlung at EUV wavelengths is relatively
insensitive to the electron temperature, it is important to account for the
distribution of electron temperatures in the emitting plasma. We accomplish
this by using the observed spectra to infer the differential emission measure
distribution and FIP bias simultaneously. In each of the 21 flares that we
analyze we find that the observed composition is close to photospheric. The
mean FIP bias in our sample is $f=1.27\pm0.23$. This analysis suggests that the
bulk of the plasma evaporated during a flare comes from deep in the
chromosphere, below the region where elemental fractionation occurs.

black hole situated in a realistic cosmological context is not total
evaporation of the black hole; rather there will always be a remnant mass. The
key point is that the locus of emission of Hawking radiation is not the
globally defined event horizon. Rather the emission domain lies just outside a
timelike Marginal Outer Trapped Surface that is locally defined. The emission
domain is mainly located inside the event horizon. A spacelike singularity
forms behind the event horizon, and most of the Hawking radiation ends up at
this singularity rather than at infinity. Whether any Hawking radiation reaches
infinity depends on the relation between the emission domain and the event
horizon. From the outside view, even if radiation is seen as always being
emitted, the black hole never evaporates away, rather its mass and entropy
asymptote to finite non-zero limits, and the event horizon always acts as a
sink for matter and information. From an inside view, the matter and
information disappear into the singularity, which is the boundary of spacetime.
The argument is based on the nature of the processes at work plus a careful
delineation of the relevant causal domains; in order to confirm this model and
determine details of the outcome, detailed calculations of the expectation
value of the stress-energy-momentum tensor are needed to determine back
reaction effects.

while the second comes from coupling to potential fluctuations on a resistive
gate. We show that several quantum phase transitions (QPT) occur in such a
model, transitions which emulate those found in interacting systems such as
Luttinger liquids or Kondo systems. We first use bosonization to map this
dissipative resonant level model to a resonant level in a Luttinger liquid, one
with, curiously, two interaction parameters. Drawing on methods for analyzing
Luttinger liquids at both weak and strong coupling, we obtain the phase
diagram. For strong dissipation, a Berezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless QPT separates
strong-coupling and weak-coupling (charge localized) phases. In the
source-drain symmetric case, all relevant backscattering processes disappear at
strong coupling, leading to perfect transmission at zero temperature. In fact,
a QPT occurs as a function of the coupling asymmetry or energy of the resonant
level: the two phases are (i) the system is cut into two disconnected pieces
(zero transmission), or (ii) the system is a single connected piece with
perfect transmission, except for a disconnected fractional degree of freedom.
The latter arises from the competition between the two fermionic leads (source
and drain), as in the two-channel Kondo effect.

(IQFT) with diagonal scattering. Our derivations are based on various recent
results of D. Bernard and B. Doyon. The steady states are built by connecting
homogeneously two infinite halves of the system thermalized at different
temperatures $T_l$, $T_r$, and waiting for a long time. We evaluate the current
$J(T_l,T_r)$ using the exact QFT density matrix describing these
non-equilibrium steady states and using Al.B. Zamolodchikov's method of the
thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA). The scaled cumulant generating function is
obtained from the extended fluctuation relations which hold in integrable
models. We verify our formula in particular by showing that the conformal field
theory (CFT) result is obtained in the high-temperature limit. We analyze
numerically our non-equilibrium steady-state TBA equations for three models:
the sinh-Gordon model, the roaming trajectories model, and the sine-Gordon
model at a particular reflectionless point. Based on the numerics, we
conjecture that an infinite family of non-equilibrium $c$-functions, associated
to the scaled cumulants, can be defined, which we interpret physically. We
study the full scaled distribution function and find that it can be described
by a set of independent Poisson processes. Finally, we show that the
""additivity"" property of the current, which is known to hold in CFT and was
proposed to hold more generally, does not hold in general IQFT, that is
$J(T_l,T_r)$ is not of the form $f(T_l)-f(T_r)$.

the concatenation of diagrams. The dilute Temperley-Lieb algebra \dtl n(\beta)
has a similar diagrammatic definition where, now, points on the sides may
remain free of strings. Like \tl n, the dilute \dtl n depends on a parameter
\beta\in\mathbb C, often given as \beta=q+q^{-1} for some q\in\mathbb C^\times.
In statistical physics, the algebra plays a central role in the study of dilute
loop models. The paper is devoted to the construction of its principal
indecomposable modules.
  Basic definitions and properties are first given: the dimension of \dtl n,
its break up into even and odd subalgebras and its filtration through n+1
ideals. The standard modules \U{n,k} are then introduced and their behaviour
under restriction and induction is described. A bilinear form, the Gram
product, is used to identify their (unique) maximal submodule \dr{n,k} which is
then shown to be irreducible or trivial. It is then noted that \dtl n is a
cellular algebra. This fact allows for the identification of complete sets of
non-isomorphic irreducible modules and projective indecomposable ones. The
structure of \dtl n as a left module over itself is then given for all values
of the parameter q, that is, for both q generic and a root of unity.

genes based on measurements of gene expression levels across samples, where the
quantification of expression levels includes substantial technical and
biological noise. To address this problem, we developed a Bayesian sparse
latent factor model that uses a three parameter beta prior to flexibly model
shrinkage in the loading matrix. By applying three layers of shrinkage to the
loading matrix (global, factor-specific, and element-wise), this model has
non-parametric properties in that it estimates the appropriate number of
factors from the data. We added a two-component mixture to model each factor
loading as being generated from either a sparse or a dense mixture component;
this allows dense factors that capture confounding noise, and sparse factors
that capture local gene interactions. We developed two statistics to quantify
the stability of the recovered matrices for both sparse and dense matrices. We
tested our model on simulated data and found that we successfully recovered the
true latent structure as compared to related models. We applied our model to a
large gene expression study and found that we recovered known covariates and
small groups of co-regulated genes. We validated these gene subsets by testing
for associations between genotype data and these latent factors, and we found a
substantial number of biologically important genetic regulators for the
recovered gene subsets.

for studying a wide array of physics effects, including modifications of parton
distribution functions in nuclei, gluon saturation, and color neutralization
and hadronization in a nuclear environment, among others. All of these effects
are expected to have a significant dependence on the size of the nuclear target
and the impact parameter of the collision, also known as the collision
centrality. In this article, we detail a method for determining centrality
classes in p(d)+A collisions via cuts on the multiplicity at backward rapidity
(i.e., the nucleus-going direction) and for determining systematic
uncertainties in this procedure. For d+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV we
find that the connection to geometry is confirmed by measuring the fraction of
events in which a neutron from the deuteron does not interact with the nucleus.
As an application, we consider the nuclear modification factors R_{p(d)+A}, for
which there is a potential bias in the measured centrality dependent yields due
to auto-correlations between the process of interest and the backward rapidity
multiplicity. We determine the bias correction factor within this framework.
This method is further tested using the HIJING Monte Carlo generator. We find
that for d+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN)=200 GeV, these bias corrections are
small and vary by less than 5% (10%) up to p_T = 10 (20) GeV. In contrast, for
p+Pb collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 5.02 TeV we find these bias factors are an
order of magnitude larger and strongly p_T dependent, likely due to the larger
effect of multi-parton interactions.

loop quantum cosmology (LQC), which has been demonstrated to arise in all the
models studied so far. In most of the models, the bounce has been studied using
numerical simulations involving states which are sharply peaked and which
bounce at volumes much larger than the Planck volume. An important issue is to
confirm the existence of the bounce for states which have a wide spread, or
which bounce closer to the Planck volume. Numerical simulations with such
states demand large computational domains, making them very expensive and
practically infeasible with the techniques which have been implemented so far.
To overcome these difficulties, we present an efficient hybrid numerical scheme
using the property that at the small spacetime curvature, the quantum
Hamiltonian constraint in LQC, which is a difference equation with uniform
discretization in volume, can be approximated by a Wheeler-DeWitt differential
equation. By carefully choosing a hybrid spatial grid allowing the use of
partial differential equations at large volumes, and with a simple change of
geometrical coordinate, we obtain a surprising reduction in the computational
cost. This scheme enables us to explore regimes which were so far unachievable
for the isotropic model in LQC. Our approach also promises to significantly
reduce the computational cost for numerical simulations in anisotropic LQC
using high performance computing.

absorption feature for a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere, and is instead
best-described by a model with high-altitude clouds. Using a frequentist
hypothesis testing procedure, we can rule out a hydrogen-dominated cloud free
atmosphere to 4.9$\sigma$. When combined with other recent WFC3 studies, our
observations suggest that clouds may be common in exo-planetary atmospheres.

Our main result is to identify the homotopy type of the group-like monoid of

result regarding $R$-line bundles previously proven by the authors. The main
application is the calculation of the homotopy type of $BGL_n(End ((L))$ where
$L \to X$ is any $R$-line bundle, and $End (L)$ is the ring spectrum of
endomorphisms. In the case when such a bundle is the fiberwise suspension
spectrum of a principal bundle over a manifold, $G \to P \to M$, this leads to
a description of the $K$-theory of the string topology spectrum in terms of the

observed RC magnitudes and construct the density function in distance for our
fields. Three of the eastern fields show a distance bimodality with one
component at the ""systemic"" ~67 kpc SMC distance and a second component at ~55
kpc. Our data are not reproduced well by the various extant Magellanic Cloud
and Stream simulations. However, the models predict that the known HI
Magellanic Bridge (stretching from the SMC eastward towards the LMC) has a
decreasing distance with angle from the SMC and should be seen in both the
gaseous and stellar components. From comparison with these models we conclude
that the most likely explanation for our newly identified ~55 kpc stellar
structure in the eastern SMC is a stellar counterpart of the HI Magellanic
Bridge that was tidally stripped from the SMC ~200 Myr ago during a close
encounter with the LMC. This discovery has important implications for
microlensing surveys of the SMC.

$M_{J}$, either below the deuterium burning limit and thus planet mass or
straddling the deuterium-burning limit nominally separating planet-mass

a shallow trend $r_h \propto R_{gc}^{0.14}$ out to $R_{gc} \sim 100$ kpc, in

reproduce this relationship we simulate GC populations with various

find a steeper trend of $r_h \propto R_{gc}^{0.4}$. Instead we suggest that (a)
if the cluster system has an orbital anisotropy profile, where orbits become
preferentially radial with increasing galactocentric distance, AND (b) if
clusters become more tidally under-filling with galactocentric distance, the
observed relationship can be recovered. We also apply this approach to the red

photometry. We investigate the possible biases in measuring the intrinsic
Ly{\alpha} EW distribution for a LAE sample at z $\sim$ 4.5 in the Extended
CDFS. Only weak Malmquist-type bias in both the intrinsic Ly{\alpha} luminosity
function and the Ly{\alpha} EW distribution were found. However, the observed
EW distribution is severely biased if one only considers LAEs with detections
in the continuum. Taking the broadband non-detections into account requires
fitting the distribution of the broadband-to-narrowband ratio, which then gives
a larger EW distribution scale length. Assuming an exponential form of the
intrinsic Ly{\alpha} EW distribution dN/dEW = N exp(-EW/W$_0$), we obtain W$_0$
= 167+/-44{\AA} (uncorrected for IGM absorption of Ly{\alpha}). We discuss the
likely range of IGM absorption effects in light of recent measurements of
Ly{\alpha} line profiles and velocity offsets. Our data are consistent with
Ly{\alpha} EW being independent of UV luminosity (i.e., we do not see evidence

should be 0.5-1 magnitude deeper than narrowband images for an effective and
reasonably complete LAE survey. Comparing with consistent measurements at other

stars at a rate of 30-100 Msun/yr, yielding a mass assembly time M^{star}/SFR
150x10^6 yr. Himiko is estimated to have a low fraction (2-3% of the Solar
value) of elements heavier than helium (metallicity), and although its gas mass
cannot be asserted at this time its dust-to-stellar mass ratio is constrained
to be <0.05%. The local galaxy I Zw 18, with a metallicity 4% solar and forming
stars less rapidly than Himiko but still vigorously for its mass (M^{star}/SFR
1.6x10^9 yr), is also very dust deficient and perhaps one of the best analogues
of primitive galaxies accessible to detailed study. Here we report observations
of dust emission from I Zw 18 from which we determine its dust mass to be
450-1800 Msun, yielding a dust-to-stellar mass ratio \approx 10^{-6}-10^{-5}
and a dust-to-gas mass ratio 3.2-13x10^{-6}. If I Zw 18 is a reasonable analog
of Himiko, then Himiko's dust mass is \approx 50,000 Msun, a factor of 100
below the current upper limit. These numbers are considerably uncertain, but if
most high-z galaxies are more like Himiko than like the quasar host SDSS
J114816.64+525150.3, then the prospects for detecting the gas and dust in them
are much poorer than hitherto anticipated.

tensor factorizations are becoming more and more important tools for data

into binary factors while simultaneously making sure that the reconstructed

factorizations, can provide improved interpretability and find Boolean

the algorithms for computing Boolean tensor factorizations do not usually scale

features like run-time type information and reflection. ROAn provides an

arbitrary data, an associated suite of algorithms focused on DePFET data
analysis, and a viewer program for displaying and processing online or offline
detector data streams. The analysis program encapsulates the applied algorithms
in objects called steps which produce analysis results. The dependency between
results and thus the order of calculation is resolved automatically by the
program. To optimize algorithms for studying detector effects, analysis
parameters are often changed. Such changes of input parameters are detected in
subsequent analysis runs and only the necessary recalculations are triggered.
This saves time and simultaneously keeps the results consistent. The viewer
program offers a configurable Graphical User Interface (GUI) and process chain,
which allows the user to adapt the program to different tasks such as offline
viewing of file data, online monitoring of running detector systems, or
performing online data analysis (histogramming, calibration, etc.). Because of
its modular design, ROAn can be extended easily, e.g. be adapted to new

Optimizing this measure is a statistically and computationally challenging
problem, since no closed-form solution exists. Adopting a decision-theoretic
perspective, this article provides a formal and experimental analysis of
different approaches for maximizing the F-measure. We start with a Bayes-risk
analysis of related loss functions, such as Hamming loss and subset zero-one
loss, showing that optimizing such losses as a surrogate of the F-measure leads
to a high worst-case regret. Subsequently, we perform a similar type of
analysis for F-measure maximizing algorithms, showing that such algorithms are
approximate, while relying on additional assumptions regarding the statistical
distribution of the binary response variables. Furthermore, we present a new
algorithm which is not only computationally efficient but also Bayes-optimal,
regardless of the underlying distribution. To this end, the algorithm requires
only a quadratic (with respect to the number of binary responses) number of
parameters of the joint distribution. We illustrate the practical performance
of all analyzed methods by means of experiments with multi-label classification
problems.

unique same-sign diboson (SSdB) signature accompanied by modest jet activity

states with (WZ\to 3\ell)+\eslt as well as 4\ell+\eslt which give confirmatory
signals up to m_{\tg} 1.4 TeV. Directly produced light higgsinos yield a clean,
soft trilepton signature (due to very low visible energy release) which can be
visible, but only for a not-too-small a \tz_2-\tz_1 mass gap. The clean SSdB
signal -- as well as the distinctive mass shape of the dilepton mass
distribution from \tz_{2,3}\to\tz_1\ell\ell decays if this is accessible --
will mark the presence of light higgsinos which are necessary for natural SUSY.

reveal the predicted light higgsinos, the RNS model with m_{1/2}> 1 TeV may
elude all LHC14 search strategies even while maintaining a high degree of

star in which an A-type dwarf star eclipses the remnant of a disrupted red
giant star (WASP0247-25B). The remnant is in a rarely-observed state evolving
to higher effective temperatures at nearly constant luminosity prior to
becoming a very low-mass white dwarf composed almost entirely of helium, i.e.,
it is a pre-He-WD. We have used the WASP photometric database to find 17
eclipsing binary stars with orbital periods P=0.7 to 2.2 days with similar
lightcurves to 1SWASP J024743.37-251549.2. The only star in this group
previously identified as a variable star is the brightest one, EL CVn, which we
adopt as the prototype for this class of eclipsing binary star. The
characteristic lightcurves of EL CVn-type stars show a total eclipse by an
A-type dwarf star of a smaller, hotter star and a secondary eclipse of
comparable depth to the primary eclipse. We have used new spectroscopic
observations for 6 of these systems to confirm that the companions to the
A-type stars in these binaries have very low masses (approximately 0.2 solar
masses). This includes the companion to EL CVn which was not previously known
to be a pre-He-WD. EL CVn-type binary star systems will enable us to study the
formation of very low-mass white dwarfs in great detail, particularly in those
cases where the pre-He-WD star shows non-radial pulsations similar to those
recently discovered in WASP0247-25B.

challenging in high-dimensional settings, where it is difficult to detect
subtle individual effects and interactions between predictors. Bayesian
Additive Regression Trees [BART, Ann. Appl. Stat. 4 (2010) 266-298] provides a
novel nonparametric alternative to parametric regression approaches, such as
the lasso or stepwise regression, especially when the number of relevant
predictors is sparse relative to the total number of available predictors and
the fundamental relationships are nonlinear. We develop a principled
permutation-based inferential approach for determining when the effect of a
selected predictor is likely to be real. Going further, we adapt the BART
procedure to incorporate informed prior information about variable importance.
We present simulations demonstrating that our method compares favorably to
existing parametric and nonparametric procedures in a variety of data settings.
To demonstrate the potential of our approach in a biological context, we apply
it to the task of inferring the gene regulatory network in yeast (Saccharomyces
cerevisiae). We find that our BART-based procedure is best able to recover the
subset of covariates with the largest signal compared to other variable
selection methods. The methods developed in this work are readily available in

films which results in appearance of Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) peaks in
UV-visible absorption spectra. Thin films of Cesium Halide grown by thermal
evaporation are polycrystalline in nature with large irregular tightly packed
grains with sharp grain boundaries. With time these grain boundaries recede to
become smaller and spherical in shape in order to minimize the free surface
energy of the system. The process is also assisted by the presence of point
defects/color centers in Cesium Halide films. These defects which appear due to
the absence of massive halide atoms from the lattice results in residual
tensile stress within the lattice which results in defect diffusion. The
defects migrate outwards towards the grain surface giving rise to Cesium metal
clusters. The lattice mismatch appearing between the lattices at the grain
boundary and the bulk giving rise to Core-shell structure further contributes
to grain division. Along with this volume diffusion, a surface diffusion of
Cesium takes place towards sites of faceted grain boundaries resulting in a
necking phenomenon, appearing like bridges between the daughter Cesium Halide
grains (grains appearing due to division of a single grain). Breaking away of
the daughter Cesium Halide grains results in nano-rods that contribute to the
SPR peak seen.

dynamic network model of Kuhn, Lynch, and Oshman (STOC 2010) in which the
network topology changes from round to round but the network stays connected.
This is a synchronous model in which network nodes are assumed to be fixed, the
communication links for each round are chosen by an adversary, and nodes do not
know who their neighbors are for the current round before they broadcast their
messages. Queue requests may arrive over rounds at arbitrary nodes and the goal
is to eventually enqueue them in a distributed queue. We present two algorithms
that give a total distributed ordering of queue requests in this model. We
measure the performance of our algorithms through round complexity, which is
the total number of rounds needed to solve the distributed queuing problem. We
show that in 1-interval connected graphs, where the communication links change
arbitrarily between every round, it is possible to solve the distributed
queueing problem in O(nk) rounds using O(log n) size messages, where n is the
number of nodes in the network and k <= n is the number of queue requests.
Further, we show that for more stable graphs, e.g. T-interval connected graphs
where the communication links change in every T rounds, the distributed queuing
problem can be solved in O(n+ (nk/min(alpha,T))) rounds using the same O(log n)
size messages, where alpha > 0 is the concurrency level parameter that captures
the minimum number of active queue requests in the system in any round. These
results hold in any arbitrary (sequential, one-shot concurrent, or dynamic)

correlation with [Na/Fe] among the CN-weak giants, but there is little evidence
for such among the CN-strong giants. Neither oxygen or sodium abundance define
a continuous relation with CN band strength. Instead, the CN-strong and CN-weak

many natural systems such as saturated soils, fault gouge, and landslides. The
grain motion and the fluid pressure influence each other: It is well
established that when the fluid pressure rises, the shear resistance of
fluid-filled granular systems decreases, and as a result catastrophic events
such as soil liquefaction, earthquakes, and accelerating landslides may be
triggered. Alternatively, when the pore pressure drops, the shear resistance of
these systems increases. Despite the great importance of the coupled mechanics
of grains-fluid systems, the basic physics that controls this coupling is far
from understood. We developed a new multi-scaled model based on the discrete
element method, coupled with a continuum model of fluid pressure, to explore
this dynamical system. The model was shown recently to capture essential
feedbacks between porosity changes arising from rearrangement of grains, and
local pressure variations due to changing pore configurations. We report here
new results from numerical experiments of a continuously shearing layer of
circular two-dimensional grains, trapped between two parallel rough boundaries.
The experiments use a fixed confining stress on the boundary walls, and a
constant velocity applied to one of the boundaries, as if this system was the
interior of a sliding geological fault filled with 'fault gouge'. In addition,
we control the layer permeability and the drainage boundary conditions. This
paper presents modeling results showing that the localization of shear (into a
narrow shear band within the shearing layer) is strongly affected by the
presence of fluids. While in dry granular layers there is no preferred position
for the onset of localization, drained systems tend to localize shear on their
boundary. We propose a scaling argument to describe the pressure deviations in
a shear band, and use that to predict the allowable positions of shear
localizations as a function of the fault and gouge properties.

strong variations on $H_\perp$ (from 40 kHz to 1 MHz), the frequency tunability
in current remains almost constant (~7 MHz/mA). We demonstrate that our
vortex-based oscillator is quasi-isochronous independently of $H_\perp$, so
that the severe nonlinear broadening usually observed in STNOs does not exist.
Interestingly, this does not imply a loss of frequency tunability, which is
here governed by the current induced Oersted field. Nevertheless this is not
sufficient to achieve the highest spectral purity in the full range of
$H_\perp$ either: we show that the observed linewidth broadenings are due to
the excited mode interacting with a lower energy overdamped mode, which occurs
at the successive crossings between harmonics of these two modes. These
findings open new possibilities for the design of STNOs and the optimization of
their performance.

the same space time and acquires a modification (coupling-like) of the form
{\gamma}^{{\alpha}}j((1-d)/d){\gamma}h_{{\alpha}}, with h_{{\alpha}} the

integrated Perturbation Theory (iPT). In addition to the gravity-induced
non-Gaussianity, we consider the non-Gaussianity of the primordial curvature
perturbations, and investigate in detail the effect of such primordial
non-Gaussianity on the large-scale halo/galaxy bispectrum. In iPT, the effects
of primordial non-Gaussianity are wholly encapsulated in the linear
(primordial) polyspectra, and we systematically calculate the contributions to
the large-scale behaviors arising from the three types of primordial bispectrum
(local-, equilateral-, and orthogonal-types), and primordial trispectrum of the
local-type non-Gaussianity. We find that the equilateral- and orthogonal-type
non-Gaussianities show distinct scale-dependent behaviors which can dominate
the gravity-induced non-Gaussianity at very large scales. For the local-type
non-Gaussianity, higher-order loop corrections are found to give a
significantly large contribution to the halo/galaxy bispectrum of the squeezed
shape, and eventually dominate over the other contributions on large scales. A
diagrammatic approach based on the iPT helps us to systematically investigate
an impact of such higher-order contributions to the large-scale halo/galaxy
bispectrum.

in reactive processes. The phase space of the variables (concentrations in
reactive systems) is partitioned into a finite number of segments, which
constitute the nodes of the abstract network. Transitions between the nodes are
dictated by the dynamics of the reactive process and provide the links between
the nodes. These are weighted networks, since each link weight reflects the
transition rate between the corresponding states-nodes. With this construction
the network properties mirror the dynamics of the underlying process and one
can investigate the system properties by studying the corresponding abstract
network. As a working example the Lattice Limit Cycle (LLC) model is used. Its
corresponding abstract network is constructed and the transition matrix
elements are computed via Kinetic (Dynamic) Monte Carlo simulations. For this
model it is shown that the degree distribution follows a power law with
exponent -1, while the average clustering coefficient $c(N)$ scales with the
network size (number of nodes) $N$ as $c(N)\sim N^{-\nu}, \nu \simeq 1.46$. The
computed exponents classify the LLC abstract reactive network into the
scale-free networks. This conclusion corroborates earlier investigations
demonstrating the formation of fractal spatial patterns in LLC reactive
dynamics due to stochasticity and to the clustering of homologous species. The
present construction of abstract networks (based on the partition of the phase
space) is generic and can be implemented with appropriate adjustments in many
dynamical systems and in time series analysis.

V617 Sagittarii (V617 Sgr). We analyzed the orbital period change of V617 Sgr,
by employing three new CCD eclipse timings since 2010 along with all the
available data from the literature. It was found that the orbital period of
V617 Sgr undergoes an obvious long-term increase, which confirms the result
revealed by Steiner et al. (2006). The rate of orbital period increase was
calculated to be ${\dot{P}}$ = +2.14(0.05) $\times$ 10$^{-7}$ day/year. This
suggests the lifetime of the secondary star will attain to the end in a
timescale of 0.97 $\times$ 10$^6$ years faster than that predicted previously.
In particular, a cyclic variation with a period of 4.5 year and an amplitude of
2.3 minutes may present in the O-C diagram. Dominated by the wind-accretion
mechanism, high mass transfer from the low mass secondary to the white dwarf is
expected to sustain in the V Sge-type star V617 Sgr during its long-term
evolution. The mass transfer rate $|\dot{M}_{tr}|$ was estimated to be in the
range of about 2.2 $\times$ 10$^{-7}$ to 5.2 $\times$ 10$^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$
yr$^{-1}$. Accordingly, the already massive ($\geq$ 1.2 M$_{\odot}$) white
dwarf primary will process stable nuclear burning, accrete a fraction of mass
from its companion to reach the standard Chandrasekhar mass limit ($\simeq$
1.38 M$_{\odot}$), and ultimately produce a type Ia supernova (SN Ia) within
about 4 $\sim$ 8 $\times$ 10$^{5}$ years or earlier.

requirement that the electric current contained in the current layer consists
of the local electric charge moving outward at close to the speed of light,
yields a new standard solution for the pulsar magnetosphere everywhere ideal
force-free except in the current layer. The main elements of the new solution
are a) the pulsar spindown rate of the aligned rotator is 23% times larger than
that of the orthogonal vacuum rotator, b) only 60% of the magnetic flux that
crosses the light cylinder opens up to infinity, c) the electric current closes
along the other 40% which gradually converges to the equator, d) this transfers
40% of the total pulsar spindown energy flux in the equatorial current sheet
which is then dissipated in the acceleration of particles and in high-energy
electromagnetic radiation, e) there is no separatrix current layer. Our
solution is a minimum free-parameter solution in that the equatorial current
layer is electrostatically supported against collapse and thus does not require
a thermal particle population. In that respect, it is one more step toward the
development of a new standard solution. We discuss the implications for
intermittent pulsars and long duration gamma-ray bursts. We conclude that the
physical conditions in the equatorial current layer determine the global

promising technique to achieve significant sidelobe suppression of baseband
OFDM signals. However, the high complexity limits its application. Based on
conventional NC-OFDM, in this paper, a new technique, called time-domain
N-continuous OFDM (TD-NC-OFDM), is proposed to transfer the original
frequency-domain processing to the time domain, by the linear combination of a
novel basis set to smooth the consecutive OFDM symbols and their high-order
derivatives. We prove that TD-NC-OFDM is an equivalent to conventional one
while consuming much lower complexity. Furthermore, via the time-domain
structure, a closed-form spectral expression of NC-OFDM signals is derived and
a compact upper bound of sidelobe decaying is derived. This paper also
investigates the impact of the TD-NC-OFDM technique on received
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and provides a closed-form
analytical expression. Theoretical analyses and simulation results show that
TD-NC-OFDM can prohibitively suppress the sidelobe with much lower complexity.

rather the tail of the distribution of the standard long GRB duration. In this
Letter, using the long GRB sample detected by {\em Swift}, we investigate on
the statistical properties of ultra-long GRBs and compare them with the overall

from the standard long GRBs with typical burst duration less than 100-500

interpret this result as an indication that an alternative scenario has to be
found in order to explain the ultra-long GRB extreme energetics, as well as the
mass reservoir and its size that can feed the central engine for such a long

patients suffering of various neurological disorders. In order to prevent falls
while walking, one should rely on relevant early indicators of impaired dynamic
balance. The local dynamic stability (LDS) represents the sensitivity of gait
to small perturbations: divergence exponents (maximal Lyapunov exponents)
assess how fast a dynamical system diverges from neighbor points. Although
numerous findings attest the validity of LDS as a fall risk index, reliability
results are still sparse. The present study explores the intrasession and
intersession repeatability of gait LDS using intraclass correlation
coefficients (ICC) and standard error of measurement (SEM). Ninety-five healthy
individuals performed 5min. treadmill walking in two sessions separated by 9
days. Trunk acceleration was measured with a 3D accelerometer. Three time
scales were used to estimate LDS: over 4 to 10 strides ({\lambda}4-10), over
one stride ({\lambda}1) and over one step ({\lambda}0.5). The intrasession
repeatability was assessed from three repetitions of either 35 strides or 70
strides taken within the 5min tests. The intersession repeatability compared
the two sessions, which totalized 210 strides. The intrasession ICCs
(70-strides estimates/35-strides estimates) were 0.52/0.18 for {\lambda}4-10
and 0.84/0.77 for {\lambda}1 and {\lambda}0.5. The intersession ICCs were
around 0.60. The SEM results revealed that {\lambda}0.5 measured in
medio-lateral direction exhibited the best reliability, sufficient to detect
moderate changes at individual level (20%). However, due to the low
intersession repeatability, one should average several measurements taken on
different days in order to better approximate the true LDS.

mass-metallicity relation at $z\sim1.6$ is steeper than the relation observed
in the local Universe. The steeper MZ relation at $z\sim1.6$ is mainly due to
evolution in the stellar mass where the MZ relation begins to turnover and
flatten. This turnover mass is 1.2 dex larger at $z\sim1.6$. The most massive
galaxies at $z\sim1.6$ ($\sim 10^{11}M_\odot$) are enriched to the level
observed in massive galaxies in the local Universe. The mass-metallicity
relation we measure at $z\sim1.6$ supports the suggestion of an empirical upper
metallicity limit that does not significantly evolve with redshift. We find an
anti-correlation between metallicity and star formation rate for galaxies at a
fixed stellar mass at $z\sim1.6$ which is similar to trends observed in the
local Universe. We do not find a relation between stellar mass, metallicity and
star formation rate that is independent of redshift; our data suggest that
there is redshift evolution in this relation. We examine the relation between
stellar mass, metallicity and dust extinction. We find that at a fixed stellar
mass dustier galaxies tend to be more metal rich. From examination of the
stellar masses, metallicities, SFRs and dust extinctions we conclude that
stellar mass is most closely related to dust extinction.

a nearly flat radio spectrum that is typical for jets in active galactic
nuclei. Indeed, time-dependent magnetized models of radiatively inefficient
accretion flows (RIAFs), which are commonly used to explain the millimeter,
near-infrared, and X-ray emission of Sgr A*, often also produce jet-like
outflows. However, the emission from these models has so far failed to
reproduce the flat radio spectrum. Aims: We investigate whether current
accretion simulations can produce the compact flat spectrum emission by simply
using a different prescription for the heating of the radiating particles in
the jet. Methods: We studied the radiative properties of accretion flows onto a
black hole produced in time-dependent general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic
(GRMHD) simulations. A crucial free parameter in these models has always been
the electron temperature, and here we allowed for variations in the
proton-to-electron temperature ratios in the jet and disk. Results: We found
that the flat spectrum is readily reproduced by a standard GRMHD model if one
has an almost isothermal jet coupled to a two-temperature accretion flow. The
low-frequency radio mission comes from the outflowing sheath of matter
surrounding the strongly magnetized nearly empty jet. The model is consistent
with the radio sizes and spectrum of Sgr A*. Conclusions: Hence, GRMHD models
of accreting black holes can in principle naturally reproduce jets that match
observed characteristics. For Sgr A* the model fit to the spectrum predicts
higher mass-accretion rates when a jet is included than without a jet. Hence,
the impact of the recently discovered G2 cloud that is expected to be accreted
onto Sgr A* might be less severe than currently thought.

publish more semi-structured datasets following the RDF model, based on atomic
triple units of subject, predicate, and object. Although it is a simple model,
compression methods become necessary because datasets are increasingly larger
and various scalability issues arise around their organization and storage.
This requirement is more restrictive in RDF stores because efficient SPARQL
resolution on the compressed RDF datasets is also required.
  This article introduces a novel RDF indexing technique (called k2-triples)
supporting efficient SPARQL resolution in compressed space. k2-triples, uses
the predicate to vertically partition the dataset into disjoint subsets of
pairs (subject, object), one per predicate. These subsets are represented as
binary matrices in which 1-bits mean that the corresponding triple exists in
the dataset. This model results in very sparse matrices, which are efficiently
compressed using k2-trees. We enhance this model with two compact indexes
listing the predicates related to each different subject and object, in order
to address the specific weaknesses of vertically partitioned representations.
The resulting technique not only achieves by far the most compressed
representations, but also the best overall performance for RDF retrieval in our
experiments. Our approach uses up to 10 times less space than a state of the
art baseline, and outperforms its performance by several order of magnitude on
the most basic query patterns. In addition, we optimize traditional join
algorithms on k2-triples and define a novel one leveraging its specific
features. Our experimental results show that our technique overcomes
traditional vertical partitioning for join resolution, reporting the best
numbers for joins in which the non-joined nodes are provided, and being
competitive in the majority of the cases.

excitations of quarks are suppressed by the Polyakov loop. As temperature
increases, kaons and pions melt into the continuum of quark and anti-quark

pressure coming from the effective potential for the Polyakov loop. Since we

that reflects startup costs of generators. Dynamic pricing, which is a method
to control demand by pricing electricity at hourly (or more often) intervals,
has been studied by many researchers. They assume that the cost functions of
suppliers are convex, although they may be nonconvex because of the startup
costs of generators in practice. We provide a dynamic pricing model that takes
into account such cost functions within the settings of unit commitment
problems (UCPs). Our model gives convex hull price (CHP), which has not been
used in the context of dynamic pricing, though it is known that the CHP
minimizes the uplift payment which is disadvantageous to suppliers for a given
demand. In addition, we apply an iterative algorithm based on the subgradient
method to solve our model. Numerical experiments show the efficiency of our
model on reducing uplift payments. The prices determined by our algorithm give
sufficiently small uplift payments in a realistic computational time.

Resonance (NMR). The local moments carried by Mn impurities doped into
Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2(Co-122) and BaFe(As1-xPx)2(P-122) at optimal doping induce a
spin polarization in the vicinity of the impurity. The amplitude, shape and
extension of this polarisation is given by the real part of the susceptibility
chi'(r) of FeAs layers, and is consequently related to the nature and strength
of the electronic correlations present in the system. We study this
polarisation using 75As NMR in Co-122 and both 75As and 31P NMR in P-122. The
NMR spectra of Mn-doped materials is made of two essential features. First is a
satellite line associated with nuclei located as nearest neighbor of Mn
impurities. The analysis of the temperature dependence of the shift of this
satellite line shows that Mn local moments behave as isolated Curie moments.
The second feature is a temperature dependent broadening of the central line.
We show that the broadening of the central line follows the susceptibility of
Mn local moments, as expected from typical RKKY-like interactions. This
demonstrates that the susceptibility chi'(r) of FeAs layers does not make
significant contribution to the temperature dependent broadening of the central
line. chi'(r) is consequently only weakly temperature dependent in optimally
doped Co-122 and P-122. This behaviour is in contrast with that of strongly
correlated materials such as underdoped cuprate high-Tc superconductors where
the central line broadens faster than the impurity susceptibility grows,
because of the development of strong magnetic correlations when T is lowered.
Moreover, the FeAs layer susceptibility is found quantitatively similar in both
heterovalent doped and isolvalent doped BaFe2As2.

retrieved from observations of Venus in transit by matching it to the
convolution of a model of the venusian disc and solar background with a guess
PSF. Observations recorded near in time to the transit of Venus were corrected
for instrumental scattered light by the deconvolution with the PSF. Granulation
contrast in restored HMI data is greatly enhanced relative to the original data
and exhibit reasonable agreement with numerical simulations. Image restoration
enhanced the apparent intensity and pixel averaged magnetic field strength of
photospheric magnetic features significantly. For small-scale magnetic
features, restoration enhanced intensity contrast in the continuum and core of
the Fe I 617.3 nm line by a factor of 1.3, and the magnetogram signal by a
factor of 1.7. For sunspots and pores, the enhancement varied strongly within
and between features, being more acute for smaller features. Magnetic features
are also rendered smaller, as signal smeared onto the surrounding quiet Sun is
recovered. Image restoration increased the apparent amount of magnetic flux
above the noise floor by a factor of about 1.2, most of the gain coming from
the quiet Sun. Line-of-sight velocity due to granulation and supergranulation
is enhanced by a factor of 1.4 to 2.1, depending on position on the solar disc.
There are indications that the PSF varies across the FOV, with time and between
the two CCDs. However, all these variations were found to be relatively small,
such that the derived PSF can be applied to HMI data from both CCDs, over the
period examined without introducing significant error. Image restoration
affects the measured radiant, magnetic and dynamic properties of solar surface
phenomena sufficiently to significantly impact interpretation.

an important role in the process of language evolution. Nowadays, information
is spread through a variety of networks, including, among others, online and
offline social networks and the World Wide Web. The entire system, comprising
networks of different nature, can be represented as a multi-layer network. In
this context, lexical innovations diffusion occurs in a peculiar fashion. In
particular, a lexical innovation can undergo three different processes: its
original meaning is accepted; its meaning can be changed or misunderstood
(e.g., when not properly explained), hence more than one meaning can emerge in
the population; lastly, in the case of a loan word, it can be translated into
the population language (i.e., defining a new lexical innovation or using a
synonym) or into a dialect spoken by part of the population. Therefore, lexical
innovations cannot be considered simply as information. We develop a model for
analyzing this scenario using a multi-layer network comprising a social network
and a media network. The latter represents the set of all information systems
of a society, e.g., television, the World Wide Web and radio. Furthermore, we
identify temporal directed edges between the nodes of these two networks. In
particular, at each time step, nodes of the media network can be connected to
randomly chosen nodes of the social network and vice versa. In so doing,
information spreads through the whole system and people can share a lexical
innovation with their neighbors or, in the event they work as reporters, by
using media nodes. Lastly, we use the concept of ""linguistic sign"" to model
lexical innovations, showing its fundamental role in the study of these
dynamics. Many numerical simulations have been performed.

extended with new features the test suite also typically grows as new test
cases are added. To ensure software quality throughout this process the test
suite is continously executed, often on a daily basis. It seems likely that
newly added tests would be more likely to fail than older tests but this has
not been investigated in any detail on large-scale, industrial software
systems. Also it is not clear which methods should be used to conduct such an
analysis. This paper proposes three main concepts that can be used to
investigate aging effects in the use and failure behavior of system test cases:
test case activation curves, test case hazard curves, and test case half-life.
To evaluate these concepts and the type of analysis they enable we apply them
on an industrial software system containing more than one million lines of
code. The data sets comes from a total of 1,620 system test cases executed a
total of more than half a million times over a time period of two and a half
years. For the investigated system we find that system test cases stay active
as they age but really do grow old; they go through an infant mortality phase
with higher failure rates which then decline over time. The test case half-life
is between 5 to 12 months for the two studied data sets.

non-Hermitian tight-binding lattices with spatially-extended loss/gain regions
in presence of an advective term. Similarly to the instability properties of
hydrodynamic open flows, it is shown that $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking can
be either absolute or convective. In the former case, an initially-localized
wave packet shows a secular growth with time at any given spatial position,
whereas in the latter case the growth is observed in a reference frame moving
at some drift velocity while decay occurs at any fixed spatial position. In the
convective unstable regime, $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry is restored when the
spatial region of gain/loss in the lattice is limited (rather than extended).
We consider specifically a non-Hermitian extension of the Rice-Mele tight
binding lattice model, and show the existence of a transition from absolute to
convective symmetry breaking when the advective term is large enough. An
extension of the analysis to ac-dc-driven lattices is also presented, and an
optical implementation of the non-Hermitian Rice-Mele model is suggested, which
is based on light transport in an array of evanescently-coupled optical
waveguides with a periodically-bent axis and alternating regions of optical

not been fully understood yet. It is the aim of this work, to obtain more
insight into the Boundary Layer around the white dwarf in compact binary
systems. There are still many uncertainties concerning the extent and
temperature of the BL and the rotation rate of the white dwarf. We perform
numerical hydrodynamical simulations, where the problem is treated in a
one-dimensional, radial approximation (slim disk). The turbulence is described
by the alpha parameter viscosity. We include both cooling from the disk
surfaces and radial radiation transport. The radiation energy is treated in the
one-temperature approximation. For a given M_dot our results show a strong
dependence on the stellar mass and rotation rate. Both, the midplane and the
effective temperature rise considerably with increasing stellar mass or
decreasing stellar rotation rate. Our simulations further show, that the
radiation energy and pressure are indeed important in the BL. However, some
models show a low optical depth in the BL, making it necessary to find a better
representation for optically thin regions. The combination of a high mass and a
small radius, such as in white dwarfs, can lead to an enormous energy release
in the BL, provided the WD rotates slowly. Since the radial extent of BLs is
typically very small (about 0.02 to 0.05 R_star), this leads to surface
temperatures of a few hundred thousand Kelvin. All of our models showed
subsonic infall velocities with Mach numbers of < 0.4 at most.

possible explanation of the forces measured in asymmetric resonant microwave
cavities, and the variation of the amplitude of electromagnetic waves as they
propagate in static electric or magnetic fields. These rather unique effects
are excelent candidates for laboratory tests of this particular type of
scalar-tensor theory. In the present work we introduce an additional remarkable
effect of the theory: the generation of pulsed gravitational forces by
transient, quasi-stationary electromagnetic fields. In particular, we explore
the possible measurable effects of the simple experiment of turning on and off
the current in a coil. We show that with the proposed values of the constant in
the theory, this effect could resonantly excite a pendulum oscillation up to an
easily measurable magnitude.

  2013",,,,"cs.NA cs.LG math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many problems in machine learning and other fields can be (re)for-mulated as
linearly constrained separable convex programs. In most of the cases, there are
multiple blocks of variables. However, the traditional alternating direction
method (ADM) and its linearized version (LADM, obtained by linearizing the
quadratic penalty term) are for the two-block case and cannot be naively
generalized to solve the multi-block case. So there is great demand on
extending the ADM based methods for the multi-block case. In this paper, we
propose LADM with parallel splitting and adaptive penalty (LADMPSAP) to solve
multi-block separable convex programs efficiently. When all the component
objective functions have bounded subgradients, we obtain convergence results
that are stronger than those of ADM and LADM, e.g., allowing the penalty
parameter to be unbounded and proving the sufficient and necessary conditions}
for global convergence. We further propose a simple optimality measure and
reveal the convergence rate of LADMPSAP in an ergodic sense. For programs with
extra convex set constraints, with refined parameter estimation we devise a
practical version of LADMPSAP for faster convergence. Finally, we generalize
LADMPSAP to handle programs with more difficult objective functions by
linearizing part of the objective function as well. LADMPSAP is particularly
suitable for sparse representation and low-rank recovery problems because its
subproblems have closed form solutions and the sparsity and low-rankness of the
iterates can be preserved during the iteration. It is also highly
parallelizable and hence fits for parallel or distributed computing. Numerical
experiments testify to the advantages of LADMPSAP in speed and numerical
accuracy.

unperturbed Friedmann equations contain additional terms arising from the
bulk-brane interaction that implement non-singular bounces in the models with a
cosmological constant and non-interacting perfect fluids. The structure of the
phase-space of the models allows for two basic configurations, namely, one
bounce solutions or eternal universes. Assuming that the matter content of the
model is given by dust and radiation, we derive the dynamical field equations
for scalar hydrodynamical perturbations considering either a conformally flat
(de Sitter) bulk or a perturbed bulk. We perform a numerical analysis which can
shed some light on the study of cosmological scalar perturbations in bouncing
brane world models. From a mathematical point of view we show that although the
bounce enhances the amplitudes of scalar perturbations for one bounce models in
the case of a de Sitter bulk, the amplitudes of the perturbations remain
sufficiently small and bounded relative to the background values up to a
certain scale. For one bounce models in the case of a perturbed bulk the
amplitudes of all perturbations (apart from the Weyl fluid energy density)
remain sufficiently small and bounded relative to the background values for any
scale of the perturbations. We also discuss and compare the stability and
bounded behaviour of the perturbations in the late accelerated phase of one
bounce solutions. For eternal universes we argue that some of these features
are maintained only for early times (typically of the order of the first
bounce). In this sense we show that eternal solutions are highly unstable

we develop a new network metric capable of measuring order-four structure
which, when used alongside traditional network metrics, allows us to more

generating homogeneous networks with equal clustering we study and quantify

15%) are even retrograde with respect to the stellar spin axis. Motivated by
these observations, we explore the possibility of forming retrograde orbits in
hierarchical triple configurations consisting of a star-planet inner pair with
another giant planet, or brown dwarf, in a much wider orbit. Recently Naoz et
al. (2011) showed that in such a system, the inner planet's orbit can flip back
and forth from prograde to retrograde, and can also reach extremely high
eccentricities. Here we map a significant part of the parameter space of
dynamical outcomes for these systems. We derive strong constraints on the
orbital configurations for the outer perturber that could lead to the formation
of hot Jupiters with misaligned or retrograde orbits. We focus only on the
secular evolution, neglecting other dynamical effects such as mean-motion
resonances, as well as all dissipative forces. For example, with an inner
Jupiter-like planet initially on a nearly circular orbit at 5 AU, we show that
a misaligned hot Jupiter is likely to be formed in the presence of a more
massive planetary companion (> 2 MJ) within 140 AU of the inner system, with
mutual inclination 50 degrees and eccentricity above 0.25. This is in striking
contrast to the test-particle approximation, where an almost perpendicular
configuration can still cause large eccentricity excitations, but flips of an
inner Jupiter-like planet are much less likely to occur. The constraints we
derive can be used to guide future observations, and, in particular, searches
for more distant companions in systems containing a hot Jupiter.

the cases of the large Nf QCD within the conformal window (referred as
Conformal QCD) with an IR cutoff and small Nf QCD at T/Tc>1 with Tc being the
chiral transition temperature (referred as High Temperature QCD).
  Our numerical simulation on a lattice of the size 16^3 x 64 shows the
following evidence of the conjecture. In the conformal region we find the
vacuum is the nontrivial Z(3) twisted vacuum modified by non-perturbative
effects and temporal propagators of meson behave at large t as a power-law
corrected Yukawa-type decaying form. The transition from the conformal region
to the deconfining region or the confining region is a sharp transition between
different vacua and therefore it suggests a first order transition both in
Conformal QCD and in High Temperature QCD.
  Within our fixed lattice simulation, we find that there is a precise
correspondence between Conformal QCD and High Temperature QCD in the temporal
propagators under the change of the parameters Nf and T/Tc respectively. In
particular, we find the correspondence between Conformal QCD with Nf = 7 and
High Temperature QCD with Nf=2 at T ~ 2 Tc being in close relation to a meson
unparticle model. From this we estimate the anomalous mass dimension gamma* =
1.2 (1) for Nf=7. We also show that the asymptotic state in the limit T/Tc -->
infty is a free quark state in the Z(3) twisted vacuum.

constructed based on the definition of a wave as a multidimensional oscillator.
Waves are represented as abstract vectors $|\psi\rangle$ in the appropriately
defined space $\Psi$ with a Hermitian metric. The metric is usually
positive-definite but can be more general in the presence of negative-energy
waves (which are typically unstable and must not be confused with
negative-frequency waves). The very form of wave equations is derived from
properties of $\Psi$. The generic wave equation is shown to be a quantumlike
Schrodinger equation; hence one-to-one correspondence with the mathematical
framework of quantum mechanics is established, and the quantum-mechanical
machinery becomes applicable to classical waves ""as is"". The classical wave
action is defined as the density operator, $|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|$. The
coordinate and momentum spaces, not necessarily Euclidean, need not be
postulated but rather emerge when applicable. Various kinetic equations flow as
projections of the von Neumann equation for $|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|$. The
previously known action conservation theorems for noneikonal waves and the
conventional Wigner-Weyl-Moyal formalism are generalized and subsumed under a
unifying invariant theory. Whitham's equations are recovered as the
corresponding fluid limit in the geometrical-optics approximation. The
Liouville equation is also yielded as a special case, yet in a somewhat
different limit; thus ray tracing, and especially nonlinear ray tracing, is
found to be more subtle than commonly assumed. Applications of this
axiomatization are also discussed, briefly, for some characteristic equations.

different methods in calculating {\pi} by first deriving the various proofs to
each method and then creating graphical displays and tables with percentage
errors on each to allow a thorough comparison between each method. It is
important to realize that usually people refer to {\pi} as 3.142 and use this
shortened value in everyday calculations. However, most people in society do
not know that in some of NASAs calculations, must be calculated to 15 decimal
places (3.141592653589793) for calculations involving the Space Station
Guidance Navigation and Control (GNC) code [9]. Furthermore, some people use
the world renown constant everyday yet have no idea where it comes from.
  This thesis allows a thorough exploration of the different methods of
calculating pi by us- ing Mathematica to provide the necessary iterations
needed and Microsoft excel to plot the various graphs for convergence
comparisons. Finally, the conclusions that have come from this thesis
demonstrate that methods in which oscillations between the positive and
negative region of the line y = {\pi} slow down the rate of convergence and out
of the five methods investigated, The infinite series formulated from
{\zeta}(8) proves to be one of the fastest infinite series today to converge
towards {\pi}.

University, USA) suggested introducing a new mathematical constant related to
the golden ratio. He called it the chi ratio, as chi follows phi in the Greek
alphabet. Without going too much into the artistic considerations, which may be
subject to criticism similar to the golden ratio debunking, we focus on showing
that the chi ratio is interesting as a number as such, with remarkable
geometric properties, just as the golden ratio is.

  Gradient and Convergence",,,,"TR-IC-Quaternion-SP-01-08-2012","math.GM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A novel framework for a unifying treatment of quaternion valued adaptive
filtering algorithms is introduced. This is achieved based on a rigorous
account of quaternion differentiability, the proposed I-gradient, and the use
of augmented quaternion statistics to account for real world data with
noncircular probability distributions. We first provide an elegant solution for
the calculation of the gradient of real functions of quaternion variables
(typical cost function), an issue that has so far prevented systematic
development of quaternion adaptive filters. This makes it possible to unify the
class of existing and proposed quaternion least mean square (QLMS) algorithms,
and to illuminate their structural similarity. Next, in order to cater for both
circular and noncircular data, the class of widely linear QLMS (WL-QLMS)
algorithms is introduced and the subsequent convergence analysis unifies the
treatment of strictly linear and widely linear filters, for both proper and
improper sources. It is also shown that the proposed class of HR gradients
allows us to resolve the uncertainty owing to the noncommutativity of
quaternion products, while the involution gradient (I-gradient) provides
generic extensions of the corresponding real- and complex-valued adaptive
algorithms, at a reduced computational cost. Simulations in both the strictly
linear and widely linear setting support the approach.

measure. Many error measures have been proposed, but when demand is
intermittent some become inapplicable, some give counter-intuitive results, and
there is no agreement on which is best. We argue that almost all known measures
rank forecasters incorrectly on intermittent demand series. We propose several
new error measures with wider applicability, and correct forecaster ranking on
several intermittent demand patterns. We call these ""mean-based"" error measures
because they evaluate forecasts against the (possibly time-dependent) mean of
the underlying stochastic process instead of point demands.

of an ordered FePt monolayer deposited on Pt (111) surface has been
investigated. In the ground state, the pronounced anisotropic geometry of the
FePt layer with alternating Fe and Pt chains gives rise to a helimagnetic
structure with a strong difference in the helicity period along the chains and
perpendicular to them. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the
region of stable Skyrmion magnetic structures in the $B-T$ phase diagram has
been demonstrated via Monte Carlo simulations using the parameters obtained
within first-principles electronic structure calculations. The present study
demonstrates clearly that the ratio of the exchange coupling parameters J/D for
a deposited magnetic film - being of central importance for the formation of
Skyrmions - can be manipulated by growing an overlayer of 2-dimensional (2D)
compounds with the atoms carrying spontaneous magnetic moments separated by the
atoms of non-magnetic elements.

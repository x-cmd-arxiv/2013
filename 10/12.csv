understand how the relative arrangement of enzymes affects pathway function.
Here we investigate the effect of enzyme localization on the flux of a minimal
two-enzyme pathway within a reaction-diffusion model. We consider different
reaction kinetics, spatial dimensions, and loss mechanisms for intermediate
substrate molecules. Our systematic analysis of the different regimes of this
model reveals both universal features and distinct characteristics in the
phenomenology of these different systems. In particular, the distribution of
the second pathway enzyme that maximizes the reaction flux undergoes a generic
transition from co-localization with the first enzyme when the catalytic
efficiency of the second enzyme is low, to an extended profile when the
catalytic efficiency is high. However, the critical transition point and the
shape of the extended optimal profile is significantly affected by specific
features of the model. We explain the behavior of these different systems in
terms of the underlying stochastic reaction and diffusion processes of single
substrate molecules.

ices besides H2O and CO, but the most favorable path to CO2 ice is still
unclear. Molecular dynamics calculations on the ultraviolet photodissociation
of different kinds of CO-H2O ice systems have been performed at 10 K in order
to demonstrate that the reaction between CO and an OH molecule resulting from
H2O photodissociation through the first excited state is a possible route to
form CO2 ice. However, our calculations, which take into account different ice
surface models, suggest that there is another product with a higher formation
probability ((3.00+-0.07)x10-2), which is the HOCO complex, whereas the
formation of CO2 has a probability of only (3.6+-0.7)x10-4. The initial
location of the CO is key to obtain reaction and form CO2: the CO needs to be
located deep into the ice. The HOCO complex becomes trapped in the cold ice
surface in the trans-HOCO minimum because it quickly loses its internal energy
to the surrounding ice, preventing further reaction to H + CO2. Several
laboratory experiments have been carried out recently and they confirm that CO2
can also be formed through other, different routes. Here we compare our
theoretical results with the data available from experi- ments studying the
formation of CO2 through a similar pathway as ours, even though the initial
conditions were not exactly the same. Our results also show that the HCO van
der Waals complex can be formed through the interaction of CO with the H atom
that is formed as a product of H2O photodissociation. Thus, the reaction of the
H atom photofragment following H2O photodissociation with CO can be a possible
route to form HCO ice.

of the universe can be retrieved via a simple cell count analysis of the 3D

clustering ratio} $\eta$, is the key in this process. This is defined as the
ratio between one- and two-point second-order moments of the smoothed galaxy
density distribution. The distinguishing feature of this statistic is its
universality: on large cosmic scales both galaxies (in redshift space) and mass
(in real space) display the same $\eta$ amplitude. This quantity, in addition,
does not evolve as a function of redshift. As a consequence, the $\eta$
statistic provides insight into characteristic parameters of the real-space
power spectrum of mass density fluctuations without the need to specify the
galaxy biasing function, a model for galaxy redshift distortions nor the
growing mode of density ripples. We demonstrate the method with the luminous
red galaxy (LRG) sample extracted from the spectroscopic Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) data release 7 (DR7) catalogue. Taking weak (flat) priors of the
curvature of the universe ($\Omega_k$) and of the constant value of the dark

index of primordial density perturbations $n_s$, we estimate the abundance of
matter with a relative error of 8% ($\Omega_m= 0.283\pm0.023$). We expect that

lacking any spectral information and we are still in need of ground-based
spectroscopic and/or multicolour photometric follow-up observations for a solid
interpretation. Both faintness of most of the observed stars and the required
high S/N of spectroscopic data imply the need of using large telescopes, access
to which is limited. In this paper, we look for an alternative, and aim for the
development of a technique allowing to denoise the originally low S/N
spectroscopic data, making observations of faint targets with small telescopes
possible and effective. We present a generalization of the original
Least-Squares Deconvolution (LSD) method by implementing a multicomponent
average profile and a line strengths correction algorithm. The method was
successfully tested on the high resolution spectra of Vega and a Kepler star,
KIC04749989. Application to the two pulsating stars, 20 Cvn and HD189631,
showed that the technique is also applicable to intrinsically variable stars:
the results of frequency analysis and mode identification from the LSD model
spectra for both objects are in good agreement with the findings from
literature. Depending on S/N of the original data and spectral characteristics
of a star, the gain in S/N in the LSD model spectrum typically ranges from 5 to
15 times. The restored LSD model spectra contain all the information on line
profile variations present in the original spectra. The method is applicable to
both high- (>30 000) and low- (<30 000) resolution spectra, though the

test is unique to Gamow-Teller transitions, as was shown in the framework of a
recently developed theory that assumes a Lorentz symmetry breaking background
field of tensor nature. The nuclear spins were polarized in the up and down

degree of mixing of the solvent phase into the core of the particles occurs for
the miscible system. At smaller volumes complete film formation is observed and

Following recent studies suggesting that the functional organization of brain
networks can be altered in comatose patients, this work analyzes brain
functional connectivity (FC) networks obtained from resting-state functional
magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Two approaches are used to estimate the
FC: the Partial Correlation (PC) and the Transfer Entropy (TE). Both the PC and
the TE show significant statistical differences between the group of patients

suggest two possible rs-fMRI markers useful to design new strategies for the

dust attenuation within rest-frame UV-selected samples at z~ 4, 3, and 1.5. We
measure by stacking at 250, 350, and 500 um in the Herschel/SPIRE images from
the HerMES program the average infrared luminosity as a function of stellar
mass and UV luminosity. We find that dust attenuation is mostly correlated with
stellar mass. There is also a secondary dependence with UV luminosity: at a
given UV luminosity, dust attenuation increases with stellar mass, while at a
given stellar mass it decreases with UV luminosity. We provide new empirical
recipes to correct for dust attenuation given the observed UV luminosity and
the stellar mass. Our results also enable us to put new constraints on the
average relation between star formation rate and stellar mass at z~ 4, 3, and
1.5. The star formation rate-stellar mass relations are well described by power
laws (SFR~ M^0.7), with the amplitudes being similar at z~4 and z~3, and
decreasing by a factor of 4 at z~1.5 at a given stellar mass. We further
investigate the evolution with redshift of the specific star formation rate.
Our results are in the upper range of previous measurements, in particular at
z~3, and are consistent with a plateau at 3<z<4. Current model predictions

values, as they yield lower predictions than the observations in the redshift
range we explore. We use these results to discuss the star formation histories
of galaxies in the framework of the Main Sequence of star-forming galaxies. Our
results suggest that galaxies at high redshift (2.5<z<4) stay around 1 Gyr on
the Main Sequence. With decreasing redshift, this time increases such that z=1

in both generalized gradient and local density approximations (GGA and LDA).
The structural, electronic, optical and elastic properties were calculated in
the pressure range from 0 to 10 GPa, below the pressure of phase transition for
this compound. One of the main results of the paper is that the previously
encountered in the literature controversy regarding the character of the
CdIn2S4 band gap was resolved in favor of the indirect gap. Pressure
coefficient of the band gap estimated as 0.071/0.063 eV/GPa (GGA/LDA) is in
excellent agreement with the found in the literature experimental data of 0.076
or 0.069 eV/GPa. Calculated pressure dependence of the unit cell volume follows
the experimental results very closely. Dependence of the interionic distances,
lattice parameter and all elastic constants on pressure was calculated. Refined
estimations of the Debye temperature for CdIn2S4 are given as 280 K (LDA) and
252 K (GGA). Elastic anisotropy of CdIn2S4 was visualized by plotting
three-dimensional dependence of the Young modulus on a direction in the crystal
lattice; it was established that the lowest Young moduli values are realized if
the external stress is applied along the crystallographic axes.

by measuring certain check operators which yield an error syndrome, and the

energy, and the spectral index of the electron distribution on the soft X-rays

the non-thermal energy $E^{\alpha}$ for $\alpha \approx 1.7$ in the low energy
passband (1-8 \AA) and $\approx 1.6$ in the high energy passband (0.5-4 \AA);
(2) the GOES class is only weakly dependent on the spectral index in both

\AA\ passband, but decrease the flux in the 1-8 \AA\ passband, while decreases
in the cut-off will cause a decrease in the 0.5-4 \AA\ passband and a slight

each time slot (TS) of the broadcast phase, a ""best"" user is selected for

feedback information to achieve CD. We demonstrate that the

existing schemes, where more TSs are allocated for direct transmission in order
to jointly exploit CD and MUD. Our analytical and numerical results show that
the US-LCRP constitutes a more efficient resource utilization approach than the

{\em flow-sparsifier}, i.e., a small network $H$ that supports the same flows
as $G$, up to a factor $q \geq 1$ called the quality of sparsifier.
Specifically, we assume the network $G$ contains a set of $k$ terminals $T$,
shared with the network $H$, i.e., $T\subseteq V(G)\cap V(H)$, and we want $H$
to preserve all multicommodity flows that can be routed between the terminals
$T$. The challenge is to construct $H$ that is small.
  These questions have received a lot of attention in recent years, leading to
some known tradeoffs between the sparsifier's quality $q$ and its size
$|V(H)|$. Nevertheless, it remains an outstanding question whether every $G$
admits a flow-sparsifier $H$ with quality $q=1+\epsilon$, or even $q=O(1)$, and
size $|V(H)|\leq f(k,\epsilon)$ (in particular, independent of $|V(G)|$ and the
edge capacities). Making a first step in this direction, we present new
constructions for several scenarios:
  * Our main result is that for quasi-bipartite networks $G$, one can construct
a $(1+\epsilon)$-flow-sparsifier of size $\poly(k/\eps)$. In contrast, exact
($q=1$) sparsifiers for this family of networks are known to require size
$2^{\Omega(k)}$.
  * For networks $G$ of bounded treewidth $w$, we construct a flow-sparsifier
with quality $q=O(\log w / \log\log w)$ and size $O(w\cdot \poly(k))$.
  * For general networks $G$, we construct a {\em sketch} $sk(G)$, that stores
all the feasible multicommodity flows up to factor $q=1+\eps$, and its size
(storage requirement) is $f(k,\epsilon)$.

important tool in understanding their impact on structure formation, especially

which the time evolution of perturbations in the scalar fields is discarded. We
show that this approximation must be used with some care by studying linearly
perturbed scalar field cosmologies and quantifying the errors that arise from
taking the quasi-static limit. We focus on f(R) and chameleon models and link
the accuracy of the quasi-static approximation to the fast/slow-roll behaviour
of the background and its proximity to {\Lambda}CDM. Investigating a large
range of scales, from super- to sub-horizon, we find that slow-rolling
({\Lambda}CDM-like) backgrounds generically result in good quasi-static
behaviour, even on (super-)horizon scales. We also discuss how the
approximation might affect studying the non-linear growth of structure in
numerical N-body simulations.

space and model both clusters with primordial substructure, and those with
smooth profiles. We also adopt different initial virial ratios - from cool,
collapsing clusters to warm, expanding associations. In each cluster we place
the same stellar population; the clusters each have 2100 stars, and contain one
massive 25M_Sun star which is expected to explode as a supernova at about
6.6Myr. We determine the number of Solar (G)-type stars that are within 0.1 -
0.3pc of the 25M_Sun star at the time of the supernova, which is the distance
required to enrich the protoplanetary disc with the 26-Al abundances found in

`singletons'; stars which are never in close binaries, nor suffer sub-100au
encounters, and which also do not suffer strong dynamical perturbations.
  The evolution of a suite of twenty initially identical clusters is highly
stochastic, with the supernova enriching over 10 G-dwarfs in some clusters, and
none at all in others. Typically only ~25 per cent of clusters contain
enriched, unperturbed singletons, and usually only 1 - 2 per cluster (from a
total of 96 G-dwarfs in each cluster). The initial conditions for star
formation do not strongly affect the results, although a higher fraction of
supervirial (expanding) clusters would contain enriched G-dwarfs if the
supernova occurred earlier than 6.6Myr. If we sum together simulations with
identical initial conditions, then ~1 per cent of all G-dwarfs in our

CFT description, the Kondo effect is a renormalization group flow triggered by
a marginally relevant (0+1)-dimensional operator between two fixed points with
the same Kac-Moody current algebra. In the large-N limit, with spin SU(N) and
charge U(1) symmetries, the Kondo effect appears as a (0+1)-dimensional
second-order mean-field transition in which the U(1) charge symmetry is
spontaneously broken. Our holographic model, which combines the CFT and large-N
descriptions, is a Chern-Simons gauge field in (2+1)-dimensional AdS space,
AdS3, dual to the Kac-Moody current, coupled to a holographic superconductor
along an AdS2 subspace. Our model exhibits several characteristic features of
the Kondo effect, including a dynamically generated scale, a resistivity with
power-law behavior in temperature at low temperatures, and a spectral flow
producing a phase shift. Our holographic Kondo model may be useful for studying

into the ISM as cosmic rays and neglect the additional deposition of thermal
energy or momentum. With a typical Galactic diffusion coefficient for CRs (3e28
cm^2 / s) we demonstrate that this process alone can trigger the local
formation of a strong low density galactic wind maintaining vertically open
field lines. Driven by the additional pressure gradient of the relativistic
fluid the wind speed can exceed 1000 km/s, much higher than the escape velocity
of the galaxy. The global mass loading, i.e. the ratio of the gas mass leaving
the galactic disk in a wind to the star formation rate becomes of order unity
once the system has settled into an equilibrium. We conclude that relativistic
particles accelerated in supernova remnants alone provide a natural and
efficient mechanism to trigger winds similar to observed mass-loaded galactic
winds in high-redshift galaxies. These winds also help explaining the low
efficiencies for the conversion of gas into stars in galaxies as well as the
early enrichment of the intergalactic medium with metals. This mechanism can be
at least of similar importance than the traditionally considered momentum

improvement over previous similar work, particularly in terms of chemical
abundances. Its primary purpose is to enable detailed evaluations of and
refinements to stellar population synthesis models designed to recover the
above information for unresolved stellar systems based on their integrated
spectra. However, since the Schiavon sample spans a wide range of the known GGC
parameter space, our compilation may also benefit investigations related to a
variety of astrophysical endeavours, such as the early formation of the Milky
Way, the chemical evolution of GGCs, and stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis.
For instance, we confirm with our compiled data that the GGC system has a
bimodal metallicity distribution and is uniformly enhanced in the
alpha-elements. When paired with the ages of our clusters, we find evidence
that supports a scenario whereby the Milky Way obtained its globular clusters
through two channels, in situ formation and accretion of satellite galaxies.
The distributions of C, N, O, and Na abundances and the dispersions thereof per
cluster corroborate the known fact that all GGCs studied so far with respect to
multiple stellar populations have been found to harbour them. Finally, using
data on individual stars, we also confirm that the atmospheres of stars become
progressively polluted by CN(O)-processed material after they leave the main
sequence and uncover evidence which suggests the alpha-elements Mg and Ca may
originate from more than one nucleosynthetic production site. [abridged]

using low-resolution (R = 2000) stellar spectra from the SDSS and SEGUE. By
means of a star-by-star comparison with a set of SDSS/SEGUE spectra with
available estimates of [C/Fe] based on published high-resolution analyses, we
demonstrate that we can measure [C/Fe] from SDSS/SEGUE spectra with S/N > 15 to
a precision better than 0.35 dex. Using the measured carbon-to-iron abundance
ratios obtained by this technique, we derive the frequency of carbon-enhanced
stars ([C/Fe] > +0.7) as a function of [Fe/H], for both the SDSS/SEGUE stars
and other samples from the literature. We find that the differential frequency
slowly rises from almost zero to about 14% at [Fe/H] ~ -2.4, followed by a
sudden increase, by about a factor of three, to 39% from [Fe/H] ~ -2.4 to
[Fe/H] ~ -3.7. We also examine how the cumulative frequency of CEMP stars
varies across different luminosity classes. The giant sample exhibits a
cumulative CEMP frequency of 32% for [Fe/H] < -2.5, 31% for [Fe/H] < -3.0, and
33% for [Fe/H] < -3.5. For the main-sequence turnoff stars, we obtain a lower
cumulative CEMP frequency, around 10% for [Fe/H] < -2.5. The dwarf population
displays a large change in the cumulative frequency for CEMP stars below [Fe/H]

C-rich material in stars that have undergone mixing with CNO-processed material

agreement between the observed CEMP frequencies for stars with [Fe/H] > -1.5

Thus, while the adopted AGB model works well for low-mass progenitor stars, it
does not do so for high-mass progenitors. Our results imply that the IMF
shifted from high- to low-mass dominated in the early history of the Milky Way,

the temperature and polarization spectra of the cosmic microwave background

interacting DM as well as the strength of its interaction with DR. Like nearly
all knowledge we have gleaned about dark matter since inferring its existence
this constraint rests on the betrayal by gravity of the location of otherwise
invisible dark matter. Although our results can be straightforwardly applied to
a broad class of models that couple dark matter particles to various light

interacting component as dark atoms coupled to a bath of dark photons. We find
that linear cosmological data and CMB lensing put strong constraints on

strongly interacting with DR. We show that our results are surprisingly
constraining for the recently proposed Double-disk DM model, a novel example of

early-type galaxies (ETGs) can be explained as a combination of dry mergers and
progenitor bias, at least since z\sim1. In this paper we carry out a new test
of the dry-merger scenario based on recent lensing measurements of the
evolution of the mass density profile of ETGs. We construct a theoretical model
for the joint evolution of the size and mass density profile slope \gamma'
driven by dry mergers occurring at rates given by cosmological simulations.
Such dry-merger model predicts a strong decrease of \gamma' with cosmic time,
inconsistent with the almost constant \gamma' inferred from observations in the
redshift range 0<z<1. We then show with a simple toy model that a modest amount
of cold gas in the mergers -- consistent with the upper limits on recent star
formation in ETGs -- is sufficient to reconcile the model with measurements of
\gamma'. By fitting for the amount of gas accreted during mergers, we find that
models with dissipation are consistent with observations of the evolution in
both size and density slope, if \sim4% of the total final stellar mass arises
from the gas accreted since z\sim1. Purely dry merger models are ruled out at >
99% CL. We thus suggest a scenario where the outer regions of massive ETGs grow
by accretion of stars and dark matter, while small amounts of dissipation and
nuclear star formation conspire to keep the mass density profile constant and
approximately isothermal.

high degree of linear polarization of some chromospheric spectral lines
observed in solar flares. The standard explanation of these measurements is in
terms of the impact polarization caused by non-thermal proton and/or electron
beams. In this work, we study the possible role of resonance line polarization
due to radiation anisotropy in the inhomogeneous medium of the flare ribbons.
We consider a simple two-dimensional model of the flaring chromosphere and we
solve self-consistently the non-LTE problem taking into account the role of
resonant scattering polarization and of the Hanle effect. Our calculations show
that the horizontal plasma inhomogeneities at the boundary of the flare ribbons
can lead to a significant radiation anisotropy in the line formation region
and, consequently, to a fractional linear polarization of the emergent
radiation of the order of several percent. Neglecting the effects of impact
polarization, our model can provide a clue for resolving some of the common
observational findings, namely: (1) why a high degree of polarization appears
mainly at the edges of the flare ribbons; (2) why polarization can also be
observed during the gradual phase of a flare; (3) why polarization is mostly
radial or tangential. We conclude that the radiation transfer in the realistic
multi-dimensional models of solar flares needs to be considered as an essential
ingredient for understanding the observed spectral line polarization.

major axis running parallel to the trench. Larger trenches lead to more oblong
craters. In the second method, a hose beneath the surface of the sand injects
nitrogen gas. The pressure of the gas counters the hydrostatic pressure of the

coefficients fixed as above. Finally, we show that
\mathcal{V}_2(d,0)=\mu_d^2\,q^2+\mathcal{O}(q), where \mathcal{V}_2(d,0)

reduces the questions to estimate the number of Fq--rational points with
pairwise--distinct coordinates of a certain family of complete intersections
defined over Fq. A critical point for our results is an analysis of the
singular locus of the varieties under consideration, which allows to obtain
rather precise estimates on the corresponding number of Fq--rational points.

large-scale turbulent structures. As the wakes of the wind turbines advect

dynamic computation systems possess evolutionary rules dependent on a
neighborhood of adjacent cells, which limits their sampling radius and the
environments that they can be used in.
  The purpose of this study was to explore the complex nature of
one-dimensional CA in configurations other than that of the standard ECA.
Namely, ""long-distance cellular automata"" (LDCA), a construct that had been
described in the past, but never studied. I experimented with a class of LDCA
that used spaced sample cells unlike ECA, and were described by the notation
LDCA-x-y-n, where x and y represented the amount of spacing between the cell
and its left and right neighbors, and n denoted the length of the initial tape
for tapes of finite size. Some basic characteristics of ECA are explored in
this paper, such as seemingly universal behavior, the prevalence of complexity
with varying neighborhoods, and qualitative behavior as a function of x and y
spacing.
  Focusing mainly on purely Class 4 behavior in LDCA-1-2, I found that Rule 73
could potentially be Turing universal through the emulation of a cyclic tag
system, and revealed a connection between the mathematics of binary trees and
Eulerian numbers that might provide insight into unsolved problems in both

typically much larger than the number of edges, suggesting considerable

a change of state on a single edge) suffice to recover the branch lengths of

holds provided the branch lengths are sufficiently short, by applying the

Lyman Limit (LL) and Damped Lyman-{\alpha} (DLA) systems are ~10 and ~1 proper
kpc, respectively. If normalized to the size of the halo of the nearest central
galaxy, the median impact parameters for LL and DLA systems become ~1 and
~10^-1 virial radii, respectively. At a given HI column density, the impact
parameter increases with the mass of the closest galaxy, in agreement with
observations. We predict most strong HI absorbers to be most closely associated
with extremely low-mass galaxies, M_star < 10^8 M_sun and star formation rate
<10^-1 M_sun/yr. We also find a correlation between the column density of
absorbers and the mass of the nearest galaxy. This correlation is most
pronounced for DLAs with N_HI > 10^21 /cm^2 which are typically close to
galaxies with M_star >~ 10^9 M_sun. Similar correlations exist between column
density and other properties of the associated galaxies such as their star
formation rates, halo masses and HI content. The galaxies nearest to HI
absorbers are typically far too faint to be detectable with current
instrumentation, which is consistent with the high rate of (often unpublished)
non-detections in observational searches for the galaxy counterparts of strong
HI absorbers. Moreover, we predict that the detected nearby galaxies are
typically not the galaxies that are most closely associated with the absorbers,
thus causing the impact parameters, star formation rates and stellar masses of
the observed counterparts to be biased high.

the direct integration of the relaxed Einstein equations formalism,

for the equations of motion in these theories. The self-gravity of the compact
objects is treated with an approach developed by Eardley. The scalar field
causes deviations from the general relativistic waveform that depend only on a
small number of parameters. Among the effects of the scalar field are new
hereditary terms which depend on the past history of the source. One of these,
a dipole-dipole coupling, produces a zero-frequency ""gravitational-wave memory""
equivalent to the Christodoulou memory of general relativity. In the special
case of two black holes, the waveform reduces to the general relativistic
waveform. For a mixed (black hole-neutron star) system, the waveform is
identical to that of Einstein's theory to first post-Newtonian order, with
deviations at higher order depending only on a single parameter. The behavior
in these cases matches that found for the equations of motion.

anti-glitch was recently reported for the magnetar 1E 2259+586. In this case,
the magnetar clearly exhibited a sudden spin-down, strongly challenging

that the sudden spin-down can be naturally accounted for. The observed hard

accreting filaments. It is based on one hand on the virial equilibrium of the
central part of the filament and on the other hand on energy balance between
the turbulence driven by accretion onto the filament and dissipation. We
consider two dissipation mechanisms the turbulent cascade and the ion-neutral
friction. Our model predicts that the width of the filament inner part is
almost independent of the column density and leads to values comparable to what
is inferred observationally if dissipation is due to ion-neutral friction. On
the contrary turbulent dissipation leads to a structure that is bigger and
depends significantly on the column density. Our model provides a reasonable

is modified by an additional term for the inflaton field in the Kahler
potential. This term not only breaks one SU(N,1) symmetry explicitly, but also
plays an important role for inflation. We generalize the superpotential in the
no-scale ripple inflation model slightly. There exists a discrete Z_2
symmetry/parity in the scalar potential in general, which can be preserved or
violated by the non-canonical nomalized inflaton kinetic term. Thus, there are
three inflation paths: one parity invariant path, and the left and right paths
for parity violating scenario. We show that the inflations along the parity
invariant path and right path are consistent with the Planck results. However,
the gavitino mass for the parity invariant path is so large that the inflation
results will be invalid if we consider the inflaton supersymmetry breaking soft
mass term. Thus, only the inflation along the right path gives the correct and
consistent results. Notably, the tensor-to-scalar ratio in such case can be
large, with a value around 0.05, which may be probed by the future Planck
experiment.

survey area with a fixed observing time and pixel count, images from surveys
such as the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) or Euclid will
necessarily be undersampled and therefore distorted by aliasing. Oversampled,
unaliased images can be obtained by combining multiple, dithered exposures of
the same source with a suitable reconstruction algorithm. Any such
reconstruction must minimally distort the reconstructed images for weak lensing
analyses to be unbiased. In this paper, we use the IMage COMbination (IMCOM)
algorithm of Rowe, Hirata, and Rhodes to investigate the effect of image
combination on shape measurements (size and ellipticity). We simulate dithered
images of sources with varying amounts of ellipticity and undersampling,
reconstruct oversampled output images from them using IMCOM, and measure shape
distortions in the output. Our simulations show that IMCOM creates no
significant distortions when the relative offsets between dithered images are
precisely known. Distortions increase with the uncertainty in those offsets but
become problematic only with relatively poor astrometric precision. E.g. for
images similar to those from the Astrophysics Focused Telescope Asset (AFTA)
implementation of WFIRST, combining eight undersampled images (sampling ratio
Q=1) with highly pessimistic uncertainty in astrometric registration
(\sigma_d~10^{-3} pixels) yields an RMS shear error of O(10^{-4}). Our analysis
pipeline is adapted from that of the Precision Projector Laboratory -- a joint
project between NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Caltech which characterizes
image sensors using laboratory emulations of astronomical data.

is transported to the disk atmosphere by turbulence and destroyed by
photoreactions to produce atomic oxygen, while the atomic oxygen is transported
to the midplane and reforms water and/or other molecules. We find that this
cycle significantly decreases column densities of water ice at r < 30 AU, where
dust temperatures are too high to reform water ice effectively. The radial
extent of such region depends on the desorption energy of atomic hydrogen. Our
model indicates that water ice could be deficient even outside the sublimation
radius. Outside this radius, the cycle decreases the D/H ratio of water ice
from 2x10^-2, which is set by the collapsing core model, to 10^-4-10^-2 in 10^6
yr, without significantly decreasing the water ice column density. The
resultant D/H ratios depend on the strength of mixing and the radial distance
from the central star. Our finding suggests that the D/H ratio of cometary
water (10^-3-10^-4) could be established (i.e. cometary water could be formed)
in the solar nebula, even if the D/H ratio of water ice delivered to the disk

are no more invariant under a global shift of energy levels, showing a breaking

almost edge-on and rotates around the AGN. Since the minor axis of the dust
lane is nearly parallel to the radio jets emerging from the AGN, the disk is
probably feeding its gas into the central black hole. From the absorption, we
estimate the hydrogen column density of the lane is N_H=2.0 x 10^21 cm^-2, and
the mass of the disk is ~8 x 10^7 M_sun. The column density is consistent with

and fault diagnosis in distributed parameter systems and particularly in
dynamical systems described by partial differential equations of the nonlinear
wave type. At a first stage, a nonlinear filtering approach for estimating the
dynamics of a 1D nonlinear wave equation, from measurements provided from a
small number of sensors is developed. It is shown that the numerical solution
of the associated partial differential equation results into a set of nonlinear
ordinary differential equations. With the application of diffeomorphism that is
based on differential flatness theory it is shown that an equivalent
description of the system is obtained in the linear canonical (Brunovsky) form.
This transformation enables to obtain local estimates about the state vector of
the system through the application of the standard Kalman Filter recursion. At
a second stage, the local statistical approach to fault diagnosis is used to
perform fault diagnosis for the distributed parameters system by processing
with elaborated statistical tools the differences (residuals) between the
output of the Kalman Filter and the measurements obtained from the distributed
parameter system. Optimal selection of the fault threshold is succeeded by
using the local statistical approach to fault diagnosis. The efficiency of the
proposed filtering approach for performing fault diagnosis in distributed

on a given graph, we focus on a bounded (connected) region of the graph and
coarse-grain it to a single vertex using a gauge-fixing procedure. We discuss
the ambiguities in the gauge-fixing procedure and their consequences for
coarse-graining spin(or) networks. This allows to define the boundary
deformations of that region in a gauge-invariant fashion and to identify the
area preserving deformations as U(N) transformations similarly to the already
well-studied case of a single intertwiner. The novelty is that the closure
constraint is now relaxed and the closure defect interpreted as a local measure
of the curvature inside the coarse-grained region. It is nevertheless possible
to cancel the closure defect by a Lorentz boost. We further identify a
Lorentz-invariant observable related to the area and closure defect, which we
name ""rest area"". Its physical meaning remains an open issue.

algorithm to automated segmentation (i.e. delineation) of organ limits for the
prostate central gland. The ultimate goal is to apply automated segmentation
approach to facilitate efficient MR-guided biopsy and radiation treatment

spherical template. Therefore, rays are sent through the surface points of a
polyhedron to sample the graph's nodes. After graph construction - which only
requires the center of the polyhedron defined by the user and located inside
the prostate center gland - the minimal cost closed set on the graph is
computed via a polynomial time s-t-cut, which results in the segmentation of
the prostate center gland's boundaries and volume. The algorithm has been
realized as a C++ modul within the medical research platform MeVisLab and the
ground truth of the central gland boundaries were manually extracted by
clinical experts (interventional radiologists) with several years of experience
in prostate treatment. For evaluation the automated segmentations of the
proposed scheme have been compared with the manual segmentations, yielding an

strong that all the other forces (including the Coulomb one) could be
neglected. Compressed baryonic matter is then produced after supernova,
manifesting itself as pulsar-like stars observed. The study of this compressed
baryonic matter can not only be meaningful in fundamental physics (e.g., the
elementary color interaction at low-energy scale, testing gravity theories,
detecting nano-Hertz background gravitational waves), but has also profound
implications in engineering applications (including time standard and
navigation), and additionally, is focused by Chinese advanced telescopes,
either terrestrial or in space. Historically, in 1930s, L. Landau speculated
that dense matter at supra-nuclear density in stellar cores could be considered
as gigantic nuclei (the prototype of standard model of neutron star), however,

Stampacchia truncation arguments and a new cut-off test function.
Nonlogarithmic entropy inequalities yield gradient estimates which allow for
the limit of vanishing time step sizes. Exploiting the entropy inequality, the

PDR-1 catalogue, to constrain the cosmological model through a measurement of
the galaxy {\it clustering ratio} $\eta_{g,R}$. This statistic has favourable
properties, being defined as the ratio of two quantities characterizing the
smoothed density field in spheres of given radius $R$: the value of its
correlation function on a multiple of this scale, $\xi(nR)$, and its variance
$\sigma^2(R)$. For sufficiently large values of $R$, this is a universal
number, capturing 2-point clustering information independently of the linear
bias and linear redshift-space distortions of the specific galaxy tracers. In
this paper we discuss in detail how to extend the application of $\eta_{g,R}$
to quasi-linear scales and how to control and remove observational selection
effects which are typical of redshift surveys as VIPERS. We verify the accuracy
and efficiency of these procedures using mock catalogues that match the survey
selection process. These results evidence the robustness of $\eta_{g,R}$ to
non-linearities and observational effects, which is related to its very
definition as a ratio of quantities that are similarly affected.
  We measure $\Omega_{m,0}=0.270_{-0.025}^{+0.029}$. In addition to the great
precision achieved on our estimation of $\Omega_m$ using VIPERS PDR-1, this
result is remarkable because it appears to be in good agreement with a recent
estimate $z\simeq 0.3$, obtained applying the same technique to the SDSS-LRG
catalogue. It, therefore, suports the robustness of the present analysis.
Moreover, the combination of these two measurements at $z\sim 0.3$ and $z\sim
0.9$ provides us with a very precise estimate $\Omega_{m,0}=0.274\pm0.017$
which highlights the great consistency between our estimation and other
cosmological probes such as BAOs, CMB and Supernovae.

these searches. Here we review the recent advances on Micromegas detectors used
in the CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) and proposed for the future
International Axion Observatory (IAXO). The most recent Micromegas setups in
CAST have achieved background levels of 1.5$\times10^{-6}$\ckcs, a factor of
more than 100 lower than the ones obtained by the first generation of CAST
detectors. This improvement is due to the development of active and passive
shielding techniques, offline discrimination techniques allowed by highly
granular readout patterns, as well as the use of radiopure detector components.
The status of the intensive R&D to reduce the background levels will be
described, including the operation of replica detectors in test benches and the
detailed Geant4 simulation of the detector setup and the detector response,
which has allowed the progressive understanding of background origins. The best
levels currently achieved in a test setup operating in the Canfranc Underground
Laboratory (LSC) are as low as $\sim10^{-7}$\ckcs, showing the good prospects
of this technology for application in the future IAXO.

that there is a crossover between satisfiable and unsatisfiable phases which
converts to an abrupt phase transition in a properly defined thermodynamic

performance of interference limited wireless networks. In this paper, we
introduce novel interference mitigation schemes for wireless cellular networks
with space division multiple access (SDMA). The schemes are based on a virtual
layer that captures and simplifies the complicated interference situation in
the network and that is used for power control. We show how optimization in
this virtual layer generates gradually adapting power control settings that
lead to autonomous interference minimization. Thereby, the granularity of
control ranges from controlling frequency sub-band power via controlling the
power on a per-beam basis, to a granularity of only enforcing average power
constraints per beam. In conjunction with suitable short-term scheduling, our
algorithms gradually steer the network towards a higher utility. We use
extensive system-level simulations to compare three distributed algorithms and
evaluate their applicability for different user mobility assumptions. In
particular, it turns out that larger gains can be achieved by imposing average
power constraints and allowing opportunistic scheduling instantaneously, rather
than controlling the power in a strict way. Furthermore, we introduce a
centralized algorithm, which directly solves the underlying optimization and
shows fast convergence, as a performance benchmark for the distributed
solutions. Moreover, we investigate the deviation from global optimality by
comparing to a branch-and-bound-based solution.

distributions and radial profiles of age, metallicity, dust attenuation, and
star formation timescale in the form of the Sandage star formation history are
obtained. When fitting with the models, we use the IRX-$A_\mathrm{FUV}$
relation, found to depend on a second parameter of birth rate b (ratio of
present and past-averaged star formation rate), to constrain the dust
attenuation. There are obvious parameter gradients in the disk of M101, which
supports the theory of an ""inside-out disk"" growth scenario. Two distinct disc
regions with different gradients of age and color are discovered, similar to
another late-type galaxy NGC 628. The metallicity gradient of the stellar
content is flatter than that of H {\sc ii} regions. The stellar disk is
optically thicker inside than outside and the global dust attenuation of this
galaxy is lower, compared with galaxies of similar and earlier morphological
type. We highlight that a variational star formation timescale describes the
real star formation history of a galaxy. The timescale increases steadily from
the center to the outskirt. We also confirm that the bulge in this galaxy is a
disk-like pseudobulge, whose evolution is likely to be induced by some secular
processes of the small bar with relatively young age, rich metal, and much
dust.

negative abundance gradients today provide a boundary condition for galaxy

to whether abundance gradients steepen or flatten with time remains highly
contradictory. We made use of a suite of L* discs, realised with and without
`enhanced' feedback. All the simulations were produced using the smoothed
particle hydrodynamics code Gasoline, and their in situ gas-phase metallicity
gradients traced from redshift z~2 to the present-day. Present-day
age-metallicity relations and metallicity distribution functions were derived
for each system. The `enhanced' feedback models, which have been shown to be in
agreement with a broad range of empirical scaling relations, distribute energy
and re-cycled ISM material over large scales and predict the existence of
relatively `flat' and temporally invariant abundance gradients. Enhanced
feedback schemes reduce significantly the scatter in the local stellar
age-metallicity relation and, especially, the [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] relation. The local
[O/Fe] distribution functions for our L* discs show clear bimodality, with
peaks at [O/Fe]=-0.05 and +0.05 (for stars with [Fe/H]>-1), consistent with our
earlier work on dwarf discs. Our results with `enhanced' feedback are
inconsistent with our earlier generation of simulations realised with
`conservative' feedback. We conclude that spatially-resolved metallicity
distributions, particularly at high-redshift, offer a unique and under-utilised
constraint on the uncertain nature of stellar feedback processes.

studied at various wavelengths and resolutions. We aim to study the pc-scale
properties of their synchrotron emission and, in particular, to determine their
core properties. We performed observations in the Very Long Baseline
Interferometry (VLBI) technique, using both the European VLBI Network (EVN) at
5 GHz, and the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at 5 and 8.4 GHz to map the
pc-scale structure of the brightest radio-loud objects of our sample, allowing
a proper morphological interpretation. A variety of morphologies have been
found: 9 BAL QSOs on a total of 11 observed sources have a resolved structure.
Core-jet, double, and symmetric objects are present, suggesting different
orientations. In some cases the sources can be young GPS or CSS. The projected
linear size of the sources, also considering observations from our previous
work for the same objects, can vary from tens of pc to hundreds of kpc. In some
cases, a diffuse emission can be supposed from the missing flux-density with
respect to previous lower resolution observations. Finally, the magnetic field
strength does not significantly differ from the values found in the literature
for radio sources with similar sizes. These results are not easily interpreted
with the youth scenario for BAL QSOs, in which they are generally compact
objects still expelling a dust cocoon. The variety of orientations,
morphologies, and extensions found are presumably related to different possible
angles for the BAL producing outflows, with respect to the jet axis. Moreover,
the phenomenon could be present in various phases of the QSO evolution.

  Duality in Convex Programming",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fourier-Motzkin elimination is a projection algorithm for solving finite
linear programs. We extend Fourier-Motzkin elimination to semi-infinite linear
programs which are linear programs with finitely many variables and infinitely
many constraints. Applying projection leads to new characterizations of
important properties for primal-dual pairs of semi-infinite programs such as
zero duality gap, feasibility, boundedness, and solvability. Extending the
Fourier-Motzkin elimination procedure to semi-infinite linear programs yields a
new classification of variables that is used to determine the existence of
duality gaps. In particular, the existence of what the authors term dirty
variables can lead to duality gaps. Our approach has interesting applications
in finite-dimensional convex optimization. For example, sufficient conditions
for a zero duality gap, such as existence of a Slater point, are reduced to
guaranteeing that there are no dirty variables. This leads to completely new
proofs of such sufficient conditions for zero duality.

cores, we revise the conventional stability condition of hydrostatic
Bonnor-Ebert spheres to take internal motions into account. Because observed
starless cores resemble Bonnor-Ebert density structures, the stability and
dynamics of the starless cores are frequently analyzed by comparing to the
conventional stability condition of a hydrostatic Bonnor-Ebert sphere. However,
starless cores are not hydrostatic but have observed internal motions. In this
study, we take gaseous spheres with a homologous internal velocity field and
derive stability conditions of the spheres utilizing a virial analysis. We
propose two limiting models of spontaneous gravitational collapse: the collapse
of critical Bonnor-Ebert spheres and uniform density spheres. The collapse of
these two limiting models are intended to provide the lower and the upper
limits, respectively, of the infall speeds for a given density structure. The
results of our study suggest that the stability condition sensitively depends
on internal motions. A homologous inward motion with a transonic speed can
reduce the critical size compared to the static Bonnor-Ebert sphere by more
than a factor of two. As an application of the two limiting models of
spontaneous gravitational collapse, we compare the density structures and
infall speeds of the observed starless cores L63, L1544, L1689B, and L694-2 to
the two limiting models. L1689B and L694-2 seem to have been perturbed to
result in faster infall motions than for spontaneous gravitational collapse.

observations of the Type IIn SNe 2005ip and 2006jd, the full CSP sample is used
to derive physical parameters that describe the nature of the interaction
between the expanding SN ejecta and the circumstellar material (CSM). For each
SN of our sample, we find counterparts, identifying objects similar to SNe
1994W (SN 2006bo), 1998S (SN 2008fq), and 1988Z (SN 2006qq). We present the
unprecedented initial $u$-band plateau of SN 2006aa, and its peculiar late-time
luminosity and temperature evolution. For each SN, mass-loss rates of
10$^{-4}-10^{-2}$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ are derived, assuming the CSM was
formed by steady winds. Typically wind velocities of a few hundred km s$^{-1}$
are also computed. The CSP SN IIn sample seems to be divided into subcategories
rather than to have exhibited a continuum of observational properties. The wind
and mass-loss parameters would favor a luminous blue variable progenitor
scenario. However the assumptions made to derive those parameters strongly
influence the results, and therefore, other progenitor channels behind SNe IIn
cannot be excluded at this time.

to investigate the system at temperatures from T=5 K to 150 K and pressures
from P=0 GPa to 30 GPa. When increasing the pressure at low temperature, we
find the two transitions from an orthorhombic to a tetragonal and to a
collapsed tetragonal structure that are also observed in zero temperature
structure relaxations and in experiment. However, these transitions are
considerably smeared out at finite temperature, whereas the critical pressure
for the first transition increases with temperature. We also analyze the
electronic structure of BaFe2As2 at finite temperature and work out differences
between the time averaged band structure and Fermi surface at finite
temperature compared to the known zero temperature results. Our results should
be helpful for resolving some open issues in experimental reports for BaFe2As2
under high pressure.

which yield the observed distribution of hadron multiplicities and, at the same

are very complicated and hence it is not easy to find exact analytical
solutions. However, if one considers traceless energy-momentum tensor for the
matter source as well as constant scalar curvature, one can derive some exact
analytical solutions from $f(R)$ theory coupled to a matter field. In this
paper, by assuming constant curvature scalar, we construct a class of charged
rotating black string solutions in $f(R)$-Maxwell theory. We study the physical
properties and obtain the conserved quantities of the solutions. The conserved
and thermodynamic quantities computed here depend on function $f'(R_{0})$ and
differ completely from those of Einstein theory in AdS spaces. Besides, unlike
Einstein gravity, the entropy does not obey the area law. We also investigate
the validity of the first law of thermodynamics as well as the stability
analysis in the canonical ensemble, and show that the black string solutions
are always thermodynamically stable in $f(R)$-Maxwell theory with constant
curvature scalar. Finally, we extend the study to the case where the Ricci
scalar is not a constant and in particular $R=R(r)$. In this case, by using the
Lagrangian multipliers method, we derive an analytical black string solution
from $f(R)$ gravity and reconstructed the function $R(r)$. We find that this
class of solutions has an additional logaritmic term in the metric function
which incorporates the effect of the $f(R)$ theory in the solutions.

Methods: We used Chandra archival observations to analyze the X-ray emission
from the supernova remnant. The surrounding gas was investigated using data
extracted from the Galactic Ring Survey, the VLA Galactic Plane Survey, the
Galactic Legacy Infrared Midplane Survey Extraordinaire, and the Bolocam
Galactic Plane Survey. Results: G20.0-0.2 shows diffuse X-ray emission from the
central region of the radio remnant. Although the current data do not allow us
to distinguish between a thermal or non-thermal origin for the X-ray diffuse
emission, based on the radio properties we suggest a synchrotron origin as the
most favorable. The hard X-ray point source CXO J182807.4-113516 appears
located at the geometrical center of the remnant and is a potential candidate
to be the pulsar powering the nebula. We found a molecular cloud adjacent to
the flattest border of G20.0-0.2, indicating a probable interaction between the
shock front of the remnant and the molecular gas. Several young stellar object
candidates are found located in the brightest region of the molecular emission,

statistical literature as an alternative to elliptical models. Whereas
k-dimensional elliptical densities depend on one single unspecified radial
density, however, k-dimensional independent component distributions involve k
unspecified component densities that for given sample size n and dimension k
making statistical analysis harder. We focus here on estimating the model's
mixing matrix. Traditional methods (FOBI, Kernel-ICA, FastICA) originating from
the engineering literature have consistency that requires moment conditions
without achieving any type of asymptotic efficiency. When based on robust
scatter matrices, the two-scatter methods developed by Oja, et al. (2006) and
Nordhausen, et al. (2008) enjoy better robustness features but have unclear
optimality properties. The semiparametric approach by Chen and Bickel (2006)
achieves semiparametric efficiency but requires estimating the k unobserved
independent component densities. As a reaction, an efficient
(signed-)rank-based approach has been proposed by Ilmonen and Paindaveine
(2011) for the case of symmetric component densities that fail to be root-n
consistent as soon as one of the component densities is asymmetric. In this
paper, using ranks rather than signed ranks, we extend their approach to the
asymmetric case and propose a one-step R-estimator for ICA mixing matrices. The
finite-sample performances of those estimators are investigated and compared to
those of existing methods under moderately large sample sizes. Particularly
good performances are obtained when using data-driven scores taking into

  models with moment constraints",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, there has been a growing interest in developing inventory control
policies which are robust to model misspecification. One approach is to posit
that nature selects a worst-case distribution for any stochastic primitives
from some pre-specified family. Several communities have observed that a subtle
phenomena known as time inconsistency can arise in this framework. In
particular, it becomes possible that a policy which is optimal at time zero may
not be optimal for the associated optimization problem in which the
decision-maker recomputes her policy at each point in time, which has
implications for implementability. If there exists a policy which is optimal
for both formulations, we say that the policy is time consistent, and the
problem is weakly time consistent. If every optimal policy is time consistent,
we say that the problem is strongly time consistent. We study these phenomena
in the context of managing an inventory over time, when only the mean,
variance, and support are known for the demand at each stage. We provide
several illustrative examples showing that here the question of time
consistency can be quite subtle, and complement these observations by providing
simple sufficient conditions for weak and strong time consistency.
Interestingly, our results show that time consistency may hold even when
rectangularity does not. Although a similar phenomena was previously identified
by Shapiro for the setting in which only the mean and support of the demand are
known, there the problem was always weakly time consistent, with both
formulations having the same optimal value. Here our model is rich enough to
exhibit a variety of interesting behaviors, including lack of weak time
consistency, strong time consistency even when both formulations have different
optimal values, and non-existence of even a single optimal base-stock policy
under the static formulation.

destroyed by interactions with other stars in the cluster, lowering the total
binary fraction and significantly altering the initial semi-major axis
distribution. However, the shape of the CMRD is unaffected by dynamics; an
equal number of systems with high mass ratios are destroyed compared to systems
with low mass ratios. We might expect a weak dependence of the survivability of
a binary on its mass ratio because its binding energy is proportional to both
the primary and secondary mass components of the system. However, binaries are
broken up by interactions in which the perturbing star has a significantly
higher energy (by a factor of >10, depending on the particular binary
properties) than the binding energy of the binary, or through multiple
interactions in the cluster. We therefore suggest that the shape of the
observed binary CMRD is an outcome of the star formation process, and should be
measured in preference to the distributions of orbital parameters, such as the
semi-major axis distribution.

survival models to study the occurrence of planetesimal discs around them.
These survival models describe a planetesimal disc with a small number of
parameters, determine if it may survive a series of dynamical processes and
compute the associated infrared excess. For the WISE satellite, we demonstrate
that the dearth of debris discs around M stars may be attributed to the small
semi-major axes generally probed if either: 1. the dust grains behave like
blackbodies emitting at a peak wavelength coincident with the observed one; 2.
or the grains are hotter than predicted by their blackbody temperatures and
emit at peak wavelengths that are shorter than the observed one. At these small
distances from the M star, planetesimals are unlikely to survive or persist for
time scales of 300 Myr or longer if the disc is too massive. Conversely, our
survival models allow for the existence of a large population of low-mass
debris discs that are too faint to be detected with current instruments.
However, our interpretation becomes less clear and large infrared excesses are
allowed if only one of these scenarios holds: 3. the dust grains are hotter
than blackbody and predominantly emit at the observed wavelength; 4. or are
blackbody in nature and emit at peak wavelengths longer than the observed one.
Both scenarios imply that the parent planetesimals reside at larger distances
from the star than inferred if the dust grains behaved like blackbodies. In all
scenarios, we show that the infrared excesses detected at 22 and 70 microns
from AU Mic are easily reconciled with its young age. We elucidate the
conditions under which stellar wind drag may be neglected when considering dust
populations around M stars. The WISE satellite should be capable of detecting
debris discs around young M stars with ages on the order of 10 Myr.

distribution, so lines of sight with the highest total luminosity in LRGs are
likely to contain the largest total mass. We apply this selection technique to
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and identify the 200 fields with the highest total
LRG luminosities projected within a 3.5' radius over the redshift range 0.1 < z

known galaxy cluster and 56.0% contain multiple known clusters previously
identified in the literature. Thus, our results confirm that these LRGs trace
massive structures and that our selection technique identifies fields with
large total masses. These fields contain 2-3 times higher total LRG
luminosities than most known strong-lensing clusters and will be among the best
gravitational lensing fields for the purpose of detecting the highest redshift

applying an H{\alpha} based star formation rate (SFR) calibration, we derive
the dust masses and temperatures, SFRs, gas masses and star formation
efficiencies (SFEs). The detected sources lie exclusively on the spiral arms
and represent giant molecular associations (GMAs), with gas masses and sizes of
10^6-10^8 solar masses and 200-300 pc, respectively. The inferred parameters
show little to no radial dependence and there is only a weak correlation
between the SFRs and gas masses, which suggests that more massive clouds are
less efficient at forming stars. Dust heating is mainly due to local star
formation. However, although the sources are not optically thick, the total
intrinsic young stellar population luminosity can almost completely account for
the dust luminosity. This suggests that other radiation sources contribute to
the dust heating as well and approximately compensate for the unabsorbed

generally follow a log-normal distribution, with the cases that have $\tau
\approx 1$ best matching the PDF of the column density. We fit a 2D
variance-sonic Mach number relationship to our logarithmic PDFs of the form
$\sigma_{ln(\Sigma/\Sigma_0)}^2=A\times ln(1+b^2{\cal M}_s^2)$ and find that,
for parameter $b=1/3$, parameter $A$ depends on the radiative transfer
environment. We also explore the variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the linear
PDFs finding that higher moments reflect both higher sonic Mach number and
lower optical depth. Finally, we apply the Tsallis incremental PDF function and
find that the fit parameters depend on both Mach numbers, but also are
sensitive to the radiative transfer parameter space, with the $\tau \approx 1$
case best fitting the incremental PDF of the true column density. We conclude
that, for PDFs of low optical depth cases, part of the gas is always
sub-thermally excited so that the spread of the line intensities exceeds the
spread of the underlying column densities and hence the PDFs do not reflect the
true column density. Similarly, PDFs of optically thick cases are dominated by
the velocity dispersion and therefore do not represent the true column density
PDF. Thus, in the case of molecules like carbon monoxide, the dynamic range of
intensities, structures observed and consequently, the observable PDFs, are
less determined by turbulence and more-often determined by radiative transfer
effects.

diffusion is based on the model of 3D reconnection of weakly turbulent magnetic

rate of reconnection diffusion does not depend on the level of ionization and
therefore the usually employed ambipolar diffusion idea gets irrelevant for
magnetic field transport in turbulent fluids. We claim that the reconnection
diffusion process is a manifestation of the violation of flux conservation in
highly conducting turbulent fluids. We discuss the consequences of reconnection
diffusion for star formation and stress. We show that reconnection diffusion on
large scales is independent of small scale magnetic field dynamics of magnetic

  We give a simple polynomial-time algorithm for finding a subset with vertex
expansion $O(\sqrt{OPT \log d})$ where $d$ is the maximum degree of the graph.
Our main result is an asymptotically matching lower bound: under the Small Set
Expansion (SSE) hypothesis, it is hard to find a subset with expansion less
than $C\sqrt{OPT \log d}$ for an absolute constant $C$. In particular, this
implies for all constant $\epsilon > 0$, it is SSE-hard to distinguish whether
the vertex expansion $< \epsilon$ or at least an absolute constant. The
analogous threshold for edge expansion is $\sqrt{OPT}$ with no dependence on
the degree; thus our results suggest that vertex expansion is harder to
approximate than edge expansion. In particular, while Cheeger's algorithm can
certify constant edge expansion, it is SSE-hard to certify constant vertex
expansion in graphs.
  Our proof is via a reduction from the {\it Unique Games} instance obtained
from the \SSE hypothesis to the vertex expansion problem. It involves the
definition of a smoother intermediate problem we call {\sf Analytic Vertex
Expansion} which is representative of both the vertex expansion and the
conductance of the graph. Both reductions (from the UGC instance to this

also useful for other new physics searches with di-leptonic top and anti-top

accurate solar cycle predictions (with aims at predicting the long-term
evolution of space weather), leading to nearly a hundred widely spread
predictions for the amplitude of solar cycle 24. A major contributor to the
disagreement is the lack of direct long-term databases covering different
components of the solar magnetic field (toroidal vs.\ poloidal). Here we use
sunspot area and polar faculae measurements spanning a full century (as our
toroidal and poloidal field proxies), to study solar cycle propagation, memory,

magnetic fields, whereas we find sunspot area to be uncorrelated to cycle
amplitude unless multiplied by area-weighted average tilt. This suggests that
the joint assimilation of tilt and sunspot area is a better choice (with aims
to cycle prediction) than sunspot area alone, and adds to the evidence in favor
of active region emergence and decay as the main mechanism of poloidal field
generation (i.e. the Babcock-Leighton mechanism). Finally, by looking at the
correlation between our poloidal and toroidal proxies across multiple cycles,
we find solar cycle memory to be limited to only one cycle.

experience coherent eccentricity oscillations as well as excursions to very
high eccentricity that occur over a much larger fraction of the parameter space

that the frequency of evolutionary paths influenced by KL cycles is comparable
in the triple and quadruple populations even though field quadruples are a
factor of ~5 less frequent than triples. Additionally, quadruples might be a
non-negligible source of triples and provide fundamentally new evolutionary
outcomes involving close binaries, mergers, collisions, and associated

Superluminal signal velocity and zero time tunneling was first observed in an
analog tunneling experiment with microwaves. Recently, the conjectured zero
time of electron was claimed to be observed in ionizing helium. The FTL signal
velocity was reproduced with infrared light and with various tunneling barriers
in several laboratories worldwide. Remarkable, it was shown that the tunneling
time is a universal quantity for elastic and for electromagnetic fields. Many
theoretical physicists predicted this FTL nature of the tunneling process.
However, even with this background many members of the physics community did
not accept the superluminal signal velocity interpretation of the experimental
results and they also ignored the universal tunneling time. The predicted and
measured zero tunneling time was taken as a fantastic nonsense. A brief
explanation of the misleading theoretical approaches against FTL signals due to

construct an appropriate first and second order approximation on a grid which
supersets the grid that we used for the diffusion part. These approximations
make the scheme to be unconditionally stable in time and preserve positivity of
the solution which is computed either via a matrix exponential, or via P{\'a}de

Y-chromosome haplotypes, on which the Myers protocol for relative
identification was carried out. For Y-chromosome sharing first degree
relatives, the Myers protocol has a high probability (80 - 99%) of identifying
their relationship. For unrelated individuals, there is a low probability that
an unrelated person in the database will be identified as a first-degree
relative. For more distant Y-haplotype sharing relatives (half-siblings, first
cousins, half-first cousins or second cousins) there is a substantial
probability that the more distant relative will be incorrectly identified as a
first-degree relative. For example, there is a 3 - 18% probability that a first
cousin will be identified as a full sibling, with the probability depending on
the population background. Although the California familial search policy is
likely to identify a first degree relative if his profile is in the database,
and it poses little risk of falsely identifying an unrelated individual in a
database as a first-degree relative, there is a substantial risk of falsely
identifying a more distant Y-haplotype sharing relative in the database as a

become the target for further investigation. This risk falls disproportionately

tachocline consistent with the Gough and McIntyre (1998) model. We find
nonlinear, axisymmetric, steady-state numerical solutions in which: (1) a
large-scale primordial field is confined within the radiation zone by
downwelling meridional flows that are gyroscopically pumped in the convection
zone (2) the radiation zone is in almost-uniform rotation, with a rotation rate
consistent with observations (3) the bulk of the tachocline is magnetic free,
in thermal-wind balance and in thermal equilibrium and (4) the interaction
between the field and the flows takes place within a very thin magnetic
boundary layer, the tachopause, located at the bottom of the tachocline. We
show that the thickness of the tachocline scales with the amplitude of the
meridional flows exactly as predicted by Gough and McIntyre. We also determine
the parameter conditions under which such solutions can be obtained, and
provide a simple explanation for the failure of previous numerical attempts at
reproducing the Gough and McIntyre model. Finally, we discuss the implications
of our findings for future numerical models of the solar interior, and for
future observations of the Sun and other stars.

gaseous filaments, observed in radio, infrared, optical and X-ray bands. We
propose that these filaments are powered by the reconnection of the magnetic
field in the wakes of buoyant bubbles. AGN-inflated bubbles of relativistic
plasma rise buoyantly in the cluster atmosphere, stretching and amplifying the
field in the wake to values of $\displaystyle \beta =8\pi P_{gas}/B^2\sim 1$.
The field lines in the wake have opposite directions and are forced together as
the bubble motion stretches the filament. This setup bears strong similarity to
the coronal loops on the Sun or to the Earth's magneto-tail. The reconnection
process naturally explains both the required level of local dissipation rate in
filaments and the overall luminosity of filaments. The original source of power
for the filaments is the potential energy of buoyant bubbles, inflated by the
central AGN.

a large collection of roughly two hundred generic black hole binary merger
simulations both in the simulation frame and in a corotating frame that tracks
precession. To a first approximation, the corotating-frame waveforms resemble
nonprecessing analogs, based on similarity over a band-limited frequency
interval defined using a fiducial detector (here, advanced LIGO) and the
source's total mass $M$. By restricting attention to masses $M\in 100, 1000
M_\odot$, we insure our comparisons are sensitive only to our simulated
late-time inspiral, merger, and ringdown signals. In this mass region, every
one of our precessing simulations can be fit by some physically similar member
of the \texttt{IMRPhenomB} phenomenological waveform family to better than 95%;
most fit significantly better. The best-fit parameters at low and high mass
correspond to natural physical limits: the pre-merger orbit and post-merger
perturbed black hole. Our results suggest that physically-motivated synthetic
signals can be derived by viewing radiation from suitable nonprecessing
binaries in a suitable nonintertial reference frame. While a good first
approximation, precessing systems have degrees of freedom (i.e., the transverse
spins) which a nonprecessing simulation cannot reproduce. We quantify the
extent to which these missing degrees of freedom limit the utility of synthetic
precessing signals for detection and parameter estimation.

strategies for the downlink of cloud radio access networks. In these systems, a
central encoder is connected to multiple multi-antenna base stations (BSs) via
finite-capacity backhaul links. At the central encoder, precoding is followed
by compression in order to produce the rate-limited bit streams delivered to
each BS over the corresponding backhaul link. In current state-of-the-art
approaches, the signals intended for different BSs are compressed
independently. In contrast, this work proposes to leverage joint compression,
also referred to as multivariate compression, of the signals of different BSs
in order to better control the effect of the additive quantization noises at
the mobile stations (MSs). The problem of maximizing the weighted sum-rate with
respect to both the precoding matrix and the joint correlation matrix of the
quantization noises is formulated subject to power and backhaul capacity
constraints. An iterative algorithm is proposed that achieves a stationary
point of the problem. Moreover, in order to enable the practical implementation
of multivariate compression across BSs, a novel architecture is proposed based
on successive steps of minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimation and per-BS
compression. Robust design with respect to imperfect channel state information
is also discussed. From numerical results, it is confirmed that the proposed
joint precoding and compression strategy outperforms conventional approaches
based on the separate design of precoding and compression or independent
compression across the BSs.

circumnuclear starforming regions (CNSFRs) in 3 nearby early spiral galaxies,
NGC2903, NGC3310 and NGC3351. We find that single Gaussian fitting to the
H$\beta$ and [OIII]5007A line profiles results in velocity dispersions around
32km/s and 52km/s, respectively, while the IR CaII triplet cross-correlation
technique provides stellar velocity dispersion values close to 50km/s. Even
though multiple kinematical components are present, the relation between gas
velocity dispersion and Balmer emission line luminosity (L-sigma relation)
reproduces the correlation for disk giant HII regions albeit with a larger
scatter. The scatter in the L-sigma relation is considerably reduced when
theoretical evolutionary corrections are applied suggesting that an age range
is present in the sample of CNSFRs. To analyse the observed complex profiles,
we performed multiple Gaussian component fits to the Hbeta and [OIII]?5007A
lines obtaining optimal fits with two Gaussians of different width. These best
fits indicate that the narrower component has average velocity dispersion close
to 23km/s while the broader component shows average values in the range
50-60km/s for both lines, close to the observed stellar velocity dispersions.
The fluxes of the broad and narrow Hbeta components are similar. This is not
the case for [OIII]5007A for which the broad components have higher fluxes than
the narrow ones, thus producing a clear segregation in their [OIII]/Hbeta
ratios. We suggest a possible scenario for understanding the behaviour of
CNSFRs in the L-sigma and sigma_gas-sigma_star diagrams involving an inner
gaseous disk responsible for the narrow component of the emission lines.

of $[n]$ with $n-1$ blocks avoiding a permutation pattern of length 3. They
showed that $|\mathcal{OP}_{n,k}(\sigma)|=|\mathcal{OP}_{n,k}(123)|$ for any

quantities are singular or self-similar at different (spatial) scales. Such
properties of systems are currently characterized by some order parameters and
a few critical exponents. Nevertheless, recent studies show that the
multifractality, where a large number of exponents are needed to quantify
systems, appears in many complex systems displaying self-similarity. Here we
propose a general approach and show that the appearance of the multifractality
of an order parameter related quantity is the signature of a physical system
transiting from one phase to another. The distribution of this quantity
obtained within suitable (time) scales satisfies a $q$-Gaussian distribution
plus a possible Cauchy distributed background. At the critical point the
$q$-Gaussian shifts between Gaussian type with narrow tails and
L$\acute{\text{e}}$vy type with fat tails. Our results suggest that the Tsallis
$q$-statistics, besides the conventional Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics, may play
an important role during phase transitions.

modules: Local Reference Frame (LRF) definition, RoPS feature description and
3D object recognition. We propose a novel technique to define the LRF by
calculating the scatter matrix of all points lying on the local surface. RoPS
feature descriptors are obtained by rotationally projecting the neighboring
points of a feature point onto 2D planes and calculating a set of statistics
(including low-order central moments and entropy) of the distribution of these
projected points. Using the proposed LRF and RoPS descriptor, we present a
hierarchical 3D object recognition algorithm. The performance of the proposed
LRF, RoPS descriptor and object recognition algorithm was rigorously tested on
a number of popular and publicly available datasets. Our proposed techniques
exhibited superior performance compared to existing techniques. We also showed
that our method is robust with respect to noise and varying mesh resolution.

unit circle belongs to the Weil-Petersson class, namely, $h$ can be extended to
a quasiconformal mapping to the unit disk whose Beltrami coefficient is
squarely integrable in the Poincar\'e metric if and only if $h$ is absolutely
continuous such that $\log h'$ belongs to the Sobolev class $H^{\frac 12}$.
This solves an open problem posed by Takhtajan-Teo [TT2] in 2006 and
investigated later by Figalli [Fi], Gay-Balmaz-Marsden-Ratiu ([GMR], [GR]) and
others.

the following applications which are also explored in this paper:
  \noindent (2) It is proved that there exists a quasisymmetric homeomorphism
of the Weil-Petersson class which belongs neither to the Sobolev class

very recently by Gay-Balmaz-Ratiu [GR] when studying the classical

novel quasi-cycloidal structures induced by external magnetic field or by

of homogeneous magnetic states and incommensurate structures stability are
constructed for the two essential geometries of magnetic field (magnetic field
oriented parallel to the principal crystal axis C_3 and perpendicular to this
direction C_3). It is shown that the direction of applied magnetic field
substantially affects a set of magnetic phases, properties of incommensurate
structures, character of phase transitions. Novel conical type of cycloidal
ordering is revealed during the transition from incommensurate cycloidal
structure into homogeneous magnetic state. Elaborated phase diagrams allow
estimate appropriate combination of control parameters (magnetic field,
magnetic anisotropy, exchange stiffness) required to the destruction of
cycloidal ordering corresponding to the transition into homogeneous structure.
The results show that the magnitude of critical magnetic field suppressing

problems (CSP), for which very efficient algorithms are known. Most of these
involve the combination of two techniques: some direct propagation of

values) and some kind of structured search (depth-first, breadth-first,...).
But when such blind search is not possible or not allowed or when one wants a
'constructive' or a 'pattern-based' solution, one must devise more complex
propagation rules instead. In this case, one can introduce the notion of a
candidate (a 'still possible' value for a variable). Here, we give this
intuitive notion a well defined logical status, from which we can define the
concepts of a resolution rule and a resolution theory. In order to keep our

explains the ""clover-leaf""-shaped angular anisotropy which was previously
observed for several nanostructured magnetic materials, and it provides access

galaxies that are found in the high-redshift universe. The detection of LBGs in
the FIR domain can provide very important clues on their dust attenuation and
total SFR, allowing a more detailed study than those performed so far. In this
work we explore the FIR emission of a sample of 16 LBGs at z ~ 3 in the
GOODS-North and GOODS-South fields that are individually detected in PACS-100um

dust emission of LBGs at high redshift. We find that PACS-detected LBGs at z ~
3 are highly obscured galaxies which belong to the Ultra luminous IR galaxies

the dust attenuation factors obtained from their UV continuum slope or their
SED-derived dust attenuation employing Bruzual & Charlot (2003) templates. Both
methods underestimate the results for most of the galaxies. Comparing with a
sample of PACS-detected LBGs at z ~ 1 we find evidences that the FIR emission
of LBGs might have changed with redshift in the sense that the dustiest LBGs
found at z ~ 3 have more prominent FIR emission, are dustier for a given UV
slope, and have higher SFR for a given stellar mass than the dustiest LBGs

nature. The real difficulty in understanding detailed microscopic aspects of
such transitions in molecular systems arises from the interplay between
different energy and length scales involved in molecular systems, often
mediated through a solvent. In this work we employ Monte Carlo (MC) simulations
to study the collapse transition in a model molecular system interacting via
both isotropic as well as anisotropic interactions having different length and
energy scales. The model we use is known as Mercedes-Benz (MB) which for a
specific set of parameters sustains three solid phases: honeycomb, oblique and
triangular. In order to study the temperature induced collapse transition, we
start with a metastable honeycomb solid and induce transition by heating. High
density oblique solid so formed has two characteristic length scales
corresponding to isotropic and anisotropic parts of interaction potential.
Contrary to the common believe and classical nucleation theory, interestingly,
we find linear strip-like nucleating clusters having significantly different
order and average coordination number than the bulk stable phase. In the early
stage of growth, the cluster grows as linear strip followed by branched and
ring-like strips. The geometry of growing cluster is a consequence of the
delicate balance between two types of interactions which enables the dominance
of stabilizing energy over the destabilizing surface energy. The nuclei of
stable oblique phase are wetted by intermediate order particles which minimizes
the surface free energy. We observe different pathways for pressure and
temperature induced transitions.

large number of theoretical proposals. Here we report a spin-orbit coupling in
three carbon nanotube devices that is an order of magnitude larger than

corresponding to a built-in effective magnetic field of 29 T aligned along the

transition from quiescent to flare state occurs in 1--2 ks. We have observed
that the quiescent state spectrum is unprecedentedly steep with a photon index
Gamma~7.1, and the spectrum of the flare state is flatter with Gamma~4.4.
X-rays above 2 keV were not significantly detected in either state. In the
quiescent state, the spectrum appears to be dominated by a black body component
of temperature about ~30--40 eV, which is comparable to the expected maximum
effective temperature from the inner accretion disk. The quiescent state
however, requires an additional steep power-law, presumably arising from the
Comptonization by transient heated electrons. Optical spectrum from the Sloan

data reveal that NGC 6058 is a multipolar planetary nebula of about ~45 arcsec
in extent and formed by four bipolar outflows that are oriented at different
position angles. Assuming homologous expansion for all the structures, and a
distance of 3.5 kpc, we obtain polar velocities around ~68 km s^-1 for three of
them. The estimated kinematical ages suggest that the three oldest outflows
have been ejected in intervals of ~ 1100 and ~ 400 yr during which, the
ejection axis has changes its orientation by ~ 60 degrees and ~ 40 degrees,
respectively. Although a inner ring-like structure is suggested by the direct
images, its kinematics shows that no equatorial ring or toroid exists in the
nebula. At the contrary, the long-slit spectra reveal that the ring-like
structure corresponds to a fourth outflow that is oriented almost perpendicular
to the other three. This fourth outflow is the youngest one and appears to be
interacting with the other three, creating a protruding zone that sweeps
material in a region almost perpendicular to the major axes of the oldest
outflows. This structure also presents two bright arcuate regions along the
same direction of the older outflows, and at opposite sides from the central
star. From our model, we suggest that NGC 6058 could be anintermediate
evolutionary stage between starfish planetary nebulae and multipolar planetary
nebula with apparent equatorial lobes.

Model of international trade. The model predicts that the intensity of trade
between two countries is described by a formula similar to Newton's law of
gravitation, where mass is replaced by Gross Domestic Product. Since
Tinbergen's proposal, the Gravity Model has become the standard model of
non-zero trade flows in macroeconomics. However, its intrinsic limitation is
the prediction of a completely connected network, which fails to explain the
observed intricate topology of international trade. Recent network models
overcome this limitation by describing the real network as a member of a
maximum-entropy statistical ensemble. The resulting expressions are formally
analogous to quantum statistics: the international trade network is found to
closely follow the Fermi-Dirac statistics in its purely binary topology, and
the recently proposed mixed Bose-Fermi statistics in its full (binary plus
weighted) structure. This seemingly esoteric result is actually a simple effect
of the heterogeneity of world countries, that imposes strong structural
constraints on the network. Our discussion highlights similarities and
differences between macroeconomics and statistical-physics approaches to
economic networks.

to study the performance of a mechanism combining an AQM with a time-space

propose a mathematical model using Poisson and MMPP processes to model the

analytically. The two-point function is characterised by different power on
large and small scales, and a burst of small amplitude superimposed
oscillations in between. Motivated by string-theory models with stuck branes,
we extend this analysis to Dirac Born Infeld (DBI) inflation, for which
generalised slow-roll is violated at the discontinuity and a rapid variation in
the speed of sound c_s occurs. In an attempt to characterise the effect of
non-linear kinetic terms on the oscillatory features of the primordial

values on large and small scales, while on intermediate scales it is
characterised by much larger amplitude and higher frequency superimposed
oscillations. We also show that calculating non-Gaussianities in this model is
a complicated but interesting task since all terms in the cubic action now
contribute. Investigating whether the superimposed oscillations could fit to

The Brazilian Tunable Filter Imager (BTFI) is a versatile, new technology,
tunable optical imager to be used in seeing-limited mode and at higher spatial
fidelity using the SAM Ground-Layer Adaptive Optics facility at the SOAR
telescope. The instrument opens important new science capabilities for the SOAR
community, from studies of the centers of nearby galaxies and the insterstellar
medium to statistical cosmological investigations. The BTFI takes advantage of
three new technologies. The imaging Bragg Tunable Filter concept utilizes
Volume Phase Holographic Gratings in a double-pass configuration, as a tunable
filter, while a new Fabry-Perot (FP) concept involves technologies which allow
a single FP etalon to act over a large range of interference orders and
spectral resolutions. Both technologies will be in the same instrument.
Spectral resolutions spanning the range between 25 and 30,000 can be achieved
through the use of iBTF at low resolution and scanning FPs beyond R ~2,000. The
third new technologies in BTFI is the use of EMCCDs for rapid and cyclically
wavelength scanning thus mitigating the damaging effect of atmospheric
variability through data acquisition. An additional important feature of the
instrument is that it has two optical channels which allow for the simultaneous
recording of the narrow-band, filtered image with the remaining (complementary)
broad-band light. This avoids the uncertainties inherent in tunable filter
imaging using a single detector. The system was designed to supply tunable
filter imaging with a field-of-view of 3 arcmin on a side, sampled at 0.12"" for
direct Nasmyth seeing-limited area spectroscopy and for SAM's visitor
instrument port for GLAO-fed area spectroscopy. The instrument has seen first

analysis is a real challenge, which is interestingly implied to their lexical
and syntactic organization levels. Statements dealing with sign language occupy
a significant interest in the Automatic Natural Language Processing (ANLP)
domain. In this work, we are dealing with sign language recognition, in
particular of French Sign Language (FSL). FSL has its own specificities, such
as the simultaneity of several parameters, the important role of the facial
expression or movement and the use of space for the proper utterance
organization. Unlike speech recognition, Frensh sign language (FSL) events
occur both sequentially and simultaneously. Thus, the computational processing
of FSL is too complex than the spoken languages. We present a novel approach
based on HMM to reduce the recognition complexity.

analyzing the spatiotemporal dynamics of complex cardiac arrhythmias. However,
the relationship between the spectrum of cardiac signals and the spatiotemporal

paper, we derive a mathematical expression relating the spectrum of cardiac
signals to the spatiotemporal dynamics of cardiac sources and the measurement
characteristics of the lead systems. Then, by using analytical methods and
computer simulations we analyze the spectrum of cardiac signals measured by
idealized lead systems during correlated and uncorrelated spatiotemporal
dynamics. Our results show that lead systems can have distorting effects on the
spectral envelope of cardiac signals, which depend on the spatial resolution of
the lead systems and on the degree of spatiotemporal correlation of the
underlying cardiac sources. In addition to this, our results indicate that the
spectral features that do not depend on the spectral envelope, such as the
dominant frequency, behave robustly against different choices of lead systems.

decay in two-temperature accretion flows around supermassive black holes. We
refine previous studies of such a hadronic gamma-ray emission by taking into
account (1) relativistic effects in the photon transfer and (2) absorption of
gamma-ray photons in the radiation field of the flow. We use a fully general
relativistic description of both the radiative and hydrodynamic processes,
which allows us to study the dependence on the black hole spin. The spin value
strongly affects the gamma-ray emissivity within ~10 gravitational radii. The
central regions of flows with the total luminosities L < 0.001 of the Eddington
luminosity are mostly transparent to photons with energies below 10 GeV,
permitting investigation of the effects of space-time metric. For such L, an
observational upper limit on the gamma-ray (0.1-10 GeV) to X-ray (2-10 keV)
luminosity ratio of L_{0.1-10 GeV}/L_{2-10 keV} << 0.1 can rule out rapid
rotation of the black hole; on the other hand, a measurement of L_{0.1-10
GeV}/L_{2-10 keV} ~ 0.1 cannot be regarded as the evidence of rapid rotation,
as such a ratio can also result from a flat radial profile of gamma-ray
emissivity (which would occur for nonthermal acceleration of protons in the
whole body of the flow). At L > 0.01 of the Eddington luminosity, the gamma-ray
emission from the innermost region is strongly absorbed and the observed
gamma-rays do not carry information on the value of the black hole spin. We
note that if the X-ray emission observed in Centaurus A comes from an accretion
flow, the hadronic gamma-ray emission from the flow should contribute
significantly to the MeV/GeV emission observed from the core of this object,
unless it contains a slowly rotating black hole and protons in the flow are

wide range of dielectrics have been studied including binary transition metal
oxides, perovskite oxides, chalcogenides, carbon- and silicon-based materials,
as well as organic materials. RS phenomena can be used to store information and
offer an attractive performance, which encompasses fast switching speeds, high
scalability, and the desirable compatibility with Si-based
complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor fabrication. This is promising for
nonvolatile memory technology, i.e. resistance random access memory (RRAM).
However, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanism is still
lacking. This impedes a faster product development as well as an accurate
assessment of the device performance potential. Generally speaking, RS occurs
not in the entire dielectric but only a small, confined region, which results
from the local variation of conductivity in dielectrics. In this review, we
focus on the RS in oxides with such an inhomogeneous conductivity. According to
the origin of the conductivity inhomogeneity, the RS phenomena and their
working mechanism are reviewed by dividing them into two aspects: interface RS,
based on the change of contact resistance at metal/oxide interface due to the
change of Schottky barrier and interface chemical layer, and bulk RS, realized
by the formation, connection, and disconnection of conductive channels in the
oxides. Finally the current challenges of RS investigation and the potential
improvement of the RS performance for the nonvolatile memories are discussed.

related to the electron emission at different centers in the molecule.
Employing the strong-field approximation and saddle-point methods, we find
that, in general, for non-vanishing ellipticity, there will be a blurring of
the temporal and spatial interference patterns. The former blurring is caused
by the electron velocity component perpendicular to the major polarization
axis, while spatial interference is washed out as a consequence either of s-p

properties of the acceptor hole states associated with single Mn acceptors

microscopy images of the acceptor local density of states (LDOS) show that the
strongly anisotropic hole wavefunction is not significantly affected by a
magnetic field up to 6 T. These experimental results are supported by
theoretical calculations based on a tightbinding model of Mn acceptors in GaAs.
For Mn acceptors on the (110) surface and the subsurfaces immediately
underneath, we find that an applied magnetic field modifies significantly the
magnetic anisotropy landscape. However the acceptor hole wavefunction is
strongly localized around the Mn and the LDOS is quite independent of the
direction of the Mn magnetic moment. On the other hand, for Mn acceptors placed
on deeper layers below the surface, the acceptor hole wavefunction is more
delocalized and the corresponding LDOS is much more sensitive on the direction
of the Mn magnetic moment. However the magnetic anisotropy energy for these
magnetic impurities is large (up to 15 meV), and a magnetic field of 10 T can
hardly change the landscape and rotate the direction of the Mn magnetic moment
away from its easy axis. We predict that substantially larger magnetic fields
are required to observe a significant field-dependence of the tunneling current
for impurities located several layers below the GaAs surface.

refrigerator. We investigate the attenuation behaviour (10 MHz- 20 GHz) of
filter made of four metal powders with a grain size below 50 um. The
room-temperature attenuation of a stainless steel powder filter is more than 80
dB at frequencies above 1.5 GHz. In all metal powder filters the attenuation
increases with temperature. Compared to classical powder filters, the design
presented here is much less laborious to fabricate and specifically the copper
powder PCB-filters deliver an equal or even better performance than their
classical counterparts.

boundary and inner-value problems. The framework enables the solution of the
ODEs for arbitrary nodes. There are four key issues involved in the formulation
of the framework: the use of a Lanczos process with complete
reorthogonalization for the synthesis of discrete orthonormal polynomials (DOP)
orthogonal over arbitrary nodes within the unit circle on the complex plane; a
consistent definition of a local differentiating matrix which implements a
uniform degree of approximation over the complete support --- this is
particularly important for initial and boundary value problems; a method of
computing a set of constraints as a constraining matrix and a method to
generate orthonormal admissible functions from the constraints and a DOP
matrix; the formulation of the solution to the ODEs as a least squares problem.
The computation of the solution is a direct matrix method. The worst case
maximum number of computations required to obtain the solution is known
a-priori. This makes the method, by definition, suitable for real-time
applications.
  The functionality of the framework is demonstrated using a selection of
initial value problems, Sturm-Liouville problems and a classical Engineering
boundary value problem. The framework is, however, generally formulated and is
applicable to countless differential equation problems.

rotating pawl whose surfaces break the rotation-inversion symmetry through
alternated patches of different inelasticity, immersed in a gas of granular
particles. The main novelty of our experimental setup is in the orientation of
the main axis, which is parallel to the (vertical) direction of shaking of the
granular fluid, guaranteeing an isotropic distribution for the velocities of
colliding grains, characterized by a variance $v_0^2$. We also keep the
granular system diluted, in order to compare with Boltzmann-equation-based
kinetic theory. In agreement with theory, we observe for the first time the
crucial role of Coulomb friction which induces two main regimes: (i) rare
collisions (RC), with an average drift $\ < \omega \ > \sim v_0^3$, and (ii)
frequent collisions (FC), with $\ < \omega \ > \sim v_0$. We also study the
fluctuations of the angle spanned in a large time interval, $\Delta \theta$,
which in the FC regime is proportional to the work done upon the motor. We
observe that the Fluctuation Relation is satisfied with a slope which weakly
depends on the relative collision frequency.

that at least some SL-SNe Ic are not completely helium free. At first sight,
the tail luminosity decline rates that we measure are consistent with the
radioactive decay of \co, and would require 1-4M of \ni to produce the
luminosity. These \ni masses cannot be made consistent with the short diffusion
times at peak, and indeed are insufficient to power the peak luminosity. We
instead favour energy deposition by newborn magnetars as the power source for
these objects. A semi-analytical diffusion model with energy input from the
spin-down of a magnetar reproduces the extensive lightcurve data well. The
model predictions of ejecta velocities and temperatures which are required are
in reasonable agreement with those determined from our observations. We derive

heating in the presence of a background zonal current on the polar beta-plane
are presented. The flow induced by a heater without the background zonal flow
is in the form of a beta-plume. Zonal jets of alternating directions are formed
within the plume. The westward transport velocity in the plume is proportional
to the upwelling velocity above the heater in agreement with linear theory.
When the background flow in the form of the eastward zonal current is present,
the beta-plume can be overwhelmed by the eastward current. The main control
parameters of the experiment are the strength of the heater and strength of the
sink which is used to create the background flow. The regime diagram shows the
area where a beta-plume can exist in the parameter space. The critical value of
the velocity of the zonal flow below which the beta-plume can exist is obtained

Mappings between neighboring v-space trees implemented for the advection

multi-point projection method, and the variance reduction method. We have
developed an efficient algorithm for calculating the linear Boltzmann collision

evolves as (1+z)^{5.1+/-1.9}. These results assume a single star forming galaxy
template; the presence of AGN, and an evolution in their relative contribution
to the mid-IR galaxy emission, will alter the overall number counts per cluster
and their rate of evolution. We infer the total SFR per unit cluster mass and
find T_SFR/M_c ~ (1+z)^{5.4+/-1.9}. This evolution can be attributed entirely
to the change in the in-falling field galaxy population. The T_SFR/M_c (binned
over all redshift) decreases with increasing cluster mass with a slope
(T_SFR/M_c ~ M_c^{-1.5+/-0.4}) consistent with the dependence of the
stellar-to-total mass per unit cluster mass seen locally. The inferred star
formation seen here could produce ~5-10% of the total stellar mass in massive
clusters at z = 0. Finally, we show a clear decrease in the number of IR-bright
galaxies per unit optical galaxy in the cluster cores, confirming star
formation continues to avoid the highest density regions of the universe at z ~
0.75 (the average redshift of the high-redshift clusters). While several
previous studies appear to show enhanced star formation in high-redshift
clusters relative to the field we note that these papers have not accounted for
the overall increase in galaxy or dark matter density at the location of
clusters. Once this is done, clusters at z ~ 0.75 have the same or less star

the most massive stars. A large amount of core angular momentum in the phases
preceding the explosion is required to form LGRBs. A very high initial
rotational velocity can provide this angular momentum. Such a velocity strongly
influences the way the star evolves: it is chemically homogeneously mixed and
evolves directly towards the blue part of the HR diagram from the main
sequence. We have shown that chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) takes place
in the SMC, at low metallicity. We want to see if there is a metallicity
threshold above which such an evolution does not exist. We perform a
spectroscopic analysis of H-rich early-type WN stars in the LMC and the Galaxy.
We use the code CMFGEN to determine the fundamental properties and the surface
composition of the target stars. We then place the stars in the HR diagram and
determine their evolution. We show that both the LMC and Galactic WNh stars we
selected cannot be explained by standard stellar evolution. They are located on
the left of the main sequence but show surface abundances typical of CN
equilibrium. In addition, they still contain a large amount of hydrogen. They
are thus core-H burning objects. Their properties are consistent with CHE. We
determine the metallicity of the Galactic stars from their position and
Galactic metallicity gradients, and conclude that they have 0.6<Z<1.0. A
moderate coupling between the core and the envelope is required to explain that
stellar winds do not extract to much angular momentum to prevent a blueward
evolution. In view of the findings that some long gamma ray bursts appear in
solar environments, CHE may be a viable way to form them over a wide range of
metallicities.

considering additional Gaussian operations on the state under examination. We
then apply these criteria to various non-Gaussian states evolving in a noisy

classification method which probabilistically assigns the uncertain points to
each of the classes. The proposed method is applied to the Breast Cancer
Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset which consists of 569 instances in 2 classes of
Malignant and Benign. This method assigns certain instances to their
appropriate classes with probability of one, and the uncertain instances to
each of the classes with associated probabilities. Therefore, based on the
degree of uncertainty, doctors can suggest further examinations before making
the final diagnosis.

linear model approach is too rigid due to a high outcome of zero counts and a
nonlinear influence of continuous covariates. Zero-Inflation is applied to take
into account the presence of excess zeros with separate link functions for the
zero and the nonzero component. Nonlinearity in covariates is captured by
spline functions based on B-splines. Our algorithm relies on maximum-likelihood
estimation and allows for adaptive box-constrained knots, thus improving the
goodness of the spline fit and allowing for detection of sensitivity
changepoints. A simulation study substantiates the numerical stability of the
algorithm to infer such models. The AIC criterion is shown to serve well for
model selection, in particular if nonlinearities are weak such that BIC tends
to overly simplistic models. We fit the introduced models to real data of
children's dental sanity, linking caries counts with the so-called
Body-Mass-Index (BMI) and other socioeconomic factors. This reveals a puzzling
nonmonotonic influence of BMI on caries counts which is yet to be explained by
clinical experts.

properties of topological groupoids is well known. One of the main results of
Skandalis, Tu and Yu is that a space admits a coarse embedding into Hilbert
space if and only if a certain associated topological groupoid is a-T-menable.
This groupoid characterisation then reduces the proof that the coarse
Baum-Connes conjecture holds for a coarsely embeddable space to known results
for a-T-menable groupoids. The property of admitting a fibred coarse embedding
into Hilbert space was introduced by Chen, Wang and Yu to provide a property
that is sufficient for the maximal analogue to the coarse Baum-Connes
conjecture and in this paper we connect this property to the traditional coarse
Baum-Connes conjecture using a restriction of the coarse groupoid and
homological algebra. Additionally we use this results to give a
characterisation of the a-T-menability for residually finite discrete groups.

is essential for orientation in birds migration. The most promising explanation
for this orientation is the photo-stimulated radical pair (RP) mechanism. In
order to define a reference frame for the orientation task radicals must have
an intrinsic anisotropy. We show that this kind of anisotropy, and consequently
the entanglement in the model, are not necessary for the proper functioning of
the compass. Classically correlated initial conditions for the RP, subjected to
a fast decoherence process, are able to provide the anisotropy required. Even a
dephasing environment can provide the necessary frame for the compass to work,
and also implies fast decay of any quantum correlation in the system without
damaging the orientation ability. This fact significantly expands the range of
applicability of the RP mechanism providing more elements for experimental
search.

it was rejected largely because of preconceived ideas about what appeared to be
an unrealistically high radio and optical luminosity. Following the 1962
occultations of the strong radio source 3C 273 at Parkes, and the subsequent
identification with an apparent stellar object, Maarten Schmidt recognized that
the relatively simple hydrogen line Balmer series spectrum implied a redshift
of 0.16 Successive radio and optical measurements quickly led to the
identification of other quasars with increasingly large redshifts and the
general, although for some decades not universal, acceptance of quasars as
being by far the most distant and the most luminous objects in the Universe.
Curiously, 3C 273, which is one of the strongest extragalactic sources in the
sky, was first cataloged in 1959 and the magnitude 13 optical counterpart was
observed at least as early as 1887. Since 1960, much fainter optical
counterparts were being routinely identified using accurate radio
interferometer positions, measured primarily at the Caltech Owens Valley Radio
Observatory. However, 3C 273 eluded identification until the series of lunar
occultation observations led by Cyril Hazard, although inexplicably there was
an earlier mis-identification with a faint galaxy located about an arc minute
away from the true position. Ironically, due to calculation error, the
occultation position used by Schmidt to determine the redshift of 3C 273 was in
error by 14 arcseconds, and a good occultation position was not derived until
after Schmidt had obtained his 200 inch spectrum.

(IWT). There is no visual difference between the stego image and the cover
image. The extracted secret images are also similar to the original secret

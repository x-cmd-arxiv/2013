imprint recorded in the X-ray background (XRB). The XRB spectral shape suggests
that a large population of distant, hidden nuclei must exist, which are now
being revealed at higher and higher redshifts by the deepest surveys performed
by Chandra and XMM.
  Our current understanding of the XRB emission in terms of AGN population
synthesis models is here reviewed, and the evolutionary path of nuclear
accretion and obscuration, as emerging from the major X-ray surveys, is
investigated. The role of galaxy merging versus secular processes in triggering
nuclear activity is also discussed in the framework of recent galaxy/black hole
co-evolutionary scenarios. Finally, the limits of current instrumentation in
the detection of the most obscured and distant black holes are discussed and
some possible directions to overcome these limits are presented.

of the experiments in order to test such phenomenon is proposed by making

manifests itself in the lowering of the critical magnetic field required for
the appearance of the zero-bias peak, a shift that can be directly measured and

a valuable tool for discovering complicated patterns in data. The term
""nonparametric Bayes"" suggests that these methods inherit model-free operating
characteristics of classical nonparametric methods, as well as coherent
uncertainty assessments provided by Bayesian procedures. However, as the
authors say in the conclusion to their article, nonparametric Bayesian methods
may be more aptly described as ""massively parametric."" Furthermore, I argue
that many of the default nonparametric Bayes procedures are only Bayesian in
the weakest sense of the term, and cannot be assumed to provide honest
assessments of uncertainty merely because they carry the Bayesian label.
However useful such procedures may be, we should be cautious about advertising
default nonparametric Bayes procedures as either being ""assumption free"" or
providing descriptions of our uncertainty. If we want our nonparametric Bayes
procedures to have a Bayesian interpretation, we should modify default NP Bayes
methods to accommodate real prior information, or at the very least, carefully
evaluate the effects of hyperparameters on posterior quantities of interest.

captures the homotopy type of the shape assuming the vertices of the complex
meet some mild sampling conditions. Unfortunately, the Rips complex is
generally high-dimensional. To remedy this problem, it is tempting to simplify
it through a sequence of collapses. Ideally, we would like to end up with a
triangulation of the shape. Experiments suggest that, as we simplify the
complex by iteratively collapsing faces, it should indeed be possible to avoid
entering a dead end such as the famous Bing's house with two rooms. This paper
provides a theoretical justification for this empirical observation.

result, we rely on a recent work which gives conditions under which the Rips
complex can be converted into a Cech complex by a sequence of collapses. We
proceed in two phases. Starting from the Cech complex, we first produce a
sequence of collapses that arrives to the Cech complex, restricted by the
shape. We then apply a sequence of collapses that transforms the result into

metric are assumed to be expressible in power series in $m/r$, with $m$ being
half the Schwarzschild radius of the central body and $r$ a radial coordinate.
The procedure exclusively works for a light ray which may be described as a
perturbation in powers of $G$ of a Minkowskian null geodesic, with $G$ being
the Newtonian gravitational constant. It is shown that the expansion of the
travel time of a photon along such a ray only involves elementary integrals
whatever the order of approximation. An expansion of the impact parameter in
power series of $G$ is also obtained. The method is applied to explicitly
calculate the perturbation expansions of the light travel time and the impact
parameter up to the third order. The full expressions yielding the terms of
order $G^3$ are new. The expression of the travel time confirms the existence
of a third-order enhanced term when the emitter and the receiver are in
conjunction relative to the central body. This term is shown to be necessary
for determining the post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma$ at a level of accuracy of
$10^{-8}$ with light rays grazing the Sun.

The role of charged octet scalar in the loop of Higgs decay into diphoton is
investigated . We point out that the most significant impact of this model on
the diphoton decay width comes from the suppression of top-quark coupling with
SM-like Higgs or even flipping its sign that leads to important enhancement in
\Gamma(h -> gamma gamma). We also study the implications of the neutral

rigorous framework to prescribe the influence of solid walls in SPH for fluid
flows. In this paper they are investigated with respect to the skew-adjoint
property which implies exact energy conservation. It will be shown that this
property holds only in the limit of the continuous SPH approximation, whereas
in the discrete SPH formulation it is only approximately true, leading to
numerical noise. This noise, interpreted as form of ""turbulence"", is treated
using an additional volume diffusion term in the continuity equation which we
show is equivalent to an approximate Riemann solver. Subsequently two
extensions to the boundary conditions are presented. The first dealing with a
variable driving force when imposing a volume flux in a periodic flow and the
second showing a generalization of the wall boundary condition to Robin type
and arbitrary-order interpolation. Two modifications for free-surface flows are
presented for the volume diffusion term as well as the wall boundary condition.
In order to validate the theoretical constructs numerical experiments are
performed showing that the present volume flux term yields results with an
error 5 orders of magnitude smaller then previous methods while the Robin
boundary conditions are imposed correctly with an error depending on the order
of the approximation. Furthermore, the proposed modifications for free-surface
flows improve the behaviour at the intersection of free surface and wall as
well as prevent free-surface detachment when using the volume diffusion term.
Finally, this paper is concluded by a simulation of a dam break over a wedge
demonstrating the improvements proposed in this paper.

spectroscopy observations over two regions of M1-67, covering most of the
nebula in the optical range. Maps of electron density, line ratios, and radial
velocity were created to perform a detailed analysis of the two-dimensional
structure. We studied the physical and chemical properties by means of
integrated spectra selected over the whole nebula. Photoionization models were
performed to confirm the empirical chemical results theoretically. In addition,
we analysed infrared spectroscopic data and the MIPS 24micron image of M1-67
from Spitzer. We find that the ionized gas of M1-67 is condensed in knots
aligned in a preferred axis along the NE-SW direction, like a bipolar
structure. Both electron density and radial velocity decrease in this direction
when moving away from the central star. From the derived electron temperature,
Te~8200 K, we have estimated chemical abundances, obtaining that nitrogen
appears strongly enriched and oxygen depleted. From the last two results, we
infer that this bipolarity is the consequence of an ejection of an evolved
stage of WR124 with material processed in the CNO cycle. The infrared study has
revealed that the bipolar axis is composed of ionized gas with a low ionization
degree that is well mixed with warm dust and of a spherical bubble surrounding
the ejection at 24micron. Taking the evolution of a 60 Mo star and the temporal
scale of the bipolar ejection into account, we propose that the observed gas
was ejected during an eruption in the luminous blue variable. The star has
entered the WR phase recently without apparent signs of interaction between
WR-winds and interstellar material.

course of the last decade in the context of understanding the regulatory logic
of molecular interaction networks, such as gene regulatory networks. Such
functions appear preferentially in published models of such networks. Recently,
this concept has been generalized to include multi-state functions, and a
recursive formula has been derived for their number, as a function of the
number of variables. This paper carries out a detailed analysis of the class of
nested canalizing functions over an arbitrary finite field. Furthermore, the
paper generalizes the concept further, and derives a closed formula for the
number of such generalized functions. The paper also derives a closed formula
for the number of equivalence classes under permutation of variables. This is
motivated by the fact that two nested canalizing functions that differ by a
permutation of the variables share many important properties with each other.
The paper contributes to the effort of identifying a class of functions over
finite fields that are of interest in biology and also have interesting
mathematical properties.

potentially be habitable in order not to discard close-in rocky exoplanets for

hot desert worlds can be as close as 0.38 AU around a solar-like star, if the
greenhouse effect is reduced ($\sim$ 1% relative humidity) and the surface
albedo is increased. We consider a wide range of atmospheric and planetary
parameters such as the mixing ratios of greenhouse gases (water vapor and
CO$_2$), surface albedo, pressure and gravity. Intermediate surface pressure
($\sim$1-10 bars) is necessary to limit water loss and to simultaneously
sustain an active water cycle. We additionally find that the water loss
timescale is influenced by the atmospheric CO$_2$ level, because it indirectly
influences the stratospheric water mixing ratio. If the CO$_2$ mixing ratio of
dry planets at the inner edge is smaller than 10$^{-4}$, the water loss
timescale is $\sim$1 billion years, which is considered here too short for life
to evolve. We also show that the expected transmission spectra of hot desert
worlds are similar to an Earth-like planet. Therefore, an instrument designed
to identify biosignature gases in an Earth-like atmosphere can also identify
similarly abundant gases in the atmospheres of dry planets. Our inner edge
limit is closer to the host star than previous estimates. As a consequence, the
occurrence rate of potentially habitable planets is larger than previously
thought.

function and large-scale clustering bias of the X-ray-selected AGN in the
general framework of the concordance LCDM model. We assume that a simple
population-averaged scaling relation between the AGN X-ray luminosity L_X and
the host dark matter halo mass M_h exists. With such a relation, the AGN X-ray
luminosity function can be computed from the halo mass function. Using the
concordance LCDM halo mass function for the latter, we obtain the M_h-L_X
relation required to match the redshift-dependent AGN X-ray luminosity function
known from X-ray observations. We find that with a simple power-law-scaling M_h
\propto L_X^\Gamma(z), our model can successfully reproduce the observed X-ray
luminosity function. Furthermore, we automatically obtain predictions for the
large-scale AGN clustering amplitudes and their dependence on the luminosity
and redshift, which seem to be compatible with AGN clustering measurements. Our
model also includes the redshift-dependent AGN duty cycle which peaks at the
redshift z ~ 1, and its peak value is consistent with unity, suggesting that on
average there is no more than one AGN per dark matter halo. For a typical
X-ray-selected AGN at z ~ 1, our best-fit M_h-L_X scaling implies low Eddington
ratio L_X/L_Edd ~ 10^{-4}-10^{-3} (2-10 keV band, no bolometric correction
applied) and correspondingly large mass growth e-folding times, suggesting that
the typical X-ray AGN are dominantly fueled via relatively inefficient
'hot-halo' accretion mode.

synthesized by overlapping clouds of positrons ($e^+$) and antiprotons
($\bar{p}$) confined in magnetic Penning traps. Cold $\bar{\rm H}$ was also
produced in collisions between Rydberg positronium atoms and $\bar{p}$.
Ground-state $\bar{\rm H}$ was later trapped for up to $\sim 1000$ s in a
magnetic bottle trap, and microwave transitions excited between its hyperfine
levels. In the $\bar{p}{\rm He}^+$ atom, UV transitions were measured to a
precision of (2.3-5) $\times$ $10^{-9}$ by sub-Doppler two-photon laser
spectroscopy. From this the antiproton-to-electron mass ratio was determined as
$M_{\bar{p}}/m_e=$1836.1526736(23), which agrees with the p value. Microwave
spectroscopy of $\bar{p}{\rm He}^+$ yielded a measurement of the $\bar{p}$
magnetic moment with a precision of 0.3%. More recently the magnetic moment of
a single $\bar{p}$ confined in a Penning trap was measured with a higher

nodal spin-density wave is unstable once spin-orbit coupling is included.
Similar analysis is performed for the A_{1g} spin singlet superconducting

Gamma point, but two near the M point. This leads to an isotropic spectral gap
at the hole Fermi surface near Gamma, but anisotropic near M. The relative
values of these three parameters determine whether the superconducting state is

mixing of spin triplet pairing, with one additional pairing parameter near

reduces to a capped unitary matrix model. The matrix models corresponding to
several specific matter Chern-Simons theories at temperature $T$ were
determined in arXiv:1301.6169. The large $N$ saddle point equations for these
theories were determined in the same paper, and were solved in the low
temperature phase. In this paper we find exact solutions for these saddle point
equations in three other phases of these theories and thereby explicitly
determine the free energy of the corresponding theories at all values of
$T^2/N$. As anticipated on general grounds in arXiv:1301.6169, our results are
in perfect agreement with conjectured level rank type bosonization dualities
between pairs of such theories.

matter haloes in the young Universe. As a consequence they are likely to be
markers for biased, over-dense regions where early galaxies cluster, regions
that eventually grow into the groups and clusters seen in the lower redshift
universe. In this paper we explore the clustering of galaxies around z ~ 5 QSOs
as traced by Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs). We target the fields of three QSOs
using the same optical imaging and spectroscopy techniques used in the ESO
Remote Galaxy Survey (ERGS, Douglas et al. 2009, 2010), which was successful in
identifying individual clustered structures of LBGs. We use the statistics of
the redshift clustering in ERGS to show that two of the three fields show
significant clustering of LBGs at the QSO redshifts. Neither of these fields is
obviously over-dense in LBGs from the imaging alone; a possible reason why
previous imaging-only studies of high-redshift QSO environments have given
ambiguous results. This result shows that luminous QSOs at z ~ 5 are typically
found in over-dense regions. The richest QSO field contains at least nine
spectroscopically confirmed objects at the same redshift including the QSO
itself, seven LBGs and a second fainter QSO. While this is a very strong
observational signal of clustering at z ~ 5, it is of similar strength to that
seen in two structures identified in the 'blank sky' ERGS fields. This
indicates that, while over-dense, the QSO environments are not more extreme
than other structures that can be identified at these redshifts. The three
richest structures discovered in this work and in ERGS have properties
consistent with that expected for proto-clusters and likely represent the early
stages in the build-up of massive current-day groups and clusters.

coordinates. The Lagrangian 1-form of charged particle dynamics is Lie
transformed without introducing a gyro-gauge, but using directly the unit
vector of the component of the velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field as
the coordinate corresponding to Larmor gyration. The reduction is shown to
provide a maximal reduction for the Lagrangian and to work to all orders in the
Larmor radius, following exactly the same procedure as when working with the
standard gauge-dependent coordinate. The gauge-dependence is removed from the
coordinate system by using a constrained variable for the gyro-angle. The
closed 1-form d teta is replaced by a more general non-closed 1-form, which is
equal to d theta in the gauge-dependent case. The gauge vector is replaced by a
more general connection in the definition of the gradient, which behaves as a
covariant derivative, in perfect agreement with the circle-bundle picture. This
explains some results of previous works, whose gauge-independent expressions
did not correspond to a gauge fixing but indeed correspond to a connection
fixing. In addition, some general results are obtained for the guiding-center
reduction. The expansion is polynomial in the cotangent of the pitch-angle as
an effect of the structure of the Lagrangian, preserved by Lie derivatives. The
induction for the reduction is shown to rely on the inversion of a matrix which
is the same for all orders higher than three. It is inverted and explicit
induction relations are obtained to go to arbitrary order in the perturbation
expansion. The Hamiltonian and symplectic representations of the guiding-center
reduction are recovered, but conditions for the symplectic representation at
each order are emphasized.

waves driven by periodic gravitational perturbations. In other parts of
Saturn's rings, such waves are generated by Lindblad resonances with Saturn's
various moons, but most of the wave-like C-ring features are not situated near
any strong resonance with any known moon. Using stellar occultation data
obtained by the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) onboard the
Cassini spacecraft, we investigate the origin of six unidentified C-ring waves
located between 80,900 and 87,200 km from Saturn's center. By measuring
differences in the waves' phases among the different occultations, we are able
to determine both the number of arms in each spiral pattern and the speeds at
which these patterns rotate around the planet. We find that all six of these
waves have between 2 and 4 arms and pattern speeds between 1660 degrees/day and
1861 degrees/day. These speeds are too large to be attributed to any satellite
resonance. Instead they are comparable to the predicted pattern speeds of waves
generated by low-order normal-mode oscillations within the planet [Marley &
Porco 1993, Icarus 106, 508]. The precise pattern speeds associated with these
waves should therefore provide strong constraints on Saturn's internal
structure. Furthermore, we identify multiple waves with the same number of arms
and very similar pattern speeds, indicating that multiple m=3 and m=2 sectoral
(l=m) modes may exist within the planet.

dietary preferences as expressed via recipe access has two main periodic

The Galerkin method is successfully implemented to numerically compute
approximate solutions for bounded flows. The Chandrasekhar functions revealed
to ensure a fifth order of accuracy. The focus of the subsequent analysis is on
the transient behavior of the perturbation frequency and phase velocity. The
results confirm recent observations about a jump in the temporal evolution of
the frequency of the wall-normal velocity signal, considered as the end of an
Early Transient. After this jump, the wave frequency for Plane Couette flow
experiences a periodic modulation about the asymptotic value, which is
motivated and investigated in detail. A new result is the presence of a second
frequency jump for the wall-normal vorticity. This fact, together with the
possibility for different values of the signals asymptotic frequency, shows the
existence of an Intermediate Transient. Moreover, a connection between the
frequency jumps and the establishing of a self-similarity condition in time for
both the velocity and vorticity profiles is found and investigated for both
Plane Couette flow and Plane Poiseuille flow. Eventually, through superposition
of waves with limited wavenumber range, a wave packet is reconstructed for
Plane Couette flow and Blasius boundary-layer flow . The linear spot evolution
revealed to have many common features with the early stages of a turbulent

simple process to speed up ML methods. An unsupervised clustering algorithm is
combined with Expectation, Maximization (EM) algorithm to develop an efficient
Hidden Markov Model (HMM) training. The idea of the proposed process consists
of two steps. In the first step, training instances with similar inputs are
clustered and a weight factor which represents the frequency of these instances
is assigned to each representative cluster. Dynamic Time Warping technique is
used as a dissimilarity function to cluster similar examples. In the second
step, all formulas in the classical HMM training algorithm (EM) associated with
the number of training instances are modified to include the weight factor in
appropriate terms. This process significantly accelerates HMM training while
maintaining the same initial, transition and emission probabilities matrixes as
those obtained with the classical HMM training algorithm. Accordingly, the
classification accuracy is preserved. Depending on the size of the training
set, speedups of up to 2200 times is possible when the size is about 100.000
instances. The proposed approach is not limited to training HMMs, but it can be
employed for a large variety of MLs methods.

IV, as well as the He II 1640 A line, act as diagnostics of the accretion
process. Here we assemble a large high-resolution dataset of these lines in
CTTSs and Weak T Tauri Stars (WTTSs). We present data for 35 stars: one Herbig
Ae star, 28 CTTSs, and 6 WTTSs. We decompose the C IV and He II lines into
broad and narrow Gaussian components (BC & NC). The most common (50 %) C IV
line morphology in CTTSs is that of a low-velocity NC together with a
redshifted BC. The velocity centroids of the BCs and NCs are such that V_BC > 4
* V_NC, consistent with the predictions of the accretion shock model, in at
most 12 out of 22 CTTSs. We do not find evidence of the post-shock becoming
buried in the stellar photosphere due to the pressure of the accretion flow.
The He II CTTSs lines are generally symmetric and narrow, less redshifted than
the CTTSs C IV lines, by ~10 km/sec. The flux in the BC of the He II line is
small compared to that of the C IV line, consistent with models of the
pre-shock column emission. The observations are consistent with the presence of
multiple accretion columns with different densities or with accretion models
that predict a slow-moving, low-density region in the periphery of the
accretion column. For HN Tau A and RW Aur A, most of the C IV line is
blueshifted suggesting that the C IV emission is produced by shocks within
outflow jets. In our sample, the Herbig Ae star DX Cha is the only object for
which we find a P-Cygni profile in the C IV line, which argues for the presence
of a hot (10^5 K) wind. For the overall sample, the Si IV and N V line
luminosities are correlated with the C IV line luminosities, although the
relationship between Si IV and C IV shows large scatter about a linear
relationship and suggests that TW Hya, V4046 Sgr, AA Tau, DF Tau, GM Aur, and
V1190 Sco are silicon-poor.

Explanations of the maintenance of cooperation generally assume that

accurately. However, humans have a well known capacity to deceive and thus to
manipulate how others assess their behavior. Here, we show that hypocrisy -
claiming to be acting cooperatively while acting selfishly - can maintain

fast Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and are not all powerful X-ray flares. We

impulsive flare followed by slowly varying gamma-ray emission over 13 hours,
and the 2011 June 7 M2.5 flare, which was followed by gamma-ray emission
lasting for 2 hours. We compare the Fermi-LAT data with X-ray and proton data
measurements from GOES and RHESSI. We argue that a hadronic origin of the gamma
rays is more likely than a leptonic origin and find that the energy spectrum of
the proton distribution softens after the 2011 March 7 flare, favoring a
scenario with continuous acceleration at the flare site. This work suggests
that proton acceleration in solar flares is more common than previously
thought, occurring for even modest X-ray flares, and for longer durations.

sequencing instruments cannot completely reconstruct microbial chromosomes.
Therefore, most genomes have been left unfinished due to the significant
resources required to manually close gaps in draft assemblies.
Third-generation, single-molecule sequencing addresses this problem by greatly
increasing sequencing read length, which simplifies the assembly problem.
  Results: To measure the benefit of single-molecule sequencing on microbial
genome assembly, we sequenced and assembled the genomes of six bacteria and
analyzed the repeat complexity of 2,267 complete bacteria and archaea. Our
results indicate that the majority of known bacterial and archaeal genomes can
be assembled without gaps, at finished-grade quality, using a single PacBio RS
sequencing library. These single-library assemblies are also more accurate than
typical short-read assemblies and hybrid assemblies of short and long reads.
  Conclusions: Automated assembly of long, single-molecule sequencing data
reduces the cost of microbial finishing to $1,000 for most genomes, and future
advances in this technology are expected to drive the cost lower. This is
expected to increase the number of completed genomes, improve the quality of
microbial genome databases, and enable high-fidelity, population-scale studies
of pan-genomes and chromosomal organization.

\in \{0,1\}^d$ with a given value in each of a given set of up to $k$ columns.
Marginal queries enable a rich class of statistical analyses on a dataset, and
designing efficient algorithms for privately answering marginal queries has
been identified as an important open problem in private data analysis.
  For any $k$, we give a differentially private online algorithm that runs in
time $$ \min{\exp(d^{1-\Omega(1/\sqrt{k})}), \exp(d / \log^{.99} d)\} $$ per
query and answers any (possibly superpolynomially long and adaptively chosen)

  Our algorithms are a variant of the private multiplicative weights algorithm
(Hardt and Rothblum, FOCS '10), but using a different low-weight representation

that pointwise approximates the $d$-variate OR function on all inputs of
Hamming weight at most $k$ must have degree $d^{1-O(1/\sqrt{k})}$.

general approach to evolutionary processes in the computational context,
building mathematical models of computational systems, functioning of which is
based on evolutionary processes, and studying properties of such systems.
Operations with evolutionary machines are described and it is explored when
definite classes of evolutionary machines are closed with respect to basic
operations with these machines. We also study such properties as linguistic and
functional equivalence of evolutionary machines and their classes, as well as
computational power of evolutionary machines and their classes, comparing of
evolutionary machines to conventional automata, such as finite automata or
Turing machines.

been shown that in two-dimensional (2D) and 1D chiral superconductors, the
isolated Majorana fermions obey non-Abelian statistics. However, Majorana modes
in a $Z_2$ time-reversal invariant (TRI) topological superconductor come in
pairs due to Kramers' theorem. Therefore, braiding operations in TRI
superconductors always exchange two pairs of Majoranas. In this work, we show
interestingly that, due to the protection of time-reversal symmetry,
non-Abelian statistics can be obtained in 1D TRI topological superconductors
and may have advantages in applying to topological quantum computation.
Furthermore, we unveil an intriguing phenomenon in the Josephson effect, that
the periodicity of Josephson currents depends on the fermion parity of the
superconducting state. This effect provides direct measurements of the
topological qubit states in such 1D TRI superconductors.

Telescope (UKIRT), of the Local Group spiral galaxy M33 (Triangulum). The main
aim was to identify stars in the very final stage of their evolution, and for
which the luminosity is more directly related to the birth mass than the more
numerous less-evolved giant stars that continue to increase in luminosity. In
this third paper of the series, we measure the dust production and rates of
mass loss by the pulsating Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars and red
supergiants. To this aim, we combined our time-averaged near-IR photometry with
the multi-epoch mid-IR photometry obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope.
The mass-loss rates are seen to increase with increasing strength of pulsation
and with increasing bolometric luminosity. Low-mass stars lose most of their
mass through stellar winds, but even super-AGB stars and red supergiants lose
$\sim40$% of their mass via a dusty stellar wind. More than three-quarters of
the dust return is oxygenous. We construct a 2-D map of the mass-return rate,
showing a radial decline but also local enhancements due to agglomerations of
massive stars. We estimate a total mass-loss rate of 0.004--0.005 M$_\odot$
yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$, increasing to $\sim0.006$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$
when accounting for eruptive mass loss (e.g., supernov{\ae}); comparing this to
the current star formation rate of $\sim0.03$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$ we
conclude that star formation in the central region of M\,33 can only be
sustained if gas is accreted from further out in the disc or from
circum-galactic regions.

single atom interacting resonantly with two fixed static centers. At a Feshbach
resonance point with orbital angular momentum $L\ge1$, we find $2L+1$ shallow
bound states whose energies behave like $1/R^{2L+1}$ when the distance $R$

energies due to other parameters in the effective range expansions. For
completeness we also compute the binding energies near s-wave Feshbach

bound states at large but finite scattering volumes. For p-wave and higher
partial wave resonances, we derive a simple formula for the energies in terms
of a parameter called ""proximity parameter"". These results are applicable to a
free atom interacting resonantly with two atoms that are localized to two
lattice sites of an optical lattice, and to one light atom interacting with two
heavy ones in free space. Modifications of the low energy physics due to the

a large influence to convert the cooperation of other nodes to defection.
Simulations on methionyl-tRNA synthetase protein structure network indicated an
increased influence of nodes belonging to intra-protein signaling pathways on

convert the cooperation of other nodes to defection in social dilemma games may
be an important measure to predict the importance of nodes in the integration

loop and a suddenly imposed velocity perturbation can propel the prominence to
oscillate along the magnetic dip. An extensive parameter survey results in a
scaling law, showing that the period of the oscillation, which weakly depends
on the length and height of the prominence, and the amplitude of the
perturbations, scales with $\sqrt{R/g_\odot}$, where $R$ represents the
curvature radius of the dip, and $g_\odot$ is the gravitational acceleration of
the Sun. This is consistent with the linear theory of a pendulum, which implies
that the field-aligned component of gravity is the main restoring force for the
prominence longitudinal oscillations, as confirmed by the force analysis.
However, the gas pressure gradient becomes non-negligible for short
prominences. The oscillation damps with time in the presence of non-adiabatic
processes. Compared to heat conduction, the radiative cooling is the dominant
factor leading to the damping. A scaling law for the damping timescale is
derived, i.e., $\tau\sim l^{1.63} D^{0.66}w^{-1.21}v_{0}^{-0.30}$, showing
strong dependence on the prominence length $l$, the geometry of the magnetic
dip (characterized by the depth $D$ and the width $w$), and the velocity
perturbation amplitude $v_0$. The larger the amplitude, the faster the
oscillation damps. It is also found that mass drainage significantly reduces

entropy come from? Curiously, there exist gravitational configurations that
possess even larger entropy than a black hole of the same mass, in fact,
arbitrarily high entropy. These are the so-called monsters, which are
problematic to the Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT)
correspondence paradigm since there is far insufficient degrees of freedom on
the field theory side to account for the enormous entropy of monsters in AdS
bulk. The physics of the bulk however may be considerably modified at
semi-classical level due to the presence of branes. We show that this is
especially so since monster spacetimes are unstable due to brane nucleation. As
a consequence, it is not clear what the final fate of monsters is. We argue
that in some cases there is no real threat from monsters since although they

makes it possible to estimate the empirical cost function of individual
routines of a program, helping developers understand how performance scales to
larger inputs and pinpoint asymptotic bottlenecks in the code. A current
limitation of input-sensitive profilers is that they specifically target
sequential computations, ignoring any communication between threads. In this
paper we show how to overcome this limitation, extending the range of
applicability of the original approach to multithreaded applications and to
applications that operate on I/O streams. We develop new metrics for
automatically estimating the size of the input given to each routine
activation, addressing input produced by non-deterministic memory stores
performed by other threads as well as by the OS kernel (e.g., in response to
I/O or network operations). We provide real case studies, showing that our
extension allows it to characterize the behavior of complex applications more
precisely than previous approaches. An extensive experimental investigation on
a variety of benchmark suites (including the SPEC OMP2012 and the PARSEC
benchmarks) shows that our Valgrind-based input-sensitive profiler incurs an
overhead comparable to other prominent heavyweight analysis tools, while
collecting significantly more performance points from each profiling session
and correctly characterizing both thread-induced and external input.

  shallow water equations and application to thin film flows","8 figures",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we study the stability of various difference approximations of
the Euler-Korteweg equations. This system of evolution PDEs is a classical
isentropic Euler system perturbed by a dispersive (third order) term. The Euler
equations are discretized with a classical scheme (e.g. Roe, Rusanov or
Lax-Friedrichs scheme) whereas the dispersive term is discretized with centered
finite differences. We first prove that a certain amount of numerical viscosity
is needed for a difference scheme to be stable in the Von Neumann sense. Then
we consider the entropy stability of difference approximations. For that
purpose, we introduce an additional unknown, the gradient of a function of the
density. The Euler-Korteweg system is transformed into a hyperbolic system
perturbed by a second order skew symmetric term. We prove entropy stability of
Lax-Friedrichs type schemes under a suitable Courant-Friedrichs-Levy condition.
We validate our approach numerically on a simple case and then carry out
numerical simulations of a shallow water system with surface tension which
models thin films down an incline. In addition, we propose a spatial
discretization of the Euler-Korteweg system seen as a Hamiltonian system of
evolution PDEs. This spatial discretization preserves the Hamiltonian structure
and thus is naturally entropy conservative. This scheme makes possible the
numerical simulation of the dispersive shock waves of the Euler Korteweg
system.

  We are grateful to Michael Walfish for identifying the error",,,,"cs.CR cs.CC cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, researchers have been working toward the development of practical
general-purpose protocols for verifiable computation. These protocols enable a
computationally weak verifier to offload computations to a powerful but
untrusted prover, while providing the verifier with a guarantee that the prover
performed the computations correctly. Despite substantial progress, existing
implementations are not yet practical. The main bottleneck is typically the
extra effort required by the prover to return an answer with a guarantee of
correctness, compared to returning an answer with no guarantee.
  We describe a refinement of a powerful interactive proof protocol originally
due to Goldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum. Cormode, Mitzenmacher, and Thaler show
how to implement the prover in this protocol in time O(S log S), where S is the
size of an arithmetic circuit computing the function of interest. Our
refinements apply to circuits whose wiring pattern is sufficiently ""regular"";
for these circuits, we bring the runtime of the prover down to O(S). That is,
our prover can evaluate the circuit with a guarantee of correctness, with only
a constant-factor blowup in work compared to evaluating the circuit with no
guarantee.
  We argue that our refinements capture a large class of circuits, and prove
some theorems formalizing this. Experimentally, our refinements yield a 200x
speedup for the prover over the implementation of Cormode et al., and our
prover is less than 10x slower than a C++ program that simply evaluates the
circuit. Along the way, we describe a special-purpose protocol for matrix
multiplication that is of interest in its own right.
  Our final contribution is a protocol targeted at general data parallel
computation. Compared to prior work, this protocol can more efficiently verify
complicated computations as long as that computation is applied independently
to many pieces of data.

data streams and variants thereof. In this setting, a computationally weak
verifier (cloud user), lacking the resources to store and manipulate his
massive input locally, accesses a powerful but untrusted prover (cloud
service). The verifier must work within the restrictive data streaming
paradigm. The prover, who can annotate the data stream as it is read, must not
just supply the answer but also convince the verifier of its correctness.
Ideally, both the amount of annotation and the space used by the verifier
should be sublinear in the relevant input size parameters.
  A rich theory of such algorithms -- which we call schemes -- has emerged.
Prior work has shown how to leverage the prover's power to efficiently solve
problems that have no non-trivial standard data stream algorithms. However,
while optimal schemes are now known for several basic problems, such optimality
holds only for streams whose length is commensurate with the size of the data
universe. In contrast, many real-world datasets are relatively sparse,
including graphs that contain only O(n^2) edges, and IP traffic streams that
contain much fewer than the total number of possible IP addresses, 2^128 in
IPv6.
  We design the first schemes that allow both the annotation and the space
usage to be sublinear in the total number of stream updates rather than the
size of the data universe. We solve significant problems, including variations
of INDEX, SET-DISJOINTNESS, and FREQUENCY-MOMENTS, plus several natural
problems on graphs. On the other hand, we give a new lower bound that, for the
first time, rules out smooth tradeoffs between annotation and space usage for a
specific problem. Our technique brings out new nuances in Merlin-Arthur
communication complexity models, and provides a separation between online

function to the average dissipation rate of turbulence, in a uniformly
expanding solar wind by using the two scales expansion model of
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. We show that due to the expansion of the
solar wind two new terms appear in the Yaglom law. The first term is related to
the decay of the turbulent energy by nonlinear interactions, whereas the second
term is related to the non-zero cross-correlation of the Els\""asser fields.
Using magnetic field and plasma data from WIND and Helios 2 spacecrafts, we
show that at lower frequencies in the inertial range of MHD turbulence the new
terms become comparable to Yaglom's third order mixed moment, and therefore
they cannot be neglected in the evaluation of the energy cascade rate in the
solar wind.

observables is not always reduced by the amount of entanglement (quantum

correlations beyond entanglement (discord). An optimal lower bound of entropic
uncertainty in the presence of any correlations may be determined by
fine-graining. Here we express the uncertainty relation in a new form where the
maximum possible reduction of uncertainty is shown to be given by the
extractable classical information. We show that the lower bound of uncertainty
matches with that using fine-graining for several examples of two-qubit pure

  Using our uncertainty relation we further show that even in the absence of
any quantum correlations between the two parties, the sum of uncertainties may
be reduced with the help of classical correlations.

""$-1$-shifted symplectic derived schemes"".
  They show that intersections of algebraic Lagrangians in a smooth symplectic

  This paper defines and studies a new class of spaces we call ""algebraic
d-critical loci"", which should be regarded as classical truncations of
$-1$-shifted symplectic derived schemes. They are simpler than their derived
analogues. We also give a complex analytic version of the theory, ""complex

quantum-mechanical calculations of the sensitivity coefficients of such
transitions to tiny changes in alpha and mu for a number of molecules which are
usually observed in Galactic and extragalactic sources, and discusses the
possibility of testing the space- and time-invariance of fundamental constants

CH3NH2 in their tunneling and tunneling-rotational modes are considered. It is
shown that sensitivity coefficients strongly depend on the quantum numbers of
the corresponding transitions. This can be used for astrophysical tests of
Einstein's Equivalence Principle all over the Universe at an unprecedented
level of sensitivity of ~10^-9, which is a limit three to two orders of

significantly enhance both the pairing gap and condensate fraction and lead to

a marginal inconsistency with a cosmological constant in a flat universe.

  Establishing an isogenic population genetic resource in fish","5 figures, 30 pages",,,,"q-bio.GN q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background Oryzias latipes (Medaka) has been established as a vertebrate
genetic model for over a century, and has recently been rediscovered outside
its native Japan. The power of new sequencing methods now makes it possible to
reinvigorate Medaka genetics, in particular by establishing a near-isogenic
panel derived from a single wild population. Results Here we characterise the
genomes of wild Medaka catches obtained from a single Southern Japanese
population in Kiyosu as a precursor for the establishment of a near isogenic
panel of wild lines. The population is free of significant detrimental
population structure, and has advantageous linkage disequilibrium properties
suitable for establishment of the proposed panel. Analysis of morphometric
traits in five representative inbred strains suggests phenotypic mapping will
be feasible in the panel. In addition high throughput genome sequencing of
these Medaka strains confirms their evolutionary relationships on lines of
geographic separation and provides further evidence that there has been little
significant interbreeding between the Southern and Northern Medaka population
since the Southern/Northern population split. The sequence data suggest that
the Southern Japanese Medaka existed as a larger older population which went
through a relatively recent bottleneck around 10,000 years ago. In addition we
detect patterns of recent positive selection in the Southern population.
Conclusions These data indicate that the genetic structure of the Kiyosu Medaka
samples are suitable for the establishment of a vertebrate near isogenic panel
and therefore inbreeding of 200 lines based on this population has commenced.

showed that a function f:N^k --> N^l is deterministically computable by a
stochastic chemical reaction network (CRN) if and only if the graph of f is a
semilinear subset of N^{k+l}. That construction crucially used ""leaders"": the
ability to start in an initial configuration with constant but non-zero counts
of species other than the k species X_1,...,X_k representing the input to the
function f. The authors asked whether deterministic CRNs without a leader
retain the same power.
  We answer this question affirmatively, showing that every semilinear function
is deterministically computable by a CRN whose initial configuration contains
only the input species X_1,...,X_k, and zero counts of every other species. We
show that this CRN completes in expected time O(n), where n is the total number
of input molecules. This time bound is slower than the O(log^5 n) achieved in
[1], but faster than the O(n log n) achieved by the direct construction of [1]
(Theorem 4.1 in the latest online version of [1]), since the fast construction
of that paper (Theorem 4.4) relied heavily on the use of a fast, error-prone
CRN that computes arbitrary computable functions, and which crucially uses a
leader.

RHESSI to determine the energy release rate from magnetic reconnection that
forms and heats numerous flare loops. The flare exhibits two ribbons in UV 1600
{\AA} emission. Analysis shows that the UV light curve at each flaring pixel
rises impulsively within a few minutes, and decays slowly with a timescale >10
min. Since the lower atmosphere (transition region and chromosphere) responds
to energy deposit nearly instantaneously, the rapid UV brightening is thought
to reflect the energy release process in the newly formed flare loop rooted at
the footpoint. We utilize spatially resolved (down to 1 arcsec) UV light curves
and thick-target hard X-ray emission to construct heating functions of a few
thousand flare loops anchored at UV foot points, and compute plasma evolution
in these loops using the EBTEL model. The modeled coronal temperatures and
densities of these flare loops are used to calculate synthetic soft X-ray
spectra and light curves, which compare favorably with those observed by RHESSI
and GOES/XRS. The time-dependent transition region DEM for each loop during its
decay phase is also computed with a simplified model and used to calculate the
optically-thin C IV line emission, which dominates the UV 1600 {\AA} bandpass
during the flare. The computed C IV line emission decays at the same rate as
observed. This study presents a method to constrain heating of
reconnection-formed flare loops using all available observables independently,
and provides insight into the physics of energy release and plasma heating
during the flare. With this method, the lower limit of the total energy used to
heat the flare loops in this event is estimated to be 1.22e31 ergs, of which
only 1.9e30 ergs is carried by beam-driven upflows during the impulsive phase,
suggesting that the coronal plasmas are predominantly heated in situ.

quarkonium hybrid operators with various $J^{PC}$ quantum numbers to include
QCD condensates up to dimension six. In contrast to previous analyses which
were unable to optimize the QCD sum-rules for certain $J^{PC}$, recent work has
shown that inclusion of dimension six condensates stabilizes the hybrid
sum-rules and permits reliable mass predictions. In this work we have
investigated the effects of the dimension six condensates on the remaining
channels. After performing the QCD sum-rule analysis, we update the mass
spectra of charmonium and bottomonium hybrids with exotic and non-exotic
quantum numbers. We identify that the negative-parity states with $J^{PC}=(0,
1, 2)^{-+}, 1^{--}$ form the lightest hybrid supermultiplet while the
positive-parity states with $J^{PC}=(0, 1)^{+-}, (0, 1, 2)^{++}$ belong to a
heavier hybrid supermultiplet, confirming the supermultiplet structure found in
other approaches. The hybrid with $J^{PC}=0^{--}$ has a much higher mass which
may suggest a different excitation of the gluonic field compared to other
channels. In agreement with previous results, we find that the $J^{PC}=1^{++}$
charmonium hybrid is substantially heavier than the X(3872), which seems to
preclude a pure charmonium hybrid interpretation for this state.

projects carries large risks and easily might disrupt operations, waste
taxpayers' money, and create negative publicity. Because of the high risks it
is important that government leaders manage the attendant risks. We analysed a
sample of 1,355 public sector IT projects. The sample included large-scale
projects, on average the actual expenditure was $130 million and the average
duration was 35 months. Our findings showed that the typical project had no
cost overruns and took on average 24% longer than initially expected. However,
comparing the risk distribution with the normative model of a thin-tailed
distribution, projects' actual costs should fall within -30% and +25% of the
budget in nearly 99 out of 100 projects. The data showed, however, that a
staggering 18% of all projects are outliers with cost overruns >25%. Tests
showed that the risk of outliers is even higher for standard software (24%) as
well as in certain project types, e.g., data management (41%), office
management (23%), eGovernment (21%) and management information systems (20%).
Analysis showed also that projects duration adds risk: every additional year of
project duration increases the average cost risk by 4.2 percentage points.
Lastly, we suggest four solutions that public sector organization can take: (1)
benchmark your organization to know where you are, (2) de-bias your IT project
decision-making, (3) reduce the complexities of your IT projects, and (4)
develop Masterbuilders to learn from the best in the field.

of various dielectrics at low temperature. For the purpose of examining the
microscopic loss mechanisms in dielectrics, precise measurements of the
internal quality factor at different values of energy stored in the resonators
are required. Here, we present a consistent method to analyze a LC
superconducting resonator coupled to a transmission line. We first derive an
approximate expression for the transmission S-parameter $S_{21}$ based on a
complete circuit model. In the weak coupling limit, we show that the internal
quality factor is reliably determined by fitting the approximate form of
$S_{21}$. Since the voltage $V$ of the capacitor of the LC circuit is required
to determine the energy stored in the resonator, we next calculate the relation
between $V$ and the forward propagating wave voltage $V_{in}^+$. Due to the
dependence of the quality factor on voltage, $V$ is not simply proportional to
$V_{in}^+$. We find a self-consistent way to determine the relation between $V$
and $V_{in}^+$, which employs only the fitting parameters for $S_{21}$ and a
linear scaling factor. We then examine the resonator transmission in the cases
of port reflection and impedance mismatch. We find that resonator transmission
asymmetry is primarily due to the reflection from discontinuity in transmission
lines. We show that our analysis method to extract the internal quality factor
is robust in the non-ideal cases above. Finally, we show that the analysis
method on LC resonator can be generalize to arbitrary weakly coupled lumped and
distributed resonators. The generalization uses a systematic approximation on
the response function based on the pole and zero which are the closest to the
resonance frequency. This Closest Pole and Zero Method (CPZM) is a valuable
tool for analyzing physical measurements of high-Q resonators.

algorithm is viable for any L\'evy process whose law at an independent,
exponentially distributed time consists of a (possibly infinite) mixture of
exponentials. This includes Brownian motion plus (hyper)exponential jumps, but
also the recently introduced rich class of so-called meromorphic L\'evy
processes, cf. Kyprianou et al [16]. This class contains all L\'evy processes
whose L\'evy measure is an infinite mixture of exponentials which can generate
both finite and infinite jump activity. L\'evy processes well known in
mathematical finance can in a straightforward way be obtained as a limit of
meromorphic L\'evy processes. We work out the algorithm in detail for the
classic example of the American put, and we illustrate the results with some
numerics.

homogeneous appearance when viewed with the naked eye, however, to observe them
at the nanoscale is possible to understand the heterogeneity of its components.
The same phenomenon can occur in pattern recognition in which it is possible to
see heterogeneous patterns in texture images. However, current methods of
texture analysis can not adequately describe such heterogeneous patterns.
Common methods used by researchers analyse the image information in a global
way, taking all its features in an integrated manner. Furthermore, multi-scale
analysis verifies the patterns at different scales, but still preserving the
homogeneous analysis. On the other hand various methods use textons to
represent the texture, breaking texture down into its smallest unit. To tackle
this problem, we propose a method to identify texture patterns not small as
textons at distinct scales enhancing the separability among different types of
texture. We find sub patterns of texture according to the scale and then group
similar patterns for a more refined analysis. Tests were performed in four
static texture databases and one dynamic one. Results show that our method
provides better classification rate compared with conventional approaches both
in static and in dynamic texture.

in wireless technologies such as cellular devices and Bluetooth increase the
mobility users experience while wearing a body sensor network. When connected
by the proper framework, BSNs can efficiently monitor and record data while
minimizing the energy expenditure of nodes in the BSN. Social networking sites
play a large role in the aggregation and sharing of data between many users.
Connecting a BSN to a social network creates the unique ability to share health
related data with other users through social interaction. In this research, we
present an integration of BSNs and social networks to establish a community
promoting well being and great social awareness. We present the system
architecture; both hardware and software, of a prototype implementation using

graph theory. Although by now there is a good understanding of the structure of
graphs based on their edge connectivity, our knowledge in the case of vertex
connectivity is much more limited. An essential tool in capturing edge
connectivity are edge-disjoint spanning trees. The famous results of Tutte and
Nash-Williams show that a graph with edge connectivity $\lambda$ contains
$\floor{\lambda/2}$ edge-disjoint spanning trees.
  We present connected dominating set (CDS) partition and packing as tools that
are analogous to edge-disjoint spanning trees and that help us to better grasp
the structure of graphs based on their vertex connectivity. The objective of
the CDS partition problem is to partition the nodes of a graph into as many
connected dominating sets as possible. The CDS packing problem is the
corresponding fractional relaxation, where CDSs are allowed to overlap as long
as this is compensated by assigning appropriate weights. CDS partition and CDS
packing can be viewed as the counterparts of the well-studied edge-disjoint
spanning trees, focusing on vertex disjointedness rather than edge
disjointness.
  We constructively show that every $k$-vertex-connected graph with $n$ nodes
has a CDS packing of size $\Omega(k/\log n)$ and a CDS partition of size
$\Omega(k/\log^5 n)$. We prove that the $\Omega(k/\log n)$ CDS packing bound is
existentially optimal.
  Using CDS packing, we show that if vertices of a $k$-vertex-connected graph
are independently sampled with probability $p$, then the graph induced by the
sampled vertices has vertex connectivity $\tilde{\Omega}(kp^2)$. Moreover,
using our $\Omega(k/\log n)$ CDS packing, we get a store-and-forward broadcast
algorithm with optimal throughput in the networking model where in each round,
each node can send one bounded-size message to all its neighbors.

give information about various interesting properties of knots, such as which
knots are ribbon. However, while closed-form solutions (as opposed to solutions
which can only be approximated to successively higher degrees) are needed for
this purpose, such solutions have proven elusive, partly as a result of the
non-commutative nature of the algebra. To make the problem more tractable, we
restrict our attention to solutions of the equations in the subalgebra of
horizontal chord diagrams, viewed as a graded unital permutative algebra --
where `permutative' means that u[x,y]=0 whenever u has degree at least 1. We
show that this restriction leads in a straightforward and fairly short way to a
reduction of the hexagon and pentagon equations to a simpler equation taken
over the algebra of power series in two commuting variables. This equation had
been found and solved explicitly by Kurlin under a superficially different set
of reduction assumptions, which we show here are in fact equivalent to ours.

$1\le k\le K$, and $N_j$ antennas at receiver $j$, $1\le j\le K$, denoted as a
$(K,[M_k],[N_j])$ channel. Relying on a result of simultaneous Diophantine
approximation, a real interference alignment scheme with joint receive antenna
processing is developed. The scheme is used to obtain an achievable DoF region.
The proposed DoF region includes two previously known results as special cases,
namely 1) the total DoF of a $K$-user interference channel with $N$ antennas at
each node, $(K, [N], [N])$ channel, is $NK/2$; and 2) the total DoF of a $(K,
[M], [N])$ channel is at least $KMN/(M+N)$. We next explore
constant-coefficient interference networks with $K$ transmitters and $J$
receivers, all having $N$ antennas. Each transmitter emits an independent
message and each receiver requests an arbitrary subset of the messages.
Employing the novel joint receive antenna processing, the DoF region for this
set-up is obtained. We finally consider wireless X networks where each node is
allowed to have an arbitrary number of antennas. It is shown that the joint
receive antenna processing can be used to establish an achievable DoF region,
which is larger than what is possible with antenna splitting. As a special case
of the derived achievable DoF region for constant coefficient X network, the
total DoF of wireless X networks with the same number of antennas at all nodes
and with joint antenna processing is tight while the best inner bound based on
antenna splitting cannot meet the outer bound. Finally, we obtain a DoF region
outer bound based on the technique of transmitter grouping.

superconductor Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2. Resistivity measurements reveal that Cu and Ni
impurities suppress superconducting transition temperature T_c with rates of
\Delta T_c/Cu-1% = -3.5 K and \Delta T_c/Ni-1% = -2.9 K respectively.
Temperature dependence of Hall coefficient R_H of these two series of samples
show that both Cu-doping and Ni-doping can introduce electrons into
Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2. With more doping, the sign of R_H gradually changes from
positive to negative, while the changing rate of Cu-doped samples is much
faster than that of Ni-doped ones. Combining with the results of
first-principles calculations published previously and the non-monotonic
evolution of the Hall coefficient in the low temperature region, we argue that
when more Cu impurities were introduced into Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2, the removal of
Fermi spectral weight in the hole-like Fermi surfaces is much stronger than
that in the electron-like Fermi surfaces, which is equivalent to significant
electron doping effect. DC magnetization and the lattice constants analysis
reveal that static magnetic moments and notable lattice compression have been
formed in Cu-doped samples. It seems that the superconductivity can be
suppressed by the impurities disregard whether they are magnetic or nonmagnetic
in nature. This gives strong support to a pairing gap with a sign reversal,
like S^\pm. However, the relatively slow suppression rates of T_c show the
robustness of superconductivity of Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 against impurities, implying
that multi-pairing channels may exist in the system.

  Results: Here we provide an algorithm for the efficient calculation of Mutual

directly accessed by a pointer array. The linked list allows efficient storage
of sparse count data caused by protein conservation. The direct access array of
pointers prevents the linked list from being traversed each time it is

An adaptation of the FP algorithm, designated as the empirical centroid
fictitious play (ECFP), is presented. In ECFP players respond to the centroid
of all players' actions rather than track and respond to the individual actions
of every player. Convergence of the ECFP algorithm in terms of average
empirical frequency (a notion made precise in the paper) to a subset of the
Nash equilibria is proven under the assumption that the game is a potential
game with permutation invariant potential function. A more general formulation
of ECFP is then given (which subsumes FP as a special case) and convergence
results are given for the class of potential games. Furthermore, a distributed
formulation of the ECFP algorithm is presented, in which, players endowed with
a (possibly sparse) preassigned communication graph, engage in local,
non-strategic information exchange to eventually agree on a common equilibrium.
Convergence results are proven for the distributed ECFP algorithm.

localization, specifically direction of arrival (DOA), using multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) radar. A sparse localization framework is proposed for a
MIMO array in which transmit and receive elements are placed at random. This
allows for a dramatic reduction in the number of elements needed, while still
attaining performance comparable to that of a filled (Nyquist) array. By
leveraging properties of structured random matrices, we develop a bound on the
coherence of the resulting measurement matrix, and obtain conditions under
which the measurement matrix satisfies the so-called isotropy property. The
coherence and isotropy concepts are used to establish uniform and non-uniform
recovery guarantees within the proposed spatial compressive sensing framework.
In particular, we show that non-uniform recovery is guaranteed if the product
of the number of transmit and receive elements, MN (which is also the number of
degrees of freedom), scales with K(log(G))^2, where K is the number of targets
and G is proportional to the array aperture and determines the angle
resolution. In contrast with a filled virtual MIMO array where the product MN
scales linearly with G, the logarithmic dependence on G in the proposed
framework supports the high-resolution provided by the virtual array aperture
while using a small number of MIMO radar elements. In the numerical results we
show that, in the proposed framework, compressive sensing recovery algorithms
are capable of better performance than classical methods, such as beamforming
and MUSIC.

that aim to solve the hierarchy problem. Scenarios in which the Higgs is a
pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson (NGB) of some new strong dynamics must possess a
number of non-generic features in order to pass the progressively stringent
collider bounds and simultaneously meet our naturalness criteria. Among these
features are the existence of light fermionic partners of the top quark and an
efficient collective breaking of the Nambu-Goldstone symmetry. The top partners
have to be not only parametrically lighter than the other composites, but also
weakly coupled to them in order to suppress unwanted flavor-violating effects.
A Natural pseudo-NGB Higgs model should also be able to fit the LHC Higgs data
without fine-tuning. Among theories with comparable compositeness scales, those
that predict smaller corrections in the Higgs couplings to the standard model
particles are therefore preferred.
  A concrete implementation of these ingredients is discussed in a scenario
based on the coset SU(5)/SO(5). The fit to the current LHC Higgs data is
significantly improved compared to the minimal scenarios, and a fully natural
explanation of both the weak scale and the Higgs boson mass can be attained. An
important role is played by an independent quartic Higgs coupling generated by
UV-sensitive loops involving electroweak doublets mixing with the top partners.
The collider signature of this framework is shown to be rather model-dependent;
in particular, the exotic scalars can alter the phenomenology of the top
partners at a qualitative level.

Sustained accretion of cold gas at high-redshift tends to align BH spins with
the angular momentum of the surrounding gas and maximise their magnitude.
Conversely, at low redshift, as BHs get more massive and galaxies more

increases, especially at the high-mass end, and tends to decrease the magnitude

Swan Blindness cause forecasts to fall short of actual costs. Firstly, optimism
bias has been linked to effects of deception and delusion, which is caused by
taking the inside-view and ignoring distributional information when making
decisions. Secondly, we argued before that Black Swan Blindness makes
decision-makers ignore outlying events even if decisions and judgements are
based on the outside view. Using a sample of 1,471 ICT projects with a total
value of USD 241 billion - we answer the question: Can we show the different
effects of Normal Performance, Delusion, and Deception? We calculated the
cumulative distribution function (CDF) of (actual-forecast)/forecast. Our
results show that the CDF changes at two tipping points - the first one
transforms an exponential function into a Gaussian bell curve. The second
tipping point transforms the bell curve into a power law distribution with the
power of 2. We argue that these results show that project performance up to the
first tipping point is politically motivated and project performance above the
second tipping point indicates that project managers and decision-makers are
fooled by random outliers, because they are blind to thick tails. We then show
that Black Swan ICT projects are a significant source of uncertainty to an

It is suspected to be a binary
because of its high luminosity and its strong X-ray flux, but no periodicity
could be established so far. Here, we present new Xshooter multi-epoch
spectroscopy of R144 obtained at the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT). We detect
variability in position and/or shape of all the spectral lines. We measure
radial velocity variations with an amplitude larger than 250 km/s in NIV and NV
lines. Furthermore, the NIII and NV line Doppler shifts are anti-correlated and
the NIV lines show a double-peaked profile on six of our seven epochs. We thus
conclude that R144 is a double-lined spectroscopic binary. Possible orbital
periods range from 2 to 6 months, although a period up to one year is allowed
if the orbit is highly eccentric. We estimate the spectral types of the
components to be WN5-6h and WN6-7h, respectively. The high luminosity of the
system (log Lbol/Lsun ~ 6.8) suggests a present-day total mass content in the
range of about 200 to 300 Msun, depending on the evolutionary stage of the
components. This makes R144 the most massive binary identified so far, with a
total mass content at birth possibly as large as 400 Msun. We briefly discuss

PRIMAL, the observables of the target system are compared with those of the

the model particles are adjusted to reproduce the observables of the target
system, and the gravitational potential is automatically adjusted by the
changing mass of the particles. This paper builds upon our previous work,
introducing likelihood-based velocity constraints in PRIMAL. In this paper we
apply PRIMAL to barred disc galaxies created by a N-body simulation in a known
dark matter potential, with no error in the observables. This paper
demonstrates that PRIMAL can recover the radial profiles of the surface
density, velocity dispersion in the radial and perpendicular directions, and
the rotational velocity of the target discs, along with the apparent bar
structure and pattern speed of the bar, especially when the reference frame is
adjusted so that the bar angle of the target galaxy is aligned to that of the

distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Here, the dependence of
the distortion on the different types of cosmological initial conditions is
explored, covering adiabatic, baryon/cold dark matter isocurvature, neutrino
density/velocity isocurvature modes and some mixtures. The radiation transfer
functions for each mode are determined and then used to compute the dissipative

distance probability density functions (DPDFs) for 770 objects from the Bolocam
Galactic Plane Survey in the longitude range 7.5 < l < 65. The DPDF formalism
is based on kinematic distances, and uses external data sets to place prior
distance probabilities to resolve the kinematic distance ambiguity (KDA) for
objects in the inner Galaxy. We present priors related to the mid-infrared
absorption of dust in dense molecular regions and the Galactic distribution of
molecular gas. By assuming a numerical model of Galactic mid-infrared emission
and simple radiative transfer, we match the morphology of millimeter thermal
dust emission with mid-infrared absorption to compute a prior DPDF for distance
discrimination. Selecting objects first from (sub-)millimeter source catalogs
avoids a bias towards the darkest infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) and extends the
range of heliocentric distance and contrast range probed by mid-infrared
extinction. We derive well-constrained KDA resolutions for 618 molecular cloud
clumps, with approximately 15% placed at or beyond the tangent distance.
Objects sufficiently dark to be cataloged as IRDCs are generally placed at the
near kinematic distance. Distance comparisons with Galactic Ring Survey KDA
resolutions yield a 92% agreement, and a Galactic face-on view reveals sections
of the Sagittarius and Scutum-Centaurus Arms. This KDA-resolution method for
large catalogs of sources through the combination of (sub-)millimeter and
mid-infrared observations of molecular cloud clumps is generally applicable to
other dust-continuum Galactic plane surveys.

whilst the simulation data is taken from GIMIC. In the simulation, we find that
the dominant peculiar velocities are in the form of large-scale coherent
motions of gas and galaxies. Gravitational infall of galaxies towards one
another is also seen. At smaller scales, the peculiar velocities in the
simulation over-predict the difference between the simulated real- and z-space
galaxy correlation functions. Peculiar velocity pairs separated by <1Mpc/h have
a smaller dispersion and explain the z-space correlation function better. The
Ly{\alpha} auto- and cross-correlation functions in the GIMIC simulation show
infall smaller than implied by previous work. This reduced infall may be due to
the galaxy wide outflows implemented in the simulation. The main challenge in
comparing these simulated results with the observed correlation functions comes
from the presence of velocity errors for the observed LBGs which dominate at
~1Mpc/h scales. When these are taken into account, the observed LBG correlation
function is well matched by a simulated $M_*>10^9M_\odot$ galaxy sample. The
simulated cross-correlation shows similar neutral gas densities around galaxies
as are seen in the observations. The simulated and observed Ly{\alpha} z-space
autocorrelation functions agree well with each other. Our overall conclusion is
that gas and galaxy peculiar velocities are towards the low end of expectation.
Finally, little direct evidence is seen in either simulation or observations
for high transmission near galaxies due to feedback. (Abridged)

stars with masses of ~55,000 M_Sun, however, have been found to explode and
completely disrupt in a supernova (SN) with an energy of up to ~10^55 erg
instead of collapsing to a BH. Such events, ~10,000 times more energetic than
typical SNe today, would be among the biggest explosions in the history of the
universe. Here we present a simulation of such a SN in two stages. Using the
RAGE radiation hydrodynamics code we first evolve the explosion from an early
stage through the breakout of the shock from the surface of the star until the
blast wave has propagated out to several parsecs from the explosion site, which
lies deep within an atomic cooling dark matter (DM) halo at z ~ 15. Then, using
the GADGET cosmological hydrodynamics code we evolve the explosion out to
several kiloparsecs from the explosion site, far into the low-density
intergalactic medium. The host DM halo, with a total mass of 4 x 10^7 M_Sun,
much more massive than typical primordial star-forming halos, is completely
evacuated of high density gas after < 10 Myr, although dense metal-enriched gas
recollapses into the halo, where it will likely form second-generation stars
with metallicities of ~ 0.05 Z_Sun after > 70 Myr. The chemical signature of
supermassive star explosions may be found in such long-lived second-generation

that this surprising phenomenon results from the dephasing due to exponentially
small interaction-induced corrections to the eigenenergies of different states.
For weak interactions, we find that the entanglement entropy grows as \xi ln

localization length. The saturated value of the entanglement entropy at long
times is determined by the participation ratios of the initial state over the

numerical simulations of small systems. Our work shows that the logarithmic

classical information through quantum channels by evaluating the Holevo bound
when the sender and the receiver are in (relativistic) relative motion. By
using the spin degrees of freedom of spin-1/2 fermions to encode the classical
information we show that, for some configurations, the accessible information
in the receiver can be increased when the spin detector moves fast enough. This
is possible by allowing the momentum wave packet of one of the particles to be
wide enough while the momentum wave packets of other particles are kept
relatively narrow. In this way, one can take advantage of the fact that boosts
entangle the spin and momentum degrees of freedom of spin-1/2 fermions to
increase the accessible information in the former. We close the paper with a
discussion of how this relativistic quantum channel cannot in general be
described by completely positive quantum maps.

the {\em basis mismatch} issue when imposing a discrete dictionary on the

nonparametric algorithm, called enhanced matrix completion (EMaC), based on
structured matrix completion. The algorithm starts by arranging the data into a
low-rank enhanced form with multi-fold Hankel structure, then attempts recovery
via nuclear norm minimization. Under mild incoherence conditions, EMaC allows
perfect recovery as soon as the number of samples exceeds the order of
$\mathcal{O}(r\log^{2} n)$. We also show that, in many instances, accurate
completion of a low-rank multi-fold Hankel matrix is possible when the number
of observed entries is proportional to the information theoretical limits
(except for a logarithmic gap). The robustness of EMaC against bounded noise
and its applicability to super resolution are further demonstrated by numerical

a vertically partitioned database containing information about a set of

(statistical) information from the database while protecting the privacy of the
individuals, which we formalize using Differential Privacy. This process can be
facilitated by an untrusted server that provides storage and processing
services but should not learn anything about the database. This work describes
a data release mechanism that employs Post Randomization (PRAM), encryption and
random sampling to maintain privacy, while allowing the authorized party to
conduct an accurate statistical analysis of the data. Encryption ensures that
the storage server obtains no information about the database, while PRAM and
sampling ensures individual privacy is maintained against the authorized party.
We characterize how much the composition of random sampling with PRAM increases
the differential privacy of system compared to using PRAM alone. We also
analyze the statistical utility of our system, by bounding the estimation error
- the expected l2-norm error between the true empirical distribution and the
estimated distribution - as a function of the number of samples, PRAM noise,
and other system parameters. Our analysis shows a tradeoff between increasing
PRAM noise versus decreasing the number of samples to maintain a desired level
of privacy, and we determine the optimal number of samples that balances this
tradeoff and maximizes the utility. In experimental simulations with the UCI
""Adult Data Set"" and with synthetically generated data, we confirm that the
theoretically predicted optimal number of samples indeed achieves close to the
minimal empirical error, and that our analytical error bounds match well with
the empirical results.

candidate rich cluster in the HUDF area of GOODS-South. This brightest cluster
galaxy is the most distant cD galaxy confirmed to date. Ultra-deep HST/WFC3
images reveal an extended envelope starting from ~10 kpc and reaching ~70 kpc
in radius along the semi-major axis. The spectral energy distributions indicate
that both its inner component and outer envelope are composed of an old,
passively-evolving stellar population. The cD galaxy lies on the same mass-size
relation as the bulk of quiescent galaxies at similar redshifts. The cD galaxy
has a higher stellar mass surface density but a similar velocity dispersion to
those of more-massive, nearby cDs. If the cD galaxy is one of the progenitors
of today's more massive cDs, its size and stellar mass have had to increase on
average by factors of $3.4\pm1.1$ and $3.3\pm1.3$ over the past ~8 Gyrs,
respectively. Such increases in size and stellar mass without being accompanied
by significant increases in velocity dispersion are consistent with
evolutionary scenarios driven by both major and minor dry mergers. If such cD
envelopes originate from dry mergers, our discovery of even one example proves
that some BCGs entered the dry merger phase at epochs earlier than z=1. Our
data match theoretical models which predict that the continuance of dry mergers
at z<1 can result in structures similar to those of massive cD galaxies seen
today. Moreover, our discovery is a surprise given that the extreme depth of
the HUDF is essential to reveal such an extended cD envelope at z>1 and, yet,
the HUDF covers only a minuscule region of sky. Adding that cDs are rare, Our
serendipitous discovery hints that such cDs may be more common than expected.

multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Gaussian broadcast channel (BC) with
confidential messages. Secret dirty-paper coding (SDPC) is optimal under an
input covariance constraint, but there is no computable secrecy capacity
expression for the general MIMO case under an average power constraint. In
principle, for this case, the secrecy capacity region could be found through an
exhaustive search over the set of all possible matrix power constraints.
Clearly, this search, coupled with the complexity of dirty-paper encoding and
decoding, motivates the consideration of low complexity linear precoding as an
alternative. We prove that for a two-user MIMO Gaussian BC under an input
covariance constraint, linear precoding is optimal and achieves the same
secrecy rate region as S-DPC if the input covariance constraint satisfies a
specific condition, and we characterize the corresponding optimal linear
precoders. We then use this result to derive a closed-form sub-optimal
algorithm based on linear precoding for an average power constraint. Numerical
results indicate that the secrecy rate region achieved by this algorithm is
close to that obtained by the optimal S-DPC approach with a search over all
suitable input covariance matrices.

bursts (GRBs) dominated by single emission pulses that were observed with the
{\it Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope}. Fitting the prompt radiation of GRBs by
empirical spectral forms such as the Band function leads to ambiguous
conclusions about the physical model for the prompt radiation. Moreover, the
Band function is often inadequate to fit the data. The GRB spectrum is
therefore modeled with two emission components consisting of optically thin
nonthermal synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons and, when
significant, thermal emission from a jet photosphere, which is represented by a
blackbody spectrum. To produce an acceptable fit, the addition of a blackbody
component is required in 5 out of the 8 cases. We also find that the low-energy
spectral index \alpha is consistent with a synchrotron component with \alpha =
-0.81\pm 0.1. This value lies between the limiting values of \alpha = -2/3 and
\alpha = -3/2 for electrons in the slow and fast-cooling regimes, respectively,
suggesting ongoing acceleration at the emission site. The blackbody component
can be more significant when using a physical synchrotron model instead of the
Band function, illustrating that the Band function does not serve as a good
proxy for a nonthermal synchrotron emission component. The temperature and
characteristic emission-region size of the blackbody component are found to,
respectively, decrease and increase as power laws with time during the prompt
phase. In addition, we find that the blackbody and nonthermal components have
separate temporal behaviors.

the location-variant linear filter are function of the p-values of tests which
verify the hypothesis that two samples come from the same distribution and,
therefore, can be used to compute a local mean. The test stems from the family
of (h-phi) divergences which originated in Information Theory. This novel
technique was compared with the Boxcar, Refined Lee and IDAN filters. Image
quality assessment methods on simulated and real data are employed to validate
the performance of this approach. We show that the proposed filter also

reverberation in two Seyfert 1 galaxies, NGC 4593 and Mrk 1511, based on data
from a program carried out at Lick Observatory in Spring 2011. Light curves for
emission lines including H-beta and Fe II were measured by applying a fitting
routine to decompose the spectra into several continuum and emission-line
components, and we use cross-correlation techniques to determine the
reverberation lags of the emission lines relative to V-band light curves. In
both cases the measured lag (t_cen) of Fe II is longer than that of H-beta,
although the inferred lags are somewhat sensitive to the choice of Fe II
template used in the fit. For spectral decompositions done using the Fe II
template of Veron-Cetty et al. (2004), we find t_cen(Fe II)/t_cen(H-beta) =
1.9+-0.6 in NGC 4593 and 1.5+-0.3 in Mrk 1511. The detection of highly
correlated variations between Fe II and continuum emission demonstrates that
the Fe II emission in these galaxies originates in photoionized gas, located

particular, we show that the multiplicity of the alternating representation in
H^i(PvB_n,Q) and H^i(PfB_n,Q) is identical, and moreover is nil for
sufficiently large $n$. We use this to recover the (previously known) fact that
the multiplicity of the alternating representation in H^i(PB_n,Q) is nil (here
PB_n is the ordinary pure braid group). We also give an explicit formula for
H^i(vB_n,Q) and show that H^i(fB_n,Q)=0. Finally, we give Hilbert series for
the character of the action of S_n on H^i(PvB_n,Q) and H^i(PfB_n,Q). An
extension of the standard `Koszul formula' for the graded dimension of Koszul
algebras to graded characters of Koszul algebras then gives Hilbert series for
the graded characters of the respective quadratic dual algebras.

instability that arises when the turbulence shifts from gravitational to
magnetic. We have previously described this instability through a local
analysis at some radius in the disc in terms of a limit cycle. A disc may be
locally unstable over a radial interval. In this paper, we consider how the
local instability model can describe global disc outbursts. The outburst is
triggered near the middle of the range of locally unstable radii. The sudden
increase in turbulence within high surface density material causes a snow
plough of density that propagates both inwards and outwards. All radii inside
of the trigger radius become unstable, as well as locally unstable radii
outside the trigger radius. In addition, a locally stable region outside of the
trigger radius may also become unstable as the gravitational instability is
enhanced by the snow plough. For the circumstellar disc model we consider, we
find that a quarter of the disc mass is accreted on to the central object
during the outburst. The radius out to which the disc is globally unstable is
twice that for which it is locally unstable.

disk in a Be/X-ray binary A 0535+262/V725 Tau from 2009 to 2012, covering two
giant outbursts and several normal outbursts. This monitoring was performed in
order to investigate variabilities of the Be disk due to the interaction with
the neutron star in recent X-ray active phase from 2008 to 2011. Such
variabilities give a clue to uncleared detailed mechanism for very bright X-ray
outbursts, which are unique to some Be/X-ray binaries with relatively wide and
eccentric orbit. In the previous letter (Moritani et al. 2011), a brief
overview of line profile variabilities around the 2009 giant outburst was given
and the possibility of a warped Be disk was discussed. In this paper, a full
analysis of the Halpha line profiles as well as other line profiles is carried
out. A bright blue component, or blue ""shoulder"", showing up after periastron
indicates the presence of a dense gas stream toward the neutron star, which is
associated with observed outbursts. We re-analyze the Halpha line profiles
before 2009 (down to 2005) in order to investigate the variability of the the
disk structure in the innermost region, which seems to have detached from the
Be star surface by 2008. A redshifted enhanced component is remarkable in all
emission lines observed around the 2009 giant outburst, occasionally forming a
triple peak. These features indicate that the Be disk was warped in X-ray
active phase. We estimate the position of the warped region from fitting the
radial velocity of the redshifted enhanced component of Halpha, and find that
it was very close to the periastron when two giant outbursts in 2009 and 2011
and a bright normal outburst in 2010 March occurred. These facts strongly
suggest that the warped Be disk triggered these giant outbursts.

clusters of galaxies selected by mass. Subtle systematic errors in image
reduction can compromise the power of this technique. We use the B-mode signal
to quantify this systematic error and to test methods for reducing this error.
We show that two procedures are efficient in suppressing systematic error in
the B-mode: (1) refinement of the mosaic CCD warping procedure to conform to
absolute celestial coordinates and (2) truncation of the smoothing procedure on
a scale of 10$^{\prime}$. Application of these procedures reduces the
systematic error to 20% of its original amplitude. We provide an analytic
expression for the distribution of the highest peaks in noise maps that can be
used to estimate the fraction of false peaks in the weak lensing $\kappa$-S/N
maps as a function of the detection threshold. Based on this analysis we select
a threshold S/N = 4.56 for identifying an uncontaminated set of weak lensing
peaks in two test fields covering a total area of $\sim 3$deg$^2$. Taken
together these fields contain seven peaks above the threshold. Among these, six
are probable systems of galaxies and one is a superposition. We confirm the
reliability of these peaks with dense redshift surveys, x-ray and imaging
observations. The systematic error reduction procedures we apply are general
and can be applied to future large-area weak lensing surveys. Our high peak
analysis suggests that with a S/N threshold of 4.5, there should be only 2.7
spurious weak lensing peaks even in an area of 1000 deg$^2$ where we expect
$\sim$ 2000 peaks based on our Subaru fields.

Much past work has considered how to compute personalized PageRank from a given

personalized PageRanks to a given target node from all source nodes. This
problem can be interpreted as finding who supports the target or who is
interested in the target.
  We present an efficient algorithm for computing personalized PageRank to a

worst-case. We show that for any graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges, if the

the algorithm will compute a result with $\epsilon$ error in time
$O\left(\frac{1}{\alpha \epsilon} \left(\frac{m}{n} + \log(n)\right)\right)$.
This is much faster than the previously proposed method of computing
personalized PageRank separately from every source node, and it is comparable
to the cost of computing personalized PageRank from a single source. We present
results from experiments on the Twitter graph which show that the constant

electrical conductivity in high-quality and low-disorder two-dimensional (2D)
`metallic' electronic systems such as 2D GaAs electron or hole quantum wells or
gated graphene. Taking into account resistive scattering by Coulomb disorder
arising from quenched random charged impurities in the environment, we show
that the 2D conductivity \sigma(n) varies as \sigma ~ n^{\beta(n)} as a
function of the 2D carrier density n where the exponent \beta(n) is a smooth,
but non-monotonic, function of density with possible nontrivial extrema. In
particular, the density scaling exponent \beta(n) depends qualitatively on
whether the Coulomb disorder arises primarily from remote or background charged
impurities or short-range disorder, and can, in principle, be used to
characterize the nature of the dominant background disorder. A specific
important prediction of the theory is that for resistive scattering by remote
charged impurities, the exponent \beta can reach a value as large as 2.7 for
k_F d ~ 1, where k_F ~\sqrt{n} is the 2D Fermi wave vector and d is the
separation of the remote impurities from the 2D layer. Such an exponent \beta
(>5/2) is surprising because unscreened Coulomb scattering by remote impurities
gives a limiting theoretical scaling exponent of \beta = 5/2, and naively one
would expect \beta(n) \le 5/2 for all densities since unscreened Coulomb
scattering should nominally be the situation bounding the resistive scattering
from above. We find numerically and show theoretically that the maximum value
of \alpha (\beta), the mobility (conductivity) exponent, for 2D semiconductor
quantum wells is around 1.7 (2.7) for all values of d (and for both electrons
and holes) with the maximum \alpha occurring around k_F d ~ 1. We discuss
experimental scenarios for the verification of our theory.

social dynamics in natural systems. Among canids, the dog can show various
levels of social organization due to the influence of humans on their lives.
Though the dog is known as man's best friend and has been studied extensively
as a pet, studies on the natural history, ecology and behaviour of dogs in a
natural habitat are rare. Here we report results of an extensive
population-level study conducted through one-time censuses in urban India to
understand the ecoethology of free-ranging dogs. We built a model to test if
the observed groups could have been formed through random associations while
foraging. Our modeling results suggest that the dogs, like all efficient
scavengers, tend to forage singly but also form random uncorrelated groups. A
closer inspection of the group compositions however reveals that the foraging
associations are non-random events. The tendency of adults to associate with
the opposite sex in the mating season and of juveniles to stay close to adults
in the non-mating season drives the population towards aggregation, in spite of
the apparently random nature of the group size distribution. Hence we conclude
that to be or not to be social is a matter of choice for the free-ranging dogs,
and not a matter of chance.

However, at the single neuron level, the neuronal membrane, the dendritic arbor

Active dendritic branchlets enable the propagation of dendritic spikes, whose
computational functions, despite several proposals, remain an open question.
Here we propose a concrete function to the active channels in large dendritic
trees. By using a probabilistic cellular automaton approach, we model the
input-output response of large active dendritic arbors subjected to complex
spatio-temporal inputs and exhibiting non-stereotyped dendritic spikes. We find
that, if dendritic spikes have a non-deterministic duration, the dendritic
arbor can undergo a continuous phase transition from a quiescent to an active
state, thereby exhibiting spontaneous and self-sustained localized activity as
suggested by experiments. Analogously to the critical brain hypothesis, which
states that neuronal networks self-organize near a phase transition to take
advantage of specific properties of the critical state, here we propose that
neurons with large dendritic arbors optimize their capacity to distinguish
incoming stimuli at the critical state. We suggest that ""computation at the
edge of a phase transition"" is more compatible with the view that dendritic
arbors perform an analog rather than a digital dendritic computation.

of a slowly rotating accretion flow from sub-pc to pc scales under the
irradiation from the central AGN. Compared to previous work, we improve the
calculation of the radiative force due to X-rays. More importantly, in addition
to radiative pressure and radiative heating/cooling directly from the central
AGN, in the momentum equation we also include the force due to the scattered
and reprocessed photons. We find that the accretion flow properties change
significantly due to this ""re-radiation"" effect. The inflow rate at the inner
boundary is reduced, while the outflow rate at the outer boundary is enhanced
by about one order of magnitude. This effect is more significant when the
density at the outer boundary is higher. The properties of outflows such as
velocity, momentum and energy fluxes, and the ratio of outflow rate and the
accretion rate, are calculated. We find that the efficiency of transferring the
radiation power into the kinetic power of outflow is typically $10^{-3}$, far
below the value of $\sim 0.05$ which is assumed in some cosmological
simulations. The effect of the temperature of the gas at the outer boundary
($T_0$) is investigated. When $T_0$ is high, the emitted luminosity of the
accretion flow oscillates. This is because in this case the gas around the
Bondi radius can be more easily heated to be above the virial temperature due
to its high internal energy. Another question we hope to address is the
so-called ""sub-Eddington"" puzzle. Observationally, the luminosity of almost all
AGNs are sub-Eddington, while theoretically the luminosity of an accretion flow
can easily be super-Eddington. We find that even when the re-radiation effect
is included and outflow does become much stronger, the luminosity, while
reduced, can still be super-Eddington.

the assumption that trading of the underlying asset does not affect the price
of that asset. This assumption can be fulfilled only in perfectly liquid
markets. Since most markets are illquid, this assumption might be too
restrictive. Thus, taking into account the price impact in option pricing is an
important issue. This issue has been dealt with, to some extent, for illiquid
markets by assuming a continuous process, mainly based on the Brownian motion.
However, the recent financial crisis and its effects on the global stock
markets have propagated the urgent need for more realistic models where the
stochastic process describing the price trajectories involves random jumps.
Nonetheless, works related to markets with jumps are scant compared to the
continuous ones. In addition, these previous studies do not deal with illiquid
markets. The contribution of this paper is to tackle the pricing problem for
options in illiquid markets with jumps as well as the hedging strategy within
this context, which is the first of its kind to the best knowledge.

relaying. We start with a Cognitive Interference Channel (CIC) where one of the
transmitters (non-cognitive) has knowledge of a rank-1 linear combination of
the two information messages, while the other transmitter (cognitive) has
access to a rank-2 linear combination of the same messages. This is referred to
as the Network-Coded CIC, since such linear combination may be the result of
some random linear network coding scheme implemented in the backbone wired
network. For such channel we develop an achievable region based on a few novel
concepts: Precoded Compute and Forward (PCoF) with Channel Integer Alignment
(CIA), combined with standard Dirty-Paper Coding. We also develop a capacity
region outer bound and find the sum symmetric GDoF of the Network-Coded CIC.
Through the GDoF characterization, we show that knowing ""mixed data"" (linear
combinations of the information messages) provides an unbounded spectral
efficiency gain over the classical CIC counterpart, if the ratio of SNR to INR
is larger than certain threshold. Then, we consider a Gaussian relay network
having the two-user MIMO IC as the main building block. We use PCoF with CIA to
convert the MIMO IC into a deterministic finite-field IC. Then, we use a linear
precoding scheme over the finite-field to eliminate interference in the
finite-field domain. Using this unified approach, we characterize the symmetric
sum rate of the two-user MIMO IC with coordination, cognition, and two-hops. We
also provide finite-SNR results which show that the proposed coding schemes are
competitive against state of the art interference avoidance based on orthogonal
access, for Rayleigh fading channels.

investigated. Voltage pulses arising from a BC501A organic liquid scintillation
detector in a mixed radiation field have been recorded with a fast digital
sampling oscilloscope. The performances of most pulse shape discrimination
methods in scintillation detection systems using time-domain features of the
pulses are affected intensively by noise. However, the WTMM method using
frequency-domain features exhibits a strong insensitivity to noise and can be
used to discriminate neutron and {\gamma}-ray events based on their different
asymptotic decay trend between the positive modulus maximum curve and the
negative modulus maximum curve in the scale-space plane. This technique has
been verified by the corresponding mixed-field data assessed by the
time-of-flight (TOF) method and the frequency gradient analysis (FGA) method.
It is shown that the characterization of neutron and gamma achieved by the
discrimination method based on WTMM is consistent with that afforded by TOF and
better than FGA. Moreover, because the WTMM method is it self presented to
eliminate the noise, there is no need to make any pretreatment for the pulses.

formation models. We show here that, while the hot CGM of galaxies formed in
the simulations is metal poor in a mass-weighted sense, its X-ray
luminosity-weighted metallicity is often close to solar. This bias arises
because the soft X-ray emissivity of a typical 0.1 keV corona is dominated by
collisionally-excited metal ions that are synthesised in stars and recycled
into the hot CGM. We find that these metals are ejected primarily by stars that
form in-situ to the main progenitor of the galaxy, rather than in satellites or
external galaxies. The enrichment of the hot CGM therefore proceeds in an
inside-out fashion throughout the assembly of the galaxy: metals are
transported from the central galaxy by SNe-driven winds and convection over
several gigayears, establishing a strong negative radial metallicity gradient.
Whilst metal ions synthesised by stars are necessary to produce the X-ray
emissivity that enables the hot CGM of isolated galaxies to be detected, the
electrons that collisionally excite them are equally important. Since our
simulations indicate that the electron density of hot coronae is dominated by
the metal-poor gas accreted from the IGM, we infer that the hot CGM observed
via X-ray emission is the outcome of both hierarchical accretion and stellar
recycling.

networks strongly depends on the network topology. In particular, the so-called
algebraic connectivity $\mu_{N-1}$, or the smallest non-zero eigenvalue of the
discrete Laplacian operator plays a crucial role on synchronization, graph
partitioning, and network robustness. In our study, synchronization is placed
in the general context of networks-of-networks, where single network models are
replaced by a more realistic hierarchy of interdependent networks. The present
work shows, analytically and numerically, how the algebraic connectivity
experiences sharp transitions after the addition of sufficient links among
interdependent networks.

of jet rapidity. The systematic uncertainties on the ratios are significantly
reduced due to the cancellation of correlated uncertainties in the two
measurements. Results are compared to the prediction from next-to-leading order
perturbative QCD calculations corrected for non-perturbative effects, and
next-to-leading order Monte Carlo simulation. Furthermore, the ATLAS jet

structures of biological tissues, particularly in reconstructing fiber tracts

(DTs) estimated from diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data usually contain
systematic bias, which subsequently biases the diffusivity measurements
popularly adopted in fiber tracking algorithms. On the other hand, correctly
accounting for the spatial information is important in the construction of
these diffusivity measurements since the fiber tracts are typically spatially
structured. This paper aims to establish test-based approaches to identify
anisotropic water diffusion areas in the human brain. These areas in turn
indicate the areas passed by fiber tracts. Our proposed test statistic not only
takes into account the bias components in eigenvalue estimates, but also
incorporates the spatial information of neighboring voxels. Under mild
regularity conditions, we demonstrate that the proposed test statistic
asymptotically follows a $\chi^2$ distribution under the null hypothesis.
Simulation and real DTI data examples are provided to illustrate the efficacy
of our proposed methods.

limit of stochastic susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) epidemic dynamics on a

asymptotic exponential growth phase of such epidemics, showing how the higher

fully, meaning that the skewness of the degree distribution affects the
variance of the prevalence of infection. We compare these asymptotic results to

  EW10844",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reversible control of surface wettability has wide applications in
lab-on-chip systems, tunable optical lenses, and microfluidic tools. Using a
graphene sheet as a sample material and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, we
demonstrate that strain engineering can serve as an effective way to control
the surface wettability. The contact angles $\theta$ of water droplets on a
graphene vary from 72.5$^\circ$ to 106$^\circ$ under biaxial strains ranging
from -10% to 10% that are applied on the graphene layer. For an intrinsic
hydrophilic surface (at zero strain), the variation of $\theta$ upon the
applied strains is more sensitive, i.e., from 0$^\circ$ to 74.8$^\circ$.
Overall the cosines of the contact angles exhibit a linear relation with
respect to the strains. In light of the inherent dependence of the contact
angle on liquid-solid interfacial energy, we develop an analytic model to show
the $\cos \theta$ as a linear function of the adsorption energy $E_{ads}$ of a
single water molecule over the substrate surface. This model agrees with our MD
results very well. Together with the linear dependence of $E_{ads}$ on biaxial
strains, we can thus understand the effect of strains on the surface
wettability. Thanks to the ease of reversibly applying mechanical strains in
micro/nano-electromechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS), we believe that strain
engineering can be a promising means to achieve the reversibly control of
surface wettability.

that allows transmission at rate $R$ with an error probability not exceeding

This question was addressed by Strassen as well as Polyanskiy, Poor and Verdu,

  Polar codes are optimal in the sense that they achieve capacity. In this
paper, we are asking to what degree they are also optimal in terms of their
finite-length behavior. Our approach is based on analyzing the dynamics of the
un-polarized channels. The main results of this paper can be summarized as
follows. Consider the sum of Bhattacharyya parameters of sub-channels chosen
(by the polar coding scheme) to transmit information. If we require this sum to
be smaller than a given value $P_{\rm e}>0$, then the required block-length $N$
scales in terms of the rate $R < I(W)$ as $N \geq

constant that depends on $P_{\rm e}$ and $I(W)$, and $\underline{\mu} = 3.579$.
Also, we show that with the same requirement on the sum of Bhattacharyya
parameters, the block-length scales in terms of the rate like $N \leq
\frac{\beta}{(I(W)-R)^{\overline{\mu}}}$, where $\beta$ is a constant that
depends on $P_{\rm e}$ and $I(W)$, and $\overline{\mu}=6$.

verifies the first law of thermodynamics for the apparent horizon with a volume

function of correlation functions needs to be known. Usually, it is
approximated as a multivariate Gaussian, though this is not necessarily a good
approximation.
  Aims. We show how to calculate a better approximation for the probability
distribution of correlation functions, which we call ""quasi-Gaussian"".
  Methods. Using the exact univariate PDF as well as constraints on correlation
functions previously derived, we transform the correlation functions to an
unconstrained variable for which the Gaussian approximation is well justified.
From this Gaussian in the transformed space, we obtain the quasi-Gaussian PDF.
The two approximations for the probability distributions are compared to the
""true"" distribution as obtained from simulations. Additionally, we test how the
new approximation performs when used as likelihood in a toy-model Bayesian
analysis.
  Results. The quasi-Gaussian PDF agrees very well with the PDF obtained from
simulations; in particular, it provides a significantly better description than
a straightforward copula approach. In a simple toy-model likelihood analysis,
it yields noticeably different results than the Gaussian likelihood, indicating
its possible impact on cosmological parameter estimation.

data that extends the classical multivariate concept to situations where the
observed data are points belonging to curves generated by a stochastic process.
More precisely, a new semi-distance for functional observations that generalize
the usual Mahalanobis distance for multivariate datasets is introduced. For
that, the development uses a regularized square root inverse operator in
Hilbert spaces. Some of the main characteristics of the functional Mahalanobis
semi-distance are shown. Afterwards, new versions of several well known
functional classification procedures are developed using the Mahalanobis
distance for functional data as a measure of proximity between functional
observations. The performance of several well known functional classification
procedures are compared with those methods used in conjunction with the
Mahalanobis distance for functional data, with positive results, through a
Monte Carlo study and the analysis of two real data examples.

clearly shows different molecular distributions between large nitrogen- (e.g.,
C2H5CN) and oxygen-bearing (e.g., HCOOCH3) molecules. However, acetone
(CH3)2CO, a special complex O-bearing molecule, has been shown to have a very
different distribution from other typical O-bearing molecules in the BN/KL
region. We searched for acetone within our IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer
3 mm and 1.3 mm data sets. Twenty-two acetone lines were searched within these
data sets. The angular resolution ranged from 1.8 X 0.8 to 6.0 X 2.3 arcsec^2,
and the spectral resolution ranged from 0.4 to 1.9 km s-1. Nine of the acetone
lines appear free of contamination. Three main acetone peaks (Ace-1, 2, and 3)
are identified in Orion BN/KL. The new acetone source Ace-3 and the extended
emission in the north of the hot core region have been found for the first
time. An excitation temperature of about 150 K is determined toward Ace-1 and
Ace-2, and the acetone column density is estimated to be 2-4 X 10^16 cm-2 with
a relative abundance of 1-6 X 10^-8 toward these two peaks. Acetone is a few
times less abundant toward the hot core and Ace-3 compared with Ace-1 and
Ace-2.
  We find that the overall distribution of acetone in BN/KL is similar to that
of N-bearing molecules, e.g., NH3 and C2H5CN, and very different from those of
large O-bearing molecules, e.g., HCOOCH3 and (CH3)2O. Our findings show the
acetone distribution is more extended than in previous studies and does not
originate only in those areas where both N-bearing and O-bearing species are
present. Moreover, because the N-bearing molecules may be associated with
shocked gas in Orion BN/KL, this suggests that the formation and/or destruction
of acetone may involve ammonia or large N-bearing molecules in a shocked-gas
environment.

sets where each entry corresponds to a particular participant to be protected.
In many situations, a user may pose a relational algebra query on a sensitive
database, and desires differentially private aggregation on the result of the
query. However, no known work is capable to release this kind of aggregation
when the query contains unrestricted join operations. This severely limits the
applications of existing differential privacy techniques because many data
analysis tasks require unrestricted joins. One example is subgraph counting on
a graph. Existing methods for differentially private subgraph counting address
only edge differential privacy and are subject to very simple subgraphs. Before
this work, whether any nontrivial graph statistics can be released with
reasonable accuracy under node differential privacy is still an open problem.
  In this paper, we propose a novel differentially private mechanism to release
an approximation to a linear statistic of the result of some positive
relational algebra calculation over a sensitive database. Unrestricted joins
are supported in our mechanism. The error bound of the approximate answer is
roughly proportional to the \emph{empirical sensitivity} of the query --- a new
notion that measures the maximum possible change to the query answer when a
participant withdraws its data from the sensitive database. For subgraph
counting, our mechanism provides the first solution to achieve node
differential privacy, for any kind of subgraphs.

been increasingly explored for their roles in the etiology of complex diseases.
This is part of a concerted effort to find the ""missing heritability.""
Accordingly, statistical methods have been proposed to detect imprinting and
maternal effects simultaneously based on either a case-parent triads design or
a case-mother/control-mother pairs design. However, existing methods are
full-likelihood based and have to make strong assumptions concerning mating
type probabilities (nuisance parameters) to avoid overparametrization. In this
paper we propose to augment the two popular study designs by combining them and
including control-parent triads, so that our sample may contain a mixture of
case-parent/control-parent triads and case-mother/control-mother pairs. By
matching the case families with control families of the same structure and
stratifying according to the familial genotypes, we are able to derive a
partial likelihood that is free of the nuisance parameters. This renders
unnecessary any unrealistic assumptions and leads to a robust procedure without
sacrificing power. Our simulation study demonstrates that our partial
likelihood method has correct type I error rate, little bias and reasonable
power under a variety of settings.

drastically within one year, implying a significant change in the velocity
field in the atmosphere. Our modeling suggests an outer atmosphere (MOLsphere)
extending to 1.2--1.4 stellar radii with CO column densities of
(0.5--1)x10^{20} cm^{-2} and a temperature of ~2000 K. While the velocity field
in 2009 is characterized by strong upwelling motions at 20--30 km/s, it changed
to strong downdrafts in 2010. On the other hand, the AMBER data in the
continuum show only a slight deviation from limb-darkened disks and only
marginal time variations. We derive a limb-darkened disk diameter of
37.38+/-0.06 mas and a power-law-type limb-darkening parameter of

a mass of 15+/-5 Msun with an age of 11-15 Myr. This age is consistent with the
recently estimated age for the Upper Scorpius OB association. The properties of
the outer atmosphere of Antares are similar to those of another well-studied
red supergiant, Betelgeuse. The density of the extended outer atmosphere of

high-dimensional highly dependent data are available but no or little feedback
is provided to the learner, which makes any inference rather challenging. To
address this challenge, we formulate the following problem. Given a series of
observations $X_0,\dots,X_n$ coming from a large (high-dimensional) space
$\mathcal X$, find a representation function $f$ mapping $\mathcal X$ to a
finite space $\mathcal Y$ such that the series $f(X_0),\dots,f(X_n)$ preserves
as much information as possible about the original time-series dependence in
$X_0,\dots,X_n$. We show that, for stationary time series, the function $f$ can
be selected as the one maximizing a certain information criterion that we call
time-series information. Some properties of this functions are investigated,
including its uniqueness and consistency of its empirical estimates.
  Implications for the problem of optimal control are presented.

unstructured Lagrangian-type one-step WENO finite volume scheme for the
solution of hyperbolic partial differential equations with non-conservative
products. The method achieves high order of accuracy in space together with
essentially non-oscillatory behavior using a nonlinear WENO reconstruction
operator on unstructured triangular meshes. High order accuracy in time is
obtained via a local Lagrangian space-time Galerkin predictor method that
evolves the spatial reconstruction polynomials in time within each element. The
final one-step finite volume scheme is derived by integration over a moving
space-time control volume, where the non-conservative products are treated by a
path-conservative approach that defines the jump terms on the element
boundaries. The entire method is formulated as an Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian
(ALE) method, where the mesh velocity can be chosen independently of the fluid
velocity.
  The new scheme is applied to the full seven-equation Baer-Nunziato model of
compressible multi-phase flows in two space dimensions. The use of a Lagrangian
approach allows an excellent resolution of the solid contact and the resolution
of jumps in the volume fraction. The high order of accuracy of the scheme in
space and time is confirmed via a numerical convergence study. Finally, the
proposed method is also applied to a reduced version of the compressible
Baer-Nunziato model for the simulation of free surface water waves in moving
domains. In particular, the phenomenon of sloshing is studied in a moving water
tank and comparisons with experimental data are provided.

Because of the short lifetimes of these stars the metals produced in their

with a different initial mass function and different SEDs were formed, already
much earlier than the time at which the universe became completely reionized at
a redshift of z~6. Using a state-of-the-art model atmosphere code we calculate
realistic SEDs of very massive stars (VMSs) of different metallicities to serve
as input for the 3-dimensional multi-frequency radiative transfer code we have
developed to simulate the temporal evolution of the ionization of the
inhomogeneous interstellar and intergalactic medium, using multiple stellar
clusters as sources of ionizing radiation. Our tool handles distributions of
numerous radiative sources characterized by high resolution synthetic SEDs, and
yields occupation numbers of the required energy levels of the most important
elements which are treated in NLTE consistently with the 3d radiative transfer.
We further demonstrate that the increasing metallicity of the radiative sources
in the transition from PopIII stars to PopII stars has a strong impact on the
hardness of the emitted spectrum, and hence on the reionization history of
helium. A top-heavy stellar mass distribution characterized by VMSs forming in
chemically evolved clusters of high core mass density may not only provide the
progenitors of intermediate-mass and supermassive black holes (SMBHs), but also
play an important role for the reionization of HeII. The number of VMSs
required to reionize HeII by a redshift of z~2.5 is astonishingly close to the
number of VMSs required to explain galactic SMBHs if one assumes that these

non-perturbative approximation that treats on equal footing the normal and
anomalous density condensates. The mean-field solutions in LOAF correspond to
first-order and second-order phase transition solutions with two critical
temperatures corresponding to a vanishing Bose-Einstein condensate, $T_c$, and
a vanishing diatom condensate, $T^\star$. The \emph{second-order} phase
transition solution predicts the correct order of the transition in continuum
Bose gases. For either solution, the superfluid state is tied to the presence
of the diatom condensate related to the anomalous density in the system. In
ultracold Bose atomic gases confined on a three-dimensional lattice, the
critical temperature $T_c$ exhibits a quantum phase transition, where $T_c$
goes to zero at a finite coupling. The BH phase diagram in LOAF features a line
of first-order transitions ending in a critical point beyond which the
transition is second order while approaching the quantum phase transition. We
identify a region where a diatom condensate is expected for temperatures higher

In our work we demonstrate that there is another critical value for $u$.
Actually, if $u$ does not exceed a certain value $u_{c2}$, which depends on
$L$, the current-voltage characteristic exhibits the step-like behaviour.
However, for $u>u_{c2}$ it becomes hysteretic. In this case, with increase of
$j$ the steady state, which corresponds to the time independent distribution of
the order parameter along the channel, losses its stability at switching
current value $j_{sw}$, and time periodic oscillations of both the order
parameter and electric filed occur in the channel. As $j$ sweeps down, the
periodic dynamics ceases at certain retrapping current value $j_r<j_{sw}$.
Shunting the channel by a resistor increases the value of $j_r$, while $j_{sw}$
remains unchanged. Thus, for some high enough conductivity of the shunt $j_r$
and $j_{sw}$ eventually coincide, and the hysteretic loop disappears. We reveal
dynamical regimes involved in the hysteresis, and discuss the bifurcation
transitions between them.

curvature tensors of the time hypersurfaces in unitary gauge, i.e. choosing as
time slicing the uniform scalar field hypersurfaces. Focusing on linear
perturbations, we identify seven Lagrangian operators that lead to equations of
motion containing at most two (space or time) derivatives, the background
evolution being determined by the time dependent coefficients of only three of
these operators. We then establish a dictionary that translates any existing or

Galileon-theories and show that they can be described, up to linear order, by
only six of the seven operators mentioned above. This implies, remarkably, that
the dynamics of linear perturbations can be more general than that of Horndeski
while remaining second order. Finally, in order to make the link with
observations, we provide the entire set of linear perturbation equations in
Newtonian gauge, the effective Newton constant in the quasi-static
approximation and the ratio of the two gravitational potentials, in terms of
the time-dependent coefficients of our Lagrangian.

prognosis data on multiple subtypes of the same cancer are analyzed. An AFT
(accelerated failure time) model is adopted to describe survival. The genetic
basis of multiple subtypes is described using the heterogeneity model, which
allows a gene/SNP to be associated with the prognosis of some subtypes but not
the others. A compound penalization approach is developed to conduct gene-level

prognosis. The proposed approach has an intuitive formulation and can be

first focus on regular one dimensional rings in the microcanonical ensemble.
For $\gamma<1.5$ the model behaves like short-range one and no phase transition
occurs. For $\gamma>1.5$, the system equilibrium properties are found to be
identical to the mean field, which displays a second order phase transition at
a critical energy density $\varepsilon=E/N, \varepsilon_{c}=0.75$. Moreover for
$\gamma_{c}\simeq1.5$ we find that a non trivial state emerges, characterized
by an infinite susceptibility. We then consider small world networks, using the
Watts-Strogatz mechanism on the regular networks parametrized by $\gamma$. We
first analyze the topology and find that the small world regime appears for
rewiring probabilities which scale as $p_{SW}\propto1/N^{\gamma}$. Then
considering the XY-rotors model on these networks, we find that a second order
phase transition occurs at a critical energy $\varepsilon_{c}$ which
logarithmically depends on the topological parameters $p$ and $\gamma$. We also
define a critical probability $p_{MF}$, corresponding to the probability beyond

population at equilibrium is of relevance for many applications in population
and quantitative genetics. Several recursion formulae have been proposed during
the last decades, whose derivations mostly contain heuristic parts and
therefore remain mathematically questionable. We propose a more justifiable
approach, including an alternative recursion formula for the expected LD. Since
the exact formula depends on the distribution of allele frequencies in a very
complicated manner, we suggest an approximate solution and analyze its validity
extensively in a simulation study. Compared to the widely used formula of Sved,
the proposed formula performs better for all parameter constellations
considered. We then analyze the expected LD at equilibrium using the theory on
discrete-time Markov chains based on the linear recursion formula, with
equilibrium being defined as the steady-state of the chain, which finally leads
to a formula for the effective population size N_e. An additional analysis
considers the effect of non-exactness of a recursion formula on the
steady-state, demonstrating that the resulting error in expected LD can be
substantial. In an application to the HapMap data of two human populations we
illustrate the dependency of the N_e-estimate on the distribution of minor
allele frequencies (MAFs), showing that the estimated N_e can vary by up to 30%
when a uniform instead of a skewed distribution of MAFs is taken as a basis to
select SNPs for the analyses. Our analyses provide new insights into the
mathematical complexity of the problem studied.

historically large gamma-ray opacity values at 500 GeV, extending beyond tau=4

tau=5 for high-levels. The majority of the z=0.6035 absorption-corrected VHE

VERITAS point is the only point showing agreement with this extrapolation,
possibly implying the overestimation of the gamma-ray opacity or the onset of
an unexpected VHE spectral feature. A curved log parabola is favored when
fitting the full range of gamma-ray data (0.5 to 500 GeV). While fitting the
absorption-corrected VHE data alone results in a harder differential power law
than that from the full range, the indices derived using three EBL models are
consistent with the physically motivated limit set by Fermi acceleration

package for exploring all forms of human genetic variation. Unlike existing
tools, GEMINI integrates genetic variation with a diverse and flexible set of
genome annotations (e.g., dbSNP, ENCODE, UCSC, ClinVar, KEGG) into a unified
database to facilitate interpretation and data exploration. Whereas other
methods provide an inflexible set of variant filters or variant prioritization
methods, GEMINI allows researchers to compose complex queries based on sample
genotypes, inheritance patterns, and both pre-installed and custom genome
annotations. GEMINI also provides methods for ad hoc queries and data
exploration, a simple programming interface for custom analyses that leverage
the underlying database, and both command line and graphical tools for common
analyses. We demonstrate the utility of GEMINI for exploring variation in
personal genomes and family based genetic studies, and illustrate its ability
to scale to studies involving thousands of human samples. GEMINI is designed
for reproducibility and flexibility and our goal is to will provide researchers
with a standard framework for medical genomics.

amount of dose in a short period of time. In SBRT the dose is delivered using
open fields (e.g., beam's-eye-view) known as ""apertures"". Mathematical methods
can be used for optimizing treatment planning for delivery of sufficient dose
to the cancerous cells while keeping the dose to surrounding organs at risk
(OARs) minimal. Two important elements of a treatment plan are quality and
delivery time. Quality of a plan is measured based on the target coverage and
dose to OARs. Delivery time heavily depends on the number of beams used in the
plan since the setup times for different beam directions constitute a large
portion of the delivery time. Therefore the ideal plan, in which all potential
beams can be used simultaneously, will be associated with a long impractical
delivery time. We use the dose to OARs in the ideal plan to find the plan with
the minimum number of beams which is guaranteed to be epsilon-optimal (i.e., a
predetermined maximum deviation from the ideal plan is guaranteed). Since the
treatment plan optimization is inherently a multicriteria optimization problem,
the planner can navigate the ideal dose distribution Pareto surface and select
a plan of desired target coverage versus OARs sparing, and then use the
proposed technique to reduce the number of beams while guaranteeing
epsilon-optimality. We use mixed integer programming (MIP) for optimization. To
reduce the computation time for the resultant MIP, we use two heuristics: a
beam elimination scheme and a family of heuristic cuts, known as ""neighbor
cuts"", based on the concept of ""adjacent beams"". We show the effectiveness of
the proposed solution technique on two clinical cases, a liver and a lung case.
Based on our technique we propose an algorithm for fast generation of
epsilon-optimal plans.

'colour or atom' by infinitely many, using blurs to represent the resulting
term algebra, but the blurs are not enough to blur the structure of the finite
structure in the complex algebra. Then, the latter cannot be representable due
to a {finite- infinite} contradiction. This structure can be a finite clique in
a graph or a finite relation algebra or a finite cylindric algebra. This theme
gives examples of weakly representable atom structures that are not strongly
representable. Many constructions existing in the literature are placed in a
rigorous way in such a framework, properly defined.
  This is the essence too of construction of Monk like-algebras, one constructs
graphs with finite colouring (finitely many blurs), converging to one with
infinitely many, so that the original algebra is also blurred at the complex
algebra level, and the term algebra is completey representable, yielding a
representation of its completion the complex algebra.
  A reverse of this process exists in the literature, it builds algebras with
infinite blurs converging to one with finite blurs. This idea due to Hirsch and
Hodkinson, uses probabilistic methods of Erdos to construct a sequence of
graphs with infinite chromatic number one that is 2 colourable. This
construction, which works for both relation and cylindric algebras, further
shows that the class of strongly representable atom structures is not
elementary.

generalization is defined by adding certain relations to the algebra of braids
and ties. A specialization of this last algebra corresponds to one small
Ramified Partition algebra, this fact is the motivation for the name of our
generalization.

to quantum gravity is that of the Hamiltonian constraint. We investigate said
problem in the context of formal geometric quantization. We study the
implications of the non uniqueness in the choice of the vector field which
satisfies the presymplectic equation for the Hamiltonian constraint, and study
the implication of the same in the quantization of the theory. Our aim is to
show that this non uniqueness in the choice of said vector field, which really
stems from refoliation invariance leads to a very ambiguous notion of quantum
evolution. We then investigate the case of a theory where the problem of the
Hamiltonian constraint has been dealt with at the classical level, namely Shape
Dynamics, and attempt to derive a time dependent Schrodinger equation for the
quantum dynamics of this theory.

theory for circularly symmetric electric field. The electromagnetic field is
considered with an angular component given by $% F_{\mu \nu }=E_{0}\delta_{\mu
}^{t}\delta_{\nu }^{\theta }$ for $E_{0}=$ constant. First, we show that the
metric for zero cosmological constant and the Power-Maxwell Lagrangian of the
form of $\sqrt{\left\vert F_{\mu \nu }F^{\mu \nu }\right\vert }$, coincides
with the solution given in $2+1-$% dimensional gravity coupled with a massless,
self interacting real scalar field. With the same Lagrangian and a non-zero
cosmological constant we obtain a non-asymptotically flat wormhole solution in
$2+1-$dimensions. The confining motions of massive charged and chargeless
particles are investigated too. Secondly, another interesting solution is given
for zero cosmological constant together with conformal invariant condition. The
formation of timelike naked singularity for this particular case is
investigated within the framework of the quantum mechanics. Quantum fields
obeying the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations are used to probe the singularity
and test the quantum mechanical status of the singularity.

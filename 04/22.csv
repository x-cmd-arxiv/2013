DC electric fields. We show that AC fields produce equally remarkable patterns
in a radially symmetric set-up. The character of the pattern depends crucially
on the field strength. A significant feature observed is the bending of radial
cracks, with the curvature increasing as field strength is increased. Fields of
20 to 70 V have been applied and several features of the resulting patterns

  Sequence-based Tracking","25 pages, 9 figures",,,,"q-bio.QM cond-mat.mes-hall stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Applications, ranging from tracking molecular motion within cells to
analyzing complex animal foraging behavior, require algorithms for associating
a collection of spot-like particles in one image with particles contained in
another image. These associations are often made via network flow algorithms.
However, it is often the case that many candidate association solutions (the
output of network flow algorithms) have nearly optimal scores; in this case,
the optimal assignment solution is of dubious quality. Algorithms for reliably
computing the uncertainty of candidate association solutions are
under-developed in situations where many particles are tracked over multiple
frames of data. This is due in part to the fact that exact uncertainty
quantification (UQ) in large association problems is computationally
intractable because the exact computation exhibits exponential dependence on
the number of particles tracked. We introduce a technique that can accurately
and efficiently quantify association ambiguity (i.e., UQ for discrete
association problems) without requiring the evaluation of the cost of each
feasible association solution. Our method can readily be wrapped around
existing tracking algorithms and can efficiently handle a variety of 2D
association problems. The applications presented are focused on tracking
molecules in live cells. Our method is validated via both simulations and
experiments. The experimental applications aim to accurately form tracks and
quantify diffusion of quantum dot labeled proteins from \emph{in vivo}
measurements; here association problems involving cost matrices possessing
hundreds to thousands of rows/columns are encountered. For such large-scale
problems, we discuss how our approach can efficiently and accurately quantify
inherent uncertainty in candidate data associations.

spherical t-designs"" and ""Relative t-designs in binary Hamming association
schemes vs. combinatorial t-designs"". In this paper, we want to prove how much
we can develop a similar theory in the latter situation, imitating the theory
in the former one. We first prove that the weight function is constant on each
shell for tight relative t-designs on p shells on a wide class of Q-polynomial
association schemes, including Hamming association schemes. In the theory of
Euclidean t-designs on 2 concentric spheres (shells), it is known that the
structure of coherent configurations is naturally attached. However, it seems
difficult to prove this claim in a general context. In the case of tight
2-designs in combinatorial 2-designs, there are great many tight 2-designs,
i.e., symmetric 2-designs, while there are very few tight 2e-designs for e no
less than 2. So, as a starting point, we concentrate our study to the existence
problem of tight relative 2-designs, in particular on 2 shells, in binary
Hamming association schemes H(n,2). We prove that every tight relative
2-designs on 2 shells in H(n,2) has the structure of coherent configuration. We
determined all the possible parameters of coherent configurations attached to
such tight relative 2-designs for n at most 30. Moreover for each of them we
determined whether there exists such a tight relative 2-design or not, either
by constructing them from symmetric 2-designs or Hadamard matrices, or
theoretically showing the non-existence. In particular, we show that for n
congruent to 6 (mod 8), there exist such tight relative 2-designs whose weight
functions are not constant. These are the first examples of those with
non-constant weight.

able to simulate the latent Markov model according to its prior distribution.
Their methodology relies on an approximation of the score vector for general
statistical models based upon an artificial posterior distribution and bypasses
the calculation of any derivative. We show here that this score estimator can
be derived from a simple application of Stein's lemma and how an additional
application of this lemma provides an original derivative-free estimator of the
observed information matrix. We establish that these estimators exhibit
robustness properties compared to finite difference estimators while their bias
and variance scale as well as finite difference type estimators, including
simultaneous perturbations (see e.g. Spall, IEEE Trans. on Automatic Control
37), with respect to the dimension of the parameter. For state-space models
where sequential Monte Carlo computation is required, these estimators can be
further improved. In this specific context, we derive original derivative-free
estimators of the score vector and observed information matrix which are
computed using sequential Monte Carlo approximations of smoothed additive
functionals associated with a modified version of the original state-space
model.

representations for knots. The generalization involves a study of the quantum
moduli space of special Lagrangian branes with higher Betti numbers probing the
Calabi-Yau. This leads to an extension of SYZ, and a new notion of mirror
symmetry, involving higher dimensional mirrors. The mirror theory is a
topological string, related to D-modules, which we call the ""D-model."" In the
present setting, the mirror manifold is the augmentation variety of the link.
Connecting further to contact geometry, we study intersection properties of
branches of the augmentation variety guided by the relation to D-modules. This
study leads us to propose concrete geometric constructions of Lagrangian
fillings for links. We also relate the augmentation variety with the large N
limit of the colored HOMFLY, which we conjecture to be related to a
Q-deformation of the extension of A-polynomials associated with the link
complement.

of pairings depends on the non-degeneracy of some universal bilinear map,

high frequency phenomena dominate. Since the work of Lord Rayleigh in 1892, low
frequency (or quasi-static) behaviour has been neatly encapsulated in effective
anisotropic media. However such classical homogenization theories break down in
the high-frequency or stop band regime.
  Higher frequency phenomena are of significant importance in photonics
(transverse magnetic waves propagating in infinite conducting parallel fibers),
phononics (anti-plane shear waves propagating in isotropic elastic materials
with inclusions), and platonics (flexural waves propagating in thin-elastic
plates with holes). Fortunately, the recently proposed high-frequency
homogenization (HFH) theory is only constrained by the knowledge of standing
waves in order to asymptotically reconstruct dispersion curves and associated
Floquet-Bloch eigenfields: It is capable of accurately representing
zero-frequency stop band structures. The homogenized equations are partial
differential equations with a dispersive anisotropic homogenized tensor that
characterizes the effective medium.
  We apply HFH to metamaterials, exploiting the subtle features of Bloch
dispersion curves such as Dirac-like cones, as well as zero and negative group
velocity near stop bands in order to achieve exciting physical phenomena such
as cloaking, lensing and endoscope effects. These are simulated numerically
using finite elements and compared to predictions from HFH. An extension of HFH
to periodic supercells enabling complete reconstruction of dispersion curves
through an unfolding technique is also introduced.

that their mutual distance remains constant. Using a model for the van der
Waals dispersion interaction based on the interaction between the instantaneous
atomic dipole moments, which are induced and correlated by the zero-point field
fluctuations, we evaluate the interaction energy between the two accelerating
atoms in terms of quantities expressed in the laboratory reference frame. We
find that the dependence of the van der Waals interaction between the atoms
from the distance is different with respect to the case of atoms at rest, and
the relation of our results with the Unruh effect is discussed. We show that in
the near zone a new term proportional to $R^{-5}$ adds to the usual $R^{-6}$
behavior, and in the far zone a term proportional to $R^{-6}$ adds to the usual
$R^{-7}$ behavior, making the interaction of a longer range. We also find that
the interaction energy is time-dependent, and the physical meaning of this
result is discussed. In particular, we find acceleration-dependent corrections
to the $R^{-7}$ (far zone) and $R^{-6}$ (near zone) proportional to
$a^2t^2/c^2$; this suggests that significant changes to the van der Waals
interaction between the atoms could be obtained if sufficiently long times are
taken, without necessity of the extremely high accelerations required by other

proves that the information theoretic cut-set upper bound to the capacity can

reducing the previously known gap. Further improved gap results are presented
for more structured networks like diamond networks. It is then shown that the
generalized Degrees-of-Freedom of a general Gaussian half-duplex relay network
is the solution of a linear program, where the coefficients of the linear
inequality constraints are proved to be the solution of several linear
programs, known in graph theory as the assignment problem, for which efficient

the 2^N possible transmit-receive configurations/states for the relays, is
investigated and known results for diamond networks are extended to general

results show that, for a general N-relay network with N<9, the optimal schedule
has at most N +1 states with strictly positive probability. As an extension of
a conjecture presented for diamond networks, it is conjectured that this result
holds for any HD relay network and any number of relays. Finally, a 2-relay

Recent measurements indicate that a weak magnetic field may be present even in
the smooth low density intergalactic medium. One explanation for these
observations is that a seed magnetic field was generated by some unknown
mechanism early in the life of the Universe, and was later amplified by various
dynamos in nonlinear objects like galaxies and clusters. We show that a
primordial magnetic field is expected to be generated in the early Universe on
purely linear scales through vorticity induced by scale-dependent temperature
fluctuations or equivalently, a spatially varying speed of sound of the gas.
Residual free electrons left over after recombination tap into this vorticity
to generate magnetic field via the Biermann battery process. Although the
battery operates even in the absence of any relative velocity between dark
matter and gas at the time of recombination, the presence of such a relative
velocity modifies the predicted spatial power spectrum of the magnetic field.
At redshifts of order a few tens, we estimate a root mean square field strength
of order 1e-25 -1e-24 G on comoving scales~10 kpc. This field, which is
generated purely from linear perturbations, is expected to be amplified
significantly after reionization, and to be further boosted by dynamo processes

deployment and an efficient resource utilization.
  This paper investigates the security implications of such an architecture. We
consider a simple model where an attacker seeks to extract secret information

present a general framework that exploits basic properties of the VNet

pulsar phenomena, including intensity nulling, pulse-shape mode changes,
subpulse drift rates, spindown rates, and X-ray emission, based on the
typically broad and monotonic distributions of state lifetimes. Markovianity
implies a nonlinear magnetospheric system in which state changes occur
stochastically, corresponding to transitions between local minima in an
effective potential. State durations (though not transition times) are thus
largely decoupled from the characteristic time scales of various magnetospheric
processes. Dyadic states are common but some objects show at least four states
with some transitions forbidden. Another case is the long-term intermittent
pulsar B1931+24 that has binary radio-emission and torque states with wide, but
non-monotonic duration distributions. It also shows a quasi-period of $38\pm5$
days in a 13-yr time sequence, suggesting stochastic resonance in a Markov
system with a forcing function that could be strictly periodic or
quasi-periodic. Nonlinear phenomena are associated with time-dependent activity
in the acceleration region near each magnetic polar cap. The polar-cap diode is
altered by feedback from the outer magnetosphere and by return currents from an
equatorial disk that may also cause the neutron star to episodically charge and
discharge. Orbital perturbations in the disk provide a natural periodicity for
the forcing function in the stochastic resonance interpretation of B1931+24.
Disk dynamics may introduce additional time scales in observed phenomena.
Future work can test the Markov interpretation, identify which pulsar types
have a propensity for state changes, and clarify the role of selection effects.

$\lbol\approx(0.5-3)\times10^{43}$ \lum\ and $\lratio\approx0.02-0.15$. A

accounts for $\sim$60% of the total light in the $R$ band. The extended disk is
featureless, but the central $\sim150-400$ pc contains a conspicuous semi-ring
of bright, blue star-forming knots, whose integrated ultraviolet luminosity

afterglow flux was already decaying; these bursts can provide useful lower
limits on Gamma. Combining all analyzed bursts in our sample, we find that the
previously reported correlation between Gamma and the burst luminosity L_gamma
does not hold. However, the data clearly shows a lower bound Gamma_min which
increases with L_gamma. We suggest an explanation for this feature: explosions
with large jet luminosities and Gamma < Gamma_min suffer strong adiabatic
cooling before their radiation is released at the photosphere; they produce
weak bursts, barely detectable with present instruments. To test this
explanation we examine the effect of adiabatic cooling on the GRB location in
the L_gamma - Gamma plane using a Monte Carlo simulation of the GRB population.
Our results predict detectable on-axis ""orphan"" afterglows. We also derive
upper limits on the density of the ambient medium that decelerates the
explosion ejecta. We find that the density in many cases is smaller than
expected for stellar winds from normal Wolf-Rayet progenitors. The burst
progenitors may be peculiar massive stars with weaker winds or there might
exist a mechanism that reduces the stellar wind a few years before the
explosion.

into the cavity, the master equation for the cavity-mirror system is derived by
following the general reservoir theory based on the density operator in which
the reservoir variables are adiabatically eliminated by using the reduced
density operator for the system in the interaction picture. When the mirror is
weakly coupled to the cavity mode, we find that under the conditions of laser
cooling to the ground state, the driven cavity field can effectively perform as
a squeezed vacuum reservoir for the movable mirror via utilizing the completely
destructive interference of quantum noise, and thus the efficient transfer of
squeezing from the light to the movable mirror occurs, which is irrespective of
the ratio between the cavity damping rate and the mechanical frequency. When
the mirror is moderately coupled to the cavity mode, the photonic excitation
can preclude the completely destructive interference of quantum noise, and as a
consequence, the mirror deviates from the ideal squeezed state.

amplitude rather than of a probability density. There may be reasons why
dynamics of a physical system are described by amplitude. In order to
investigate one role of the probability amplitude in quantum mechanics,
specialized codeword-transfer experiments are designed using classical
information theory. Within this context, quantum mechanics based on probability
amplitude provides the following: i) a minimum error of the codeword transfer;
ii) this error is independent of coding parameters; and iii) nontrivial and
nonlocal correlation can be realized. These are considered essential advantages
of the probability amplitude over the probability density.

discover spectrum opportunities for the Secondary Users (SUs). The quality of
spectrum sensing is evaluated by both sensing accuracy and sensing efficiency.
Here, sensing accuracy is represented by the false alarm probability and the
detection probability while sensing efficiency is represented by the sensing
overhead and network throughput. In this paper, we propose a group-based
cooperative Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol called GC-MAC, which addresses
the tradeoff between sensing accuracy and efficiency. In GC-MAC, the
cooperative SUs are grouped into several teams. During a sensing period, each
team senses a different channel while SUs in the same team perform the joint
detection on the targeted channel. The sensing process will not stop unless an
available channel is discovered. To reduce the sensing overhead, an
SU-selecting algorithm is presented to selectively choose the cooperative SUs
based on the channel dynamics and usage patterns. Then, an analytical model is
built to study the sensing accuracy-efficiency tradeoff under two types of
channel conditions: time-invariant channel and time-varying channel. An
optimization problem that maximizes achievable throughput is formulated to
optimize the important design parameters. Both saturation and non-saturation
situations are investigated with respect to throughput and sensing overhead.
Simulation results indicate that the proposed protocol is able to significantly
decrease sensing overhead and increase network throughput with guaranteed
sensing accuracy.

breast which are thought to precede most invasive breast cancers (IBC). As
individual DCIS lesions are initiated, grow and invade (i.e. become IBC) the
size distribution of the DCIS lesions present in a given human population will
evolve. We derive a differential equation governing this evolution and show,
for given assumptions about growth and invasion, that there is a unique
distribution which does not vary with time. Further, we show that any initial
distribution converges to this stationary distribution exponentially quickly.
It is therefore reasonable to assume that the stationary distribution is equal
to the true DCIS size distribution, at least for human populations which are
relatively stable with respect to the determinants of breast cancer. Based on
this assumption and the size data of 110 DCIS lesions detected in a
mammographic screening program between 1993 and 2000, we produce maximum
likelihood estimates for certain growth and invasion parameters. Assuming that
DCIS size is proportional to a positive power $p$ of the time since tumour
initiation we estimate $p$ to be 0.50 with a 95% confidence interval of $(0.35,
0.71)$. Therefore we estimate that DCIS lesions follow a square-root growth law
and hence that they grow rapidly when small and relatively slowly when large.
Our approach and results should be useful for other mathematical studies of
cancer, especially those investigating biological mechanisms of invasion.

increases the high-SNR secrecy sum-rate for $1<\beta<2$. Our proposed precoder
achieves a per-user secrecy rate which has the same high-SNR scaling factor as
both the following upper bounds: (i) the rate of the optimum RCI precoder
without secrecy requirements, and (ii) the secrecy capacity of a single-user
system without interference. Furthermore, we obtain a deterministic

presence of channel state information (CSI) error. We also analyze the
performance of our proposed RCI-PR precoder with CSI error, and we determine
how the error must scale with the SNR in order to maintain a given rate gap to

  The afterglow of GRB 100621A shows a very complex temporal as well as

spectacular one causing a sudden intensity jump about one hour after the prompt
emission. The spectrum of this component is much steeper than the canonical

into a narrow jet seems to provide an adequate description. Another noteworthy
result is the large ($A_V$ = 3.6 mag) line-of-sight host extinction of the

plan for surveys using extreme-AO systems on the next generation of 30-meter

imaging: planets orbit their stars. Under the parameters of current surveys,
orbital motion is negligible over the duration of a typical observation.
However, this motion is not negligible when using large diameter telescopes to
observe at relatively close stellar distances (1-10pc), over the long exposure
times (10-20 hrs) necessary for direct detection of older planets in the HZ. We
show that this motion will limit our achievable signal-to-noise ratio and
degrade observational completeness. Even on current 8m class telescopes,
orbital motion will need to be accounted for in an attempt to detect HZ planets
around the nearest sun-like stars alpha Cen A & B, a binary system now known to
harbor at least one planet. Here we derive some basic tools for analyzing this
problem, and ultimately show that the prospects are good for de-orbiting a
series of shorter exposures to correct for orbital motion.

  massive star clusters","18 pages, 13 figures. Accepted by ApJ",,"10.1088/0004-637X/776/2/112",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The double or extended main-sequence turnoffs (MSTOs) in the color-magnitude
diagram (CMD) of intermediate-age massive star clusters in the Large Magellanic
Cloud are generally interpreted as age spreads of a few hundred Myr. However,
such age spreads do not exist in younger clusters (i.e., 40-300 Myr), which
challenges this interpretation. The effects of rotation on the MSTOs of star
clusters have been studied in previous works, but the results obtained are
conflicting. Compared with previous works, we consider the effects of rotation
on the MS lifetime of stars. Our calculations show that rotating models have a
fainter and redder MSTO with respect to non-rotating counterparts with ages
between about 0.8 and 2.2 Gyr, but have a brighter and bluer MSTO when age is
larger than 2.4 Gyr. The spread of the MSTO caused by a typical rotation rate
is equivalent to the effect of an age spread of about 200 Myr. Rotation could
lead to the double or extended MSTOs in the CMD of the star clusters with ages
between about 0.8 and 2.2 Gyr. However, the extension is not significant; and
it does not even exist in younger clusters. If the efficiency of the mixing
were high enough, the effects of the mixing would counteract the effect of the
centrifugal support in the late stage of evolution; and the rotationally
induced extension would disappear in the old intermediate-age star clusters;
but younger clusters would have an extended MSTO. Moreover, the effects of
rotation might aid in understanding the formation of some ""multiple
populations"" in globular clusters.

case of unbalanced trees, w = 0. Under models of neutral evolution, for

Indeed, imbalance can be a signature of permanent selection pressure, such as

several statistical invariants although it is drastically reduced in size

we study here some basic combinatorial properties of Omega-trees. We focus on
the distribution of the number of subtrees with two leaves. We show that

the low-energy non-Drude peak and unusual midinfrared band. However, the
position of the midinfrared band shifts towards to the low-energy non-Drude
peak with increasing doping. In particular, the low-energy non-Drude peak
incorporates with the midinfrared band in the heavily overdoped regime, and
then the low-energy Drude behavior recovers. It is shown that the striking
behavior of the low-energy non-Drude peak and unusual midinfrared band in the
underdoped and optimally doped regimes is closely related to the emergence of
the doping and temperature dependence of the normal-state pseudogap.

  Unbalanced Linguistic Term sets",,"Kybernetika, 2013",,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the domain of Computing with words (CW), fuzzy linguistic approaches are
known to be relevant in many decision-making problems. Indeed, they allow us to
model the human reasoning in replacing words, assessments, preferences,
choices, wishes... by ad hoc variables, such as fuzzy sets or more
sophisticated variables.
  This paper focuses on a particular model: Herrera & Martinez' 2-tuple
linguistic model and their approach to deal with unbalanced linguistic term
sets. It is interesting since the computations are accomplished without loss of
information while the results of the decision-making processes always refer to
the initial linguistic term set. They propose a fuzzy partition which
distributes data on the axis by using linguistic hierarchies to manage the
non-uniformity. However, the required input (especially the density around the
terms) taken by their fuzzy partition algorithm may be considered as too much
demanding in a real-world application, since density is not always easy to
determine. Moreover, in some limit cases (especially when two terms are very
closed semantically to each other), the partition doesn't comply with the data
themselves, it isn't close to the reality. Therefore we propose to modify the
required input, in order to offer a simpler and more faithful partition. We
have added an extension to the package jFuzzyLogic and to the corresponding
script language FCL. This extension supports both 2-tuple models: Herrera &
Martinez' and ours. In addition to the partition algorithm, we present two
aggregation algorithms: the arithmetic means and the addition. We also discuss
these kinds of 2-tuple models.

Data Bank, but the driving force and structures that allow for protein
functions have not been elucidated at the atomic level for even one protein. We
have been able to clarify that the inter-subunit hydrophobic interaction
driving the electrostatic opening of the pore in aquaporin 0 (AQP0). Aquaporins
are membrane channels for water and small non-ionic solutes found in animals,
plants, and microbes. The structures of aquaporins have high homology and
consist of homotetramers, each monomer of which has one pore for a water
channel. Each pore has two narrow portions: one is the narrowest constriction
region consisting of aromatic residues and an arginine (ar/R), and another is
two asparagine-proline-alanine (NPA) homolog portions. Here we show that an
inter-subunit hydrophobic interaction in AQP0 drives a stick portion consisting
of four amino acids toward the pore and the tip of the stick portion,
consisting of a nitrogen atom, opens the pore: that movement is the swing
mechanism (this http URL). The energetics and conformational change of amino
acids participating in the swing mechanism confirm this view. The swing
mechanism in which inter-subunit hydrophobic interactions in the tetramer drive
the on-off switching of the pore explains why aquaporins consist of tetramers.
Here, we report that experimental and molecular dynamics findings using various
mutants support this view of the swing mechanism. The finding that mutants of
amino acids in AQP2 corresponding to the stick of the swing mechanism cause
severe recessive nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) demonstrates the critical
role of the swing mechanism for the aquaporin function. We report first that
the inter-subunit hydrophobic interaction in aquaporin 0 drives the
electrostatic opening of the aquaporin pore at the atomic level.

contribution from other reaction channels cannot be neglected, unsaturated
hydrocarbons easily break their multiple C-C bonds to form CO after their
interactions with atomic oxygen. Here we present an upgraded chemical modelling
including a revision of the reactions between oxygen atoms and small
unsaturated hydrocarbons for different astrochemical environments. A first
conclusion is that towards hot cores/corinos atomic oxygen easily degrades
unsaturated hydrocarbons directly to CO or to its precursor species (such as
HCCO or HCO) and destroys the double or triple bond of alkenes and alkynes.
Therefore, environments rich in atomic oxygen at a relatively high temperature
are not expected to be rich in large unsaturated hydrocarbons or polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons. On the contrary, in O-poor and C-rich objects,
hydrocarbon growth can occur to a large extent. In addition, new radical
species, namely ketyl and vinoxy radicals, generated from other reaction
channels can influence the abundances of hydrocarbons towards hot cores. We,
therefore, suggest they should be included in the available databases.
Hydrocarbon column densities are calculated in the 10(13)-10(15) cm(-2) range,
in good agreement with their observed values, despite the small number of data
currently published in the literature.

theoretical ideas from the abstract world of geometrical forms to the concrete
experimental realm of condensed matter physics. The basis for this ---
variously known as holography, the AdS/CFT correspondence or gauge-gravity
duality --comes from notions right at the cutting edge of string theory.
Nevertheless, the insights afforded can often be expressed in ways very
familiar to condensed matter physicists, such as relationships between response
functions and new sum rules.
  The aim of this short, introductory review is to survey the ideas
underpinning this crossover, in a way that -- as far as possible -- strips them
of sophisticated mathematical formalism, whilst at the same time retaining
their fundamental essence. I will sketch the areas in which progress has been
made to date and highlight where the challenges and open questions lie.
Finally, I will attempt to give a perspective upon these ideas. What

generation mechanism, in the Landau gauge, for the case of a small number of
quark families. As in earlier considerations, we assume that the main bulk of
the unquenching corrections to the gluon propagator originates from the fully
dressed quark-loop diagram. The nonperturbative evaluation of this diagram
provides the key relation that expresses the unquenched gluon propagator as a
deviation from its quenched counterpart. This relation is subsequently coupled
to the integral equation that controls the momentum evolution of the effective
gluon mass, which contains a single adjustable parameter; this constitutes a
major improvement compared to the analysis presented in Phys. Rev. D86 (2012)
014032, where the behaviour of the gluon propagator in the deep infrared was
estimated through numerical extrapolation. The resulting nonlinear system is
then treated numerically, yielding unique solutions for the modified gluon mass
and the quenched gluon propagator, which fully confirm the picture put forth
recently in several continuum and lattice studies. In particular, an infrared
finite gluon propagator emerges, whose saturation point is considerably
suppressed, due to a corresponding increase in the value of the gluon mass.
This characteristic feature becomes more pronounced as the number of active
quark families increases, and can be deduced from the infrared structure of the
kernel entering in the gluon mass equation.

writing predicates for querying the resulting state-space of the Petri net, a
connection between the formalized model and a higher-level description of the

for validating such descriptions. Thanks to the independent nature among tasks
related to different business services, represented by restrictions in the

are discussed, pointing the gain in expressiveness of business rules and the

the impact of inter-cell disturbance due to pilot reuse (so-called pilot
contamination), we are concerned with the computational complexity. The
conventional minimum mean square error (MMSE) and minimum variance unbiased
(MVU) channel estimators rely on inverting covariance matrices, which has cubic
complexity in the multiplication of number of antennas at each side. Since this
is extremely expensive when there are hundreds of antennas, we propose to
approximate the inversion by an L-order matrix polynomial. A set of
low-complexity Bayesian channel estimators, coined Polynomial ExpAnsion CHannel
(PEACH) estimators, are introduced. The coefficients of the polynomials are
optimized to yield small mean square error (MSE). We show numerically that
near-optimal performance is achieved with low polynomial orders. In practice,
the order L can be selected to balance between complexity and MSE.
Interestingly, pilot contamination is beneficial to the PEACH estimators in the
sense that smaller L can be used to achieve near-optimal MSEs.

the conditional variance of y given x is approximately constant in x (again,

for most $\beta$'s, provided only that the dimension of Z is large. In that
sense, we see that most linear submodels of a high-dimensional overall model

methods available to study splicing from short RNA-Seq data. We group the
methods according to the different questions they address: 1) Assignment of the
sequencing reads to their likely gene of origin. This is addressed by methods
that map reads to the genome and/or to the available gene annotations. 2)
Recovering the sequence of splicing events and isoforms. This is addressed by
transcript reconstruction and de novo assembly methods. 3) Quantification of
events and isoforms. Either after reconstructing transcripts or using an
annotation, many methods estimate the expression level or the relative usage of
isoforms and/or events. 4) Providing an isoform or event view of differential
splicing or expression. These include methods that compare relative
event/isoform abundance or isoform expression across two or more conditions. 5)
Visualizing splicing regulation. Various tools facilitate the visualization of
the RNA-Seq data in the context of alternative splicing. In this review, we do
not describe the specific mathematical models behind each method. Our aim is
rather to provide an overview that could serve as an entry point for users who

exact current-density relation in the bulk for unidirectional hopping. An
approach based on time-dependent density functional theory provides a good
description of the kinetics. For open systems, the system-reservoir couplings
are shown to have a striking influence on boundary-induced phase diagrams. The
role of particle-hole symmetry is discussed and its consequence on the topology
of the phase diagrams. It is furthermore demonstrated that systems with weak
bias can be mapped onto systems with unidirectional hopping.

self-similarity cannot simultaneously occur with strict associativity -- i.e.
no monoid may have a strictly associative (semi-)monoidal tensor, although many
monoids have a semi-monoidal tensor associative up to isomorphism. We then give
a simple coherence result for the arrows exhibiting self-similarity and use
this to describe a `strictification procedure' that gives a semi-monoidal
equivalence of categories relating strict and non-strict self-similarity, and
hence monoid analogues of many categorical properties. Using this, we
characterise a large class of diagrams (built from the canonical isomorphisms

self-similarity) that are guaranteed to commute.

including high $T_C$ superconductivity and topological quantum computing. In
this work we show that these systems can be realized starting from directed
polymers braided together to form a nontrivial link configuration belonging to
the topological class of plats. The statistical sum of a such plat is related
here to the partition function of a two-component anyon gas. The constraints
that preserve the topological configuration of the plat are imposed on the
polymer trajectories using the so-called Gauss linking number, a topological
invariant that has already been well studied in polymer physics. Due to these
constraints, short-range forces act on the monomers or, equivalently, on the
anyon quasiparticles in a way that closely resembles the appearance of reaction
forces in the constrained systems of classical mechanics. If the polymers are
homogeneous, the anyon system reaches a self-dual point, in which these forces
vanish exactly. A class of self-dual solutions that minimize the energy of the
anyons is derived. The two anyon gas discussed here obeys an abelian
statistics, while for quantum computing it is known that nonabelian anyons are
necessary. However, this is a limitation due to the use of the Gauss linking
invariant to impose the topological constraints, which is a poor topological
invariant and is thus unable to capture the nonabelian characteristics of the
braided polymer chains. A more refined treatment of the topological constraints
would require more sophisticated topological invariants, but so far their
application to the statistical mechanics of linked polymers is an open problem.

null conditioned on the data, where the null is a simplification undertaken to
counter the intractability of the more complex model, that the simpler null
model is nested within. With the more complex model rendered intractable, the
null model uses a simplifying assumption that capacitates the learning of an
unknown parameter vector given the data. Bayes factors are shown to be known
only up to a ratio of unknown data-dependent constants--a problem that cannot
be cured using prescriptions similar to those suggested to solve the problem
caused to Bayes factor computation, by non-informative priors. Thus, a new test
is needed in which we can circumvent Bayes factor computation. In this test, we
undertake generation of data from the model in which the null hypothesis is
true and can achieve support in the measured data for the null by comparing the
marginalised posterior of the model parameter given the measured data, to that
given such generated data. However, such a ratio of marginalised posteriors can
confound interpretation of comparison of support in one measured data for a
null, with that in another data set for a different null. Given an application
in which such comparison is undertaken, we alternatively define support in a
measured data set for a null by identifying the model parameters that are less
consistent with the measured data than is minimally possible given the
generated data, and realising that the higher the number of such parameter
values, less is the support in the measured data for the null. Then, the
probability of the null conditional on the data is given within an MCMC-based

for $M$-sextics, along the line of Riemann's Nachlass 1857 and a simple
Harnack-style argument (1876). Our proof seems to have escaped the attention of
Hilbert (and all subsequent workers) [but alas turned out to contain a severe
gap, cf. Introduction for more!]. It uses a bit Poincar\'e's index formula
(1881/85). The method applies as well to prohibit Rohn's scheme 10/1, and
therefore all obstructions of Hilbert's 16th in degree $m=6$ can be explained
via the method of total reality. (The same ubiquity of the method is
conjectured in all degrees, and then suspected to offer new insights.) More
factually, a very simple and robust phenomenon of total reality on $M$-curves
of even order is described (the odd-order case being already settled in Gabard
2013), and it is speculated that this could be used as an attack upon the
(still open) Ragsdale conjecture for $M$-curves (positing that $| \chi|\le
k^2$). Of course a giant gap still remains to be bridged in case the latter
conjecture is true at all. Alas, the writer has little experimental evidence
for the truth of the conjecture, and the game can be a hazardous one. However
we suspect that the method of total reality should at least be capable of
recovering the weaker Petrovskii bound, or strengthened variants due to Arnold
1971. This text has therefore merely didactic character and offers no
revolutionary results, but tries to reactivate a very ancient method (due
basically to Riemann 1857) whose swing seems to have been somewhat
underestimated, at least outside of the conformal-mapping community.

Here we show that in metal-filament based memristive devices the switching can
be fully stochastic. While individual switching events are random, the
distribution and probability of switching can be well predicted and controlled.
Rather than trying to force high switching probabilities using excessive
voltage or time, the inherent stochastic nature of resistive switching allows
these binary devices to be used as building blocks for novel error-tolerant
computing schemes such as stochastic computing and provide a needed ""analog""
feature in neuromorphic applications. To verify such potential, we demonstrated
memristor-based stochastic bitstreams in both time and space domains, and show
that an array of binary memristors can act as a multi-level ""analog"" device for

sensor nodes. An important application of WSNs is in the field of real-time
communication. Real-time communication is a critical service which requires a
qualitative routing protocol for energy-efficient network communication. The
judicious use of energy of the network nodes is essential and important for
sustainability and longevity of a WSN. This paper proposes an algorithm namely
Priority-Energy Based Data Forwarding Algorithm(PEDF) which empowers the node
to choose the most suitable packet forwarding path, based on the priority of
the packet and the current energy status of the forwarding node. The algorithm
hence dynamically adapts to the prevailing energy-scenario of the network and
takes routing decisions accordingly, based on packet priority. Minimizing
delay, minimizing energy utilization, maximizing throughput and maximizing
network lifetime are the key elements of the proposed algorithm.

protocols, targeting different aspects of the awareness requirements in
wireless sensor networks. Under such a unified framework, we pay special
attention to the most important awareness issues in wireless sensor networks:
namely dynamic awareness, energy awareness and spatiotemporal awareness. First,
we propose the spatiotemporal aware routing protocol for wireless sensor
networks, which maintains a constant delivery speed for soft real-time
communication. Second, we introduce the time-energy aware aggregation scheme,
which increases the degree of aggregation and reduces energy consumption
without jeopardizing the end-to-end delay. It is the data aggregation scheme to
take the timely delivery of messages as well as protocol overhead into account
to adjust aggregation strategies adaptively in accordance with assessed traffic
conditions and expected wireless sensor network requirements. Third, we also
deal with dynamic awareness by proposing a new communication category based on
a lazy-binding concept. The evaluation of this integrated architecture
demonstrates its performance composability and its capability to be tailored
for applications with different awareness requirements. We believe that the
integrated architecture, supporting various kinds of awareness requirements,
lays a foundation for overall wireless sensor network.

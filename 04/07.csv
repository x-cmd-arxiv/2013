constraint with an amplify-and-forward (AF) cooperation strategy. In the
proposed adaptive DSTC scheme, an adjustable code matrix obtained by a feedback
channel is employed to transform the space-time coded matrix at the relay node.
The effects of the limited feedback and the feedback errors are assessed.
Linear MMSE expressions are devised to compute the parameters of the adjustable
code matrix and the linear receive filters. Stochastic gradient (SG) and
least-squares (LS) algorithms are also developed with reduced computational
complexity. An upper bound on the pairwise error probability analysis is
derived and indicates the advantage of employing the adjustable code matrices
at the relay nodes. An alternative optimization algorithm for the adaptive DSTC
scheme is also derived in order to eliminate the need for the feedback. The
algorithm provides a fully distributed scheme for the adaptive DSTC at the

NP}_{\mathbb{R}}$-complete in the Blum-Shub-Smale model of computation. The
current algorithms (probabilistic or deterministic) for computing the real
dimension have complexity $(s \, D)^{O(d(n-d))}$, that becomes $(s \,
D)^{O(n^2)}$ in the worst-case. The existence of a probabilistic or
deterministic algorithm for computing the real dimension with single
exponential complexity with a factor better than ${O(n^2)}$ in the exponent in
the worst-case, is a longstanding open problem. We provide a positive answer to
this problem by introducing a probabilistic algorithm for computing the real
dimension of a semi-algebraic set with complexity $(s\, D)^{O(n)}$.

to model acoustic propagation. This paper describes four new results in the
theory of Gaussian beams. (1) A new version of the \v{C}erven\'y equations for
the amplitude and phase of Gaussian beams is developed by applying the
equivalence of Hamilton-Jacobi theory with Jacobi's equation that connects
Riemannian curvature to geodesic flow. Thus the paper makes a fundamental
connection between Gaussian beams and an acoustic channel's so-called intrinsic
Gaussian curvature from differential geometry. (2) A new formula
$\pi(c/c"")^{1/2}$ for the distance between convergence zones is derived and
applied to several well-known profiles. (3) A class of ""model spaces"" are
introduced that connect the acoustics of ducting/divergence zones with the
channel's Gaussian curvature $K=cc""-(c')^2$. The ""model"" SSPs yield constant
Gaussian curvature in which the geometry of ducts corresponds to great circles
on a sphere and convergence zones correspond to antipodes. The distance between
caustics $\pi(c/c"")^{1/2}$ is equated with an ideal hyperbolic cosine SSP duct.
(4) An ""intrinsic"" version of \v{C}erven\'y's formulae for the amplitude and
phase of Gaussian beams is derived that does not depend on an ""extrinsic""
arbitrary choice of coordinates such as range and depth. Direct comparisons are
made between the computational frameworks used by the three different
approaches to Gaussian beams: Snell's law, the extrinsic Frenet-Serret
formulae, and the intrinsic Jacobi methods presented here. The relationship of
Gaussian beams to Riemannian curvature is explained with an overview of the
modern covariant geometric methods that provide a general framework for
application to other special cases.

a perturbation expansion for the motion of the particle in the presence of

expansion for the motion along the collective unstable normal mode of the

the average energy loss to the bath. Increasing the bath temperature will
reduce the average energy loss. In this paper, we analyse this effect, using a
novel perturbation theory. We find that within the MM approach, the thermal
energy gained from the bath diverges, the average energy gain becomes infinite,
implying an essential failure of the theory. Within the PGH approach increasing
the bath temperature reduces the average energy loss but only by a finite small
amount, of the order of the inverse of the reduced barrier height. This then
does not seriously affect the theory. Analysis and application for a cubic

of one B-DNA coil with 10 base pairs. This parameter-free density functional
theory (DFT) study illustrates the initial step in a proposed vdW-DF
computational strategy for large biomolecular problems. The strategy is to
first perform a survey of interaction geometries, based on the evaluation of
the van der Waals (vdW) attraction, and then limit the evaluation of the
remaining DFT parts (specifically the expensive study of the kinetic-energy
repulsion) to the thus identified interesting geometries. Possibilities for
accelerating this second step is detailed in a separate study. For the B-DNA
dimer, the variation in van der Waals attraction is explored at relatively
short distances (although beyond the region of density overlap) for a 360
degrees rotation. This study highlights the role of the structural motifs, like
the grooves, in enhancing or reducing the vdW interaction strength. We find
that to a first approximation, it is possible to compare the DNA double strand
at large wall-to-wall separations to the cylindrical shape of a carbon nanotube
(which is almost isotropic under rotation). We compare our first-principles
results with the atom-based dispersive interaction predicted by DFT-D2 [J.
Comp. Chem. 27, 1787 (2006)] and find agreement in the asymptotic region.
However, we also find that the differences in the enhancement that occur at
shorter distances reveal characteristic features that result from the fact that
the vdW-DF method is an electron-based (as opposed to atom-based) description.

spontaneously develop density heterogeneities at various scales. These
heterogeneities can be regulated through a variety of multi-scale factors, such
as the interplay of exclusion interactions, the non-equilibrium nature of the
transport process and the network topology.
  We show how an effective rate approach allows to develop an understanding of
the stationary state of transport processes through complex networks from the
phase diagram of one single segment. For exclusion processes we rationalize
that the stationary state can be classified in three qualitatively different
regimes: a homogeneous phase as well as inhomogeneous network and segment
phases.
  In particular, we present here a study of the stationary state on networks of
three paradigmatic models from non-equilibrium statistical physics: the totally
asymmetric simple exclusion process, the partially asymmetric simple exclusion
process and the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process with Langmuir
kinetics. With these models we can interpolate between equilibrium (due to
bi-directional motion along a network or infinite diffusion) and
out-of-equilibrium active directed motion along a network. The study of these
models sheds further light on the emergence of density heterogeneities in

constructed. This transfer matrix is not Hermitian, but it is bounded, and it
can be used to construct correlation functions in the usual way. Combining
these observations with an extension of the Vafa--Witten theorem to the

is a (maximal) spacetime solution of the full set of Einstein equations,
compatible with the given set of data. The article then describes how to
generate initial data sets which satisfy the Einstein constraints, using the

cosmic acceleration. The cosmological dynamics of quintessence is reviewed,
paying particular attention to the evolution of the dark energy equation of

Using the analytic expression of w, we constrain quintessence models from the
observations of supernovae type Ia, cosmic microwave background, and baryon
acoustic oscillations. The tracking freezing models are hardly distinguishable
from the LCDM model, whereas in thawing models the today's field equation of
state is constrained to be w_0<-0.7 (95 % CL). We also derive an analytic
formula for the growth rate of matter density perturbations in dynamical dark
energy models, which allows a possibility to put further bounds on w from the
measurement of redshift-space distortions in the galaxy power spectrum. Finally
we review particle physics models of quintessence- such as those motivated by
supersymmetric theories. The field potentials of thawing models based on a
pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson or on extended supergravity theories have a nice
property that a tiny mass of quintessence can be protected against radiative

models to develop low complexity, iterative multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) detectors. The pair-wise graphical model is a bipartite graph where a
pair of variable nodes are related by an observation node represented by the
bivariate Gaussian function obtained by marginalizing the posterior joint
probability density under the Gaussian input assumption. Specifically, we
consider two types of pair-wise models, the fully connected and ring-type. The
pair-wise graphs are sparse, compared to the conventional graphical model in
[18], insofar as the number of edges connected to an observation node (edge
degree) is only two. Consequently the computations are much easier than those
of maximum likelihood (ML) detection, which are similar to the belief
propagation (BP) that is run over the fully connected bipartite graph. The link
level performance for non-Gaussian input is evaluated via simulations, and the
results show the validity of the proposed algorithms. We also customize the
algorithm with Gaussian input assumption to obtain the Gaussian BP run over the
two pair-wise graphical models and, for the ring-type, we prove its convergence
in mean to the linear minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimates. Since the
maximum a posterior (MAP) estimator for Gaussian input is equivalent to the
linear MMSE estimator, it shows the optimality, in mean, of the scheme for
Gaussian input.

takes into account one valence and three conduction bands, a strongly screened

electrons to a transverse optical phonon mode. The Falicov-Kimball model
extended in this way possesses a charge-density-wave state at low temperatures,
which is accompanied by a periodic lattice distortion. The charge ordering is
driven by a lattice deformation and electron-hole pairing (excitonic)
instability in combination. We show that both electron-phonon interaction and
phonon-phonon interaction must be taken into account at least up to quartic
order in the lattice displacement to achieve a stable chiral charge order. The
chiral property is exhibited in the ionic displacements. Furthermore, we

can be produced by the constant disk increasing in temperature and luminosity
as the truncation radius decreases. The soft Compton component likewise
increases, but the hard Compton does not, so that the spectrum in the hard

Suzaku observations of the black hole binary Cygnus X-1 on 2011 October 5 near
superior conjunction during the high/soft state, which enable us to map the
full evolution from the start and the end of the episodic accretion phenomena
or dips for the first time. We model the X-ray spectra during the event and
trace their evolution. The absorption line is rather weak in the first half of
the observation, but instantly deepens for ~10 ks, and weakens thereafter. The
overall change in equivalent width is a factor of ~3, peaking at an orbital
phase of ~0.08. This is evidence that the companion stellar wind feeding the
black hole is clumpy. By analyzing the line with a Voigt profile, it is found
to be consistent with a slightly redshifted Fe XXV transition, or possibly a
mixture of several species less ionized than Fe XXV. The data may be explained
by a clump located at a distance of ~10^(10-12) cm with a density of
~10^((-13)-(-11)) g cm^-3, which accretes onto and/or transits the
line-of-sight to the black hole, causing an instant decrease in the observed
degree of the ionization and/or an increase in density of the accreting matter.
Continued monitoring for individual events with future X-ray calorimeter
missions such as ASTRO-H and AXSIO will allow us to map out the accretion
environment in detail and how it changes between the various accretion states.

Suzaku HXD-PIN and HXD-GSO detector. It is notable that the 100-200 keV shot
profile is acquired for the first time owing to the HXD-GSO detector. The
intensity changes in a time-symmetric way, though the hardness does in a
time-asymmetric way. When the shot-phase-resolved spectra are quantified with

found to decrease gradually through the rising phase of the shot, while the
optical depth appears to increase. All the parameters return to their

properties of social networks and in turn processes such as navigation,
influence or information diffusion. Since time, attention and cognition are
inelastic resources, humans should have a predefined strategy to manage their
social interactions over time. However, the limited observational length of
existing human interaction datasets, together with the bursty nature of dyadic
communications have hampered the observation of tie dynamics in social
networks. Here we develop a method for the detection of tie
activation/deactivation, and apply it to a large longitudinal, cross-sectional
communication dataset ($\approx$ 19 months, $\approx$ 20 million people).
Contrary to the perception of ever-growing connectivity, we observe that
individuals exhibit a finite communication capacity, which limits the number of
ties they can maintain active. In particular we find that men have an overall
higher communication capacity than women and that this capacity decreases
gradually for both sexes over the lifespan of individuals (16-70 years). We are
then able to separate communication capacity from communication activity,
revealing a diverse range of tie activation patterns, from stable to
exploratory. We find that, in simulation, individuals exhibiting exploratory
strategies display longer time to receive information spreading in the network
those individuals with stable strategies. Our principled method to determine
the communication capacity of an individual allows us to quantify how
strategies for human interaction shape the dynamical evolution of social
networks.

highlighted by recent studies on international trade. We found an empirical
pattern, designated as the ""S-shaped curve"", that models the relationship
between economic size (logarithmic GDP) and export diversity (the number of
varieties of export products) on the detailed international trade data. As the
economic size of a country begins to increase, its export diversity initially
increases in an exponential manner, but overtime, this diversity growth slows
and eventually reaches an upper limit. The interdependence between size and
diversity takes the shape of an S-shaped curve that an be fitted by a logistic
equation. To explain this phenomenon, we introduce a new parameter called
""substitutability"" into the list of capabilities or factors of products in the
tri-partite network model (i.e., the country-capability-product model) of
Hidalgo et al. As we observe, when the substitutability is zero, the model
returns to Hidalgo's original model but failed to reproduce the S-shaped curve.
However, in a plot of data, the data increasingly resembles an the S-shaped
curve as the substitutability expands. Therefore, the diversity ceiling effect
can be explained by the substitutability of different capabilities.

the DM particle mass and annihilation cross section or decay life-time are

the AMS-02 positron fraction data alone favour a DM particle mass $\sim 500 \

states, which is significantly lower than that favoured by the Fermi-LAT data
of the total flux of electrons and positrons. The allowed regions by the two
experiments do not overlap at a high confidence level ($99.99999\%$C.L.). We
consider a number of propagation models with different halo height $Z_{h}$,
diffusion parameters $D_{0}$ and $\delta_{1/2}$, and power indices of primary
nucleon sources $\gamma_{p1/p2}$. The normalization and the slope of the
electron background are also allowed to vary. We find that the tension between
the two experiments can be only slightly reduced in the propagation model with
large $Z_{h}$ and $D_{0}$. The consistency of fit is improved for annihilation
channels with $2\tau$ and $4\tau$ final states which favour TeV scale DM
particle with large cross sections above $\sim 10^{-23}

to stabilization using a particular, yet broad enough, class of state-feedback
controllers, providing then a convex solution to the open problem of robust
dwell-time stabilization of impulsive systems using hybrid stability criteria.

poorly understood. In order to study the effects of X-ray radiation on the
surroundings of the black hole, we implement X-ray Dominated Region (XDR)
physics into Enzo and use the radiation transport module Moray to calculate the
radiative transfer for a polychromatic spectrum. In this work, we investigate
the effects of X-ray irradiation, produced by a central massive black hole
(MBH) with a mass of M = 5x10^4 M_(solar), on ambient gas with solar and zero
metallicity. We find that in the solar metallicity case, due to high opacity of
the metals, the energy deposition rate in the central region (< 20 pc) is high
and hence the temperatures in the center are on the order of 10^(5-7) K.
Moreover, due to the cooling ability and high intrinsic opacity of solar
metallicity gas, column densities of 10^(24) cm^(-2) are reached at a radius of
20 pc from the MBH. These column densities are about 3 orders of magnitudes
higher than in the zero metallicity case. Furthermore, in the zero metallicity
case an X-ray induced H II region is formed already after 5.8 Myr. This causes
a significant outflow of gas (~8x10^6 M_(solar) from the central region, with
the gas reaching outflow velocities up to ~100 km s^(-1). At later times, ~23
Myr after we insert the MBH, we find that the solar metallicity case also
develops an X-ray induced H II region, but delayed by ~17 Myr.

is clustered. In this paper we investigate the spectrum of the system
preconditioned by the deflation, coarse correction and adapted deflation
preconditioners. Our analysis shows that the spectrum of the preconditioned
system is highly impacted by the angle between the coarse space for the
construction of the three preconditioners and the subspace spanned by the
eigenvectors associated with the small eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix.
Furthermore, we prove that the accuracy of the inverse of projection matrix
also impacts the spectrum of the preconditioned system. Numerical experiments
emphasized the theoretical analysis.

breaking of translational invariance resulting in an inhomogeneous phase. We
follow up on recent numerical work, reporting results for a larger class of
cohomogeneity two black branes in AdS, dual to a holographic striped phase. We
construct the continuous moduli space of inhomogeneous black branes as a
function of the temperature. Minimising the free energy we determine the
dominant striped solutions, revealing a growth in the stripe size as the system
is cooled. We discuss the thermodynamic properties of this line of solutions.

sharp interface limit of the Allen-Cahn action functional and can be understood
as a formal action functional for a stochastically perturbed mean curvature

vector, integrated over time and space. For given initial and final conditions
we investigate the corresponding action minimization problem. We give a
generalized formulation and prove compactness and lower semicontinuity
properties of the action functional. Furthermore we characterize the
Euler-Lagrange equation for smooth stationary points and investigate conserved

pseudopotential technique together with a continuous-time quantum Monte-Carlo
approach, the resulting complex multiorbital electronic states are addressed in
a coherent fashion beyond static mean-field. General structural relaxations are
taken into account on the LDA level and cooperate with the driving forces from
strong electronic correlations. This alliance leads to an Ti($3d_{xy}$)
dominated low-energy quasiparticle peak and a lower Hubbard band in line with
photoemission studies. Furthermore correlation effects close to the
band-insulating bulk SrTiO$_3$ limit as well as the Mott-insulating bulk
LaTiO$_3$ limit are studied via realistic single-layer embeddings.

terrestrial surface on the Earth, current mean sea level and its geological

sciences. Theoretical modeling of the ubiquitous self-similar fractal patterns
observed on the Earth and their underlying rules is indeed of great importance.
Here I present a percolation description of the global topography of the Earth
in which the present mean sea level is automatically singled out as a critical
level in the model. This finding elucidates the origins of the appearance of
scale invariant patterns on the Earth. The criticality is shown to be
accompanied by a continental aggregation, unraveling an important correlation
between the water and long-range topographic evolution. To have a comparison
point in hand, I apply such analysis onto the lunar topography which reveals
various characteristic features of the Moon.

onedimensional (1D) insulating Hamiltonians. They claim that this spin pump is
a Z2 pump because For an isolated system, a single closed cycle of the pump
changes the expectation value of the spin at each end even when spin-orbit
interactions violate the conservation of spin. A second cycle, however, returns
the system to its original state. A Z2 topological invariant is proposed to
characterize the Z2 pump. In this comment we show their discussion on the spin
pump is inaccurate. Their reason why the isolated system return to its original
state after second cycle is unjustified and several claims contradict to this
return of the system are made in Ref 1. Detailed calculations and concrete
examples show the degeneracy of the first excited state at t = 0, T; is not
split by the electron-electron interaction in the way described in Ref 1 and
there is level crossing at t = T. In fact, despite of a detailed search, not a
single system behave as described in Fig. 1(d) in Ref 1 has been found. Thus we
conclude the isolated system won't return to its original state after two
cycles and the spin pump is not a Z2 pump in general.

proposed. In this model the possibility of unification of scalar gravity and
electromagnetism into a single united field is considered. Formally, the
generalization of the SRT is that instead of (1+3)-dimensional Minkowski space
the (1+4)-dimensional extension G is considered. As a fifth additional
coordinate the interval S is used. This value is saved under the usual Lorentz
transformations in Minkowski space M, but it changes when the transformations
in the extended space G are used. We call this model the extended space model
(ESM). From a physical point of view our expansion means that processes in
which the rest mass of the particles changes are acceptable now. If the rest
mass of a particle does not change and the physical quantities do not depend on
an additional variable S, then the electromagnetic and gravitational fields
exist independently of each other. But if the rest mass is variable and there
is a dependence on S, then these two fields are combined into a single united
field. In the extended space model a photon can have a nonzero mass and this
mass can be either positive or negative. The gravitational effects such as the
speed of escape, gravitational red shift and deflection of light can be
analyzed in the frame of the extended space model. In this model all these
gravitational effects can be found algebraically by the rotations in the (1+4)
dimensional space. Now it becomes possible to predict some future results of
visible size of super massive objects in our Universe due to new stage of
experimental astronomy development in the Radio Astron Project and analyze
phenomena of the star V838 Monocerotis explosion as possible Local Big Bang
(LBB).

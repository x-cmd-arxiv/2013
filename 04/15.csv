easily-observed examples of radiation hydrodynamics. Boundaries where
fully-ionized H II regions transition to neutral/molecular photodissociation
regions (PDRs) are of particular interest because marked temperature and
density contrasts across the boundaries lead to evaporative flows and fluid
dynamical instabilities that can evolve into spectacular pillar-like
structures. When detached from their parent clouds, pillars become ionized
globules that often harbor one or more young stars. H2 molecules at the
interface between a PDR and an H II region absorb ultraviolet light from
massive stars, and the resulting fluoresced infrared emission lines are an
ideal way to trace this boundary independent of obscuring dust. This paper
presents H2 images of four regions of massive star formation that illustrate
different types of PDR boundaries. The Ara OB1 star formation region contains a
striking long wall that has several wavy structures which are present in H2,
but the emission is not particularly bright because the ambient UV fluxes are
relatively low. In contrast, the Carina star formation region shows strong H2
fluorescence both along curved walls and at the edges of spectacular pillars
that in some cases have become detached from their parent clouds. The
less-spectacular but more well-known Eagle Nebula has two regions that have
strong fluorescence in addition to its pillars. While somewhat older than the
other regions, Cyg OB2 has the highest number of massive stars of the regions
surveyed and contains many isolated, fluoresced globules that have head-tail
morphologies which point towards the sources of ionizing radiation. These
images provide a collection of potential astrophysical analogs that may relate
to ablated interfaces observed in laser experiments of radiation hydrodynamics.

formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass of star-forming galaxies, the so-called
star-forming main sequence. An empirical modeling approach (2-SFM) which
distinguishes between the main sequence and rarer starburst galaxies is capable
of reproducing most statistical properties of infrared galaxies. In this paper,
we extend this approach by establishing a connection between stellar mass and
halo mass with the technique of abundance matching. Based on a few, simple
assumptions and a physically motivated formalism, our model successfully
predicts the (cross-)power spectra of the cosmic infrared background (CIB), the
cross-correlation between CIB and cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing,
and the correlation functions of bright, resolved infrared galaxies measured by
Herschel, Planck, ACT and SPT. We use this model to infer the redshift
distribution these observables, as well as the level of correlation between
CIB-anisotropies at different wavelengths. We also predict that more than 90%
of cosmic star formation activity occurs in halos with masses between 10^11.5
and 10^13.5 Msun. Taking into account subsequent mass growth of halos, this
implies that the majority of stars were initially (at z>3) formed in the
progenitors of clusters, then in groups at 0.5<z<3 and finally in
Milky-Way-like halos at z<0.5. At all redshifts, the dominant contribution to
the star formation rate density stems from halos of mass ~10^12 Msun, in which
the instantaneous star formation efficiency is maximal (~70%). The strong
redshift-evolution of SFR in the galaxies that dominate the CIB is thus
plausibly driven by increased accretion from the cosmic web onto halos of this
characteristic mass scale. Material available at

We find that the orbital period of this binary (in the numerical coordinates)

1%. Interestingly, we find that the time derivative of the coordinate
separation is dominated by a purely gauge effect leading to an apparent
contraction and expansion of the orbit at twice the orbital frequency. Based on
these results, we improved our evolution techniques and studied a set of black
hole binaries in quasi-circular orbits starting at D=20M, D=50M, and D=100M for

simultaneously solving the collisional Boltzmann equation for gas and the
collisionless Boltzmann equation for stars and dark matter for problems
important to galaxy evolution. This project is motivated by the need to
understand the controlling dynamics at interfaces between gases of widely
differing densities and temperature, i.e. multiphase media. While more
expensive than hydrodynamics, the kinetic approach does not suffer from
discontinuities and it applies when the continuum limit does not, such as in
the collapse of galaxy clusters and at the interface between coronal halo gas
and a thin neutral gas layer. Finally, the momentum flux is carried,
self-consistently, by particles and this approach explicitly resolves and
thereby captures shocks. The DSMC method splits the solution into two pieces:
1) the evolution of the phase-space flow without collisions; and 2) the
evolution governed the collision term alone without phase-space flow. This
splitting approach makes DSMC an ideal match to existing particle-based n-body
codes. If the mean free path becomes very small compared to any scale of
interest, the method abandons simulated particle collisions and simply adopts
the relaxed solution in each interaction cell consistent with the overall
energy and momentum fluxes. This is functionally equivalent to solving the
Navier-Stokes equations on a mesh. Our implementation is tested using the Sod
shock tube problem and the non-linear development of an Kelvin-Helmholtz
unstable shear layer.

n-body code to study the dynamics of the interaction between a gas-rich spiral
galaxy and intracluster or intragroup medium, often known as the ram pressure
scenario. The advantage of this gas kinetic approach over traditional
hydrodynamics is explicit treatment of the interface between the hot and cold,
dense and rarefied media typical of astrophysical flows and the explicit
conservation of energy and momentum and the interface. This approach yields
some new physical insight. Owing to the shock and backward wave that forms at
the point ICM--ISM contact, ICM gas is compressed, heated and slowed. The shock
morphology is Mach-disk-like. In the outer galaxy, the hot turbulent post-shock
gas flows around the galaxy disk, while heating and ablating the initially cool
disk gas. The outer gas and angular momentum are lost to the flow. In the inner
galaxy, the hot gas pressurizes the neutral ISM gas causing a strong two-phase
instability. As a result, the momentum of the wind is no longer impulsively
communicated to the cold gas as assumed in the Gunn-Gott (1972) formula, but
oozes through the porous disk, transferring its linear momentum to the disk en
masse. The escaping gas mixture has a net positive angular momentum and forms a
slowly rotating sheath. The shear flow caused by the post-shock ICM flowing
through the porous multiphase ISM creates a strong Kelvin-Helmholtz instability
in the disk that results in Cartwheel-like ring and spoke morphology.

investigating the role played by processes taking place at various spatial and
temporal scales through a procedure of coarse graining. The coarser is the
graining of the climatic fields, the lower is the resulting estimate of the
material entropy production. In other terms, all the spatial and temporal
scales of variability of the thermodynamic fields provide a positive
contribution to the material entropy production. At all scales, the temperature
fields and the heating fields resulting from the convergence of turbulent
fluxes have a negative correlation, while the opposite holds between the
temperature fields and the radiative heating fields. Moreover, the latter
correlations are stronger, which confirms that radiation acts as primary driver
for the climatic processes, while the material fluxes dampen the resulting
fluctuations through dissipative processes. Using specific coarse-graining
procedures, one can separate the various contributions to the material entropy
production coming from the dissipation of kinetic energy, the vertical sensible
and latent heat fluxes, and the large scale horizontal fluxes. Most of the
entropy production is associated to irreversible exchanges occurring along the
vertical direction, and neglecting the horizontal and time variability of the
fields has a small impact on the estimate of the material entropy production.
The approach presented here seems promising for testing climate models, for
assessing the impact of changing their parametrizations and their resolution,
and for investigating the atmosphere of exoplanets. Our findings deserve to be
explored in a more general context, because they provide a way for
understanding the relationship between forced fluctuations and dissipative
processes in continuum systems.

resonances within the normally hyperbolic invariant manifold may, or may not,

such resonances results in a change in topology of the dividing surface, but
does not affect our ability to define a DS. The flux through the DS varies
continuously with energy, even as the energy is varied in such a way that
normal hyperbolicity is lost. For our examples the gap time distributions
exhibit singularities at energies corresponding to the existence of homoclinic

from meteorites and analysed using high-resolution mass spectrometry. The most
widely studied type of stardust is silicon carbide (SiC). Thousands of these
grains have been analysed with high precision for their Si isotopic
composition. Here we show that the distribution of the Si isotopic composition
of the vast majority of stardust SiC grains carry the imprints of a spread in
the age-metallicity distribution of their parent stars and of a power-law
increase of the relative formation efficiency of SiC dust with the metallicity.
This result offers a solution for the long-standing problem of silicon in
stardust SiC grains, confirms the necessity of coupling chemistry and dynamics
in simulations of the chemical evolution of our Galaxy, and constrains the
modelling of dust condensation in stellar winds as function of the metallicity.

the intrinsic understanding of fundamental mechanisms in complex biochemical
networks. Typically, such mathematical models involve networks of coupled jump
stochastic processes with a large number of parameters that need to be suitably
calibrated against experimental data. In this direction, the parameter
sensitivity analysis of reaction networks is an essential mathematical and
computational tool, yielding information regarding the robustness and the
identifiability of model parameters. However, existing sensitivity analysis
approaches such as variants of the finite difference method can have an
overwhelming computational cost in models with a high-dimensional parameter
space. We develop a sensitivity analysis methodology suitable for complex
stochastic reaction networks with a large number of parameters. The proposed
approach is based on Information Theory methods and relies on the
quantification of information loss due to parameter perturbations between
time-series distributions. For this reason, we need to work on path-space,
i.e., the set consisting of all stochastic trajectories, hence the proposed
approach is referred to as ""pathwise"". The pathwise sensitivity analysis method
is realized by employing the rigorously-derived Relative Entropy Rate (RER),
which is directly computable from the propensity functions. A key aspect of the
method is that an associated pathwise Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) is
defined, which in turn constitutes a gradient-free approach to quantifying
parameter sensitivities. The structure of the FIM turns out to be
block-diagonal, revealing hidden parameter dependencies and sensitivities in
reaction networks.

wave (mmW) frequencies between 30 and 300 GHz have been attracting growing
attention as a possible candidate for next-generation micro- and picocellular
wireless networks. The mmW bands offer orders of magnitude greater spectrum
than current cellular allocations and enable very high-dimensional antenna
arrays for further gains via spatial multiplexing. However, the propagation of
mmW signals in outdoor non line-of-sight (NLOS) links remains challenging and
the feasibility of wide-area mmW cellular networks is far from clear. This
paper uses recent real-world measurements at 28 GHz in New York City to provide
a realistic assessment of mmW picocellular networks in a dense urban
deployment. It is found that, even under conservative propagation assumptions,
mmW systems with cell radii of 100m can offer an order of magnitude increase in
capacity over current state-of-the-art 4G cellular networks with similar cell
density. However, it is also shown that such mmW networks may operate in a
largely power-limited regime where the full spatial and bandwidth degrees of
freedom are not fully utilized. This power-limited regime contrasts
significantly with current bandwidth-limited cellular systems, requiring
alternate technologies for mmW systems that may unlock further gains that mmW
frequency bands offer.

controls. We lay out a general methodology to estimate an effect of interest
based on the construction of an instrument that immunize against model
selection mistakes and apply it to the case of logistic binary choice model.
More specifically we propose new methods for estimating and constructing
confidence regions for a regression parameter of primary interest $\alpha_0$, a
parameter in front of the regressor of interest, such as the treatment variable
or a policy variable. These methods allow to estimate $\alpha_0$ at the
root-$n$ rate when the total number $p$ of other regressors, called controls,
potentially exceed the sample size $n$ using sparsity assumptions. The sparsity
assumption means that there is a subset of $s<n$ controls which suffices to
accurately approximate the nuisance part of the regression function.
Importantly, the estimators and these resulting confidence regions are valid
uniformly over $s$-sparse models satisfying $s^2\log^2 p = o(n)$ and other
technical conditions. These procedures do not rely on traditional consistent
model selection arguments for their validity. In fact, they are robust with
respect to moderate model selection mistakes in variable selection. Under
suitable conditions, the estimators are semi-parametrically efficient in the
sense of attaining the semi-parametric efficiency bounds for the class of
models in this paper.

directed topology is considered in this study. Depending on whether the agent's
full state is available or not, two distributed protocols are proposed to
ensure that states of all agents can be convergent to a same stationary value.
In the proposed protocols, the gain vector associated with the agent's
(estimated) state and the gain vector associated with the relative (estimated)
states between agents are designed in a sophisticated way. By this particular
design, the high-order integral multi-agent system can be transformed into a
first-order integral multi-agent system. And the convergence of the transformed
first-order integral agent's state indicates the convergence of the original
high-order integral agent's state if and only if all roots of the polynomial,
whose coefficients are the entries of the gain vector associated with the
relative (estimated) states between agents, are in the open left-half complex
plane. Therefore, many analysis techniques in the first-order integral
multi-agent system can be directly borrowed to solve the problems in the
high-order integral multi-agent system. Due to this property, it is proved that
to reach a consensus, the switching directed topology of multi-agent system is
only required to be ""uniformly jointly quasi-strongly connected"", which seems
the mildest connectivity condition in the literature. In addition, the
consensus problem of discrete-time high-order integral multi-agent systems is
studied. The corresponding consensus protocol and performance analysis are
presented. Finally, three simulation examples are provided to show the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.

that at large coupling strength, if the nonlinear frequency shift parameter is
below a certain value, then there is a unique attractor for which the

The formulation can incorporate a large class of network topologies,
interference models, SNR-to-rate mappings and network constraints. In addition,
the model can applied in carrier aggregation scenarios where mobiles can be
served by multiple cells simultaneously. While the problem is non-convex, our
main contribution shows that the optimization admits a separable dual
decomposition. This property enables fast computation of upper bounds on the
utility as well as an efficient, distributed implementation for approximate
local optimization via augmented Lagrangian techniques. Simulations are
presented in heterogeneous networks with mixtures of macro and picocells. We
demonstrate significant value of the proposed methods in scenarios with
variable backhaul capacity in the femtocell links and in cases where the user
density is sufficiently low that lightly-used cells can reduce power.

has attracted attention of researchers due to NP-Complete nature of the
problem. In Grid environment, scheduling is deciding about assignment of tasks
to available resources. Scheduling in Grid is challenging when the tasks have
dependencies and resources are heterogeneous. The main objective in scheduling
of dependent tasks is minimizing make-span. Due to NP-complete nature of
scheduling problem, exact solutions cannot generate schedule efficiently.
Therefore, researchers apply heuristic or random search techniques to get
optimal or near to optimal solution of such problems. In this paper, we show
how Genetic Algorithm can be used to solve dependent task scheduling problem.
We describe how initial population can be generated using random assignment and
height based approaches. We also present design of crossover and mutation
operators to enable scheduling of dependent tasks application without violating
dependency constraints. For implementation of GA based scheduling, we explore
and analyze SimGrid and GridSim simulation toolkits. From results, we found
that SimGrid is suitable, as it has support of SimDag API for DAG applications.
We found that GA based approach can generate schedule for dependent tasks

processing environments. Image processing in general and hence automated
feature extraction, is highly computation intensive, where performance
improvements have a direct impact on societal needs. In this context, an
algorithm has been formulated for automated feature extraction from a
panchromatic or multispectral image based on image processing techniques. Two
Laplacian of Guassian (LoG) masks were applied on the image individually
followed by detection of zero crossing points and extracting the pixels based
on their standard deviation with the surrounding pixels. The two extracted
images with different LoG masks were combined together which resulted in an
image with the extracted features and edges. Finally the user is at liberty to
apply the image smoothing step depending on the noise content in the extracted
image. The image is passed through a hybrid median filter to remove the salt
and pepper noise from the image. This paper discusses the aforesaid algorithm
for automated feature extraction, necessity of deployment of GPUs for the same;
system-level challenges and quantifies the benefits of integrating GPUs in such

performance margin can be achieved with the best utilization of GPU resources
and an efficient parallelization strategy. Performance results in comparison

L-cysteine and its oxidized form, L-cystine. Although enhanced radial migration
in plates suggested positive chemotaxis to both amino acids, capillary assays
failed to show an attractant response to either, in cells expressing only these
two chemoreceptors. In vivo fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)
measurements of kinase activity revealed that in wild-type bacteria, cysteine
and cystine are chemoeffectors of opposing sign, the reduced form being a
chemoattractant and the oxidized form a repellent. The attractant response to
cysteine was mediated primarily by Tsr, as reported earlier for E. coli. The
repellent response to cystine was mediated by McpB / C. Adaptive recovery upon
cystine exposure required the methyl-transferase/-esterase pair, CheR / CheB,
but restoration of kinase activity was never complete (i.e. imperfect
adaptation). We provide a plausible explanation for the attractant-like
responses to both cystine and cysteine motility plates, and speculate that the
opposing signs of response to this redox pair might afford Salmonella a
mechanism to gauge and avoid oxidative environments.

global properties and collective modes of atomic nuclei. Of particular interest
is the response of the nucleus to a time-dependent external field that impacts
the low-energy multipole and beta-decay strength.
  Purpose: We propose a method to compute low-lying collective modes in
deformed nuclei within the finite amplitude method (FAM) based on the
quasiparticle random-phase approximation (QRPA). By using the analytic property
of the response function, we find the QRPA amplitudes by computing the residua
of the FAM amplitudes by means of a contour integration around the QRPA poles
in a complex frequency plane.
  Methods: We use the superfluid nuclear density functional theory with Skyrme
energy density functionals, FAM-QRPA approach, and the conventional matrix
formulation of the QRPA (MQRPA).
  Results: We demonstrate that the complex-energy FAM-QRPA method reproduces
low-lying collective states obtained within the conventional matrix formulation
of the QRPA theory. Illustrative calculations are performed for the isoscalar
monopole strength in deformed 24Mg and for low-lying K = 0 quadrupole
vibrational modes of deformed Yb and Er isotopes.
  Conclusions: The proposed FAM-QRPA approach allows one to efficiently
calculate low-lying collective modes in spherical and deformed nuclei
throughout the entire nuclear landscape, including shape-vibrational
excitations, pairing vibrational modes, and beta-decay rates.

  We describe the altitude dependence of the parameters and the different
physics of collisions between charged species, and between charged and neutrals
species. Regions of dominance of each type of collisions are clearly
identified. We determine the layers within which either electrons or ions or
both are unmagnetized. Protons are shown to be un-magnetized in the lower
atmosphere in a layer that is at least 1000 km thick even for a kilo-Gauss
magnetic field that decreases exponentially with altitude. In these layers the
dynamics of charged species cannot be affected by the magnetic field, and this
fact is used in our modeling. Viscosity and thermal conductivity coefficients
are calculated for layers where ions are unmagnetized. We compare viscosity and
friction and determine the regions of dominance of each of the phenomena.

spectroscopy has recently delivered its first detections of molecular
absorption in exoplanet atmospheres, both in transmission and thermal emission
spectra. Targeting the combined signal from individual lines in molecular
bands, these measurements use variations in the planet radial velocity to
disentangle the planet signal from telluric and stellar contaminants. In this
paper we apply high resolution spectroscopy to probe molecular absorption in
the day-side spectrum of the bright transiting hot Jupiter HD 189733b. We
observed HD 189733b with the CRIRES high-resolution near-infrared spectograph
on the Very Large Telescope during three nights. We detect a 5-sigma absorption
signal from CO at a contrast level of ~4.5e-4 with respect to the stellar
continuum, revealing the planet orbital radial velocity at 154+4/-3 km s-1.
This allows us to solve for the planet and stellar mass in a similar way as for
stellar eclipsing binaries, resulting in Ms= 0.846+0.068/-0.049 Msun and Mp=
1.162+0.058/-0.039 MJup. No significant absorption is detected from H2O, CO2 or
CH4 and we determined upper limits on their line contrasts here. The detection
of CO in the day-side spectrum of HD 189733b can be made consistent with the
haze layer proposed to explain the optical to near-infrared transmission
spectrum if the layer is optically thin at the normal incidence angles probed
by our observations, or if the CO abundance is high enough for the CO
absorption to originate from above the haze. Our non-detection of CO2 at 2.0
micron is not inconsistent with the deep CO2 absorption from low resolution
NICMOS secondary eclipse data in the same wavelength range. If genuine, the
absorption would be so strong that it blanks out any planet light completely in
this wavelength range, leaving no high-resolution signal to be measured.

symmetry which becomes the symmetry of the quantum states. We start by
resolving the space-time canonical variables of the point particle into inner
products of Weyl spinors with components in a Clifford algebra. Next, we show
that a system of N particles has a U(N) symmetry that mixes the Clifford
coordinates and momenta belonging to different particles. The inner products of
these variables are assembled into Hermitian matrices X and P which are
employed in defining a general unitarily invariant dynamical system. When X and
P commute, this system can be gauged back into the original system of
independent particles. When they do not commute, the system becomes irreducible
and infinite and generates a space-time canonical system formally identical to
Matrix Mechanics. The continuum limit is identified as a particular
parametrization of a relativistic string in Clifford space.

theoretical models. We find that the mitotic waves travel across the embryo at
a well-defined speed that decreases with replication cycle. We find two markers
of the wavefront in each cycle, corresponding to the onsets of metaphase and
anaphase. Each of these onsets is followed by displacements of the nuclei that
obey the same wavefront pattern. To understand the mitotic wavefronts
theoretically we analyze wavefront propagation in excitable media. We study two
classes of models, one with biochemical signaling and one with mechanical
signaling. We find that the dependence of wavefront speed on cycle number is
most naturally explained by mechanical signaling, and that the entire process
suggests a scenario in which biochemical and mechanical signaling are coupled.

an edge of the integer quantum Hall regime or in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer,
considering a capacitive Coulomb interaction and using a bosonization approach.
When the packet propagates along a chiral quantum Hall edge, we find that its
electron density profile becomes more distorted from Lorentzian due to the
generation of electron-hole excitations, as the interaction strength increases
yet stays in a weak interaction regime. However, as the interaction strength
becomes larger and enters a strong interaction regime, the distortion becomes
weaker and eventually the Lorentzian packet shape is recovered. The recovery of
the packet shape leads to an interesting feature of the interference visibility
of the symmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometer whose two arms have the same
interaction strength. As the interaction strength increases, the visibility
decreases from the maximum value in the weak interaction regime, and then
increases to the maximum value in the strong interaction regime. We argue that
this counterintuitive result also occurs under other types of interactions.

pronounced variations of the Dopplershift varying from 0 to 4 km/s about the
average of 1.5 km/s. This fact implies a persistent redshift of the Halpha core
with a redward asymmetry of about 0.5 km/s, suggesting an inverse-C bisector.
The variations of the core intensity up to +-10% and the core width up to +-5%
about the respective averages are much less pronounced, but still detectable.
The core intensity variations lag behind the Dopplershift variations about 2.1
min. The Halpha core width tends to correlate with the Dopplershift and
anticorrelate with the asymmetry, suggesting that more redshifted Halpha
profiles are wider and the broadening of the Halpha core is accompanied with a
change of the core asymmetry from redward to blueward. We also found a striking
anticorrelation between the core asymmetry and the Dopplershift, suggesting a
change of the core asymmetry from redward to blueward with an increasing

  A & A",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201220922",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Aims: We aim to investigate the abundances of light deuterium-bearing species
such as HD, H2D+ and D2H+ in a gas-grain chemical model including an extensive
description of deuterium and spin state chemistry, in physical conditions
appropriate to the very centers of starless cores. Methods: We combine a
gas-grain chemical model with radiative transfer calculations to simulate
density and temperature structure in starless cores. The chemical model
includes deuterated forms of species with up to 4 atoms and the spin states of
the light species H2, H2+ and H3+ and their deuterated forms. Results: We find
that HD eventually depletes from the gas phase because deuterium is efficiently
incorporated to grain-surface HDO, resulting in inefficient HD production on
grains. HD depletion has consequences not only on the abundances of e.g. H2D+
and D2H+, whose production depends on the abundance of HD, but also on the spin
state abundance ratios of the various light species, when compared with the
complete depletion model where heavy elements do not influence the chemistry.
Conclusions: While the eventual HD depletion leads to the disappearance of
light deuterium-bearing species from the gas phase in a relatively short
timescale at high density, we find that at late stages of core evolution the
abundances of H2D+ and D2H+ increase toward the core edge and the disributions
become extended. The HD depletion timescale increases if less oxygen is
initially present in the gas phase, owing to chemical interaction between the
gas and the dust predecing the starless core phase. Our results are greatly
affected if H2 is allowed to tunnel on grain surfaces, and therefore more
experimental data not only on tunneling but also on the O + H2 surface reaction
in particular is needed.

(sc-GW) approach -- i.e. based on the solution of the Dyson equation -- in an
all-electron numeric atom-centered orbital (NAO) basis set. We cast Hedin's
equations into a matrix form that is suitable for numerical calculations by
means of i) the resolution of identity technique to handle 4-center integrals;
and ii) a basis representation for the imaginary-frequency dependence of
dynamical operators. In contrast to perturbative G0W0, sc-GW provides a
consistent framework for ground- and excited-state properties and facilitates
an unbiased assessment of the GW approximation. For excited-states, we
benchmark sc-GW for five molecules relevant for organic photovoltaic
applications: thiophene, benzothiazole, 1,2,5-thiadiazole, naphthalene, and
tetrathiafulvalene. At self-consistency, the quasi-particle energies are found
to be in good agreement with experiment and, on average, more accurate than
G0W0 based on Hartree-Fock (HF) or density-functional theory with the
Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional. Based on the
Galitskii-Migdal total energy, structural properties are investigated for a set
of diatomic molecules. For binding energies, bond lengths, and vibrational
frequencies sc-GW and G0W0 achieve a comparable performance, which is, however,
not as good as that of exact-exchange plus correlation in the random-phase
approximation (EX+cRPA) and its advancement to renormalized second-order
perturbation theory (rPT2). Finally, the improved description of dipole moments
for a small set of diatomic molecules demonstrates the quality of the sc-GW
ground state density.

minimum size of craters serves as a proxy for palaeopressure of planetary

crater on Mars contains a high density of preserved ancient craters interbedded
with river deposits and thus can provide constraints on atmospheric density

ancient craters in Aeolis Dorsa that date to about 3.6 Gyr ago and compare
their size distribution with models of atmospheric filtering of impactors. We

length, both in helical and non-helical cases, are found by solving the
autoinduction and Navier-Stokes equations in mean-field approximation.
Analytical results are derived in Minkowski spacetime and then extended to the
case of a Friedmann universe with zero spatial curvature, both in radiation and
matter dominated eras. The three possible viscous free-streaming phases are
characterized by a drag term in the Navier-Stokes equation which depends on the
free-streaming properties of neutrinos, photons, or hydrogen atoms,
respectively. In the case of non-helical magnetic fields, the magnetic
intensity $B$ and the magnetic correlation length $\xi_B$ evolve asymptotically
with the temperature $T$ as $B(T) \simeq \kappa_B (N_i v_i)^{\varrho_1}

from logarithmic corrections and a factor proportional to the initial
fractional helicity, power-like evolution laws equal to those in the

optical networks. In particular, we study how to use quantum key distribution
(QKD) in common optical network infrastructures and propose a method to
overcome its distance limitations. QKD is the first technology offering
information theoretic secret-key distribution that relies only on the
fundamental principles of quantum physics. Point-to-point QKD devices have
reached a mature industrial state; however, these devices are severely limited
in distance, since signals at the quantum level (e.g. single photons) are
highly affected by the losses in the communication channel and intermediate
devices. To overcome this limitation, intermediate nodes (i.e. repeaters) are
used. Both, quantum-regime and trusted, classical, repeaters have been proposed
in the QKD literature, but only the latter can be implemented in practice. As a
novelty, we propose here a new QKD network model based on the use of not fully
trusted intermediate nodes, referred as weakly trusted repeaters. This approach
forces the attacker to simultaneously break several paths to get access to the
exchanged key, thus improving significantly the security of the network. We
formalize the model using network codes and provide real scenarios that allow
users to exchange secure keys over metropolitan optical networks using only
passive components. Moreover, the theoretical framework allows to extend these
scenarios not only to accommodate more complex trust constraints, but also to
consider robustness and resiliency constraints on the network.

that the dominant frequency, $\nu_1$, is most likely a pure $\ell=1$ mode and
the low frequency, $\nu_A$, is a dipole retrograde mode. We construct a set of
seismic models which fit two pulsational frequencies corresponding to the modes
$\ell= 0,$ p$_1$ and $\ell= 1,$ g$_1$ and reproduce also the complex amplitude
of the bolometric flux variations, $f$, for both frequencies simultaneously.
Some of these seismic models reproduce also the frequency $\nu_A$, as a mode
$\ell= 1,$ g$_{13}$ or g$_{14}$, and its empirical values of $f$. Moreover, it
was possible to find a model fitting the six 12 Lac frequencies (the first five

$V_{\rm rot}\approx 75$ km/s. In the next step, we check the effects of model

us with three-dimensional data in [OIII]5007 and [SII]6717,6731 at an 0.33x0.33

two, partially overlapping, sulphur lines and used them to calculate electron
densities across the remnant at high signal-to-noise ratio. Our analysis
reveals a structure that stretches from the position of the ""blob"", and into
the plane of the sky at a position angle of about 60 degrees. We speculate that
the pulsar is positioned along this activity axis, where it has a velocity
along the line of sight of a few hundred km/s. The ""blob"" is most likely a
region of shock activity, as it is mainly bright in [SII]; future observations

that SPEA 2 is better algorithm compared to NSGA II based on the features like

combinations of them. Instead of building a predictive model of the response
given combinations of predictors, we model the conditional distribution of
predictors given the response. This inverse modeling perspective motivates us
to propose a stepwise procedure based on likelihood-ratio tests, which is
effective and computationally efficient in identifying important variables
without specifying a parametric relationship between predictors and the
response. For example, the proposed procedure is able to detect variables with
pairwise, three-way or even higher-order interactions among $p$ predictors with
a computational time of $O(p)$ instead of $O(p^k)$ (with $k$ being the highest
order of interactions). Its excellent empirical performance in comparison with
existing methods is demonstrated through simulation studies as well as real
data examples. Consistency of the variable selection procedure when both the
number of predictors and the sample size go to infinity is established.

~10^9 M_Sun observed already at z ~ 6 may have formed through the direct
collapse of primordial gas in T_vir >~ 10^4 K halos, whereby the gas must stay
hot (~10^4 K) in order to avoid fragmentation.
  Aims. The interplay between magnetic fields, turbulence, and a UV radiation
background during the gravitational collapse of primordial gas in a halo is
explored; in particular, the possibilities for avoiding fragmentation are
examined.
  Methods. Using an analytical one-zone model, the evolution of a cloud of
primordial gas is followed from its initial cosmic expansion through
turnaround, virialization, and collapse up to a density of 10^7 cm-3.
  Results. It was found that in halos with no significant turbulence, the
critical UV background intensity (J_21^crit) for keeping the gas hot is lower
by a factor ~10 for an initial comoving magnetic field B_0 ~ 2 nG than for the
zero-field case, and even lower for stronger fields. In turbulent halos,
J_21^crit is found to be a factor ~10 lower than for the
zero-field-zero-turbulence case, and the stronger the turbulence (more massive
halo and/or stronger turbulent heating) the lower J_21^crit.
  Conclusions. The reduction in J_21^crit is particularly important, since it
exponentially increases the number of halos exposed to a supercritical
radiation background.

resonators is of both fundamental and applied interest, but there have been no
feasible proposals to date for achieving it. At the same time, the Bose-Hubbard
model with attractive interactions (ABH) is theoretically known to have a phase
transition from the superfluid phase to a highly entangled nonlocal
superposition, but observation of this phase transition has remained out of
experimental reach. In this theoretical work, we jointly address these two
problems by (1) proposing an experimentally accessible quantum simulation of
the ABH phase transition in an array of tunably coupled superconducting circuit
microwave resonators and (2) incorporating the simulation into a highly
scalable protocol that takes as input any microwave resonator state with
negligible occupation of number states |0> and |1> and nonlocally superposes it
across the whole array of resonators. The large-scale multipartite entanglement
produced by the protocol is of the W-type, which is well-known for its
robustness. The protocol utilizes the ABH phase transition to generate the
multipartite entanglement of all of the resonators in parallel, and is
therefore deterministic and permits an increase in resonator number without
increase in protocol complexity; the number of resonators is limited instead by
system characteristics such as resonator frequency disorder and inter-resonator
coupling strength. Only one local and two global controls are required for the
protocol. We numerically demonstrate the protocol with realistic system
parameters, and estimate that current experimental capabilities can realize the
protocol with high fidelity for greater than 40 resonators.

pairs to minimize a total distance within matched pairs. Nonbipartite matching
has been used to strengthen instrumental variables in observational studies of
treatment effects, essentially by forming pairs that are similar in terms of
covariates but very different in the strength of encouragement to accept the
treatment. Optimal nonbipartite matching is typically done using network
optimization techniques that can be quick, running in polynomial time, but
these techniques limit the tools available for matching. Instead, we use
integer programming techniques, thereby obtaining a wealth of new tools not
previously available for nonbipartite matching, including fine and near-fine
balance for several nominal variables, forced near balance on means and optimal
subsetting. We illustrate the methods in our on-going study of outcomes of
late-preterm births in California, that is, births of 34 to 36 weeks of
gestation. Would lengthening the time in the hospital for such births reduce
the frequency of rapid readmissions? A straightforward comparison of babies who
stay for a shorter or longer time would be severely biased, because the
principal reason for a long stay is some serious health problem. We need an
instrument, something inconsequential and haphazard that encourages a shorter
or a longer stay in the hospital. It turns out that babies born at certain
times of day tend to stay overnight once with a shorter length of stay, whereas
babies born at other times of day tend to stay overnight twice with a longer
length of stay, and there is nothing particularly special about a baby who is
born at 11:00 pm.

applications. One of the most important products of a raw satellite image is
the classified map which labels the image pixels into meaningful classes.
Though several parametric and non-parametric classifiers have been developed
thus far, accurate labeling of the pixels still remains a challenge. In this
paper, we propose a new reliable multiclass-classifier for identifying class
labels of a satellite image in remote sensing applications. The proposed
multiclass-classifier is a generalization of a binary classifier based on the
flexible ensemble of regression trees model called Bayesian Additive Regression
Trees (BART). We used three small areas from the LANDSAT 5 TM image, acquired
on August 15, 2009 (path/row: 08/29, L1T product, UTM map projection) over
Kings County, Nova Scotia, Canada to classify the land-use. Several prediction
accuracy and uncertainty measures have been used to compare the reliability of
the proposed classifier with the state-of-the-art classifiers in remote
sensing.

are studied. Such colimits include most universal constructions with counits,
like ordinary colimits in categories, weighted colimits in enriched categories,
and left Kan extensions.
  In the first chapter we recall the notion of 2-categories equipped with
promorphisms (also simply called equipments), that provide a coherent way of
adding bimodule-like morphisms to a 2-category. In the second chapter we recall
two ways of defining weighted colimits in equipments. Most important to us is
their original definition, introduced by Wood, in equipments that are endowed
with a closed structure. The second notion, of what we call pointwise weighted
colimits, was introduced by Grandis and Par\'e. It requires no extra structure
and generalises Street's notion of pointwise left Kan extensions in
2-categories. The main result of the second chapter gives a condition, on
closed equipments, under which these two notions coincide.
  In the third chapter we consider monads on equipments. The main idea of this
thesis, given in the fourth chapter, generalises the notions of lax and colax
morphisms, of algebras over a 2-monad, to notions of lax and colax
promorphisms, of algebras over a monad on an equipment. One of these, that of
right colax promorphisms, is well suited to the construction of weighted
colimits. In particular, given a monad T on an equipment K, we will show that
T-algebras, colax T-morphisms and right colax T-promorphisms form a double
category T-rcProm. Although weaker than equipments, double categories still
allow definition of weighted colimits, and our main result states that the
forgetful functor T-rcProm -> K lifts all weighted colimits whenever K is
closed, under some mild conditions on T.

The eigenstates of these two observables form a pair of mutually unbiased bases

unbiased. Except for specific dimensions of the Hilbert space, the maximal sets
of MUBs are unknown in general. Even for a dimension as low as six, the
identification of a maximal set of MUBs remains an open problem, although there
is strong numerical evidence that no more than three simultaneous MUBs do
exist. Here, by exploiting a newly developed holographic technique, we
implement and test different sets of three MUBs for a single photon
six-dimensional quantum state (a qusix), encoded either in a hybrid
polarization-orbital angular momentum or a pure orbital angular momentum
Hilbert space. A close agreement is observed between theory and experiments.
Our results can find applications in state tomography, quantitative
wave-particle duality, quantum key distribution and tests on complementarity

hot X-ray coronae of early-type galaxies. By extending the investigation
carried out in Pellegrini (2011) with spherical models, we focus on the
dependence of the energy budget and temperature of the hot gas on the galaxy
structure and internal stellar kinematics. By solving the Jeans equations we
construct realistic axisymmetric three-component galaxy models (stars, dark
matter halo, central black hole) with different degrees of flattening and
rotational support. The kinematical fields are projected along different lines
of sight, and the aperture velocity dispersion is computed within a fraction of
the circularized effective radius. The model parameters are chosen so that the
models resemble real ETGs and lie on the Faber-Jackson and Size-Luminosity
relations. For these models we compute T_* (the stellar heating contribution to
the gas injection temperature) and T_gm (the temperature equivalent of the
energy required for the gas escape). In particular, different degrees of
thermalisation of the ordered rotational field of the galaxy are considered. We
find that T_* and T_gm can vary only mildly due to a pure change of shape.
Galaxy rotation instead, when not thermalised, can lead to a large decrease of
T_*; this effect can be larger in flatter galaxies that can be more
rotationally supported. Recent temperature measurements T_x, obtained with
Chandra, are larger than, but close to, the T_* values of the models, and show
a possible trend for a lower T_x in flatter and more rotationally supported
galaxies; this trend can be explained by the lack of thermalisation of the
whole stellar kinetic energy. Flat and rotating galaxies also show lower L_x
values, and then a lower gas content, but this is unlikely to be due to the
small variation of T_gm found here for them.

  We describe the interactive interpretation of a classical proof involving
real numbers. The statement we prove is a simple but non-trivial fact about
points in the real plane. The proof employs EM1 to deduce properties of the
ordering on the real numbers, which is undecidable and thus problematic from a
constructive point of view.
  We present a new set of reductions for derivations in natural deduction that
can extract witnesses from closed derivations of simply existential formulas in
HA + EM1. The reduction we present are inspired by the informal idea of
learning by making falsifiable hypothesis and checking them, and by the
interactive realizability interpretation. We extract the witnesses directly
from derivations in HA + EM1 by reduction, without encoding derivations by a
realizability interpretation.
  We give a new presentation of interactive realizability with a more explicit
syntax. We express interactive realizers by means of an abstract framework that
applies the monadic approach used in functional programming to modified
realizability, in order to obtain less strict notions of realizability that are
suitable to classical logic. In particular we use a combination of the state

Cardiff Source-finding AlgoRithm (CSAR), is introduced, which is loosely based
on CLUMPFIND, but that also generates a structure tree, or dendrogram, which
can be used to interpret hierarchical clump structure in a complex region.
Sources were extracted from the data using the hierarchical version of CSAR and
plotted on a mass-size diagram. We found a hierarchy of objects with sizes in
the range 0.024-2.7 pc. Previous studies showed that gravitationally bound
prestellar cores and unbound starless clumps appeared in different places on
the mass-size diagram. However, it was unclear whether this was due to a lack
of instrumental dynamic range or whether they were actually two distinct
populations. The excellent sensitivity of Herschel shows that our sources fill
the gap in the mass-size plane between starless and pre-stellar cores, and
gives the first clear supporting observational evidence for the theory that
unbound clumps and (gravitationally bound) prestellar cores are all part of the
same population, and hence presumably part of the same evolutionary sequence

micro-Kelvin temperatures is a striking landmark while its evidence for
semiconductor excitons still is a long-awaited milestone. This situation was
not foreseen because excitons are light-mass boson-like particles with a
condensation expected to occur around a few Kelvins. An explanation can be
found in the underlying fermionic nature of excitons which rules their
condensation. Precisely, it was recently predicted that, at accessible
experimental conditions, the exciton condensate shall be ""gray"" with a dominant
dark part coherently coupled to a weak bright component through fermion
exchanges. This counter-intuitive quantum condensation, since excitons are
mostly known for their optical activity, directly follows from the excitons
internal structure which has an optically inactive, i.e., dark, ground state.
Here, we report compelling evidence for such a ""gray"" condensate. We use an
all-optical approach in order to produce microscopic traps which confine a
dense exciton gas that yet exhibits an anomalously weak photo-emission at
sub-Kelvin temperatures. This first fingerprint for a ""gray"" condensate is then
confirmed by the macroscopic spatial coherence and the linear polarization of
the weak excitonic photoluminescence emitted from the trap, as theoretically
predicted.

focusing in particular on the choice of the coarse scale operators. Let G_c
denote the number of points per wavelength at the coarse level. If the coarse
scale solutions are to approximate the true solutions, then the oscillatory
nature of the solutions implies the requirement G_c > 2. However, in examples
the requirement is more like G_c >= 10, in a trade-off involving also the
amount of damping present and the number of multigrid iterations. We conjecture
that this is caused by the difference in phase speeds between the coarse and
fine scale operators. Standard 5-point finite differences in 2-D are our first
example. A new coarse scale 9-point operator is constructed to match the fine
scale phase speeds. We then compare phase speeds and multigrid performance of
standard schemes with a scheme using the new operator. The required G_c is
reduced from about 10 to about 3.5, with less damping present so that waves
propagate over > 100 wavelengths in the new scheme. Next we consider extensions
of the method to more general cases. In 3-D comparable results are obtained
with standard 7-point differences and optimized 27-point coarse grid operators,
leading to an order of magnitude reduction in the number of unknowns for the
coarsest scale linear system. Finally we show how to include PML boundary
layers, using a regular grid finite element method. Matching coarse scale
operators can easily be constructed for other discretizations. The method is
therefore potentially useful for a large class of discretized high-frequency
Helmholtz equations.

fundamental interest because of the mutual interaction of antagonistic kinds of
ordering at the S-F interface. Normally, the superconducting transition
temperature Tc should be strongly suppressed at the S-F interface owing to the
penetration of Cooper pairs into the ferromagnetic side. Nevertheless,
constructive interactions between S and F orders have been suggested to occur
via the modification of ferromagnetic order by the superconducting state. This
may induce an inhomogeneous magnetic state, often called a cryptoferromagnetic
state, and the relevant domain wall effect, which will lead to a local decrease
of the pair-breaking parameter. However, the domain wall effect, even if it
exists, is quite subtle from the experimental view point and is normally
difficult to observe. Here we show that the defect-related d0 ferromagnetism in
MgO and the superconductivity in MgB2 do not antagonize, but rather enhance the
superconducting transition temperature Tc to any significant degree. We found
in superconducting MgB2-d0 ferromagnetic MgO composites that the
superconducting transition proceeds in two steps. The first at the S-F
interface, between 110-120 K, then in the rest of the bulk at 39 K, which is
the Tc of single phase MgB2 superconductor. Moreover, the additional transition
emerges at 60 K at the S-F interface especially in the ferromagnetic side,
showing a spin-glass-like magnetic state. Our findings reveal that the
proximity effect in the superconductor-d0 ferromagnet heterostructures will
provide the knowledge and basis to enhance the Tc value of the existing
superconductors.

coexistence of oblate and prolate shapes in low-lying states and the transition
of ground-state from one dominate shape to another as a function of neutron
number. A detailed interpretation of these phenomena in neutron-deficient Kr
isotopes requires the use of a method going beyond a mean-field approach that
permits to determine spectra and transition probabilities. The aim of this work
is to provide a systematic calculation of low-lying state in the even-even
68-86Kr isotopes and to understand the shape coexistence phenomenon and the
onset of large collectivity around N=40 from beyond relativistic mean-field
studies. The starting point of our method is a set of relativistic
mean-field+BCS wave functions generated with a constraint on triaxial
deformations (beta, gamma). The excitation energies and electric multipole
transition strengths of low-lying states are calculated by solving a
five-dimensional collective Hamiltonian (5DCH) with parameters determined by
the mean-field wave functions. To examine the role of triaxiality, a
configuration mixing of both particle number (PN) and angular momentum (AM)
projected axially deformed states is also carried out within the exact
generator coordinate method (GCM) based on the same energy density functional.
The energy surfaces, the excitation energies of 0^+_2, 2^+_1, 2^+_2 states, as
well as the E0 and E2 transition strengths are compared with the results of
similar 5DCH calculations but with parameters determined by the
non-relativistic mean-field wave functions, as well as with the available

with the optical behaviour. This is remarkably similar to the behaviour of the

which thermodynamics applies, while equilibrium statistical mechanics does not.
A typical case is, in the words of Landau and Lifshitz, that of partial (or
incomplete) equilibrium. One has a system of interest in equilibrium with the
environment, and measures one of its quantities, for example its specific heat,
by raising the temperature of the environment. However, within the observation
time the global system settles down to a state of apparent equilibrium, so that
the measured value of the specific heat is different from the equilibrium one.
In such cases formulae for quantities such as the effective specific heat
exist, which are provided by Fluctuation Dissipation theory. However, what is
lacking is a proof that internal energy exists, i.e., that the fundamental
differential form delta Q-delta W (difference between the heat absorbed by the
system and the work performed by it) is closed. Here we show how the
coefficients of the fundamental form can be expressed in such a way that the
closure property of the form becomes manifest, so that the first principle is
proven. We then show that the second principle too follows, and indeed as a
consequence of microscopic time--reversibility. The treatment is given in a
classical Hamiltonian setting. One has a global time--independent Hamiltonian
system constituted by the system of interest and two auxiliary ones controlling
temperature and pressure, and the occurring of a process due to a change in the
thermodynamic parameters is implemented by a suitable choice of the measure for

develop a higher cutoff. Within our model, we show that the ATI cutoff extends
far beyond the semiclassical cutoff, as a function of inhomogeneity strength.

the line of sight distortion of the cross-correlation function of massive
galaxies and lower mass galaxies to estimate the gravitational redshift profile
of clusters out to 4 Mpc/h. Here we use a halo model of clustering to predict
the distortion due to gravitational redshifts of the cross-correlation function
on scales from 1 - 100 Mpc/h. We compare our predictions to simulations and use
the simulations to make mock catalogues relevant to current and future galaxy
redshift surveys. Without formulating an optimal estimator, we find that the
full BOSS survey should be able to detect gravitational redshifts from
large-scale structure at the ~4 sigma level. Upcoming redshift surveys will
greatly increase the number of galaxies useable in such studies and the BigBOSS
and Euclid experiments should be capable of measurements with precision at the
few percent level. As has been recently pointed out by McDonald, Kaiser and
Zhao et al, other interesting effects including relativistic beaming and
transverse Doppler shift can add additional asymmetric distortions to the
correlation function. While these contributions are subdominant to the
gravitational redshift on large scales, they represent additional opportunities
to probe gravitational physics and indicate that many qualitatively new
measurements should soon be possible using large redshift surveys.

rules which relate the particle one-body and two-body densities. The necessary
condition for these sum rules is that the Coulomb fluid possesses good
screening properties, i.e. the particle correlation functions or the averaged
charge inhomogeneity, say close to a wall, exhibit a short-range (usually
exponential) decay. In this work, we study equilibrium statistical mechanics of
an electric double layer with counter-ions only, i.e. a globally neutral system
of equally charged point-like particles in the vicinity of a plain hard wall
carrying a fixed uniform surface charge density of opposite sign. At large
distances from the wall, the one-body and two-body counter-ion densities go to
zero slowly according to the inverse-power law. In spite of the absence of
screening, all known sum rules are shown to hold for two exactly solvable cases
of the present system: in the weak-coupling Poisson-Boltzmann limit (in any
spatial dimension larger than one) and at a special free-fermion coupling
constant in two dimensions. This fact indicates an extended validity of the sum

high-resistivity crystalline silicon test mass as a function of optical
intensity at room temperature. The total loss from both the bulk crystal and
the surfaces was determined in a joint measurement. The characterization window
ranged from small intensities below 1W/cm^2, as planned to be used in ET, up to
21kW/cm^2. A non-linear absorption was observed for intensities above a few
kW/cm^2. In addition we have observed an intensity-independent offset that
possibly arises from absorption in the crystal surfaces. This absorption was
estimated to approx. 800 ppm/surface, which might be too high for a cryogenic
operation of a fibre-suspended silicon test mass. Such an offset was not
observed in other recent measurements that were insensitive to surface
absorption. Finally, a set of further characterization measurements is proposed
to clearly separate the contributions from the surfaces and the bulk crystal.

components emitted in M1 transition in 57Fe nuclei is modulated at first by the
magnetic field of the solar tachocline zone (due to the inverse coherent

Earth, thereby playing the role of the energy modulator of the Earth magnetic
field. Within the framework of this mechanism estimations of the strength of
the axion coupling to a photon (g_{a \gamma} = 7.07e-11 1/GeV), the
axion-nucleon coupling (g_{an} = 3.20e-7), the axion-electron coupling (g_{ae}

direct imaging has to take into account the probability of so-called
astrophysical false positives, which are phenomena that mimic the signature of
objects we are seeking. In this work we aim to present a case of a false
positive found during a direct imaging survey conducted with VLT/NACO. A
promising exoplanet candidate was detected around the K2-type star HD\,8049 in
July 2010.Its contrast of $\Delta H$=7.05 at 1.57 arcsec allowed us to guess
the presence of a 35 \MJup companion at 50 projected AU, for the nominal system
age and heliocentric distance.To check whether it was gravitationally bound to
the host star, as opposed to an unrelated background object, we re-observed the
system one year later and concluded a high probability of a bound system. We
also used radial velocity measurements of the host star, spanning a time range
of $\sim$ 30 yr, to constrain the companion's mass and orbital properties, as
well as to probe the host star's spectral age indicators and general spectral
energy distribution. We also obtained for the companion $U$-band imaging with
EFOSC and $NIR$ spectroscopy. Combining all these information we conclude that
the companion of HD\,8049 is a white dwarf (WD), with temperature
$T_{eff}=18800 \pm 2100$ K and mass $M_{WD}=0.56 \pm 0.08 M_{\odot}$. The
significant radial velocity trend coupled with the imaging data indicate that
the most probable orbit has a semimajor axis of about 50 AU.The discrepancy
between the age indicators suggested against a bona-fide young star. The
moderately large level of chromospheric activity and fast rotation, mimicking
the properties of a young star, might be induced by the exchange of mass with
the progenitor of the WD. This example demonstrates some of the challenges in
determining accurate age estimates and identifications of faint companions.

interaction with coherent intense high-frequency short laser pulses is solved
numerically exactly by propagating the single-electron wave packets. Thereby,
the wavefunction is followed in space and time for times longer than the pulse
duration. Results are explicitly shown for 3 and 10 fs pulses. Particular
attention is paid to identifying the effect of dynamic interference of
photoelectrons emitted with the same kinetic energy at different times during
the rising and falling sides of the pulse predicted in [\emph{Ph.V. Demekhin
and L.S. Cederbaum}, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{108}, 253001 (2012)]. In order to
be able to see the dynamic interference pattern in the computed electron
spectra, the photoelectron wave packet has to be propagated over long
distances. Clearly, complex absorption potentials often employed to compute
spectra of emitted particles cannot be used to detect dynamic interference. For
the considered high-frequency pulses of 3 and 10 fs durations, this requires
enormously large spatial grids. The presently computed photoionization and
above-threshold ionization spectra are found to exhibit pronounced dynamic
interference patterns. Where available, the patterns are in very good agreement
with previously published results on the photoionization spectra which have
been computed using a completely different method, thus supporting the
previously made assumption that the above-threshold ionization processes are
very weak for the considered pulse intensities and high carrier frequency. The
quiver motion in space and time of a free electron in strong laser pulses is
also investigated numerically. Finally, a discussion is presented of how fast
the atom is ionized by an intense pulse.

with the Mathematica package \SigmaP\ by discovering and proving new harmonic

frustrated lattices (the diamond chain, the dimer-plaquette chain and the

band. Eliminating high-energy degrees of freedom at high magnetic fields, we
construct low-energy effective Hamiltonians which are much simpler than the
initial ones. These effective Hamiltonians allow a more extended analytical and
numerical analysis. In addition to the standard strong-coupling perturbation
theory we also use a localized-magnon based approach leading to a substantial
improvement of the strong-coupling approximation. We perform extensive exact
diagonalization calculations to check the quality of different effective
Hamiltonians by comparison with the initial models. Based on the
effective-model description we examine the low-temperature properties of the
considered frustrated quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnets in the high-field
regime. We also apply our approach to explore thermodynamic properties for a
generalized diamond spin chain model suitable to describe azurite at high
magnetic fields. Interesting features of these highly frustrated spin models
consist in a steep increase of the entropy at very small temperatures and a
characteristic extra low-temperature peak in the specific heat. The most
prominent effect is the existence of a magnetic-field driven
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition occurring in the
two-dimensional model.

Once the equations of motion for tachyon fields related to the Born-Infeld
action are written as first-order equations, a simple analytical connection
with a particular class of real scalar field superpotentials can be found. This
equivalence leads to the conclusion that, for a certain class of
superpotentials, both systems can support identical thick brane solutions as

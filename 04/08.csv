periodically patterned with square anti-dots in nanoscale with pinned
magnetization at the edges. We show that the breaking of the mirror symmetry of
the waveguide by the structural changes can result in a magnonic band gap
closing. These intrinsic symmetry breaking can be compensated by properly
chosen asymmetric external bias magnetic field, i.e. in an extrinsic way. As a
result the magnonic gaps existing in the ideal symmetric structure can be
recovered. The model used for the explanation also suggests that this idea
could be generic both for exchange and dipolar interaction regimes of
spin-waves and also for other types of waves, e.g., electrons in the graphene
ribbons.

inverse problem. However, most studies of OAT image reconstruction still employ
two-dimensional (2D) imaging models. One important reason is because 3D image
reconstruction is computationally burdensome. The aim of this work is to
accelerate existing image reconstruction algorithms for 3D OAT by use of
parallel programming techniques.
  Methods: Parallelization strategies are proposed to accelerate a filtered
backprojection (FBP) algorithm and two different pairs of
projection/backprojection operations that correspond to two different numerical
imaging models. The algorithms are designed to fully exploit the parallel
computing power of graphic processing units (GPUs). In order to evaluate the
parallelization strategies for the projection/backprojection pairs, an
iterative image reconstruction algorithm is implemented. Computer-simulation
and experimental studies are conducted to investigate the computational
efficiency and numerical accuracy of the developed algorithms.
  Results: The GPU implementations improve the computational efficiency by
factors of 1, 000, 125, and 250 for the FBP algorithm and the two pairs of
projection/backprojection operators, respectively. Accurate images are
reconstructed by use of the FBP and iterative image reconstruction algorithms
from both computer-simulated and experimental data.
  Conclusions: Parallelization strategies for 3D OAT image reconstruction are
proposed for the first time. These GPU-based implementations significantly
reduce the computational time for 3D image reconstruction, complementing our
earlier work on 3D OAT iterative image reconstruction.

with positive probability. It is a well-understood and intuitively obvious
phenomenon that, on the survival set, the process may be pathwise decomposed
into a stochastically `thinner' Galton-Watson process, which almost surely
survives and which is decorated with immigrants, at every time step, initiating
independent copies of the original Galton-Watson process conditioned to become
extinct. The thinner process is known as the backbone and characterizes the
genealogical lines of descent of prolific individuals in the original process.
Here, prolific means individuals who have at least one descendant in every
subsequent generation to their own.
  Starting with Evans and O'Connell, there exists a cluster of literature
describing the analogue of this decomposition (the so-called backbone
decomposition) for a variety of different classes of superprocesses and
continuous-state branching processes. Note that the latter family of stochastic
processes may be seen as the total mass process of superprocesses with
non-spatially dependent branching mechanism.
  In this article we consolidate the aforementioned collection of results
concerning backbone decompositions and describe a result for a general class of
supercritical superprocesses with spatially dependent branching mechanisms. Our
approach exposes the commonality and robustness of many of the existing

controlled by the other agent's stochastic behavior for which FDM's

Invariants. When one adds a superpotential to the free theory, the extention of
the Extraordinary Invariants leads to some constraints on that superpotential.
A particularly simple solution of those constraints is based on a $3 \times 3$
matrix of nine chiral superfields, and then the superpotential is simply the
determinant of that matrix.
  It is remarkable that this same theory is also a plausible basic version of
the SUSY Standard Model for one Lepton family, and then the nine superfields
are seen to be a left (Weak) SU(2) Lepton Doublet, Two Higgs Doublets, a Right
Electron Singlet, a Right Neutrino Singlet and a Higgs singlet. Moreover, the
algebra is consistent with the notion that the other two observed Lepton
families arise from the coupling of the Extraordinary Invariants.

  Free Theories","9 pages",,,,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Extraordinary Invariants are elements of the BRST Cohomology Space which are
irrevocably dependent on Zinn sources. The existence of an Extraordinary
Invariant means that the symmetry is broken in that sector, and that the field
equations can almost rescue the invariance. Adding the Extraordinary Invariant
to the action results in a new theory with constraints on the starting theory.
So Extraordinary Invariants are seeds from which a theory can grow.
  For a simple example, it is shown in this paper how Yang Mills theory is
implicitly contained in the BRST Cohomology of Free Gauge Theory. It comes from
an Extraordinary Invariant which can be added to the free gauge action. The
Jacobi Identities are generated by requiring that the BRST Poisson Bracket be
zero.
  Since the mechanism is a general one, it can be used to construct new
theories. Some of these, for example in Supersymmetric theories, have not yet
been noticed using other methods.

possible by a recently noticed effect of a significant relative velocity

suppresses star formation, causing a unique form of early luminosity bias. The
spatial variation of this suppression enhances large-scale clustering and
produces a prominent cosmic web on 100 comoving Mpc scales in the 21-cm

astronomers to detect these early stars, and should drive a new focus on this

recently been pointed out that the moment of inertia I, the Love number lambda
and the spin-induced quadrupole moment Q of an isolated neutron star, are
related through functions which are practically independent of the equation of
state. These surprising universal I-lambda-Q relations pave the way for a
better understanding of neutron stars, most notably via gravitational-wave

and it is important to understand whether the universality of the I-lambda-Q

one specific functional direction is called lineage specification. An important
characteristic of this process is the multi-lineage priming, which requires the
simultaneous expression of lineage-specific genes. Prior to commitment to a
certain lineage, it has been observed that these genes exhibit intermediate
values of their expression levels. Multi-lineage differentiation has been
reported for various progenitor cells, and it has been explained through the
bifurcation of a metastable state. During the differentiation process the
dynamics of the core regulatory network follows a bifurcation, where the
metastable state, corresponding to the progenitor cell, is destabilized and the
system is forced to choose between the possible developmental alternatives.
While this approach gives a reasonable interpretation of the cell fate decision
process, it fails to explain the multi-lineage priming characteristic. Here, we
describe a new multi-dimensional switch-like model that captures both the
process of cell fate decision and the phenomenon of multi-lineage priming. We
show that in the symmetrical interaction case, the system exhibits a new type
of degenerate bifurcation, characterized by a critical hyperplane, containing
an infinite number of critical steady states. This critical hyperplane may be
interpreted as the support for the multi-lineage priming states of the
progenitor. Also, the cell fate decision (the multi-stability and switching
behavior) can be explained by a symmetry breaking in the parameter space of
this critical hyperplane. These analytical results are confirmed by Monte-Carlo
simulations of the corresponding chemical master equations.

  The structure theorem and the rounding scheme combine to prove the following
result, where G=(V,E) is a graph of expansion \phi(G), \lambda_k is the k-th

temperature T_D, the resistivity \rho(T) changes linearly with T, since the
mechanism, forming the T dependence of \rho(T), is the same as the
electron-phonon mechanism that prevails at high temperatures in ordinary

of one observable on a quantum state necessarily disturbs another incompatible
observable, standard uncertainty relations typically bound the indeterminacy of
the outcomes when either one or the other observable is measured. In this
paper, we quantify precisely Heisenberg's intuition. Even if two incompatible

measurement, at the price of introducing some errors with respect to the ideal
measurement of each of them. We present a new, tight relation characterizing
the optimal trade-off between the error on one observable versus the error on

Thus the event-by-event particle-ratio fluctuations could be used to study
strangeness and baryon number fluctuations near the critical point in the QCD
phase diagram. On the other hand, the study of the balance function can provide
information about charge creation time as well as the subsequent collective

results as well as multiplicity scaling properties of these fluctuation results

$d$+Au, and $p+p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV. These balance
functions are presented in terms of relative pseudorapidity, $\Delta \eta$,
relative rapidity, $\Delta y$, relative azimuthal angle, $\Delta \phi$, and

the residual term to the congestion term, eventually achieving a flow routing
the desired demands with nearly minimal congestion after
$\tilde{O}(\alpha\eps^{-2}\log^2 n)$ iterations. Our approach is similar in
spirit to that used by Spielman and Teng (STOC 2004) for solving Laplacian
systems, and we summarize our approach as trying to do for $\ell_\infty$-flows
what they do for $\ell_2$-flows.
  Together with a nearly linear time construction of a
$n^{o(1)}$-congestion-approximator, we obtain $1+\eps$-optimal single-commodity
flows undirected graphs in time $m^{1+o(1)}\eps^{-2}$, yielding the fastest
known algorithm for that problem. Our requirements of a congestion-approximator
are quite low, suggesting even faster and simpler algorithms for certain
classes of graphs. For example, an $\alpha$-competitive oblivious routing tree
meets our definition, \emph{even without knowing how to route the tree back in
the graph}. For graphs of conductance $\phi$, a trivial
$\phi^{-1}$-congestion-approximator gives an extremely simple algorithm for
finding $1+\eps$-optimal-flows in time $\tilde{O}(m\phi^{-1})$.

function $c: 2^{[n]} \rightarrow \mathbf{R}^{+}$ is a coverage function, if

and subsets $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n$ of $U$ such that $c(S) = \sum_{u \in

as non-negative linear combinations of monotone disjunctions. They are a
natural subclass of submodular functions and arise in a number of applications.
  We give an algorithm that for any $\gamma,\delta>0$, given random and uniform
examples of an unknown coverage function $c$, finds a function $h$ that
approximates $c$ within factor $1+\gamma$ on all but $\delta$-fraction of the

algorithm for learning an interesting class of functions in the demanding PMAC

structural properties of coverage functions. Using the results in (Feldman and

with excess $\ell_1$-error $\epsilon$ over all product and symmetric
distributions in time $n^{\log(1/\epsilon)}$. In contrast, we show that,
without assumptions on the distribution, learning coverage functions is at
least as hard as learning polynomial-size disjoint DNF formulas, a class of

$2^{\tilde{O}(n^{1/3})}$ (Klivans and Servedio, 2004).
  As an application of our learning results, we give simple
differentially-private algorithms for releasing monotone conjunction counting

We discuss possible phenomenological implications of such non-standard
chiral-symmetric Technicolor scenario in its simplest formulation preserving
the Standard Model (SM) Higgs mechanism. For this purpose, we assume the
existence of an extra technifermion sector confined under extra SU(3)_TC at the
energy scales reachable at the LHC, \Lambda_TC ~ 0.1-1 TeV, and interacting
with the SM gauge bosons in a chiral-symmetric (vector-like) way. In the
framework of this scenario, the SM Higgs vev acquires natural interpretation in
terms of the condensate of technifermions in confinement in the nearly
conformal limit. We study the influence of the lowest lying composite physical
states, namely, technipions, technisigma and constituent technifermions, on the
Higgs sector properties in the SM and other observables at the LHC. We found
out that the predicted Higgs boson signal strengths in \gamma\gamma,
vector-boson VV* and fermion ffbar decay channels can be sensitive to the new
strongly-coupled dynamics and are consistent with the current SM-like Higgs
boson observations in the limit of relatively small Higgs-technisigma mixing.
At the same time, the chiral-symmetric Technicolor provides us with rich
technipion phenomenology at the LHC, and its major implications are discussed
in detail.

matrix denoising scheme solves the nuclear norm penalization problem
$\operatorname {min}_X\|Y-X\|_F^2/2+\lambda\|X\|_*$, where $\|X\|_*$ denotes
the nuclear norm (sum of singular values). This is the analog, for matrices, of
$\ell_1$ penalization in the vector case. It has been empirically observed that
if $X_0$ has low rank, it may be recovered quite accurately from the noisy

number of rows $m_n$ and number of columns $n$ all tend to $\infty$
proportionally to each other ($r_n/m_n\rightarrow \rho$, $m_n/n\rightarrow

involve incomplete moments of the quarter- and semi-circle laws ($\beta=1$,

finite $m$ and $n$, we show that MSE increases as the nonzero singular values

which can be evaluated numerically, is achieved when the signal $X_0$ is
""infinitely strong."" The nuclear norm penalization problem is solved by
applying soft thresholding to the singular values of $Y$. We also derive the
minimax threshold, namely the value $\lambda^*(\rho)$, which is the optimal
place to threshold the singular values. All these results are obtained for
general (nonsquare, nonsymmetric) real matrices. Comparable results are
obtained for square symmetric nonnegative-definite matrices.

topic in numerical methods. For solving linear equations, iterative methods are
preferred over the direct methods especially when the coefficient matrix is
sparse. The rate of convergence of iteration method is increased by using
Successive Relaxation (SR) technique. But SR technique is very much sensitive
to relaxation factor, {\omega}. Recently, hybridization of classical
Gauss-Seidel based successive relaxation technique with evolutionary
computation techniques have successfully been used to solve large set of linear
equations in which relaxation factors are self-adapted. In this paper, a new
hybrid algorithm is proposed in which uniform adaptive evolutionary computation
techniques and classical Jacobi based SR technique are used instead of
classical Gauss-Seidel based SR technique. The proposed Jacobi-SR based uniform
adaptive hybrid algorithm, inherently, can be implemented in parallel
processing environment efficiently. Whereas Gauss-Seidel-SR based hybrid
algorithms cannot be implemented in parallel computing environment efficiently.
The convergence theorem and adaptation theorem of the proposed algorithm are
proved theoretically. And the performance of the proposed Jacobi-SR based
uniform adaptive hybrid evolutionary algorithm is compared with Gauss-Seidel-SR
based uniform adaptive hybrid evolutionary algorithm as well as with both

meanfield analysis we demonstrate how phase distribution evolves as we tune the
spin-orbit coupling $\gamma$ and $t$, the spin-independent hopping. For
$t>>\gamma$ we find the homogeneous superfluid phase. As we increase $\gamma$,
differences in the phases of the order parameter grows leading to twisted
superfluid phase. For $t \sim \gamma$ competing orderings in the phase
distribution is observed. At large $\gamma$ limit a Ferro-Magnetic stripe
ordering appears along the diagonal. We explain that this is due to the
frustration bought in by the spin-orbit interaction. Isolated vortex formation
is also shown to appear. We also investigate the possible collective modes. In
deep superfluid regime we derive the equation of motion for the phases
following a semi-classical approximation. Imaginary frequencies indicating the

similar, the edge-states of physical electrons are quite different. The single
electron excitation of the former shows a free particle-like behavior while the
latter one is gapped, which provides a definite signature to identify the
fractionalized states. The transition between these two phases is found to fall
into the 3D Ising universal class. Significantly, near the quantum transition
point the physical electron in the edge-states shows strong Luttinger liquid
behavior. An extension to the interesting case of the square lattice is also
made. In addition, we also discuss some relationship between our exactly
soluble model and various Hubbard-like models existing in the literature. The
essential difference between the proposed $Z_{2}$ fractionalized Chern
insulator and the hotly pursued fractional Chern insulator is also pointed out.

years because it can achieve diversity gain in wireless networks. In existing
works, network coding and two-path relay are adopted to deal with the increase
of network size and the half-duplex nature of relay, respectively. To further
improve bandwidth efficiency, we propose a novel cooperative transmission
scheme which combines network coding and two-path relay together in a
multi-source system. Due to the utilization of two-path relay, our proposed
scheme achieves full-rate transmission. Adopting complex field network coding
(CFNC) at both sources and relays ensures that symbols from different sources
are allowed to be broadcast in the same time slot. We also adopt physical-layer
network coding (PNC) at relay nodes to deal with the inter-relay interference
caused by the two-path relay. With careful process design, the ideal throughput
of our scheme achieves by 1 symbol per source per time slot (sym/S/TS).
Furthermore, the theoretical analysis provides a method to estimate the symbol
error probability (SEP) and throughput in additive complex white Gaussian noise
(AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channels. The simulation results verify the
improvement achieved by the proposed scheme.

addressing in high spectral resolution conquers the thermal broadening

optimum number of cycles of electric field within the range zero to $\sim$1.0

obtain that the dynamical barrier scales as $ B_{eq}(L)= c L+L^{1/2} u$ where
$u$ is a Gaussian random variable of non-zero-mean. While the non-random term
scaling as $L$ corresponds to the energy-cost of the creation of a system-size

barriers for the motion of the system-size domain-wall after its creation. This
scaling corresponds to the dynamical exponent $\psi=1/2$, in agreement with the

conduction band resonantly excites an electron in the valence band, and vice
versa, leading to oscillatory exchange of electronic population between two
distinct electronic states that lives for up to tens of picoseconds. The
oscillatory structure is reminiscent of beating patterns between quantum states
and is strongly suggestive of the presence of long-lived molecular electronic
coherence. Significantly, however, a detailed analysis of the electronic
coherence properties shows that the oscillatory structure arises from a purely
incoherent process. These results were obtained by propagating the coupled
dynamics of electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom in a mixed
quantum-classical study of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Hamiltonian for
polyacetylene. The incoherent process is shown to occur between degenerate
electronic states with distinct electronic configurations that are indirectly
coupled via a third auxiliary state by the vibronic interactions. A discussion

0.0003 AU and with a period of 1.3541 days. The planetary parameters have been
robustly determined using a simultaneous fit of the HATSouth,
MPG/ESO~2.2\,m/GROND, Faulkes Telescope South/Spectral transit photometry and
MPG/ESO~2.2\,m/FEROS, Euler~1.2\,m/CORALIE, AAT~3.9\,m/CYCLOPS radial-velocity
measurements. HATS-2b has a mass of 1.37 \pm 0.16 M_J, a radius of 1.14 \pm
0.03 R_J and an equilibrium temperature of 1567 \pm 30 K. The host star has a
mass of 0.88 \pm 0.04 M_Sun, radius of 0.89 \pm 0.02 R_Sun and shows starspot
activity. We characterized the stellar activity by analysing two photometric
follow-up transit light curves taken with the GROND instrument, both obtained
simultaneously in four optical bands (covering the wavelength range of
3860-9520 \AA). The two light curves contain anomalies compatible with
starspots on the photosphere of the parent star along the same transit chord.

for the underlying forward price $(F_t)_{t \geq 0}$, we assume that call prices
for maturities $T_0<T_1$ are given and hence that the marginal laws of the
underlying are known. The primal problem is to find the model which is
consistent with the observed call prices, and for which the price of the
forward starting straddle is minimised. The dual problem is to find the
cheapest semi-static subhedge.
  Under an assumption on the supports of the marginal laws, but no assumption

route connecting some pick-up points for a taxi driver so that he/she is more
likely to get passengers with less travel cost. Essentially, a key challenge of
this problem is its high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a
dynamical programming based method to solve this problem. Our method consists
of two separate stages: an offline pre-processing stage and an online search
stage. The offline stage pre-computes optimal potential sequence candidates
from a set of pick-up points, and the online stage selects the optimal driving
route based on the pre-computed sequences with the current position of an empty
taxi. Specifically, for the offline pre-computation, a backward incremental
sequence generation algorithm is proposed based on the iterative property of
the cost function. Simultaneously, an incremental pruning policy is adopted in
the process of sequence generation to reduce the search space of the potential
sequences effectively. In addition, a batch pruning algorithm can also be
applied to the generated potential sequences to remove the non-optimal ones of
a certain length. Since the pruning effect continuously increases with the
increase of the sequence length, our method can search the optimal driving
route efficiently in the remaining potential sequence candidates. Experimental
results on real and synthetic data sets show that the pruning percentage of our
method is significantly improved compared to the state-of-the-art methods,
which makes our method can be used to handle the problem of mobile sequential
recommendation with more pick-up points and to search the optimal driving
routes in arbitrary length ranges.

correlated activity by neurons transmitting common fluctuations due to shared
inputs. This, however, overestimates correlations. Recently the recurrent
connectivity of cortical networks was shown responsible for the observed low
baseline correlations. Two different explanations were given: One argues that
excitatory and inhibitory population activities closely follow the external
inputs to the network, so that their effects on a pair of cells mutually
cancel. Another explanation relies on negative recurrent feedback to suppress
fluctuations in the population activity, equivalent to small correlations. In a
biological neuronal network one expects both, external inputs and recurrence,
to affect correlated activity. The present work extends the theoretical
framework of correlations to include both contributions and explains their
qualitative differences. Moreover the study shows that the arguments of fast
tracking and recurrent feedback are not equivalent, only the latter correctly
predicts the cell-type specific correlations.

if the period change of WY Cancri can originate from the angular momentum loss.
In calculation, we assume that this source has a high wind loss rate of

braking demands a strong surface magnetic field of $\gtrsim 10000$ G like Ap/Bp

based on the first data available from the CALIFA survey (150 galaxies). This
survey provides integral field spectroscopy of the complete optical extent of
each galaxy (up to 2-3 effective radii), with enough resolution to separate
individual HII regions and/or aggregations. Nearly $\sim$3000 individual HII
regions have been detected. The spectra cover the wavelength range between
[OII]3727 and [SII]6731, with a sufficient signal-to-noise to derive the oxygen
abundance and star-formation rate associated with each region. In addition, we
have computed the integrated and spatially resolved stellar masses (and surface
densities), based on SDSS photometric data. We explore the relations between
the stellar mass, oxygen abundance and star-formation rate using this dataset.
  We derive a tight relation between the integrated stellar mass and the
gas-phase abundance, with a dispersion smaller than the one already reported in
the literature ($\sigma_{\Delta{\rm log(O/H)}}=$0.07 dex). Indeed, this
dispersion is only slightly larger than the typical error derived for our
oxygen abundances. However, we do not find any secondary relation with the
star-formation rate, other than the one induced due to the primary relation of
this quantity with the stellar mass. We confirm the result using the $\sim$3000
individual HII regions, for the corresponding local relations.
  Our results agree with the scenario in which gas recycling in galaxies, both
locally and globally, is much faster than other typical timescales, like that
of gas accretion by inflow and/or metal loss due to outflows. In essence,
late-type/disk dominated galaxies seem to be in a quasi-steady situation, with
a behavior similar to the one expected from an instantaneous
recycling/closed-box model.

the actual play of the game, where players can make binding offers for transfer

recipient playing the strategy indicated in the offer. Such offers transform
the payoff matrix of the original game but preserve its non-cooperative nature.
The type of offers we focus on here are conditional on a suggested 'matching
offer' of the same kind made in return by the receiver. Players can exchange a
series of such offers, thus engaging in a bargaining process before a strategic
normal form game is played.
  In this paper we study and analyze solution concepts for two-player normal
form games with such preplay negotiation phase, under several assumptions for
the bargaining power of the players, such as the possibility of withdrawing
previously made offers and opting out from the negotiation process, as well as
the value of time for the players in such negotiations. We obtain results
describing the possible solutions of such bargaining games and analyze the
degrees of efficiency and fairness that can be achieved in such negotiation

lensing Minkowski Functionals (MFs). We consider actual sky masks used for a
Subaru Suprime-Cam imaging survey. The masks increase the variance of the
convergence field and the expected values of the MFs are biased. The bias then
affects the non-Gaussian signals induced by the gravitational growth of
structure. We then explore how masks affect cosmological parameter estimation.
We calculate the cumulative signal-to-noise ratio S/N for masked maps to study
the information content of lensing MFs. We show that the degradation of S/N for
masked maps is mainly determined by the effective survey area. We also perform
simple chi^2 analysis to show the impact of lensing MF bias due to masked
regions. Finally, we compare ray-tracing simulations with data from a Subaru 2
deg^2 survey in order to address if the observed lensing MFs are consistent
with those of the standard cosmology. The resulting chi^2/n_dof = 29.6/30 for
three combined MFs, obtained with the mask effects taken into account, suggests
that the observational data are indeed consistent with the standard LambdaCDM

However, for an arbitrary number of genomes related by a binary phylogenetic

sequence generated according to a different pmf and modify it in such a way to
induce a decision error. P_X is known only through one or more training
sequences. We derive the asymptotic equilibrium of the game under the
assumption that the analyst relies only on first order statistics of the test
sequence, and compute the asymptotic payoff of the game when the length of the
test sequence tends to infinity. We introduce the concept of
indistinguishability region, as the set of pmf's that can not be distinguished
reliably from P_X in the presence of attacks. Two different scenarios are
considered: in the first one the analyst and the adversary share the same
training sequence, in the second scenario, they rely on independent sequences.
The obtained results are compared to a version of the game in which the pmf P_X

models, which gives the motion equation (3.19). We calculate here the action
and the equations of motion for some 6-dimensionals Manin triples and we give a

triples are (sl(2; C) sl(2; C) ; sl(2; C); sl(2; C)),(sl(2; C) sl(2; C) ; sl(2;
C)); sl(2; C),(sl(2; C); su(2; C); sb(2; C)) and (sl(2; C); sb(2; C); su(2;

complex object-oriented data structures and operations on these data, into a
description of relational structures and operations on them. The proposed
approach makes possible to extend the target relational language with commands
allowing data be described as a set of complex persistent objects of different

applied to the data of complex objects. It is shown that any operation and

relations as scalar domains, in referential integrity constraints and in data

topology searches for supersymmetry (SUSY) from the CMS experiment, and use
this to determine universal mass limits on gluino and third-generation squarks
in the context of Natural-like SUSY spectra. The class of Natural-like SUSY
spectra considered follows the typical Natural SUSY model made up of a gluino,
third-generation squarks, and higgsino sparticles, but is extended to more
complex spectra containing sleptons. We show that the limits obtained from the
combination of inclusive topology searches are far more stable than those from
individual searches, with respect to the assumed underlying complexity of the
spectra. Hence, these limits can be considered as universal mass limits on
gluino and third-generation squarks, defined in the context of this broad class
of Natural-like SUSY spectra. Furthermore, we present our results using a
simple colour scheme that allows a straightforward interpretation of any
Natural-like SUSY spectrum with our limits.
  Complementing the final results of the 2011 searches based on 5
$\textrm{fb}^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity, with the first published results
from the 2012 searches using approximately 11 $\textrm{fb}^{-1}$, we find that
gluinos with a mass of $m_{\tilde{g}}\approx$ 1050 GeV and third-generation top
and bottom squarks with masses of $m_{\tilde{3G}}\approx$ 575 GeV are excluded
for low masses of the lightest SUSY particle (LSP). We also establish a
prediction of how these limits might evolve when the full 2012 data set is
analysed, with both the CMS and ATLAS experiments combined. The importance of
combining relevant inclusive topology searches, in order to make the most
universal interpretations possible, is a general recommendation for future
experimental searches at the LHC.

features: (1) it allows the set of active variables to vary across quantiles,
thus making it more flexible to accommodate heterogeneity; (2) it is model-free
and avoids the difficult task of specifying the form of a statistical model in
a high dimensional space. Our nonlinear independence screening procedure
employs spline approximations to model the marginal effects at a quantile level
of interest. Under appropriate conditions on the quantile functions without
requiring the existence of any moments, the new procedure is shown to enjoy the
sure screening property in ultra-high dimensions. Furthermore, the
quantile-adaptive framework can naturally handle censored data arising in
survival analysis. We prove that the sure screening property remains valid when
the response variable is subject to random right censoring. Numerical studies
confirm the fine performance of the proposed method for various semiparametric
models and its effectiveness to extract quantile-specific information from
heteroscedastic data.

two-time, response-excitation moment equations for a nonlinear dynamical system
excited by colored, Gaussian or non-Gaussian processes. Starting from equations
for the two-time moments (e.g. for Cxy(t,s), Cxx(t,s)), the method uses an
exact time-closure condition, in addition to a Gaussian moment closure, in
order to obtain a closed, non-local in time (causal) subsystem for the one-time
(t=s) moments. After solving this causal system, the two-time moments can be
calculated for all (t,s) pairs as well. The present method differs essentially
from the classical It\^o/FPK approach since it does not involve any specific
assumptions regarding the correlation structure of the excitation. In the case
where the input random process can be obtained as the solution of an It\^o
equation (as, e.g., happens with an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process), the proposed
non-local system is localized, leading to moment equations identical with the
usual ones. The closed, non-local in time, moment system is numerically solved
by means of an appropriate, two-scale, iterative scheme, and numerical results
are presented for two families of colored stochastic excitations. The results
are confirmed by means of extensive Monte Carlo simulations. It is found that
both the correlation time and the details of the shape of the input random
function affect appreciable the response covariance. In the present paper we
focus on a monostable cubic half-oscillator, excited by a smoothly-correlated,
linear-plus-cubic-Gaussian (non-Gaussian) random input. The bistable case, as
well as more general nonlinear systems can be treated by the same method,
provided that a more elaborate moment closure will be used.

access to entangled pairs of photons with very high angular momenta, in which

Universe, but the sample of targets well understood from an asteroseismological
point of view is still too limited to provide feedback on the current
evolutionary models. Our study extends this sample with two spectroscopic
binary systems. AIMS. Our goal is to provide orbital solutions, fundamental
parameters and abundances from disentangled high-resolution high
signal-to-noise spectra, as well as to analyse and interpret the variations in
the Kepler light curve of these carefully selected targets. This way we
continue our efforts to map the instability strips of beta Cep and SPB stars
using the combination of high-resolution ground-based spectroscopy and
uninterrupted space-based photometry. Methods: We fit Keplerian orbits to
radial velocities measured from selected absorption lines of high-resolution
spectroscopy using synthetic composite spectra to obtain orbital solutions. We
use revised masks to obtain optimal light curves from the original pixel-data
from the Kepler satellite, which provided better long term stability compared
to the pipeline processed light curves. We use various time-series analysis
tools to explore and describe the nature of variations present in the light
curve. Results: We find two eccentric double-lined spectroscopic binary systems
containing a total of three main sequence B-type stars (and one F-type
component) of which at least one in each system exhibits light variations. The
light curve analysis (combined with spectroscopy) of the system of two B stars
points towards the presence of tidally excited g modes in the primary
component. We interpret the variations seen in the second system as classical g
mode pulsations driven by the kappa mechanism in the B type primary, and
explain the unexpected power in the p mode region as a result of nonlinear
resonant mode excitation.

external force is instantly removed from a small charged particle, the field in
its close neighborhood becomes a Lorentz boosted Coulomb field. It suggests
that the force of the self-field on the particle should instantaneously vanish
after a sudden removal of the external force. A minimal modification of
Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac equation is searched seeking to implement this property.
A term assuring this behavior is added to the equation by maintaining Lorentz
covariance and vanishing scalar product with the four-velocity. The simple
Dirac constant force example does not show runaway acceleration.

history in their formation. In the present work, we report new interferometric
observations of the HDO 4 2,2 - 4 2,3 line for two solar type protostars,
IRAS2A and IRAS4A, located in the NGC1333 region. In both sources, the detected
HDO emission originates from a central compact unresolved region. Comparison
with previously published interferometric observations of the H218$O 3 1,3 - 2
2,0 line shows that the HDO and H$_2$O lines mostly come from the same region.
A non-LTE LVG analysis of the HDO and H218$O line emissions, combined with
published observations, provides a [HDO]/[H2O] ratio of 0.3 - 8 % in IRAS2A and
0.5 - 3 % in IRAS4A.
  First, the water fractionation is lower than that of other molecules such as
formaldehyde and methanol in the same sources. Second, it is similar to that
measured in the solar type protostar prototype, IRAS16293-2422, and,
surprisingly enough, larger than that measured in NGC1333 IRAS4B. {The
comparison of the measured values towards IRAS2A and IRAS4A with the
predictions of our gas-grain model GRAINOBLE gives similar conclusions to those
for IRAS 16293, arguing that these protostars {share} a similar chemical

solutions within such approximation to be a necessary requirement of the sum
rule. For a range of values of the coupling constant, these solutions manifest
themselves as a physical bound state and a $K$-matrix pole. For another domain
however, they appear as tachyon solutions, showing the inconsistency of the
approximation in this region.

elementary algebras to left Artinian algebras over a field $k$ when it is
splitting over its radical, in particular, when the dimension of the quotient
algebra decided by the $n$'th Hochschild cohomology is less than 2 (for
example, $k$ is finite or char$k=0$). Using generalized path algebras, the
generalized Gabriel's Theorem is given for finite dimensional algebras with
2-nilpotent radicals which is splitting over its radical. As a tool, the
so-called pseudo path algebras are introduced as a new generalization of path
algebras, which can cover generalized path algebras (see Fact 2.5).
  The main result is that (i) for a left Artinian $k$-algebra $A$ and $r=r(A)$
the radical of $A$, when the quotient algebra $A/r$ can be lifted, it holds
that $A\cong PSE_k(\Delta,\mathcal{A},\rho)$ with $J^{s}\subset<\rho>\subset J$
for some $s$ (Theorem 3.2); (ii) for a finite dimensional $k$-algebra $A$ with
$r=r(A)$ 2-nilpotent radical, when the quotient algebra $A/r$ can be lifted, it
holds that $A\cong k(\Delta,\mathcal{A},\rho)$ with $\widetilde
J^{2}\subset<\rho>\subset\widetilde J^{2}+\widetilde J\cap$

of $A$ and $\rho$ is a set of relations.
  Meantime, the uniqueness of the quivers and generalized path algebra/pseudo
path algebras satisfying the isomorphism relations is obtained in the case when
the ideals generated by the relations are admissible (see Theorem 3.5 and 4.4).

for any density of the bath particles, the fluctuations of the TP position and
their correlations with the occupation number of the bath particles. We obtain
an exact Einstein-type relation which links these fluctuations in the absence
of a driving force and the bath particles density profiles in the linear
driving regime. For the one-dimensional case we also provide an approximate but
very accurate explicit expression for the variance of the TP position and show
that it can be a non-monotoneous function of the bath particles density:
counter-intuitively, an increase of the density may increase the dispersion of
the TP position. We show that this non trivial behavior, which could in

variables, we derive large deviation estimates for the tail of the interference

family of $\beta$-Ginibre processes is formed by determinantal point processes,
with different degree of repulsiveness, which converge in law to a homogeneous
Poisson process, as $\beta \to 0$. In this sense the Poisson network model may
be considered as the limiting uncorrelated case of the $\beta$-Ginibre network
model. Our results indicate the existence of two different regimes. When the
fading random variables are bounded or Weibull superexponential, large values
of the interference are typically originated by the sum of several equivalent
interfering contributions due to nodes in the vicinity of the receiver.
  In this case, the tail of the interference has, on the log-scale, the same
asymptotic behavior for any value of $0<\beta\le 1$, but it differs (again on a
log-scale) from the asymptotic behavior of the tail of the interference in the
Poisson network model.
  When the fading random variables are exponential or subexponential, instead,
large values of the interference are typically originated by a single
dominating interferer node and, on the log-scale, the asymptotic behavior of
the tail of the interference is essentially insensitive to the distribution of
the nodes. As a consequence, on the log-scale, the asymptotic behavior of the
tail of the interference in any $\beta$-Ginibre network model, $0<\beta\le 1$,
is the same as in the Poisson network model.

which an X-ray flare, due to the tidal disruption of a star by the massive
black hole in the center of the galaxy, was detected by the RASS in 1990-91.
Here we present analysis of late-time follow-up observations of NGC 5905 using
Chandra, Spitzer VLA 3 GHz and 8 GHz archival data and GMRT 1.28 GHz radio
observations. The X-ray image shows no compact source that could be associated
with an AGN. Instead, the emission is extended -- likely due to nuclear star
formation and the total measured X-ray luminosity is comparable to the X-ray
luminosity determined from the 2002 Chandra observations. Diffuse X-ray
emission was detected close to the circum-nuclear star forming ring. The
Spitzer 2006 mid-infrared spectrum also shows strong evidence of nuclear star
formation but no clear AGN signatures. The semi-analytical models of Tommasin
et. al. 2010 together with the measured [OIV]/[NeII] line ratio suggest that at
most only 5.6% of the total IR Flux at 19 $\mu$m is being contributed by the
AGN. The GMRT 1.28 GHz observations reveal a nuclear source. In the much higher
resolution VLA 3 GHz map, the emission has a double lobed structure of size
2.7'' due to the circumnuclear star forming ring. The GMRT 1.28 GHz peak
emission coincides with the center of the circumnuclear ring. We did not detect
any emission in the VLA 8 GHz (1996) archival data. The 3 $\sigma$ upper limits
for the radio afterglow of the TDE at 1.28 GHz, 3 GHz and 8 GHz are 0.17 mJy,
0.09 mJy and 0.09 mJy, respectively. Our studies thus show that (i) NGC 5905
has a declining X-ray flux consistent with a TDE, (ii) the IR flux is dominated
by nuclear star formation, (iii) the nuclear radio emission observed from the
galaxy is due to circumnuclear star formation, (iv) no compact radio emission
associated with a radio afterglow from the TDE is detected.

  We show that every valuation profile admits a CWE that obtains at least half
of the optimal (unconstrained) social welfare. Moreover, we devise a poly-time
algorithm that, given an arbitrary allocation X, computes a CWE that achieves
at least half of the welfare of X. Thus, the economic problem of finding a CWE
with high social welfare reduces to the algorithmic problem of social-welfare
approximation. In addition, we show that every valuation profile admits a CWE
that extracts a logarithmic fraction of the optimal welfare as revenue.
Finally, these results are complemented by strong lower bounds when the seller
is restricted to using item prices only, which motivates the use of bundles.
The strength of our results derives partly from their generality - our results
hold for arbitrary valuations that may exhibit complex combinations of
substitutes and complements.

ELM types - embraces substantially different ELMing processes. By quantifying
the structure in the sequence of inter-ELM time intervals using delay time

transitions between distinct underlying physical processes. The control
parameter for these transitions between these different ELMing processes is the

experimental results. It is straightforward to find a formula for the velocity
v of the moving system required to produce causality violation. This formula
typically yields a velocity very close to the speed of light (for instance, v/c
> 0.97 for X-shaped microwaves), which raises some doubts about the real
physical observability of the violations. We then compute the velocity
requirement introducing a delay between the reception of the primary signal and
the emission of the secondary. It turns out that in principle for any delay it
is possible to find moving observers able to produce active causal violation.
This is mathematically due to the singularity of the Lorentz transformations
for beta to 1. For a realistic delay due to the propagation of a luminal
precursor, we find that causality violations in the reported experiments are
still more unlikely (v/c > 0.989), and even in the hypothesis that the
superluminal propagation velocity goes to infinity, the velocity requirement is
bounded by v/c > 0.62. We also prove that if two macroscopic bodies exchange
energy and momentum through superluminal signals, then the swap of signal
source and target is incompatible with the Lorentz transformations; therefore
it is not possible to distinguish between source and target, even with
reference to a definite reference frame.

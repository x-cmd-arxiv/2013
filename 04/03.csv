on the quadratic fluctuations of intensive observables of statistical
mechanical systems in terms of the Bogoliubov - Duhamel inner product and some
thermal average values. It was shown that several well-known inequalities in
equilibrium statistical mechanics emerge as special cases of these results. On
the basis of the spectral representation, lower and upper bounds on the
one-sided fidelity susceptibility were derived in analogous terms. Here, these
results are reviewed and presented in a unified manner. In addition, the
spectral representation of the symmetric two-sided fidelity susceptibility is
derived, and it is shown to coincide with the one-sided case. Therefore, both
definitions imply the same lower and upper bounds on the fidelity
susceptibility.

emission in published catalogs. An analysis of the optical images confirms that
this is a massive cluster, with a dominant central galaxy (the BCG) and an
accompanying red sequence of galaxies, plus a $14''$-long strong lensing arc.
Longslit pectroscopy of 6 cluster members shows that the cluster is at
$z=0.516\pm0.002$. We also targeted the strongly lensed arc, and found $z_{\rm
arc}=1.601$. We use LensTool to carry out a strong lensing analysis, from which
we measure a median Einstein radius $\theta_E(z_s=1.6)\simeq30''$ and estimate
an enclosed mass $M_E=2.45_{-0.47}^{+0.45}\times10^{14}\,M_\odot$. By
extrapolating an NFW profile we find a total mass
$M_{500}^{SL}=4.0_{-1.0}^{+2.1}\times10^{14}M_\odot$. Including a constraint on
the mass from previous X-ray observations yields a slightly higher mass,

with the value from strong lensing alone. High-resolution radio images from
TGSS at 150~MHz reveal that PLCK G004.5$-$19.5 hosts a powerful radio relic on
scales $\lesssim500$ kpc. Emission at the same location is also detected in low

indications that the Crab arose from a sub-energetic explosion of an 8-10 Msun
star, this appears to conflict with the high luminosity indicated by historical
observations. This paper shows that several properties of the Crab are best
suited to Type IIn-P explosions (Type IIn spectra with plateau light curves).
These events probably arise from relatively low-energy (1e50 erg) explosions
with low 56Ni yield resulting from electron-capture SNe (ecSNe), but their high
luminosity and Type IIn spectra are dominated by shock interaction with CSM.
After about 120 days, nearly all of the mass in the CSM and ejecta ends up in a
slow dense shell. In the scenario proposed here for SN1054, this thin shell is
accelerated by the growing pulsar wind nebula, producing the complex network of
filaments seen today. There is no need to invoke the invisible fast SN envelope
hypothesized to reside outside the Crab. SNeIIn-P explain several observed
features of the Crab: (1) No blast wave or rapidly expanding SN envelope
outside the filaments, (2) a total mass of 5 Msun swept up in a thin shell, (3)
a high peak luminosity despite the low kinetic energy, and (4) chemical
abundances consistent with an 8-10 Msun star and low 56Ni yield. A number of
other implications are discussed, concerning other Crab-like remnants, dust in
the Crab filaments, diversity in the initial masses of SNe IIn, and an
association between ecSNe and SN impostors. This model predicts that if light
echoes from SN1054 are discovered, they will be consistent with a Type IIn-P
spectrum.

that structures and dynamics at the time of maximum dissipation depend on the
large scale initial conditions. This is evident in particular from the fact
that each flow has a different shape for the joint PDF of the invariants of the
velocity gradient in contrast to the universal teardrop shape of hydrodynamic
turbulence. The general picture that emerges from the analysis of the
invariants is that regions of high vorticity are correlated with regions of
high strain rate $\bm S$ also in contrast to hydrodynamic turbulent flows.
Magnetic strain dominated regions are also well correlated with region of high
current density $\bm j$. Viscous dissipation ($\propto \bm S^2$) as well as
Ohmic dissipation ($\propto \bm j^2$) reside in regions where strain and

underwater acoustic arrays with an instrumented volume of the order of 100 km^3

evolve when neutrinos interact with nuclei in water, and can be detected over

optically thin plasma. In our snap-shot 240/610 MHz GMRT observations, most of
the Seyfert galaxies show primarily an unresolved central radio component,

and the helicity-0 graviton necessarily have a negative kinetic term at short
distances, making this background unphysical. In addition, these cosmologies
exhibit an order one sensitivity to higher dimensional terms suppressed by an
energy scale that is parametrically higher than the strong coupling scale of
the quasidilaton effective theory: such terms include Galileons, Goldstone-like
selfinteractions and derivatives of the quasidilaton coupled to curvature, none
of which introduce extra Ostrogradsky states. As one consequence, cosmology at
the Hubble distances for this particular class of solutions depends on an
unknown extension of the quasidilaton below its strong coupling distance scale.
We note that non-FRW solutions that are similar to those of pure massive
gravity should not necessarily suffer from these pathologies.

submodular functions over the uniform distribution on the Boolean hypercube
$\{0,1\}^n$. Our main result is the following structural theorem: any
submodular function is $\epsilon$-close in $\ell_2$ to a real-valued decision
tree (DT) of depth $O(1/\epsilon^2)$. This immediately implies that any
submodular function is $\epsilon$-close to a function of at most
$2^{O(1/\epsilon^2)}$ variables and has a spectral $\ell_1$ norm of
$2^{O(1/\epsilon^2)}$. It also implies the closest previous result that states
that submodular functions can be approximated by polynomials of degree
$O(1/\epsilon^2)$ (Cheraghchi et al., 2012). Our result is proved by
constructing an approximation of a submodular function by a DT of rank
$4/\epsilon^2$ and a proof that any rank-$r$ DT can be $\epsilon$-approximated
by a DT of depth $\frac{5}{2}(r+\log(1/\epsilon))$.
  We show that these structural results can be exploited to give an
attribute-efficient PAC learning algorithm for submodular functions running in
time $\tilde{O}(n^2) \cdot 2^{O(1/\epsilon^{4})}$. The best previous algorithm
for the problem requires $n^{O(1/\epsilon^{2})}$ time and examples (Cheraghchi
et al., 2012) but works also in the agnostic setting. In addition, we give
improved learning algorithms for a number of related settings.
  We also prove that our PAC and agnostic learning algorithms are essentially
optimal via two lower bounds: (1) an information-theoretic lower bound of
$2^{\Omega(1/\epsilon^{2/3})}$ on the complexity of learning monotone
submodular functions in any reasonable model; (2) computational lower bound of
$n^{\Omega(1/\epsilon^{2/3})}$ based on a reduction to learning of sparse
parities with noise, widely-believed to be intractable. These are the first
lower bounds for learning of submodular functions over the uniform
distribution.

Indeed, the primary purpose of this chapter is to describe in detail, the

coupled with magnetization dynamics and to show how it was benchmarked against

  We address non-collinear spin-transport in Section-2 using a lumped

non-collinear magnets (required for modeling spin torque), by computing
4-component currents and voltages at every node of a ""circuit"". For modeling

torque. Section-3 describes how this LLG model is coupled with the spin

to prove that the signature series of a class of simple non-smooth curves

supernovae (SNe) are perhaps the best-studied class of SNe, yet the progenitor
systems of these explosions largely remain a mystery. A rare subclass of SNe Ia
show evidence of strong interaction with their circumstellar medium (CSM), and
in particular, a hydrogen-rich CSM; we refer to them as SNe Ia-CSM. In the
first systematic search for such systems, we have identified 16 SNe Ia-CSM, and
here we present new spectra of 13 of them. Six SNe Ia-CSM have been
well-studied previously, three were previously known but are analyzed in-depth
for the first time here, and seven are new discoveries from the Palomar
Transient Factory. The spectra of all SNe Ia-CSM are dominated by H{\alpha}
emission (with widths of ~2000 km/s) and exhibit large H{\alpha}/H{\beta}
intensity ratios (perhaps due to collisional excitation of hydrogen via the SN
ejecta overtaking slower-moving CSM shells); moreover, they have an almost
complete lack of He I emission. They also show possible evidence of dust
formation through a decrease in the red wing of H{\alpha} 75-100 d past maximum
brightness, and nearly all SNe Ia-CSM exhibit strong Na I D absorption from the
host galaxy. The absolute magnitudes (uncorrected for host-galaxy extinction)
of SNe Ia-CSM are found to be -21.3 <= M_R <= -19 mag, and they also seem to
show ultraviolet emission at early times and strong infrared emission at late
times (but no detected radio or X-ray emission). Finally, the host galaxies of
SNe Ia-CSM are all late-type spirals similar to the Milky Way, or dwarf
irregulars like the Large Magellanic Cloud, which implies that these objects
come from a relatively young stellar population. This work represents the most
detailed analysis of the SN Ia-CSM class to date.

density fluctuations in agreement with results from the numerical simulations,
we introduce a probability conditional formalism (CF) based on an inventory of
isolated overdense regions in a density random field. This formalism is a
useful tool for describing at the same time the mass function (MF) of dark
haloes, their mass aggregation histories (MAHs) and merging rates (MRs). The CF
focuses on virialized regions in a self-consistent way rather than in mass
elements, and it offers an economical description for a variety of random
fields. Within the framework of the CF, we confirm that, for a Gaussian field,
it is not possible to reproduce at the same time the MF, MAH, and MR of haloes,
both for a constant and moving barrier. Then, we develop an inductive method
for constraining the cumulative conditional probability from a given halo MF
description, and thus, using the CF, we calculate the halo MAHs and MRs. By
applying this method to the MF measured in numerical simulations by Tinker et
al. 2008, we find that a reasonable solution, justified by a mass conservation
argument, is obtained if ones introduce a rescaling -increment by ~30% - of the
virial mass used in simulations and a (slight) deviation from Gaussianity.
Thus, both the MAH and MR obtained by a Monte Carlo merger tree agree now with
the predictions of numerical simulations. We discuss on the necessity of
rescaling the virial mass in simulations when comparing with analytical
approaches on the ground of the matter not accounted as part of the halos and
the halo mass limit due to numerical. Our analysis supports the presence of a
diffuse dark matter component that is not taken into account in the measured
halo MFs inasmuch as it is not part of the collapsed structures.

and incorporate neutrino data via an inverse seesaw mechanism. Also in this
restricted model, the additional D terms can rise the light Higgs mass in a
sizable way. Therefore, it is much easier to obtain m_h \simeq 125 GeV without
the need to push the supersymmetry spectrum to extremely large values as it
happens in models with minimal supersymmetric standard model particle content

investigate the environments of a large sample of obscured and unobscured
luminous radio-loud AGN at 1.2 < z < 3.2. These data, obtained for 387 fields,
reach 3.6 and 4.5 um depths of [3.6] (AB) = 22.6 and [4.5] (AB) = 22.9 at the
95% completeness level, which is two to three times fainter than L* in this
redshift range. By using the color cut [3.6]-[4.5] > -0.1 (AB), which
efficiently selects high-redshift (z > 1.3) galaxies of all types, we identify
galaxy cluster member candidates in the fields of the radio-loud AGN. The local
density of these IRAC-selected sources is compared to the density of similarly
selected sources in blank fields. We find that 92% of the radio-loud AGN reside
in environments richer than average. The majority (55%) of the radio-loud AGN
fields are found to be overdense at a > 2 {\sigma} level; 10% are overdense at
a > 5 {\sigma} level. A clear rise in surface density of IRAC-selected sources
towards the position of the radio-loud AGN strongly supports an association of
the majority of the IRAC-selected sources with the radio-loud AGN. Our results
provide solid statistical evidence that radio-loud AGN are likely beacons for
finding high-redshift galaxy (proto-)clusters. We investigate how environment
depends on AGN type (unobscured radio-loud quasars vs. obscured radio
galaxies), radio luminosity and redshift, finding no correlation with either
AGN type or radio luminosity. We find a decrease in density with redshift,
consistent with galaxy evolution for this uniform, flux-limited survey. These
results are consistent with expectations from the orientation-driven AGN
unification model, at least for the high radio luminosity regimes considered in

galaxies together, and provide an important reservoir of gas for galaxy growth
and accretion. Here we present very high resolution two-dimensional simulations
of the thermal and chemical evolution of such filaments, making use of a 32
species chemistry network that tracks the evolution of key molecules formed
from hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon. We study the evolution of filaments over a
wide range of parameters including the initial density, initial temperature,
strength of the dissociating UV background, and metallicity. In low-redshift,
$Z \approx 0.1 Z_\odot $ filaments, the evolution is determined completely by
the initial cooling time. If this is sufficiently short, the center of the
filament always collapses to form dense, cold core containing a substantial
fraction of molecules. In high-redshift, $Z=10^{-3} Z_\odot$ filaments, the
collapse proceeds much more slowly. This is due mostly to the lower initial
temperatures, which leads to a much more modest increase in density before the
atomic cooling limit is reached, making subsequent molecular cooling much less
efficient.
  Finally, we study how the gravitational potential from a nearby dwarf galaxy
affects the collapse of the filament and compare this to NGC 5253, a nearby
starbusting dwarf galaxy thought to be fueled by the accretion of filament gas.
In contrast to our fiducial case, a substantial density peak forms at the
center of the potential. This peak evolves faster than the rest of the filament
due to the increased rate at which chemical species form and cooling occur. We
find that we achieve similar accretion rates as NGC 5253 but our
two-dimensional simulations do not recover the formation of the giant molecular
clouds that are seen in radio observations.

$c=8k$ for integer $k$. While there is a single such state with $c=8$, there
are, naively, two such states with $c=16$, corresponding to the two distinct
even unimodular lattices in 16 dimensions. However, we show that these two
phases are the same in the bulk, which is a consequence of the uniqueness of
signature $(8k +n, n)$ even unimodular lattices. The bulk phases are stably
equivalent, in a sense that we make precise. However, there are two different
phases of the edge corresponding to these two lattices, thereby realizing a
novel form of the bulk-edge correspondence. Two distinct fully chiral edge
phases are associated with the same bulk phase, which is consistent with the
uniqueness of the bulk since the transition between them, which is generically
first-order, can occur purely at the edge. Our construction is closely related
to $T$-duality of toroidally compactified heterotic strings. We discuss
generalizations of these results.

solid-state implementations of quantum networks, quantum computers, and
ultra-low power opto-electronic devices. A key component for many of these

solid-state quantum bit (qubit) conditionally controls the state of a photonic

non-destructive quantum measurements, and strong photon-photon interactions.
Here we experimentally realize a quantum logic gate between an optical photon
and a solid-state qubit. The qubit is composed of a quantum dot (QD) strongly
coupled to a nano-cavity, which acts as a coherently controllable qubit system
that conditionally flips the polarization of a photon on picosecond timescales,
implementing a controlled-NOT (cNOT) gate. Our results represent an important

attempt to communicate over wide potential spectrum without causing significant
interference to the Primary Users (PUs). A spectrum sensing algorithm is a
critical component of any sensing strategy. Performance of conventional
spectrum detection methods is severely limited when the average SNR of the
fading channel between the PU transmitter and the SU sensor is low. Cooperative
sensing and advanced detection techniques only partially remedy this problem. A
key limitation of conventional approaches is that the sensing threshold is
determined from the miss detection rate averaged over the fading distribution.
In this paper, the threshold is adapted to the instantaneous PU-to-SU Channel
State Information (CSI) under the prescribed collision probability constraint,
and a novel sensing strategy design is proposed for overlay CR network where
the instantaneous false alarm probability is incorporated into the belief
update and the reward computation. It is demonstrated that the proposed sensing
approach improves SU confidence, randomizes sensing decisions, and
significantly improves SU network throughput while satisfying the collision
probability constraint to the PUs in the low average PU-to-SU SNR region.
Moreover, the proposed adaptive sensing strategy is robust to mismatched and
correlated fading CSI and improves significantly on conventional cooperative
sensing techniques. Finally, joint adaptation to PU channel gain and SU link
CSI is explored to further improve CR throughput and reduce SU collisions.

HST/STIS toward a bright background quasar. Metal absorption lines of Fe II, Mg
II, and Mg I in the halo of NGC 891 are clearly seen, and when combined with
recent deep H I observations, we are able to place constraints on the
metallicity of the halo gas for the first time. The H I line width defines the
line broadening, from which we model opacity effects in these metal lines,
assuming the absorbing gas is continuously distributed in the halo. The
gas-phase metallicities are [Fe/H] = -1.18 +/- 0.07 and [Mg/H] = -0.23
+0.36/-0.27 (statistical errors) and this difference is probably due to
differential depletion onto grains. When corrected for such depletion using
Galactic gas as a guide, both elements have approximately solar or even
supersolar abundances. This suggests that the gas is from the galaxy disk,
probably expelled into the halo by a galactic fountain, rather than from
accretion of intergalactic gas, which would have a low metallicity. The
abundances would be raised by significant amounts if the absorbing gas lies in
a few clouds with thermal widths smaller than the rotational velocity of the
halo. If this is the case, both the abundances and [Mg/Fe] would be supersolar.

masses between 0.6 and 0.8 Msun. Models with an initial metallicity of
Z_0=0.00017 and mass loss rates from 10e-15 Msun to 10e-12 Msun were
calculated. They were then compared to previous models with mass loss, as well
as to models with turbulent mixing. For models with an initial metallicity of
Fe/H=-2.31, mass loss rates of about 10e-12 Msun lead to surface abundance
profiles that are very similar to those obtained in models with turbulence.
Both models have about the same level of agreement with observations of
galactic-halo lithium abundances, as well as lithium and other elemental
abundances from metal poor globular clusters such as NGC 6397. In this cluster,
models with mass loss agree slightly better with subgiant observations of Li
abundance than those with turbulence. Lower red giant branch stars instead
favor the models with turbulence. Larger differences between models with mass
loss and those with turbulence appear in the interior concentrations of metals.
The relatively high mass loss rates required to reproduce plateau-like lithium
abundances appear unlikely when compared to the solar mass-loss rate. However
the presence of a chromosphere on these stars justifies further investigation
of the mass-loss rates.

RNAseq. While these studies are potentially extremely powerful, a
computationally intensive procedure--the de novo construction of a reference
transcriptome must be completed as a prerequisite to further analyses. The
accurate reference is critically important as all downstream steps, including
estimating transcript abundance are critically dependent on the construction of
an accurate reference. Though a substantial amount of research has been done on
assembly, only recently have the pre-assembly procedures been studied in
detail. Specifically, several stand-alone error correction modules have been
reported on, and while they have shown to be effective in reducing errors at
the level of sequencing reads, how error correction impacts assembly accuracy
is largely unknown. Here, we show via use of a simulated dataset, that applying
error correction to sequencing reads has significant positive effects on
assembly accuracy, by reducing assembly error by nearly 50%, and therefore
should be applied to all datasets.

is becoming increasingly severe, especially for global on-chip buses. To cope
with this problem, accurate delay models of coupled interconnects are needed.
In particular, delay models based on analytical approaches are desirable,
because they not only are largely transparent to technology, but also
explicitly establish the connections between delays of coupled interconnects
and transition patterns, thereby enabling crosstalk alleviating techniques such
as crosstalk avoidance codes (CACs). Unfortunately, existing analytical delay
models, such as the widely cited model in [1], have limited accuracy and do not
account for loading capacitance. In this paper, we propose analytical delay

catalogues where the transformation between the coordinate systems of the two
catalagoues is unknown and may include shearing. Finding a given object whether
a star or asterism from the first catalogue in the second is logarithmic in
time rather than polynomial, yielding a dramatic speed up relative to a naive
implementation. Both acceleration of the matching algorithm and the ability to
solve for arbitrary affine transformations not only will allow the registration
of stellar catalogues and images that are now impossible to use but also will
find applications in machine vision and other imaging applications.

denoising is proposed. The proposed algorithm also introduces a modification of
similarity measure for patch comparison. The standard Euclidean norm is
replaced by weighted Euclidean norm for patch based comparison. Assuming the
patch as an oriented surface, notion of normal vector patch is being associated
with each patch. The inner product of these normal vector patches is then used
in weighted Euclidean distance of photometric patches as the weight factor. The
algorithm involves two steps: The first step is multiscale implementation of an
accelerated non-local means filtering in the stationary wavelet domain to
obtain a refined version of the noisy patches for later comparison. This step
is inspired by a preselection phase of finding similar patches in various
non-local means approaches. The next step is to apply the modified non-local
means filtering to the noisy image using the reference patches obtained in the
first step. These refined patches contain less noise, and consequently the
computation of normal vectors and partial derivatives is more accurate.
Experimental results indicate equivalent or better performance of proposed
algorithm as compared to various state of the art algorithms.

(BQPs). Two classic relaxation methods are widely used for solving BQPs,
namely, spectral methods and semidefinite programming (SDP), each with their
own advantages and disadvantages. Spectral relaxation is simple and easy to
implement, but its bound is loose. Semidefinite relaxation has a tighter bound,
but its computational complexity is high for large scale problems. We present a
new SDP formulation for BQPs, with two desirable properties. First, it has a
similar relaxation bound to conventional SDP formulations. Second, compared
with conventional SDP methods, the new SDP formulation leads to a significantly
more efficient and scalable dual optimization approach, which has the same
degree of complexity as spectral methods. Extensive experiments on various
applications including clustering, image segmentation, co-segmentation and
registration demonstrate the usefulness of our SDP formulation for solving
large-scale BQPs.

We base our analysis on the Smith's equation which involves the Cram\'er-Rao
Bound (CRB). This equation provides the theoretical ARL which is independent of
a specific estimator. Our methodology is the following: first, we derive a
closed-form expression of the CRB for the considered problem. Using these
expressions, we can rewrite the Smith's equation as a 4-th order polynomial by
assuming a small separation of the sources. Finally, we derive in closed-form
the analytic ARL under or not the assumption of low noise variance. The
obtained expression is compact and can provide useful qualitative informations
on the behavior of the ARL.

BS's to the path-gain from the serving BS), which are two key ingredients of

reality. We observe, as commonly expected, that a strong variance of the
shadowing increases the mean path-loss with respect to the serving BS, which in
consequence, may compromise QoS. However, in some cases, an increase of the
variance of the shadowing can significantly reduce the mean interference factor
and, in consequence, improve some QoS metrics in interference limited systems,
provided the handover policy selects the BS with the smallest path loss as the
serving one. We exemplify this phenomenon, similar to stochastic resonance and
related to the ""single big jump principle"" of the heavy-tailed log-nornal
distribution, studying the blocking probability in regular, hexagonal networks
in a semi-analytic manner, using a spatial version of the Erlang's loss formula
combined with Kaufman-Roberts algorithm. More detailed probabilistic analysis
explains that increasing variance of the log-normal shadowing amplifies the
ratio between the strongest signal and all other signals thus reducing the
interference. The above observations might shed new light, in particular on the

Prandtl number, their modification of the collision term may have different
dynamic effect in the non-equilibrium transition flow regimes. With the
introduction of one free parameter, a generalized kinetic model with the
combination of the ES-model and S-model can be developed, and this new model
can get the correct Navier-Stokes equations in the continuum flow regime as
well, but with abundant dynamic effect through the adjustment of the new degree
of freedom. In order to validate the generalized model, a numerical method
based on the unified gas kinetic scheme (UGKS) has been developed for the new

parameter has been tested, where the ES-model and S-model become the limiting
cases. In transition flow regime, many physical problems, i.e., the shock
structure and micro-flows, have been studied using the generalized model. With
a careful choice of the free parameter, good results can be achieved for most
test cases. The overall conclusion is that the S-model predicts more accurate
numerical solutions in most tough test cases presented in this paper than the
ES-model, while ES-model performs better in the cases when the flow is mostly
driven by heat, such as a channel flow with large boundary temperature
variations at high Knudsen number. The numerical study demonstrates the
necessity of developing such a generalized model. With the inclusion of one

with both general-purpose CPUs, and ""accelerators"", often in the form of
graphical processing units (GPUs). StarPU is a C library to exploit such
platforms. It provides users with ways to define ""tasks"" to be executed on CPUs
or GPUs, along with the dependencies among them, and by automatically
scheduling them over all the available processing units. In doing so, it also
relieves programmers from the need to know the underlying architecture details:
it adapts to the available CPUs and GPUs, and automatically transfers data
between main memory and GPUs as needed. While StarPU's approach is successful
at addressing run-time scheduling issues, being a C library makes for a poor
and error-prone programming interface. This paper presents an effort started in
2011 to promote some of the concepts exported by the library as C language
constructs, by means of an extension of the GCC compiler suite. Our main
contribution is the design and implementation of language extensions that map
to StarPU's task programming paradigm. We argue that the proposed extensions
make it easier to get started with StarPU,eliminate errors that can occur when
using the C library, and help diagnose possible mistakes. We conclude on future
work.

show that the number of distinguishable countable models for a complete

Vaught's conjecture. The proof in the presence of equality is fairly easy,
though we need infinite conjunctions to implement it and somewhat heavy
theorems from descriptive set theory. However, the case without equality seems
to be much more difficult (because we cannot count without equality) and in
this case algebraic logic comes to our rescue via the representation theory of
locally finite quasi polyadic algebras. We show that the equivalence relation
induced by such (indistinguishable) models is a Borel subset of the product of
the Stone Polish space (consisting of ultarfilters corresponding to models)

dealing with crowded scenes where traditional tracking based approaches tend to

to foreground objects and effectively ignores irrelevant background dynamics.
Input frames are split into non-overlapping cells, followed by extracting
features based on motion, size and texture from each cell. Each feature type is
independently analysed for the presence of an anomaly. Unlike most methods, a
refined estimate of object motion is achieved by computing the optical flow of
only the foreground pixels. The motion and size features are modelled by an
approximated version of kernel density estimation, which is computationally
efficient even for large training datasets. Texture features are modelled by an
adaptively grown codebook, with the number of entries in the codebook selected
in an online fashion. Experiments on the recently published UCSD Anomaly
Detection dataset show that the proposed method obtains considerably better
results than three recent approaches: MPPCA, social force, and mixture of

faster than MDT, the next best performing method.

ULIRGs. As a class, the median values of the distributions are Av=5.3 mag and
Av=6.5 mag for the LIRG and ULIRG subsamples, respectively.
  We evaluated the effects of the galaxy distance in the measurements of the
extinction as a function of the linear scale (in kpc) of the spaxel (i.e. due
to the limited angular resolution of the observations). If the distribution of
the gas/dust and star-forming regions in local LIRGs (63 Mpc, 40 pc/spaxel on
average) is the same for galaxies at greater distances, the observed median Av
values based on emission line ratios would be a factor ~0.8 lower at the
average distance of our ULIRG sample (328 Mpc, 0.2 kpc/spaxel), and a factor
~0.67 for galaxies located at distances of more than 800 Mpc (0.4 kpc/spaxel).
This distance effect would have implications for deriving the intrinsic
extinction in high-z star-forming galaxies and for subsequent properties such
as star formation rate, star formation surface density, and KS- law, based on
H_alpha line fluxes. If local LIRGs are analogues of the main-sequence
star-forming galaxies at cosmological distances, the extinction values (Av)
derived from the observed emission lines in these high-z sources would need to
be increased by a factor 1.4 on average.

$T_{mn}={g_{mn}}+4u_mu_n+\sum_{N}T^{(N)}_{mn}$ where $u$ is the vector
excitation satisfying $u^2=-1$ and $N$ is the order of the gradient expansion
in the dissipative part of the tensor. We calculate the contributions up to
N=2. The higher spin excitations contribute to the $\beta$-function, ensuring
the overall Weyl covariance of the matter stress tensor. We conjecture that the
structure of gradient expansion in $d=4$ conformal hydrodynamics at higher
orders is controlled by the higher spin operator algebra in $AdS_5$.

particle-identification (PID) requirements (e.g. low momentum cut-off and low
material budget), the ALICE experiment provides significant information about
hadron production both in pp and Pb-Pb collisions. In particular, the $p_{\rm
T}$-differential and integrated production yields of identified particles play
a key role in the study of the collective and thermal properties of the matter
formed in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Furthermore, the production of
high-$p_{\rm T}$ particles provides insights into the property of the hot
medium created in such collisions and the in-medium energy-loss mechanisms.
Transverse momentum spectra of $\pi^{\pm}$, K$^{\pm}$, p and $\bar{\rm p}$ are
measured at mid-rapidity ($\left|y\right| <~0.5$) over a wide momentum range,
from $\sim$~100 MeV/$c$ up to $\sim$~20 GeV/$c$. The current results on
light-flavour charged-hadron production will be presented for pp collisions at
$\sqrt{s}$ = 0.9, 2.76 and 7 TeV and for Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm
NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV. Integrated production yields, transverse momentum spectra and
particle ratios in pp are discussed as a function of the collision energy and
compared to previous experiments and commonly-used Monte Carlo models. Pb-Pb
collisions at the LHC feature the highest radial flow ever observed and an
unexpectedly low p/$\pi$ production ratio. The results are presented as a
function of collision centrality and compared to RHIC data in Au-Au collisions
at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV and predictions from thermal and hydrodynamic
models. The nuclear modification factor ($R_{\rm AA}$) of identified hadrons
will also be discussed and compared to unidentified charged particles and
theoretical predictions. This is observed to be identical for all particle
species at high-$p_{\rm T}$.

clear evidence for strong maser amplication in all three sources, exhibiting
narrow (roughly 1 km/s FWHM) emission features that are coincident
(kinematically and/or spatially) with observed 22 GHz features. Moreover, in
the case of W49N - for which observations were available at three epochs
spanning a two year period - the spectra exhibited variability. The observed
621 GHz/22 GHz line ratios are consistent with a maser pumping model in which
the population inversions arise from the combined effects of collisional
excitation and spontaneous radiative decay, and the inferred physical
conditions can plausibly arise in gas heated by either dissociative or
non-dissociative shocks. The collisional excitation model also predicts that
the 22 GHz population inversion will be quenched at higher densities than that

observational fact that 22 GHz maser emission appears to be a necessary but
insufficient condition for 621 GHz maser emission.

limitations on the class of L-automatic structures for a fixed L of finite

CP is spontaneously broken at high energies, after breaking of flavor symmetry,
by a complex vacuum expectation value of $A_{4}$-triplet and gauge singlet
scalar field. We show that the spontaneously generated CP phase could become a
natural source of leptogenesis, %CP violation for neutrino oscillation and
leptogenesis, respectively. Then, and also investigate CP violation at low
energies in the lepton sector and show how the CP phases in PMNS could be
arisen through spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism.
  As a numerical study, interestingly, we show that the normal mass hierarchy
favors relatively large values of $\theta_{13}$, large deviations from
maximality of $\theta_{23}<\pi/4$ and Dirac-CP phase
$0^{\circ}\leq\delta_{CP}\leq50^{\circ}$ and
$300^{\circ}\leq\delta_{CP}\leq360^{\circ}$. For the inverted hierarchy case,
the experimentally measured values of $\theta_{13}$ favors $\theta_{23}>\pi/4$
and discrete values of $\delta_{CP}$ around
$100^{\circ},135^{\circ},255^{\circ}$ and $300^{\circ}$. Finally, with a
successful leptogenesis our numerical results give more predictive values on
the Dirac CP phase: for the normal mass hierarchy
$1^{\circ}\lesssim\delta_{CP}\lesssim10^{\circ}$ and for inverted one
$\delta_{CP}\sim100^{\circ},135^{\circ},300^{\circ}$.

protein, which is involved in both gene regulation and DNA compaction. H-NS can
bind to DNA in two different ways: in trans, by binding to two separate DNA
duplexes, or in cis, by binding to different sites on the same duplex. Based on
scanning force microscopy imaging and optical trap-driven unzipping assays, it
has recently been suggested that DNA compaction may result from the
antagonistic effects of H-NS binding to DNA in trans and cis configurations. In
order to get more insight into the compaction mechanism, we constructed a
coarse-grained model description of the compaction of bacterial DNA by H-NS.
These simulations highlight the fact that DNA compaction indeed results from
the subtle equilibrium between several competing factors, which include the
deformation dynamics of the plasmid and the several binding modes of protein
dimers to DNA, i.e. dangling configurations, cis- and trans-binding. In
particular, the degree of compaction is extremely sensitive to the difference
in binding energies of the cis and trans configurations. Our simulations also
point out that the conformations of the DNA-protein complexes are significantly
different in bulk and in planar conditions, suggesting that conformations
observed on mica surfaces may differ significantly from those that prevail in
living cells.

  Aim. Our aim is to open a new search space with first-generation systems such
as NACO at the Very Large Telescope, by providing ground-breaking inner working
angle (IWA) capabilities in the L' band. The L' band is a sweet spot for high
contrast coronagraphy since the planet-to-star brightness ratio is favorable,
while the Strehl ratio is naturally higher.
  Methods. An annular groove phase mask (AGPM) vector vortex coronagraph
optimized for the L' band, made from diamond subwavelength gratings was
manufactured and qualified in the lab. The AGPM enables high contrast imaging
at very small IWA, potentially being the key to unexplored discovery space.
  Results. Here we present the installation and successful on-sky tests of an
L'-band AGPM coronagraph on NACO. Using angular differential imaging, which is
well suited to the rotational symmetry of the AGPM, we demonstrated a \Delta L'

with that obtained from field measurements of the vertical variation of mean
wind speed (Powell et al., 2003), which showed a reduction of C_d with wind
speed rising to hurricane conditions. The present approach opens new
opportunities for modeling of drag coefficient in hurricane conditions by using
radiometric measurements instead of direct wind speed measurements.

performance of sparse signals, generalized OMP (gOMP) has recently been studied
in the literature. In this paper, we present a new analysis of the gOMP
algorithm using restricted isometry property (RIP). We show that if the
measurement matrix $\mathbf{\Phi} \in \mathcal{R}^{m \times n}$ satisfies the
RIP with $$\delta_{\max \left\{9, S + 1 \right\}K} \leq \frac{1}{8},$$ then
gOMP performs stable reconstruction of all $K$-sparse signals $\mathbf{x} \in
\mathcal{R}^n$ from the noisy measurements $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{\Phi x} +
\mathbf{v}$ within $\max \left\{K, \left\lfloor \frac{8K}{S} \right\rfloor
\right\}$ iterations where $\mathbf{v}$ is the noise vector and $S$ is the
number of indices chosen in each iteration of the gOMP algorithm. For Gaussian
random measurements, our results indicate that the number of required
measurements is essentially $m = \mathcal{O}(K \log \frac{n}{K})$, which is a
significant improvement over the existing result $m = \mathcal{O}(K^2 \log

interaction network in pairwise models with Ising variables. By using the
pseudolikelihood method (PLM) at high temperature, it is generally possible to
distinguish between zero and nonzero couplings because a clear gap separate the
two groups. However at lower temperatures the PLM is much less effective and
the result depends on subjective choices, such as the value of the $\ell_1$
regularizer and that of the threshold to separate nonzero couplings from null
ones. We introduce a decimation procedure based on the PLM that recursively
sets to zero the less significant couplings, until the variation of the
pseudolikelihood signals that relevant couplings are being removed. The new
method is fully automated and does not require any subjective choice by the
user. Numerical tests have been performed on a wide class of Ising models,
having different topologies (from random graphs to finite dimensional lattices)
and different couplings (both diluted ferromagnets in a field and spin
glasses). These numerical results show that the new algorithm performs better
than standard PLM

are fully assessed using \textit{ab initio} path-integral molecular dynamics
simulations. With the inclusion of NQEs, ionic diffusions are strongly enhanced
by the magnitude from 100% to 15% with increasing temperature, while electrical
conductivities are significantly suppressed. The analyses of ionic structures
and zero-point energy show also the importance of NQEs in these regime. The
significant quantum delocalization of ions introduces expressively different
scattering cross section between protons compared with classical particle
treatments, which can explain the large alterability of transport behaviors.
Furthermore, the energy, pressure, and isotope effects are also greatly
influenced by NQEs. The complex behaviors show that NQEs can not be neglected

Exploring a wide range of parameters we find, unexpectedly, that states with

centers of present-day galaxies, and their presence has been confirmed at z
$\geq$ 6. Their formation at such early epochs is still an enigma. Different
pathways have been suggested to assemble supermassive black holes in the first
billion years after the Big Bang. Direct collapse has emerged as a highly
plausible scenario to form black holes as it provides seed masses of $\rm
10^{5}-10^{6}~M_{\odot}$. Gravitational collapse in atomic cooling haloes with
virial temperatures T$_{vir} \geq 10^{4}$~K may lead to the formation of
massive seed black holes in the presence of an intense background UV flux.
Turbulence plays a central role in regulating accretion and transporting
angular momentum. We present here the highest resolution cosmological
large-eddy simulations to date which track the evolution of high-density
regions on scales of $0.25$~AU beyond the formation of the first peak, and
study the impact of subgrid-scale turbulence. The peak density reached in these
simulations is $\rm 1.2 \times 10^{-8}~g~cm^{-3}$. Our findings show that while
fragmentation occasionally occurs, it does not prevent the growth of a central
massive object resulting from turbulent accretion and occasional mergers. The
central object reaches $\rm \sim 1000~M_{\odot}$ within $4$ free-fall times,
and we expect further growth up to $\rm 10^{6}~M_{\odot}$ through accretion in
about 1 million years. The direct collapse model thus provides a viable pathway
of forming high-mass black holes at early cosmic times.

ingredient ineluctably present in most real applications: random-field-like
quenched disorder. In accord with simulations and previous findings,
coexistence between the two competing states/opinions turns out to be strongly
favored by disorder in the standard voter model; actually, a disorder-induced
phase transition is generated for any finite system size in the presence of an
arbitrary small spontaneous-inversion rate (preventing absorbing states from
being stable). For non-linear versions of the voter model a general theory (by
AlHammal et al.) explains that the spontaneous breaking of the up/down symmetry
and an absorbing state phase transition can occur either together or
separately, giving raise to two different scenarios. Here, we show that he
presence of quenched disorder in non-linear voter models does not allow the
separation of the up-down (Ising-like) symmetry breaking from the
active-to-absorbing phase transition in low-dimensional systems: both phenomena
can occur only simultaneously, as a consequence of the well-known Imry-Ma
argument generalized to these non-equilibrium problems. When the two phenomena
occur at unison, resulting into a genuinely non-equilibrium (""Generalized
Voter"") transition, the Imry-Ma argument is violated and the symmetry can be
spontaneously broken even in low dimensions.

using evolution strategies (ES). Automatic music transcription is a complex
process that still remains an open challenge. Using an audio signal to be
transcribed as target for our ES, information needed to generate a MIDI file
can be extracted from this latter one. Many techniques presented in the
literature at present exist and a few of them have applied evolutionary
algorithms to address this problem in the context of considering it as a search
space problem. However, ES have never been applied until now. The experiments
showed that by using these machines learning tools, some shortcomings presented
by other evolutionary algorithms based approaches for transcription can be
solved. They include the computation cost and the time for convergence. As
evolution strategies use self-adapting parameters, we show in this paper that
by correctly tuning the value of its strategy parameter that controls the
standard deviation, a fast convergence can be triggered toward the optima,
which from the results performs the transcription of the music with good
accuracy and in a short time. In the same context, the computation task is
tackled using parallelization techniques thus reducing the computation time and
the transcription time in the overall.

such a technique that allocates secure keys only for short distances. While not
completely secure, it offers huge advantages over traditional methods by the
use of entanglement swapping and quantum teleportation. Reversible logic gates
like CNOT, Toffoli, Fredkin etc. are of basic importance in Quantum Computing.
In our research, we adopted a EPR-pair allocation scheme in terms of these
quantum gates to overcome the susceptibility caused by malicious nodes. As the

catalogue. The average BAL properties are evaluated by taking the ratios of
average BALQ spectra to the average spectra of matched samples of non-BALQs,
where the matching is based on various emission properties. We find the
following properties. (i) There is no detectable Lyman edge associated with the
BAL absorbing gas (tau<0.1). (ii) The known increase of average absorption
depth with the ionization potential extends to the higher ionization N V and O
VI BALs. We also find that the C IV BAL profile is controlled by two
parameters. (i) The He II emission EW, which controls the typical velocity of
the C IV BAL, but does not affect the absorption depth. (ii) The spectral slope
in the 1700-3000 {\AA} range (alpha_UVl), which controls the C IV peak
absorption depth, but does not affect the typical velocity. The He II EW and
alpha_UVl also control the observed fraction of quasars that are BALQs. We
suggest that a lower He II EW may indicate a weaker ionizing continuum, which
allows the outflow to reach higher velocities before being overionized,
possibly without a need to invoke a shielding gas. A redder continuum may
indicate a more inclined system, and a larger covering factor and larger column
of the outflow along the line of sight.

runtime library by a new dual-pivot Quicksort variant due to Vladimir
Yaroslavskiy. The decision was based on the strikingly good performance of
Yaroslavskiy's implementation in running time experiments. At that time, no
precise investigations of the algorithm were available to explain its superior
performance - on the contrary: Previous theoretical studies of other dual-pivot
Quicksort variants even discouraged the use of two pivots. Only in 2012, two of
the authors gave an average case analysis of a simplified version of
Yaroslavskiy's algorithm, proving that savings in the number of comparisons are
possible. However, Yaroslavskiy's algorithm needs more swaps, which renders the
analysis inconclusive.
  To force the issue, we herein extend our analysis to the fully detailed style
of Knuth: We determine the exact number of executed Java Bytecode instructions.
Surprisingly, Yaroslavskiy's algorithm needs sightly more Bytecode instructions
than a simple implementation of classic Quicksort - contradicting observed
running times. Like in Oracle's library implementation we incorporate the use
of Insertionsort on small subproblems and show that it indeed speeds up
Yaroslavskiy's Quicksort in terms of Bytecodes; but even with optimal
Insertionsort thresholds the new Quicksort variant needs slightly more Bytecode
instructions on average.
  Finally, we show that the (suitably normalized) costs of Yaroslavskiy's
algorithm converge to a random variable whose distribution is characterized by
a fixed-point equation. From that, we compute variances of costs and show that
for large n, costs are concentrated around their mean.

two different dynamo source region geometries are obtainable. Specifically, we
find that smaller planets and planets with thicker H/He envelopes are likely to
be in the regime of a thick-shelled dynamo. Massive planets and planets with
thin H/He envelopes are likely to be in the regime of a thin-shelled dynamo.

limit where two back hole and their cosmological horizons coincide. By a
carefully analysis of the horizon perturbation equation, we show that
(anti)evaporation can not happen if we use a diagonal tetrad basis. This result
implies that a typical black hole in any generic form of generalized
teleparallel gravity is frozen in its initial state if we use the diagonal
tetrads. But in the case of non-diagonal tetrads the analysis is completely
different. By a suitable non trivial non-diagonal tetrad basis we investigate
the linear stability of the model under perturbations of the metric and torsion
simultaneously. We observe that in spite of the diagonal case, both evaporation
and anti evaporation can happen. The phenomena depend on the initial phase of
the horizon perturbation. In the first mode when we restrict ourselves to the
first lower modes the (anti)evaporation happens. So, in non-diagonal case the
physical phenomena is reasonable. This is an important advantage of using

the modified method of simplest equation to obtain exact traveling-wave
solutions connected to migration of population members. Such solutions are
obtained for systems consisting of 1 or 3 populations respectively. For the
case (II.) we discuss model equations of the Fokker-Planck kind for the
evolution of the statistical distributions of population densities. We derive
several stationary distributions for the population density and calculate the
expected exit time connected to the extinction of the studied population.

single photons"" in a two-slit interference experiment [Science 332, 1170
(2011)]. This was possible by using the quantum weak-measurements method, which
implies averaging over many events, i.e., in fact, a multi-photon limit of
classical linear optics. We give a classical-optics interpretation to this
experiment and other related problems. It appears that weak measurements of the
local momentum of photons made by Kocsis et al. represent measurements of the
Poynting vector in an optical field. We consider both the real and imaginary
parts of the local momentum, and show that their measurements have been
realized in classical optics using small probe particles. We also examine the
appearance of ""anomalous"" values of the local momentum: either negative
(backflow) or exceeding the wavenumber (superluminal propagation). These
features appear to be closely related to vortices and evanescent waves.
Finally, we revisit a number of older works and find examples of
photon-trajectories and anomalous-momentum measurements in various optical
experiments.

center vortices in SU (2) lattice gauge theory as examples of the phenomena
which may arise in a vortex vacuum. In particular we analyze the creation of
near-zero modes from would-be zero modes of various topological charge
contributions from center vortices. We show that classical colorful spherical
vortex and instanton ensembles have almost identical Dirac spectra and the
low-lying eigenmodes from spherical vortices show all characteristic properties
for chiral symmetry breaking. We further show that also vortex intersections
are able to give rise to a finite density of near-zero modes, leading to chiral
symmetry breaking via the Banks-Casher formula. We discuss the mechanism by
which center vortex fluxes contribute to chiral symmetry breaking.

particular solution of the point transformed equation
$d^{2}X/dT^{2}+X^{n}\left(T\right) =0$, $n\notin \left\{-3,-1,0,1\right\} $,
which is equivalent to the anharmonic oscillator equation if the coefficients
$f_{i}(t)$, $i=1,2,3$ satisfy an integrability condition. The integrability
condition can be formulated as a Riccati equation for $f_{1}(t)$ and
$\frac{1}{f_{3}(t)}\frac{df_{3}}{dt}$ respectively. By reducing the
integrability condition to a Bernoulli type equation, two exact classes of
solutions of the anharmonic oscillator equation are obtained.

the status of world-wide society, based on three pillars: social sensing,
social mining, and the idea of trust networks and privacy-aware social mining.
We discuss the ingredients of a science and a technology necessary to build the
PNS upon the three mentioned pillars, beyond the limitations of their
respective state-of-art. Social sensing is aimed at developing better methods
for harvesting the big data from the techno-social ecosystem and make them
available for mining, learning and analysis at a properly high abstraction
level.Social mining is the problem of discovering patterns and models of human
behaviour from the sensed data across the various social dimensions by data
mining, machine learning and social network analysis. Trusted networks and
privacy-aware social mining is aimed at creating a new deal around the
questions of privacy and data ownership empowering individual persons with full
awareness and control on own personal data, so that users may allow access and
use of their data for their own good and the common good. The PNS will provide
a goal-oriented knowledge discovery framework, made of technology and people,
able to configure itself to the aim of answering questions about the pulse of
global society. Given an analytical request, the PNS activates a process
composed by a variety of interconnected tasks exploiting the social sensing and
mining methods within the transparent ecosystem provided by the trusted
network.

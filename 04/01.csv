solving a problem and/or explaining a concept. Grading these items is fairly
time consuming, and in large courses time constraints prohibit providing
significant individualized feedback on students' exams. Instructors typically
cross out areas of the response that are incorrect and write the total points
awarded or subtracted. Sometimes, instructors will also write a word or two to

individualized feedback, clearly communicates to students expected performance

the ARIES plans to establish a 3.6m new technology optical telescope at a new
site called Devasthal. This telescope will have instruments providing high

are also being established. A 1.3m aperture optical telescope to monitor
optically variable sources was installed at Devasthal in the year 2010 and a
0.5-m wide field (25 square degrees) Baker-Nunn Schmidt telescope to produce a
digital map of the Northern sky at optical bands was installed at Manora Peak
in 2011. A 4-m liquid mirror telescope for deep sky survey of transient sources
is planned at Devasthal. These optical facilities with specialized back-end

positive, negative or zero. Secondly, for spherically symmetric systems, there
are solutions with non-bidiagonal metrics. The g-metric fulfills Einstein
equations with a positive cosmological term and a matter source, while the
f-metric is anti-de Sitter. The third class contains solutions with bidiagonal
metrics, and these can be quite complex. The time-dependent solutions describe
homogeneous (isotropic or anisotropic) cosmologies which show a late-time
self-acceleration or other types of behavior. The static solutions describe
black holes with a massive graviton hair, and also globally regular lumps of
energy. None of these are asymptotically flat. Including a matter source gives
rise to asymptotically flat solutions which exhibit the Vainshtein mechanism of
recovery of General Relativity in a finite region.

unreported late-time infrared emission, in some cases more than 5 years
post-discovery. For this single epoch of data, the warm-dust parameters suggest
the presence of a radiative heating source consisting of optical/X-ray emission
continuously generated by ongoing CSM interaction. Here we present
multi-wavelength follow-up observations of this sample of 10 SNe IIn and the
well-studied Type IIn SN 2010jl. A recent epoch of Spitzer observations reveals
ongoing mid-infrared emission from nine of the SNe in this sample. We also
detect three of the SNe in archival WISE data, in addition to SNe 1987A,
2004dj, and 2008iy. For at least five of the SNe in the sample, optical and/or
X-ray emission confirms the presence of radiative emission from ongoing CSM
interaction. The two Spitzer nondetections are consistent with the forward
shock overrunning and destroying the dust shell, a result that places upper
limits on the dust-shell size. The optical and infrared observations confirm
the radiative heating model and constrain a number of model parameters,
including progenitor mass-loss characteristics. All of the SNe in this sample
experienced an outburst on the order of tens to hundreds of years prior to the
SN explosion followed by periods of less intense mass loss. Although all
evidence points to massive progenitors, the variation in the data highlights
the diversity in SN IIn progenitor evolution. While these observations do not
identify a particular progenitor system, they demonstrate that future,
coordinated, multi-wavelength campaigns can constrain theoretical mass-loss
models.

decomposed into three terms: an amplitude term, a phase term, and a cross term,
whereby the cross term is negligible at high signal-to-noise ratio. Theoretical
bounds of the amplitude and phase terms are derived for additive white Gaussian
noise channels with Gaussian inputs. This decomposition is then applied to the
recently proposed amplitude phase shift keying with product constellation

aspect is shown to relate to the theory of computational complexity. A physical
manifestation of the same effect is the Levinthal's paradox in the protein
folding problem. The resolution of this paradox for realistic proteins allows
to construct engines that can extract at a finite power 40% of the maximally

that these relaxations combined with branch-and-bound algorithms belong to the

using this relaxation is prohibitive in conventional machines for instances
with more than 22 locations due to memory limitations. This paper presents a
distributed version of a dual ascent algorithm for the RLT3 QAP relaxation that
approximately solves it for instances with up to 30 locations for the first
time. Although, basically, the distributed algorithm has been implemented on
top of its sequential conterpart, some changes, which improved not only the
parallel performance but also the quality of solutions, were proposed here.
When compared to other lower bounding methods found in the literature, our

z=0.058 and span a wide range in radio luminosity, allowing us to make the
first measurement of the local radio luminosity function at 20 GHz.
  Our sample includes some classical FR-1 and FR-2 radio galaxies, but most of
the AT20G-6dFGS galaxies host compact (FR-0) radio AGN which appear lack
extended radio emission even at lower frequencies. Most of these FR-0 sources
show no evidence for relativistic beaming, and the FR-0 class appears to be a
mixed population which includes young Compact Steep-Spectrum (CSS) and
Gigahertz-Peaked Spectrum (GPS) radio galaxies.
  We see a strong dichotomy in the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)
mid-infrared colours of the host galaxies of FR-1 and FR-2 radio sources, with
the FR-1 systems found almost exclusively in WISE `early-type' galaxies and the
FR-2 radio sources in WISE `late-type' galaxies.
  The host galaxies of the flat- and steep-spectrum radio sources have a
similar distribution in both K--band luminosity and WISE colours, though
galaxies with flat-spectrum sources are more likely to show weak emission lines
in their optical spectra. We conclude that these flat-spectrum and
steep-spectrum radio sources mainly represent different stages in radio-galaxy
evolution, rather than beamed and unbeamed radio-source populations.

nonlinearities, the computational complexity still depends on the dimension of
the original dynamical system. As a result, the reduced-order model loses its
computational efficiency, which, however, is its the most significant
advantage. Nonlinear dimensional reduction methods, such as the discrete
empirical interpolation method, have been widely used to evaluate the nonlinear
terms at a low cost. But when the finite element method is utilized for the
spatial discretization, nonlinear snapshot generation requires inner products
to be fulfilled, which costs lots of off-line time. Numerical integrations are
also needed over elements sharing the selected interpolation points during the
simulation, which keeps on-line time high. In this paper, we extend the finite
element method with interpolated coefficients to nonlinear reduced-order
models. It approximates the nonlinear function in the reduced-order model by
its finite element interpolation, which makes coefficient matrices of the
nonlinear terms pre-computable and, thus, leads to great savings in the
computational efforts. Due to the separation of spatial and temporal variables
in the finite element interpolation, the discrete empirical interpolation
method can be directly applied on the nonlinear functions. Therefore, the main
computational hurdles when applying the discrete empirical interpolation method
in the finite element context are conquered. We also establish a rigorous
asymptotic error estimation, which shows that the proposed approach achieves
the same accuracy as that of the standard finite element method under certain
smoothness assumptions of the nonlinear functions. Several numerical tests are
presented to validate the proposed method and verify the theoretical results.

thin elastic films on thick, compliant substrates. These patterns are often
induced by an elastic misfit which compresses the film. Blistering permits the
film to expand locally, reducing the elastic energy of the system. It is
natural to ask: what is the minimum elastic energy achievable by blistering on
a fixed area fraction of the substrate? This is a variational problem involving
both the {\it elastic deformation} of the film and substrate and the {\it
geometry} of the blistered region. It involves three small parameters: the {\it
nondimensionalized thickness} of the film, the {\it compliance ratio} of the
film/substrate pair and the {\it mismatch strain}. In formulating the problem,
we use a small-slope (F\""oppl-von K\'arm\'an) approximation for the elastic
energy of the film, and a local approximation for the elastic energy of the
substrate.
  For a 1D version of the problem, we obtain ""matching"" upper and lower bounds
on the minimum energy, in the sense that both bounds have the same scaling
behavior with respect to the small parameters. For a 2D version of the problem,
our results are less complete. Our upper and lower bounds only ""match"" in their
scaling with respect to the nondimensionalized thickness, not in the dependence
on the compliance ratio and the mismatch strain. The upper bound considers a 2D
lattice of blisters, and uses ideas from the literature on the folding or
""crumpling"" of a confined elastic sheet. Our main 2D result is that in a
certain parameter regime, the elastic energy of this lattice is significantly
lower than that of a few large blisters.

reduces the shear viscosity in terms of the magnetic catalysis, its effects are
almost negligible in the chiral-restored phase even for very strong magnetic

decreases and crosses zero somewhere in the very high energy scale. It is
usually considered as a signal of the instability of the standard model (SM)
vacuum, but it can also indicate a link between the physics in the electroweak
scale and the Planck scale. Furthermore, the LHC experiments as well as the
flavor physics experiments give strong constraints on the physics beyond the
SM. It urges us to reconsider the widely taken approach to the physics beyond
the SM (BSM), namely the approach based on the gauge unification below the
Planck scale and the resulting hierarchy problem. Motivated by the recent
experiments, we first revisit the hierarchy problem and consider an alternative
appoach based on a classical conformality of the SM without the Higgs mass
term.
  In this talk, I review our recent proposal of a B-L extension of the SM with
a flat Higgs potential at the Planck scale. This model can be an alternative
solution to the hierarchy problem as well as being phenomenologically viable to
explain the neutrino oscillations and the baryon asymmetry of the universe.
With an assumption that the Higgs has a flat potential at the Planck scale, we
show that the B-L symmetry is radiatively broken at the TeV scale via the
Coleman-Weinberg mechanism, and it triggers the electroweak symmetry breaking
through a radiatively generated scalar mixing. The ratio of these two breaking
scales is dynamically determined by the B-L gauge coupling.

developed by using a symbolic device known in the literature as the classical
umbral calculus. The advantage of this symbolic tool is twofold. First a moment
representation is allowed for a wide class of polynomial stochastic involving
the L\'evy processes in respect to which they are martingales. This
representation includes some well-known examples such as Hermite polynomials in
connection with Brownian motion. As a consequence, characterizations of many
other families of polynomials having the time space-harmonic property can be
recovered via the symbolic moment representation. New relations with
Kailath-Segall polynomials are stated. Secondly the generalization to the
multivariable framework is straightforward. Connections with cumulants and Bell
polynomials are highlighted both in the univariate case and in the multivariate
one. Open problems are addressed at the end of the paper.

such that a given variable only depends conditionally on its immediate
predecessor. For such sets, we show that the full joint probability
distribution may be expressed exclusively in terms of uni- and bivariate
marginals. Under the assumption that the CMB power spectrum likelihood only
exhibits correlations within a banded multipole range, \Delta l, we apply this
expression to two outstanding problems in CMB likelihood analysis. First, we
derive a statistically well-defined hybrid likelihood estimator, merging two
independent (e.g., low- and high-l) likelihoods into a single expression that
properly accounts for correlations between the two. Applying this expression to
the WMAP likelihood, we verify that the effect of correlations on cosmological
parameters in the transition region is negligible in terms of cosmological
parameters for WMAP; the largest relative shift seen for any parameter is
0.06\sigma. However, because this may not hold for other experimental setups
(e.g., for different instrumental noise properties or analysis masks), but must
rather be verified on a case-by-case basis, we recommend our new hybridization
scheme for future experiments for statistical self-consistency reasons. Second,
we use the same expression to improve the convergence rate of the Blackwell-Rao
likelihood estimator, reducing the required number of Monte Carlo samples by
several orders of magnitude, and thereby extend it to high-l applications.

by the INTEGRAL/SPI experiment, is highly concentrated towards the Galactic
centre. Its origin remains unknown despite decades of scrutiny. We propose a
novel scenario in which known extragalactic positron sources such as radio jets
of active galactic nuclei (AGN) fill the intergalactic medium with MeV e+e-
pairs, which are then accreted into the Milky Way. We show that interpreting
the diffuse cosmic radio background (CRB) as arising from radio sources with
characteristics similar to the observed cores and radio lobes in powerful AGN
jets suggests that the intergalactic positron-to-electron ratio could be as
high as 10^{-5}, although this can be decreased if the CRB is not all produced
by pairs and if not all positrons escape to the intergalactic medium. Assuming
an accretion rate of one solar mass per year of matter into the Milky Way, a
positron-to-electron ratio of only 10^{-7} is already enough to account for
much of the 511 keV emission of the Galaxy. A simple spherical accretion model
predicts an emission profile highly peaked in the central bulge, consistent
with INTEGRAL observations. However, a realistic model of accretion with
angular momentum would likely imply a more extended emission over the disk,
with uncertainties depending on the magnetic field structure and turbulence in
the galactic halo.

aim to understand which physical processes influence the PDF shape, and with
which signatures. The PDFs of Orion B (Aquila) show a lognormal distribution
for low column densities until Av 3 (6), and a power-law tail for high column
densities, consistent with a rho r^-2 profile for the equivalent spherical
density distribution. The PDF of Orion B is broadened by external compression
due to the nearby OB stellar aggregates. The PDF of a quiescent subregion of
the non-star-forming Polaris cloud is nearly lognormal, indicating that
supersonic turbulence governs the density distribution. But we also observe a
deviation from the lognormal shape at Av>1 for a subregion in Polaris that
includes a prominent filament. We conclude that (i) the point where the PDF
deviates from the lognormal form does not trace a universal Av-threshold for
star formation, (ii) statistical density fluctuations, intermittency and
magnetic fields can cause excess from the lognormal PDF at an early cloud
formation stage, (iii) core formation and/or global collapse of filaments and a
non-isothermal gas distribution lead to a power-law tail, and (iv) external
compression broadens the column density PDF, consistent with numerical
simulations.

partial differential equations in three complex variables whose coefficients
are singular along an analytic variety $\Theta$ in $\mathbb{C}^{2}$. The
coefficients are written as linear combinations of powers of a solution $X$ of
some first order nonlinear partial differential equation following an idea we
have initiated in a previous work \cite{mast}. The solutions $Y$ are shown to
develop singularities along $\Theta$ with estimates of exponential type
depending on the growth's rate of $X$ near the singular variety. We construct
these solutions with the help of series of functions with infinitely many
variables which involve derivatives of all orders of $X$ in one variable.
Convergence and bounds estimates of these series are studied using a majorant
series method which leads to an auxiliary functional equation that contains
differential operators in infinitely many variables. Using a fixed point
argument, we show that these functional equations actually have solutions in
some Banach spaces of formal power series.

potential) state. Recent observations, by comparison, reveal that many
solar-type stars show large-scale surface magnetic fields that are highly
non-potential - that is, they have been stressed above their lowest-energy
state. This non-potential component of the surface field is neglected by
current stellar wind models. The aim of this paper is to determine its effect
on the coronal structure and wind. We use Zeeman-Doppler surface magnetograms
of two stars - one with an almost potential, one with a non-potential surface
field - to extrapolate a static model of the coronal structure for each star.
We find that the stresses are carried almost exclusively in a band of
uni-directional azimuthal field that is confined to mid-latitudes. Using this
static solution as an initial state for an MHD wind model, we then find that
the final state is determined primarily by the potential component of the
surface magnetic field. The band of azimuthal field must be confined close to
the stellar surface as it is not compatible with a steady-state wind. By
artificially increasing the stellar rotation rate we demonstrate that the
observed azimuthal fields can not be produced by the action of the wind but
must be due to processes at or below the stellar surface. We conclude that the
background winds of solar-like stars are largely unaffected by these
highly-stressed surface fields. Nonetheless, the increased flare activity and
associated coronal mass ejections that may be expected to accompany such
highly-stressed fields may have a significant impact on any surrounding
planets.

Ryabko and Astola (2005, 2006b,a), but differs from these in that we add extra
randomness to the original stochatic process. It uses data compression to
estimate the entropy rate of a stochastic process, which allows it to measure
dependence among sets of random variables, as opposed to the existing
econometric literature that uses entropy and finds itself restricted to
pairwise tests of dependence. We show how serial dependence may be detected in
S&P500 and PSI20 stock returns over different sample periods and frequencies.

linear network coding solution over $\mathbb{F}_q$ in which the message
dimensions need not necessarily be the same and need not be the same as the
edge vector dimension. Scalar linear network coding, vector linear network
coding are special cases of linear FNC. In this paper, we establish the
connection between the existence of a linear FNC solution for a network over
$\mathbb{F}_q$ and the representability over $\mathbb{F}_q$ of discrete
polymatroids, which are the multi-set analogue of matroids. All previously
known results on the connection between the scalar and vector linear
solvability of networks and representations of matroids and discrete
polymatroids follow as special cases. An algorithm is provided to construct
networks which admit FNC solution over $\mathbb{F}_q,$ from discrete
polymatroids representable over $\mathbb{F}_q.$ Example networks constructed
from discrete polymatroids using the algorithm are provided, which do not admit
any scalar and vector solution, and for which FNC solutions with the message
dimensions being different provide a larger throughput than FNC solutions with
the message dimensions being equal.

the state of one network depends on the state of the other network and vice
versa. In particular, we focus on the interdependency between the power grid
and communication networks, where the grid depends on communications for its
control, and the communication network depends on the grid for power. A
real-world example is the Italian blackout of 2003, when a small failure in the
power grid cascaded between the two networks and led to a massive blackout. In
this paper, we study the minimum number of node failures needed to cause total
blackout (i.e., all nodes in both networks to fail). In the case of
unidirectional interdependency between the networks we show that the problem is
NP-hard, and develop heuristics to find a near-optimal solution. On the other
hand, we show that in the case of bidirectional interdependency this problem
can be solved in polynomial time. We believe that this new interdependency
model gives rise to important, yet unexplored, robust network design problems
for interdependent networked infrastructures.

much larger than the spin-induced contribution \hbar \omega/E_e, and it can be
observed experimentally. As a particular example, we consider transition
radiation from vortex electrons obliquely incident on an interface between a
vacuum and a dispersive medium, in which the magnetic moment contribution
manifests itself via a left-right angular asymmetry. For electrons with E_e =

takes light to cross Earth's orbital diameter. Given a stable celestial clock
that can be observed in gravitational waves the same principle can be used to
measure the propagation speed $\cgw$ of gravitational radiation. Space-based

space-based, LISA-like detectors, periodic sources are plentiful: by the end of

requires sub-microarcsec accuracy, which is theoretically possible with an
imaging space telescope using field stars as an astrometric reference. The
measurement must however overcome astrometric distortions which are much larger
than the photon noise limit. To address this issue, we propose to generate
faint stellar diffraction spikes using a two-dimensional grid of regularly
spaced small dark spots added to the surface of the primary mirror (PM).
Accurate astrometric motion of the host star is obtained by comparing the
position of the spikes to the background field stars. The spikes do not
contribute to scattered light in the central part of the field and therefore
allow unperturbed coronagraphic observation of the star's immediate
surrounding. Because the diffraction spikes are created on the PM and imaged on
the same focal plane detector as the background stars, astrometric distortions
affect equally the diffraction spikes and the background stars, and are
therefore calibrated. We describe the technique, detail how the data collected
by the wide-field camera are used to derive astrometric motion, and identify
the main sources of astrometric error using numerical simulations and
analytical derivations. We find that the 1.4 m diameter telescope, 0.3 sq.deg
field we adopt as a baseline design achieves 0.2 microarcsec single measurement
astrometric accuracy. The diffractive pupil concept thus enables
sub-microarcsec astrometry without relying on the accurate pointing, external
metrology or high stability hardware required with previously proposed high
precision astrometry concepts.

and masses, while coronagraphic imaging enables detailed characterization of
their physical properties and atmospheric compositions through spectroscopy. In
a previous paper, we showed that a diffractive pupil telescope (DPT) in space
can enable sub-microarcsecond accuracy astrometric measurements from wide-field
images by creating faint but sharp diffraction spikes around the bright target
star. The DPT allows simultaneous astrometric measurement and coronagraphic
imaging, and we discuss and quantify in this paper the scientific benefits of
this combination for exoplanet science investigations: identification of
exoplanets with increased sensitivity and robustness, and ability to measure
planetary masses to high accuracy. We show how using both measurements to
identify planets and measure their masses offers greater sensitivity and
provides more reliable measurements than possible with separate missions, and
therefore results in a large gain in mission efficiency. The combined
measurements reliably identify potentially habitable planets in multiple
systems with a few observations, while astrometry or imaging alone would
require many measurements over a long time baseline. In addition, the combined
measurement allows direct determination of stellar masses to percent-level
accuracy, using planets as test particles. We also show that the DPT maintains
the full sensitivity of the telescope for deep wide-field imaging, and is
therefore compatible with simultaneous scientific observations unrelated to
exoplanets. We conclude that astrometry, coronagraphy, and deep wide-field
imaging can be performed simultaneously on a single telescope without
significant negative impact on the performance of any of the three techniques.

instrumental in future spintronics applications. These magnetic properties are
known to depend crucially on the presence of defects. Here we review our recent
theoretical studies using density functional calculations on two types of
defects in carbon nanostructures: Substitutional doping with transition metals,
and sp$^3$-type defects created by covalent functionalization with organic and
inorganic molecules. We focus on such defects because they can be used to
create and control magnetism in graphene-based materials. Our main results are
summarized as follows: i)Substitutional metal impurities are fully understood
using a model based on the hybridization between the $d$ states of the metal
atom and the defect levels associated with an unreconstructed D$_{3h}$ carbon
vacancy. We identify three different regimes, associated with the occupation of
distinct hybridization levels, which determine the magnetic properties obtained
with this type of doping; ii) A spin moment of 1.0 $\mu_B$ is always induced by
chemical functionalization when a molecule chemisorbs on a graphene layer via a
single C-C (or other weakly polar) covalent bond. The magnetic coupling between
adsorbates shows a key dependence on the sublattice adsorption site. This
effect is similar to that of H adsorption, however, with universal character;
iii) The spin moment of substitutional metal impurities can be controlled using
strain. In particular, we show that although Ni substitutionals are
non-magnetic in flat and unstrained graphene, the magnetism of these defects
can be activated by applying either uniaxial strain or curvature to the
graphene layer. All these results provide key information about formation and
control of defect-induced magnetism in graphene and related materials.

constraints, including also the recent Higgs boson measurements for the mass

can satisfy in part of its parameter space the dark matter requirement but is
only marginally consistent with the current Higgs boson mass value. The
HyperCharge-AMSB and Mixed Moduli-AMSB scenarios can better describe present

measured mass of the Higgs boson. The inclusion of the preferred signal
strengths for the Higgs boson decay channels shows that for tan(beta) > 5 the

In contrast the minimal AMSB has a narrower allowed range in tan(beta). These

from both an active galactic nucleus (AGN) and supernovae on the galaxy's

in conjunction with supernova feedback to isolate the most important factors of
these feedback processes. We find that in isolated galaxies, supernovae
dominate the suppression of star formation but the star formation rate is
unaffected by the presence of an AGN. In mergers the converse is true when
models with strong AGN feedback are considered, shutting off star formation
before a starburst can occur. AGN and supernovae simulated together suppress
star formation only slightly more than if they acted independently. This
low-level interaction between the feedback processes is due to AGN feedback
maintaining the temperature of a hot halo of gas formed by supernovae. For each
of the feedback processes the heating temperature is the dominant parameter
rather than the overall energy budget or timing of heating events. Finally, we
find that the black hole mass is highly resolution dependent, with more massive
black holes found in lower resolution simulations.

mildly favor the equation of state of dark energy $\omega^{de}$ crossing -1 at
68% confidence level. However, phantom fields are generally ruled out by
ultraviolet quantum instabilities. To overcome this discrepancy, in this paper
we propose a mechanism to show that how the presence of bulk viscosity in the
cosmic fluid can temporarily drive the fluid into the phantom region
($\omega<-1$). As time is going on, phantom decays and ultimately $\omega^{de}$
approaches to -1. Then we show these quintessence and phantom descriptions of
non-viscous and viscous dark energy and reconstruct the potential of these two
scalar fields. Also a diagnostic for these models are performed by using the
statefinder pairs $\{s,r\}$. All results are obtained in an anisotropic
space-time which is a generalization of FLRW universe.

characteristics of different type of attacks by analyzing packets that sent or
received in network. These packets have a lot of features. But not all of them
is required to be analyzed to detect that specific type of attack. Detection
speed and computational cost is another vital matter here, because in these
types of problems, datasets are very huge regularly. In this paper we tried to
propose a very simple and fast feature selection method to eliminate features
with no helpful information on them. Result faster learning in process of
redundant feature omission. We compared our proposed method with three most
successful similarity based feature selection algorithm including Correlation
Coefficient, Least Square Regression Error and Maximal Information Compression
Index. After that we used recommended features by each of these algorithms in
two popular classifiers including: Bayes and KNN classifier to measure the
quality of the recommendations. Experimental result shows that although the
proposed method can't outperform evaluated algorithms with high differences in
accuracy, but in computational cost it has huge superiority over them.

monitored, using the Chandra HRC-I detector (about 0.1-10 keV energy range)
from 2006 to 2012 with the main aim to detect X-rays from optical novae. We
present a systematic analysis of all X-ray sources found in the 41 nova
monitoring observations, along with 23 M 31 central field HRC-I observations
available from the Chandra data archive starting in December 1999. Based on
these observations, we studied the X-ray long-term variability of the source
population and especially of X-ray binaries in M 31. We created a catalogue of
sources, detected in the 64 available observations, which add up to a total
exposure of about 1 Ms. We present a point-source catalogue, containing 318
X-ray sources with detailed long-term variability information, 28 of which are
published for the first time. The spatial and temporal resolution of the
catalogue allows us to classify 115 X-ray binary candidates showing high X-ray
variability or even outbursts in addition to 14 globular cluster X-ray binary
candidates showing no significant variability. The analysis may suggest, that
outburst sources are less frequent in globular clusters than in the field of M
31. We detected 7 supernova remnants, one of which is a new candidate and in
addition resolved the first X-rays from a known radio supernova remnant.
Besides 33 known optical nova/X-ray source correlations, we also discovered one
previously unknown super-soft X-ray outburst and several new nova candidates.
The catalogue contains a large sample of detailed long-term X-ray light curves
in the M 31 central field, which helps to understand the X-ray population of
our neighbouring spiral galaxy M 31.

Thanks to the presence of the Dresselhaus spin orbit coupling, the motion of
the hole along a certain direction is equivalent to the application of an
effective magnetic field which induces in turn a coherent rotation of the heavy
hole spin. The hole motion and consequently the quantum logic operation is
initialized only by weak static voltages applied to the electrodes which cover
the nanodevice. The proposed gates allow for an all electric and ultrafast

implement a scalable architecture of heavy hole spin qubits for quantum

  Simple, optimal and space-saving convex hull algorithms","15 pages, 11 figures",,,,"cs.CG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Convex hulls are a fundamental geometric tool used in a number of algorithms.
A famous paper by Akl and Toussaint in 1978 described a way to reduce the
number of points involved in the computation, which is since known as the
Akl-Toussaint heuristics. This paper first studies what this heurstics really
represents in terms of reduction of points and demonstrates that the optimum
selection is reached using an octogon as the remaining number of points is in
O(sqrt(N)) rather than the usual O(N). Then it focuses on optimising the
overall computational efficiency in a convex hull computation. Although the
heuristics is usually used as a first step in computations one can obtain the
convex hull directly from the heuristics's basis. First a simple incremental
implementation is described, and if the number of characteristic points of the
Akl-Toussaint heuristics p is taken as a parametre the convex hull is then
computed in a O(N(p+h/p)) average complexity or O(Nh) asymptotic complexity.
Given the relative constant factor of 1/p however experimental results show
that this algorithm should be considered linear in average. Worst-case
complexity is in O(N^2) and space complexity is O(h) but could be O(1) if the
required output is the array of convex vertices's indexes. Then a remark on why
the basic incremental method should be preferred for average cases is made.
Finally an optimal linear algorithm both in average and worst-case and using a
minimal space complexity in O(sqrt(N)) in average (or O(1) if in-place
computation is allowed) is presented.

the black hole horizon as a measure of distortion. The resulting symplectic
structure on the horizon coincides with the one of higher-dimensional
SO(2(n+1))-Chern-Simons theory in terms of a Peldan-type hybrid connection and
resembles closely the usual treatment in 3+1 dimensions. We comment briefly on
a possible quantisation of the horizon theory. Here, some subtleties arise
since higher-dimensional non-Abelian Chern-Simons theory has local degrees of
freedom. However, when replacing the natural generalisation to higher
dimensions of the usual boundary condition by an equally natural stronger one,
it is conceivable that the problems originating from the local degrees of
freedom are avoided, thus possibly resulting in a finite entropy.

with much small statistical error. Because of the small error, it is no longer
easy to fit the data with a single dark matter for a fixed diffusion model and
dark matter profile. In this paper, we propose a new interpretation of the data
that it originates from decay of two dark matter. This interpretation gives a
rough threshold of the lighter DM component. When DM decays into leptons, the
positron fraction in the cosmic ray depends on the flavor of the final states,
and this is fixed by imposing non-Abelian discrete symmetry in our model. By
assuming two gauge-singlet fermionic decaying DM particles, we show that a
model with non-Abelian discrete flavor symmetry, e.g. $T_{13}$, can give a much
better fitting to the AMS-02 data compared with single dark matter scenario.
Few dimension six operators of universal leptonic decay of DM particles are
allowed in our model since its decay operators are constrained by the $T_{13}$
symmetry. We also show that the lepton masses and mixings are consistent with
current experimental data, due to the flavor symmetry.

goodput over the path. This problem is formulated as a constrained optimization
of transmission power and link selection, which is proved to be NP-hard.
Nevertheless, we show that efficient algorithms exist to compute both exact and

approximation of polynomial complexity. Simulation results are also provided to
show the utility of our algorithms and quantify their energy savings compared
to a combination of (standard) security-agnostic minimum energy routing and

significant differences in disk spectra, and should therefore be detectable

onto a rapidly rotating, magnetized star accreting in the propeller regime. The
stellar magnetosphere corotates with the star, forming a centrifugal barrier at
the disc-magnetosphere boundary which inhibits matter accretion onto the star.
Instead, the disc matter accumulates at the disc-magnetosphere interface and
slowly diffuses into the inner magnetosphere where it picks up angular momentum
and is quickly ejected from the system as an outflow. Due to the interaction of
the matter with the magnetosphere, this wind is discontinuous and is launched
as discrete plasmoids. If the ejection rate is lower than the disc accretion
rate, the matter accumulates at the disc-magnetosphere boundary faster than it
can be ejected. In this case, accretion onto the star proceeds through the
episodic accretion instability in which episodes of matter accumulation are
followed by simultaneous accretion and ejection. During the accretion phase of
this instability in which matter flows onto the star in funnel streams, we
observe a corresponding rise in the outflow rate. Both the accretion and
ejection processes observed in our simulations are highly non-stationary. The
stars undergo strong spin-down due to the coupling of the stellar field with
the disc and corona and we measure the spin-down timescales of around 1 Myr for
a typical CTTS in the propeller regime.

emittances were measured with a corresponding bunch length of 2.1 +/- 0.1 (3.0
+/- 0.2) ps, respectively. In each case the rms momentum spread was determined
to be on the order of 1e-3. Excellent overall agreement between measurement and
simulation has been demonstrated. Using the emittances and bunch length
measured at 19 pC/bunch, we estimate the electron beam quality in a 1.3 GHz, 5
GeV hard x-ray ERL to be at least a factor of 20 times better than that of
existing storage rings when the rms energy spread of each device is considered.
These results represent a milestone for the field of high-brightness,
high-current photoinjectors.

enrichment in Hercules was governed by very massive stars, coupled with a very

the radial velocity based rotation estimator of Sch\""onrich, Binney & Asplund

the popular model and b) assess the reliability of the estimators. All four

duality in the rotation of sub-samples with different metallicities or at
different radii. We trace the rotation gradient across metallicity measured by
Deason et al. (2011) on a similar sample of BHB stars back to the inclusion of

supersymmetry broken at an intermediate or high energy scale with tan(beta)=1

to explore the structure of these objects and their gap-opening mechanism, we
observed the pre-transitional disk V1247 Orionis using the Very Large Telescope
Interferometer, the Keck Interferometer, Keck-II, Gemini South, and IRTF. This
allows us spatially resolve the AU-scale disk structure from near- to
mid-infrared wavelengths (1.5 to 13 {\mu}m), tracing material at different
temperatures and over a wide range of stellocentric radii. Our observations
reveal a narrow, optically-thick inner-disk component (located at 0.18 AU from
the star) that is separated from the optically thick outer disk (radii >46 AU),
providing unambiguous evidence for the existence of a gap in this
pre-transitional disk. Surprisingly, we find that the gap region is filled with
significant amounts of optically thin material with a carbon-dominated dust
mineralogy. The presence of this optically thin gap material cannot be deduced
solely from the spectral energy distribution, yet it is the dominant
contributor at mid-infrared wavelengths. Furthermore, using Keck/NIRC2 aperture
masking observations in the H, K', and L' band, we detect asymmetries in the
brightness distribution on scales of about 15-40 AU, i.e. within the gap
region. The detected asymmetries are highly significant, yet their amplitude
and direction changes with wavelength, which is not consistent with a companion
interpretation but indicates an inhomogeneous distribution of the gap material.
We interpret this as strong evidence for the presence of complex density
structures, possibly reflecting the dynamical interaction of the disk material
with sub-stellar mass bodies that are responsible for the gap clearing.

whether one could find a measurement technique for detecting the presence of a
torsion field. Mao et al.(2007) claimed that the rotating quartz balls in the
gyroscopes of the Gravity Probe B experiment, falling freely on an orbit around
the Earth, should ""feel"" the torsion. Similarly, March et al.(2011) argue with
the precession of the Moon and the Mercury and extend later their
considerations to the Lageos satellite.--- A consistent theory of gravity with
torsion emerged during the early 1960's as gauge theory of the Poincar\'e
group. This Poincar\'e gauge theory of gravity incorporates as simplest viable
cases the Einstein-Cartan(-Sciama-Kibble) theory (EC), the teleparallel
equivalent GR|| of GR, and GR itself. So far, PG and, in particular, the
existence of torsion have {\it not} been experimentally confirmed. However, PG
is to be considered as the standard theory of gravity with torsion because of
its very convincing gauge structure.--- Since the early 1970s up to today,
different groups have shown more or less independently that torsion couples
only to the {\it elementary particle spin} and under no circumstances to the
orbital angular momentum of test particles. This is established knowledge and
we reconfirm this conclusion by discussing the energy-momentum law of PG, which
has same form for all versions of PG. Therefore, we conclude that,
unfortunately, the investigations of Mao et al. and March et al. do not yield

efficient chemical enrichment timescales (tau2~1Gyr). In contrast, the
stellar-to-dynamical mass ratio - which, in principle, would track the
efficiency of feedback in the baryonic processes driving galaxy formation -
does not appear to correlate with the model parameters. On the Tully-Fisher
plane, no significant age segregation is found at fixed circular speed, whereas
at fixed stellar-to-dynamical mass fraction, age splits the sample, with older
galaxies having faster circular speeds at fixed Ms/Mdyn. Although our model

used the zCOSMOS 20k data to create a sample of galaxies at z<1. We divided the
sample in several mass-redshift bins to obtain stacked galaxy spectra with an
improved S/N. We exploited emission-line diagnostic diagrams to separate AGN
from star-forming galaxies. We found indication of a role for the total galaxy
stellar mass in leading galaxy classification. Stacked spectra show AGN
signatures above the log M_*/M_sun>10.2 threshold. Moreover, the stellar
populations of AGN hosts are found to be older with respect to star-forming and
composites galaxies. This could be due to the the tendency of AGN to reside in
massive hosts. The dependence of the AGN classification on the stellar mass is
in agreement with what has been already found in previous studies. It is
consistent with, together with the evidence of older stellar populations
inhabiting the AGN-like galaxies, the downsizing scenario. In particular, our
evidence points to an evolutionary scenario where the AGN-feedback is capable
of quenching the star formation in the most massive galaxies. Therefore, the
AGN-feedback is the best candidate for initiating the passive evolutionary
phase of galaxies.

responsible for powering the light curves of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), gamma
rays themselves are of particular interest as a diagnostic tool because they
provide a direct way to obtain deeper insights into the nucleosynthesis and the
kinematics of these explosion events. Focusing on two of the most broadly
discussed SN Ia progenitor scenarios - a delayed detonation in a
Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf (WD) and a violent merger of two WDs - we use
three-dimensional explosion models and perform radiative transfer simulations
to obtain synthetic gamma-ray spectra. Both chosen models produce the same mass
of 56Ni and have similar optical properties that are in reasonable agreement
with the recently observed supernova SN 2011fe. In contrast to the optical
regime, the gamma-ray emission of our two chosen models proves to be rather
different. The almost direct connection of the emission of gamma rays to
fundamental physical processes occuring in SNe Ia permits additional
constraints concerning several explosion model properties that are not easily
accessible within other wavelength ranges. Proposed future MeV missions such as
GRIPS will resolve all spectral details only for nearby SNe Ia, but hardness
ratio and light curve measurements still allow for a distinction of the two
different models at 10 and 16 Mpc for an exposure time of 10^6 s, respectively.
The possibility to detect the strongest line features up to the Virgo distance
will offer the opportunity to build up a first sample of SN Ia detections in
the gamma-ray energy range and underlines the importance of future space
observatories for MeV gamma rays.

be precluded by localization in a quasiperiodic lattice system. Here we
undertake complementary single-particle and many-body analyses of
noninteracting spinless fermions and hard-core bosons within the Aubry-Andre

localized and delocalized regimes of the quasiperiodic system, as well as the
critical point separating the two. Considering first the case of spinless
fermions, we study the dynamics of the momentum distribution function and
characterize the effects of real-space and momentum-space localization on the
relevant single-particle wave functions and correlation functions. We show that
although some observables do not relax in the delocalized and localized
regimes, the observables that do relax in these regimes do so in a manner
consistent with a recently proposed Gaussian equilibration scenario, whereas
relaxation at the critical point has a more exotic character. We also construct
various statistical ensembles from the many-body eigenstates of the fermionic

left-invariant pseudo-Riemannian (or, respectively, holomorphic) Einstein

symmetric 2-tensors, with the factor chosen so that \Omega\beta=2\beta. The
result of Meyberg [8], describing the spectrum of \Omega\ in complex simple Lie

the kernel of \Lambda, which is another natural operator. This in turn leads to
a proof of a known, yet unpublished, fact: namely, that a semisimple real or

classical trust-region framework for optimization of deterministic smooth
general nonlinear functions. Our method and setting differs from many
stochastic optimization approaches in two principal ways. Firstly, we assume
that the value of the function itself can be computed without noise, in other
words, that the function is deterministic. Secondly, we use random models of
higher quality than those produced by usual stochastic gradient methods. In
particular, a first order model based on random approximation of the gradient
is required to provide sufficient quality of approximation with probability
greater than or equal to 1/2. This is in contrast with stochastic gradient
approaches, where the model is assumed to be ""correct"" only in expectation. As
a result of this particular setting, we are able to prove convergence, with
probability one, of a trust-region method which is almost identical to the
classical method. Hence we show that a standard optimization framework can be
used in cases when models are random and may or may not provide good
approximations, as long as ""good"" models are more likely than ""bad"" models. Our
results are based on the use of properties of martingales. Our motivation comes
from using random sample sets and interpolation models in derivative-free
optimization. However, our framework is general and can be applied with any
source of uncertainty in the model. We discuss various applications for our
methods in the paper.

ordinary differential equations, and yet to date, only a small subset of these
methods have been explored as a tool for solving partial differential equations
(PDEs). This large class of time integrators include all popular (multistage)
Runge-Kutta as well as single-step (multiderivative) Taylor methods. (The
latter are commonly referred to as Lax-Wendroff methods when applied to PDEs.)
In this work, we offer explicit multistage multiderivative time integrators for
hyperbolic conservation laws. Like Lax-Wendroff methods, multiderivative
integrators permit the evaluation of higher derivatives of the unknown in order
to decrease the memory footprint and communication overhead. Like traditional
Runge-Kutta methods, multiderivative integrators admit the addition of extra
stages, which introduce extra degrees of freedom that can be used to increase
the order of accuracy or modify the region of absolute stability. We describe a
general framework for how these methods can be applied to two separate spatial
discretizations: the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method and the finite
difference essentially non-oscillatory (FD-WENO) method. The two proposed
implementations are substantially different: for DG we leverage techniques that
are closely related to generalized Riemann solvers; for FD-WENO we construct
higher spatial derivatives with central differences. Among multiderivative time
integrators, we argue that multistage two-derivative methods have the greatest
potential for multidimensional applications, because they only require the flux
function and its Jacobian, which is readily available. Numerical results
indicate that multiderivative methods are indeed competitive with popular
strong stability preserving time integrators.

1ES 1959+650 from 2007 October 18 to 2011 May 5 is presented. The source showed
a maximum and minimum brightness states in the R-band of 14.08$\pm$0.03 mag and
15.20$\pm$0.03 mag, respectively, with a maximum variation of 1.12 mag, and
also a maximum polarization degree of $P=$(12.2$\pm$0.7)%, with a maximum
variation of 10.7%. From August to November 2009, a correlation between the
optical $R$-band flux and the degree of linear polarization was found, with a
correlation coefficient $r_{pol}$=0.984$\pm$0.025. The source presented a
preferential position angle of optical polarization of $\sim153^{\circ}$, with
variations of $10\degr$-$50\degr$, that is in agreement with the projected
position angle of the parsec scale jet found at 43 GHz. From the Stokes
parameters we infer the existence of two optically-thin synchrotron components
that contribute to the polarized flux. One of them is stable, with a constant
polarization degree of 4%. Assuming a stationary shock for the variable
component, we estimated some parameters associated with the physics of the
relativistic jet: the magnetic field, $B\sim$0.06 G, the Doppler factor,
$\delta_{0}\sim$23, the viewing angle, $\Phi\sim2.4\degr$, and the size of the
emission region $r_b\sim5.6\times10^{17}$ cm. Our study is consistent with the
spine-sheath model to explain the polarimetric variability displayed by this
source during our monitoring.

its fitness relative to cloning and result in its extinction. Instead, sex is
widespread and it is clonal species that face early obsolescence. One possible
reason is that sex is an adaptation to resist ubiquitous parasites, which
evolve rapidly and potentially antagonistically. We use a heuristic approach to
model mutation-selection in finite populations where a parasitic haploid mounts
a negative frequency-dependent attack on a diploid host. The host evolves
reflexively to reduce parasitic load. Both host and parasite populations
generate novel alleles by mutation and have access to large allele spaces. Sex
outcompetes cloning by two overlapping mechanisms. First, sexual diploids adopt
advantageous homozygous mutations more rapidly than clonal diploids under
conditions of lag load. This rate advantage can offset the lesser fecundity of
sex. Second, a relative advantage to sex emerges under host mutation rates that
are fast enough to retain fitness in a rapidly mutating parasite environment
and increase host polymorphism. Clonal polymorphic populations
disproportionately experience interference with selection at high mutation
rates, both between and within loci. This slows clonal population adaptation to
a changing parasite environment and reduces clonal population fitness relative
to sex. The interference increases markedly with the number of loci under
independent selection. Rates of parasite mutation exist that not only allow sex
to survive despite the two-fold cost of males but which enable sexual and
clonal populations to have equal fitness and co-exist. Since all higher
organisms carry parasitic loads, the model is of general applicability.

elementary five-fold Cu2+ unit features an hourglass structure of two
corner-sharing scalene triangles related by inversion symmetry. Our microscopic
Heisenberg model comprises one ferromagnetic and two antiferromagnetic exchange
couplings in each triangle, stabilizing a single spin S=1/2 doublet ground
state (GS), with an exactly vanishing zero-field splitting (by Kramer's
theorem), and a very large excitation gap of \Delta~68 K. Thus, Cu5-NIPA is a
good candidate for achieving long electronic spin relaxation (T1) and coherence
(T2) times at low temperatures, in analogy to other nanomagnets with low-spin
GS's. Of particular interest is the strongly inhomogeneous distribution of the
GS magnetic moment over the five Cu2+ spins. This is a purely
quantum-mechanical effect since, despite the non-frustrated nature of the
magnetic couplings, the GS is far from the classical collinear ferrimagnetic
configuration. Finally, Cu5-NIPA is a rare example of a S=1/2 nanomagnet

effects models (including nonlinear mixed effects models or NLME models) due to
the fact that cross-validation requires ""out-of-sample"" predictions of the
outcome variable, which cannot be easily calculated when random effects are
present. We describe two novel variants of cross-validation that can be applied
to nonlinear mixed effects models. One variant, where out-of-sample predictions
are based on post hoc estimates of the random effects, can be used to select
the overall structural model. Another variant, where cross-validation seeks to
minimize the estimated random effects rather than the estimated residuals, can
be used to select covariates to include in the model. We show that these
methods produce accurate results in a variety of simulated data sets and apply
them to two publicly available population pharmacokinetic data sets.

The steep-spectrum radio quasars (SSRQs) are powerful radio sources,
with thermal emission from accretion disk and jet nonthermal emission likely
both contributing in the Ultraviolet (UV)/optical luminosity, however the
former may play a dominant role. While the UV/optical variability of SSRQs has
been poorly studied, little is known on the mechanism of their variability.
Aims. We investigate the mechanism of the UV/optical variability of SSRQs.
Methods. A sample of eighteen SSRQs has been established in SDSS Stripe 82
region in our previous works, in which the flux and spectral variability have
been studied. In this work, we construct the flux-flux diagram using SDSS u and
i multi-epoch data for these eighteen SSRQs. The standard accretion disk model
is used to fit the flux-flux variations, in order to explore the variability
mechanism. Results. The model fit to flux-flux diagram are tuned with fixed
black hole mass and varying accretion rate. We found that the flux-flux diagram
of all our SSRQs can be qualitatively described by the standard accretion disk
model with change of the accretion rate. Although non-thermal jet power-law
emission can also qualitatively reproduce the variability, the reasonable
accretion rates and black hole masses required to fit the flux-flux variations
suggest that a disk emission with variable accretion rate is a plausible
description of the data.

of CH+ in the J=1 excited rotational level and the A^2Delta <-- X^2Pi
transition of CH in the J=3/2 excited fine structure level have been analyzed.
These excited levels are above their ground levels by 40.1 K and ~25.7 K and
indicate high radiative temperatures of the environment, 14.6 K and 6.7 K,
respectively. The effect of the high radiative temperature is more spectacular
in some diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) observed toward Her 36; remarkable
extended tails toward red (ETR) were observed. We interpret these ETRs as due
to a small decrease of rotational constants upon excitation of excited
electronic states. Along with radiative pumping of a great many high-J
rotational levels, this causes the ETRs. In order to study this effect
quantitatively, we have developed a model calculation in which the effects of
collision and radiation are treated simultaneously. The simplest case of linear
molecules is considered. It has been found that the ETR is reproduced if the
fraction of the variation of the rotational constant, beta = (B'-B)/B, is
sufficiently high (3-5%) and the radiative temperature is high (T_r > 50 K).
Although modeling for general molecules is beyond the scope of this paper, the
results indicate that the prototypical DIBs at 5780.5, 5797.1, and 6613.6 A
which show the pronounced ETRs are due to polar molecules sensitive to the
radiative excitation. The requirement of high beta favors relatively small
molecules with 3-6 heavy atoms. DIBs at 5849.8, 6196.0, and 6379.3 A which do
not show the pronounced ETRs are likely due to non-polar molecules or large
polar molecules with small beta.

7.1 hr modulation was found in the soft X-ray, UV, optical and near-IR data,

system has a near-main sequence secondary, with little appreciable stellar
wind. This distinguishes it from the first GeV nova, V407 Cyg, where the
gamma-rays were proposed to form through shock-accelerated particles as the
ejecta interacted with the red giant wind. We favor a model in which the
gamma-rays arise from the shock of the ejecta with material close to the white
dwarf in the orbital plane. This suggests that classical novae may commonly be
GeV sources. We ascribe the orbital modulation to a raised section of an
accretion disk passing through the line of sight, periodically blocking and
reflecting much of the emission. The disk must, therefore, have reformed by day

linear combination of symmetric and antisymmetric fields (see 'A+B' in the
inset of Fig. 1(a)). They also insisted that they could find a complete set of
magnonic bands based on all of the mode symmetries. However, their work does
not constitute grounds for judging our method ""wrong"" and our conclusions
""erroneous"". Moreover, the excitation field alluded to in the Comment is not
sufficiently general to obtain the complete set of magnonic band structures,
but rather remains specific. The grounds of these conclusions, drawn from our
further work, are the following.

cannot be described well by a simple deterministic model. We perform a Bayesian
comparison of over 20 deterministic and stochastic models on 6304 QSO light
curves in SDSS Stripe 82. We include the damped random walk (or
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck [OU] process), a particular type of stochastic model which
recent studies have focused on. Further models we consider are single and
double sinusoids, multiple OU processes, higher order continuous autoregressive
processes, and composite models. We find that only 29 out of 6304 QSO
lightcurves are described significantly better by a deterministic model than a
stochastic one. The OU process is an adequate description of the vast majority
of cases (6023). Indeed, the OU process is the best single model for 3462 light
curves, with the composite OU process/sinusoid model being the best in 1706
cases. The latter model is the dominant one for brighter/bluer QSOs.
Furthermore, a non-negligible fraction of QSO lightcurves show evidence that
not only the mean is stochastic but the variance is stochastic, too. Our
results confirm earlier work that QSO light curves can be described with a
stochastic model, but place this on a firmer footing, and further show that the
OU process is preferred over several other stochastic and deterministic models.
Of course, there may well exist yet better (deterministic or stochastic) models

participants and evaluator alike. Initially, participants were at a loss as to
how to calibrate their systems, while the evaluator underestimated the required
number of evaluation trials. After the fact, it is now obvious that both
calibration and evaluation require very large sets of trials. This poses the
challenges of (i) how to decide what number of trials is enough, and (ii) how
to process such large data sets with reasonable memory and CPU requirements.
After SRE'10, at the BOSARIS Workshop, we built solutions to these problems
into the freely available BOSARIS Toolkit. This paper explains the principles
and algorithms behind this toolkit. The main contributions of the toolkit are:
1. The Normalized Bayes Error-Rate Plot, which analyses likelihood- ratio
calibration over a wide range of DCF operating points. These plots also help in
judging the adequacy of the sizes of calibration and evaluation databases. 2.
Efficient algorithms to compute DCF and minDCF for large score files, over the
range of operating points required by these plots. 3. A new score file format,
which facilitates working with very large trial lists. 4. A faster logistic
regression optimizer for fusion and calibration. 5. A principled way to define
EER (equal error rate), which is of practical interest when the absolute error
count is small.

difficulty of the proof lies in establishing the global in time $L^1$ estimate
for the velocity field due to the strong degeneracy and anisotropic spectral
properties of the linearized system. To achieve this and to avoid the
difficulty of propagating anisotropic regularity for the transport equation, we
first write our system \eqref{B1} in the Lagrangian formulation \eqref{B11}.
Then we employ anisotropic Littlewood-Paley analysis to establish the key $L^1$
in time estimates to the velocity and the gradient of the pressure in the
Lagrangian coordinate. With those estimates, we prove the global wellposedness
of \eqref{B11} with smooth and small initial data by using the energy method.
Toward this, we will have to use the algebraic structure of \eqref{B11} in a
rather crucial way. The global wellposedness of the original system \eqref{B1}
then follows by a suitable change of variables together with a continuous
argument. We should point out that compared with the linearized systems of 2-D
MHD equations in \cite{XLZMHD1} and that of the 3-D modified MHD equations in

are systematically enhanced due to masks, the larger the masked area, the
higher the enhancement. In the case with about $13\%$ of the total masked area,
the fraction of peaks with SNR $\nu\ge 3$ is $\sim 11\%$ in comparison with
$\sim 7\%$ of the mask-free case in our considered cosmological model. This can
induce a large bias on cosmological studies with weak lensing peak statistics.
Even for a survey area of $9\hbox{ deg}^2$, the bias in $(\Omega_m, \sigma_8)$
is already close to $3\sigma$. It is noted that most of the affected peaks are
close to the masked regions. Therefore excluding peaks in those regions can
reduce the bias but at the expense of loosing usable survey areas. Further
investigations find that the enhancement of high peaks number can be largely
attributed to higher noise led by the fewer number of galaxies usable in the
reconstruction. Based on Fan et al. (2010), we develop a model in which we
exclude only those large masks with radius larger than $3\arcmin. For the
remained part, we treat the areas close to and away from the masked regions
separately with different noise levels. It is shown that this two-noise-level
model can account for the mask effect on peak statistics very well and the
cosmological bias is significantly reduced.

near-infrared (NIR) have indicated the possibility that the local universe may
be under-dense on scales of several hundred megaparsecs. The presence of a
large-scale under-density in the local universe could introduce significant
biases into the interpretation of cosmological observables, and, in particular,
into the inferred effects of dark energy on the expansion rate. Here we measure
the K-band luminosity density as a function of redshift to test for such a
local under-density. In this effort, we combine photometry from UKIDSS and
2MASS with redshifts from the SDSS, 2DFGRS, 6DFGRS, 2MR, and GAMA surveys. We
find that the overall shape of the z=0 rest-frame K-band luminosity function
(M* = -22.15 +/- 0.04 and alpha = -1.02 +/- 0.03) appears to be relatively
constant as a function of environment and redshift out to z ~0.2. We find a
local (z < 0.07) luminosity density that is in good agreement with previous
studies. Beyond z ~ 0.07 we detect a rising luminosity density that reaches a
value ~1.5 times higher than that measured locally at z>0.1. This suggests that
the stellar mass density as a function of redshift follows a similar trend.
Assuming that luminous matter traces the underlying dark matter distribution,
this implies that the local mass density of the universe may be lower than the
global value on a scale and amplitude sufficient to introduce significant
biases into the determination of basic cosmological observables, such as the
expansion rate. An under-density of roughly this scale and amplitude would be
sufficient to resolve the apparent tension between direct measurements of the
Hubble constant and those inferred by Planck.

Aims: The key program Chemical HErschel Surveys of Star forming regions (CHESS)
aims at studying the molecular complexity of the interstellar medium. The high
sensitivity and spectral resolution of the Herschel/HIFI instrument provide a
unique opportunity to observe the fundamental 1_{1,1}-0_{0,0} transition of
ortho-D2O at 607 GHz and the higher energy 2_{1,2}-1_{0,1} transition of
para-D2O at 898 GHz, both of which are inaccessible from the ground. Methods:
The ortho-D2O transition at 607 GHz was previously detected. We present in this
paper the first tentative detection for the para-D2O transition at 898 GHz. The
spherical Monte Carlo radiative transfer code RATRAN was used to reproduce the
observed line profiles of D2O with the same method that was used to reproduce
the HDO and H2-18O line profiles in IRAS 16293-2422. Results: As for HDO, the
absorption component seen on the D2O lines can only be reproduced by adding an
external absorbing layer, possibly created by the photodesorption of the ices
at the edges of the molecular cloud. The D2O column density is found to be
about 2.5e12 cm^{-2} in this added layer, leading to a D2O/H2O ratio of about
0.5%. At a 3 sigma uncertainty, upper limits of 0.03% and 0.2% are obtained for
this ratio in the hot corino and the colder envelope of IRAS 16293-2422,
respectively. Conclusions: The deuterium fractionation derived in our study
suggests that the ices present in IRAS 16293-2422 formed on warm dust grains
(~15-20 K) in dense (~1e4-5e4 cm^{-3}) translucent clouds. These results allow
us to address the earliest phases of star formation and the conditions in which
ices form.

use of octree grids in Monte Carlo dust radiative transfer, with two different
octree construction algorithms (regular and barycentric subdivision) and three
different octree traversal algorithms (top-down, neighbour list, and the
bookkeeping method). In general, regular octree grids need higher levels of
subdivision compared to the barycentric grids for a fixed maximum cell mass
threshold criterion. The total number of grid cells, however, depends on the
geometry of the model. Surprisingly, regular octree grid simulations turn out
to be 10 to 20% more efficient in run time than the barycentric grid
simulations, even for those cases where the latter contain fewer grid cells
than the former. Furthermore, we find that storing neighbour lists for each
cell in an octree, ordered according to decreasing overlap area, is worth the
additional memory and implementation overhead: using neighbour lists can cut
down the grid traversal by 20% compared to the traditional top-down method. In
conclusion, the combination of a regular node subdivision and the neighbour
list method results in the most efficient octree structure for Monte Carlo
radiative transfer simulations.

we explore the parameter space of the concordance LCDM model using Monte Carlo
Markov Chains and the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 7yr and South Pole
Telescope data. We find marginal evidence of a contribution by diffuse gas,
with amplitudes of A_WHIM=10-20 muK^2, but the results are also compatible with
a null contribution from the WHIM, allowing to set an upper limit of A_WHIM <
43 muK^2 (95.4% C.L.). The signal produced by galaxy clusters remains at
A_CL=4.5 muK^2, a value similar to what is obtained when no WHIM is included.
From the measured WHIM amplitude we constrain the temperature-density phase
diagram of the diffuse gas, and find it to be compatible with numerical
simulations. The corresponding baryon fraction in the WHIM varies from 0.43 to
0.47, depending on model parameters. Planck data could set tighter constraints

class of non-Gaussian positive-definite matrix-valued random fields, adapted to
the statistical inverse problems in high stochastic dimension for their
experimental identification, is introduced and its properties are analyzed. A
minimal parametrization of discretized random fields belonging to this general
class is proposed. Using this parametrization of the general class, a complete
identification procedure is proposed. New results of the mathematical and
numerical analyzes of the parameterized stochastic elliptic boundary value
problem are presented. The numerical solution of this parametric stochastic
problem provides an explicit approximation of the application that maps the
parameterized general class of random fields to the corresponding set of random
solutions. This approximation can be used during the identification procedure
in order to avoid the solution of multiple forward stochastic problems. Since
the proposed general class of random fields possibly contains random fields
which are not uniformly bounded, a particular mathematical analysis is
developed and dedicated approximation methods are introduced. In order to
obtain an algorithm for constructing the approximation of a very
high-dimensional map, complexity reduction methods are introduced and are based
on the use of low-rank approximation methods that exploit the tensor structure
of the solution which results from the parametrization of the general class of

magnetic protection of tidally locked and unlocked planets is estimated by
combining simplified models of the planetary magnetosphere and a

a strong dependence of magnetic protection on planetary mass and rotation rate.
Tidally locked terrestrial planets with an Earth-like composition would have
early dayside magnetospause distances between 1.5 and 4.0 Rp, larger than
previously estimated. Unlocked planets with periods of rotation ~1 day are
protected by magnetospheres extending between 3 and 8 Rp. Our results are
robust against variations in planetary bulk composition and uncertainties in
other critical model parameters. For illustration purposes the thermal
evolution and magnetic protection of the potentially habitable super-Earths GL
581d, GJ 667Cc and HD 40307g were also studied. Assuming an Earth-like

a shift in the mean of a Gaussian distribution, an imaginary weak value is
exhibited in our scheme by a significantly slower-than-natural exponential
distribution of emitted photons at the postselected polarization, leading to a
large shift in their mean arrival time. The dynamics of spontaneous emission
offer a broader view of the measurement process than is usually considered
within the weak measurement formalism. Our scheme opens the path for the use of

the functional role of subgraph motifs. Our work aims to overcome this
limitation.
  We employ the framework of exponential random graphs (ERGMs) to define novel
models based on triadic substructures. The fact that only a small portion of
triads can actually be set independently poses a challenge for the formulation
of such models. To overcome this obstacle we use Steiner Triple Systems (STS).
These are partitions of sets of nodes into pair-disjoint triads, which thus can
be specified independently. Combining the concepts of ERGMs and STS, we suggest
novel generative models capable of generating ensembles of networks with
non-trivial triadic Z-score profiles. Further, we discover inevitable
correlations between the abundance of triad patterns, which occur solely for
statistical reasons and need to be taken into account when discussing the
functional implications of motif statistics. Moreover, we calculate the degree
distributions of our triadic random graphs analytically.

planets in M-dwarf systems using Transit Timing Variations (TTVs) and Transit
Timing Durations (TDVs) with Kepler-class photometry is investigated. Light
curves of systems with various configurations were simulated around M-dwarf
hosts of mass 0.5 Msun and radius 0.55 Rsun. Jupiter-like giant planets which
offer the best potential for hosting habitable exomoons were considered with
rocky super-Earth-mass moons. The detectability is measured by using the
phase-correlation between TTV and TDV signals. Since the TDV signal is
typically weaker than the TTV signal, confirmation of an exomoon detection will
depend on being able to detect a TDV signal. We find that exomoons around
planets orbiting within the habitable zone of an M-dwarf host star can produce
both detectable TTV and TDV signatures with Kepler-class photometry. While
aliasing between the planet period and moon period may hinder exomoon
detection, we also find some strong correlation signatures in our simulation
(eg. correlation: >0.7) which would provide convincing exomoon signatures. With
the addition of red noise stellar variability, correlations generally weaken.
However simulated examples with planet masses less than around 25 Mearth, moons
of mass 8-10 Mearth and specific values of planet and moon periods still yield
detectable correlation in 25-50% of cases. Our simulation indicates that Kepler
provides one of the best available opportunities for exomoon detection.

systematic way to characterise the normality zone, that is the zone in which
the Gaussian approximation for the tails is still valid. Besides, the residue
function measures the extent to which this approximation fails to hold at the
edge of the normality zone.

that unless cells permanently receive a ""Stay alive"" signal from their
neighbors, they are bound to die. A natural question is whether manifestations
of this apoptosis paradigm can also be observed in other organizations of
living organisms. In this paper we report results from a two-year long campaign
of experiments on three species of ants and one species of (tephritid) fruit
flies. In these experiments individuals were separated from their colony and
kept in isolation either alone or in groups of 10 individuals. The overall
conclusion is that ""singles"" have a shorter life expectancy than individuals in
the groups of 10. This observation holds for ants as well as for fruit flies.
The paper also provides compelling evidence of a similar effect in married
versus unmarried (i.e. single, widowed or divorced) people. A natural question
concerns the dynamic of the transition between the two regimes. Observation
suggests an abrupt (rather than smooth) transition and this conclusion seems to
hold for ants, fruit flies and humans as well. We call it a shock transition.
In addition, for red fire ants Solenopsis invicta, it was observed that
individuals in groups of 10 that also comprise one queen, die much faster than
those in similar groups without queens. The paper also examines the
corresponding survivorship curves from the perspective of the standard
classification into 3 types. The survivorship curves of ants (whether single or
in groups of 10) are found to be of type II whereas those of the fruit fly
Bactrocera dorsalis are rather of type III. In this connection it is recalled
that the survivorship curve of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is of type
I, i.e. of same type as for humans.

chemical evolution for elliptical and spiral galaxies, using the additional
constraints on the mean stellar ages of these galaxies (at a given mass). We
can conclude that the two phases of the sSFR evolution across cosmic time are
due to different populations of galaxies. At z>2 the contribution comes from
spheroids: the progenitors of present-day massive ellipticals (which feature
the highest sSFR) as well as halos and bulges in spirals (which contribute with
average and lower-than-average sSFR). In each single galaxy the sSFR decreases
rapidly and the star formation stops in <1 Gyr. However the combination of
different generations of ellipticals in formation might result in an apparent
lack of strong evolution of the sSFR (averaged over a population) at high
redshift. The z<2 decrease is due to the slow evolution of the gas fraction in
discs, modulated by the gas accretion history and regulated by the Schmidt law.
The Milky Way makes no exception to this behaviour.

high-mass star formation, we decompose high-resolution Herschel-HIFI line
spectra toward 19 high-mass star-forming regions into three distinct physical
components. Protostellar envelopes are usually seen as narrow absorptions or
emissions in the H2O 1113 and 1669 GHz ground-state lines, the H2O 987 GHz
excited-state line, and the H2O-18 1102 GHz ground-state line. Broader features
due to outflows are usually seen in absorption in the H2O 1113 and 1669 GHz
lines, in 987 GHz emission, and not seen in H2O-18, indicating a low column
density and a high excitation temperature. The H2O 1113 and 1669 GHz spectra
show narrow absorptions by foreground clouds along the line of sight, which
have a low column density and a low excitation temperature, although their H2O
ortho/para ratios are close to 3.
  The intensities of the H2O 1113 and 1669 GHz lines do not show significant
trends with luminosity, mass, or age. In contrast, the 987 GHz line flux
increases with luminosity and the H2O-18 line flux decreases with mass.
Furthermore, appearance of the envelope in absorption in the 987 GHz and H2O-18
lines seems to be a sign of an early evolutionary stage.
  We conclude that the ground state transitions of H2O trace the outer parts of
the envelopes, so that the effects of star formation are mostly noticeable in
the outflow wings. These lines are heavily affected by absorption, so that line
ratios of H2O involving the ground states must be treated with caution. The
average H2O abundance in high-mass protostellar envelopes does not change much
with time. The 987 GHz line appears to be a good tracer of the mean weighted
dust temperature of the source, which may explain why it is readily seen in
distant galaxies.

prevalence in natural and artificial systems [1]. In the field of photonics
most of the research has focused on understanding and mitigating the effects of
scattering, which are often detrimental. For certain applications, however,
intentionally introducing disorder can actually improve the device performance,
e.g., in photovoltaics optical scattering improves the efficiency of light
harvesting [2-5]. Here, we utilize multiple scattering in a random photonic
structure to build a compact on-chip spectrometer. The probe signal diffuses
through a scattering medium generating wavelength-dependent speckle patterns
which can be used to recover the input spectrum after calibration. Multiple
scattering increases the optical pathlength by folding the paths in a confined
geometry, enhancing the spectral decorrelation of speckle patterns and thus
increasing the spectral resolution. By designing and fabricating the
spectrometer on a silicon wafer, we are able to efficiently channel the
scattered light to the detectors, minimizing the reflection loss. We
demonstrate spectral resolution of 0.75 nm at a wavelength of 1500 nm in a 25

afforded by semiconductor nanofabrication technology enabled us to engineer the

well studied in general, here some hitherto unstudied cases are presented. An
analytical formula for the RRLA frequency is presented for infinite monoecious
population practicing several different types of inbreeding. In finite diecious
populations, it is found that more severe inbreeding leads to quicker RRLA
losses, making the upcoming generations healthier. A population of size 10,000
practicing 30% half-sib marriages loses more than 95% of its RRLA in 100

context of the leptohadronic one-zone model. We find that $\gamma$-ray emission
can be attributed to synchrotron radiation either from protons or from
secondary leptons produced via photohadronic processes. These possibilities
imply differences not only in the spectral energy distribution (SED) but also
in the variability signatures, especially in the X- and $\gamma$-ray regime.
Thus, the temporal behavior of each leptohadronic scenario can be used to probe
the particle population responsible for the high-energy emission as it can give
extra information not available by spectral fits. In the present work we apply
these ideas to the non-thermal emission of Mrk 421. We focus on the
observations of March 2001, since during that period Mrk 421 showed multiple
flares that have been observed in detail both in X-rays and $\gamma$-rays.
First, we obtain pre-flaring fits to the SED using the different types of
leptohadronic scenarios. Then, we introduce random-walk type, small-amplitude
variations on the injection compactness or on the maximum energy of radiating
particles and follow the subsequent response of the radiated photon spectrum.
For each leptohadronic scenario, we calculate the X-ray and $\gamma$-ray fluxes
and investigate their possible correlation. Whenever the `input' variations
lead, apart from flux variability, also to spectral variability, we present the
resulting relations between the spectral index and the flux, both in X-rays and
$\gamma$-rays. We find that proton synchrotron models are favoured
energetically but require fine tuning between electron and proton parameters to
reproduce the observed quadratic behaviour between X-rays and TeV
$\gamma-$rays. On the other hand, models based on pion-decay can reproduce this
behaviour in a much more natural way.

turbulence. Current sheets form self-consistently from the wave-driven
turbulence, and their filling fraction is well correlated to the electron
heating rate. However, the weakly collisional nature of the simulation
necessarily implies that the current sheets are not significantly dissipated
via Ohmic dissipation. Rather, collisionless damping via the Landau resonance
with the electrons is sufficient to account for the measured heating as a
function of scale in the simulation, without the need for significant Ohmic
dissipation. This finding suggests the possibility that the dissipation of the
current sheets is governed by resonant wave-particle interactions and that the
locations of current sheets correspond spatially to regions of enhanced
heating.

involving the charged scalar and the Higgs boson gives rise to interactions
between the dark matter and SM quarks at the one-loop level, which induce the
elastic scatterings between dark matter and nucleus. The same term also affects
the effective coupling of the Higgs boson to diphoton through a one-loop
diagram with the charged scalar. Therefore, our model predicts a correlation
between the spin-independent cross section for dark matter-nucleus elastic
scatterings and a new contribution to the effective Higgs boson coupling to
diphoton. When the spin-dependent cross section is large enough to be tested in
future direct dark matter detection experiments, the Higgs-diphoton decay rate
shows a sizable deviation from the SM prediction. We also consider the case
where the fermion dark matter is a Dirac particle. Most of discussions is
similar to the Majorana case, but we find that the magnetic dipole moment of
the Dirac fermion dark matter is loop-induced and this interaction dominates
the spin-independent cross section for dark matter-nucleus elastic scatterings.

  In this paper, we present results from a multi-year study of the online

presence of a bosonic bath. This approach allows us to go beyond the standard
stochastic error model commonly used to quantify decoherence and error
threshold probabilities in this system. The full quantum mechanical system-bath
dynamics is computed exactly over one quantum error correction cycle. Since all
physical qubits interact with the bath, space-time correlations between errors
are taken into account. We compute the fidelity of the surface code as a
function of the quantum error correction time. The calculation allows us to map
the problem onto an Ising-like statistical spin model with two-body
interactions and a fictitious temperature which is related to the inverse bath
coupling constant. The model departs from the usual Ising model in the sense
that interactions can be long ranged and can involve complex exchange
couplings; in addition, the number of allowed configurations is restricted by
the syndrome extraction. Using analytical estimates and numerical calculations,
we argue that, in the limit of an infinite number of physical qubits, the spin
model sustain a phase transition which can be associated to the existence of an
error threshold in the surface code. An estimate of the transition point is
given for the case of nearest-neighbor interactions.

distribution functions of the model parameters. When considering each system
separately, we find there is no preference for one of these specific parametric
density profiles. However, the combined evidence shows that it is unlikely that
all galaxies are embedded in the same type of cored profiles of the form
\rho_{DM} \propto 1/(1 + r^2)^{\beta/2}, where \beta = 3, 4. For each galaxy,
we also obtain an almost model independent, and therefore accurate, measurement
of the logarithmic slope of the dark matter density distribution at a radius ~
r_{-3}, i.e. where the logarithmic slope of the stellar density profile is -3.
This slope ranges from ~ -1.4 for Fornax to ~ -1.1 for Sextans, both at ~ 1
kpc. All our best fit models essentially have the same mass distribution over a
large range in radius (from just below r_{-3} to the last measured data point).

have in order to host the dSph galaxies around the Milky Way.

models for field extrapolation in the low corona. Recently we have developed a
new NLFFF model with MHD relaxation to reconstruct the coronal magnetic field.
This method is based on CESE--MHD model with the
conservation-element/solution-element (CESE) spacetime scheme. In this paper,
we report the application of the CESE--MHD--NLFFF code to \SDO/HMI data with
magnetograms sampled for two active regions (ARs), NOAA AR 11158 and 11283,
both of which were very non-potential, producing X-class flares and eruptions.
The raw magnetograms are preprocessed to remove the force and then inputted
into the extrapolation code. Qualitative comparison of the results with the
\SDO/AIA images shows that our code can reconstruct magnetic field lines
resembling the EUV-observed coronal loops. Most important structures of the
active regions are reproduced excellently, like the highly-sheared field lines
that suspend filaments in AR 11158 and twisted flux rope which corresponds to a
sigmoid in AR 11283. Quantitative assess of the results shows that the
force-free constraint is fulfilled very well in the strong-field regions but
apparently not that well in the weak-field regions because of data noise and
numerical errors in the small currents.

prove an approximation guarantee of 9. It uses the standard LP relaxation and
comes close to settling the integrality gap (after necessary preprocessing),

reducing to special tree instances, and then solves such instances optimally.
Our concept of tree instances is quite versatile, and applies to natural

51 (2009) 339-360] for nonparametric regression. The trend filtering estimate
is defined as the minimizer of a penalized least squares criterion, in which
the penalty term sums the absolute $k$th order discrete derivatives over the
input points. Perhaps not surprisingly, trend filtering estimates appear to
have the structure of $k$th degree spline functions, with adaptively chosen
knot points (we say ``appear'' here as trend filtering estimates are not really
functions over continuous domains, and are only defined over the discrete set
of inputs). This brings to mind comparisons to other nonparametric regression
tools that also produce adaptive splines; in particular, we compare trend
filtering to smoothing splines, which penalize the sum of squared derivatives
across input points, and to locally adaptive regression splines [Ann. Statist.
25 (1997) 387-413], which penalize the total variation of the $k$th derivative.
Empirically, we discover that trend filtering estimates adapt to the local
level of smoothness much better than smoothing splines, and further, they
exhibit a remarkable similarity to locally adaptive regression splines. We also
provide theoretical support for these empirical findings; most notably, we
prove that (with the right choice of tuning parameter) the trend filtering
estimate converges to the true underlying function at the minimax rate for
functions whose $k$th derivative is of bounded variation. This is done via an
asymptotic pairing of trend filtering and locally adaptive regression splines,
which have already been shown to converge at the minimax rate [Ann. Statist. 25
(1997) 387-413]. At the core of this argument is a new result tying together
the fitted values of two lasso problems that share the same outcome vector, but
have different predictor matrices.

that, in the strongly interacting limit, spin-up and spin-down particles want
to separate in the trap, which we interpret as a microscopic precursor of
one-dimensional ferromagnetism in imbalanced systems. Our predictions are
directly addressable in current experiments on ultracold atomic few-body

stability parameter $\al$, is one of the most classical extensions of the
well-known Gaussian Fractional Brownian Motion (FBM), to the setting of
heavy-tailed stable distributions \cite{SamTaq,EmMa}. In order to overcome some
limitations of its areas of application, coming from stationarity of its
increments as well as constancy over time of its self-similarity exponent,
Stoev and Taqqu introduced in \cite{stoev2004stochastic} an extension of LFSM,
called Linear Multifractional Stable Motion (LMSM), in which the Hurst
parameter becomes a function $H(\cdot)$ depending on the time variable $t$.
Similarly to LFSM, the tail heaviness of the marginal distributions of LMSM is
determined by $\al$; also, under some conditions, its self-similarity is
governed by $H(\cdot)$ and its path roughness is closely related to
$H(\cdot)-1/\al$. Namely, it was shown in \cite{stoev2004stochastic} that
$H(t_0)$ is the self-similarity exponent of LMSM at a time $t_0\neq 0$;
moreover, very recently, it was established in \cite{hamonier2012lmsm}, that
the quantities $\min_{t\in I} H(t)-1/\al$, and $H(t_0)-1/\al$, are respectively
the uniform H\""older exponent of LMSM on a compact interval $I$, and its local
H\""older exponent at $t_0$.
  The main goal of our article, is to construct, using wavelet coefficients of
LMSM, strongly consistent (i.e. almost surely convergent) statistical
estimators of $\min_{t\in I} H(t)$, $H(t_0)$, and $\al$; our estimation
results, are obtained when $\al\in (1,2)$, and, $H(\cdot)$ is a H\""older
function smooth enough, with values in a compact subinterval
$[\underline{H},\bar{H}]$ of $(1/\al,1)$.

as polynomials of logarithms of ratios of squares of the external momenta with
certain coefficients. We also showed that these coefficients have a
combinatoric origin. In this paper, we present an explicit formula for these
coefficients. The procedure of recovering the coefficients is based on taking
the double-uniform limit in certain series of smooth functions of two variables
which is constructed according to a pre-determined iterative way. The result is
obtained by using basic methods of mathematical analysis. We observe that the
finiteness of the limit of this iterative chain of smooth functions should
reflect itself in other mathematical constructions, too, since it is not
related in any way to the explicit form of the MB transforms. This finite
double-uniform limit is represented in terms of a differential operator with
respect to an auxiliary parameter which acts on the integrand of a certain
two-fold MB integral. To demonstrate that our result is compatible with
original representations of UD functions, we reproduce the integrands of these
original integral representations by applying this differential operator to the
integrand of the simple integral representation of the scalar triangle

measure belonging to the spaces onto which these distances are defined.

that generically depicts the dominant transport mechanism in cooperative strong
electron-phonon interaction systems. Using analytic and numerical approaches,
hard-core-bosons are shown to typically undergo a striking discontinuous
transition from a superfluid to a supersolid. Topological inequivalence of
rings with even and odd number of sites is manifested through observable
differences (in structure factor peaks) at the transition. Connections are also
identified between the $t_2-V$ model and other topologically interesting
models.

Technology, Ghana. The system facilitates efficient management and location of
instruments, as well as easy location of beacons together with their attribute
information, it provides multimedia information about instruments in an
Equipment Store. Digital camera was used capture the pictorial descriptions of
the beacons. Geographic Information System software was employed to visualize
the spatial location of beacons and to publish the various layers for the
Graphical User Interface. The aesthetics of the interface was developed with
user interface design tools and coded by programming. The developed Suite,
powered by a reliable and fully scalable database, provides an efficient way of
booking and analyzing transactions in an Equipment Store.

of fortification cloud users and cloud resources services against security
infringements. Based on analysis of current cloud computing security
characteristics, the preamble of the concept of trust, role-based access
control policy, combined with the characteristics of the cloud computing
environment, there are multiple security management domains, so a new cross
domain framework is for access control is proposed which is based on trust. It
will establish and calculate the degree of trust in the single as well as
multiple domains. Role Based Access Control is used for the implementation of
the access control policies in a single domain environment with the
introduction of the trust concept. In multiple domains the access control will
be based on the conversion of roles. On the basis of trust, and role based
access control model, a new novel framework of flexible cross domain access
control framework is presented. The role assignment and conversion will take
place dynamically.

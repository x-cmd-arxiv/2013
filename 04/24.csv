this flare, the radio spectral index becomes harder. Other smaller flares occur
along with the X-ray timing transition, and also right after the detection of

using the simultaneous broadband X-ray spectra including INTEGRAL, we find that
a high energy cut-off with a folding energy near 250 keV is necessary around
the time that the compact jet is forming. The broad band spectrum can be fitted
equally well with a Comptonization model. In addition, using photoelectric
absorption edges in the XMM-Newton RGS X-ray spectra and the extinction of red

non-perturbative version of quantum Einstein gravity, numerical simulations
without matter have shown two phases, with spacetimes that are either crumpled

transition between them. These properties have generally been considered
unphysical. Using previously unpublished numerical results, we give an
interpretation in terms of continuum spacetimes that have constant positive and
negative curvature, respectively in the 'elongated' and 'crumpled' phase. The
magnitude of the positive curvature leads naturally to average spacetimes
consisting solely of baby-universes in a branched-polymer structure, whereas
the negative curvature accommodates easily a large mother universe, albeit with
a crumpling singularity. Nevertheless, there is evidence for scaling in the
crumpled phase, which we compare with the well-known scaling in the elongated
phase. Using constraint effective-action models we analyze existing numerical
susceptibility-data of the phase transition and determine the behavior of the
average Regge-curvature. We propose a renormalization of the Regge curvature
and compare it to the curvature of the above continuum spacetimes, and also to
the curvature implied by the Gauss-Bonnet theorem in the continuum. The latter
involves a more benign multiplicative renormalization and suggests that
simulations at larger volumes are needed to settle the order of the phase

the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry of low-energy QCD. In the low-energy
limit, for energies and momenta small compared to a characteristic symmetry
breaking scale of order 1 GeV, QCD is realized as an effective field theory of
Goldstone bosons (pions) coupled to heavy fermionic sources (nucleons). Nuclear
forces at long and intermediate distance scales result from a systematic
hierarchy of one- and two-pion exchange processes in combination with Pauli
blocking effects in the nuclear medium. Short distance dynamics, not resolved
at the wavelengths corresponding to typical nuclear Fermi momenta, are
introduced as contact interactions between nucleons. Apart from a set of
low-energy constants associated with these contact terms, the parameters of
this theory are entirely determined by pion properties and low-energy
pion-nucleon scattering observables. This framework (in-medium chiral
perturbation theory) can provide a realistic description of both
isospin-symmetric nuclear matter and neutron matter. The importance of
three-body forces is emphasized, and the role of explicit Delta(1232)-isobar
degrees of freedom is investigated in detail. Nuclear chiral thermodynamics is
developed and a calculation of the nuclear phase diagram is performed. This
includes a successful description of the first-order phase transition from a
nuclear Fermi liquid to an interacting Fermi gas and the coexistence of these
phases below a critical temperature T_c. Density functional methods for finite
nuclei based on this approach are also discussed. Effective interactions, their
density dependence and connections to Landau Fermi liquid theory are outlined.
Finally, the density and temperature dependence of the chiral (quark)
condensate is investigated.

reason for using entropies as quantifiers; any functional relation that
characterizes the uncertainty of the measurement outcomes defines an
uncertainty relation. Starting from a very reasonable assumption of invariance
under mere relabelling of the measurement outcomes, we show that Schur-concave
functions are the most general uncertainty quantifiers. We then discover a
fine-grained uncertainty relation that is given in terms of the majorization
order between two probability vectors, \textcolor{black}{significantly

decay rate $|t|^{-3/4}$. We determine the shape of the light cone for any
choice of the mass parameter and relative propagation speeds along the two
coordinate axes. Fundamental solutions experience the least dispersion along
four caustic lines interior to the light cone rather than along its boundary,
and decay exponentially to arbitrary order outside the light cone. The overall
geometry of the propagation pattern and its associated dispersive bounds are
independent of the particular choice of parameters. In particular there is no
bifurcation of the number or type of caustics that are present.
  The discrete Klein-Gordon equation is a classical analogue of the quantum
harmonic lattice. In the quantum setting, commutators of time-shifted
observables experience the same decay rates as the corresponding Klein-Gordon
solutions, which depend in turn on the relative location of the observables'
support sets.

result covering is one of the main tasks of such networks. We study the problem
of maximizing the coverage lifetime of a barrier by mobile sensors with limited
battery powers, where the coverage lifetime is the time until there is a
breakdown in coverage due to the death of a sensor. Sensors are first deployed
and then coverage commences. Energy is consumed in proportion to the distance
traveled for mobility, while for coverage, energy is consumed in direct
proportion to the radius of the sensor raised to a constant exponent. We study
two variants which are distinguished by whether the sensing radii are given as
part of the input or can be optimized, the fixed radii problem and the variable
radii problem. We design parametric search algorithms for both problems for the
case where the final order of the sensors is predetermined and for the case
where sensors are initially located at barrier endpoints. In contrast, we show
that the variable radii problem is strongly NP-hard and provide hardness of
approximation results for fixed radii for the case where all the sensors are
initially co-located at an internal point of the barrier.

with respect to rotations of the oxygen octahedra. It is shown that the
ground-state structure of the crystal is $I4/mcm$. In order to find the

An enhanced value of the Debye-Waller factor for the Ba-O atomic pair

a possible structural glass formation in BaZrO$_3$ when lowering temperature,

a point source imaged by a pixel array detector in the presence of a
background, as a function of the detector properties. For this we use a
well-known result from parametric estimation theory, the so-called Cramer-Rao
lower bound. We develop the expressions in the 1-dimensional case of a linear
array detector in which the only unknown parameter is the source position. If
the object is oversampled by the detector, analytical expressions can be
obtained for the Cramer-Rao limit that can be readily used to estimate the
limiting precision of an imaging system, and which are very useful for
experimental (detector) design, observational planning, or performance
estimation of data analysis software: In particular, we demonstrate that for
background-dominated sources, the maximum astrometric precision goes as
$B/F^2$, where $B$ is the background in one pixel, and $F$ is the total flux of
the source, while when the background is negligible, this precision goes as
$F^{-1}$. We also explore the dependency of the astrometric precision on: (1)
the size of the source (as imaged by the detector), (2) the pixel detector
size, and (3) the effect of source de-centering. Putting these results into
context, the theoretical Cramer-Rao lower bound is compared to both ground- as
well as spaced-based astrometric results, indicating that current techniques
approach this limit very closely. Our results indicate that we have found in
the Cramer-Rao lower variance bound a very powerful astrometric ""benchmark""
estimator concerning the maximum expected positional precision for a point
source, given a prescription for the source, the background, the detector
characteristics, and the detection process.

examine the current status and future prospects of the VERITAS indirect dark
matter detection program. The VERITAS array of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov
telescopes (IACTs), sensitive in the 0.1-50 TeV regime, is in the process of
completing a multi-year program aimed at detecting signatures of neutralino
dark matter. This program is spread out over a range of astrophysical targets
which can potentially yield definitive signatures of neutralino
self-annihilation such as dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) and the center of
the Milky Way galaxy. While the program is still in progress, initial results
on dSphs have produced very competitive upper limits on the thermally averaged
cross-section of neutralino self-annihilation as well as strongly constraining
leptophillic dark matter models (such as those inferred from the PAMELA and AMS
positron fraction results). As the program continues over the next 5 years,
VERITAS observations will yield some of the strongest constraints available
from IACTs, pushing down the limit on the thermally averaged cross-section of
neutralino self-annihilation to the expected natural thermal relic scale.

core-collapse supernova and reveal the complicated inner workings of the
explosion we need a thorough understanding of the neutrino flavor evolution
from the proto-neutron star outwards. The flavor content of the signal evolves
due to both neutrino collective effects and matter effects which can lead to a
highly interesting interplay and distinctive spectral features. In this paper
we investigate the supernova neutrino flavor evolution in three different
progenitors and include collective flavor effects, the evolution of the
Mikheyev, Smirnov & Wolfenstein conversion due to the shock wave passage
through the star, and the impact of turbulence. In the Oxygen-Neon-Magnesium
supernova we find that the impact of turbulence is both brief and slight during
a window of 1-2 seconds post bounce. Thus the spectral features of collective
and shock effects in the neutrino signals from ONeMg supernovae may be almost
turbulence free making them the easiest to interpret. For the more massive
progenitors we again find that small amplitude turbulence, up to 10%, leads to
a minimal modification of the signal, and the emerging neutrino spectra retain
both collective and MSW features. However, when larger amounts of turbulence is
added, 30% and 50%, the features of collective and shock wave effects in the
high density resonance channel are almost completely obscured at late times.
Yet at the same time we find the other mixing channels - the low density
resonance channel and the non-resonant channels - begin to develop turbulence
signatures. Large amplitude turbulent motions in the outer layers of more
massive, iron core-collapse supernovae may obscure the most obvious
fingerprints of collective and shock wave effects in the neutrino signal but
cannot remove them completely, and additionally bring about new features in the
signal.

considers the evolution of these three subpopulations. Our main result is that,
in presence of a sufficiently stable environmental feature, as in the case of
an unchanging aspect of a physical habitat, specialists can dominate the
population. By contrast, rapidly changing environmental features, such as
language or cultural habits, are a moving target for the genes; here,
generalists dominate, because the best evolutionary strategy is to adopt
neutral alleles not specialized for any specific environment. The model we
propose is based on simple assumptions about evolutionary dynamics and
describes all possible scenarios in a non-trivial phase diagram. The approach
provides a general framework to address such fundamental issues as the Baldwin
effect, the biological basis for language, or the ecological consequences of a
rapid climate change.

remind `Partial Elimination Ideals (PEIs)' theory and introduce a new framework
in which one can study the syzygies of embedded projective schemes well using
PEIs theory and the reduction method via inner projections.
  Next we establish fundamental inequalities which govern the relations between
the graded Betti numbers in the first linear strand of an algebraic set $X$ and
those of its inner projection $X_q$. Using these results, we obtain some
natural sharp upper bounds for higher linear syzygies of any nondegenerate
projective variety in terms of the codimension with respect to its own
embedding and classify what the extremal case and next-to-extremal case are.
This is a generalization of Castelnuovo and Fano's results on the number of
quadrics containing a given variety and another characterization of varieties
of minimal degree and del Pezzo varieties from the viewpoint of `syzygies'.
Note that our method could be also applied to get similar results for more
general categories (e.g. connected in codimension one algebraic sets).

LX,Total - LB relation, we found a tight correlation between these physically
motivated quantities with a rms deviation of a factor of 3 in LX,Gas = 1038 -
1043 erg s-1 or MTotal = a few x 1010 - a few x 1012 Mo. More striking, this
relation becomes even tighter with a rms deviation of a factor of 1.3 among the
gas-rich galaxies (with LX,Gas > 1040 erg s-1). In a simple power-law form, the
new relation is (LX,Gas / 1040 erg s-1) = (MTotal / 3.2 x 1011 Mo)3. This
relation is also consistent with the steep relation between the gas luminosity
and temperature, LX,Gas ~ TGas4.5, identified by Boroson, Kim & Fabbiano
(2011), if the gas is virialized. Our results indicate that the total mass of
an ETG is the primary factor in regulating the amount of hot gas. Among the
gas-poor galaxies (with LX,Gas < a few x 1039 erg s-1), the scatter in the
LX,Gas - MTotal (and LX,Gas - TGas) relation increases, suggesting that

classical electrostatic theory of charged liquids composed of solvent molecules
modeled as finite size dipoles, and embedding polarizable ions that consist of
Drude oscillators. In qualitative agreement with ab-initio calculations of
polar solvents and ionic liquids, the hydration energy of a polarizable ion in
both type of dielectric liquid is shown to favor the expansion of its
electronic cloud. Namely, the ion carrying no dipole moment in the gas phase
acquires a dipole moment in the liquid environment, but its electron cloud also
reaches an enhanced rigidity. We find that the overall effect is an increase of
the gas phase polarizability upon hydration. In the specific case of ionic
liquids, it is shown that this hydration process is driven by a collective
solvation mechanism where the dipole moment of a polarizable ion induced by its
interaction with surrounding ions self-consistently adds to the polarization of
the liquid, thereby amplifying the dielectric permittivity of the medium in a
substantial way. We propose this self-consistent hydration as the underlying
mechanism behind the high dielectric permittivities of ionic liquids composed
of small charges with negligible gas phase dipole moment. Hydration being a
correlation effect, the emerging picture indicates that electrostatic
correlations cannot be neglected in polarizable liquids.

dataset used corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.7 fb-1 of

decays and the third to additional HF production. The dominant background to
ttbar+HF in this sample is ttbar+jet events in which a light-flavor jet is
misidentified as a heavy-flavor jet. To determine the heavy- and light-flavor
content of the additional b-tagged jets, a fit to the vertex mass distribution
of b-tagged jets in the sample is performed. The result of the fit shows that
79 +/- 14 (stat.) +/- 22 (syst.) of the 105 selected extra b-tagged jets
originate from HF quarks, three standard deviations away from the hypothesis of
zero ttbar+HF production. The result for extra HF production is quoted as a
ratio (R_HF) of the cross section for ttbar+HF production to the cross section
for ttbar production with at least one additional jet. Both cross sections are
measured in a fiducial kinematic region within the ATLAS acceptance. R_HF is

has been a long-standing issue that remains unresolved in many classes of
unconventional superconductors, notably cuprates, heavy fermion compounds and
most recently iron-pnictides. The existence of a QCP may offer a route to
understand: the origin of their anomalous non-Fermi liquid properties, the
microscopic coexistence between unconventional superconductivity and magnetic
or some exotic order, and ultimately the mechanism of superconductivity itself.
The isovalent substituted iron-pnictide BaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$ offers a
new platform for the study of quantum criticality, providing a unique
opportunity to study the evolution of the electronic properties in a wide range
of the phase diagram. Recent experiments in BaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$ have
provided the first clear and unambiguous evidence of a second order quantum
phase transition lying beneath the superconducting dome.

different sampling methods and give effective triangle counting methods. In

that are less transparent and general. Hence, given a specific disease model,
it is crucial to assess which representations of the raw data strike the best
balance between simplicity and detail. We consider high-resolution data on the
face-to-face interactions of individuals in a hospital ward, obtained by using
wearable proximity sensors. We simulate the spread of a disease in this

representations of the contact patterns. We show that a contact matrix that
only contains average contact durations fails to reproduce the size of the

the most at-risk classes. We introduce a contact matrix of probability
distributions that takes into account the heterogeneity of contact durations
between (and within) classes of individuals, and we show that this

that falls back onto the SMBH and powers a luminous flare. In this paper, we
perform hydrodynamical simulations of the disruption of a main-sequence star by
a SMBH to characterize the evolution of the debris stream after a tidal
disruption. We demonstrate that this debris stream is confined by self-gravity
in the two directions perpendicular to the original direction of the star's
travel, and as a consequence has a negligible surface area and makes almost no
contribution to either the continuum or line emission. We therefore propose
that any observed emission lines are not the result of photoionization in this
unbound debris, but are produced in the region above and below the forming
elliptical accretion disk, analogous to the broad-line region (BLR) in
steadily-accreting active galactic nuclei. As each line within a BLR is
observationally linked to a particular location in the accretion disk, we
suggest that the absence of a line indicates that the accretion disk does not
yet extend to the distance required to produce that line. This model can be
used to understand the spectral properties of the tidal disruption event (TDE)

foreseeable future. It is nonetheless possible to infer aspects of their
brightness markings and viewing geometries by analyzing disk-integrated
rotational and orbital brightness variations. We compute the harmonic
lightcurves, F_l^m(t), resulting from spherical harmonic maps of intensity or
albedo, Y_l^m(theta,phi), where l and m are the total and longitudinal order.
Notably, odd m>1 are present in an inclined lightcurve, but not seen by an
equatorial observer. We therefore suggest that the Fourier spectrum of a
thermal lightcurve may be sufficient to determine the orbital inclination of
non-transiting short-period planets, the rotational inclination of stars and
brown dwarfs, and the obliquity of directly imaged planets. In the best-case
scenario of a nearly edge-on geometry, measuring the m=3 mode of a star's
rotational lightcurve to within a factor of two provides an inclination
estimate good to +/- 6 degrees, assuming stars have randomly distributed spots.
Alternatively, if stars have brightness maps perfectly symmetric about the
equator, their lightcurves will have no m=3 power, regardless of orientation.
In general, inclination estimates will remain qualitative until detailed
hydrodynamic simulations and/or occultation maps can be used as a calibrator.
We further derive harmonic reflected lightcurves for tidally-locked planets;
these are higher-order versions of the well-known Lambert phase curve. We show
that a non-uniform planet may have an apparent albedo 25% lower than its
intrinsic albedo, even if it exhibits precisely Lambertian phase variations.
Lastly, we provide low-order analytic expressions for harmonic lightcurves that
can be used for fitting observed photometry; as a general rule, edge-on
solutions cannot simply be scaled by sin(i) to mimic inclined lightcurves.

indicating a high energy cut-off of the PLN and a low energy cut-off of the BLN

emission from this galaxy exhibits a P-Cygni profile, extends further than both
the continuum and [O II] emission along the eastern side of the slit, and has a
constant Doppler shift along the slit which does not follow the velocity
gradient of the nebular [O II] emission. Using the Sobolev approximation, we
derive the density of Mg+ ions at a radius of 12 to 18 kpc in the outflow. We
model the ionization correction and find that much of the outflowing Mg is in

masses per year, with the largest uncertainties coming from the depletion of Mg
onto grains and the clumpiness of the warm outflow. We show that confining the
warm clouds with a hot wind reduces the estimated mass flux of the warm outflow

the high blue luminosities that distinguish 32016857 and TKRS 4389, described

that, as sensitivity to diffuse emission improves, scattering halos may prove

superconductivity emerges from the pseudogap, the superconducting response is
found to be diminished in amplitude, broadened and, in the case of the

agreement with data on high temperature copper-oxide superconductors indicating
that the Hubbard model contains the essential low energy physics of the
pseudogap and its interplay with superconductivity in the cuprates.

combinations of low-energy physics parameters. Here we consider the probability
distribution over \zeta in the landscape. We argue that the Why Comparable
problem can be solved without detailed anthropic assumptions, and independently
of the nature of dark matter. Overproduction of dark matter suppresses the
probability like 1/(1+\zeta), if the causal patch is used to regulate
infinities. This suppression can counteract a prior distribution favoring large
\zeta, selecting \zeta ~ O(1).
  This effect not only explains the Why Comparable coincidence but also renders
otherwise implausible models of dark matter viable. For the special case of
axion dark matter, Wilczek and independently Freivogel have already noted that
a 1/(1+\zeta) suppression prevents overproduction of a GUT-scale QCD axion. If
the dark matter is the LSP, the effect can explain the moderate fine-tuning of
the weak scale in simple supersymmetric models.

distribution of initial density fluctuations generated by inflation. While the
simplest models predict an almost perfectly Gaussian distribution, more-general
models predict a level of primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) that observations
might yet be sensitive enough to detect. Recent Planck Collaboration
measurements of the CMB temperature anisotropy bispectrum significantly tighten
the observational limits, but they are still far from the PNG level predicted
by the simplest models of inflation. Probing levels below CMB sensitivities
will require other methods, such as searching for the statistical imprint of
PNG on galactic halo clustering. During the epoch of reionization (EoR), the
first stars and galaxies released radiation into the intergalactic medium (IGM)
that created ionized patches whose large-scale geometry and evolution reflected
the underlying abundance and large-scale clustering of the star-forming
galaxies. This statistical connection between ionized patches in the IGM and
galactic halos suggests that observing reionization may be another way to
constrain PNG. We employ the linear perturbation theory of reionization and
semi-analytic models based on the excursion-set formalism to model the effects
of PNG on the EoR. We quantify the effects of PNG on the large-scale structure
of reionization by deriving the ionized density bias, i.e. ratio of ionized
atomic to total matter overdensities in Fourier space, at small wavenumber.
Just as previous studies found that PNG creates a scale-dependent signature in
the halo bias, so, too, we find a scale-dependent signature in the ionized
density bias. Our results, which differ significantly from previous attempts in
the literature to characterize this PNG signature, will be applied elsewhere to
predict its observable consequences, e.g. in the cosmic 21cm background.

large number of candidates that must be analysed. One of these new pulsars has
a dispersion measure of 273 pc cm$^{-3}$, almost twice the highest previously
known value, making it possibly the most distant LMC pulsar. In addition, we
present the null result of a radio pulse search of an X-ray point source
located in SNR J0047.2$-$7308 in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Although no
millisecond pulsars have been found, these discoveries have increased the known
rotation powered pulsar population in the LMC by more than 50%. Using the
current sample of LMC pulsars, we used a Bayesian analysis to constrain the
number of potentially observable pulsars in the LMC to within a 95% credible
interval of 57000$^{+70000}_{-30000}$. The new survey at Parkes is $\sim$20%
complete and it is expected to yield at most six millisecond pulsars in the LMC

provides only a marginal increase in sensitivity to long periods. The limiting
luminosity for this survey is 125 mJy kpc$^2$ for the LMC which covers the
upper 10% of all known radio pulsars. The luminosity function for normal
pulsars in the LMC is consistent with their counterparts in the Galactic disk.
The maximum 1400 MHz radio luminosity for LMC pulsars is $\sim 1000$ mJy
kpc$^2$.

due to the combination of small rates, difficult multi-jet final states and
overwhelming backgrounds. In the Standard Model the largest number of events is
expected when h->bb, giving rise to a WWbbbb signature, deluged in tt+jets. A
promising strategy to improve the sensitivity is to maximally exploit the

matrix element method. We show how, despite the complexity of the final state,
the method can be efficiently applied to discriminate the signal against
combinatorial and tt+jets backgrounds. Remarkably, we find that a moderate

Given a dynamical assumption on the expectation value of particle number
density, we prove that small subsystems reach equilibrium at the level of
quantum wave-function, and with respect to all observables. The picture that
emerges is that at higher energies, larger subsystems can reach equilibrium.
For bosonic fields on a lattice, in the limit of large number of bosons per
site, all subsystem smaller than half equilibrate. In the Hermitian matrix
model, by contrast, this occurs in the limit of large energy per matrix
element, emphasizing the importance of the $O(N^2)$ energy scale for the fast
scrambling conjecture. Applying our techniques to continuum field theories on
compact spaces, we show that the density matrix of small momentum-space

this model is a maximal subgraph whose minimum degree is $\geq k$. However the
dropping out of individuals with degrees less than $k$ might lead to a
cascading effect of iterated withdrawals such that the size of equilibrium
subgraph becomes very small. To overcome this some special vertices called
""anchors"" are introduced: these vertices need not have large degree. Bhawalkar

two southern arms of the X both crossing the lines of sight at l=0 and |b|>4,
hence producing a double red clump (RC) in the bulge CMD. Dynamical models
predict the formation of X-shaped bulges, as extreme cases of boxy-peanut
bulges. However, since X-shaped bulges were known to be present only in
external galaxies, models have never been compared to 3D kinematical data for
individual stars. We study the orbital motion of Galactic bulge stars, in the
two arms of the X in the southern hemisphere. The goal is to provide
observational constraints to bulge formation models that predict the formation
of X-shapes through bar dynamical instabilities. Radial velocities have been
obtained for a sample of 454 bulge giants, roughly equally distributed between
the bright and faint RC, in a field at (l,b)=(0,-6). Proper motions were
derived for all RC stars in the same field by combining images from two epochs
obtained 11 years apart. The proper motions for the spectroscopic subsample are
analyzed taking into account the radial velocities and metallicities measured
from near-IR Calcium triplet lines, for a subsample of 352 stars. The radial
velocity distribution of stars in the bright RC, tracing the closer overdensity
of bulge stars, shows an excess of stars moving towards the Sun. Similarly, an
excess of stars receding from the Sun is seen in the far overdensity, traced by
faint RC stars. This is explained with the presence of stars on elongated
orbits, most likely streaming along the arms of the X-shaped bulge. Proper
motions for these stars are consistent with qualitative predictions of
dynamical models of peanut-shaped bulges. Surprisingly, stars on elongated
orbits have preferentially metal poor metallicities, while the metal rich ones,
in both overdensities, are preferentially found in more axysimmetric orbits.

Assuming planar geometry, local Compton equilibrium and bremsstrahlung emission
as the dominant photon production mechanism, numerical solutions are obtained
for the photon number density and temperature profiles as a function of time,
for hydrogen-helium envelopes. The temperature solutions are determined by the
breakout shock velocity $v_0$ and the pre-shock breakout density $\rho_0$, and
depend weakly on the value of n. Fitting formulas for the peak surface
temperature at breakout as a function of $v_0$ and $\rho_0$ are provided, with
$T_{peak}\approx 9.44\exp{[12.63(v_0/c)^{1/2}]}$ eV, and the time dependence of
the surface temperature is tabulated. The time integrated emitted spectrum is a
robust prediction of the model, determined by $\mathcal{T}_{\rm peak}$ and
$v_0$ alone and insensitive to details of light travel time or slight
deviations from spherical symmetry. Adopting commonly assumed progenitor
parameters, breakout luminosities of ~10^45 erg/s and ~10^44 erg/s in the
0.3-10 keV band are expected for BSG and RSG/He-WR progenitors respectively
(T_{peak} is well below the band for RSGs, unless their radius is ~10^13 cm).
>30 detections of SN1987A-like (BSG) breakouts are expected over the lifetime
of ROSAT and XMM-Newton. An absence of such detections would imply that either
the typical parameters assumed for BSG progenitors are grossly incorrect or
that their envelopes are not hydrostatic. The observed spectrum and duration of

accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars is controlled by the magnetic field of the

field is not well-understood, particularly at low accretion rates (the
so-called ``propeller regime'). This is due in part to the lack of clear
observational diagnostics to constrain the physics of the disk-field
interaction. Here we associate the strong ~1 Hz modulation seen in the
accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar NGC 6440 X-2 with an instability that arises
when the inner edge of the accretion disk is close to the corotation radius
(where the stellar rotation rate matches the Keplerian speed in the disk). A
similar modulation has previously been observed in another accreting
millisecond X-ray pulsar (SAX J1808.4-3658) and we suggest that the two
phenomena are related and that this may be a common phenomenon among other
magnetized systems. Detailed comparisons with theoretical models suggest that
when the instability is observed, the interaction region between the disk and
the field is very narrow -- of the order of 1 km. Modelling further suggests
that there is a transition region (~1-10 km) around the corotation radius where
the disk-field torque changes sign from spin up to spin down. This is the first
time that a direct observational constraint has been placed on the width of the
disk-magnetosphere interaction region, in the frame of the trapped-disk

Their light curves were parametrised by the SALT2 model and the significance of
the observed differences was assessed by a resampling technique. To test our
samples and methods, we first looked for known differences between SNe Ia
residing in active and passive galaxies. We confirm that passive galaxies host
SNe Ia with smaller stretch, weaker colour-luminosity relation [$\beta$ of
2.54(22) against 3.35(14)], and that are $\sim$ 0.1 mag more luminous after
stretch and colour corrections. We show that only 0.02 per cent of random
samples drawn from our set of SNe Ia in active galaxies can reach these values.
Reported differences in the Hubble residuals scatter could not be detected,
possibly due to the exclusion of outliers. We then show that, while most field
and cluster SNe Ia properties are compatible at the current level, their
stretch distributions are different ($\sim3\sigma$): besides having a higher
concentration of passive galaxies than the field, the cluster's passive
galaxies host SNe Ia with an average stretch even smaller than those in field
passive galaxies (at 95 per cent confidence). We argue that the older age of
passive galaxies in clusters is responsible for this effect since, as we show,
old passive galaxies host SNe Ia with smaller stretch than young passive
galaxies ($\sim4\sigma$).

The motion of an element a in A is the number of points of X that are moved by
a, and the motion of the group A is the minimal motion of its nonidentity
elements. For finite A, the Motion Lemma says that if the motion of A is large
enough (specifically at least 2 log_2 |A|), then the action is
2-distinguishable. For many situations where X has a combinatorial or algebraic
structure, the Motion Lemma implies the action of Aut(X) on X is
2-distinguishable in all but finitely many instances.
  We prove an infinitary version of the Motion Lemma for countably infinite
permutation groups, which states that infinite motion is large enough to
guarantee 2-distinguishability. From this we deduce a number of results,
including the fact that every locally finite, connected graph whose
automorphism group is countably infinite is 2-distinguishable. One cannot
extend the Motion Lemma to uncountable permutation groups, but nonetheless we
prove that 2-distinguishable permutation groups with infinite motion are dense
in the class of groups with infinite motion. We conjecture an extension of the
Motion Lemma which we expect holds for a restricted class of uncountable
permutation groups, and we conclude with a list of open questions. The

O-17(\alpha,\gamma)Ne-21 determines whether O-16 is an efficient neutron poison
for the s process in massive stars, or if most of the neutrons captured by
O-16(n,\gamma) are recycled into the stellar environment. This ratio is of
particular relevance to constrain the s process yields of fast rotating massive
stars at low metallicity. Recent results on the (\alpha,\gamma) channel have
made it necessary to measure the (\alpha,n) reaction more precisely and
investigate the effect of the new data on s process nucleosynthesis in massive
stars.
  We present a new measurement of the O-17(\alpha, n) reaction using a
moderating neutron detector. In addition, the (\alpha, n_1) channel has been
measured independently by observation of the characteristic 1633 keV
\gamma-transition in Ne-20. The reaction cross section was determined with a
simultaneous R-matrix fit to both channels. (\alpha,n) and (\alpha, \gamma)
resonance strengths of states lying below the covered energy range were
estimated using their known properties from the literature.
  A new O-17(\alpha,n) reaction rate was deduced for the temperature range 0.1
GK to 10 GK. It was found that in He burning conditions the (\alpha,\gamma)
channel is strong enough to compete with the neutron channel. This leads to a
less efficient neutron recycling compared to a previous suggestion of a very
weak (\alpha,\gamma) channel. S process calculations using our rates confirm
that massive rotating stars do play a significant role in the production of
elements up to Sr, but they strongly reduce the s process contribution to
heavier elements.

that obviates the need for explicit storage of the time history of particle
velocities. Capability is demonstrated with respect to accuracy in numerous

of this spin current is due to spin-triplet Cooper pairs (STCs) formed by
electrons of equal-spin, which are induced by proximity effect inside the F. We
find that the spin current carried by the STCs exhibits long-range propagation

of homotopy type which has the ability to distinguish weakly homotopy

  A space $X$ is $\pi_1$-shape injective if the fundamental group canonically

traffic. We focus on a usual type of interest-driven social sessions in OSNs,
called \emph{Social-InterestCast}, under which a user will autonomously
determine whether to view the content from his followees depending on his
interest. It is challenging to figure out the formation mechanism of such a
Social-InterestCast, since it involves multiple interrelated factors such as
users' social relationships, users' interests, and content semantics. We
propose a four-layered system model, consisting of physical layer, social
layer, content layer, and session layer. By this model we successfully obtain
the geographical distribution of Social-InterestCast sessions, serving as the
precondition for quantifying data transport difficulty. We define the
fundamental limit of \emph{transport load} as a new metric, called
\emph{transport complexity}, i.e., the \emph{minimum required} transport load
for an OSN over a given carrier network. Specifically, we derive the transport
complexity for Social-InterestCast sessions in a large-scale OSN over the
carrier network with optimal communication architecture. The results can act as
the common lower bounds on transport load for Social-InterestCast over any
carrier networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
measure the transport difficulty for data dissemination in OSNs by modeling
session patterns with the interest-driven characteristics.

extent to which the topological structure of a metabolic network determines its
dynamic behavior, irrespective of kinetic details. Here, we study a class of
metabolic networks known as non-autocatalytic metabolic cycles, and
analytically prove an open conjecture regarding the stability of their
steady-states. Importantly, our results are invariant to the choice of kinetic

Unexpectedly, our proof exposes an elementary but apparently open problem of
locating the roots of a sum of two polynomials S = P+Q, when the roots of the
summand polynomials P and Q are known. We derive two new results named the
Stubborn Roots Theorems, which provide sufficient conditions under which the

vortex melting transition, which occurs well below the onset of superconducting
correlations. Here we investigate the vortex phase diagram of the novel
Fe-based superconductor in form of a high-quality single crystal of
Ba0.5K0.5Fe2As2, using three different experimental probes (specific heat,
thermal expansion and magnetization). We find clear thermodynamic signatures of
a vortex melting transition, which shows that the thermal fluctuations in
applied magnetic fields also have a considerable impact on the superconducting
properties of iron-based superconductors.

highly important to explore the nature of their stability. The stability of
charged Reissner-Nordstr\""om black holes to {\it neutral} (gravitational and
electromagnetic) perturbations was established almost four decades ago.
However, the stability of these charged black holes under {\it charged}
perturbations has remained an open question due to the complexity introduced by
the well-known phenomena of superradiant scattering: A charged scalar field
impinging on a charged Reissner-Nordstr\""om black hole can be {\it amplified}
as it scatters off the hole. If the incident field has a non-zero rest mass,
then the mass term effectively works as a mirror, preventing the energy
extracted from the hole from escaping to infinity. One may suspect that the
superradiant amplification of charged fields by the charged black hole may lead
to an instability of the Reissner-Nordstr\""om spacetime (in as much the same
way that rotating Kerr black holes are unstable under rotating scalar
perturbations). However, in this Letter we show that, for charged
Reissner-Nordstr\""om black holes in the regime ${(Q/M)}^2\leq 8/9$, the two
conditions which are required in order to trigger a possible superradiant
instability [namely: (1) the existence of a trapping potential well outside the
black hole, and (2) superradiant amplification of the trapped modes] cannot be
satisfied simultaneously. Our results thus support the stability of charged
Reissner-Nordstr\""om black holes under charged scalar perturbations in the

  Through Randomization",,,,,"cs.DC cs.DS cs.NA math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Asynchronous methods for solving systems of linear equations have been
researched since Chazan and Miranker's pioneering 1969 paper on chaotic
relaxation. The underlying idea of asynchronous methods is to avoid processor
idle time by allowing the processors to continue to make progress even if not
all progress made by other processors has been communicated to them.
  Historically, the applicability of asynchronous methods for solving linear
equations was limited to certain restricted classes of matrices, such as
diagonally dominant matrices. Furthermore, analysis of these methods focused on
proving convergence in the limit. Comparison of the asynchronous convergence
rate with its synchronous counterpart and its scaling with the number of
processors were seldom studied, and are still not well understood.
  In this paper, we propose a randomized shared-memory asynchronous method for
general symmetric positive definite matrices. We rigorously analyze the
convergence rate and prove that it is linear, and is close to that of the
method's synchronous counterpart if the processor count is not excessive
relative to the size and sparsity of the matrix. We also present an algorithm
for unsymmetric systems and overdetermined least-squares. Our work presents a
significant improvement in the applicability of asynchronous linear solvers as
well as in their convergence analysis, and suggests randomization as a key
paradigm to serve as a foundation for asynchronous methods.

structure and function by finding homologous, or evolutionarily-related,
proteins of known structure and function. Since structure is typically more
conserved than sequence over long evolutionary distances, recognizing remote
protein homologs from their sequence poses a challenge.
  We first consider all proteins of known three-dimensional structure, and
explore how they cluster according to different levels of homology. An
automatic computational method reasonably approximates a human-curated
hierarchical organization of proteins according to their degree of homology.
  Next, we return to homology prediction, based only on the one-dimensional
amino acid sequence of a protein. Menke, Berger, and Cowen proposed a Markov
random field model to predict remote homology for beta-structural proteins, but
their formulation was computationally intractable on many beta-strand
topologies.
  We show two different approaches to approximate this random field, both of
which make it computationally tractable, for the first time, on all protein
folds. One method simplifies the random field itself, while the other retains
the full random field, but approximates the solution through stochastic search.
Both methods achieve improvements over the state of the art in remote homology
detection for beta-structural protein folds.

ranking functions. In this paper we study, from a theoretical perspective, the
widely used Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)-type ranking measures.
Although there are extensive empirical studies of NDCG, little is known about
its theoretical properties. We first show that, whatever the ranking function
is, the standard NDCG which adopts a logarithmic discount, converges to 1 as
the number of items to rank goes to infinity. On the first sight, this result
is very surprising. It seems to imply that NDCG cannot differentiate good and
bad ranking functions, contradicting to the empirical success of NDCG in many
applications. In order to have a deeper understanding of ranking measures in
general, we propose a notion referred to as consistent distinguishability. This
notion captures the intuition that a ranking measure should have such a
property: For every pair of substantially different ranking functions, the
ranking measure can decide which one is better in a consistent manner on almost
all datasets. We show that NDCG with logarithmic discount has consistent
distinguishability although it converges to the same limit for all ranking
functions. We next characterize the set of all feasible discount functions for
NDCG according to the concept of consistent distinguishability. Specifically we
show that whether NDCG has consistent distinguishability depends on how fast
the discount decays, and 1/r is a critical point. We then turn to the cut-off
version of NDCG, i.e., NDCG@k. We analyze the distinguishability of NDCG@k for
various choices of k and the discount functions. Experimental results on real
Web search datasets agree well with the theory.

weak functions and their weak derivatives defined as distributions. Weak
functions and weak derivatives can be approximated by polynomials with various
degrees. Different combination of polynomial spaces leads to different weak
Galerkin finite element methods, which makes WG methods highly flexible and
efficient in practical computation. This paper explores the possibility of
optimal combination of polynomial spaces that minimize the number of unknowns
in the numerical scheme, yet without compromising the accuracy of the numerical
approximation. For illustrative purpose, the authors use second order elliptic
problems to demonstrate the basic idea of polynomial reduction. A new weak
Galerkin finite element method is proposed and analyzed. This new finite
element scheme features piecewise polynomials of degree $k\ge 1$ on each
element plus piecewise polynomials of degree $k-1\ge 0$ on the edge or face of
each element. Error estimates of optimal order are established for the
corresponding WG approximations in both a discrete $H^1$ norm and the standard
$L^2$ norm. In addition, the paper presents a great deal of numerical
experiments to demonstrate the power of the WG method in dealing with finite
element partitions consisting of arbitrary polygons in two dimensional spaces

various finite element partitions such as triangular mesh, quadrilateral mesh,
honey comb mesh in 2d and mesh with deformed cubes in 3d. The numerical results

the relativistic energy levels of hydrogen atom induced by these
Lorentz-violating operators in the absence and presence of uniform external
fields in first-order perturbation theory. We find that the hydrogen spectrum

to complement and improve the communication security in future wireless
networks. The current research and development in physical layer security is
often based on the ideal assumption of perfect channel knowledge or the
capability of variable-rate transmissions. In this work, we study the secure
transmission design in more practical scenarios by considering channel
estimation errors at the receiver and investigating both fixed-rate and
variable-rate transmissions. Assuming quasi-static fading channels, we design
secure on-off transmission schemes to maximize the throughput subject to a
constraint on secrecy outage probability. For systems with given and fixed
encoding rates, we show how the optimal on-off transmission thresholds and the
achievable throughput vary with the amount of knowledge on the eavesdropper's
channel. In particular, our design covers the interesting case where the
eavesdropper also uses the pilots sent from the transmitter to obtain imperfect
channel estimation. An interesting observation is that using too much pilot
power can harm the throughput of secure transmission if both the legitimate
receiver and the eavesdropper have channel estimation errors, while the secure
transmission always benefits from increasing pilot power when only the
legitimate receiver has channel estimation errors but not the eavesdropper.
When the encoding rates are controllable parameters to design, we further
derive both a non-adaptive and an adaptive rate transmission schemes by jointly
optimizing the encoding rates and the on-off transmission thresholds to
maximize the throughput of secure transmissions.

learning and clustering. In a similarity graph, each vertex denotes a data
point and the edge weight represents the similarity between two points. There
are two popular schemes to construct a similarity graph, i.e., pairwise
distance based scheme and linear representation based scheme. Most existing
works have only involved one of the above schemes and suffered from some
limitations. Specifically, pairwise distance based methods are sensitive to the
noises and outliers compared with linear representation based methods. On the
other hand, there is the possibility that linear representation based
algorithms wrongly select inter-subspaces points to represent a point, which
will degrade the performance. In this paper, we propose an algorithm, called
Locally Linear Representation (LLR), which integrates pairwise distance with
linear representation together to address the problems. The proposed algorithm
can automatically encode each data point over a set of points that not only
could denote the objective point with less residual error, but also are close
to the point in Euclidean space. The experimental results show that our
approach is promising in subspace learning and subspace clustering.

federated clouds exploits temporal availability of resources and geographical
diversity of operational costs for efficient job service. While
interoperability issues across different cloud platforms in a cloud federation
have been extensively studied, fundamental questions on cloud economics remain:
When and how should a cloud trade resources (e.g., virtual machines) with
others, such that its net profit is maximized over the long run, while a
close-to-optimal social welfare in the entire federation can also be
guaranteed? To answer this question, a number of important, inter-related
decisions, including job scheduling, server provisioning and resource pricing,
should be dynamically and jointly made, while the long-term profit optimality
is pursued. In this work, we design efficient algorithms for inter-cloud
virtual machine (VM) trading and scheduling in a cloud federation. For VM
transactions among clouds, we design a double-auction based mechanism that is
strategyproof, individual rational, ex-post budget balanced, and efficient to
execute over time. Closely combined with the auction mechanism is a dynamic VM
trading and scheduling algorithm, which carefully decides the true valuations
of VMs in the auction, optimally schedules stochastic job arrivals with
different SLAs onto the VMs, and judiciously turns on and off servers based on
the current electricity prices. Through rigorous analysis, we show that each
individual cloud, by carrying out the dynamic algorithm in the online double
auction, can achieve a time-averaged profit arbitrarily close to the offline
optimum. Asymptotic optimality in social welfare is also achieved under
homogeneous cloud settings. We carry out trace-driven simulations to examine
the effectiveness of our algorithms and the achievable social welfare under
heterogeneous cloud settings.

sequences to users in a mobile ad hoc network that has no spatial boundary. A
basic tenet of the transmission sequence approach for addressing media access
control is that under normal operating conditions, there is no feedback
triggered re-transmission. This obviously is a major departure from the
Slotted-ALOHA or CSMA type approaches. While these solutions enjoy excellent
throughput performance, a fundamental drawback is that they are based on
feedback information. For systems without naturally defined central controller
that can play the role of a base station, the task of providing feedback
information could easily become unmanageable. This highlights the advantage of
the feedback-free approach. A second advantage is the ability to handle
unlimited spatial coverage. We propose in this paper a concept for media access
control that is akin to frequency reuse. However, instead of reusing frequency,
the new approach allows transmission sequences be reused. A study of the
transmission sequence approach against other approaches is conducted by
comparing the minimal frame lengths that can guarantee the existence of
conflict-free transmissions.

transition by focusing on the multifractal (MF) exponents $X_q$ describing the
scaling of the disorder-average moments of the point contact conductance $T$

Past analytical work has related the exponents $X_q$ to the MF exponents
$\Delta_q$ of the local density of states (LDOS). To verify this relation, we
numerically determine the exponents $X_q$ with high accuracy. We thereby
provide, at the same time, independent numerical results for the MF exponents
$\Delta_q$ for the LDOS. The presence of subleading corrections to scaling
makes such determination directly from scaling of the moments of $T$ virtually
impossible. We overcome this difficulty by using two recent advances. First, we
construct pure scaling operators for the moments of $T$ which have precisely
the same leading scaling behavior, but no subleading contributions. Secondly,
we take into account corrections to scaling from irrelevant (in the
renormalization group sense) scaling fields by employing a numerical technique
(""stability map"") recently developed by us. We thereby numerically confirm the
relation between the two sets of exponents, $X_q$ (point contact conductances)
and $\Delta_q$ (LDOS), and also determine the leading irrelevant (corrections
to scaling) exponent $y$ as well as other subleading exponents. Our results
suggest a way to access multifractality in an experimental setting.

that the star moves with high velocity (~ 100 km/s) through the ambient

laboratory plasmas and they are likely to exist in astrophysical plasmas. Their
maximum speed, expressed in units of the ion acoustic speed far upstream of the
shock, depends only on the electron-to-ion temperature ratio if binary
collisions are absent. The formation and evolution of such shocks is examined
here for a wide range of shock speeds with particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations.
The initial temperatures of the electrons and the 400 times heavier ions are
equal. Shocks form on electron time scales at Mach numbers between 1.7 and 2.2.
Shocks with Mach numbers up to 2.5 form after tens of inverse ion plasma
frequencies. The density of the shock-reflected ion beam increases and the
number of ions crossing the shock thus decreases with an increasing Mach
number, causing a slower expansion of the downstream region in its rest frame.
The interval occupied by this ion beam is on a positive potential relative to
the far upstream. This potential pre-heats the electrons ahead of the shock
even in the absence of beam instabilities and decouples the electron
temperature in the foreshock ahead of the shock from the one in the far
upstream plasma. The effective Mach number of the shock is reduced by this
electron heating. This effect can potentially stabilize nonrelativistic
electrostatic shocks moving as fast as supernova remnant (SNR) shocks.

downscaling of the reanalyzed data.

conductance through the SWCNT is modulated by sweeping the magnetic field,
exhibiting magnetoresistance ratios up to 300% between fully polarized and

Unlike canonical radio pulsars, X-ray pulsars are not subject to physical
limits to the emission mechanism nor observational biases against the detection
of sources with longer periods. Here we show that a highly resistive layer in
the innermost part of the crust of neutron stars naturally limits the spin
period to a maximum value of about 10-20 s. This highly resistive layer is
expected if the inner crust is amorphous and heterogeneous in nuclear charge,
possibly due to the existence of a nuclear pasta phase. Our findings suggest
that the maximum period of isolated X-ray pulsars can be the first
observational evidence of an amorphous inner crust, which properties can be
further constrained by future X-ray timing missions combined with more detailed
models.

Ginzburg temperature for the Coulomb-dominated models of ionic fluids. We
consider the charge-asymmetric primitive model supplemented by short-range
attractive interactions in the vicinity of the gas-liquid critical point. For
this model, we derive the effective Ising-like $\phi^{4}$-model Hamiltonian
expressed in terms of the collective variables describing the fluctuation modes
of the total number density. We obtain the explicit expressions for all the
Hamiltonian coefficients within the framework of the same approximation,
namely, the one-loop approximation which produces the mean-field critical
parameters. Based on this Hamiltonian, we consistently calculate the reduced
Ginzburg temperature $t_{G}$ for both the pure Coulombic model (a restricted
primitive model) and the pure solvophobic model (a hard-sphere square-well
model) as well as for the model parameters ranging between these two limiting
cases. Contrary to the previous theoretical estimates, we obtain the reduced
Ginzburg temperature for the pure Coulombic model to be about 20 times smaller
than for the pure solvophobic model. For the full model including the
short-range attractive and long-range Coulomb interactions, we show that
$t_{G}$ approaches the value found for the pure Coulombic model when the
strength of the Coulomb interactions becomes large enough. Our results suggest
a key role of the Coulomb interactions in the crossover behaviour observed
experimentally in ionic fluids as well as confirm the Ising-like criticality in
the Coulomb-dominated ionic systems.

DMRD-SU admitted the existence of positive arrival-caused utility. In addition,
besides the travel-time-caused utility and arrival-caused utility, DMRD-SU
firstly took the departure utility into account. The necessity of the departure
utility in trip scheduling was analysed comprehensively, and the corresponding
individual trip scheduling model was presented. Based on a simple network, an
analytical example was executed to characterize DMRD-SU. It can be found from
the analytical example that: 1) DMRD-SU can predict the accumulation departure
behaviors at NDT, which explains the formation of daily serious
short-peak-hours in reality, while MRD-SU cannot; 2) compared with MRD-SU,
DMRD-SU predicts that people tend to depart later and its gross utility also
decrease faster. Therefore, the departure utility should be considered to
describe the traveler's scheduling behaviors better.

to include the bending rigidity k and Gaussian rigidity k_bar in its
description. New formulas for k and k_bar in the context of density functional
theory with a non-local, integral expression for the interaction between
molecules are presented. These expressions are used to investigate the
influence of the choice of Gibbs dividing surface and it is shown that for a
one-component system, the equimolar surface has a special status in the sense
that both k and k_bar are then the least sensitive to a change in the location
of the dividing surface. Furthermore, the equimolar value for k corresponds to
its maximum value and the equimolar value for k_bar corresponds to its minimum
value. An explicit evaluation using a short-ranged interaction potential
between molecules, shows that k is negative with a value around minus 0.5-1.0
kT and that k_bar is positive with a value which is a bit more than half the
magnitude of k. Finally, for dispersion forces between molecules, we show that
a term proportional to log(R)/R^2 replaces the rigidity constants and we
determine the (universal) proportionality constants.

transition occurring in the uRHIC's and a first constraint on the temperature

across a population of genetically identical cells. Such fluctuations can lead
to phenotypic variation in clonal populations, hence there is considerable
interest in quantifying noise in gene expression using stochastic models.
However, obtaining exact analytical results for protein distributions has been
an intractable task for all but the simplest models. Here, we invoke the
partitioning property of Poisson processes to develop a mapping that
significantly simplifies the analysis of stochastic models of gene expression.
The mapping leads to exact protein distributions using results for mRNA
distributions in models with promoter-based regulation. Using this approach, we
derive exact analytical results for steady-state and time-dependent
distributions for the basic 2-stage model of gene expression. Furthermore, we
show how the mapping leads to exact protein distributions for extensions of the
basic model that include the effects of post-transcriptional and
post-translational regulation. The approach developed in this work is widely
applicable and can contribute to a quantitative understanding of stochasticity
in gene expression and its regulation.

a particular non-commutative semigroup (of matrices) as the platform and show
that security of the relevant protocol is based on a quite different assumption

winds and low sand availability --- commonly display an asymmetric shape, with
one limb extended downwind. Several factors have been identified as potential
causes for barchan dune asymmetry on Earth and Mars: asymmetric bimodal wind
regime, topography, influx asymmetry and dune collision. However, the dynamics
and potential range of barchan morphologies emerging under each specific
scenario that leads to dune asymmetry are far from being understood. In the
present work, we use dune modeling in order to investigate the formation and
evolution of asymmetric barchans. We find that a bimodal wind regime causes
limb extension when the divergence angle between primary and secondary winds is
larger than $90^{\circ}$, whereas the extended limb evolves into a seif dune if
the ratio between secondary and primary transport rates is larger than 25%.
Calculations of dune formation on an inclined surface under constant wind
direction also lead to barchan asymmetry, however no seif dune is obtained from
surface tilting alone. Asymmetric barchans migrating along a tilted surface
move laterally, with transverse migration velocity proportional to the slope of
the terrain. Limb elongation induced by topography can occur when a barchan
crosses a topographic rise. Furthermore, transient asymmetric barchan shapes
with extended limb also emerge during collisions between dunes or due to an
asymmetric influx. Our findings can be useful for making quantitative inference
on local wind regimes or spatial heterogeneities in transport conditions of
planetary dune fields hosting asymmetric barchans.

weaknesses, will likely remain in use in the foreseeable future.
Human-generated passwords typically have a rich structure, which makes them
susceptible to guessing attacks. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of
guessing attacks based on Markov models. Our contributions are two-fold. First,
we propose a novel password cracker based on Markov models, which builds upon
and extends ideas used by Narayanan and Shmatikov (CCS 2005). In extensive
experiments we show that it can crack up to 69% of passwords at 10 billion
guesses, more than all probabilistic password crackers we compared again t.
Second, we systematically analyze the idea that additional personal information
about a user helps in speeding up password guessing. We find that, on average
and by carefully choosing parameters, we can guess up to 5% more passwords,
especially when the number of attempts is low. Furthermore, we show that the
gain can go up to 30% for passwords that are actually based on personal
attributes. These passwords are clearly weaker and should be avoided. Our
cracker could be used by an organization to detect and reject them. To the best
of our knowledge, we are the first to systematically study the relationship
between chosen passwords and users' personal information. We test and validate
our results over a wide collection of leaked password databases.

power-law, exponential and polynomial forms of $f(T)$ theories. All forms of
$f(T)$ concerned in this work possess the time translational symmetry, which is
related with energy condition or Hamilton constraint. In addition, we find out
that the performances of the power-law and exponential forms are not pleasing.
It is rational adding a linear term $T$ to $T^n$ as the most efficient
amendment to resemble the teleparallel gravity or General Relativity on small
scales, ie., the scale of the solar system. The corresponding Noether symmetry
indicates that only time translational symmetry remains. Through numerically
calculations and observational data-sets constraining, the optimal form $\alpha
T + \beta T^{-1}$ is obtained, whose cosmological solution resembles the
standard $\Lambda$CDM best with lightly reduced cosmic age which can be
alleviated by introducing another $T^m$ term. More important is that we find
the significant differences between $\Lambda$CDM and $f(T)$ gravity. The
$\Lambda$CDM model has also two additional symmetries and corresponding
positive conserved quantities, except the two negative conserved quantities.

a honeycomb lattice. The low-energy electronic excitations in this 2D crystal
are described by massless Dirac fermions that have a linear dispersion relation
similar to photons. Taking advantage of this optics-like electron dynamics,
generic optical elements like lenses, beam splitters and wave guides have been
proposed for electrons in engineered ballistic graphene. Tuning of these
elements relies on the ability to adjust the carrier concentration in defined

electrostatic gating remains challenging. Here, we report on the fabrication

regularization (0<p<1). Two formulations are considered: (i) an Lp-constrained
optimization and (ii) an Lp-penalized (unconstrained) optimization. Due to the
nonconvexity of the Lp quasi-norm, the solution paths of the regularized least
squares problem are not ensured to be continuous. A critical path, which is a
maximal continuous curve consisting of critical points, is therefore considered
separately. The critical paths are piecewise smooth, as can be seen from the
viewpoint of the variational method, and generally contain non-optimal points
such as saddle points and local maxima as well as global/local minima. Along
each critical path, the correspondence between the regularization parameters
(which govern the 'strength' of regularization in the two formulations) is
non-monotonic and, more specifically, it has multiplicity. Two paths of
critical points connecting the origin and an ordinary least squares (OLS)
solution are highlighted. One is a main path starting at an OLS solution, and
the other is a greedy path starting at the origin. Part of the greedy path can
be constructed with a generalized Minkowskian gradient. The breakpoints of the
greedy path coincide with the step-by-step solutions generated by using
orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), thereby establishing a direct link between
OMP and Lp-regularized least squares.

regular black holes can be destroyed. If we believe that the central

we might have a chance to see the black hole's internal region and observe
quantum gravity phenomena. As our finding implies the violation of the black

it consists of 18 terms: the unpolarised cross section, the beam asymmetry, 4
target asymmetries and 12 asymmetries in which both beam and target are
polarised. They are expressed by the helicity amplitudes and -- where available
-- related to observables discussed by other authors. As application to
deuteron Compton scattering, their dependence on the (isoscalar) scalar and
spin dipole polarisabilities of the nucleon is explored in Chiral Effective
Field Theory with dynamical Delta(1232) degrees of freedom at order
$e^2\delta^3$. Some asymmetries are sensitive to only one or two dipole
polarisabilities, making them particularly attractive for experimental studies.
At a photon energy of 100 MeV, a set of 5 observables is identified from which
one may be able to extract the spin polarisabilities of the nucleon. These are
experimentally realistic but challenging and mostly involve tensor-polarised
deuterons. Relative to Compton scattering from a nucleon, sensitivity to the
""mixed"" spin polarisabilities $\gamma_{E1M2}$ and $\gamma_{M1E2}$ is increased
because of interference with the D wave component of the deuteron and with its
pion-exchange current. An interactive Mathematica 9.0 notebook with results for

steady conduction to a flow-through porous electrode, and steady conduction
between cation-selective surfaces in cross flow. The last problem is motivated

rate between a projection of the original process through a partition function
and a DTMC on the correspondingly partitioned state space. Finding the reduced
model with minimal cost is computationally expensive, as it requires an
exhaustive search among all state space partitions, and an exact evaluation of
the reduction cost for each candidate partition. Our approach deals with the
latter problem by minimizing an upper bound on the reduction cost instead of
minimizing the exact cost; The proposed upper bound is easy to compute and it
is tight if the original chain is lumpable with respect to the partition. Then,
we express the problem in the form of information bottleneck optimization, and
propose using the agglomerative information bottleneck algorithm for searching
a sub-optimal partition greedily, rather than exhaustively. The theory is
illustrated with examples and one application scenario in the context of

using our own data from multiple sources (combined n = 59,994) we have
generated and robustly validated the first model of ovarian volume from
conception to 82 years of age. This model shows that 69% of the variation in
ovarian volume is due to age alone. We have shown that in the average case
ovarian volume rises from 0.7 mL (95% CI 0.4 -- 1.1 mL) at 2 years of age to a
peak of 7.7 mL (95% CI 6.5 -- 9.2 mL) at 20 years of age with a subsequent
decline to about 2.8mL (95% CI 2.7 -- 2.9 mL) at the menopause and smaller
volumes thereafter. Our model allows us to generate normal values and ranges
for ovarian volume throughout life. This is the first validated normative model
of ovarian volume from conception to old age; it will be of use in the
diagnosis and management of a number of diverse gynaecological and reproductive
conditions in females from birth to menopause and beyond.

thresholds of the protograph codes over such channels with different fading
depths (i.e., different values of $m$) by exploiting the modified protograph
extrinsic information transfer (PEXIT) algorithm. Furthermore, based on the
PEXIT analysis and using Gaussian approximation, we derive the bit-error-rate
(BER) expressions for the error-free (EF) relaying protocol and
decode-and-forward (DF) relaying protocol. We finally compare the threshold
with the theoretical BER and the simulated BER results of the protograph codes.
It reveals that the performance of DF protocol is approximately the same as
that of EF protocol. Moreover, the theoretical BER expressions, which are shown
to be reasonably consistent with the decoding thresholds and the simulated
BERs, are able to evaluate the system performance and predict the decoding
threshold with lower complexity as compared to the modified PEXIT algorithm. As
a result, this work can facilitate the design of the protograph codes for the
wireless communication systems.

Irregular sampling often causes clumps of measurements and gaps with no data

the overall accuracy and precision of the estimators with respect to the

Automated classification procedures employing statistical parameters weighted

radiation. This sensitivity is tested, using models of the time-dependent

density depends strongly on both fire frequency and tree-tree competition

updates its internal state accordingly. The interpretation of edits and the
policies for proof document processing are determined by the prover. The editor
front-end merely takes care of visual rendering of formal document content.
  Here we report on an experiment to connect Coq to the PIDE infrastructure of
Isabelle. This requires to re-implement the core PIDE protocol layer of
Isabelle/ML in OCaml. The payload for semantic processing of proof document
content is restricted to lexical analysis in the sense of existing CoqIde
functionality. This is sufficient as proof-of-concept for PIDE connectivity.
Actual proof processing is then a matter of improving Coq towards timeless and

implementation worked out smoothly and required minimal changes to the refined

fluids which, for high enough density, approaches a glassy nonergodic state.
The nature of the nonergodic state can be characterized by the associated
static equilibrium state. In particular, systems driven by Smoluchowski or
Newtonian dynamics share the same static equilibrium and nonergodic states.
That these systems share the same nonergodic states is a highly nontrivial
statement and requires establishing a number of results. In the high-density
regime one finds that an equilibrating system decays via a three-step process
identified in mode-coupling theory (MCT). For densities greater than a critical
density one has time-power-law decay with exponents a and b. There are sets of
linear fluctuation dissipation relations (FDRs) which connect the cumulants of
these two fields. The form of the FDRs is the same for both Smoluchowski or
Newtonian dynamics. While we show this universality of nonergodic states within
perturbation theory, we expect it to be true more generally.
  The nature of the approach to the nonergodic state has been suggested by MCT.
It has been a point of contention that MCT is a phenomenological theory and not
a systematic theory with prospects for improvement. Recently a systematic
theory has been developed. It naturally allows one to calculate
self-consistently density cumulants in a perturbation expansion in a
pseudo-potential. At leading order one obtains a kinetic kernel quadratic in
the density. This is a ""one-loop"" theory like MCT. At this one-loop level one
finds vertex corrections which depend on the three-point equilibrium cumulants.
Here we assume these vertex-corrections can be ignored and focus on the
higher-order loops. We show that one can sum up all of the loop contributions.
The higher-order loops do not change the nonergodic state parameters
substantially.

function (IMF) by including the time-dependence, and by including the impact of
magnetic field. The predicted mass spectra are similar to the time independent
ones with slightly shallower slopes at large masses and peak locations shifted
toward smaller masses by a factor of a few. Assuming that star-forming clumps
follow Larson type relations, we obtain core mass functions in good agreement
with the observationally derived IMF, in particular when taking into account
the thermodynamics of the gas. The time-dependent theory directly yields an
analytical expression for the star formation rate (SFR) at cloud scales. The
SFR values agree well with the observational determinations of various Galactic
molecular clouds. Furthermore, we show that the SFR does not simply depend
linearly on density, as sometimes claimed in the literature, but depends also
strongly on the clump mass/size, which yields the observed scatter. We stress,
however, that {\it any} SFR theory depends, explicitly or implicitly, on very
uncertain assumptions like clump boundaries or the mass of the most massive
stars that can form in a given clump, making the final determinations uncertain
by a factor of a few. Finally, we derive a fully time-dependent model for the
IMF by considering a clump, or a distribution of clumps accreting at a constant
rate and thus whose physical properties evolve with time. In spite of its
simplicity, this model reproduces reasonably well various features observed in
numerical simulations of converging flows. Based on this general theory, we
present a paradigm for star formation and the IMF.

objects, such as brown dwarfs. However, such extreme cases are challenging for
planet formation models. Recent sub-millimeter observations of disks around
brown dwarf measured low spectral indices of the continuum emission that
suggest that dust grains grow to mm-sizes even in these very low mass
environments. To understand the first steps of planet formation in scaled-down
versions of T-Tauri disks, we investigate the physical conditions that can
theoretically explain the growth from interstellar dust to millimeter-sized
grains in disks around brown dwarf. We modeled the evolution of dust particles
under conditions of low-mass disks around brown dwarfs. We used coagulation,
fragmentation and disk-structure models to simulate the evolution of dust, with
zero and non-zero radial drift. For the non-zero radial drift, we considered
strong inhomogeneities in the gas surface density profile that mimic long-lived
pressure bumps in the disk. We studied different scenarios that could lead to
an agreement between theoretical models and the spectral slope found by
millimeter observations. We find that fragmentation is less likely and rapid
inward drift is more significant for particles in brown dwarf disks than in
T-Tauri disks. We present different scenarios that can nevertheless explain
millimeter-sized grains. As an example, a model that combines the following
parameters can fit the millimeter fluxes measured for brown dwarf disks: strong
pressure inhomogeneities of $\sim$ 40% of amplitude, a small radial extent
$\sim$ 15 AU, a moderate turbulence strength $\alpha_{\mathrm{turb}}= 10^{-3}$,
and average fragmentation velocities for ices $v_f = 10 m s^{-1}$.

re-deriving stellar parameters for 451 stars with high resolution and

such discs was plotted. We apply the present model to black-hole X-ray binary

critical accretion rate. Our results show clearly that the surface temperature
is strongly depends on the thermal conduction, the magnetic field and advection
parameter. However we see that thermal conduction acts to oppose the
temperature gradient as we expect and observed luminosity of the disc will
reduce when thermal conduction is high. We have shown that in this model the

finite-state Markov decision processes, where the objective is to optimize both
the expected mean-payoff performance of the system and its stability.
  We argue that the basic theoretical notion of expressing the stability in
terms of the variance of the mean-payoff (called global variance in our paper)
is not always sufficient, since it ignores possible instabilities on respective
runs. For this reason we propose alernative definitions of stability, which we
call local and hybrid variance, and which express how rewards on each run
deviate from the run's own mean-payoff and from the expected mean-payoff,
respectively.
  We show that a strategy ensuring both the expected mean-payoff and the
variance below given bounds requires randomization and memory, under all the
above semantics of variance. We then look at the problem of determining whether
there is a such a strategy. For the global variance, we show that the problem
is in PSPACE, and that the answer can be approximated in pseudo-polynomial
time. For the hybrid variance, the analogous decision problem is in NP, and a
polynomial-time approximating algorithm also exists. For local variance, we
show that the decision problem is in NP. Since the overall performance can be
traded for stability (and vice versa), we also present algorithms for
approximating the associated Pareto curve in all the three cases.
  Finally, we study a special case of the decision problems, where we require a
given expected mean-payoff together with zero variance. Here we show that the
problems can be all solved in polynomial time.

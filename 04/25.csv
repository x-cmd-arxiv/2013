an S3 model with only one Higgs electroweak doublet, where the flavour symmetry
must be broken in order to produce an acceptable pattern of masses and mixing
for fermions. Then, we analyse different S3 models, where the flavour symmetry
is preserved as an exact, but hidden symmetry of the low energy spectra, after
the electroweak symmetry breaking. The latter models require the addition of
two more Higgs electroweak doublets which are accommodated in an S3 doublet. We
also explore the consequences of adding a fourth Higgs electroweak doublet,
thus occupying all three irreducible representations of S3. We show how the
various S3-invariant mass matrices of the different models can reproduce the
two texture zeroes and Nearest Neighbour Interaction matrix forms, which have
been found to provide a viable and universal treatment of mixing for both
quarks and leptons. We also find analytical and exact expressions for the CKM
matrix of the models in terms of quark mass ratios. Finally, we compare the
expressions of the CKM matrix of the different S3 models with the most up to
date values of masses and mixing in the quark sector, via a chi^2 analysis. We
find that the analytical expressions we derived reproduce remarkably well the

Dirac-Kronig-Penney model analysis of the tight-binding Aharonov-Bohm behavior
reveals that the graphene quasiparticle in an armchair hexagonal ring is a

position-dependent mass term, akin to the zero-energy fermionic solitons with
fractional charge familiar from quantum field theory and from the theory of
polyacetylene. The topological origins of the above behavior are highlighted by
contrasting it with the case of a trigonal armchair ring, where we find that
the quasiparticle excitations behave as familiar Dirac fermions with a constant

low-kinetic-energy nonrelativistic regime of a leptonlike massive fermion. A
onedimensional relativistic Lagrangian formalism coupling a fermionic and a

that the 1990 paper was published in the Journal of Statistical Physics, the
first paper of its kind in the journal. It was shown how a minority in power
can preserve its leadership using bottom-up democratic elections. However such
a bias holds only down to some critical value of minimum support. The results
were used latter to explain the sudden collapse of European communist parties

mechanisms by which a very small minority party can get a substantial
representation at higher levels of the hierarchy when the other two competing
parties are big. Additional surprising results are obtained, which enlighten
the complexity of three-party democratic bottom-up voting. In particular, the
unexpected outcomes of local voting alliances are singled out. Unbalanced
democratic situations are exhibited with strong asymmetries between the actual
bottom support of a party and its associated share of power at the top
leadership. Subtle strategies are identified for a party to maximize its hold
on the top leadership. The results are also valid to describe opinion dynamics

and graphene sheets have been manufactured. While their macroscopic strength
remains 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than their theoretical strength, and is
thus comparable to that of current commercial fibres, recent progress has been
made in significantly increasing toughness. In particular, researchers have
produced extremely tough nanotube fibres with toughness modulus values of up to
570 J/g, 870 J/g and very recently, including graphene, reaching 970 J/g, thus
well surpassing that of spider silk (170 J/g, with a record for a giant
riverine orb spider of 390 J/g and Kevlar (80 J/g). In this letter, thanks to a
new paradigm based on structural mechanics rather than on materials science, we
present the Egg of Columbus for making fibres with unprecedented toughness: a
slider, in the simplest form just a knot, is introduced as smart frictional
element to dissipate energy and in general to reshape the fibre constitutive
law, showing evidence of a previously hidden toughness, strictly related to the
specific strength of the material. The result is a nearly perfectly plastic
constitutive law, with a shape mimicking that of spider silk. The proof of
concept is experimentally realized making the world toughest fibre, increasing
the toughness modulus of a commercial Endumax fibre from 44 J/g up to 1070 J/g.
The maximal achievable toughness is expected for graphene, with an ideal value
of 100000 J/g.

mechanism are considered. Multistationarity (i.e.\ the existence of at least
two positive steady state solutions of the associated polynomial dynamical
system) has been analyzed and established in several contributions. It is, for
example, known that there exist values for he rate constants where
multistationarity occurs. However, nothing else is known about these rate
constants.
  Here we present a sign condition that is necessary and sufficient for
multistationarity in $n$-site sequential, distributive phosphorylation. We
express this sign condition in terms of linear systems and show that solutions
of these systems define rate constants where multistationarity is possible. We
then present, for $n\geq 2$, a collection of {\em feasible} linear systems and
hence give a new and independent proof that multistationarity is possible for
$n\geq 2$. Moreover, our results allow to explicitly obtain values for the rate
constants where multistationarity is possible. Hence we believe that, for the
first time, a systematic exploration of the region in parameter space where
multistationarity occurs has become possible.One consequence of our work is
that, for any pair of steady states, the ratio of the steady state
concentrations of kinase-substrate complexes equals that of
phosphatase-substrate complexes.

  We use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method for sampling from the

terms of the number of colours and the fugacity for the corresponding models.
For both models the bounds we get are only within small constant factors from
the conjectured ones by the statistical physicists.
  We use Path Coupling to show rapid mixing. For k and \lambda in the range of
our interest the technical challenge is to cope with the high degree vertices,
i.e. vertices of degree much larger than the expected degree d. The usual
approach to this problem is to consider block updates rather than single vertex
updates for the Markov chain. Taking appropriately defined blocks the effect of
high degree vertices somehow diminishes. However, devising such a construction
of blocks is a highly non trivial task.
  We develop for a first time a weighting schema for the paths of the
underlying graph. Vertices which belong to ""light"" paths, only, can be placed
at the boundaries of the blocks. Then the tree-like local structure of G(n,d/n)
allows the construction of simple structured blocks.

investigated: one of them, epsilon, acts between adsorbed particles, while the
other one, eta, between activated and adsorbed particles. To this end, a
specific lattice-gas model on a triangular, square, and hexagonal lattice is
considered with an attractive epsilon and an attractive or repulsive eta, both
restricted to nearest neighbors. For all three lattices the influence is
qualitatively the same. Namely, when eta is neglected, then epsilon is shown to
decelerate diffusion with a rate exponential in epsilon and inverse
temperature. Moreover, when eta is present and epsilon is fixed, then a
sufficiently attractive eta (relative to epsilon) accelerates diffusion
exponentially fast in eta and inverse temperature. However, quite surprisingly,
a repulsive or slightly attractive eta has practically no effect on diffusion.
Finally, when eta is set proportional to epsilon via a parameter $a$, surface
diffusion is exponentially accelerated (decelerated) for $a$ above (below) a
threshold value equal to 4, 5/4, and 7/8 for the three lattices. Thus, an eta
of strength comparable to epsilon is enough to boost diffusion on the square

the boost on the triangular lattice.

modulations. We found that GPSC can very effectively correct for the short and
long term stellar activity and instrumental systematics. Additionally we run
the GPSC on both real and simulated transit data, finding transit depths
consistent with the original ones. Consequently we considered 10 hours of
continuous observations: daily, every other day and weekly, and we used the
GPSC to reconstruct the lightcurves. When data are recorded more frequently
than once every five days we found that our approach is able to extrapolate the
stellar flux at the 10$^{-4}$ level compared to the full stellar flux. These
results show a great potential of GPSC to isolate the relevant astrophysical

$N$ bosons unitarily transformed from the input modes to the output modes of a
unitary network are expressed through a multidimensional integral with the
integrand containing a large parameter (N) in the exponent. The integral
representation allows an asymptotic estimate of bosonic probability amplitudes
up to a multiplicative error of order 1/N by the saddle point method. The
estimate depends on solution of the scaling problem for the $M\times
M$-dimensional unitary network matrix: to find the left and right diagonal
matrices which scale the unitary matrix to a matrix which has specified row and
column sums (equal, respectively, to the distributions of bosons in the input

For simple saddle points, an explicit formula giving the asymptotic estimate of
bosonic probability amplitudes is derived. Performance of the approximation and
the scaling of the relative error with N are studied for two-mode network (the
beam-splitter), where the saddle-points are roots of a quadratic and an exact
analytical formula for the probability amplitudes is available, and for
three-mode network (the tritter).

cavity cooling of an optically levitated nanoparticle consisting of

our cooling rates are sufficient for ground-state cooling, provided that
optical trapping at a vacuum level of 10e-7 millibar can be realized in the
future, e.g., by employing additional active-feedback schemes to stabilize the
optical trap in three dimensions. This paves the way for a new light-matter

expand. But what selects the rest frame of nucleation? This question has been
recently addressed in [1] in the context of Schwinger pair production in 1+1
dimensions, by using a model detector in order to probe the nucleated pairs.
The analysis in [1] showed that, for a constant external electric field, the
adiabatic ""in"" vacuum of charged particles is Lorentz invariant, and in this
case pairs tend to nucleate preferentially at rest with respect to the
detector. Here, we sharpen this picture by showing that the typical relative
velocity between the frame of nucleation and that of the detector is at most of
order \Delta v ~ S_E^{-1/3} << 1. Here, S_E >> 1 is the action of the instanton
describing pair creation. The bound \Delta v coincides with the minimum
uncertainty in the velocity of a non-relativistic charged particle embedded in
a constant electric field. A velocity of order \Delta v is reached after a time
interval of order \Delta t ~ S_E^{-1/3} r_0 << r_0 past the turning point in
the semiclassical trajectory, where r_0 is the size of the instanton. If the
interaction takes place in the vicinity of the turning point, the semiclassical
description of collision does not apply. Nonetheless, we find that even in this
case there is still a strong asymmetry in the momentum transferred from the
nucleated particles to the detector, in the direction of expansion after the
turning point. We conclude that the correlation between the rest frame of
nucleation and that of the detector is exceedingly sharp.

conventional point-to-point MIMO: it works with cheap single-antenna terminals,
a rich scattering environment is not required, and resource allocation is
simplified because every active terminal utilizes all of the time-frequency
bins. However, multi-user MIMO, as originally envisioned with roughly equal
numbers of service-antennas and terminals and frequency division duplex
operation, is not a scalable technology. Massive MIMO (also known as
""Large-Scale Antenna Systems"", ""Very Large MIMO"", ""Hyper MIMO"", ""Full-Dimension
MIMO"" & ""ARGOS"") makes a clean break with current practice through the use of a
large excess of service-antennas over active terminals and time division duplex
operation. Extra antennas help by focusing energy into ever-smaller regions of
space to bring huge improvements in throughput and radiated energy efficiency.
Other benefits of massive MIMO include the extensive use of inexpensive
low-power components, reduced latency, simplification of the media access
control (MAC) layer, and robustness to intentional jamming. The anticipated
throughput depend on the propagation environment providing asymptotically
orthogonal channels to the terminals, but so far experiments have not disclosed
any limitations in this regard. While massive MIMO renders many traditional
research problems irrelevant, it uncovers entirely new problems that urgently
need attention: the challenge of making many low-cost low-precision components
that work effectively together, acquisition and synchronization for
newly-joined terminals, the exploitation of extra degrees of freedom provided
by the excess of service-antennas, reducing internal power consumption to
achieve total energy efficiency reductions, and finding new deployment
scenarios. This paper presents an overview of the massive MIMO concept and
contemporary research.

rigidity upon lowering the external pressure towards zero. At zero pressure, we

particle fluctuations generated by the solitary-wave decay, can be viewed as a
granular analogue of temperature. Their presence is manifested by two emergent
macroscopic properties absent in the unperturbed granular packing: a finite
pressure that scales with the injected energy (akin to a granular temperature)
and an anomalous viscosity that arises even when the microscopic mechanisms of
energy dissipation are negligible. Consistent with the interpretation of this

longer power law decay and suggest simple models to explain these two regimes.

transmission is deniable from an eavesdropper Willie. That is, if Willie
listening to Alice's transmissions over a ""significantly noisier"" BSC than the
one to Bob, he should be unable to estimate even whether Alice is transmitting.
We consider two scenarios. In our first scenario, we assume that the channel
transition probability from Alice to Bob and Willie is perfectly known to all

known to Willie (with no common randomness between Alice and Bob), we prove
that over 'n' channel uses Alice can transmit a message of length O(sqrt{n})

this quantity decreases when moving away from the inter-cluster axis between a

bring the membrane to within ~ 10-20 nm above a circular post covered with SiOx
or Au until a critical point is reached whereby the membrane snaps into
adhesive contact with the post. Continuous measurements of the deforming
membrane with an AFM coupled with a theoretical model allow us to deduce the
magnitude of the interfacial forces between graphene and SiOx and graphene and
Au. The nature of the interfacial forces at ~ 10 - 20 nm separations is
consistent with an inverse fourth power distance dependence, implying that the
interfacial forces are dominated by van der Waals interactions. Furthermore,
the strength of the interactions is found to increase linearly with the number
of graphene layers. The experimental approach can be used to measure the
strength of the interfacial forces for other atomically thin two-dimensional
materials, and help guide the development of nanomechanical devices such as

Standard Model background in the Drell-Yan channel at the LHC are studied in
detail. The final state with two oppositely charged leptons is considered. The
interference contribution to the new physics signal, currently not fully taken
into account by experimental collaborations in Z'-searches and in the
interpretation of the results, can be substantial. It may affect limits or
discovery prospects of Z' at the LHC. As the Z'-boson interference is
model-dependent, a proper treatment would a priori require a dedicated
experimental analysis for each particular model. Doing so could potentially
improve the sensitivity to new physics, but would require significantly more
experimental effort.
  At the same time, it is shown that one can define an invariant mass window,
valid for a wide range of models, for which the contribution of the
model-dependent interference to the Beyond the Standard Model signal is reduced
to O(10%), comparable to the level of the combined uncertainty from parton
densities and higher order corrections. This quasi-model-independent ""magic
cut"" does not scale with the mass of the Z'-boson and is approximately constant
over a large range of masses. Such control of the interference effects relies
on not-too-small branching ratios of Z' to leptons (typically of at least a few
percent) which can be suppressed, however, by additional new decay channels of
the Z'; a small width-to-mass ratio alone does not guarantee the interference
to be small over an arbitrary kinematic range. Under the general assumption
that these new decay channels of Z' are not dominant, one can perform
quasi-model-independent analyses, preserving the current scheme used by the
experimental collaborations for the Z'-boson search using the suggested
invariant mass window cut.

quiescent fluid, and the constriction (the pinching gap) corresponds to the
space between a plane wall and a second, fixed sphere of the same size (the
obstacle). The results show that, due to inertia and/or the presence of a
geometric constriction the particles attain smaller separations to the
obstacle. We then relate the minimum surface-to-surface separation to the
effect that short-range, repulsive non-hydrodynamic interactions (such as
solid-solid contact due to surface roughness, electrostatic double layer
repulsion, etc.) would have on the particle trajectories. In particular, using
a simple hard-core repulsive potential model for such interactions, we infer
that the particles would experience larger lateral displacements moving through
the pinching gap as inertia increases and/or the aperture of the constriction
decreases. Thus, separation of particles based on differences in density is in
principle possible, owing to the differences in inertia associated with them.
We also discuss the case of significant inertia, in which the presence of a
small construction may hinder separation by reducing inertia effects.

same problem. That is, given two graphs that have the same vertices and edges
and differ only in edge-weights, and given two threshold-weights L_1 and L_2,
we show how to approximately count the s-t paths that have length at most L_1
in the first graph and length at most L_2 in the second graph. We believe that
our algorithms should find application in counting approximate solutions of
related optimization problems, where finding an (optimum) solution can be
reduced to the computation of a shortest path in a purpose-built auxiliary

single scalar dark energy models may be constrained. However, the generality of
the model makes it cumbersome to manipulate. In this paper, we demonstrate that
when considering linear perturbations about a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker

two of which are constrained by the background evolution. We utilise the ideas
of the Effective Field Theory of Inflation/Dark Energy to explicitly construct
these six functions of time in terms of the free functions appearing in

time are required to completely specify the linear behavior of the theory in
this limit, which can further be reduced if the background evolution is fixed.
This presents a significantly reduced parameter space from the original
presentation of Horndeski's theory, giving hope to the possibility of
constraining the parameter space. This work provides a cross-check for previous
work on linear perturbations in this theory, and also generalizes it to include
spatial curvature.

diagnostics. The new HARPSpol longitudinal field measurements for the extreme

galaxies (the CGM, 300 pkpc), finding that the incidence of absorbers in the

find that there are fractionally more high-NHI absorbers than low-NHI absorbers
in the CGM compared to the IGM, leading to a shallower power law fit to the CGM
frequency distribution. We use these new measurements to calculate the total
opacity of the IGM and CGM to hydrogen-ionizing photons, finding significantly
higher opacity than most previous studies, especially from absorbers with
log(NHI) < 17.2. Reproducing the opacity measured in our data as well as the
incidence of absorbers with log(NHI) > 17.2 requires a broken power law
parameterization of the frequency distribution with a break near log(NHI) ~ 15.
We compute new estimates of the mean free path (mfp) to hydrogen-ionizing
photons at z=2.4, finding mfp = 147 +- 15 Mpc when considering only IGM
opacity. If instead, we consider photons emanating from a high-z star-forming
galaxy and account for the local excess opacity due to the surrounding CGM of
the galaxy itself, the mean free path is reduced to mfp = 121 +- 15 Mpc. These
mfp measurements are smaller than recent estimates and should inform future
studies of the metagalactic UV background and of ionizing sources at z~2-3.

We study the relation between the supermassive black hole masses M_BH and the
globular cluster system velocity dispersions sigma_GC using an updated and
improved sample of 21 galaxies. We exploit the dichotomy of globular cluster
system colours, to test if the blue and red globular clusters correlate
differently with black hole mass. This may be expected if they trace the
potentially different formation history of the halo and of the bulge of the
host galaxy respectively. We find that M_BH correlates with the total GC system
velocity dispersion, although not as strongly as claimed by recent work of
Sadoun & Colin. We also examine the M_BH - sigma_GC relation for
barred/bar-less and core/non-core galaxies, finding no significant difference,
and for the first time we quantify the impact of radial gradients in the GC
system velocity dispersion profile on the M_BH - sigma_GC relation. We
additionally predict M_BH in 13 galaxies, including dwarf elliptical galaxies

discriminate between the bulge/halo scenario. Although there is a hint that the
red GC velocity dispersion might correlate better with M_BH than the blue GC
velocity dispersion, the number statistics are still too low to be certain.

planet orbiting near the inner edge of the habitable zone of a low-mass star.
Our characterization of the host star Kepler-61 is based upon a comparison with
the set of spectroscopically similar stars with directly-measured radii and
temperatures. We apply a stellar prior drawn from the weighted mean of these
properties, in tandem with the Kepler photometry, to infer a planetary radius
for Kepler-61b of 2.15+/-0.13 R_Earth and an equilibrium temperature of
273+/-13 K (given its period of 59.87756+/-0.00020 days and assuming a
planetary albedo of 0.3). The technique of leveraging the physical properties
of nearby ""proxy"" stars allows for an independent check on stellar
characterization via the traditional measurements with stellar spectra and
evolutionary models. In this case, such a check had implications for the
putative habitability of Kepler-61b: the planet is 10% warmer and larger than
inferred from K-band spectral characterization. From the Kepler photometry, we
estimate a stellar rotation period of 36 days, which implies a stellar age of
>1 Gyr. We summarize the evidence for the planetary nature of the Kepler-61
transit signal, which we conclude is 30,000 times more likely to be due to a
planet than a blend scenario. Finally, we discuss possible compositions for
Kepler-61b with a comparison to theoretical models as well as to known
exoplanets with similar radii and dynamically measured masses.

in I Zw 18, the blue compact dwarf galaxy with the lowest known metallicity. We
find the highest flux yet observed, corresponding to an intrinsic luminosity
near 1E40 erg/s establishing it as an ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX). The
energy spectrum is dominated by disk emission with a weak or absent Compton
component and there is no significant timing noise; both are indicative of the
thermal state of stellar-mass black hole X-ray binaries and inconsistent with
the Compton-dominated state typical of most ULX spectra. A previous measurement
of the X-ray spectrum shows a harder spectrum that is well described by a
powerlaw. Thus, the binary appears to exhibit spectral states similar to those
observed from stellar-mass black hole binaries. If the hard state occurs in the
range of luminosities found for the hard state in stellar-mass black hole
binaries, then the black hole mass must be at least 85 solar masses. Spectral
fitting of the thermal state shows that disk luminosities for which thin disk
models are expected to be valid are produced only for relatively high disk
inclinations, >= 60 degrees, and rapid black hole spins. We find a_* > 0.98 and
M > 154 solar masses for a disk inclination of 60 degrees. Higher inclinations
produce higher masses and somewhat lower spins.

for SUSY models: \Delta_{EW} compares the Z mass to each separate weak scale
contribution to m_Z while \Delta_{HS} compares the Z mass to high scale input
parameters and their consequent renormalizaton group evolution (1/\Delta is the
% of fine tuning). While the paradigm mSUGRA/CMSSM model has been shown to be
highly finetuned under both parameters (\Delta_{EW}> 10^2 and \Delta_{HS}>
10^3), the two-parameter non-universal Higgs model (NUHM2) in the context of
radiatively-driven natural SUSY (RNS) enjoys \Delta_{EW} as low as 10, while
\Delta_{HS} remains > 10^3. We investigate finetuning in the 19-free-parameter
SUGRA model (SUGRA19). We find that with 19 free parameters, the lowest
\Delta_{EW} points are comparable to what can be achieved in NUHM2 with just 6
free parameters. However, in SUGRA19, \Delta_{HS} can now also reach as low as
5-10. The conditions which lead to low \Delta_{HS} include m_{H_u} m_Z at the
high scale, with non-universal gaugino masses M_{1,2}>> M_3 also at m_{GUT}.
The low \Delta_{HS} models are severely constrained by b\to s\gamma branching
fraction. In both cases of low \Delta_{EW} and \Delta_{HS}, the superpotential
\mu parameter should be \sim 100-300 GeV. While SUSY models with low EWFT may
or may not be discoverable at LHC, the predicted light higgsinos must show up
at a linear e^+e^- collider with \sqrt{s}> 2|\mu |.

multiple types and scales of porosity, and to exhibit multirate
mobile-immobile-domain mass transfer characteristics at field scale. The data
are reanalyzed here and null-space Monte Carlo analysis is used to facilitate
objective model selection. Prediction (or residual) bias is adopted as a
measure of the model structural error. The analysis clearly shows single- and
double-porosity models are structurally deficient, yielding late-time residual
bias that grows with time. On the other hand, the multirate model yields
unbiased predictions consistent with the late-time -5/2 slope diagnostic of

imaging survey of stellar populations in the Tarantula Nebula in the Large

utilizes the capability of HST to operate the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS)
and the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) in parallel to study this remarkable region
in the near-ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared spectral regions, including
narrow band H$\alpha$ images. The combination of all these bands provides a
unique multi-band view. The resulting maps of the stellar content of the
Tarantula Nebula within its main body provide the basis for investigations of
star formation in an environment resembling the extreme conditions found in
starburst galaxies and in the early Universe. Access to detailed properties of
individual stars allows us to begin to reconstruct the evolution of the stellar
skeleton of the Tarantula Nebula over space and time with parcsec-scale
resolution. In this first paper we describe the observing strategy, the
photometric techniques, and the upcoming data products from this survey and

(Newtonian viscous fluid model). The analysis shows that the results are
similar to those obtained for the purely elastic case; inter alia, the normals
to the planes of constant phase and to the planes of constant amplitude must be
orthogonal and conjugate with respect to the B-ellipsoid, where B is the left
Cauchy-Green strain tensor associated with the initial large static

axes of strain lie in the bounding plane, which itself remains free of

nature. A surface wave is propagated sinusoidally along the bounding surface in
the direction of a principal axis of strain and decays away from the surface.
The exact secular equation is derived by a direct method for such a principal
surface wave; it is cubic in a quantity whose square is linearly related to the
squared wave speed. For the prestrained material, replacing the squared wave
speed by zero gives an explicit bifurcation, or stability, criterion.
Conditions on the existence and uniqueness of surface waves are given. The
bifurcation criterion is derived for specific strain energies in the case of
four isotropic constraints: those of incompressibility, Bell, constant area,

systems, there are few for complex symmetric, skew symmetric, or skew Hermitian
systems, which are increasingly important in modern applications including
quantum dynamics, electromagnetics, and power systems. For a large consistent
complex symmetric system, one may apply a non-Hermitian Krylov subspace method
disregarding the symmetry of $A$, or a Hermitian Krylov solver on the
equivalent normal equation or an augmented system twice the original dimension.
These have the disadvantages of increasing either memory, conditioning, or
computational costs. An exception is a special version of QMR by Freund (1992),
but that may be affected by non-benign breakdowns unless look-ahead is
implemented; furthermore, it is designed for only consistent and nonsingular
problems. For skew symmetric systems, Greif and Varah (2009) adapted CG for
nonsingular skew symmetric linear systems that are necessarily and
restrictively of even order.

Choi, Paige and Saunders (2011) to complex symmetric, skew symmetric, and skew
Hermitian systems. In particular, MINRES-QLP uses a rank-revealing QLP
decomposition of the tridiagonal matrix from a three-term recurrent
complex-symmetric Lanczos process. Whether the systems are real or complex,
singular or invertible, compatible or inconsistent, MINRES-QLP computes the
unique minimum-length, i.e., pseudoinverse, solutions. It is a significant
extension of MINRES by Paige and Saunders (1975) with enhanced stability and
capability.

finite dipole is a pair of equal and opposite strength point vortices separated
by a finite distance. The dynamics of multiple finite dipoles in an unbounded
inviscid uid was first proposed by Tchieu, Kanso & Newton in [1] as a model
that captures the ""far- field"" hydrodynamic interactions in fish schools. In
this paper, we formulate the equations of motion governing the dynamics of
finite-dipoles in a doubly-periodic domain. We show that a single dipole in a
doubly-periodic domain exhibits periodic and aperiodic behavior, in contrast to
a single dipole in an unbounded domain. In the case of two dipoles in
doubly-periodic domain, we identify a number of interesting trajectories
including collision, collision avoidance, and passive synchronization of the
dipoles. We then examine two types of dipole lattices: rectangular and diamond.
We verify that these lattices are in a state of relative equilibrium and show
that the rectangular lattice is unstable while the diamond lattice is linearly
stable for a range of perturbations. We conclude by commenting on the insights
these models provide in the context of fish schooling.

using the program FIRST. Previous studies using FIRST were designed to analyze
the rigidity and flexibility of proteins using a single static (snapshot)
structure. It is however well known that proteins can undergo spontaneous
sub-molecular unfolding and refolding, or conformational dynamics, even under
conditions that strongly favour a well-defined native structure. These (local)
unfolding events result in a large number of conformers that differ from each
other very slightly. In this context, proteins are better represented as a
thermodynamic ensemble of `native-like' structures, and not just as a single
static low-energy structure.
  Working with this notion, we introduce a novel FIRST-based approach for
predicting rigidity/flexibility of the protein ensemble by (i) averaging the
hydrogen bonding strengths from the entire ensemble and (ii) by refining the
mathematical model of hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, we combine our
FIRST-ensemble rigidity predictions with the ensemble solvent accessibility
data of the backbone amides and propose a novel computational method which uses
both rigidity and solvent accessibility for predicting hydrogen-deuterium
exchange (HDX). To validate our predictions, we report a novel site specific
HDX experiment which characterizes the native structural ensemble of
Acylphosphatase from hyperthermophile Sulfolobus solfataricus (Sso AcP).
  The sub-structural conformational dynamics that is observed by HDX data, is
closely matched with the FIRST-ensemble rigidity predictions, which could not
be attained using the traditional single `snapshot' rigidity analysis.
Moreover, the computational predictions of regions that are protected from HDX
and those that undergo exchange are in very good agreement with the
experimental HDX profile of Sso AcP.

the marginals given evidence and learning from (partial) interpretations have
not really been addressed for probabilistic logic programs before.
  The first contribution of this paper is a suite of efficient algorithms for
various inference tasks. It is based on a conversion of the program and the
queries and evidence to a weighted Boolean formula. This allows us to reduce
the inference tasks to well-studied tasks such as weighted model counting,
which can be solved using state-of-the-art methods known from the graphical
model and knowledge compilation literature. The second contribution is an
algorithm for parameter estimation in the learning from interpretations
setting. The algorithm employs Expectation Maximization, and is built on top of
the developed inference algorithms.
  The proposed approach is experimentally evaluated. The results show that the
inference algorithms improve upon the state-of-the-art in probabilistic logic
programming and that it is indeed possible to learn the parameters of a

while the artificial magnetism can still be achieved in a center symmetric
periodic structure. Furthermore, we numerically check the effective parameters
through the dispersion law and transmission curves of a stack with two
dielectric layers against that of an effective bianisotropic medium: they
present a good agreement in the low frequency (acoustic) band until the first
stop band, where the analyticity of the logarithm function of transfer matrix

that the drift and diffusion depends on the volume present on both sides of the

must also be included as birth-death terms in the Fokker-Planck equation. All
quantities involved in the equation can be calibrated using high-frequency data

approximately scale invariant, i.e., the only relevant variable is the ratio of
the current volume in the queue to its average value. While the latter shows
intraday seasonalities and strong variability across stocks and time periods,
the dynamics of the rescaled volumes is universal. In terms of rescaled
volumes, we found that the drift has a complex two-dimensional structure, which
is a sum of a gradient contribution and a rotational contribution, both stable
across stocks and time. This drift term is entirely responsible for the
dynamical correlations between the ask queue and the bid queue.

starless gas clump at the onset of high-mass star formation. Methods: Based on
Herschel continuum data we identify a massive gas clump that remains
far-infrared dark up to 100mum wavelengths. The fragmentation and dynamical
properties are investigated by means of Plateau de Bure Interferometer and
Nobeyama 45m single-dish spectral line and continuum observations. Results: The
massive gas reservoir fragments at spatial scales of ~18000AU in four cores.
Comparing the spatial extent of this high-mass region with intermediate- to
low-mass starless cores from the literature, we find that linear sizes do not
vary significantly over the whole mass regime. However, the high-mass regions
squeeze much more gas into these similar volumes and hence have orders of
magnitude larger densities. The fragmentation properties of the presented
low-to high-mass regions are consistent with gravitational instable Jeans
fragmentation. Furthermore, we find multiple velocity components associated
with the resolved cores. Recent radiative transfer hydrodynamic simulations of
the dynamic collapse of massive gas clumps also result in multiple velocity
components along the line of sight because of the clumpy structure of the
regions. This result is supported by a ratio between viral and total gas mass
for the whole region <1. Conclusions: This apparently still starless high-mass
gas clump exhibits clear signatures of early fragmentation and dynamic collapse
prior to the formation of an embedded heating source. A comparison with regions
of lower mass reveals that the linear size of star-forming regions does not
necessarily have to vary much for different masses, however, the mass
reservoirs and gas densities are orders of magnitude enhanced for high-mass
regions compared to their lower-mass siblings.

occupancy of the reactive PU as a 4-state discrete-time Markov chain. We
formulate the optimal OSA design for SU throughput maximization as a

PU throughput (LPUT) constraint to effectively protect the reactive PU
transmission. We derive the structure of the optimal OSA policy under the LPUT

cosmological simulations of structure formation based on the cold dark matter

transonic solutions: outflows from the central region and from distant region
with a finite radius, depending upon the density distribution of the system.
The system with sufficiently steep density gradient at the center is allowed to
have the transonic outflows from the center. The resultant criterion
intriguingly indicates that the density gradient at the center must be steeper
than that of the prediction of conventional CDM model including Navarro, Frenk
& White (1997) and Moore et al. (1999). This result suggests that an additional
steeper density distribution originated by baryonic systems such as the stellar
component and/or the central massive black hole is required to realize
transonic outflow from the central region. On the other hand, we predict the
outflow, which is started at the outskirts of the galactic center and is
slowly-accelerated without any drastic energy injection like starburst events.
These transonic outflows may contribute secularly to the metal enrichment of

the value of the real box diagram function. With already precise experimental
values of epsilon_K, Delta M_d, Delta M_s, CP-asymmetry S_{psi K_S} and of
hat{B}_K entering the evaluation of epsilon_K, the future of CMFV in the Delta
F=2 sector depends crucially on the values of |Vcb|, |Vub|, gamma, F_{B_s}
sqrt{hat B_{B_s}} and F_{B_d} sqrt{hat B_{B_d}}. The ratio xi of the latter two
parameters, rather precisely determined from lattice calculations, allows then
together with Delta M_s/Delta M_d and S_{psi K_S} to determine the range of
gamma in the unitarity triangle independently of the value of S(v). Imposing in
addition the constraints from epsilon_K and Delta M_d allows to determine the
favorite CMFV values of |Vcb|, |Vub|, F_{B_s} sqrt{hat B_{B_s}} and F_{B_d}
sqrt{hat B_{B_d}} as functions of S(v) and gamma. The |Vcb|^4 dependence of
epsilon_K allows to determine |Vcb| for a given S(v) and gamma with a higher
precision than it is presently possible using tree-level decays. The same
applies to |Vub|, |Vtd| and |Vts| that are automatically determined as
functions of S(v) and gamma. Typically F_{B_s}sqrt{hat B_{B_s}} and F_{B_d}
sqrt{hat B_{B_d}} have to be significantly lower than their present lattice
values, while |Vcb| has to be significantly higher than its tree-level
determination. The region in the space of these three parameters allowed by
CMFV indicates visible problems in this class of models and hints for the
presence of new sources of flavour violation and/or new local operators in
Delta F=2 data that are strongly suppressed in these models. As a byproduct we
propose to reduce the present uncertainty in the charm contribution toepsilon_K
by using the experimental value of Delta M_K.

power hypergraphs, while sunflowers are a subclass of cored hypergraphs, but

even-uniform sunflowers. Moreover, we show that the largest Laplacian

Jupiter in the Kepler light curve, and its reality was confirmed by orbital
solutions based on follow-up spectroscopy. The companion Kepler-76b was
identified by the BEER algorithm, which detected the BEaming (sometimes called
Doppler boosting) effect together with the Ellipsoidal and Reflection/emission
modulations (BEER), at an orbital period of 1.54 days, suggesting a planetary
companion orbiting the 13.3 mag F star. Further investigation revealed that
this star appeared in the Kepler eclipsing binary catalog with estimated
primary and secondary eclipse depths of 5e-3 and 1e-4 respectively.
Spectroscopic radial-velocity follow-up observations with TRES and SOPHIE
confirmed Kepler-76b as a transiting 2.0+/-0.26 Mjup hot Jupiter. The mass of a
transiting planet can be estimated from either the beaming or the ellipsoidal
amplitude. The ellipsoidal-based mass estimate of Kepler-76b is consistent with
the spectroscopically measured mass while the beaming-based estimate is
significantly inflated. We explain this apparent discrepancy as evidence for
the superrotation phenomenon, which involves eastward displacement of the
hottest atmospheric spot of a tidally-locked planet by an equatorial
super-rotating jet stream. This phenomenon was previously observed only for HD
189733b in the infrared. We show that a phase shift of 10.3+/-2.0 degrees of
the planet reflection/emission modulation, due to superrotation, explains the
apparently inflated beaming modulation, resolving the ellipsoidal/beaming
amplitude discrepancy. Kepler-76b is one of very few confirmed planets in the
Kepler light curves that show BEER modulations and the first to show
superrotation evidence in the Kepler band. Its discovery illustrates for the
first time the ability of the BEER algorithm to detect short-period planets and
brown dwarfs.

eruption. STEREO/EUVI disk observations reveal a two ribbon flare underneath
the south-eastern part of the filament that is most probably occurred due to
reconnection process in the coronal magnetic field in the wake of the filament
eruption. The whipping like filament eruption later gives a slow CME in which
the leading edge and the core propagate respectively with the average speed of
$\approx$ 540 km s$^{-1}$ and $\approx$ 126 km s$^{-1}$ as observed in the
LASCO C2 coronagraph. The CME core formed by the eruptive flux-rope shows the
outer coronal downflows with the average speed of $\approx$ 56 km s$^{-1}$
after reaching up to $\approx$4.33 $R_{\sun}$. Initially, the core decelerates
with $\approx$ 48 m s$^{-2}$. The plasma first decelerates gradually up to the
height of $\approx$4.33 $ R_{\sun}$ and then starts accelerating downward. We
suggest a self-consistent model of a magnetic flux rope representing the
magnetic structure of the CME core formed by eruptive filament that lost its
previous stable equilibrium when reach at a critical height. With some
reasonable parameters, and inherent physical conditions the model describes the
non-radial ascending motion of the flux rope in the corona, its stopping at

mean field approximation based on Landau expansion. The random field is drawn
from the trimodal probability distribution $P(h_{i})=p \delta(h_{i}-h_{0}) + q
\delta (h_{i}+h_{0}) + r \delta(h_{i})$, where the probabilities $p, q, r$ take
on values within the interval $[0,1]$ consistent with the constraint $p+q+r=1$
(asymmetric distribution), $h_{i}$ is the random field variable and $h_{0}$ the
respective strength. This probability distribution is an extension of the
bimodal one allowing for the existence in the lattice of non magnetic particles
or vacant sites. The current random field Ising system displays second order
phase transitions, which, for some values of $p, q$ and $h_{0}$, are followed
by first order phase transitions, thus confirming the existence of a
tricritical point and in some cases two tricritical points. Also, reentrance
can be seen for appropriate ranges of the aforementioned variables. Using the
variational principle, we determine the equilibrium equation for magnetization,
solve it for both transitions and at the tricritical point in order to
determine the magnetization profile with respect to $h_{0}$.

show that the presence of a paraphoton field can alter the resonant frequencies

and uses measurements of a cavities resonant frequency to constrain the

rigid body in a J2 gravity field. The linear and nonlinear stability of the
classical type of relative equilibria of the rigid body, which have been
obtained in our previous paper, are studied in the framework of geometric
mechanics with the second-order gravitational potential. Non-canonical
Hamiltonian structure of the problem, i.e., Poisson tensor, Casimir functions
and equations of motion, are obtained through a Poisson reduction process by
means of the symmetry of the problem. The linear system matrix at the relative
equilibria is given through the multiplication of the Poisson tensor and
Hessian matrix of the variational Lagrangian. Based on the characteristic
equation of the linear system matrix, the conditions of linear stability of the
relative equilibria are obtained. The conditions of nonlinear stability of the
relative equilibria are derived with the energy-Casimir method through the
projected Hessian matrix of the variational Lagrangian. With the stability
conditions obtained, both the linear and nonlinear stability of the relative
equilibria are investigated in details in a wide range of the parameters of the
gravity field and the rigid body. We find that both the zonal harmonic J2 and
the characteristic dimension of the rigid body have significant effects on the
linear and nonlinear stability. Similar to the classical attitude stability in
a central gravity field, the linear stability region is also consisted of two
regions that are analogues of the Lagrange region and the DeBra-Delp region
respectively. The nonlinear stability region is the subset of the linear
stability region in the first quadrant that is the analogue of the Lagrange
region. Our results are very useful for the studies on the motion of natural

simply related to the number of particle types in the universal spectrum. This
was originally predicted in publications involving two of the current authors
for two-dimensional quantum field theories. Away from the universal region our
numerics suggest an entropic behaviour following quite closely the quantum
field theory prediction, except for extra dependencies on the correlation
length.

the geometry is not homogeneous. We first illustrate a procedure, based on heat
kernels, useful to deal with situations where the dual and chiral condensates

rapidly varying functions in space. Then we discuss a different approach based

robots assisting in Search and Rescue (SAR) is considered. In recent years, the
development of robots assisting in disaster mitigation in urban environments
has been actively encouraged, since robots can be deployed in dangerous and
hazardous areas where human SAR operations would not be possible.
  In order to meet the reliability requirements in SAR, the specifications of
the robots are stated in Linear Temporal Logic and synthesized into finite
state machines that can be executed as controllers. The resulting controllers
are purely discrete and maintain an ongoing interaction with their environment
by changing their internal state according to the inputs they receive from
sensors or other robots.
  Since SAR robots have to cooperate in order to complete the required tasks,
the synthesis of controllers that together achieve a common goal is considered.
This distributed synthesis problem is provably undecidable, hence it cannot be
solved in full generality, but a set of design principles is introduced in
order to develop specialized synthesizable specifications. In particular,
communication and cooperation are resolved by introducing a verified
standardized communication protocol and preempting negotiations between robots.
  The robots move on a graph on which we consider the search for stationary and
moving targets. Searching for moving targets is cast into a game of cops and
robbers, and specifications implementing a winning strategy are developed so
that the number of robots required is minimized.
  The viability of the methods is demonstrated by synthesizing controllers for
robots performing search and rescue for stationary targets and searching for
moving targets. It is shown that the controllers are guaranteed to achieve the
common goal of finding and rescuing the targets.

describes recent developments in two areas and show how these are connected
within the context of the conformally Hubble-normalized state space approach.
The first area is oscillatory singularities in spatially homogeneous cosmology
and the connection between asymptotic behaviour and heteroclinic chains. The
second area concerns oscillatory singularities in inhomogeneous models,
especially spike chains and recurring spikes. The review also outlines some
underlying reasons for why the structures that are the foundation for generic
oscillatory behaviour exists at all, which entails discussing how underlying
physical principles and applications of solution generating techniques yield
hierarchical structures and connections between them. Finally, it is pointed
out that recent progress concerning generic singularities motivates some
speculations that suggest that a paradigm shift concerning their physical role,
and what mathematical issues to address, might be in order.

approximating unweighted semi-matchings. A semi-matching in a bipartite graph G
= (A, B, E), with n = |A|, is a subset of edges S that matches all A vertices
to B vertices with the goal usually being to do this as fairly as possible.
While the term 'semi-matching' was coined in 2003 by Harvey et al. [WADS 2003],
the problem had already previously been studied in the scheduling literature
under different names.
  We present a deterministic one-pass streaming algorithm that for any 0 <=
\epsilon <= 1 uses space O(n^{1+\epsilon}) and computes an
O(n^{(1-\epsilon)/2})-approximation to the semi-matching problem. Furthermore,
with O(log n) passes it is possible to compute an O(log n)-approximation with
space O(n).
  In the one-way two-party communication setting, we show that for every
\epsilon > 0, deterministic communication protocols for computing an
O(n^{1/((1+\epsilon)c + 1)})-approximation require a message of size more than
cn bits. We present two deterministic protocols communicating n and 2n edges
that compute an O(sqrt(n)) and an O(n^{1/3})-approximation respectively.
  Finally, we improve on results of Harvey et al. [Journal of Algorithms 2006]
and prove new links between semi-matchings and matchings. While it was known
that an optimal semi-matching contains a maximum matching, we show that there
is a hierarchical decomposition of an optimal semi-matching into maximum
matchings. A similar result holds for semi-matchings that do not admit
length-two degree-minimizing paths.

four others look for solutions that provide the best agreement with
independently observed focal mechanisms. Tests on synthetic catalogs allow us
to qualify the performance of the fitting method and of the various validation
procedures. The ACLUD method is able to provide solutions that are close to the
expected ones, especially for the BIC and focal mechanismbased techniques. The
clustering method complemented by the validation step based on focal mechanisms
provides good solutions even in the presence of a significant spatial

systematic studies, if one considers that the actual binary fraction is
potentially larger owing to low-luminosity companions and that the sample
excluded obvious spectroscopic binaries. The location of the fastest rotators
in the H-R diagram indicates that these could be several Myr old. The offset in
the position of these fast rotators compared with the other stars confirms the
predictions of evolutionary models that fast-rotating stars tend to evolve more
vertically in the H-R diagram. Only one star of luminosity-class Vz, expected
to best characterize extreme youth, is located on the ZAMS, the other two stars
are more evolved. The distribution of nitrogen abundance of O and B stars
suggests that the mechanisms responsible for the chemical enrichment of slowly
rotating massive stars depends only weakly on the star's mass. We confirm that
the group of slowly rotating N-rich stars is not reproduced by the evolutionary
tracks. Our results call for stronger mixing in the models to explain the range
of observed N abundances. All stars have an N/C ratio as a function of stellar
luminosity that matches the predictions of the stellar evolution models well.
More massive stars have a higher N/C ratio than the less massive stars. Faster
rotators show on average a higher N/C ratio than slower rotators. The N/O
versus N/C ratios agree qualitatively well with those of stellar evolution
models. The only discrepant behavior is observed for the youngest two stars of
the sample, which both show very strong signs of mixing, which is unexpected

ionization degree and is located at a galactocentric distance of 12.4 $\pm$ 0.7
kpc. Therefore, NGC 2579 is an excellent probe for studying the behaviour of
the gas phase radial abundance gradients in the outer disc of the Milky Way. We
derive the physical conditions of the nebula using several emission
line-intensity ratios as well as the abundances of several ionic species from
the intensity of collisionally excited lines. We also determine the ionic
abundances of C$^{2+}$, O$^+$ and O$^{2+}$ -- and therefore the total O
abundance -- from faint pure recombination lines. The results for NGC 2579
permit to extend our previous determinations of the C, O and C/O gas phase
radial gradients of the inner Galactic disc (Esteban etal. 2005) to larger
galactocentric distances. We find that the chemical composition of NGC 2579 is
consistent with flatten gradients at its galactocentric distance. In addition,
we have built a tailored chemical evolution model that reproduces the observed
radial abundance gradients of O, C and N and other observational constraints.
We find that a levelling out of the star formation efficiency about and beyond
the isophotal radius can explain the flattening of chemical gradients observed
in the outer Galactic disc.

The galaxies were strictly selected so that only typical medium-size elliptical

to minimize point-to-point data scatter and avoid systematic biases. Data from
six different techniques of extracting the galactic dark matter content were
used to avoid methodological biases. A thorough investigation of the
interrelation between attributes of elliptical galaxies was carried out to
assess whether the correlation originates from an observational bias, but no
such origin could be identified. At face value, the correlation found implies
that at equal luminosities, rounder medium-size elliptical galaxies appear to
contain less dark matter than flatter elliptical galaxies, e.g. the rounder
galaxies are on average four times less massive than the flatter ones. This is
puzzling in the context of the conventional model of cosmological structure
formation.

the output state reduces to zero, however the quantum discord remains non-zero
for all noise values. Hence even in the presence of strong phase noise
non-classical correlations persist between the spin and path of the neutron
beam. This indicates that measurements performed on the spin of the neutron
beam will induce a disturbance on the path state. We calculate the effect of
the spin measurement by observing the changes in the observed contrast of the
interferometer for an output beam post-selected on a given spin state. In doing
so we demonstrate that these measurements allow us to implement a quantum
eraser, and a which-way measurement of the path taken by the neutron through
the interferometer. While strong phase noise removes the quantum eraser, the
spin-filtered which-way measurement is robust to phase noise. We experimentally
demonstrate this disturbance by comparing the contrasts of the output beam with
and without spin measurements of three neutron interferometers with varying
noise strengths. This demonstrates that even in the presence of noise that
suppresses path coherence and spin-path entanglement, a neutron interferometer
still exhibits uniquely quantum behaviour.

inertial frames (Lense-Thirring (LT) precession) in a general stationary

Kerr-Taub-NUT and Taub-NUT spacetimes are explicitly derived. Remarkably, in
the case of the zero angular momentum Taub-NUT spacetime, the frame-dragging
effect is shown {\it not} to vanish, when considered for spinning test

nearly-degenerate, opposite-parity excited states in atomic dysprosium (Dy).
Theoretical calculations predict that these states are very sensitive to
variation of the fine-structure constant, $\alpha$, owing to large relativistic
corrections of opposite sign for the opposite-parity levels. The near
degeneracy reduces the relative precision necessary to place constraints on
variation of $\alpha$ competitive with results obtained from the best atomic
clocks in the world. Additionally, the existence of several abundant isotopes
of Dy allows isotopic comparisons that suppress common-mode systematic errors.
The frequencies of the 754-MHz transition in $^{164}$Dy and 235-MHz transition
in $^{162}$Dy were measured over the span of two years. Linear variation of
$\alpha$ is found to be $\dot{\alpha}/\alpha = (-5.8\pm6.9)\times10^{-17}$
yr$^{-1}$, consistent with zero. The same data are used to constrain the
dimensionless parameter $k_\alpha$, characterizing a possible coupling of
$\alpha$ to a changing gravitational potential. We find that $k_\alpha =
(-5.5\pm5.2)\times10^{-7}$, essentially consistent with zero and the best
constraint to date.

avoid the possible bias that may occur with a simple sum when an author has

the $g$-index and the total citation count for three subject areas using
several association measures.
  Our results indicate that that the association between the $j$-index and the

variation may be due to the proportion of citations to publications of the
researcher that are in the $h$-core. The $j$-index is {\em not} an $h$-index
variant, and as such is intended to complement rather than necessarily replace
the $h$-index and other bibliometric indicators, thus providing a more complete

connection formulation is that the (linearised) Euclidean action has a definite

effective range in the 1S0 channel of NN scattering must be incorporated in
order for one to obtain satisfactory convergence for chiral effective field
theory. Without the proposition of perturbative one-pion exchange, an effective
field theory with the spin-0, isospin-1 dibaryon is developed to account for
this fine-tuning, and is demonstrated up to O(Q) where the leading irreducible
two-pion exchange arises. The approach shown in the paper results in rapid
convergence of the 1S0 partial-wave amplitude.

theoretical techniques: the full potential-linearized augmented plane wave
(FP-LAPW) method and the linear combination of localized pseudo atomic orbital
(LCPAO). The new modified Becke-Johnson (mBJ) exchange potential is chosen to
improve the bandgap of the superlattice and effective masses. The bandgap is
found to be slightly indirect and reduced from those of pure GaN and ZnO. The
origin of this reduction is attributed to the $p-d$ repulsion of the Zn-N
interface and the presence of the O $p$ electron. The electron effective mass
is found to be isotropic. Good agreement is obtained between two used methods

fingerprint templates (which are mostly based on the fuzzy vault scheme by
Juels and Sudan in 2002) with respect to the security they provide. We show
that attacks taking advantage of the system's false acceptance rate, i.e.
false-accept attacks, pose a very serious risk --- even if brute-force attacks
are impractical to perform. Our observations lead to the clear conclusion that
currently a single fingerprint is not sufficient to provide a secure biometric
cryptosystem. But there remain other problems that can not be resolved by
merely switching to multi-finger: Kholmatov and Yanikoglu in 2007 demonstrated
that it is possible to break two matching vault records at quite a high rate
via the correlation attack.
  We propose an implementation of a minutiae fuzzy vault that is inherently
resistant against cross-matching and the correlation attack. Surprisingly,
achieving cross-matching resistance is not at the cost of authentication
performance. In particular, we propose to use a randomized decoding procedure
and find that it is possible to achieve a GAR=91% at which no false accepts are
observed on a database generally used. Our ideas can be adopted into an
implementation of a multibiometric cryptosystem. All experiments described in

rotational lines ranging from J=14-13 up to J=40-39. [O I] is detected in all

rotationally supported disc with an outer radius of at least 100 au.
Measurements of the integrated flux at 870 microns suggest a disc mass that is
too low for gravitational instability to govern angular momentum transport.
However, if parts of the disc are optically thick at sub-mm wavelengths, the
sub-mm fluxes will underestimate the disc mass, and the disc's actual mass may
be substantially larger, potentially sufficient to be self-gravitating.
  We investigate this possibility using simple self-gravitating disc models. To
match the observed mass accretion rates requires a disc-to-star mass ratio of
at least ~0.5, which produces sub-mm fluxes that are similar to those observed
for L1527 IRS in the absence of irradiation from the envelope or central star.
If irradiation is significant, then the predicted fluxes exceed the observed
fluxes by around an order of magnitude. Our model also indicates that the
stresses produced by the gravitational instability are low enough to prevent
disc fragmentation.
  As such, we conclude that observations do not rule out the possibility that
the disc around L1527 IRS is self-gravitating, but it is more likely that
despite being a very young system, this disc may already have left the
self-gravitating phase.

sequence of positive integers in non-increasing order with sum $n$. Let
$\Omega:=\{1,...,n\}$. An ordered partition $P=(A_1,A_2,...)$ of $\Omega$ has
\emph{type} $\lambda$ if $|A_i|=\lambda_i$.
  Following Martin and Sagan, we say that $G$ is \emph{$\lambda$-transitive}
if, for any two ordered partitions $P=(A_1,A_2,...)$ and $Q=(B_1,B_2,...)$ of
$\Omega$ of type $\lambda$, there exists $g\in G$ with $A_ig=B_i$ for all $i$.
A group $G$ is said to be \emph{$\lambda$-homogeneous} if, given two ordered
partitions $P$ and $Q$ as above, inducing the sets $P'=\{A_1,A_2,...\}$ and
$Q'=\{B_1,B_2,...\}$, there exists $g\in G$ such that $P'g=Q'$. Clearly a
$\lambda$-transitive group is $\lambda$-homogeneous.
  The first goal of this paper is to classify the $\lambda$-homogeneous groups.
The second goal is to apply this classification to a problem in semigroup
theory.
  Let $\trans$ and $\sym$ denote the transformation monoid and the symmetric
group on $\Omega$, respectively. Fix a group $H\leq \sym$. Given a
non-invertible transformation $a\in \trans\setminus \sym$ and a group $G\leq
\sym$, we say that $(a,G)$ is an \emph{$H$-pair} if the semigroups generated by
$\{a\}\cup H$ and $\{a\}\cup G$ contain the same non-units, that is, $<
a,G>\setminus G=< a,H>\setminus H$. Using the classification of the
$\lambda$-homogeneous groups we classify all the $\sym$-pairs.
  This topic involves both group theory and semigroup theory; we have attempted
to include enough exposition to make the paper self-contained for researchers
in both areas.
  The paper finishes with a number of open problems on permutation and linear
groups.

(compartment-based) and microscopic (molecular-based) stochastic
reaction-diffusion simulations are investigated. Two of the three methods that
will be discussed in detail have been previously reported in the literature;
the two-regime method (TRM) and the compartment-placement method (CPM). The
third method that is introduced and analysed in this paper is the ghost cell
method (GCM). Presented is a comparison of sources of error. The convergent
properties of this error are studied as the time step $\Delta t$ (for updating
the molecular-based part of the model) approaches zero. It is found that the
error behaviour depends on another fundamental computational parameter $h$, the
compartment size in the mesoscopic part of the model. Two important limiting
cases, which appear in applications, are considered: (i) \Delta t approaches 0
and h is fixed; and (ii) \Delta t approaches 0 and h approaches 0 such that
\Delta t/h^2 is fixed. The error for previously developed approaches (the TRM
and CPM) converges to zero only in the limiting case (ii), but not in case (i).
It is shown that the error of the GCM converges in the limiting case (i). Thus
the GCM is superior to previous coupling techniques if the mesoscopic
description is much coarser than the microscopic part of the model.

defined between the rest-frame continuum-windows 2240-2255 and 2665-2695 Ang.,
as the measure of the UV Fe II emission. We find a significant shift of the
W2400 distribution to higher values for quasars within LQGs, predominantly for
those LQGs with 1.1 <= <z_LQG> <= 1.5. There is a tentative indication that the
shift to higher values increases with the quasar i magnitude. We find evidence
that within LQGs the ultrastrong emitters with W2400 >= 45 Ang. (more
precisely, ultrastrong-plus with W2400 >= 44 Ang.) have preferred
nearest-neighbour separations of ~ 30-50 Mpc to the adjacent quasar of any
W2400 strength. No such effect is seen for the ultrastrong emitters that are
not in LQGs. The possibilities for increasing the strength of the Fe II
emission appear to be iron abundance, Ly-alpha fluorescence, and
microturbulence, and probably all of these operate. The dense environment of
the LQGs may have led to an increased rate of star formation and an enhanced
abundance of iron in the nuclei of galaxies. Similarly the dense environment
may have led to more active blackholes and increased Ly-alpha fluorescence. The
preferred nearest-neighbour separation for the stronger emitters would appear
to suggest a dynamical component, such as microturbulence. In one particular
LQG, the Huge-LQG (the largest structure known in the early universe), six of
the seven strongest emitters very obviously form three pairings within the

Our
main contribution is a new method called Bingham Procrustean Alignment (BPA) to
align models with the scene. BPA uses point correspondences between oriented
features to derive a probability distribution over possible model poses. The
orientation component of this distribution, conditioned on the position, is
shown to be a Bingham distribution. This result also applies to the classic
problem of least-squares alignment of point sets, when point features are
orientation-less, and gives a principled, probabilistic way to measure pose
uncertainty in the rigid alignment problem. Our detection system leverages BPA
to achieve more reliable object detections in clutter.

example, in online advertising, observations that have a user or an ad in

and simulation results demonstrate that not accounting for this kind of
dependence structure can result in confidence intervals that are too narrow,
leading to inaccurate hypothesis tests.
  We develop a framework for understanding how dependence affects uncertainty
in user-item experiments and evaluate how bootstrap methods that account for
differing levels of dependence perform in practice. We use three real datasets
describing user behaviors on Facebook - user responses to ads, search results,
and News Feed stories - to generate data for synthetic experiments in which
there is no effect of the treatment on average by design. We then estimate
empirical Type I error rates for each bootstrap method. Accounting for
dependence within a single type of unit (i.e., within-user dependence) is often
sufficient to get reasonable error rates. But when experiments have effects, as
one might expect in the field, accounting for multiple units with a multiway
bootstrap can be necessary to get close to the advertised Type I error rates.
This work provides guidance to practitioners evaluating large-scale
experiments, and highlights the importance of analysis of inferential methods

J=1-0 and other data from the literature to investigate the variation of the
molecular gas, atomic gas and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) properties
of M51 as a function of distance along the spiral structure on sub-kpc scales.
We find that for the CO J=3-2 and CO J=2-1 transitions there is a clear
difference between the variation of arm and inter-arm emission with
galactocentric radius, with the inter-arm emission relatively constant with
radius and the contrast between arm and inter-arm emission decreasing with
radius. For CO J=1-0 and HI the variation with radius shows a similar trend for
the arm and inter-arm regions, and the arm-inter-arm contrast appears
relatively constant with radius. We investigate the variation of CO line ratios
(J=3-2/2-1, J=2-1/1-0 and J=3-2/1-0) as a function of distance along the spiral
structure. Line ratios are consistent with the range of typical values for
other nearby galaxies in the literature. The highest CO J=3-2/2-1 line ratios
are found in the central ~1 kpc and in the spiral arms and the lowest line
ratios in the inter-arm regions.We find no clear evidence of a trend with
radius for the spiral arms but for the inter-arm regions there appears to be a
trend for all CO line ratios to increase with radius. We find a strong
relationship between the ratio of CO J=3-2 intensity to stellar

different forms of Bell inequalities under the assumption of individual or

(S12) support the Dark Star (DS) scenario and even remove some potential
obstacles. Our previous work illustrated that the initial hydrogen densities of
the first equilibrium DSs are high, ~10^{17}/cm^3 for the case of 100 GeV
WIMPs, with a stellar radius of ~2-3 AU. Subsequent authors have somehow missed
the fact that equilibrium DSs have the high densities they do. S12 have
numerically simulated the effect of dark matter annihilation on the contraction
of a protostellar gas cloud en route to forming the first stars. They show
results at a density ~5 10^{14}/cm^3, slightly higher than the value at which
annihilation heating prevails over cooling. However, they are apparently unable
to reach the ~10^{17}/cm^3 density of our hydrostatic DS solutions. We are in
complete agreement with their physical result that the gas keeps collapsing to
densities > 5 10^{14}/cm^3, as it must before equilibrium DSs can form. However
we are in disagreement with some of the words in their paper which imply that
DSs never come to exist. It seems to us that S12 supports the DS scenario. They
use the sink particle approach to treat the gas that collapses to scales
smaller than their resolution limit. We argue that their sink is effectively a
DS, or contains one. An accretion disk forms as more mass falls onto the sink,
and the DS grows. S12 not only confirm our predictions about DS in the range
where the simulations apply, but also solve a potential obstruction to DS
formation by showing that dark matter annihilation prevents the fragmentation
of the collapsing gas. Whereas fragmentation might perturb the dark matter away
from the DS and remove its power source, instead S12 show that further sinks,
if any, form only far enough away as to leave the DS undisturbed in the comfort
of its dark matter surroundings.

risks in individuals based on genetic markers, which allows for identifying
individuals at high disease risks, and facilitating their disease treatment and
prevention. Although hundreds of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have
been conducted on many complex human traits in recent years, there has been
only limited success in translating these GWAS data into clinically useful risk
prediction models. The predictive capability of GWAS data is largely
bottlenecked by the available training sample size due to the presence of
numerous variants carrying only small to modest effects. Recent studies have
shown that different human traits may share common genetic bases. Therefore, an
attractive strategy to increase the training sample size and hence improve the
prediction accuracy is to integrate data of genetically correlated phenotypes.
Yet the utility of genetic correlation in risk prediction has not been explored
in the literature. In this paper, we analyzed GWAS data for bipolar and related
disorders (BARD) and schizophrenia (SZ) with a bivariate ridge regression
method, and found that jointly predicting the two phenotypes could
substantially increase prediction accuracy as measured by the AUC (area under
the receiver operating characteristic curve). We also found similar prediction
accuracy improvements when we jointly analyzed GWAS data for Crohn's disease
(CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The empirical observations were substantiated
through our comprehensive simulation studies, suggesting that a gain in
prediction accuracy can be obtained by combining phenotypes with relatively
high genetic correlations. Through both real data and simulation studies, we
demonstrated pleiotropy as a valuable asset that opens up a new opportunity to
improve genetic risk prediction in the future.

the release of chemical energy results in thermal expansion of the matter

superconductors, focusing on their normal state. Point contact spectroscopy is
generally used to study superconductors via Andreev reflection, but in recent
years it has also proved to be a useful bulk probe of strongly correlated
electron systems. Point contact spectroscopy picks up a conductance enhancement
in the normal state, above the structural phase transition, of certain iron
based compounds. These include Co doped $\rm{BaFe_2As_2}$, $\rm{SrFe_2As_2}$,
$\rm{Fe_{1+y}Te}$ and F doped $\rm{SmFeAsO}$ and $\rm{LaFeAsO}$. Two materials
which do not show this conductance enhancement are $\rm{CaFe_2As_2}$ and K
doped $\rm{BaFe_2As_2}$. This conductance enhancement is thought to be tied to
orbital fluctuations. Orbital fluctuations in the normal state of these
compounds increases the single particle density of states at the Fermi level,
indicating that PCS is sensitive to this excess density of states. The
enhancement is only observed at those temperatures and dopings where an
in-plane resisitve anisotropy in the detwinned compounds is known to occur.
Thus point contact spectroscopy provides strong indications of electronic
nematicity in such materials. We also present diagnostics on how to judge if a
junction is impacted by joule heating or not. We conclude with the outstanding
challenges in the field and the new experiments that need to be carried out.

networked agents. Following the model in [Kleinberg and Raghavan 2005], the
agents are represented as nodes in an infinite tree, which is generated by a
random branching process. A query is issued by the root, and each node
possesses an answer with an independent probability $p=1/n$. Further, each node
in the tree acts strategically to maximize its own payoff. In order to
encourage the agents to participate in the information acquisition process, an
incentive mechanism is needed to reward agents who provide the information as
well as agents who help to facilitate such acquisition.
  We focus on designing efficient sybil-proof incentive mechanisms, i.e., which
are robust to fake identity attacks. %We consider incentive mechanisms which
are sybil-proof, i.e., robust to fake identity attacks. We propose a family of
mechanisms, called the direct referral (DR) mechanisms, which allocate most
reward to the information holder as well as its direct parent (or direct
referral). We show that, when designed properly, the direct referral mechanism
is sybil-proof and efficient. In particular, we show that we may achieve an
expected cost of $O(h^2)$ for propagating the query down $h$ levels for any
branching factor $b>1$. This result exponentially improves on previous work
when requiring to find an answer with high probability. When the underlying
network is a deterministic chain, our mechanism is optimal under some mild
assumptions. In addition, due to its simple reward structure, the DR mechanism
might have good chance to be adopted in practice.

flavor symmetry breaking effects may be particularly small since the final
state interactions should be the same between the corresponding $B_d$ and $B_s$
decays due to the charge conjugation symmetry of the final states. This is
consistent with the newly measured direct CP asymmetry of $B_s \to \pi^+ K^-$.
These decays are thus supposed to be important in testing the Standard Model
and in probing new physics effects. However, the observation of pure
annihilation decay $B_s \to \pi^+ \pi^-$ appears to imply a large annihilation
scenario with $\rho_A \sim 3$, in contrast to the case of $\rho_A \sim 1$ in
$B_{u,d}$ decays in the framework of QCD factorization. This seems to indicate
unexpectedly large flavor symmetry breaking effects between the annihilation
amplitudes of $B_s$ and $B_{u,d}$ decays. This apparent contradiction could be
resolved by noticing that there is a priori no reason to justify the common
practice of assuming the universality of annihilation parameters for different
Dirac structures of effective operators. We then argue that, for $B_{d,s} \to
\pi^\mp K^\pm$ decays, the flavor symmetry breaking effects of annihilation
amplitudes have all been included in the initial state decay constants and are
thus small. But the flavor symmetry breaking effects in $B_{d,s} \to K^{(\ast)}
K^{(\ast)}$ decays are likely to be much larger, as part of the annihilation
topologies of $B_s \to K K$ decay could be related to $B_s \to \pi^+ \pi^-$
decay. Therefore when new physics effects are searched for in these decay
channels, care must be taken to consider the potentially large flavor symmetry
breaking effects in more details.

LAEs compared to LBGs. However, using the observed relationship between UV
continuum and Lyman-alpha luminosity of LAEs, we show that both LAEs and LBGs
belong to the same parent galaxy population with narrow band techniques having
greater efficiency in picking up galaxies with low UV luminosity. We also show
that the lack of evidence for the presence of the one halo term in the observed
LAE angular correlation functions can be attributed to sub-Poisson distribution
of LAEs in dark matter halos as a result of their low halo occupations.

  detail",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Axisymmetric accretion disks in vicinity of a central compact body are
studied. For the simple models such as vertically isothermal disks as well as
adiabatic ones the exact solutions to the steady-state MHD
(magneto-hydrodynamic) system were found under the assumption that the radial
components of velocity and magnetic field are negligible. On the basis of the
exact solution one may conclude that vertically isothermal disks will be
totally isothermal. The exact solution for the case of adiabatic disk
corroborates the view that thin disk accretion must be highly non-adiabatic. An
intermediate approach, that is between the above-listed two, for the modeling
of thin accretion disks is developed. In the case of non-magnetic disk, this
approach enables to prove, with ease, that all solutions for the mid-plane
circular velocity are unstable provided the disk is non-viscous. Hence, this
approach enables to demonstrate that the pure hydrodynamic turbulence in
accretion disks is possible. It is interesting that a turbulent magnetic disk
tends to be Keplerian. This can easily be shown by assuming that the turbulent
gas tends to flow with minimal losses, i.e. to have the Euler number as small
as possible.

Unfortunately, due to its gradient descent nature, this algorithm is highly

propose a discriminant analysis based approach that addresses a common

such as cultural differentiation, political affiliation, and product adoption
is the tension between two forces: influence (the tendency of people to become
similar to others they interact with) and selection (the tendency to be
affected most by the behavior of others who are already similar). Influence
tends to promote homogeneity within a society, while selection frequently
causes fragmentation. When both forces act simultaneously, it becomes an
interesting question to analyze which societal outcomes should be expected.
  To study this issue more formally, we analyze a natural stylized model built
upon active lines of work in political opinion formation, cultural diversity,
and language evolution. We assume that the population is partitioned into
""types"" according to some traits (such as language spoken or political
affiliation). While all types of people interact with one another, only people
with sufficiently similar types can possibly influence one another. The
""similarity"" is captured by a graph on types in which individuals of the same
or adjacent types can influence one another. We achieve an essentially complete
characterization of (stable) equilibrium outcomes and prove convergence from
all starting states. We also consider generalizations of this model.

We start with discrete two-level models which depend on control parameters; in
this setting, time-dependent model hamiltonians are described by loops in
parameter space. Then, the gap structure at a given Fermi energy generates a
non-trivial topology on parameter space which then leads to possibly
non-trivial polarizations. More precisely, we show the polarization, as given
by the *King-Smith--Vanderbilt formula*, depends only on the homotopy class of
the loop; hence, a necessary condition for non-trivial piezo effects is that
the fundamental group of the gapped parameter space must not be trivial. The
use of the framework of non-commutative geometry implies our results extend to
systems with weak disorder. We then apply this analysis to the uniaxial strain
model for graphene which includes nearest-neighbor hopping and a stagger

method with a spectrally-accurate geometric model based on Radial Basis
Function (RBF) interpolation of the Lagrangian structures. Our specific
motivation is the modeling of platelets in hemodynamic flows, though we
anticipate that our method will be useful in other applications as well. The
efficacy of our new RBF-IB method is shown through a series of numerical
experiments. Specifically, we compare our method with the traditional IB method
in terms of convergence and accuracy, computational cost, maximum stable
time-step size and volume loss. We conclude that the RBF-IB method has
advantages over the traditional Immersed Boundary method, and is well-suited
for modeling of platelets in hemodynamic flows.

  Scheduling - Order Optimality of Linear Receivers","44 pages, 9 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Consider the problem of a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO)
Multiple-Access Channel (MAC) at the limit of large number of users. Clearly,
in practical scenarios, only a small subset of the users can be scheduled to
utilize the channel simultaneously. Thus, a problem of user selection arises.
However, since solutions which collect Channel State Information (CSI) from all
users and decide on the best subset to transmit in each slot do not scale when
the number of users is large, distributed algorithms for user selection are
advantageous.
  In this paper, we analyse a distributed user selection algorithm, which
selects a group of users to transmit without coordinating between users and
without all users sending CSI to the base station. This threshold-based
algorithm is analysed for both Zero-Forcing (ZF) and Minimum Mean Square Error
(MMSE) receivers, and its expected sum-rate in the limit of large number of
users is investigated. It is shown that for large number of users it achieves
the same scaling laws as the optimal centralized scheme.

explicit breaking of boost symmetry. We use a Drude model of a strange metal to
study the physical effects of the new transport coefficient. It can be measured
using electric fields with non-zero gradients, or via the heat production when
an external force is turned on. Scaling arguments fix the resistivity to be
linear in the temperature.

solar wind acceleration. Here we investigate the dissipation of standing Alfven
waves due to phase mixing at the presence of steady flow and sheared magnetic
field in the stratified atmosphere of solar spicules. The transition region
between chromosphere and corona has also been considered. The initial flow is
assumed to be directed along spicule axis, and the equilibrium magnetic field
is taken 2-dimensional and divergence-free. It is determined that in contrast
to propagating Alfven waves, standing Alfven waves dissipate in time rather
than in space. Density gradients and sheared magnetic fields can enhance
damping due to phase mixing. Damping times deduced from our numerical
calculations are in good agreement with spicule lifetimes. Since spicules are
short living and transient structures, such a fast dissipation mechanism is
needed to transport their energy to the corona.

role in Applied Mathematics, namely as a key concept for approximating NP-hard

cone of completely positive matrices of the same order are dual to each other
with respect to the standard scalar product on the space of symmetric matrices.
This paper establishes some new relations between orthogonal pairs of such
matrices lying on the boundary of either cone. As a consequence, we can
establish an improvement on the upper bound of the cp-rank of completely
positive matrices of general order, and a further improvement for such matrices
of order six.

the E-DUE is formally established with a version of Brouwer's fixed point
theorem in a properly defined Hilbert space. The existence proof requires the
effective delay operator to be continuous, a regularity condition also needed
to ensure the existence of DUE with fixed demand (Han et al., 2013c). Our proof
does not invoke the a priori upper bound of the departure rates (path flows).

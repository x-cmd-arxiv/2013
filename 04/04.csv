of astrophysical collisionless shocks in partly ionized plasma with the
presence of non-thermal components. A specific feature of fast strong
collisionless shocks is their ability to accelerate energetic particles that
can modify the shock upstream flow and form the shock precursors. We discuss
the effects of energetic particle acceleration and associated magnetic field
amplification and decay in the extended shock precursors on the line and
continuum multi-wavelength emission spectra of the shocks. Both Balmer-type and
radiative astrophysical shocks are discussed in connection to supernova
remnants interacting with partially neutral clouds. Quantitative models
described in the review predict a number of observable line-like emission
features that can be used to reveal the physical state of the matter in the
shock precursors and the character of nonthermal processes in the shocks.
Implications of recent progress of gamma-ray observations of supernova remnants
in molecular clouds are highlighted.

The stationary part of the device (the stator) consists of three electrode
arrays arranged in the 'ABCABC' order. 'A', 'B', and 'C' carry time-independent
potentials and together form a spatially-periodic electrostatic profile. The
moving part of the device (the translator) has two electrode arrays 'ababab',
with 'a' and 'b' carrying time-dependent out-of-phase voltages. When the
frequency of the time-dependent voltage is close to the natural frequency of
the spring-mass system, the translator is driven into resonance. By adjusting
the spatial phase of the stationary profile, the driving force on the
translator can be maximized for any equilibrium position. Physical misalignment
between the stator and translator resulting from imperfect fabrication can be
corrected electrically. A dynamical equation describing translator motion is
derived and analyzed for resonant and parametric driving. In both cases, the
driving force depends on the translator displacement in a periodic fashion.
Such nonlinearity of the driving force results in self-stabilization of forced
oscillations. This property has implications for the stability of vibratory
gyroscopes.

Results: While almost all papers use corpora of some kind with the common case

we can detect recurrences. We discover several forms of requirements and

atmospheric parameters of the studied stars and their chemical abundances were
determined using high-resolution optical spectroscopy. We employed the
local-thermodynamic-equilibrium model atmospheres of Kurucz and the spectral
analysis code MOOG. The abundances of the light elements were derived using the
spectral synthesis technique. Results: We found that NGC 3114 has a mean
metallicity of [Fe/H] = -0.01+/-0.03. The isochrone fit yielded a turn-off mass
of 4.2 Msun. The [N/C] ratio is in good agreement with the models predicted by
first dredge-up. We found that two stars, HD 87479 and HD 304864, have high
rotational velocities of 15.0 km/s and 11.0 km/s; HD 87526 is a halo star and
is not a member of NGC 3114. Conclusions: The carbon and nitrogen abundance in
NGC 3114 agree with the field and cluster giants. The oxygen abundance in NGC
3114 is lower compared to the field giants. The [O/Fe] ratio is similar to the
giants in young clusters. We detected sodium enrichment in the analyzed cluster
giants. As far as the other elements are concerned, their [X/Fe] ratios follow
the same trend seen in giants with the same metallicity.

membrane adhered to a substrate by surface forces. The substrate is patterned
with etched microcavities of a prescribed volume and when they are covered with
the graphene monolayer it traps a fixed number (N) of gas molecules in the
microchamber. By lowering the ambient pressure, and thus changing the pressure
difference across the graphene membrane, the membrane can be made to bulge and
delaminate in a stable manner from the substrate. Here we describe the analysis
of the membrane/substrate as a thermodynamic system and explore the behavior of
the system over representative experimentally-accessible geometry and loading
parameters. We carry out companion experiments and compare them to the
theoretical predictions and then use the theory and experiments together to
determine the adhesion energy of graphene/SiO2 interfaces. We find an average
adhesion energy of 0.24 J/m2 which is lower, but in line with our previously
reported values. We assert that this test, which we call the constant N blister
test, is a valuable approach to determine the adhesion energy between
two-dimensional solid membranes and a substrate, which is an important, but not
well-understood aspect of behavior. The test also provides valuable information
that can serve as the basis for subsequent research to understand the
mechanisms contributing to the observed adhesion energy. Finally, we show how

for variants of a sparse greedy approximation procedure for concave
optimization known as {the Frank-Wolfe (FW) method}. In particular, this
procedure has been successfully applied to train large-scale instances of
non-linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Specializing FW to SVM training has
allowed to obtain efficient algorithms but also important theoretical results,
including convergence analysis of training algorithms and new characterizations
of model sparsity.
  In this paper, we present and analyze a novel variant of the FW method based
on a new way to perform away steps, a classic strategy used to accelerate the
convergence of the basic FW procedure. Our formulation and analysis is focused
on a general concave maximization problem on the simplex. However, the
specialization of our algorithm to quadratic forms is strongly related to some
classic methods in computational geometry, namely the Gilbert and MDM
algorithms.
  On the theoretical side, we demonstrate that the method matches the
guarantees in terms of convergence rate and number of iterations obtained by
using classic away steps. In particular, the method enjoys a linear rate of
convergence, a result that has been recently proved for MDM on quadratic forms.
  On the practical side, we provide experiments on several classification
datasets, and evaluate the results using statistical tests. Experiments show
that our method is faster than the FW method with classic away steps, and works
well even in the cases in which classic away steps slow down the algorithm.
Furthermore, these improvements are obtained without sacrificing the predictive
accuracy of the obtained SVM model.

description of 6D (2,0) superconformal theory. We start by clarifying some
issues related to the localization of N=1 SYM with matter on $S^5$. We
concentrate on the case of a single adjoint hypermultiplet with a mass term and
argue that the theory has a symmetry enlargement at mass M=1/(2r), where r is
the $S^5$ radius. However, in order to have a well-defined localization locus
it is necessary to rotate M onto the imaginary axis, breaking the enlarged
symmetry. Based on our prescription, the imaginary mass values are physical and
we show how the localized path integral is consistent with earlier results for
5D SYM in flat space. We then compute the free energy and the expectation value
for a circular Wilson loop in the large N limit. The Wilson loop calculation
shows a mass dependent constant rescaling between weak and strong coupling. The
Wilson loop continued back to to the enlarged symmetry point is consistent with
a supergravity computation for an M2 brane using the standard identification of
the compactification radius and the 5D coupling. If we continue back to the
physical regime and use this value of the mass to determine the
compactification radius, then we find agreement between the SYM free energy and
the corresponding supergravity calculation. We also verify numerically some of
our analytic approximations.

advances in machine learning techniques, more specifically in the field of
image processing and text processing, have shown that such divide and conquer
strategy (i.e., separating feature extraction and modeling steps) may not be
necessary. Motivated from these studies, in the framework of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs), this paper investigates a novel approach, where the
input to the ANN is raw speech signal and the output is phoneme class
conditional probability estimates. On TIMIT phoneme recognition task, we study
different ANN architectures to show the benefit of CNNs and compare the
proposed approach against conventional approach where, spectral-based feature
MFCC is extracted and modeled by a multilayer perceptron. Our studies show that
the proposed approach can yield comparable or better phoneme recognition
performance when compared to the conventional approach. It indicates that CNNs
can learn features relevant for phoneme classification automatically from the

predicted, on the basis of density-functional theory calculations at T=0, that
this tripled periodicity arises from the complete polarization of the electron
spin on every third silicon atom along the step; in the ground state these
linear chains of silicon spins are antiferromagnetically ordered. Here we
explore, using ab-initio molecular dynamics and kinetic Monte Carlo

the density of Makemake, but these results were, in part, derived from
qualitative arguments. We reanalyzed the occultation timing data using a
quantitative statistical description, and, in general, find the previously
reported results on the shape of Makemake to be unjustified. In our solution,
in which we use our inference from photometric data that Makemake is being
viewed nearly pole-on, we find a 1 sigma upper limit to the projected
elongation of Makemake of 1.02, with measured equatorial diameter of 1434 +/-
14 km and a projected polar diameter of 1422 +/- 14 km, yielding an albedo of
0.81+0.01/-0.02$. If we remove the external constraint on the pole position of
Makemake, we find instead a 1 sigma upper limit to the elongation of 1.06, with
a measured equatorial diameter of 1434+48/-18 km and a projected polar diameter

that the reported measurement of the density of Makemake was based on the
misapplication of the volatile retention models. A corrected analysis shows
that the occultation measurements provide no meaningful constraint on the

Galactic halo provide a unique present-day record of the nucleosynthesis
products of its earliest stars. While the heaviest elements were synthesized by
the r- and s-processes, dominant production mechanisms of light trans-ironic
elements were obscure until recently. This work investigates further our 2011
conclusion that the low-entropy regime of a high-entropy wind (HEW) produced
molybdenum and ruthenium in two moderately metal-poor turnoff stars that showed
extreme overabundances of those elements with respect to iron. Only a few, rare
nucleosynthesis events may have been involved.
  Here we determine abundances for Mo, Ru, and other trans-Fe elements for 28
similar stars by matching spectral calculations to well-exposed near-UV Keck
HIRES spectra obtained for beryllium abundances. In each of the 26 turnoff
stars with Mo or Ru line detections and no evidence for s-process production
(therefore old), we find Mo and Ru to be three to six times overabundant. In
contrast, the maximum overabundance is reduced to factors of three and two for
the neighboring elements zirconium and palladium. Since the overproduction
peaks sharply at Mo and Ru, a low-entropy HEW is confirmed as its origin.
  The overabundance level of the heavy r-process elements varies significantly,
from none to a factor of four, but is uncorrelated with Mo and Ru
overabundances. Despite their moderate metallicity, stars in this group trace
the products of different nucleosynthetic events: possibly very few events,
possibly events whose output depended on environment, metallicity, or time.

protection of deeper tissues. As such, the skin must maintain a homeostatic
balance in the face of many microenvironmental and genetic perturbations. At
its simplest, skin homeostasis is maintained by the balance between skin cell
growth and death such that skin architecture is preserved. This study presents
a hybrid multiscale mathematical model of normal skin (vSkin). The model
focuses on key cellular and microenvironmental variables that regulate
homeostatic interactions among keratinocytes, melanocytes and fibroblasts, key
components of the skin. The model recapitulates normal skin structure, and is
robust enough to withstand physical as well as biochemical perturbations.
Furthermore, the vSkin model revealed the important role of the skin
microenvironment in melanoma initiation and progression. Our experiments showed
that dermal fibroblasts, which are an important source of growth factors in the
skin, adopt a phenotype that facilitates cancer cell growth and invasion when
they become senescent. Based on these experimental results, we incorporated
senescent fibroblasts into vSkin model and showed that senescent fibroblasts
transform the skin microenvironment and enhance the growth and invasion of
normal melanocytes as well as early stage melanoma cells. These predictions are
consistent with our experimental results as well as clinical observations. Our
co-culture experiments show that the senescent fibroblasts promote the growth
and invasion of non-tumorigenic melanoma cells. We also observed increased
proteolytic activity in stromal fields adjacent to melanoma lesions in human
histology. Collectively, senescent fibroblasts create a pro-oncogenic
environment that synergizes with mutations to drive melanoma initiation and
progression and should therefore be considered as a potential future
therapeutic target.

techniques for studying phase transitions in discrete structures. Recently,
their ideas have been harnessed to obtain improved rigorous results on the
phase transitions in binary problems such as random $k$-SAT or $k$-NAESAT
(e.g., Coja-Oghlan and Panagiotou: STOC 2013). However, these rigorous
arguments, typically centered around the second moment method, do not extend
easily to problems where there are more than two possible values per variable.
The single most intensely studied example of such a problem is random graph
$k$-coloring. Here we develop a novel approach to the second moment method in
this problem. This new method, inspired by physics conjectures on the geometry
of the set of $k$-colorings, allows us to establish a substantially improved
lower bound on the $k$-colorability threshold. The new lower bound is within an
additive $2\ln 2+o_k(1)\approx 1.39$ of a simple first-moment upper bound and
within $2\ln 2-1+o_k(1)\approx 0.39$ of the physics conjecture. By comparison,

detectors and successive interference cancellation (SIC) detectors still
exhibit considerable performance gap to the optimal maximum likelihood detector

K-best algorithm was developed at the cost of the extra complexity on the order
$\mathcal{O}(N_t^2 K + N_t K^2)$, where $N_t$ is the number of transmit
antennas and $K$ is the number of candidates. In this paper, we develop an
LR-aided K-best algorithm with lower complexity by exploiting a priority queue.
With the aid of the priority queue, our analysis shows that the complexity of
the LR-aided K-best algorithm can be further reduced to $\mathcal{O}(N_t^2 K +
N_t K {\rm log}_2(K))$. The low complexity of the proposed LR-aided K-best

overhead costs, and may be subject to biases, inconsistencies, and oversights.
We investigate a class of funding models in which all participants receive an
equal portion of yearly funding, but are then required to anonymously donate a
fraction of their funding to peers. The funding thus flows from one participant
to the next, each acting as if he or she were a funding agency themselves. Here
we show through a simulation conducted over large-scale citation data (37M
articles, 770M citations) that such a distributed system for science may yield
funding patterns similar to existing NIH and NSF distributions, but may do so
at much lower overhead while exhibiting a range of other desirable features.
Self-correcting mechanisms in scientific peer evaluation can yield an efficient
and fair distribution of funding. The proposed model can be applied in many
situations in which top-down or bottom-up allocation of public resources is
either impractical or undesirable, e.g. public investments, distribution
chains, and shared resource management.

between ~25 and ~1000au. The data allowed us to infer stellar component masses
and ages and, from the detection of near-infrared excess emission and the
strength of Brackett-gamma emission, the presence of ongoing accretion and hot
circumstellar dust of the individual stellar component of each binary. Of all
the stellar components in close binaries with separations of 25-100au,
10(+15-5)% show signs of accretion. This is less than half of the accretor
fraction found in wider binaries, which itself appears significantly reduced
(~44%) compared with previous measurements of single stars in Cha I. Hot dust
was found around 50(+30-15)% of the target components, a value that is
indistinguishable from that of Cha I single stars. Only the closest binaries
(<25au) were inferred to have a significantly reduced fraction (<~25%) of
components that harbor hot dust. Accretors were exclusively found in binary
systems with unequal component masses M_secondary/M_primary < 0.8, implying
that the detected accelerated disk dispersal is a function of mass-ratio. This
agrees with the finding that only one accreting secondary star was found, which
is also the weakest accretor in the sample. The results imply that disk
dispersal is more accelerated the stronger the dynamical disk truncation, i.e.,
the smaller the inferred radius of the disk. (abridged)

formation history, chemical enrichment and morpho-kinematic structure.
Parameters behind these can be measured by combining photometric techniques
with modelling. However, there are uncertainties from the ambiguity of colour
and magnitude and the effects of interstellar reddening.
  Aims: In this paper we present a detailed reddening map of the central 30
Doradus region of the Large Magellanic Cloud; for community use and to test the
methods used. The reddening, a measurement of dust extinction, acts as a tracer
of the interstellar medium (ISM).
  Methods: Near infrared photometry of red clump stars are used to measure
reddening as extinction is the main cause of their colour and magnitude
variance. The star formation history is used to convert colour to reddening
values which are subsequently converted to visual extinction.
  Results: Presented is a dust map for the 30 Doradus field. This map samples a
region of 1x1.5 deg, containing ~1.5x10^5 red clump stars which probe reddening
up to AV=6 mag. We compare our map with maps from the literature, including
optical extinction maps and radio, mid- and far-infrared maps of atomic
hydrogen and dust emission. Through estimation of column density we locate
molecular clouds.
  Conclusions: This new reddening map shows correlation with equivalent maps in
the literature, validating the method of red clump star selection. We make our
reddening map available for community use. In terms of ISM the red clump stars
appear to be more affected by the cooler dust measured by 70 micron emission
because there is stronger correlation between increasing emission and
extinction due to red clump stars not being located near hot stars that would
heat the dust. The transition from atomic hydrogen to molecular hydrogen occurs
between densities of NH=4x10^21 to 6x10^21 cm^-2.

recent observations have suggested that the brightest SMGs are almost
exclusively multiple fainter sources blended into a single source in the
single-dish surveys. This result is in contrast with the predictions of our
previously presented theoretical model, which includes some effects of
blending. In this Letter, we consider the implications of an upper limit on the
submm flux density for the demographics of the SMG population. Using a relation
amongst submm flux, star formation rate (SFR), and dust mass (M_d) from our
previous work, we infer the maximum SFR for a range of flux density limits. For
M_d = 2 x 10^9 (5 x 10^8) M_sun, the SFR limit that corresponds to an
870-{\mu}m flux density (S_870) limit in the range 9 - 12.5 mJy is in the range
~630 - 1400 (3600 - 7700) M_sun/yr. The SFR limit implies a correspondingly
sharp, redshift-dependent cutoff in the stellar mass (M_star) function, the
value of which we predict using the S_870-M_star relation predicted by our
model. The M_star limit decreases with increasing redshift: for an S_870 limit
of 9 - 12.5 mJy, the M_star limit ranges from ~4 - 7 x 10^12 M_sun at z ~ 1 to
~3 - 5 x 10^11 M_sun at z ~ 6. We discuss the few interferometrically detected
SMGs that may be brighter than the proposed cutoff. Although such objects are
certainly interesting, inferences based on such objects may not apply to most
SMGs.

orbiting the giant planet HD 23079b, a Jupiter-mass planet, which follows a
low-eccentricity orbit in the outer region of HD 23079's habitable zone. We
show that HD 23079b is able to host habitable moons in prograde and retrograde
orbits, as expected, noting that the outer stability limit for retrograde
orbits is increased by nearly 90% compared to that of prograde orbits, a result
consistent with previous generalized studies. For the targeted parameter space
it was found that the outer stability limit for habitable moons varies between
0.05236 and 0.06955 AU (prograde orbits) and between 0.1023 and 0.1190 AU
(retrograde orbits) depending on the orbital parameters of the Jupiter-type
planet if a minimum mass is assumed. These intervals correspond to 0.306 and
0.345 (prograde orbits) and 0.583 and 0.611 (retrograde orbits) of the planet's
Hill radius. Larger stability limits are obtained if an increased value for the
planetary mass m_p is considered; they are consistent with the theoretically
deduced relationship of m_p^{1/3}. Finally, we compare our results to the
statistical formulae of Domingos et al. (2006) [MNRAS 373, 1227], indicating

gravitational and electromagnetic fields in the Kerr-Newman geometry, because
of the indissoluble coupling of the perturbation functions. Here we circumvent
this long-standing problem by working in the slow-rotation limit. We compute
the quasinormal modes up to linear order in J for any value of Q and provide
the first, fully-consistent stability analysis of the Kerr-Newman metric. For
scalar perturbations the quasinormal modes can be computed exactly, and we
demonstrate that the method is accurate within 3% for spins J/Jmax<~0.5, where
Jmax is the maximum allowed spin for any value of Q. Quite remarkably, we find
numerical evidence that the axial and polar sectors of the

listed as hosting a transiting planet-candidate by Borucki et al. and Batalha

occultation of a white dwarf as it passes behind the M dwarf. We combine
publicly-available long- and short-cadence Kepler light curves with
ground-based measurements to robustly determine the system parameters. The
occultation events are readily apparent in the Kepler light curve, as is
spin-orbit synchronization of the M dwarf, and we detect the transit of the
white dwarf in front of the M dwarf halfway between the occultation events. The
size of the white dwarf with respect to the Einstein ring during transit (REin
= 0.00473 +/- 0.00055 RSun) causes the transit depth to be shallower than
expected from pure geometry due to gravitational lensing. KOI-256 is an old,
long-period ePCEB and serves as a benchmark object for studying the evolution
of binary star systems as well as white dwarfs themselves, thanks largely to
the availability of near-continuous, ultra-precise Kepler photometry.

general covariant theory of the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity with the

$|\lambda - 1|$ characterizes the deviation of the theory from general
relativity in the infrared limit. The junction conditions across the surface of
a collapsing star are derived under the (minimal) assumption that the junctions
be mathematically meaningful in terms of distribution theory. When the
collapsing star is made of a homogeneous and isotropic perfect fluid, and the
external region is described by a stationary spacetime, the problem reduces to
the matching of six independent conditions. If the perfect fluid is
pressureless (a dust fluid), it is found that the matching is also possible. In
particular, in the case $\lambda = 1$, the external spacetime is described by
the Schwarzschild (anti-) de Sitter solution written in Painlev\'e-Gullstrand
coordinates. In the case $\lambda \not= 1$, the external spacetime is static
but not asymptotically flat. Our treatment can be easily generalized to other
versions of Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity or, more generally, to any theory of

luminosities a factor of ~100 brighter than normal SNe (typically SLSNe have
M_V <-21), has shown an unexpected diversity in core-collapse supernova
properties. Numerous models have been postulated for the nature of these
events, including a strong interaction of the shockwave with a dense
circumstellar environment, a re-energizing of the outflow via a central engine,
or an origin in the catastrophic destruction of the star following a loss of
pressure due to pair production in an extremely massive stellar core (so-called
pair instability supernovae). Here we consider constraints that can be placed
on the explosion mechanism of Hydrogen-poor SLSNe (SLSNe-I) via X-ray
observations, with XMM-Newton, Chandra and Swift, and show that at least one
SLSNe-I is likely the brightest X-ray supernovae ever observed, with L_X ~
10^45 ergs/s, ~150 days after its initial discovery. This is a luminosity 3
orders of magnitude higher than seen in other X-ray supernovae powered via
circumstellar interactions. Such high X-ray luminosities are sufficient to
ionize the ejecta and markedly reduce the optical depth, making it possible to
see deep into the ejecta and any source of emission that resides there.
Alternatively, an engine could have powered a moderately relativistic jet
external to the ejecta, similar to those seen in gamma-ray bursts. If the
detection of X-rays does require an engine it implies that these SNe do create
compact objects, and that the stars are not completely destroyed in a pair
instability event. Future observations will determine which, if any, of these
mechanisms are at play in superluminous supernovae.

artificially depressed by relaxation driven mass loss. The combination of our

been used in the visible and near-infrared regimes, while coronagraphic
applications in the mid-infrared remain nowadays largely unexplored. Vector
vortex phase masks based on concentric subwavelength gratings show great
promise for such applications. We aim at producing and validating the first
high-performance broadband focal plane phase mask coronagraphs for applications
in the mid-infrared regime, and in particular the L band with a fractional
bandwidth of ~16% (3.5-4.1 \mu m). Based on rigorous coupled wave analysis, we
designed an annular groove phase mask (AGPM) producing a vortex effect in the L
band, and etched it onto a series of diamond substrates. The grating parameters
were measured by means of scanning electron microscopy. The resulting
components were then tested on a mid-infrared coronagraphic test bench. A
broadband raw null depth of 2 x 10^{-3} was obtained for our best L-band AGPM
after only a few iterations between design and manufacturing. This corresponds
to a raw contrast of about 6 x 10^{-5} (10.5 mag) at 2\lambda/D. This result is
fully in line with our projections based on rigorous coupled wave analysis
modeling, using the measured grating parameters. The sensitivity to tilt and
focus has also been evaluated. After years of technological developments,
mid-infrared vector vortex coronagraphs finally become a reality and live up to
our expectations. Based on their measured performance, our L-band AGPMs are now
ready to open a new parameter space in exoplanet imaging at major ground-based

applications in many domains. The high computational cost of DML arises from
the large number of variables to be determined and the constraint that a
distance metric has to be a positive semi-definite (PSD) matrix. Although
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has been successfully applied to improve the
efficiency of DML, it can still be computationally expensive because in order
to ensure that the solution is a PSD matrix, it has to, at every iteration,
project the updated distance metric onto the PSD cone, an expensive operation.
We address this challenge by developing two strategies within SGD, i.e.
mini-batch and adaptive sampling, to effectively reduce the number of updates
(i.e., projections onto the PSD cone) in SGD. We also develop hybrid approaches
that combine the strength of adaptive sampling with that of mini-batch online
learning techniques to further improve the computational efficiency of SGD for
DML. We prove the theoretical guarantees for both adaptive sampling and
mini-batch based approaches for DML. We also conduct an extensive empirical
study to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for DML.

consequence is that the additional {\it constraint} of fixing the EW scale,

codes that are locally correctable (and hence locally decodable if linear) with
a sublinear number of queries, based on lifting codes with respect to functions
on the coordinates. Our approach generalizes the lifting of affine-invariant
codes of Guo, Kopparty, and Sudan and its generalization automorphic lifting,
suggested by Ben-Sasson et al, which lifts algebraic geometry codes with
respect to a group of automorphisms of the code. Our notion of lifting is a
natural alternative to the degree-lifting of Ben-Sasson et al and it carries
two advantages. First, it overcomes the rate barrier inherent in
degree-lifting. Second, it is extremely flexible, requiring no special
properties (e.g. linearity, invariance) of the base code, and requiring very
little structure on the set of functions on the coordinates of the code.
  As an application, we construct new explicit families of locally correctable
codes by lifting algebraic geometry codes. Like the multiplicity codes of
Kopparty, Saraf, Yekhanin and the affine-lifted codes of Guo, Kopparty, Sudan,
our codes of block-length $N$ can achieve $N^\epsilon$ query complexity and
$1-\alpha$ rate for any given $\epsilon, \alpha > 0$ while correcting a
constant fraction of errors, in contrast to the Reed-Muller codes and the
degree-lifted AG codes of Ben-Sasson et al which face a rate barrier of
$\epsilon^{O(1/\epsilon)}$. However, like the degree-lifted AG codes, our codes

the amplitude of the local-shape bispectrum is constrained to be fNL=-14+22-21.
This sensitivity implies that cluster counts could be used to distinguish
qualitatively different models for the primordial fluctuations that have
identical bispectra. (Abstract Abridged.)

  exists-equal problems",,,,,"cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we study the two player randomized communication complexity of
the sparse set disjointness and the exists-equal problems and give matching
lower and upper bounds (up to constant factors) for any number of rounds for
both of these problems. In the sparse set disjointness problem, each player
receives a k-subset of [m] and the goal is to determine whether the sets
intersect. For this problem, we give a protocol that communicates a total of
O(k\log^{(r)}k) bits over r rounds and errs with very small probability. Here
we can take r=\log^{*}k to obtain a O(k) total communication \log^{*}k-round
protocol with exponentially small error probability, improving on the O(k)-bits
O(\log k)-round constant error probability protocol of Hastad and Wigderson
from 1997.
  In the exist-equal problem, the players receive vectors x,y\in [t]^n and the
goal is to determine whether there exists a coordinate i such that x_i=y_i.
Namely, the exists-equal problem is the OR of n equality problems. Observe that
exists-equal is an instance of sparse set disjointness with k=n, hence the
protocol above applies here as well, giving an O(n\log^{(r)}n) upper bound. Our
main technical contribution in this paper is a matching lower bound: we show
that when t=\Omega(n), any r-round randomized protocol for the exists-equal
problem with error probability at most 1/3 should have a message of size
\Omega(n\log^{(r)}n). Our lower bound holds even for super-constant r <=
\log^*n, showing that any O(n) bits exists-equal protocol should have \log^*n -
O(1) rounds.

functions (PDFs) of the CO emission within the PAWS field, which covers the
inner 11 x 7 kpc of M51. We find variations in the shape of CO PDFs within
different M51 environments, and between M51 and M33 and the Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC). Globally, the PDFs for the inner disk of M51 can be represented by
narrow lognormal functions that cover 1 to 2 orders of magnitude in CO
brightness and integrated intensity. The PDFs for M33 and the LMC are narrower
and peak at lower CO intensities. However, the CO PDFs for different dynamical
environments within the PAWS field depart from the shape of the global
distribution. The PDFs for the interarm region are approximately lognormal, but
in the spiral arms and central region of M51, they exhibit diverse shapes with
a significant excess of bright CO emission. The observed environmental
dependence of the shape of the CO PDFs is qualitatively consistent with changes
that would be expected if molecular gas in the spiral arms has a larger range
of average densities, gas temperatures and velocity fluctuations, though
further work is required to disentangle the importance of large-scale dynamical
effects versus star formation feedback in regulating these properties. We show
that the shape of the CO PDFs for different M51 environments is only weakly
related to global properties of the CO emission, but is strongly correlated
with some properties of the local giant molecular cloud (GMC) and young stellar
cluster populations. For galaxies with strong spiral structure such as M51, our
results indicate that galactic-scale dynamical processes play a significant
role in the formation and evolution of GMCs and stellar clusters.(abridged)

distortion and magnification measurements of background galaxies, and combine
these signals to construct an optimally estimated radial mass profile of the

consistency between strong-lensing and weak-lensing in the region where these

reveals a clear filamentary structure traced by distinct mass halos. We model
the lensing shear field with 9 halos, including the main cluster, corresponding
to mass peaks detected above 2.5\sigma_\kappa. The total mass of the cluster as

making the footprint of the Si modulators small. Here, we have theoretically
and experimentally investigated the enhancement of the plasma dispersion effect
and free-carrier absorption by strain-induced mass modulation in
silicon-germanium (SiGe). The application of compressive strain to SiGe reduces
the conductivity hole mass, resulting in the enhanced free-carrier effects.
Thus, the strained SiGe-based optical modulator exhibits more than twice
modulation efficiency as large as that of the Si modulator. To the best of our
knowledge, it is the first demonstration of the enhanced free-carrier effects
in strained SiGe at the near-infrared telecommunication wavelength. The

critical step for improving object detection and tracking. The survey covers
methods published during the last decade, and places them in a feature-based
taxonomy comprised of four categories: chromacity, physical, geometry and
textures. A selection of prominent methods across the categories is compared in
terms of quantitative performance measures (shadow detection and discrimination
rates, colour desaturation) as well as qualitative observations. Furthermore,
we propose the use of tracking performance as an unbiased approach for
determining the practical usefulness of shadow detection methods. The
evaluation indicates that all shadow detection approaches make different
contributions and all have individual strength and weaknesses. Out of the
selected methods, the geometry-based technique has strict assumptions and is
not generalisable to various environments, but it is a straightforward choice
when the objects of interest are easy to model and their shadows have different
orientation. The chromacity based method is the fastest to implement and run,
but it is sensitive to noise and less effective in low saturated scenes. The
physical method improves upon the accuracy of the chromacity method by adapting
to local shadow models, but fails when the spectral properties of the objects
are similar to that of the background. The small-region texture based method is
especially robust for pixels whose neighbourhood is textured, but may take
longer to implement and is the most computationally expensive. The large-region
texture based method produces the most accurate results, but has a significant
computational load due to its multiple processing steps.

transformation of the ordering of its Groebner basis from DRL to LEX is a key
step in polynomial system solving and turns out to be the bottleneck of the
whole solving process. Thus it is of crucial importance to design efficient
algorithms to perform the change of ordering.
  The main contributions of this paper are several efficient methods for the
change of ordering which take advantage of the sparsity of multiplication
matrices in the classical FGLM algorithm. Combing all these methods, we propose
a deterministic top-level algorithm that automatically detects which method to
use depending on the input. As a by-product, we have a fast implementation that
is able to handle ideals of degree over 40000. Such an implementation
outperforms the Magma and Singular ones, as shown by our experiments.
  First for the shape position case, two methods are designed based on the
Wiedemann algorithm: the first is probabilistic and its complexity to complete
the change of ordering is O(D(N1+nlog(D))), where N1 is the number of nonzero
entries of a multiplication matrix; the other is deterministic and computes the
LEX Groebner basis of the radical of I via Chinese Remainder Theorem. Then for
the general case, the designed method is characterized by the
Berlekamp-Massey-Sakata algorithm from Coding Theory to handle the
multi-dimensional linearly recurring relations. Complexity analyses of all
proposed methods are also provided.
  Furthermore, for generic polynomial systems, we present an explicit formula
for the estimation of the sparsity of one main multiplication matrix, and prove
its construction is free. With the asymptotic analysis of such sparsity, we are
able to show for generic systems the complexity above becomes $O(\sqrt{6/n \pi}

for such functions is exactly the Fourier sparsity of f. Let d be the F2-degree

celebrated ellipsoid algorithm tells us that the full information of input
constraints is not necessary; the algorithm works as long as there exists an
oracle that, on a proposed candidate solution, returns a violation in the
format of a separating hyperplane. Can linear programming still be efficiently
solved if the returned violation is in other formats?
  We study this question in a trial-and-error framework: there is an oracle
that, upon a proposed solution, returns the index of a violated constraint
(with the content of the constraint still hidden). When more than one
constraint is violated, two variants in the model are investigated. (1) The
oracle returns the index of a ""most violated"" constraint, measured by the
Euclidean distance of the proposed solution and the half-spaces defined by the
constraints. In this case, the LP can be efficiently solved. (2) The oracle
returns the index of an arbitrary (i.e., worst-case) violated constraint. In
this case, we give an algorithm with running time exponential in the number of
variables. We then show that the exponential dependence on n is unfortunately
necessary even for the query complexity. These results put together shed light
on the amount of information that one needs in order to solve a linear program
efficiently.
  The proofs of the results employ a variety of geometric techniques, including
McMullen's Upper Bound Theorem, the weighted spherical Voronoi diagram, and the
furthest Voronoi diagram. In addition, we give an alternative proof to a
conjecture of L\'aszl\'o Fejes T\'oth on bounding the number of disconnected
components formed by the union of m convex bodies in R^n. Our proof, inspired
by the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem in global differential geometry, is independent of

paper, we show that the existence of matter is extremely problematic for the

of state of w=-1/3, it is shown that the presence of matter destroys the strict
expansion properties that define the evolution of Rh = ct cosmologies,
distorting the observational properties that are touted as its success. We
further examine whether an evolving dark energy component can save this form of
cosmological expansion in the presence of matter by resulting in an expansion
consistent with a mean value of <w> = -1/3, finding that the presence of mass
requires unphysical forms of the dark energy component in the early universe.
We conclude that matter in the universe significantly limits the fundamental
properties of the Rh = ct cosmology, and that novel, and unphysical, evolution
of the matter component would be required to save it. Given this, Rh = ct
cosmology is not simpler or more accurate description of the universe than
prevailing cosmological models, and its presentation to date possesses
significant flaws.

Bm, by averaging over all available observations using a cosine weighting
method. We have revised our cosine weighting method by now taking into account
more fully the highest latitude geometry. We use the annual variation in the
latitude of the disk center, b0, to deduce the tilt angle of the field relative
to the local vertical so that we can find the radial component of the field, Br
from Bm. We find this tilt angle to be small except for a near-polar zone where
a tilt-angle model can reduce the annual variation. The reduced annual
variation in the deduced Br allows us to study dBr/dt and associated deviations
in Br from a smoothed Br with a smoothing width of 2.5 years. These functions
make evident the presence of small amplitude (3 to 5 gauss) but spatially
coherent ripples with a semi-regular periodicity of 1 to 3 years. At any given
time the half-wavelength (peak-to-trough) is between 15 and 30 degrees of

equator to the poles over a time period of roughly 2 years. The drift rate

solving the non-convex least median estimation problem, is a powerful method

and therefore cannot scale to large problems. A new method for the minimization
of the $L_\infty$ norm is presented here, which provides a speedup of multiple
orders of magnitude for data with high dimension. This method, termed Fast
$L_\infty$ Minimization, allows robust regression to be applied to a class of
problems which were previously inaccessible. It is shown how the $L_\infty$
norm minimization problem can be broken up into smaller sub-problems, which can
then be solved extremely efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate the
radical reduction in computation time, along with robustness against large

formulas for computing classical Severi degrees $N^{d, \delta}$ using long-edge

of a special function associated to long-edge graphs appeared in
Fomin-Mikhalkin's formula, and conjectured it to be linear. They have since
proved their conjecture. At the same time, motivated by their conjecture, we
consider a special multivariate function associated to long-edge graphs that
generalizes their function. The main result of this paper is that the
multivariate function we define is always linear. A special case of our result
gives an independent proof of Block-Colley-Kennedy's conjecture.
  The first application of our linearity result is that by applying it to
classical Severi degrees, we recover quadraticity of $Q^{d, \delta}$ and a
bound $\delta$ for the threshold of polynomiality of $N^{d, \delta}.$ Next, in
joint work with Osserman, we apply the linearity result to a special family of
toric surfaces and obtain universal polynomial results having connections to
the G\""ottsche-Yau-Zaslow formula. As a result, we provide combinatorial
formulas for the two unidentified power series $B_1(q)$ and $B_2(q)$ appearing
in the G\""ottsche-Yau-Zaslow formula.
  The proof of our linearity result is completely combinatorial. We define
$\tau$-graphs which generalize long-edge graphs, and a closely related family
of combinatorial objects we call $(\tau, n)$-words. By introducing height
functions and a concept of irreducibility, we describe ways to decompose
certain families of $(\tau, n)$-words into irreducible words, which leads to

high probability of association (>80 per cent), among which 19 are local
Seyfert galaxies (with median redshift z = 0.03) and 18 blazars. We found that
\approx 20 per cent of the AGN detected in hard X-rays are also bright radio
sources at 20 GHz, but the apparent correlation between the radio and hard
X-ray luminosity is completely driven by the different median redshifts of the
two subgroups of AGN. When we consider only the local Seyfert sample we find no
evidence of a correlation between their 20 GHz and 15-55 keV power. Therefore
it appears that at high frequencies the radio-X connection, which had been
previously observed at lower frequencies, disappears. The disappearance of the
radio-X correlation at high radio and X-ray frequencies could be tested through
Very Long Baseline Interferometry and the use of the Nuclear Spectroscopic

Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) systems have been developed to address these

handpicked features to represent a HEp-2 cell image, which may only work in

comprised of a dual-region codebook-based descriptor, combined with the Nearest
Convex Hull Classifier. We evaluate the performance of several variants of the

first time codebook-based descriptors are applied and studied in this domain.
Experiments show that the proposed system has consistent high performance and
is more robust than two recent CAD systems.

localized magnetic moments. The functional form of the RKKY interaction in
pristine graphene is specified by two main features: (i) an atomic scale
oscillatory part determined by a wave vector $\vec Q$ connecting the two
valleys. Furthermore with doping another longer range oscillation appears which
arise from the existence of an extended Fermi surface characterized by a single
momentum scale $k_F$. (ii) $R^{\alpha}$ decay in large distances where the
exponent $\alpha=-3$ is a distinct feature of undoped Dirac sea (with a linear
dispersion relation) in two dimensions. In this work, we investigate the effect
of a few percent vacancies on the above properties. Depending on the doping
level, if the chemical potential lies on the linear part of the density of
states, the exponent $\alpha$ remains close to -3. Otherwise $\alpha$ reduces
towards more negative values which means that the combined effect of vacancies
and the randomness in their positions makes it harder for the carriers of the
medium to mediate the magnetic interaction. Addition of a few percent of
vacancies diminishes the atomic scale oscillations of the RKKY interaction
signaling the destruction of two-valley structure of the parent graphene
material. Surprisingly by allowing the chemical potential to vary, we find that
the longer-range oscillations expected to arise from the existence of a $k_F$
scale in the vacant graphene are absent. This may indicate possible non-Fermi
liquid behavior by ""alloying"" graphene with vacancies. The complete absence of
oscillations in heavily vacant graphene can be considered an advantage for
applications as a uniform sign of the exchange interaction is desirable for
magnetic ordering.

Virgo spirals are presented. This sample contains 6 galaxies with a global
minimum of 20cm polarized emission at the receding side of the galactic disk
and quadrupolar type large-scale magnetic fields. In the new sample no
additional case of a ram-pressure stripped spiral galaxy with an asymmetric
ridge of polarized radio continuum emission was found. In the absence of a
close companion, a truncated HI disk, together with a ridge of polarized radio
continuum emission at the outer edge of the HI disk, is a signpost of ram
pressure stripping. 6 out of the 19 observed galaxies display asymmetric 6cm
polarized emission distributions. Three galaxies belong to tidally interacting
pairs, two galaxies host huge accreting HI envelopes, and one galaxy had a
recent minor merger. Tidal interactions and accreting gas envelopes can lead to
compression and shear motions which enhance the polarized radio continuum
emission. In addition, galaxies with low average star formation rate per unit
area have a low average degree of polarization. Shear or compression motions
can enhance the degree of polarization. The average degree of polarization of
tidally interacting galaxies is generally lower than expected for a given
rotation velocity and star formation activity. This low average degree of
polarization is at least partly due to the absence of polarized emission from
the thin disk. Ram pressure stripping can decrease whereas tidal interactions
most frequently decreases the average degree of polarization of Virgo spiral
galaxies. We found that moderate active ram pressure stripping has no influence
on the spectral index, but enhances the global radio continuum emission with
respect to the FIR emission, while an accreting gas envelope can but not
necessarily enhances the radio continuum emission with respect to the FIR
emission.

each oscillator is coupled at an arbitrary strength kappa to its nearest
neighbors (""intra-coupling""), as well as the two end oscillators of the chain
are coupled at an arbitrary strength c_nu to two separate baths at arbitrarily
different temperatures, respectively. We derive an exact closed expression for
the steady-state heat current flowing from a hot bath through the chain to a
cold bath, in the Drude-Ullersma damping model going beyond the Markovian
damping. This allows us to explore the behavior of heat current relative to the
intra-coupling strength as a control parameter, especially in pursuit of the
heat power amplification. Then it turns out that in the weak-coupling regime
(kappa, c_nu << 1), the heat current is small, as expected, and almost
independent of chain length N, hence violating Fourier's law of heat
conduction; this is consistent to the earlier results obtained within the
rotating wave approximation for the intra-coupling as well as in the
Born-Markov approximation for the chain-bath coupling. Beyond the weak-coupling
regime, on the other hand, we typically observe that with increase of the
intra-coupling strength the heat current is gradually amplified, and reaches
its maximum value at some specific coupling strength kappa_R ""resonant"" to a
given chain-bath coupling strength. Also, the behavior of heat current versus
chain length appears typically in such a way that the magnitude of current
reaches its maximum with N=1 and then gradually decreases with increase of the
chain length, being in fact almost N-independent in the range of N large
enough. As a result, Fourier's law proves violated also in this regime.

radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs). The flow structure is
geometrically thick, and independent of the gas density and cooling, if the
cooling time is longer than the viscous timescale (i.e., $t_{\rm cool} \gtrsim
t_{\rm visc}$). For higher densities, the gas can cool before it can accrete
and forms the standard geometrically thin, optically thick Shakura-Sunyaev
disk. For usual cooling processes (such as bremsstrahlung), we expect an inner
hot flow and an outer thin disk. For a short cooling time the accretion flow
separates into two phases: a radiatively inefficient hot coronal phase and a
cold thin disk. We argue that there is an upper limit on the density of the hot
corona corresponding to a critical value of $t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff} (\sim
10-100)$, the ratio of the cooling time and the free-fall time. Based on our
simulations, we have developed a model for transients observed in black hole
X-ray binaries (XRBs). An XRB in a quiescent hot RIAF state can transition to a
cold black-body dominated state because of an increase in the mass accretion
rate. The transition from a thin disk to a RIAF happens because of mass
exhaustion due to accretion; the transition happens when the cooling time
becomes longer than the viscous time at inner radii. Since the viscous
timescale for a geometrically thin disk is quite long, the high-soft state is
expected to be long-lived. The different timescales in black hole transients
correspond to different physical processes such as viscous evolution, cooling,
and free-fall. Our model captures the overall features of observed state
transitions in XRBs.

makes this technique sensitive to a wide variety of imperfections and

Typically the graphene samples are supported on a low-loss dielectric

(LS2) in 2017/18 is in preparation. One of the major goals of the proposed
upgrade is to extend the physics reach for rare probes at low transverse
momentum. The reconstruction of the rare probes requires a precise
determination of the primary and secondary vertices that is performed in ALICE
by the Inner Tracking System (ITS). The present ITS made of 6 layers of three
technologies of silicon devices allows, for example, to reconstruct D mesons
with the transverse momentum down to ~2 GeV/c.
  Further extension of this range towards lower pT requires the installation of
the new ITS consisting of 7 layers of silicon detectors with significantly
better single point resolution and reduced material budget. It is expected that
the new system will allow to improve the impact parameter resolution by a
factor of ~3. Moreover, the data rate capability of the upgraded ITS should be
significantly improved in order to exploit the full expected LHC lead-lead
interaction rate of 50 kHz, almost two orders of magnitude above the present
readout rate.
  The present contribution describes first the ITS upgrade requirements
followed by the conceptual design of the new system and its expected
performance. Secondly, an overview of the different R&D activities from the
concept towards the final detector is given.

to streaming along magnetic field lines and resonant scattering off

generated in SNRs, a significant fraction of which occur in OB associations on
a timescale of several $10^7$ years. We examine the effect of changing boundary

flux tube geometry appropriate for disk galaxies, describing the CR
diffusive-advective transport in a hydrodynamical fashion along with the energy
exchange with self-generated MHD waves. Our time-dependent CR hydrodynamic
simulations confirm the existence of time asymptotic outflow solutions (for

geometric entanglement, as measured by the logarithm of the overlap between a
given state and its closest product state of blocks. We do this for a variety
of topologically-ordered systems such as the toric code, double semion, color
code, and quantum double models. As happens for the entanglement entropy, we
find that for sufficiently large block sizes the geometric entanglement is, up
to possible sub-leading corrections, the sum of two contributions: a bulk
contribution obeying a boundary law times the number of blocks, and a
contribution quantifying the underlying pattern of long-range entanglement of
the topologically-ordered state. This topological contribution is also present
in the case of single-spin blocks in most cases, and constitutes an alternative
characterisation of topological order for these quantum states based on a
multipartite entanglement measure. In particular, we see that the topological
term for the 2D color code is twice as much as the one for the toric code, in
accordance with recent renormalization group arguments. Motivated by this, we
also derive a general formalism to obtain upper- and lower-bounds to the
geometric entanglement of states with a non-Abelian symmetry, and which we use
to analyse quantum double models. Furthermore, we also analyse the robustness
of the topological contribution using renormalization and perturbation theory
arguments, as well as a numerical estimation for small systems. Some of our
results rely on the ability to disentangle single sites from the system, which
is always possible in our framework. Aditionally, we relate our results to the
relative entropy of entanglement in topological systems, and discuss some
tensor network numerical approaches that could be used to extract the
topological contribution for large systems beyond exactly-solvable models.

high-temperature superconductor La1.88Sr0.12CuO4 (Tc=27 K). The temperature
dependence of the low-energy incommensurate magnetic fluctuations reveals
distinctly glassy features. The glassiness is confirmed by the difference
between the ordering temperature TN ~ Tc inferred from elastic neutron
scattering and the freezing temperature Tf ~ 11 K obtained from muon spin
rotation studies. The magnetic field independence of the observed excitation
spectrum as well as the observation of a partial suppression of magnetic
spectral weight below 0.75 meV for temperatures smaller than Tf, indicate that
the stripe frozen state is capable of supporting a spin anisotropy gap, of a
magnitude similar to that observed in the spin and charge stripe ordered ground
state of La1.875Ba0.125CuO4. The difference between TN and Tf implies that the
significant enhancement in a magnetic field of nominally elastic incommensurate

maximum in Tf(p), we arrive at the view that the low-energy fluctuations are
strongly dependent on composition in this regime, with anisotropy gaps
dominating only sufficiently close to p=0.12 and superconducting spin gaps
dominating elsewhere.

(in the infinitely many sites model) then it is well known that for each $t>0$
the measure $\mathbf Y_t$ is purely atomic with infinitely many atoms. However,
Schmuland proved that there is a critical value for the mutation rate under
which almost surely there are exceptional times at which $\mathbf Y$ is a
finite sum of weighted Dirac masses. In the present work we discuss the
existence of such exceptional times for the generalized Fleming-Viot processes.
In the case of Beta-Fleming-Viot processes with index $\alpha\in\,]1,2[$ we
show that - irrespectively of the mutation rate and $\alpha$ - the number of
atoms is almost surely always infinite. The proof combines a Pitman-Yor type
representation with a disintegration formula, Lamperti's transformation for
self-similar processes and covering results for Poisson point processes.

twist. The DSL is the formal model of the recently proposed semantics for the
standardization of geometric relations between rigid bodies, referred to as
`geometric semantics'. This semantics explicitly states the
coordinate-invariant properties and operations, and, more importantly, all the
choices that are made in coordinate representations of these geometric
relations. This results in a set of concrete suggestions for standardizing
terminology and notation, allowing programmers to write fully unambiguous
software interfaces, including automatic checks for semantic correctness of all
geometric operations on rigid-body coordinate representations.
  The DSL is implemented in two different ways: an external DSL in Xcore and an
internal DSL in Prolog. Besides defining a grammar and operations, the DSL also
implements constraints. In the Xcore model, the Object Constraint Language
language is used, while in the Prolog model, the constraint are natively
modelled in Prolog.
  This paper discusses the implemented DSL and the tools developed on top of
this DSL. In particular an editor, checking the semantic constraints and
providing semantic meaningful errors during editing is proposed.

an application we show that the FEI conjecture holds for read-once formulas

proved it for read-once decision trees. Our techniques also yield an explicit

central topic in artificial intelligence, with the aim of developing
computationally efficient tools for finding optimal ways to behave in strategic
interactions. The central solution concept in game theory is Nash equilibrium
(NE). However, it fails to capture the possibility that agents can form
coalitions (even in the 2-agent case). Strong Nash equilibrium (SNE) refines NE
to this setting. It is known that finding an SNE is NP-complete when the number
of agents is constant. This hardness is solely due to the existence of
mixed-strategy SNEs, given that the problem of enumerating all pure-strategy
SNEs is trivially in P. Our central result is that, in order for a game to have
at least one non-pure-strategy SNE, the agents' payoffs restricted to the
agents' supports must, in the case of 2 agents, lie on the same line, and, in
the case of n agents, lie on an (n - 1)-dimensional hyperplane. Leveraging this
result, we provide two contributions. First, we develop worst-case instances
for support-enumeration algorithms. These instances have only one SNE and the
support size can be chosen to be of any size-in particular, arbitrarily large.
Second, we prove that, unlike NE, finding an SNE is in smoothed polynomial
time: generic game instances (i.e., all instances except knife-edge cases) have
only pure-strategy SNEs.

archived +240-h forecasts of the ECMWF ensemble prediction system (EPS) from
1999 to 2009.
  We make three assumptions: First, each forecast is representative of a
six-hour interval and collectively the data set is then comparable to a time
period of 226 years. Second, the model climate matches the observed
distribution, which we confirm by comparing with buoy data. Third, the ensemble
members are sufficiently uncorrelated to be considered independent realizations
of the model climate. We find anomaly correlations of 0.20, but peak events
(>P97) are entirely uncorrelated. By comparing return values from individual
members with return values of subsamples of the data set we also find that the
estimates follow the same distribution and appear unaffected by correlations in
the ensemble. The annual mean and variance over the 11-year archived period
exhibit no significant departures from stationarity compared with a recent
reforecast, i.e., there is no spurious trend due to model upgrades.
  EPS yields significantly higher return values than ERA-40 and ERA-Interim and
is in good agreement with the high-resolution hindcast NORA10, except in the
lee of unresolved islands where EPS overestimates and in enclosed seas where it
is biased low. Confidence intervals are half the width of those found for
ERA-Interim due to the magnitude of the data set.

questions concerning the formation process, the source of energy for melting
the rims, and the composition of the origin material. The aim of this work is
to explore the heating of the chondrule in a single precursor as is typical for
radiation hydrodynamical shock waves. We take into account the gas-particle
friction for the duration of the shock transition and calculate the heat
conduction into the chondrules. These processes are located in the
protoplanetary nebulae at a region around 2.5 AU, which is considered to be the
most likely place of chondrule formation. The present models are a first step
towards computing radiative shock waves occurring in a particle-rich
environment. We calculated the shock waves using one-dimensional,
time-independent equations of radiation hydrodynamics involving realistic gas
and dust opacities and gas-particle friction. The evolution of spherical
chondrules was followed by solving the heat conduction equation on an adaptive
grid. The results for the shock-heating event are consistent with the
cosmochemical constraints of chondrule properties. The calculations yield a
relative narrow range for density or temperature to meet the requested heating
rates of $R > 10^4\,K\, h^{-1}$ as extracted from cosmochemical constraints.
Molecular gas, opacities with dust, and a protoplanetary nebula with accretion
are necessary requirements for a fast heating process. The thermal structure in
the far post-shock region is not fully consistent with experimental constraints

focused on turbulence generation, gravitational collapse, magnetic fields, and

one with a collision between two smooth streams, and one with streams
containing small clumps. We find that structured converging flows lead to a
delay of local gravitational collapse (""star formation""). Thus, more gas has
time to accumulate, eventually leading to a strong global collapse, and thus to
a high star formation rate. Uniform converging flows fragment hydrodynamically
early on, leading to the rapid onset of local gravitational collapse and an
overall low sink formation rate.

the centrifugal barrier and whether it is subject to fragmentation. We find
that the collapse leads either to a central runaway or to off-center
fragmentation. A disk-like configuration is formed inside the centrifugal
barrier. For more cuspy DM distribution, the gas collapses more and experiences
a bar-like perturbation and a central runaway. We have followed this inflow
down to ~10^{-4} pc. The flow remains isothermal and the specific angular
momentum is efficiently transferred by gravitational torques in a cascade of
nested bars. This cascade supports a self-similar, disk-like collapse. In the
collapsing phase, virial supersonic turbulence develops and fragmentation is
damped. For larger initial DM cores the timescales become longer. In models
with more organized initial rotation, a torus forms and appears to be supported
by turbulent motions. The evolution depends on the competition between two
timescales, corresponding to the onset of the central runaway and off-center
fragmentation. For less organized rotation, the torus is greatly weakened, the
central accretion timescale is shortened, and off-center fragmentation is
suppressed --- triggering the central runaway even in previously `stable'
models. The resulting SMBH masses lie in the range 2 x 10^4 Mo - 2 x 10^6 Mo,
much higher than for Population III remnants. We argue that the above upper
limit appears to be more realistic mass. Corollaries of this model include a
possible correlation between SMBH and DM halo masses, and similarity between
the SMBH and halo mass functions, at time of formation.

clues to their formation histories. Unfortunately, it is difficult to
disentangle the two components and to recover their stellar kinematics in the
faint outer parts of the galaxies using conventional absorption line
spectroscopy. This paper therefore presents the stellar kinematics of six S0
galaxies derived from observations of planetary nebulae (PNe), obtained using
the Planetary Nebula Spectrograph. To separate the kinematics of the two
components, we use a maximum-likelihood method that combines the discrete
kinematic data with a photometric component decomposition. The results of this
analysis reveal that: the discs of S0 galaxies are rotationally supported;
however, the amount of random motion in these discs is systematically higher
than in comparable spiral galaxies; and the S0s lie around one magnitude below
the Tully--Fisher relation for spiral galaxies, while their spheroids lie
nearly one magnitude above the Faber--Jackson relation for ellipticals. All of
these findings are consistent with a scenario in which spirals are converted
into S0s through a process of mild harassment or ""pestering,"" with their discs
somewhat heated and their spheroid somewhat enhanced by the conversion process.
In such a scenario, one might expect the properties of S0s to depend on
environment. We do not see such an effect in this fairly small sample, although
any differences would be diluted by the fact that the current location does not
necessarily reflect the environment in which the transformation occurred.
Similar observations of larger samples probing a broader range of environments,
coupled with more detailed modelling of the transformation process to match the
wide range of parameters that we have shown can now be measured, should take us
from these first steps to the definitive answer as to how S0 galaxies form.

variables there are only four possible rooted tree structures and, based on a
sample, a choice can be made by performing comparisons between the three
bivariate margins of the empirical distribution of the three variables. The set

of coordinated fluctuations around their native structure, or of wider and

descriptions are known to capture essential aspects of conformational dynamics
in proteins, but have so far remained mostly phenomenological, and unable to
account for the chemical specificities of amino acids. Here, we propose a
method to derive residue- and distance-specific effective harmonic potentials
from the statistical analysis of an extensive dataset of NMR conformational

statistical potentials commonly used for static analyses of protein structures.
In the context of the elastic network model, they yield a strongly improved
description of the cooperative aspects of residue motions, and give the
opportunity to systematically explore the influence of sequence details on

arbitrarily long wavelengths. Furthermore, efficient carrier multiplication by

applications. However, all these effects are difficult to test quantitatively

reflect the energy and momentum dependent carrier distributions. Here, we use
time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with femtosecond extreme
ultra-violet (EUV) pulses at 31.5 eV photon energy to directly probe the
non-equilibrium response of Dirac electrons near the K-point of the Brillouin

in the mid- and near-infrared, both below and above the minimum photon energy
for direct interband transitions. While excitation in the mid-infrared results
only in heating of the equilibrium carrier distribution, interband excitations
give rise to population inversion, suggesting that terahertz lasing may be
possible. However, in neither excitation regime do we find indication for
carrier multiplication, questioning the applicability of graphene for light
harvesting. Time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in the EUV emerges as the
technique of choice to assess the suitability of new materials for

it is the vertical clearance needed inside the vacuum chambers for the
construction of numerous, long pendulum stages necessary for effective
horizontal vibration isolation. The purpose of this work is to introduce a new
concept, called the multi-nested pendula concept, which solves this problem.
The attenuation performance of an ideal multistage nested pendula filter is
better than that of an ideal multistage common equal pendula filter by a factor
of N^{N}, where N is the number of stages used, making this idea of a
multi-nested pendula a very interesting one. The initial results (of stability
and system resonances) measured for a prototype reinforce the viability of the

objects. Regular scans of the Galactic Plane by INTEGRAL provide the most
sensitive hard X-ray wide survey to date of our Galaxy, with flux limits of the
order of 0.3 mCrab for an exposure time of ~2Ms. Many transient sources have
been detected on a wide range of time scales (~hours to months) and identified
by triggered followup observations, mainly by Swift/XRT and optical/infrared
telescopes. These discoveries are very important to characterize the X-ray
binary population in our Galaxy, that is necessary input for evolution studies.
The transient source monitoring is crucial to sample a variety of physical
conditions corresponding to a large span in luminosity. The long exposure times
available allow us to define the spectral and timing properties of the known
sources and the global properties of each object class.

(SDSS griz) and near-infrared (UKIRT ZYJHK) photometry is used to classify the
target sample of 4600 M dwarfs with J magnitudes in the range 11-17. Most have
spectral-types in the range M0-M2. We conduct Monte Carlo transit injection and
detection simulations for short period (<10 day) Jupiter- and Neptune-sized
planets to characterize the sensitivity of the survey. We investigate the
recovery rate as a function of period and magnitude for 4 hypothetical

find that the WTS lightcurves are very sensitive to the presence of

produce a much weaker signal and suffer a correspondingly smaller recovery
fraction. Neptunes can only be reliably recovered with the correct period
around the rather small sample (~100) of the latest M dwarfs (M4-M9) in the

image and updating the set of damaged pixels, these methods have better
performance than other methods, as shown in the experiments. In addition, we
provide convergence analysis for these methods, these algorithms will converge

viscosity, the gelation time and the cluster size are predicted in closed form
analytically as a function of time, initial volume fraction and attraction
energy by combining the reversible clustering kinetics with an approximate
hydrodynamic model. The fractal dimension $d_{f}$ modulates the time evolution
of cluster size, lag time and gelation time and of the viscosity. The gelation
transition is strongly nonequilibrium and time-dependent in the unstable region
of the state diagram of colloids where the association rate is larger than the
dissociation rate. Only upon approaching conditions where the initial
association and the dissociation rates are comparable for all species (which is
a condition for the detailed balance to be satisfied) aggregation can occur
with $d_{f}=3$. In this limit, homogeneous nucleation followed by
Lifshitz-Slyozov coarsening is recovered. In this limited region of the state
diagram the macroscopic gelation process is likely to be driven by large
spontaneous fluctuations associated with spinodal decomposition.

  Ailamaki","RITA: An Index-Tuning Advisor for Replicated Databases","15 pages, 11 figures",,,,"cs.DB","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  Given a replicated database, a divergent design tunes the indexes in each
replica differently in order to specialize it for a specific subset of the
workload. This specialization brings significant performance gains compared to
the common practice of having the same indexes in all replicas, but requires
the development of new tuning tools for database administrators. In this paper
we introduce RITA (Replication-aware Index Tuning Advisor), a novel
divergent-tuning advisor that offers several essential features not found in
existing tools: it generates robust divergent designs that allow the system to
adapt gracefully to replica failures; it computes designs that spread the load
evenly among specialized replicas, both during normal operation and when
replicas fail; it monitors the workload online in order to detect changes that
require a recomputation of the divergent design; and, it offers suggestions to
elastically reconfigure the system (by adding/removing replicas or
adding/dropping indexes) to respond to workload changes. The key technical
innovation behind RITA is showing that the problem of selecting an optimal
design can be formulated as a Binary Integer Program (BIP). The BIP has a
relatively small number of variables, which makes it feasible to solve it
efficiently using any off-the-shelf linear-optimization software. Experimental
results demonstrate that RITA computes better divergent designs compared to
existing tools, offers more features, and has fast execution times.

fundamental harmonic of susceptibility $\chi''_1$ and third harmonic voltage
$V_3$ criteria were considered for the determination of the full penetration
field. In order to verify the reliability of this technique under two criteria,
we investigated the homogeneity of $J_c$ via transport measurements conducted
on four microbridges patterned in the same film. Based on the transport method
we found that both techniques yield similar results in the determination of
$J_c$ for temperatures close to critical temperature $T_c$. However, at
temperatures relatively far from $T_c$, the $V_3$ criterion showed a better
agreement with the transport data. Furthermore, using both criteria, we propose
a methodology to estimate in situ the coil factor associated with the $V_3$
criterion, avoiding in this way the need of implementing an additional
technique.

encourage a wider adoption of large-scale monitoring and decision systems
relying on end-user information. A promising approach to develop these
mechanisms is to specify quantitative privacy requirements at design time
rather than as an afterthought, and to rely on signal processing techniques to
achieve satisfying trade-offs between privacy and performance specifications.
This paper discusses, from the signal processing point of view, an event stream
analysis problem introduced in the database and cryptography literature. A
discrete-valued input signal describes the occurrence of events contributed by
end-users, and a system is supposed to provide some output signal based on this
information, while preserving the privacy of the participants. The notion of
privacy adopted here is that of event-level differential privacy, which
provides strong privacy guarantees and has important operational advantages.
Several mechanisms are described to provide differentially private output
signals while minimizing the impact on performance. These mechanisms
demonstrate the benefits of leveraging system theoretic techniques to provide
privacy guarantees for dynamic systems.

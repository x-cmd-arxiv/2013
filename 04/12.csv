quantum size effect based on free electrons was proposed in explanation. To
test this idea, we calculate the total energies of Bi on the Ni(111) surface
using density functional theory. We find that HCP film stabilities disagree
with the observed odd layer preferences, and the structures are mechanically
destabilized by adding capping atoms which pucker the HCP layers. Furthermore,
we find that rhombohedral films based on the bulk Bi structure are
energetically more favorable than the proposed HCP films. These structures also
favor odd numbers of layers, but owing to covalent chemical bonding rather than
confinement of free electrons. Specifically, a strongly bound adsorbed surface
monolayer forms, followed by bulk-like rhombohedral bilayers.

investigated on polycrystalline samples of the new superconductor Bi4O4S3. A
weak insulating behavior in the resistive curve has been induced in the normal
state when the superconductivity is suppressed by applying a magnetic field.
Interestingly, a kink appears on the temperature dependence of resistivity near
4 K at all high magnetic fields above 1 T when the bulk superconductivity is
completely suppressed. This kink associated with the upper critical field as
well as the wide range of excess conductance at low field and high temperature
are explained as the possible evidence of strong superconducting fluctuation.
From the tunneling spectra, a superconducting gap of about 3 meV is frequently
observed yielding a ratio of 2\Delta/(kB*Tc) ~ 16.6. This value is much larger
than the one predicted by the BCS theory in the weak coupling regime
(2\Delta/(kB*Tc) ~ 3.53), which suggests the strong coupling superconductivity
in the present system. Furthermore, the gapped feature persists on the spectra
until 14 K in the STS measurement, which suggests a prominent fluctuation
region of superconductivity. Such superconducting fluctuation can survive at
very high magnetic fields, which are far beyond the critical fields for bulk
superconductivity as inferred both from electric transport and tunneling
measurements.

Perturbation Theory (ChPT) that the QCD pseudoscalar susceptibility is
proportional to the quark condensate at low $T$. Next, we show that this
chiral-restoring behaviour for $\chi_P$ is compatible with recent lattice
results for screening masses and gives rise to degeneration between the scalar
and pseudoscalar susceptibilities ($\chi_S$, $\chi_P$) around the transition
point, consistently with an O(4)-like current restoration pattern. This
scenario is clearly confirmed by lattice data when we compare $\chi_S(T)$ with
the quark condensate, expected to scale as $\chi_P(T)$. Finally, we show that
saturating $\chi_S$ with the $\sigma/f_0(500)$ broad resonance observed in pion
scattering and including its finite temperature dependence, allows to describe
the peak structure of $\chi_S(T)$ in lattice data and the associated critical
temperature. This is carried out within a unitarized ChPT scheme which
generates the resonant state dynamically and is also consistent with partner
degeneration.

to provide several results on the (strict) improvement of convexity under the

caused by a deceptive fitness function. In this paper, we apply novelty search
combined with NEAT to the evolution of neural controllers for homogeneous
swarms of robots. Our empirical study is conducted in simulation, and we use a
common swarm robotics task - aggregation, and a more challenging task - sharing
of an energy recharging station. Our results show that novelty search is
unaffected by deception, is notably effective in bootstrapping the evolution,
can find solutions with lower complexity than fitness-based evolution, and can
find a broad diversity of solutions for the same task. Even in non-deceptive
setups, novelty search achieves solution qualities similar to those obtained in
traditional fitness-based evolution. Our study also encompasses variants of
novelty search that work in concert with fitness-based evolution to combine the
exploratory character of novelty search with the exploitatory character of
objective-based evolution. We show that these variants can further improve the
performance of novelty search. Overall, our study shows that novelty search is
a promising alternative for the evolution of controllers for robotic swarms.

find that a significantly reduced coupling of the Higgs to the top quark is
possible and slightly favored by searches on Higgs production in association
with top quark pairs. The total width of the Higgs boson is only weakly
constrained and can vary between 0.7 and 2.7 times the Standard Model value

speaking, we consider different bounds for the derivatives of $f \in C^k(D_d)$

consider various values of $k$ including the case $k=\infty$ which corresponds
to infinitely many differentiable functions. We obtain necessary and sufficient

if the bounds on the successive derivatives are appropriately large. The proof
technique is based on a volume estimate of a neighborhood of the convex hull of
$n$ points which decays exponentially fast if $n$ is small relative to $d$. For
$k=\infty$, we also also study conditions for quasi-polynomial, weak and

evolutionary synthesis models. The main goal of this work is to present and
discuss the synthetic photometric properties of Single Stellar Populations
(SSPs) resulting from our POPSTAR code. Colours in the Johnson and SDSS
systems, halpha and hbeta luminosities and equivalent widths, and ionising
region size, have been computed for a wide range of metallicity (Z = 0.0001 -
0.05) and age (0.1 Myr to 20 Gyr). We demonstrate the importance of the
contribution of emission lines to broader-band photometry when characterising
stellar populations, through the presentation of both contaminated and
non-contaminated colours (in both the Johnson and SDSS systems). The tabulated
colours include stellar and nebular components, in addition to line emission.
The main application of these models is the determination of physical
properties of a given young ionising cluster, when only photometric
observations are available; for an isolated star forming region, the young star
cluster models can be used, free from the contamination of any underlying
background stellar population. In most cases, however, the ionising population
is usually embedded in a large and complex system, and the observed photometric
properties result from the combination of a young star-forming burst and the
underlying older population of the host. Therefore, the second objective of
this paper is to provide a grid of models useful in the interpretation of mixed
regions where the separation of young and old populations is not sufficiently
reliable. We describe the set of PopStar Spectral Energy Distributions, the
derived colours and other photometric parameters, for mixed populations where
an underlying host population is combined in different mass ratios with a
recent ionising burst.

reveal themselves as luminous flares of UV/soft X-ray emission associated with
the centres of previously non-active galaxies and fading by few orders of
magnitude on time-scales of several months to years. Given that eROSITA will
complete an all-sky survey every 6 months and a total of 8 such scans will be
performed over the course of the mission, we propose to distinguish TDEs from
other X-ray transients using two criteria: I) large (more than a factor of 10)
X-ray variation between two subsequent 6-month scans and ii) soft X-ray
spectrum. The expected number of TDE candidates is $\sim 10^3$ per scan (with
most of the events being new discoveries in a given scan), so that a total of
several thousand TDE candidates could be found during the 4-year survey. The
actual number may significantly differ from this estimate, since it is based on
just a few TDEs observed so far. The eROSITA all-sky survey is expected to be
nearly equally sensitive to TDEs occurring near supermassive black holes (SMBH)
of mass between $\sim 10^6$ and $\sim 10^7 M_\odot$ and will thus provide a
unique census of quiescent SMBHs and associated nuclear stellar cusps in the
local Universe ($z\lesssim 0.15$). Information on TDE candidates will be
available within a day after their detection and localization by eROSITA,
making possible follow-up observations that may reveal peculiar types of TDEs.

models of the viscoelastic Maxwell body. This model is based on the
multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient, combined with
Neo-Hookean hyperelastic relations between stresses and elastic strains. The
evolution equation is six dimensional. For the corresponding local initial
value problem, a fully implicit integration procedure is considered, and a
simple explicit update formula is derived. Thus, no local iterative procedure
is required, which makes the numerical scheme more robust and efficient. The
resulting integration algorithm is unconditionally stable and first order
accurate. The incompressibility constraint of the inelastic flow is exactly
preserved. A rigorous proof of the symmetry of the consistent tangent operator
is provided. Moreover, some properties of the numerical solution, like
invariance under the change of the reference configuration and positive energy
dissipation within a time step, are discussed. Numerical tests show that, in
terms of accuracy, the proposed integration algorithm is equivalent to the
classical implicit scheme based on the exponential mapping. Finally, in order
to check the stability of the algorithm numerically, a representative initial
boundary value problem involving finite viscoelastic deformations is
considered. An FEM solution of the representative problem using MSC.MARC is

burst. To study these effects, simulations in general relativity with a hot
microphysical equation of state and neutrino feedback are needed. We present
the first such simulation, using a neutrino leakage scheme for cooling to
capture the most essential effects and considering a moderate mass (1.4
M_{\odot} neutron star, 5.6 M_{\odot} black hole), high spin (black hole

find that about 0.08 M_{\odot} of nuclear matter is ejected from the system,

effects of the escaping neutrinos are (i) to make the disk much denser and more
compact, (ii) to cause the average electron fraction Y_e of the disk to rise to
about 0.2 and then gradually decrease again, and (iii) to gradually cool the
disk. The disk is initially hot (T~6 MeV) and luminous in neutrinos
(L_{\nu}~10^{54} erg s^{-1}), but the neutrino luminosity decreases by an order
of magnitude over 50 ms of post-merger evolution.

that HBT correlation increases combinatorially with the number of detectors.
Signal to noise considerations suggest, that many-detector HBT correlations

controllers for swarm robotics. In existing studies, however, the experimenter
had to craft a domain dependent behaviour similarity measure to use novelty
search in swarm robotics applications. The reliance on hand-crafted similarity
measures places an additional burden to the experimenter and introduces a bias
in the evolutionary process. In this paper, we propose and compare two
task-independent, generic behaviour similarity measures: combined state count
and sampled average state. The proposed measures use the values of sensors and
effectors recorded for each individual robot of the swarm. The characterisation
of the group-level behaviour is then obtained by combining the sensor-effector
values from all the robots. We evaluate the proposed measures in an aggregation
task and in a resource sharing task. We show that the generic measures match
the performance of domain dependent measures in terms of solution quality. Our
results indicate that the proposed generic measures operate as effective
behaviour similarity measures, and that it is possible to leverage the benefits
of novelty search without having to craft domain specific similarity measures.

In a background that interpolates between an AdS to an

exists a critical surface beyond which the violation of NEC would naively
occur. However, the extremal area surfaces that determine the entanglement
entropy for the boundary theory, can penetrate into this forbidden region only
for certain choices for the mass and the charge functions in the background.
This penetration is then perceived as the violation of SSA in the boundary
theory. We also find that this happens only when the critical surface lies
above the apparent horizon, but not otherwise. We conjecture that SSA, which is
thus non-trivially related to NEC, also characterizes the entire time-evolution
process along which the dual field theory may thermalize.

Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stt628",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, globular star clusters which contain a sub-system of
stellar-mass black holes (BH) are investigated. This is done by considering
two-component models, as these are the simplest approximation of more realistic
multi-mass systems, where one component represents the BH population and the
other represents all the other stars. These systems are found to undergo a long
phase of evolution where the centre of the system is dominated by a dense BH
sub-system. After mass segregation has driven most of the BH into a compact
sub-system, the evolution of the BH sub-system is found to be influenced by the
cluster in which it is contained. The BH sub-system evolves in such a way as to
satisfy the energy demands of the whole cluster, just as the core of a one
component system must satisfy the energy demands of the whole cluster. The BH
sub-system is found to exist for a significant amount of time. It takes
approximately 10t_{rh,i}, where t_{rh,i} is the initial half-mass relaxation
time, from the formation of the compact BH sub-system up until the time when
90% of the sub-system total mass is lost (which is of order 10^{3} times the
half-mass relaxation time of the BH sub-system at its time of formation). Based
on theoretical arguments the rate of mass loss from the BH sub-system
(\dot{M}_2) is predicted to be -(beta*zeta*M)/(alpha*t_{rh}), where M is the
total mass, t_{rh} is the half-mass relaxation time, and alpha, beta, zeta are
three dimensionless parameters (see Section 2 for details). An interesting
consequence of this is that the rate of mass loss from the BH sub-system is
approximately independent of the stellar mass ratio (m_2/m_1) and the total
mass ratio (M_2/M_1) (in the range m_2/m_1 >~ 10 and M_2/M_1 ~ 10^{-2}, where
m_1, m_2 are the masses of individual low-mass and high-mass particles
respectively, and M_1, M_2 are the corresponding total masses).

little correlation between the likelihood and actual (listening) rating for the

model that explains the interplay between explanations and background

rating for an artist. Acknowledging the impact of explanations, we discuss a
general recommendation framework that models external informational elements in
the recommendation interface, in addition to inherent preferences of users.

for the character of an irreducible minimal support module in type A_{n-1} for
c=m/n, and an expression of its quasispherical part (i.e., the isotypic part of
""hooks"") in terms of the HOMFLY polynomial of a torus knot colored by a Young

give explicit formulas for the characters of the irreducible equivariant
D-modules on the nilpotent cone for SL_m. Our third result is the construction
of the Koszul-BGG complex for the rational Cherednik algebra, which generalizes
the construction of the Koszul-BGG resolution by Berest-Etingof-Ginzburg and
Gordon, and the calculation of its homology in type A. We also show in type A
that the differentials in the Koszul-BGG complex are uniquely determined by the
condition that they are nonzero homomorphisms of modules over the Cherednik
algebra. Finally, our fourth result is the symmetry theorem, which identifies
the quasispherical components in the representations with minimal support over
the rational Cherednik algebras H_{m/n}(S_n) and H_{n/m}(S_m). In fact, we show
that the simple quotients of the corresponding quasispherical subalgebras are
isomorphic as filtered algebras. This symmetry has a natural interpretation in

we find that a local, ~kpc-scale column density of log N_(HI) = 20.6 cm^(-2) is
frequently required for detecting clustered star formation. This HI gas also
tends to be turbulent, with line-of-sight velocity dispersions ~10--75 km/s,
implying high kinetic energy densities (>46 erg pc^(-2)). Thus, high HI
densities and pressures, partly determined by the tail dynamical age and other
interaction characteristics, are connected to large-scale cluster formation in
tidal tails overall. Lastly, we find that the high mechanical energy densities
of the gas are likely not generally due to feedback from star formation.
Rather, these properties are more likely to be a cause of star formation than a
result.

bright flares at times on the order of minutes to days. One proposed
explanation for these flares is the interaction of a relativistic blast wave
with a circumburst density transition. In this paper, we model this type of
interaction computationally in one and two dimensions, using a relativistic
hydrodynamics code with adaptive mesh refinement called RAM, and analytically
in one dimension. We simulate a blast wave traveling in a stellar wind
environment that encounters a sudden change in density, followed by a
homogeneous medium, and compute the observed radiation using a synchrotron
model. We show that flares are not observable for an encounter with a sudden
density increase, such as a wind termination shock, nor for an encounter with a
sudden density decrease. Furthermore, by extending our analysis to two
dimensions, we are able to resolve the spreading, collimation, and edge effects
of the blast wave as it encounters the change in circumburst medium. In all
cases considered in this paper, we find that a flare will not be observed for
any of the density changes studied.

of a fast-rotating magnetically accreting white dwarf can successfully explain
these phenomena. We present a study of FS Aur based on two extensive sets of
optical photometric observations and three X-ray data sets in which we intended
to verify whether the observational properties of the long period modulations
observed in FS Aur and V455 And are similar in appearance to the spin
modulation in ordinary IPs. These new optical observations have revealed, for
the first time in photometric data, the variability with the presumed
precession period of the white dwarf, previously seen only spectroscopically.
We also found that the modulations with the precession and orbital periods are
evident in X-ray data. We show that the observed properties of FS Aur closely
resemble those of other intermediate polars, thus confirming this cataclysmic
variable as a member of the class.
  Our analysis of multicolour observations of intermediate polars has shown
that time-series analysis of colour indices appears to be a powerful technique
for revealing hidden variabilities and shedding light on their nature. We have
found that the (B-I) power spectrum of V1223 Sgr indicates the presence in the
data of the spin pulsation which is not seen in the optical light curve at all.
Also, the analysis of the colour indices of V455 And revealed the presence of

10% reaching the high magnification A>100 that makes them especially sensitive

shock tube tests, with and without cooling, the non-linear thin-shell
instability and the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The main conclusions are :
(i) the two methods converge in the limit of high resolution and accuracy in
most cases. All tests show good agreement when numerical effects (e.g.
discontinuities in SPH) are properly treated. (ii) Both methods can capture
adiabatic shocks and well-resolved cooling shocks perfectly well with standard
prescriptions. However, they both have problems when dealing with
under-resolved cooling shocks, or strictly isothermal shocks, at high Mach
numbers. The finite volume code only works well at 1st order and even then
requires some additional artificial viscosity. SPH requires either a larger
value of the artificial viscosity parameter, alpha_AV, or a modified form of
the standard artificial viscosity term using the harmonic mean of the density,
rather than the arithmetic mean. (iii) Some SPH simulations require larger
kernels to increase neighbour number and reduce particle noise in order to
achieve agreement with finite volume simulations. However, this is partly due
to the need to reduce noise that can corrupt the growth of small-scale
perturbations. In contrast, instabilities seeded from large-scale perturbations
do not require more neighbours and hence work well with standard SPH
formulations and converge with the finite volume simulations. (iv) For purely
hydrodynamical problems, SPH simulations take an order of magnitude longer to
run than finite volume simulations when running at equivalent resolutions, i.e.
when they both resolve the underlying physics to the same degree. This requires
about 2-3 times as many particles as the number of cells.

HD 150136 is a triple hierarchical system and a non-thermal radio
emitter. It is formed by an O3-3.5 V + O5.5-6 V close binary and a more distant
O6.5-7 V tertiary. So far, only the inner orbital properties have been reliably
constrained.
  Aims. To quantitatively understand the non-thermal emission process, accurate
knowledge of the physical and orbital properties of the object is crucial.
Here, we aim to investigate the orbital properties of the wide system and to
constrain the inclinations of the inner and outer binaries, and with these the
absolute masses of the system components.
  Methods. We used the PIONIER combiner at the Very Large Telescope
Interferometer to obtain the very first interferometric measurements of HD
150136. We combined the interferometric observations with new and existing high
resolution spectroscopic data to derive the orbital solution of the outer
companion in the three-dimensional space.
  Results. The wide system is clearly resolved by PIONIER, with a projected
separation on the plane of the sky of about 9 milli-arcsec. The best-fit
orbital period, eccentricity, and inclination are 8.2 yr, 0.73 and 108 degr. We
constrain the masses of the three stars of the system to 63 +/- 10, 40 +/- 6,
and 33 +/- 12 Msun for the O3-3.5 V, O5.5-6 V and O6.5-7 V components.
  Conclusions. The dynamical masses agree within errors with the evolutionary
masses of the components. Future interferometric and spectroscopic monitoring
of HD 150136 should allow one to reduce the uncertainties to a few per cent
only and to accurately constrain the distance to the system. This makes HD
150136 an ideal system to quantitatively test evolutionary models of high-mass
stars as well as the physics of non-thermal processes occurring in O-type
systems.

that this decoupling occurs in generic backgrounds. We show how the decoupling
of high mass states in the (d+1)-dimensional bulk relates to the decoupling of
high energy states in the d-dimensional broken CFT. In other words, we explain
why both high dimension operators and high mass states in the CFT decouple from
the low-energy physics of the mesons and glueballs. In many cases, the
decoupling can occur exponentially fast in the dimension of the operator.
Holography motivates a new kind of form factor proportional to the two point
function between broken CFT operators with very different scaling dimensions.
This new notion of decoupling can provide a systematic justification for
holographic descriptions of QCD and condensed matter systems with only light

newly-identified, and we find no evidence for transient phenomena. This new
sample of variable sources allows us to infer an upper limit to the mean

only 1% of extragalactic sources have fractional variability f_var >3, while
44% of Galactic sources vary by this much. The variable sample contains a
larger fraction of quasars than a comparable non-variable control sample,
though the majority of the variable sources appear to be extended galaxies in

detect the host galaxies of some low-z quasars. We use the new, higher

confinement of mobile electrons at the interface between two insulating oxides,
such as LaAlO_3 and SrTiO_3 (LAO/STO). These electrons have been recently shown
to exhibit a large spin-orbit coupling of the Rashba type, i.e., linear in the
in-plane momentum. In this paper we study the intrinsic spin Hall effect due to
Rashba coupling in an asymmetric triangular potential well. Besides splitting
each subband into two branches of opposite helicity, the spin-orbit interaction
causes the wave function in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the
quantum well (the z direction) to depend on the in-plane wave vector k. In
contrast to the extreme asymmetric case, i.e., the wedge-shaped quantum well,
for which the intrinsic spin Hall effect vanishes due to vertex corrections, we
find that the asymmetric well supports a non-vanishing intrinsic spin Hall
conductivity, which increases in magnitude as the well becomes more symmetric.
The spin Hall conductivity is found to be proportional to the square of the
spin-orbit coupling constant and, in the limit of low carrier density, depends
only on the effective mass renormalization associated with the k-dependence of
the wave functions in the z direction. Its origin lies in the non-vanishing
matrix elements of the spin current between subbands corresponding to different
states of quantized motion perpendicular to the plane of the well.

you, on average."" This paradox arises because extremely popular people, despite
being rare, are overrepresented when averaging over friends. Using a sample of
the Twitter firehose, we confirm that the friendship paradox holds for >98% of
Twitter users. Because of the directed nature of the follower graph on Twitter,
we are further able to confirm more detailed forms of the friendship paradox:
everyone you follow or who follows you has more friends and followers than you.
This is likely caused by a correlation we demonstrate between Twitter activity,
number of friends, and number of followers. In addition, we discover two new
paradoxes: the virality paradox that states ""your friends receive more viral
content than you, on average,"" and the activity paradox, which states ""your
friends are more active than you, on average."" The latter paradox is important
in regulating online communication. It may result in users having difficulty
maintaining optimal incoming information rates, because following additional
users causes the volume of incoming tweets to increase super-linearly. While
users may compensate for increased information flow by increasing their own
activity, users become information overloaded when they receive more
information than they are able or willing to process. We compare the average
size of cascades that are sent and received by overloaded and underloaded
users. And we show that overloaded users post and receive larger cascades and
they are poor detector of small cascades.

of a crystal, without involving magnetic order, has found experimental support
in several systems, from semiconductor heterostructures and ruthenates, to
cuprate and iron-pnictide superconductors. In the pnictide BaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$,
such an ""electronic nematic state"" appears above the magnetic transition dome,
over a temperature range that can be controlled by external strain. Here, by
measuring the in-plane resistivity anisotropy, we probe the electronic
anisotropy of this material over the entire nematic/magnetic dome, whose end
points coincide with the optimal superconducting transition temperatures.
Counter-intuitively, we find that, unlike other materials, the resistivity
anisotropy in BaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ changes sign across the doping phase diagram,
even though the signs of the magnetic, nematic, and orthorhombic order
parameters are kept fixed. This behavior is explained by the Fermi surface
reconstruction in the magnetic phase and spin-fluctuation scattering in the
nematic phase. The unique behavior of the transport anisotropy unveils that the
primary role is played by magnetic scattering in the normal state transport
properties of the iron pnictides, suggesting a close connection between
magnetism, nematicity, and unconventional superconductivity.

technique exploits the sensitivity of certain optical lines to changes in
depletion of metals onto dust grains and uses photo-ionization models to
constrain these physical ratios along with the metallicity (Z) and dust column
density. We compare our gas column density estimates with HI and CO gas mass
estimates in nearby galaxies to show that we recover their total gas mass
surface density to within a factor of 2 up to a total surface gas mass density
of ~75 Mo/pc^2. Our technique is independent of the conversion factor of CO to
H2 and we show that a Z-dependent XCO is required to achieve good agreement
between our measurements and that provided by CO and HI. However we also show
that our method can not be reliably aperture corrected to total gas mass. We
calculate dust-to-gas ratios for all star-forming galaxies in the SDSS DR7 and
show the resulting dependence on Z agrees well with the trend inferred from
modelling of the dust emission of nearby galaxies using FIR data. We also
present estimates of the variation of the dust-to-metal ratio with Z and show
that this is poorly constrained at Z<~0.5Z_sun. We end with a study of the
inventory of gas in the central regions, defined both in terms of a fixed
physical radius and as a fixed fraction of the half-light radius, of ~70,000
star-forming galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We show that their
central gas content and gas depletion times are not accurately predicted by a
single parameter, but in agreement with recent studies we find that a
combination of the M* and some measure of central concentration provides a good
predictor of gas content in galaxies. We also identify a population of galaxies

two sequences separating younger from older clusters. In addition, the
reddening-free index Qd = (H-Ks) - 0.884 (J-H) has been shown to correlate with
age for the young clusters and thus provided an effective way to differentiate
the embedded clusters from the older ones. We aim to study the behaviour of

0.054\pm0.082\pm0.039, where the uncertainties are statistical and systematic,
respectively. We perform a two-dimensional likelihood scan of the direct
CP-violation asymmetry parameters for B^0 -> rho^\pm pi^\mp decays, finding the
change in chi^2 between the minimum and the origin (corresponding to no direct
CP violation) to be Delta(chi^2)=6.42. We present information on the
CP-violating parameter alpha in a likelihood scan that incorporates B^\pm ->

Frost","Modeling and Analysing Respondent Driven Sampling as a Counting Process","16 pages",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is an approach to sampling design and
analysis which utilizes the networks of social relationships that connect
members of the target population, using chain-referral methods to facilitate
sampling. RDS typically leads to biased sampling, favoring participants with
many acquaintances. Naive estimates, such as the sample average, which are
uncorrected for the sampling bias, will themselves be biased. To compensate for
this bias, current methodology suggests inverse-degree weighting, where the
""degree"" is the number of acquaintances. This stems from the fundamental RDS
assumption that the probability of sampling an individual is proportional to
their degree. Since this assumption is tenuous at best, we propose to harness
the additional information encapsulated in the time of recruitment, into a
model-based inference framework for RDS. This information is typically
collected by researchers, but ignored. We adapt methods developed for inference
in epidemic processes to estimate the population size, degree counts and
frequencies. While providing valuable information in themselves, these
quantities ultimately serve to debias other estimators, such a disease's
prevalence. A fundamental advantage of our approach is that, being model-based,
it makes all assumptions of the data-generating process explicit. This enables
verification of the assumptions, maximum likelihood estimation, extension with
covariates, and model selection. We develop asymptotic theory, proving
consistency and asymptotic normality properties. We further compare these
estimators to the standard inverse-degree weighting through simulations, and
using real-world data. In both cases we find our estimators to outperform
current methods. The likelihood problem in the model we present is convex, and
thus efficiently solvable. We implement these estimators in an R package,
chords, available on CRAN.

direction in the observed CMB sky since it induces an apparent deflection of
the observed CMB photons (aberration) and a shift in their frequency (Doppler).
Both effects distort the multipoles $a_{\ell m}$'s at all $\ell$'s. Such
effects are real as it has been recently measured for the first time by Planck
according to what was forecast in some recent papers. However, the common lore
when estimating a power spectrum from CMB is to consider that Doppler affects
only the $\ell=1$ multipole, neglecting any other corrections. In this work we
use simulations of the CMB sky in a boosted frame with a peculiar velocity
$\beta = v/c = 1.23 \times 10^{-3}$ in order to assess the impact of such
effect on power spectrum estimations in different regions of the sky. We show
that the boost induces a north-south asymmetry in the power spectrum which is
highly significant and non-negligible, of about (0.58 $\pm$ 0.10)% for half-sky
cuts when going up to $\ell$ = 2500. We suggest that these effects are relevant
and may account for some of the north-south asymmetries seen in the Planck
data, being especially important at small scales. Finally we analyze the
particular case of the ACT experiment, which observed only a small fraction of
the sky and show that it suffers a bias of about 1% on the power spectrum and
of similar size on some cosmological parameters: for example the position of
the peaks shifts by 0.5% and the overall amplitude of the spectrum is about
0.4% lower than a full-sky case.

the black hole transient MAXI J1836-194 over state transitions during its
discovery outburst in 2011. A fading of the optical-infrared (IR) flux occurred
as the source entered the hard-intermediate state, followed by a brightening as
it returned to the hard state. The optical-IR spectrum was consistent with a
power law from optically thin synchrotron emission, except when the X-ray
spectrum was softest. By fitting the radio to optical spectra with a broken
power law, we constrain the frequency and flux of the optically thick/thin
break in the jet synchrotron spectrum. The break gradually shifted to higher
frequencies as the source hardened at X-ray energies, from ~ 10^11 to ~ 4 x
10^13 Hz. The radiative jet luminosity integrated over the spectrum appeared to
be greatest when the source entered the hard state during the outburst decay
(although this is dependent on the high energy cooling break, which is not seen
directly), even though the radio flux was fading at the time. The physical
process responsible for suppressing and reactivating the jet (neither of which
are instantaneous but occur on timescales of weeks) is uncertain, but could
arise from the varying inner accretion disk radius regulating the fraction of
accreting matter that is channeled into the jet. This provides an unprecedented
insight into the connection between inflow and outflow, and has implications
for the conditions required for jets to be produced, and hence their launching
process.

To date,
tip-driven growth processes have been modelled as an elongating path or series
of segments without taking into account lateral expansion during elongation.
Instead, models of growth often introduce an explicit thickness by expanding
the area around the completed elongated path. Modelling expansion in this way
can lead to contradictions in the physical plausibility of the resulting
surface and to uncertainty about how the object reached certain regions of
space. Here, we introduce ""fiber walks"" as a self-avoiding random walk model
for tip-driven growth processes that includes lateral expansion. In 2D, the
fiber walk takes place on a square lattice and the space occupied by the fiber
is modelled as a lateral contraction of the lattice. This contraction
influences the possible follow-up steps of the fiber walk. The boundary of the
area consumed by the contraction is derived as the dual of the lattice faces
adjacent to the fiber. We show that fiber walks generate fibers that have
well-defined curvatures, enable the identification of the process underlying
the occupancy of physical space. Hence, fiber walks provide a base from which
to model both the extension and expansion of physical biological objects with
finite thickness.

tapping into the skills of large groups of people. A salient feature of
crowdsourcing---its openness of entry---makes it vulnerable to malicious
behavior. Such behavior took place in a number of recent popular crowdsourcing
competitions. We provide game-theoretic analysis of a fundamental tradeoff
between the potential for increased productivity and the possibility of being
set back by malicious behavior. Our results show that in crowdsourcing
competitions malicious behavior is the norm, not the anomaly---a result
contrary to the conventional wisdom in the area. Counterintuitively, making the
attacks more costly does not deter them but leads to a less desirable outcome.
These findings have cautionary implications for the design of crowdsourcing

alternative to Froggatt-Nielsen models instead of as a solution to the
hierarchy problem. We consider a modified RS framework between the Planck scale
and the GUT scale. This also alleviates constraints from flavour physics.
Fermion masses and mixing angles are fit at the GUT scale. The ranges of the
bulk mass parameters are determined using a $\chi^2$ fit taking in to
consideration the variation in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ parameters. In the hadronic
sector, the heavy top quark requires large bulk mass parameters localising the
right handed top quark close to the IR brane. Two cases of neutrino masses are
considered (a) Planck scale lepton number violation and (b) Dirac neutrino
masses. Contrary to the case of weak scale RS models, both these cases give
reasonable fits to the data, with the Planck scale lepton number violation
fitting slightly better compared to the Dirac case. In the Supersymmetric
version, the fits are not significantly different except for the variation in
$\tan\beta$. If the Higgs superfield and the SUSY breaking spurion are
localized on the same brane then the structure of the sfermion masses are
determined by the profiles of the zero modes of the hypermultiplets in the
bulk. Trilinear terms have the same structure as the Yukawa matrices. The
resultant squark spectrum is around $\sim 2-3 \text{TeV}$ required by the light
Higgs mass to be around 125 GeV and to satisfy the flavour violating
constraints.

for generating high power radiation with nearly transform-limited bandwidth in
soft x-ray region. However, it has been pointed out that the initial seed laser
noise will be amplified by the frequency up-conversion process, which may
degrade the quality of the output radiation produced by a harmonic generation
scheme. In this paper, theoretical and simulation studies for laser phase error
amplification in seeded FEL schemes with slippage effect taken into account are
presented. It is found that, the seed laser imperfection experienced by the
electron beam can be significantly smoothed by the slippage effect in the
modulator when the slippage length is comparable to the laser pulse length.
This smoothing effect allows one to preserve the excellent temporal coherence
of seeded FELs in presence of large laser phase errors. For ultra-short UV seed
lasers with FWHM around 16 fs, the slippage length in a modulator with ~30
undulator periods is typically comparable to the laser width; for longer seed
laser pulses with FWHM around 80 fs, the slippage length can be made comparable
to the laser width using a modulator tuned at the sub-harmonic of the UV seed
laser. Three-dimensional simulations have been carried out for a soft x-ray
facility using seed laser pulses with large frequency chirp and the results
show that the sensitivity of the bandwidth of the seeded FEL to the initial
frequency chirp can be significantly reduced by a proper design of the
modulator such that the slippage length is comparable to the laser width. Our
studies show that the tolerance on laser phase error for generating nearly
transform-limited soft x-ray pulses in seeded FELs is much looser than
previously thought and fully coherent radiation at nanometer wavelength may be
reached with current technologies.

exists a constant $\delta>0$ such that if $(M,hyp)$ is a closed hyperbolic
surface and $h$ another metric on $M$ with $\area(M,h)\leq \delta \area(M,hyp)$
then for every radius $R\geq 1$ the universal cover of $(M,h)$ contains an
$R$-ball with area at least the area of an $R$-ball in the hyperbolic plane.
This positively answers a question of L. Guth for surfaces. We also prove an
analog theorem for graphs.

distributed linear regression problem. In this work we focus on a
diffusion-based adaptive dictionary learning strategy: each node records
observations and cooperates with its neighbors by sharing its local dictionary.
The resulting algorithm corresponds to a distributed block coordinate descent

lower bound for the thickness of stems and bundles. The estimated lamellar

emphasizes the importance of repulsive interactions in polymer crystallization,
which are expected to be responsible for the logarithmic lamellar thickening
and the increase of lamellar thickness with pressure. An expression for the

consequences of the intrinsic properties of the acquisition equipments, and
atmospheric conditions. One of the most frequent defects in astronomical
imaging is the presence of additive noise which makes a denoising step
mandatory before processing data. During the last decade, a particular modeling
scheme, based on sparse representations, has drawn the attention of an ever
growing community of researchers. Sparse representations offer a promising
framework to many image and signal processing tasks, especially denoising and
restoration applications. At first, the harmonics, wavelets, and similar bases
and overcomplete representations have been considered as candidate domains to
seek the sparsest representation. A new generation of algorithms, based on
data-driven dictionaries, evolved rapidly and compete now with the
off-the-shelf fixed dictionaries. While designing a dictionary beforehand leans
on a guess of the most appropriate representative elementary forms and
functions, the dictionary learning framework offers to construct the dictionary
upon the data themselves, which provides us with a more flexible setup to
sparse modeling and allows to build more sophisticated dictionaries. In this
paper, we introduce the Centered Dictionary Learning (CDL) method and we study
its performances for astronomical image denoising. We show how CDL outperforms
wavelet or classic dictionary learning denoising techniques on astronomical
images, and we give a comparison of the effect of these different algorithms on
the photometry of the denoised images.

prognostic value for death, new tumour events, progression and recurrence. The

$3.6 \times 10^{-4}$ after correction for multiple hypothesis tests). This is
driven principally by the methylation data (log-rank p-value of $2.0 \times

demonstrating the value of integrating multiple data types.
  Of particular note is a subtype of 47 patients characterised by very low
levels of methylation. This subtype has very low rates of tumour recurrence and
no new events in 10 years of follow up. We also identify a small gene
expression subtype of 6 patients that shows particularly poor survival
outcomes. Additionally, we note a consensus subtype that showly a highly

effective position measurement of the oscillator. We address how such detection
affects the quantum chaotic evolution in this bipartite system. We
differentiate between single measurement realizations and ensembles of repeated
measurements. In the former case a measurement/decoherence induced localization
effect is encountered, while in the latter this localization is almost
completely absent. This is in marked contrast to numerous earlier works
discussing the quantum-classical correspondence in measured chaotic systems.
This lack of a classical correspondence under relatively strong measurement
induced decoherence is attributed to the inherent quantum nature of the qubit
subsystem and in particular to the quantum correlations between the qubit and

Fe(Se,Te) single crystals. It is found that superconductivity is not enhanced
by annealing under high vacuum (~ 10^(-3) Pa) or by annealing in a sealed
evacuated quartz tube. In a moderate vacuum atmosphere (~ 1 Pa), iron oxide
layers are found to show up on sample surfaces, which would draw excess Fe out
of the crystal. Thus, it is suggested that remanent oxygen effectively works to
remove excess Fe from the matrix of Fe(Se,Te) crystals, resulting improvement
of superconducting transition temperature. Our transport measurements suggest
that the excess Fe scatters the carriers on electron- and hole-type channels in
a different manner. We discuss how the mobility of two types of carriers
correlate with superconductivity. Since both the electron and hole bands are
important for the occurrence of superconductivity, excess Fe would suppress
superconductivity mainly due to strong scattering of electrons.

requires modelling work, which necessitates a theory of technology
substitution. Many, if not most, contemporary modelling approaches for future
technology pathways overlook most aspects of transitions theory, for instance
dimensions of heterogenous investor choices, dynamic rates of diffusion and the
profile of transitions. A significant body of literature however exists that
demonstrates how transitions follow S-shaped diffusion curves or Lotka-Volterra
systems of equations. This framework is used ex-post since timescales can only
be reliably obtained in cases where the transitions have already occurred,
precluding its use for studying cases of interest where nascent innovations in
protective niches await favourable conditions for their diffusion. In
principle, scaling parameters of transitions can, however, be derived from
knowledge of industrial dynamics, technology turnover rates and technology
characteristics. In this context, this paper presents a theory framework for
evaluating the parameterisation of S-shaped diffusion curves for use in
simulation models of technology transitions without the involvement of
historical data fitting, making use of standard demography theory applied to
technology at the unit level. The classic Lotka-Volterra competition system
emerges from first principles from demography theory, its timescales explained
in terms of technology lifetimes and industrial dynamics. The theory is placed
in the context of the multi-level perspective on technology transitions, where
innovation and the diffusion of new socio-technical regimes take a prominent
place, as well as discrete choice theory, the primary theoretical framework for
introducing agent diversity.

This relatively small difference does not rule out gravitational interaction
between the two galaxies. Emission line ratios point to a star-forming, not

  We fit the Cardelli, Clayton & Mathis (CCM) extinction law to the spectra of
individual fibres to derive slope ($R_V$) and normalization ($A_V$). The
normalization agrees with the HST attenuation map and the slope is lower than
the Milky Way relation ($R_V<3.1$), which is likely linked to the spatial
sampling of the disk. We speculate that the values of $R_V$ point to either
coherent ISM structures in the disk larger than usual ($\sim9$ kpc) or higher
starting values of $R_V$, indicative of recent processing of the dust.
  The foreground galaxy is a low stellar mass spiral ($M_* \sim 3 \times 10^9

observed SED properties of smaller galaxies: a lower mean dust temperature, a
high dust-to-stellar mass ratio but relatively little optical attenuation.

model calculations on HMI data, we use both, SP data of original resolution and
scaled down to the resolution of HMI. This allows us to compare the model
results based on data from different instruments and to investigate how a
binning of high-resolution data effects the model outcome. The resulting 3D
magnetic fields are compared in terms of magnetic energy content and magnetic
topology. We find stronger magnetic fields in the SP data, translating into a
higher total magnetic energy of the SP models. The net Lorentz forces of the

substantial differences in the absolute estimates of the magnetic field energy

flux shared by distinct areas. The location and extension of neighboring
connectivity domains differs and the SP model fields tend to be higher and more
vertical. Hence, conclusions about the magnetic connectivity based on

small compared to the differences of the solutions based on data from different

the single site approximation in dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), to include
spatially non-local correlations in quantum many-body simulations of strongly

oder to achieve better convergence with cluster size. The new method, which we
call DCA$^+$, cures the cluster shape dependence problems of the DCA, without
suffering from causality violations of previous attempts to interpolate the
cluster self-energy. A practical approach based on standard inference
techniques is given to deduce the continuous lattice self-energy from an
interpolated cluster self-energy. We study the pseudogap region of a hole-doped
two-dimensional Hubbard model and find that in the DCA$^+$ algorithm, the
self-energy and pseudo-gap temperature $T^*$ converge monotonously with cluster
size. Introduction of a continuous lattice self-energy eliminates artificial
long-rage correlations and thus significantly reduces the sign problem of the
quantum Monte Carlo cluster solver in the DCA$^+$ algorithm compared to the
normal DCA. Simulations with much larger cluster sizes thus become feasible,
which, along with the improved convergence in cluster size, raises hope that
precise extrapolations to the exact infinite cluster size limit can be reached
for other physical quantities as well.

For this reason, they are well suited for quantum communication. However, the
interaction between single photons is negligible under most circumstances.
Realising such an interaction is not only fundamentally fascinating but holds
great potential for emerging technologies. It has recently been shown that even
weak optical nonlinearities between single photons can be used to perform
important quantum communication tasks more efficiently than methods based on
linear optics, which have fundamental limitations. Nonlinear optical effects at
single photon levels in atomic media have been studied and demonstrated but
these are neither flexible nor compatible with quantum communication as they
impose restrictions on photons' wavelengths and bandwidths. Here we use a high
efficiency nonlinear waveguide to observe the sum-frequency generation between
a single photon and a single-photon level coherent state from two independent
sources. The use of an integrated, room-temperature device and telecom
wavelengths makes this approach to photon-photon interaction well adapted to
long distance quantum communication, moving quantum nonlinear optics one step

discord by applying decoherence to just one of them. Secondly, even when

an ergodic average $\ < J\ > = \underset{n\rightarrow\infty}{\lim} \frac1n
\sum_1^n J(u_i,s)$ to the parameter $s$ can be computed via the least squares
sensitivity method. This method solves a constrained least squares problem and
computes an approximation to the desired derivative $d\ < J\ > \over ds$ from
the solution. This paper proves that as the size of the least squares problem
approaches infinity, the computed approximation converges to the true

difficult to determine the analytic structure of arbitrary correlators
analytically. When relying on numerical methods to evaluate the analytic
structure, exact predictions of, e.g., branch point locations (i.e., the

can be derived by Cutkosky's cut rules. However, originally they were derived
in Minkowski space for propagators with real masses and are thus not directly
applicable in Euclidean space and for propagators of a more general form.
Following similar considerations that led Karplus et al., Landau and Cutkosky
more than 50 years ago to the mass summation formula that became known as
Cutkosky's cut rules, we show how the position of branch points can be derived
analytically in Euclidean space from propagators of very general form.

tasks of one-way secret key agreement from common randomness and private
channel coding. For the former task, we show how to use common randomness and
insecure one-way communication to obtain a strongly secure key such that the
key construction has a complexity essentially linear in the blocklength and the
rate at which the key is produced is optimal, i.e., equal to the one-way
secret-key rate. For the latter task, we present a private channel coding
scheme that achieves the secrecy capacity using the condition of strong secrecy
and whose encoding and decoding complexity are again essentially linear in the
blocklength.

expansion of the correlation functions and their equations of motion in powers
of the photon tunneling rate between adjacent cavities, leading to an exact
second order solution for any number of cavities. Our method provides a

spontaneous breaking of chiral (sublattice) symmetry in suspended monolayer
graphene due to electrostatic interaction, which takes into account the
screening of Coulomb potential by electrons on $\sigma$-orbitals. In contrast
to the results of previous numerical simulations with unscreened potential, we
find that suspended graphene is in the conducting phase with unbroken chiral
symmetry. This finding is in agreement with recent experimental results by the
Manchester group \cite{Elias et al, 2011}. Further, by artificially increasing
the interaction strength we demonstrate that suspended graphene is quite close
to the phase transition associated with spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking,
which suggests that fluctuations of chirality and nonperturbative effects might
still be quite important.

observed a gap opening at the Dirac point for films thinner than four quintuple

architecture is argued to reduce the computational cost and required
communication bandwidth by around two orders of magnitude while only giving
negligible information loss in comparison with a naive centralized
implementation. This makes a joint global state estimation feasible for up to a
platoon-sized group of agents. Furthermore, robust and low-cost sensor fusion
for the considered setup, based on state space transformation and
marginalization, is presented. The transformation and marginalization are used

Mechanics"" is presented, which has gained some momentum in recent years. Via
the modeling of a quantum system as a non-equilibrium steady-state maintained
by a permanent throughput of energy from the zero-point vacuum, the quantum is
considered as an emergent system. We implement a specific ""bouncer-walker""
model in the context of an assumed sub-quantum statistical physics, in analogy
to the results of experiments by Couder's group on a classical wave-particle
duality. We can thus give an explanation of various quantum mechanical features
and results on the basis of a ""21st century classical physics"", such as the
appearance of Planck's constant, the Schr\""odinger equation, etc. An essential
result is given by the proof that averaged particle trajectories' behaviors
correspond to a specific type of anomalous diffusion termed ""ballistic""
diffusion on a sub-quantum level. It is further demonstrated both analytically
and with the aid of computer simulations that our model provides explanations
for various quantum effects such as double-slit or n-slit interference. We show
the averaged trajectories emerging from our model to be identical to Bohmian
trajectories, albeit without the need to invoke complex wave functions or any
other quantum mechanical tool. Finally, the model provides new insights into
the origins of entanglement, and, in particular, into the phenomenon of a
""systemic"" nonlocality.

reached by 2020. This would mean that 90% of all people infected with HIV know
their status, 90% of them are on ART and 90% of them will have full viral load
suppression. Here we first estimate the case reproduction number, R0, for
countries in sub-Saharan Africa and for India using data on the rate at which
the prevalence of HIV increased at the start of the epidemic and the life
expectancy of people living with HIV who are not on ART. R0 determines the
magnitude of the control problem, that is to say, the extent to which
transmission must be reduced to eliminate HIV. We show that in sub-Saharan
Africa the median value of R0 is 4.6 and in all but five countries R0 is less
than 6.3. If the 90-90-90 target is reached, 73% of all those living with HIV
will have full viral load suppression. If this is maintained it should
guarantee elimination in 70% of all countries in sub-Saharan Africa and will
reduce R0 to less than 2 in the remaining 12 countries, making elimination easy
to achieve by increasing the availability of other high impact methods of
prevention.

problems in modern cryptography. We investigate this problem using concepts and
methods of algorithmic randomness. In modern cryptography, the random oracle
model is widely used as an imaginary framework in which the security of a
cryptographic scheme is discussed. In the random oracle model, the
cryptographic hash function used in a cryptographic scheme is formulated as a
random variable uniformly distributed over all possibility of the function,
called the random oracle. The main result of this paper is to show that, for
any secure signature scheme in the random oracle model, there exists a specific
computable function which can instantiate the random oracle while keeping the
security originally proved in the random oracle model. In modern cryptography
the generic group model is used also for a similar purpose to the random oracle
model. We show that the same results hold for the generic group model. In the
process of proving the results, we introduce the notion of effective security,
demonstrating the importance of this notion in modern cryptography.

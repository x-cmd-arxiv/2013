accelerating these convolution operations as they are typically the most

practically important specific point-spread functions, algorithmically
efficient sliding window or list processing techniques can be used. In some
constellations this allows faster computation than via the Fourier domain.
Second, as iterations progress, computation of convolutions can be restricted
to subsets of pixels. For moderate thinning rates this can be done with almost
no impact on the reconstruction quality. Both approaches are demonstrated in
the context of Richardson-Lucy deconvolution but are not restricted to this

all times, as it does in absence of retardation (Middleton's theorem). This
remarkable property allows us to develop an analytical treatment. The model
with an exponentially decaying memory kernel is realized in Barkhausen
experiments with eddy-current relaxation, and has previously been shown
numerically to account for the experimentally observed asymmetry of
Barkhausen-pulse shapes. We elucidate another qualitatively new feature: the
breakup of each avalanche of the standard ABBM model into a cluster of
sub-avalanches, sharply delimited for slow relaxation under quasi-static
driving. These conditions are typical for earthquake dynamics. With relaxation
and aftershock clustering, the present model includes important ingredients for
an effective description of earthquakes. We analyze quantitatively the limits
of slow and fast relaxation for stationary driving with velocity v>0. The
v-dependent power-law exponent for small velocities, and the critical driving
velocity at which the particle velocity never vanishes, are modified. We also
analyze non-stationary avalanches following a step in the driving magnetic
field. Analytically, we obtain the mean avalanche shape at fixed size, the
duration distribution of the first sub-avalanche, and the time dependence of
the mean velocity. We propose to study these observables in experiments,

gamma-ray emission of globular cluster, both products of synthetic millisecond

residing in the cluster were summed to produce the magnetospheric component of
cluster emission. Electrons ejected by these pulsars were injected into
synthetic globular cluster environment. Their diffusion and interaction, both,

Proper motions for 128 UKIDSS T dwarfs are presented from a new two epoch LAS

systems: LHS 6176AB, a T8+M4 pair and HD118865AB, a T5.5+F8 pair. Using age
constraints from the primaries and evolutionary models to constrain the radii
we have estimated their physical properties from their bolometric luminosity.
We compare the colours and properties of known benchmark T dwarfs to the latest
model atmospheres and draw two principal conclusions. Firstly, it appears that
the H - [4.5] and J - W2 colours are more sensitive to metallicity than has
previously been recognised, such that differences in metallicity may dominate
over differences in Teff when considering relative properties of cool objects
using these colours. Secondly, the previously noted apparent dominance of young
objects in the late-T dwarf sample is no longer apparent when using the new
model grids and the expanded sample of late-T dwarfs and benchmarks. This is
supported by the apparently similar distribution of late-T dwarfs and
earlier-type T dwarfs on reduced proper motion diagrams that we present.
Finally, we present updated space densities for the late-T dwarfs, and compare
our values to simulation predictions and those from WISE.

the continuous time coverage and the exquisite precision of Spitzer in a 5,400

compelling promise of studying the concept of habitability beyond Earth-like
conditions. In addition, our photometric monitoring will provide invaluable
observations of a large sample of nearby brown dwarfs situated close to the M/L

numerous infrared dark clouds. Two bubbles, N 74 and N 75, each host a star
cluster anchored by a single O9.5V star. We identified 162 young stellar
objects (YSOs) and classify 54 as stage I, 7 stage II, 6 stage III, and 32
ambiguous. We do not detect the classical signposts of triggered SF, i.e.,
star-forming pillars or YSOs embedded within bubble rims. We conclude that
feedback-triggered SF has not occurred in G38.9-0.4. The YSOs are
preferentially coincident with infrared dark clouds. This leads to a strong
correlation between areal YSO mass surface density and gas mass surface density
with a power law slope near 1.3, which closely matches the Schmidt-Kennicutt
Law. The correlation is similar inside and outside the bubbles and may mean
that the SF efficiency is neither enhanced nor supressed in regions potentially
influenced by stellar feedback. This suggests that gas density, regardless of
how it is collected, is a more important driver of SF than stellar feedback.
Larger studies should be able to quantify the fraction of all SF that is
feedback-triggered by determining the fraction SF, feedback-compressed gas
surrounding HII regions relative to that already present in molecular clouds.

studied by angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Experimental band
topography is compared to the calculations using the methods of
Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (KKR) with coherent potential approximation (CPA) and
linearized augmented plane wave with local orbitals (LAPW+LO). The region of
the Gamma point exhibits two hole pockets and a quasiparticle peak close to the
chemical potential with undetectable dispersion. This flat band with mainly dz2
orbital character is formed most likely by the top of the outer hole pocket or
is an evidence of the third hole band. It may cover up to 3 % of the Brillouin
zone volume and should give rise to a Van Hove singularity. Studies performed
for various photon energies indicate that at least one of the hole pockets has
a two-dimensional character. The apparently nondispersing peak at the chemical
potential is clearly visible for 40 eV and higher photon energies, due to an
effect of photoionisation cross section rather than band dimensionality.
Orbital characters calculated by LAPW+LO for stoichiometric FeTe do not reveal
the flat dz2 band but are in agreement with the experiment for the other
dispersions around Gamma in Fe1.03Te0.94S0.06.

fundamental limitations of the sensors. Examples include RF-based ranging

  The main contribution of this paper is twofold. We first show that it is
possible to obtain an analytical bound on the performance of a state estimator
under sensor misdetection occurring stochastically over time in the
environment. We then show how this bound can be used in a sample-based path
planning algorithm to produce a path that trades off accuracy and robustness.
Computational results demonstrate the benefit of the approach and comparisons
are made with the state of the art in path planning under state uncertainty.

for a theory of massive particles coupled to a massless spin two particle. As

At no point of the derivation is any use made of the Einstein-Hilbert action or
the Einstein equations. The intermediate steps involve only on-shell S-matrix
elements which are generated via BCFW recursion relations and unitarity sewing
techniques. The notion of a space-time metric is only introduced at the end of
the calculation where it is extracted by matching the potential determined by
the S-matrix to the geodesic motion of a test particle. Other static
space-times such as Kerr follow in a similar manner. Furthermore, given that
the procedure is action independent and depends only upon the choice of the
representation of the little group, solutions to Yang-Mills (YM) theory can be
generated in the same fashion. Moreover, the squaring relation between the YM
and gravity three point functions shows that the seeds that generate solutions
in the two theories are algebraically related. From a technical standpoint our
methodology can also be utilized to calculate quantities relevant for the
binary inspiral problem more efficiently than the more traditional Feynman

looking for opportunities for the first ever experimental evidence of a
Planck-length quantum property of spacetime. These studies are usually based on
the analysis of some candidate indirect implications of spacetime quantization,
such as a possible curvature of momentum space. Some recent proposals have
raised hope that we might also gain direct experimental access to quantum
properties of spacetime, by finding evidence of limitations to the
measurability of the center-of-mass coordinates of some macroscopic bodies.
However I here observe that the arguments that originally lead to speculating
about spacetime quantization do not apply to the localization of the center of
mass of a macroscopic body. And I also analyze some popular formalizations of
the notion of quantum spacetime, finding that when the quantization of
spacetime is Planckian for the constituent particles then for the composite
macroscopic body the quantization of spacetime is much weaker than Planckian.
These results show that finding evidence of spacetime quantization with studies
of macroscopic bodies is extremely unlikely. And they also raise some
conceptual challenges for theories of mechanics in quantum spacetime, in which
for example free protons and free atoms should feel the effects of spacetime
quantization differently.

amount of velocity dispersion internal to the gas disk is required to match the
observed line widths. We examine a scenario in which the intrinsic velocity
dispersion provides dynamical support to the disk, and determine that the
inferred black hole mass increases by only 6%. Incorporating this effect into

theories in which distributions of energy on a collection of sites evolve by a
master equation with some specified transition rates. We build in only energy
conservation, locality, and the standard thermodynamic requirement that all
states with a given energy are equally likely in equilibrium. In these models,
we investigate the qualitative behavior of the dynamics of the energy
distributions for different choices of the density of states for the individual
sites. For typical field theory densities of states (\log(\rho(E)) ~
E^{\alpha<1}), the model gives diffusive behavior in which initially localized
distributions of energy spread out relatively quickly. For large N gauge
theories with gravitational duals, the density of states for a finite volume of
field theory degrees of freedom typically includes a Hagedorn regime
(\log(\rho(E)) ~ E). We find that this gives rise to a trapping of energy in
subsets of degrees of freedom for parametrically long time scales before the
energy leaks away. We speculate that this Hagedorn trapping may be part of a
holographic explanation for long-lived gravitational bound states (black holes)
in gravitational theories.

the UKIDSS Ultra-Deep Survey (UDSz). The galaxies have an average stellar mass
of ~10^9.5 solar masses and span a wide range in rest-frame colours,
representing typical star-forming galaxies at this epoch. We stack the spectra
by various galaxy properties, including stellar mass, [OII] equivalent width,
star-formation rate, specific star-formation rate and rest-frame spectral
indices. We find that outflows are present in virtually all spectral stacks,
with velocities ranging from 100-1000 km s^-1, indicating that large-scale
outflowing winds are a common property at these redshifts. The highest velocity
outflows (>500 km s^-1) are found in galaxies with the highest stellar masses
and the youngest stellar populations. Our findings suggest that high velocity
galactic outflows are mostly driven by star-forming processes rather than AGN,
with implied mass outflow rates comparable to the rates of star formation. Such
behaviour is consistent with models required to reproduce the high-redshift
mass-metallicity relation.

Resonance Imaging (MRI) features, we consider two important and related tasks
in biomedical research: i)to select genetic and phenotypical markers for

phenotypical data. These two tasks are tightly coupled because underlying
associations between genetic variations and phenotypical features contain the
biological basis for a disease. While a variety of sparse models have been
applied for disease diagnosis and canonical correlation analysis and its
extensions have bee widely used in association studies (e.g., eQTL analysis),
these two tasks have been treated separately. To unify these two tasks, we
present a new sparse Bayesian approach for joint association study and disease
diagnosis. In this approach, common latent features are extracted from
different data sources based on sparse projection matrices and used to predict
multiple disease severity levels based on Gaussian process ordinal regression;
in return, the disease status is used to guide the discovery of relationships
between the data sources. The sparse projection matrices not only reveal
interactions between data sources but also select groups of biomarkers related
to the disease. To learn the model from data, we develop an efficient
variational expectation maximization algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate
that our approach achieves higher accuracy in both predicting ordinal labels
and discovering associations between data sources than alternative methods. We
apply our approach to an imaging genetics dataset for the study of Alzheimer's

Observations of the ground-state CO J=1-0 line have furnished crucial

dynamical mass and size estimates. Detailed studies of rotational ladders of CO
have provided insight on the temperature and density of the gas. Investigations
of the very dense gas associated with actively star-forming regions in the

better understanding of the nature of the extreme starbursts found in many
high-redshift galaxies, which exceed the star formation rates of their most
active present-day counterparts by an order of magnitude. Key progress in this
area has been made through targeted studies of few, well-selected systems with

philosophical and scientific thought. Within this intellectual frame, the
knowledge of the ""saros cycle"" (a cycle of 18 years, 10 or 11 days and 1/3 of a
day that separates two successive sun or moon eclipses of similar features),
inherited by the Greeks from the Babylonians, favored important theoretical
developments in the West. The purpose of this paper is to present, briefly and
schematically, a) the ancient theorizations on the causes of eclipses, b) the
range of predictability of eclipses in Antiquity, c) the warnings -transmitted
by some classical writers- to those who want to observe in naked eyes a solar
eclipse, and d) the popular beliefs and social practices upon the occurrence of
unexpected eclipses in ancient times.

fluid, in the three dimensional Euclidean space, at zero temperature. The point
particles, immersed in a uniform ""neutralizing"" background, interact with a
pair-potential which can be continuously changed from zero to the Coulomb
potential depending on a parameter $\mu$. We determine the radial distribution
functions of the system for various values of density, $\mu$, and polarization.
We discuss about the importance, in a computer experiment, of the choice of
suitable estimators to measure a physical quantity. The radial distribution
function is determined through the usual histrogram estimator and through an
estimator determined via the use of the Hellmann and Feynman theorem. In a
diffusion Monte Carlo simulation the latter route introduces a new bias to the
measure of the radial distribution function due to the choice of the auxiliary
function. This bias is independent from the usual one due to the choice of the
trial wave function. A brief account of the results from this study were
presented in a recent communication [R. Fantoni, Solid State Communications,

point vortex system is discussed. A kinetic equation for the system with
positive and negative vortices is derived using the Klimontovich formalism.
Similar to the Fokker-Planck collision term, the obtained collision term
consists of a diffusion term and a drift term. It is revealed that the
mechanism for the self-organization in the 2D point vortex system at negative
absolute temperature is mainly provided by the drift term. Positive and
negative vortices are driven toward opposite directions respectively by the
drift term. As a result, well-known, two isolated clumps with positive and
negative vortices, respectively, are formed as an equilibrium distribution.
Regardless of the number of species of the vortices, either single- or
double-sign, it is found that the collision term has following physically good
properties: (i) When the system reaches a quasi-stationary state near the
thermal equilibrium state with negative absolute temperature, the sign of $d
\omega / d \psi$ is expected to be positive, where $\omega$ is the vorticity
and $\psi$ is the stream function. In this case, the diffusion term decreases
the mean field energy, while the drift term increases it. As a whole, the total
mean field energy is conserved. (ii) Similarly, the diffusion term increases
the Boltzmann entropy, while the drift term decreases it. As a whole, the total
entropy production rate is positive or zero ($H$ theorem), which ensures that
the system relaxes to the global thermal equilibrium state characterized by the
zero entropy production.

small dimension relative to the characteristic of the ground field, then the

destination with the help of several layers of relays. Recent work has shown
that a compress-and-forward based strategy at the relays can achieve the
capacity of this network within an additive gap. In this strategy, the relays
quantize their observations at the noise level and map it to a random Gaussian
codebook. The resultant capacity gap is independent of the SNR's of the
channels in the network but linear in the total number of nodes.
  In this paper, we show that if the relays quantize their signals at a
resolution decreasing with the number of nodes in the network, the additive gap
to capacity can be made logarithmic in the number of nodes for a class of
layered, time-varying wireless relay networks. This suggests that the
rule-of-thumb to quantize the received signals at the noise level used for
compress-and-forward in the current literature can be highly suboptimal.

$D_\mathrm{A}$. Two parameterizations, $\tau(z)=2\epsilon z$ and
$\tau(z)=(1+z)^{2\epsilon}-1$ are adopted for the optical depth associated to
the cosmic absorption. We find that, an almost transparent universe is favored
by Filippis {\it et al.} sample but it is only marginally accommodated by
Bonomente {\it et al.} samples at 95.4% confidence level (C. L.) (even at 99.7%
C. L. when the $r<100 \mathrm{kpc}$-cut spherical $\beta$ model is considered).
Taking the possible cosmic absorption (in 68.3% C. L. range) constrained from
the model-independent tests into consideration, we correct the distance modulus
of SNe Ia and then use them to study their cosmological implications. The
constraints on the $\Lambda$CDM show that a decelerating expanding universe
with $\Omega_\Lambda=0$ is only allowed at 99.7% C. L. by observations when the
Bonamente {\it et al.} sample is considered. Therefore, our analysis suggests
that an accelerated cosmic expansion is still needed to account for the dimming
of SNe and the standard cosmological scenario remains to be supported by
current observations.

in chiral magnets without spatial inversion symmetry. The dynamics of a
skyrmion is equivalent to an electron moving in a strong magnetic field. As a
skyrmion involves large number of spins, it is not clear whether there exist
observable quantum effects. In this work, we study the quantum dynamics of a
skyrmion in a pinning potential. Without a pinning potential, the skyrmion
performs cyclotron motion due to the strong emergent magnetic field originating
from the Berry phase of spins, and all skyrmions occupy the lowest Landau
level. Their wave functions are strongly localized in a region with radius less
than $1\ \AA$ when no driving force is applied. Thus in most circumstances, the
quantum effects of a skyrmion are weak. In the presence of a pinning potential,
the lowest Landau level for skyrmions is split into quantized levels,
characterized by the orbital moments. The transition between quantized levels
can be observed experimentally by microwave absorption measurements in low
temperature region. The quantum effects are more prominent for a skyrmion with
a small size, which can be realized in magnets with a large
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.

and Field Theories held at the Centre for Mathematics of the University of
Notre Dame, Indiana, from May 29 to June 2, 2012. The idea of extending quantum
field theories to manifolds of lower dimension was first proposed by Dan Freed
in the nineties. In the case of conformal field theory (CFT), we are talking of
an extension of the Atiyah-Segal axioms, where one replaces the bordism
category of Riemann surfaces by a suitable bordism bicategory, whose ob jects
are points, whose morphisms are 1-manifolds, and whose 2-morphisms are pieces
of Riemann surface. There is a beautiful classification of full (rational) CFTs
due to Fuchs, Runkel and Schweigert, which roughly says the following. Fix a
chiral algebra A (= vertex algebra). Then the set of full cfts whose left and
right chiral algebras agree with A is classified by Frobenius algebras internal
to Rep(A). A famous example to which one can successfully apply this is the
case where the chiral algebra A is affine su(2) at level k, for some k in N. In
that case, the Frobenius algebras in Rep (A) are classified by A_n, D_n, E_6,
E_7, E_8, and so are the corresponding CFTs. Recently, Kapustin and Saulina
gave a conceptual interpretation of the FRS classification in terms of
3-dimensional Chern-Simons theory with defects. Those defects are also given by
Frobenius algebra ob ject in Rep(A). Inspired by the proposal of Kapustin and
Saulina, we will (partially) construct the three-tier CFT associated to a
Frobenius algebra object.

the naked singularity is much more luminous than one around an equivalent black
hole. Also, the disk around the naked singularity has a spectrum with a high
frequency power law segment that carries a major fraction of the total
luminosity. Thus, at least some naked singularities can, in principle, be

action by generalizing the multiscale enhanced sampling (MSES) technique
suggested by Moritsugu and coworkers (J. Chem. Phys. 133, 224105 (2010)). The
basic idea of this method is that the system we want to study (for example,
some molecular system described by molecular mechanics) is coupled to a
coarse-grained (CG) system, which can move more quickly and computed more
efficiently than the original system. We simulate this combined system
(original + CG system) using (underdamped) Langevin dynamics where different
heat baths are coupled to the two systems. When the coupling is strong enough,
the original system is guided by the CG system, and able to sample the
configuration and path space more efficiency. We need to correct the bias
caused by the coupling, however, by employing the Hamiltonian replica exchange
where we prepare many path replica with different coupling strengths. As a
result, an unbiased path ensemble for the original system can be found in the
weakest coupling path ensemble. This strategy is easily implemented because a
weight for a path calculated by the OM action is formally the same as the
Boltzmann weight if we properly define the path ""Hamiltonian"". We apply this
method to a model polymer with Asakura-Oosawa interaction, and compare the
results with the conventional transition path sampling method.

settings. In this paper, we consider Gaussian networks where sources and
destinations can communicate with the help of intermediate relays over multiple
hops. We assume that links in the network can be bidirected providing
opportunities for feedback. We ask the following question: can the information
transfer in both directions of a link be critical to maximizing the end-to-end
communication rates in the network? Equivalently, could one of the directions
in each bidirected link (and more generally at least one of the links forming a
cycle) be shut down and the capacity of the network still be approximately
maintained? We show that in any arbitrary Gaussian network with bidirected
edges and cycles and unicast traffic, we can always identify a directed acyclic
subnetwork that approximately maintains the capacity of the original network.
For Gaussian networks with multiple-access and broadcast traffic, an acyclic
subnetwork is sufficient to achieve every rate point in the capacity region of
the original network, however, there may not be a single acyclic subnetwork
that maintains the whole capacity region. For networks with multicast and
multiple unicast traffic, on the other hand, bidirected information flow across
certain links can be critically needed to maximize the end-to-end capacity
region. These results can be regarded as generalizations of the conclusions
regarding the usefulness of feedback in various single-hop Gaussian settings
and can provide opportunities for simplifying operation in Gaussian multi-hop
networks.

variations of solar-type stars showing superflares, by using Kepler photometric

the typical period of one to a few tens of days. Our results indicate that
these brightness variations of superflare stars can be explained by the
rotation of the star with fairly large starspots. Using the result of the
period analysis, we investigated the relation between the energy and frequency
of superflares and the rotation period. Stars with relatively slower rotation
rates can still produce flares that are as energetic as those of more rapidly
rotating stars, although the average flare frequency is lower for more slowly
rotating stars. We found that the energy of superflares are related to the
total coverage of starspots. The correlation between the spot coverage and the
flare energy in superflares is similar to that in solar flares. These results
suggest that the energy of superflares can be explained by the magnetic energy
stored around starspots.

connections combined with nearly minimal wiring costs. However the growth rules
shaping these economical trade-offs between cost and topology are not well
understood. Here we study the cellular nervous system of the nematode worm C.
elegans, together with information on the birth times of neurons and on their
spatial locations. We find that the growth of this network undergoes a
transition from an accelerated to a constant increase in the number of links
(synaptic connections) as a function of the number of nodes (neurons). The time
of this phase transition coincides closely with the observed moment of
hatching, when development switches metamorphically from oval to larval stages.
We use graph analysis and generative modelling to show that the transition
between different growth regimes, as well as its coincidence with the moment of
hatching, can be explained by a dynamic economical model which incorporates a
trade-off between topology and cost that is continuously negotiated and
re-negotiated over developmental time. As the body of the animal progressively
elongates, the cost of longer distance connections is increasingly penalised.
This growth process regenerates many aspects of the adult nervous system's
organization, including the neuronal membership of anatomically pre-defined
ganglia. We expect that similar economical principles can be found in the
development of other biological or man-made spatially-embedded complex systems.

make a transition to sleep state when required. When the processor is operating
at a speed $s$, the energy consumed per unit time is given by a convex power
function $P(s)$ having the property that $P(0) > 0$ and $P""(s) > 0$ for all
values of $s$. Moreover, $C > 0$ units of energy is required to make a
transition from the sleep state to the active state. The jobs are specified by
their arrival time, deadline and the processing volume.
  We consider a scheduling problem, called speed scaling with sleep state,
where each job has to be scheduled within their arrival time and deadline, and
the goal is to minimize the total energy consumption required to process these
jobs. Albers et. al. proved the NP-hardness of this problem by reducing an
instance of an NP-hard partition problem to an instance of this scheduling
problem. The instance of this scheduling problem consists of the arrival time,
the deadline and the processing volume for each of the jobs, in addition to $P$
and $C$. Since $P$ and $C$ depend on the instance of the partition problem,
this proof of the NP-hardness of the speed scaling with sleep state problem
doesn't remain valid when $P$ and $C$ are fixed. In this paper, we prove that
the speed scaling with sleep state problem remains NP-hard for any fixed

libration of the resonant angles was not seen, the system is affected by the
presence of the resonance and could yet occupy the 7:5 commensurability, which
would be the first planetary configuration in such a dynamical resonance. Given
the multitude of low-mass multiplanet systems that will be discovered in the

particular, it is of interest to find a pre-processing operation that enables
computationally efficient near-optimal post-processing. An invertible
linear-conjugate linear (LCL) operator named the DT FREquency Shift (FRESH)
properizer is first proposed. It is shown that the DT FRESH properizer converts
a DT improper-complex SOCS random process input to an equivalent DT
proper-complex SOCS random process output by utilizing the information only
about the cycle period of the input. An invertible LCL block processing
operator named the asymptotic FRESH properizer is then proposed that mimics the
operation of the DT FRESH properizer but processes a finite number of
consecutive samples of a DT improper-complex SOCS random process. It is shown
that the output of the asymptotic FRESH properizer is not proper but
asymptotically proper and that its frequency-domain covariance matrix converges
to a highly-structured block matrix with diagonal blocks as the block size
tends to infinity. Two representative estimation and detection problems are
presented to demonstrate that asymptotically optimal low-complexity
post-processors can be easily designed by exploiting these asymptotic
second-order properties of the output of the asymptotic FRESH properizer.

underground laboratories, is in a unique position to study muon-induced
backgrounds in an organic liquid scintillator. In this study, a large sample of
cosmic muons is identified and tracked by a muon veto detector external to the
liquid scintillator, and by the specific light patterns observed when muons
cross the scintillator volume. The yield of muon-induced neutrons is found to
be Yn =(3.10+-0.11)10-4 n/({\mu} (g/cm2)). The distance profile between the
parent muon track and the neutron capture point has the average value {\lambda}
= (81.5 +- 2.7)cm. Additionally the yields of a number of cosmogenic
radioisotopes are measured for 12N, 12B, 8He, 9C, 9Li, 8B, 6He, 8Li, 11Be, 10C
and 11C. All results are compared with Monte Carlo simulation predictions using
the Fluka and Geant4 packages. General agreement between data and simulation is
observed for the cosmogenic production yields with a few exceptions, the most
prominent case being 11C yield for which both codes return about 50% lower
values. The predicted {\mu}-n distance profile and the neutron multiplicity
distribution are found to be overall consistent with data.

of L-histidine crystals at low temperatures. The temperature dependence of the
spectra show discontinuities at 165 K, which we identify with modifications in
the bonds associated to both the NH3+ and CO2- motifs indicative of a
conformational phase transition that changes the intermolecular bonds.
Additional evidence of such a phase transition was provided by differential
scanning calorimetry measurements, which identified an enthalpic anomaly at
~165 K.

together with the corresponding infinitesimal objects, so-called

this theory to to formulation of a new concept of loop of boosts. A
quaternionic model of the three-parametric loop of boosts is obtained and a
remarkable connection with geodesic loops of Lobachevskii space is found. A
description of Thomas precession in the light of general theory of smooth loops
is given.

quantum anomalous-Hall state with Chern number C=2. We find that through tuning
Rashba spin-orbit coupling, a topological phase transition gives rise to a
valley polarized quantum anomalous Hall state, i.e. a quantum state which
exhibits electronic properties of both quantum valley-Hall effect (valley Chern
number C_V=3) and quantum anomalous Hall effect with C=-1.

coordination number of the adsorbed carbon. We show this using the five fold
symmetry of a pentagonal pyramid of an icosahedron. Initial zigzag structure
from nucleation sites results in formation of hexagons and pentagons that
result in anomalous cap formation. Possible cap lift off mechanism is
discussed.

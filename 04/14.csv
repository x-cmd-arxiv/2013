component of the Survey of the Ensemble Physical Properties of Cometary Nuclei.
We show that the survey is well suited to measuring the activity of
Jupiter-family comets at 3-7 AU from the Sun. Dust was detected in 33 of 89
targets (37 +/- 6%), and we conclude that 21 comets (24 +/- 5%) have
morphologies that suggest ongoing or recent cometary activity. Our dust
detections are sensitivity limited, therefore our measured activity rate is
necessarily a lower limit. All comets with small perihelion distances (q < 1.8
AU) are inactive in our survey, and the active comets in our sample are
strongly biased to post-perihelion epochs. We introduce the quantity
epsilon-f-rho, intended to be a thermal emission counterpart to the often
reported A-f-rho, and find that the comets with large perihelion distances
likely have greater dust production rates than other comets in our survey at
3-7 AU from the Sun, indicating a bias in the discovered Jupiter-family comet
population. By examining the orbital history of our survey sample, we suggest
that comets perturbed to smaller perihelion distances in the past 150 yr are
more likely to be active, but more study on this effect is needed.

(OSN) services protects both OSN operators and OSN users from illegal
exploitation. Existing social-graph-based defense schemes effectively bound the
accepted Sybils to the total number of social connections between Sybils and
non-Sybil users. However, Sybils may still evade the defenses by soliciting
many social connections to real users. We propose SybilFence, a system that
improves over social-graph-based Sybil defenses to further thwart Sybils.
SybilFence is based on the observation that even well-maintained fake accounts
inevitably receive a significant number of user negative feedback, such as the
rejections to their friend requests. Our key idea is to discount the social
edges on users that have received negative feedback, thereby limiting the
impact of Sybils' social edges. The preliminary simulation results show that
our proposal is more resilient to attacks where fake accounts continuously
solicit social connections over time.

communicates with a destination decoder through a number of out-of-band relays
that are connected to the decoder through capacity-constrained digital backhaul
links. This model is motivated by the uplink of cloud radio access networks. In
this scenario, a novel transmission and relaying strategies are proposed in
which multi-layer transmission is used, on the one hand, to adaptively leverage
the different decoding capabilities of the relays and, on the other hand, to
enable hybrid decode-and-forward (DF) and compress-and-forward (CF) relaying.
The hybrid relaying strategy allows each relay to forward part of the decoded
messages and a compressed version of the received signal to the decoder. The
problem of optimizing the power allocation across the layers and the
compression test channels is formulated. Albeit non-convex, the derived problem
is found to belong to the class of so called complementary geometric programs
(CGPs). Using this observation, an iterative algorithm based on the homotopy
method is proposed that achieves a stationary point of the original problem by
solving a sequence of geometric programming (GP), and thus convex, problems.
Numerical results are provided that show the effectiveness of the proposed
multi-layer hybrid scheme in achieving performance close to a theoretical

different biological systems. Although the core molecular machinery for actin
network growth is well preserved in most cases, the geometry of the propelled
obstacle can vary considerably. In recent years, filament orientation
distribution has emerged as an important observable characterizing the
structure and dynamical state of the growing network. Here we derive several
continuum equations for the orientation distribution of filaments growing
behind stiff obstacles of various shapes and validate the predicted steady
state orientation patterns by stochastic computer simulations based on discrete
filaments. We use an ordinary differential equation approach to demonstrate
that for flat obstacles of finite size, two fundamentally different orientation
patterns peaked at either +35/-35 or +70/0/-70 degrees exhibit mutually
exclusive stability, in agreement with earlier results for flat obstacles of
very large lateral extension. We calculate and validate phase diagrams as a
function of model parameters and show how this approach can be extended to
obstacles with piecewise straight contours. For curved obstacles, we arrive at
a partial differential equation in the continuum limit, which again is in good
agreement with the computer simulations. In all cases, we can identify the same
two fundamentally different orientation patterns, but only within an
appropriate reference frame, which is adjusted to the local orientation of the
obstacle contour. Our results suggest that two fundamentally different network
architectures compete with each other in growing actin networks, irrespective
of obstacle geometry, and clarify how simulated and electron tomography data
have to be analyzed for non-flat obstacle geometries.

picture, dark energy is characterized by a barotropic fluid on a lattice in the
equilibrium configuration. Thus, mimicking the spin interaction by replacing
the spin variable with an occupational number, the pressure naturally becomes
negative. We find that the corresponding equation of state mimics the effects
of a variable dark energy term, whose limiting case reduces to the cosmological
constant $\Lambda$. This permits us to avoid the introduction of a vacuum
energy as dark energy source by hand, alleviating the coincidence and fine
tuning problems. We find fairly good cosmological constraints, by performing
three tests with supernovae Ia, baryonic acoustic oscillation and cosmic
microwave background measurements. Finally, we perform the AIC and BIC
selection criteria, showing that our model is statistically favored with
respect to the CPL parametrization.

The gravity dual of a finite density fermion system is a Dirac field in the
background of the dyonic AdS-Reissner-Nordstrom black hole. In the probe limit
the magnetic system can be reduced to the non-magnetic one, with
Landau-quantized momenta and rescaled thermodynamical variables. We find that
at strong enough magnetic fields, the Fermi surface vanishes and the
quasiparticle is lost either through a crossover to conformal regime or through
a phase transition to an unstable Fermi surface. In the latter case, the
vanishing Fermi velocity at the critical magnetic field triggers the non-Fermi
liquid regime with unstable quasiparticles and a change in transport properties
of the system. We associate it with a metal-""strange metal"" phase transition.
  We compute the DC Hall and longitudinal conductivities using the
gravity-dressed fermion propagators. As expected, the Hall conductivity is
quantized according to integer Quantum Hall Effect (QHE) at weak magnetic
fields. At strong magnetic fields, new plateaus typical for the fractional QHE
appear. Our pattern closely resembles the experimental results on graphite
which are described using the fractional filling factor proposed by Halperin.

the condition of interest may be prohibitively expensive. For example, the
""gold standard"" for diagnosing temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is a physical
examination by a trained clinician. In large studies, examining all
participants in this manner is infeasible. Instead, it is common to use
questionnaires to screen for incidence of TMD and perform the ""gold standard""
examination only on participants who screen positively. Unfortunately, some
participants may leave the study before receiving the ""gold standard""
examination. Within the framework of survival analysis, this results in missing
failure indicators. Motivated by the Orofacial Pain: Prospective Evaluation and
Risk Assessment (OPPERA) study, a large cohort study of TMD, we propose a
method for parameter estimation in survival models with missing failure
indicators. We estimate the probability of being an incident case for those
lacking a ""gold standard"" examination using logistic regression. These
estimated probabilities are used to generate multiple imputations of case
status for each missing examination that are combined with observed data in
appropriate regression models. The variance introduced by the procedure is
estimated using multiple imputation. The method can be used to estimate both
regression coefficients in Cox proportional hazard models as well as incidence
rates using Poisson regression. We simulate data with missing failure
indicators and show that our method performs as well as or better than
competing methods. Finally, we apply the proposed method to data from the

semi-Supervised. Such type of learning combines unlabeled and labeled data
which are hard to obtain. However, in unsupervised methods, the only unlabeled
data are used. The problem of significance and the effectiveness of
semi-supervised clustering results is becoming of main importance. This paper
pursues the thesis that muchgreater accuracy can be achieved in such clustering
by improving the similarity computing. Hence, we introduce a new approach of
semisupervised clustering using an innovative new homogeneity measure of
generated clusters. Our experimental results demonstrate significantly improved
accuracy as a result.

practice in language research. However, the empirical distribution of
dependency lengths of sentences of the same length differs from that of
sentences of varying length and the distribution of dependency lengths depends
on sentence length for real sentences and also under the null hypothesis that
dependencies connect vertices located in random positions of the sequence. This
suggests that certain results, such as the distribution of syntactic dependency
lengths mixing dependencies from sentences of varying length, could be a mere
consequence of that mixing. Furthermore, differences in the global averages of
dependency length (mixing lengths from sentences of varying length) for two
different languages do not simply imply a priori that one language optimizes
dependency lengths better than the other because those differences could be due
to differences in the distribution of sentence lengths and other factors.

specifically, the focus is Gaussian fading channel with a BPSK modulation
technique, where the equivalent channel could be modeled as a binary symmetric
channel with varying cross-over probabilities. To deal with variable channel
states, a coding scheme of hierarchically utilizing polar codes is proposed. In
particular, by observing the polarization of different binary symmetric
channels over different fading blocks, each channel use corresponding to a
different polarization is modeled as a binary erasure channel such that polar
codes could be adopted to encode over blocks. It is shown that the proposed
coding scheme, without instantaneous channel state information at the

channel, which is constructed from the underlying fading AWGN channel through
the modulation scheme.

argue that ambiguities are in principle no worse than more familiar remotely

benefit from simultaneous observations of EUV lines. Based on calculations and
data from eclipses, we discuss the most promising lines and different

traffic. We are given a graph, g groups of terminals, and a universe of data
packets. Each group of terminals desires a subset of the packets from its
respective source. The cost of routing traffic on any edge in the network is
proportional to the total size of the distinct packets that the edge carries.
Our goal is to find a minimum cost routing. We focus on two settings. In the
first, the collection of packet sets desired by source-sink pairs is laminar.
For this setting, we present a primal-dual based 2-approximation, improving
upon a logarithmic approximation due to Barman and Chawla (2012). In the second
setting, packet sets can have non-trivial intersection. We focus on the case
where each packet is desired by either a single terminal group or by all of the
groups, and the graph is unweighted. For this setting we present an O(log
g)-approximation.
  Our approximation for the second setting is based on a novel spanner-type
construction in unweighted graphs that, given a collection of g vertex subsets,
finds a subgraph of cost only a constant factor more than the minimum spanning
tree of the graph, such that every subset in the collection has a Steiner tree
in the subgraph of cost at most O(log g) that of its minimum Steiner tree in
the original graph. We call such a subgraph a group spanner.

field, helical kinetic forcing was applied to the magnetohydrodynamic(MHD)
system that had a specific distribution of energy and helicity as initial
conditions. Simulation results show the saturation of a system is not
influenced by the initial conditions, but the growth rate of large scale
magnetic field is proportionally dependent on the initial large scale magnetic
energy and helicity. It is already known that the helical component of small
scale magnetic field(i.e., current helicity $<{\bf j}\cdot {\bf b}>$) quenches
the growth of large scale magnetic field. However, $<{\bf j}\cdot {\bf b}>$ can
also boost the growth of large scale magnetic field by changing its sign and
magnitude. In addition, simulation shows the nonhelical magnetic field can

of evolving magnetic and kinetic energy indicates that kinetic energy migrates
backward when the external energy flows into the three dimensional MHD system,
which means the velocity field may play a preceding role in the very early MHD

(SA-STAP) algorithms with $l_1$-norm regularization for airborne phased-array
radar applications. The proposed SA-STAP algorithms suppose that a number of
samples of the full-rank STAP data cube are not meaningful for processing and
the optimal full-rank STAP filter weight vector is sparse, or nearly sparse.
The core idea of the proposed method is imposing a sparse regularization
($l_1$-norm type) to the minimum variance (MV) STAP cost function. Under some
reasonable assumptions, we firstly propose a $l_1$-based sample matrix
inversion (SMI) to compute the optimal filter weight vector. However, it is
impractical due to its matrix inversion, which requires a high computational
cost when in a large phased-array antenna. Then, we devise lower complexity
algorithms based on conjugate gradient (CG) techniques. A computational
complexity comparison with the existing algorithms and an analysis of the
proposed algorithms are conducted. Simulation results with both simulated and
the Mountain Top data demonstrate that fast
signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) convergence and good performance
of the proposed algorithms are achieved.

on noisy measurements. This is, of course, a central question in problems
involving ""Big Data."" Often a key assumption is that measurement errors in each
variable are independent. This precise formulation has its roots in the work of
Charles Spearman in 1904 and of Ragnar Frisch in the 1930's. Various topics
such as errors-in-variables, factor analysis, and instrumental variables, all
refer to alternative formulations of the problem of how to account for the
anticipated way that noise enters in the data. In the present paper we begin by
describing the basic theory and provide alternative modern proofs to some key
results. We then go on to consider certain generalizations of the theory as
well applying certain novel numerical techniques to the problem. A central role
is played by the Frisch-Kalman dictum which aims at a noise contribution that
allows a maximal set of simultaneous linear relations among the noise-free
variables --a rank minimization problem. In the years since Frisch's original
formulation, there have been several insights including trace minimization as a
convenient heuristic to replace rank minimization. We discuss convex
relaxations and certificates guaranteeing global optimality. A complementary
point of view to the Frisch-Kalman dictum is introduced in which models lead to
a min-max quadratic estimation error for the error-free variables. Points of
contact between the two formalisms are discussed and various alternative
regularization schemes are indicated.

(LCPs) that have been randomly, permanently cross-linked in the
high-temperature state so as to form an equilibrium random solid. Thus, instead
of being free to diffuse throughout the entire volume, as they would be in the
liquid state, the constituent LCPs in an IGNE are mobile only over a finite
length-scale controlled by the density of cross-links. We address the effects
that such network-induced localization have on the liquid-crystalline
characteristics of an IGNE, as probed via measurements made at high
temperatures. In contrast with the case of uncross-linked LCPs, for IGNEs these
characteristics are determined not only by thermal fluctuations but also by the
quenched disorder associated with the cross-link constraints. To study IGNEs,
we consider a microscopic model of dimer nematogens in which the dimers
interact via orientation-dependent excluded volume forces. The dimers are,
furthermore, randomly, permanently cross-linked via short Hookean springs, the
statistics of which we model by means of a Deam-Edwards type of distribution.
We show that at length-scales larger than the size of the nematogens this
approach leads to a recently proposed phenomenological Landau theory of IGNEs
[Lu et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 257803 (2012)], and hence predicts a regime
of short-ranged oscillatory spatial correlations in the nematic alignment, of
both thermal and glassy types. In addition, we consider two alternative
microscopic models of IGNEs: (i) a wormlike chain model of IGNEs that are
formed via the cross-linking of side-chain LCPs; and (ii) a jointed chain model
of IGNEs that are formed via the cross-linking of main-chain LCPs. At large
length-scales, both of these models give rise to liquid-crystalline
characteristics that are qualitatively in line with those predicted by the
dimer-and-springs model.

there are two groups of SNRs bright in [Fe II] emission: middle-aged SNRs
interacting with molecular clouds and young core-collapse SNRs in dense
circumstellar medium. The SNRs belonging to the former group are also bright in
near-infrared H$_2$ emission, indicating that both atomic and molecular shocks
are pervasive in these SNRs. The SNRs belonging to the latter group have
relatively small radii in general, implying that most of them are likely the

the mid- and far-infrared regimes, thermal dust emission is dominant. The dust
in SNRs can be heated either by collisions with gas species in a hot plasma or
by radiation from a shock front. I discuss the characteristics of the infrared

associated with the SLGM, we derive novel lower bounds on the minimum variance
achievable by estimators with a prescribed bias function. This includes the
important case of unbiased estimation. The variance bounds are obtained via an
orthogonal projection of the prescribed mean function onto a subspace of the
RKHS associated with the SLGM. Furthermore, we specialize our bounds to
compressed sensing measurement matrices and express them in terms of the
restricted isometry and coherence parameters. For the special case of the SLGM
given by the sparse signal in noise model (SSNM), we derive closed-form
expressions of the minimum achievable variance (Barankin bound) and the
corresponding locally minimum variance estimator. We also analyze the effects
of exact and approximate sparsity information and show that the minimum
achievable variance for exact sparsity is not a limiting case of that for
approximate sparsity. Finally, we compare our bounds with the variance of three

research programme known as ""cosmical physics"" attracted much scientific and

magnetic storms and atmospheric electricity) combined with astronomical
subjects (such as the solar corona and cometary tails), but there was no
unanimity as to the precise meaning of cosmical physics, which collapsed after
World War I. The essay covers the history of cosmical physics as it unfolded in
particular in Germany, Austria, England and Scandinavia. Among the scientists
who contributed to the development of cosmical physics were Wilhelm Foerster
from Germany, Wilhelm Trabert from Austria, Kristian Birkeland from Norway and
Svante Arrhenius from Sweden. While cosmical physics did not usually involve a
cosmological dimension, both Birkeland and Arrhenius constructed cosmologies
based on their work on auroral and other phenomena.

hydrodynamic simulations to study temporal and spatial behavior of star
formation occurring in nuclear rings of barred galaxies where radial gas
inflows are triggered solely by a bar potential. The star formation recipes
include a density threshold, an efficiency, conversion of gas to star
particles, and delayed momentum feedback via supernova explosions. We find that
star formation rate (SFR) in a nuclear ring is roughly equal to the mass inflow
rate to the ring, while it has a weak dependence on the total gas mass in the
ring. The SFR typically exhibits a strong primary burst followed by weak
secondary bursts before declining to very small values. The primary burst is
associated with the rapid gas infall to the ring due to the bar growth, while
the secondary bursts are caused by re-infall of the ejected gas from the
primary burst. While star formation in observed rings persists episodically
over a few Gyr, the duration of active star formation in our models lasts for
only about a half of the bar growth time, suggesting that the bar potential
alone is unlikely responsible for gas supply to the rings. When the SFR is low,
most star formation occurs at the contact points between the ring and the dust
lanes, leading to an azimuthal age gradient of young star clusters. When the
SFR is large, on the other hand, star formation is randomly distributed over
the whole circumference of the ring, resulting in no apparent azimuthal age
gradient. Since the ring shrinks in size with time, star clusters also exhibit
a radial age gradient, with younger clusters found closer to the ring. The
cluster mass function is well described by a power law, with a slope depending
on the SFR. Giant gas clouds in the rings have supersonic internal velocity
dispersions and are gravitationally bound.

less noise than the amplified noise of the input coherent state; for this
reason we refer to such devices as {\em immaculate}. Here we bound the working

current type algebras. Based on I.Krichever's theory of Lax operators on
algebraic curves they were introduced by I. Krichever and O. Sheinman. These
algebras are almost-graded Lie algebras of currents on Riemann surfaces with
marked points (in-points, out-points, and Tyurin points). In a previous joint
article of the author with Sheinman the local cocycles and associated
almost-graded central extensions are classified in the case of one in-point and
one out-point. It was shown that the almost-graded extension is essentially
unique. In this article the general case of Lax operator algebras corresponding
to several in- and out-points is considered. In a first step it is shown that
they are almost-graded. The grading is given by the splitting of the marked
points which are non-Tyurin points into in- and out-points. Next,
classification results both for local and bounded cocycles are shown. The
uniqueness theorem for almost-graded central extensions follows. For this
generalization additional techniques are needed which are presented in this
article.

requires accurate channel state information at receiver. One of the most
attracting adaptive channel estimation methods is least mean square (LMS)
algorithm. However, LMS-based method is often degraded by random scaling of
input training signal. To improve the estimation performance, in this paper we
apply the standard least mean square/fourth (LMS/F) algorithm to adaptive
channel estimation (ACE). Since the broadband channel is often described by
sparse channel model, such sparsity could be exploited as prior information.
First, we propose an adaptive sparse channel estimation (ASCE) method using
zero-attracting LMS/F (ZA-LMS/F) algorithm. To exploit the sparsity
effectively, an improved channel estimation method is also proposed, using
reweighted zero-attracting LMS/F (RZA-LMS/F) algorithm. We explain the reason
why sparse LMS/F algorithms using l_1-norm sparse constraint function can
improve the estimation performance by virtual of geometrical interpretation. In
addition, for different channel sparsity, we propose a Monte Carlo method to
select a regularization parameter for RA-LMS/F and RZA-LMS/F to achieve
approximate optimal estimation performance. Finally, simulation results show
that the proposed ASCE methods achieve better estimation performance than the
conventional one.

quantum conditional entropy $S(\rho^{AB}|\{\Pi^B_{k}\})$ over all measurements
on the subsystem $B$. In this paper, we provide a simple relation for the
conditional entropy as the difference of two Shannon entropies. The relation is
suitable for calculation of the quantum discord in the sense that it can by
used to obtain the quantum discord for some classes of two-qubit states,
without the need for minimization. We also present an analytical procedure of
optimization and obtain conditions under which the quantum conditional entropy
of a general two-qubit state is stationary. The presented relation is also used
to find a tight upper bound on the quantum discord.

"1304.3915","Tal Hassner","Tal Hassner and Ronen Basri","Single View Depth Estimation from Examples",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We describe a non-parametric, ""example-based"" method for estimating the depth
of an object, viewed in a single photo. Our method consults a database of
example 3D geometries, searching for those which look similar to the object in
the photo. The known depths of the selected database objects act as shape
priors which constrain the process of estimating the object's depth. We show
how this process can be performed by optimizing a well defined target
likelihood function, via a hard-EM procedure. We address the problem of
representing the (possibly infinite) variability of viewing conditions with a
finite (and often very small) example set, by proposing an on-the-fly example
update scheme. We further demonstrate the importance of non-stationarity in
avoiding misleading examples when estimating structured shapes. We evaluate our
method and present both qualitative as well as quantitative results for
challenging object classes. Finally, we show how this same technique may be
readily applied to a number of related problems. These include the novel task
of estimating the occluded depth of an object's backside and the task of
tailoring custom fitting image-maps for input depths.

  interface","5 figures",,"10.1063/1.4824653",,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Optical microscopy and multi-particle tracking are used to investigate the
cross-correlated diffusion of quasi two-dimensional (2D) colloidal particles
near an oil-water interface. It is shown that the effect of the interface on
correlated diffusion is asymmetric. Along the line joining the centers of
particles, the amplitude of correlated diffusion coefficient ${D}_{\|}(r)$ is
enhanced by the interface, while the decay rate of ${D}_{\|}(r)$ is hardly
affected. At the direction perpendicular to the line, the decay rate of
${D}_{\bot}(r)$ is enhanced at short inter-particle separation $r$. This
enhancing effect fades at the long $r$. In addition, both $D_{\|}(r)$ and
$D_{\bot}(r)$ are independent of the colloidal area fraction $n$ at long $r$,
which indicates that the hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) among the particles
are dominated by that through the surrounding fluid at this region. However, at
short $r$, $D_{\bot}(r)$ is dependent on $n$, which suggests the HIs are more
contributed from the 2D particle monolayer self.

perturbativity and vacuum stability of a two-singlet model of cold dark matter
(DM) that consists in extending the Standard Model with two real gauge-singlet
scalar fields. We then investigate the regions in the parameter space in which
the model is viable. For this, we require the model to reproduce the observed
DM relic density abundance, to comply with the measured XENON 100
direct-detection upper bounds, and to be consistent with the RGE perturbativity
and vacuum-stability criteria up to $40\mathrm{TeV}$. For small mixing angle
$\theta $ between the physical Higgs $h$ and auxiliary field, and DM-$h$ mutual
coupling constant $\lambda_{0}^{(4)}$, we find that the auxiliary-field mass is
confined to the interval $116\mathrm{GeV}-138\mathrm{GeV}$ while the DM mass is
mainly confined to the region above $57\mathrm{GeV}$. Increasing $\theta $
enriches the existing viability regions without relocating them, while
increasing $\lambda_{0}^{(4)}$ shrinks them with a tiny relocation. We show
that the model is consistent with the recent Higgs boson-like discovery by the
ATLAS and CMS experiments, while very light dark matter (masses below
$5\mathrm{GeV}$) is ruled out by the same experiments.

estimators are unbiased for finite sample sizes, even as small as N=3. It is
shown that the elementals form a complete basis for unbiased location- and
scale-invariant estimators constructed from linear combinations of
log-spacings. Preliminary numerical evidence is presented which suggests that
elemental combinations can be constructed which are consistent estimators of
the tail parameter for samples drawn from the pure GPD family.

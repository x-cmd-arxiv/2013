1.4-GHz are used to analyse its subpulse behaviour in detail. We confirm the
presence of three distinct drift modes (A,B,C) plus a disordered mode (N) and
show that they follow one another in specific cycles. Interpreting the pulsar's
profile as resulting from a sightline traverse which cuts across an outer cone
and tangentially grazes an inner cone, we demonstrate that the phase modulation
of the inner cone is locked to the amplitude modulation of the outer cone in
all the drift modes. The 9% nulls are found to be largely confined to the
dominant B and N modes, and, in the N mode, create alternating bunches of nulls
and emission in a quasi-periodic manner with an averaged fluctuation rate of
about 12 rotation periods ($P_1$). We explore the assumption that the apparent
drift is the first alias of a faster drift of subbeams equally spaced around
the cones. This is shown to imply that all modes A, B and C have a common
circulation time of 12 $P_1$ and differ only in the number of subbeams. This
timescale is on the same order as predicted by the classic {\bf E}$\times${\bf
B} drift and also coincides with the N-mode modulation. We therefore arrive at
a picture where the circulation speed remains roughly invariant while the
subbeams progressively diminish in number from modes A to B to C, and are then
re-established during the N mode. We suggest that aliasing combined with
subbeam loss may be responsible for apparently dramatic changes in drift rates
in other pulsars.

mechanical rotation and adaptive adjustment of the x-ray source flux. First, a
mathematical model for dynamic bowtie filtering is established for an
elliptical section in fan-beam geometry, and the contour of the optimal bowtie
is derived. Then, numerical simulation is performed to compare the performance
of the dynamic bowtie in the cases of an ideal phantom and a realistic
cross-section relative to the counterparts without any bowtie and with a fixed

photons in the case of an ideal phantom. In practical cases, our dynamic bowtie
can effectively reduce the dynamic range of detected signals inside the field
of view. Although our design is optimized for an elliptical phantom, the
resultant dynamic bowtie can be applied to a real fan-beam scan if the
underlying cross-section can be approximated as an ellipse. Furthermore, our
design methodology can be applied to specify an optimized dynamic bowtie for

  note: text overlap with arXiv:1202.4720",,,,"cs.SY cs.LG physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Smart energy grid is an emerging area for new applications of machine
learning in a non-stationary environment. Such a non-stationary environment
emerges when large-scale failures occur at power distribution networks due to
external disturbances such as hurricanes and severe storms. Power distribution
networks lie at the edge of the grid, and are especially vulnerable to external
disruptions. Quantifiable approaches are lacking and needed to learn
non-stationary behaviors of large-scale failure and recovery of power
distribution. This work studies such non-stationary behaviors in three aspects.
First, a novel formulation is derived for an entire life cycle of large-scale
failure and recovery of power distribution. Second, spatial-temporal models of
failure and recovery of power distribution are developed as geo-location based
multivariate non-stationary GI(t)/G(t)/Infinity queues. Third, the
non-stationary spatial-temporal models identify a small number of parameters to
be learned. Learning is applied to two real-life examples of large-scale
disruptions. One is from Hurricane Ike, where data from an operational network
is exact on failures and recoveries. The other is from Hurricane Sandy, where
aggregated data is used for inferring failure and recovery processes at one of
the impacted areas. Model parameters are learned using real data. Two findings
emerge as results of learning: (a) Failure rates behave similarly at the two
different provider networks for two different hurricanes but differently at the
geographical regions. (b) Both rapid- and slow-recovery are present for
Hurricane Ike but only slow recovery is shown for a regional distribution
network from Hurricane Sandy.

variety of factors including clutter noise produced by the coherent nature of
the illumination. Ultrasound images and infrared images have similar cluttered
appearance, that make 1 dimensional structures, as edges and object boundaries
difficult to locate. Structure information is usually extracted in two steps:
first, building and edge strength mask classifying pixels as edge points by
hypothesis testing, and secondly estimating from that mask, pixel wide
connected edges. With constant false alarm rate (CFAR) edge strength detectors
for speckle clutter, the image needs to be scanned by a sliding window composed
of several differently oriented splitting sub-windows. The accuracy of edge
location for these ratio detectors depends strongly on the orientation of the
sub-windows. In this work we propose to transform the edge strength detection
problem into a binary segmentation problem in the undecimated wavelet domain,
solvable using parallel 1d Hidden Markov Models. For general dependency models,
exact estimation of the state map becomes computationally complex, but in our
model, exact MAP is feasible. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated
on simulated noisy real-life natural images with available ground truth, while
the strength of our output edge map is measured with Pratt's, Baddeley an Kappa
proficiency measures. Finally, analysis and experiments on three different
types of SAR images, with different polarizations, resolutions and textures,
illustrate that the proposed method can detect structure on SAR images
effectively, providing a very good start point for active contour methods.

transparency. Moreover, its potential virtues grow in complex settings where
incentive compatible auctions may generate little or no revenue. Unfortunately,
the first-price auction is poorly understood in theory because equilibrium is
not {\em a priori} a credible predictor of bidder behavior.
  We take a dynamic approach to studying first-price auctions: rather than
basing performance guarantees solely on static equilibria, we study the
repeated setting and show that robust performance guarantees may be derived
from simple axioms of bidder behavior. For example, as long as a loser raises
her bid quickly, a standard first-price auction will generate at least as much
revenue as a second-price auction. We generalize this dynamic technique to
complex pay-your-bid auction settings and show that progressively stronger
assumptions about bidder behavior imply progressively stronger guarantees about
the auction's performance.
  Along the way, we find that the auctioneer's choice of bidding language is
critical when generalizing beyond the single-item setting, and we propose a
specific construction called the {\em utility-target auction} that performs
well. The utility-target auction includes a bidder's final utility as an
additional parameter, identifying the single dimension along which she wishes
to compete. This auction is closely related to profit-target bidding in
first-price and ascending proxy package auctions and gives strong revenue
guarantees for a variety of complex auction environments. Of particular
interest, the guaranteed existence of a pure-strategy equilibrium in the
utility-target auction shows how Overture might have eliminated the cyclic
behavior in their generalized first-price sponsored search auction if bidders
could have placed more sophisticated bids.

star forming spiral galaxy NGC 4666 to derive information about its kinematical
properties. Especially, we searched for infalling and outflowing ionized gas.
We determined surface brightness, radial velocity, and velocity dispersion of
the warm ionized gas via high spectral resolution (R ~ 9000) Fabry-P\'erot
interferometry. This allows the determination of the global velocity field and
the detection of local deviations from this verlocity field. We calculated
models of the DIG distribution and its kinematics for comparison with the
measured data. In this way we determined fundamental parameters such as the
inclination and the scale height of NGC 4666, and established the need for an
additional gas component to fit our observed data. We found individual areas,
especially along the minor axis, with gas components reaching into the halo
which we interpret as an outflowing component of the diffuse ionized gas. As
the main result of our study, we were able to determine that the vertical
structure of the DIG distribution in NGC 4666 is best modeled with two
components of ionized gas, a thick and a thin disk with 0.8 kpc and 0.2 kpc

is known. We address this issue by analyzing a local quantum quench in the
long-range Ising model in a transverse field, where interactions decay as a
variable power-law with distance $\propto r^{-\alpha}$, $\alpha>0$. Using
complementary numerical and analytical techniques, we identify three dynamical
regimes: short-range-like with an emerging light cone for $\alpha>2$; weakly
long-range for $1<\alpha<2$ without a clear light cone but with a finite
propagation speed of almost all excitations; and fully non-local for $\alpha<1$
with instantaneous transmission of correlations. This last regime breaks
generalized Lieb--Robinson bounds and thus locality. Numerical calculation of
the entanglement spectrum demonstrates that the usual picture of propagating
quasi-particles remains valid, allowing an intuitive interpretation of our
findings via divergences of quasi-particle velocities. Our results may be
tested in state-of-the-art trapped-ion experiments.

occur as a result of successive magnetic instabilities with respect to
different order parameters, which usually transform according to different

lines of a sample of 53 intensely star forming galaxies at z=1.3 to 2.7
observed with SINFONI on the ESO-VLT. We find large velocity dispersions in the
lines, sigma=30-250 km/s. Our data agree well with simulations where we applied
beam-smearing and assumed a scaling relation of the form: velocity dispersion
is proportional to the square root of the star-formation intensity
(star-formation rate per unit area). We conclude that the dispersions are
primarily driven by star formation. To explain the high surface brightness and
optical line ratios, high thermal pressures in the warm ionized medium, WIM,
are required (log P/k (K/cm^3)>~6-7). Such thermal pressures in the WIM are
similar to those observed in nearby starburst galaxies, but occur over much
larger physical scales. Moreover, the relatively low ionization parameters
necessary to fit the high surface brightnesses and optical line ratios suggest
that the gas is not only directly associated with regions of star formation,
but is wide spread throughout the general ISM. Thus the optical emission line
gas is a tracer of the large scale dynamics of the bulk of the ISM. We present
a simple model for the energy input from young stars in an accreting galaxy, to
argue that the intense star-formation is supporting high turbulent pressure,
which roughly balances the gravitational pressure and thus enables distant gas
accreting disks to maintain a Toomre disk instability parameter Q~1. For a star
formation efficiency of 3%, only 5-15% of the mechanical energy from young
stars that is deposited in the ISM is needed to support the level of turbulence
required for maintaining this balance. Since this balance is maintained by
energy injected into the ISM by the young stars themselves, this suggests that
star formation in high redshift galaxies is self-regulating.

that scalar (SISO) finite field channels over $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ are analogous
to n x n vector (MIMO) channels in the wireless setting, but with an important
distinction -- there is additional structure due to finite field arithmetic
which enforces commutativity of matrix multiplication and limits the channel
diversity to n, making these channels similar to diagonal channels in the
wireless setting. Within the limits imposed by the channel structure, the DoF
optimal precoding solutions for wireless networks can be translated into
capacity optimal solutions for their finite field counterparts. This is shown
through the study of the 2-user X channel and the 3-user interference channel.
Besides bringing the insights from wireless networks into network coding
applications, the study of finite field networks over $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ also
touches upon important open problems in wireless networks (finite SNR, finite
diversity scenarios) through interesting parallels between p and SNR, and n and
diversity.

in detail up to dimension eight (e.g. R^4). In D=4, owing to the anomaly in the
rigid SL(2,R) duality symmetry, the restrictions on divergences need careful
treatment. In pure N=4 supergravity, this anomalous symmetry still implies
duality invariance of candidate counterterms at three loops. Provided one makes
the additional assumption that there exists a full 16-supercharge off-shell
formulation of the theory, counterterms at L>1 loops would also have to be
writable as full-superspace integrals. At the three-loop order such a
duality-invariant full-superspace integral candidate counterterm exists, but
its duality invariance is marginal in the sense that the full-superspace
counter-Lagrangian is not itself duality-invariant. We show that such marginal
invariants are not allowable as counterterms in a 16-supercharge off-shell
formalism. It is not possible to draw the same conclusion when vector
multiplets are present because of the appearance of F^4 terms in the SL(2,R)
anomaly. In D=5 there is no one-loop anomaly in the shift invariance of the
dilaton, and we argue that this implies finiteness at two loops, again subject

known result of Maassen and Uffink (MU) with a probability larger than 98%. We
also show that the bounds investigated are invariant under the dephasing and
permutation operations. Finally, we derive a classical analogue of the MU
uncertainty relation, which is formulated for stochastic transition matrices.

a revised orbit, different from the then available astrometric Hipparcos orbit.
  Additional spectroscopic data, obtained with the BESO spectrograph at Cerro
Armazones, confirm the newly found orbit, even though the resulting radial
velocities do not allow to improve on the recent orbit. We combine the latter
with the Hipparcos measurements to secure the astrometric orbit, and derive the
inclination of the system. Using evolutionary tracks, we can finally constrain
all the parameters of the two components in this system.
  We confirm the mass of the primary, 3 M$_\odot$, and find that the companion
has a mass of 0.9 M$_\odot$. The inclination of the system is $i=93^{\circ} \pm
4.7^{\circ}$, and is potentially eclipsing; we predict the time of the next
conjunction. Given that the eccentricity of the orbit and the exact value of
the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity relies on just one set of points, we
also urge observers to measure radial velocities at the next periastron passage

expected for it in the Standard Model (SM), with a possible enhancement in the
two-photon channel. Such SM-like Higgs scenario can be realized within the
Inert Doublet Model (IDM) - a version of the Two Higgs Doublet Model with an
exact discrete D (Z_2-type) symmetry. In this model one SU(2) doublet plays the
role of the SM Higgs doublet with one SM-like Higgs boson. The second doublet
has no vacuum expectation value and does not interact with fermions. Among four
scalars constituting this D-odd doublet the lightest one is stable, being if
neutral a good DM candidate with the right relic density. In this paper an
analysis of the two-photon Higgs decay rate in IDM, respecting theoretical and
other experimental constraints, is presented. The enhancement in the two-photon
channel is possible only if invisible channels are closed, with the enhancement
R_{\gamma \gamma}>1.2 for masses of DM and charged scalars below 154 GeV. The
temperature evolution of the Universe to the Inert phase (described by the IDM)
in T^2 approximation is presented and all possible sequences of phase
transitions in one, two and three steps are analyzed. Going beyond this
approximation by using an effective potential approach with one-loop T=0
Weinberg-Coleman term and temperature dependent effective potential at T\not =0
we address the question, whether the strong first-order phase transition needed
for baryogenesis can be realized in IDM. A region with a good DM relic density
and a strong first-order phase transition is established, and discussed in the
light of the XENON-100 data.

invariance for 3-point functions of the stress-energy tensor, conserved
currents and scalar operators in general dimension and in momentum space. Our
starting point is a novel and very effective decomposition of tensor
correlators which reduces their computation to that of a number of scalar form
factors. For example, the most general 3-point function of a conserved and
traceless stress-energy tensor is determined by only five form factors.
Dilatations and special conformal Ward identities then impose additional
conditions on these form factors. The special conformal Ward identities become
a set of first and second order differential equations, whose general solution
is given in terms of integrals involving a product of three Bessel functions
(`triple-K integrals'). All in all, the correlators are completely determined
up to a number of constants, in agreement with well-known position space
results. We develop systematic methods for explicitly evaluating the triple-K
integrals. In odd dimensions they are given in terms of elementary functions
while in even dimensions the results involve dilogarithms. In some cases, the
triple-K integrals diverge and subtractions are necessary and we show how such
subtractions are related to conformal anomalies.
  This paper contains two parts that can be read independently of each other.
In the first part, we explain the method that leads to the solution for the
correlators in terms of triple-K integrals and how to evaluate these integrals,
while the second part contains a self-contained presentation of all results.

black holes (BHs) found by dynamical modeling of spatially resolved kinematics.
Most influential was the discovery of a tight correlation between BH mass and
the velocity dispersion of the host-galaxy bulge. It and other correlations led
to the belief that BHs and bulges coevolve by regulating each other's growth.
New results are now replacing this simple story with a richer and more
plausible picture in which BHs correlate differently with different galaxy
components. BHs are found in pure-disk galaxies, so classical
(elliptical-galaxy-like) bulges are not necessary to grow BHs. But BHs do not
correlate with galaxy disks. And any correlations with disk-grown pseudobulges
or halo dark matter are so weak as to imply no close coevolution. We suggest
that there are four regimes of BH feedback. 1- Local, stochastic feeding of
small BHs in mainly bulgeless galaxies involves too little energy to result in
coevolution. 2- Global feeding in major, wet galaxy mergers grows giant BHs in
short, quasar-like ""AGN"" events whose feedback does affect galaxies. This makes
classical bulges and coreless-rotating ellipticals. 3- At the highest BH
masses, maintenance-mode feedback into X-ray gas has the negative effect of
helping to keep baryons locked up in hot gas. This happens in giant,
core-nonrotating ellipticals. They inherit coevolution magic from smaller
progenitors. 4- Independent of any feedback physics, the averaging that results
from successive mergers helps to engineer tight BH correlations.

-6.2, -5.5), metal-poor (<[Fe/H]>= -2.4, -2.5) systems that have old stellar
populations (> 11 Gyr). Because they have long relaxation times, we can
directly measure the low-mass stellar IMF by counting stars below the
main-sequence turnoff without correcting for dynamical evolution. Over the
stellar mass range probed by our data, 0.52 - 0.77 Msun, the IMF is best fit by
a power-law slope of alpha = 1.2^{+0.4}_{-0.5} for Hercules and alpha = 1.3 +/-
0.8 for Leo IV. For Hercules, the IMF slope is more shallow than a Salpeter IMF
(alpha=2.35) at the 5.8-sigma level, and a Kroupa IMF (alpha=2.3 above 0.5
Msun) at 5.4-sigma level. We simultaneously fit for the binary fraction,
finding f_binary = 0.47^{+0.16}_{-0.14} for Hercules, and 0.47^{+0.37}_{-0.17}
for Leo IV. The UFD binary fractions are consistent with that inferred for
Milky Way stars in the same mass range, despite very different metallicities.
In contrast, the IMF slopes in the UFDs are shallower than other galactic
environments. In the mass range 0.5 - 0.8 Msun, we see a trend across the
handful of galaxies with directly measured IMFs such that the power-law slopes
become shallower (more bottom-light) with decreasing galactic velocity
dispersion and metallicity. This trend is qualitatively consistent with results
in elliptical galaxies inferred via indirect methods and is direct evidence for
IMF variations with galactic environment.

dense and warm photon dominated regions (PDRs). The Galactic Observations of
Terahertz C+ (GOTC+) project surveys the [CII] line over the entire Galactic

present the first longitude-velocity maps of the [CII] emission for Galactic
latitudes b=0deg, +-0.5deg, and +-1.0deg. [CII] emission is mostly associated
with spiral arms, mainly emerging from Galactocentric distances between 4 and
10 kpc. We estimate that most of the observed [CII] emission is produced by
dense PDRs (47%), with smaller contributions from CO-dark H2 gas (28%), cold
atomic gas (21%), and ionized gas (4%). Atomic gas inside the Solar radius is
mostly in the form of cold neutral medium (CNM), while the warm neutral medium
(WNM) gas dominates the outer galaxy. The average fraction of CNM relative to
total atomic gas is 43%. We find that the warm and diffuse CO-dark H2 is
distributed over a larger range of Galactocentric distances (4-11 kpc) than the
cold and dense H2 gas traced by 12CO and 13CO (4-8kpc). The fraction of CO-dark
H2 to total H2 increases with Galactocentric distance, ranging from 20% at 4
kpc to 80% at 10 kpc. On average, CO-dark H2 accounts for 30% of the molecular
mass of the Milky Way. When the CO-dark H2 component is included, the radial
distribution of the CO-to-H2 conversion factor is steeper than that when only
molecular gas traced by CO is considered. Most of the observed [CII] emission
emerging from dense PDRs is associated with modest far-ultraviolet fields in
the range chi0~1-30.

co-dimension in a background space-time, providing the effective theory
describing long-wavelength perturbations of black branes. When the co-dimension
is non-zero, the system acquires fluid-elastic properties and constitutes what
is called a fluid brane. Applying an effective action approach, the most
general form of the free energy quadratic in the extrinsic curvature and
extrinsic twist potential of stationary fluid brane configurations is
constructed to second order in a derivative expansion. This construction
generalizes the Helfrich-Canham bending energy for fluid membranes studied in
theoretical biology to the case in which the fluid is rotating. It is found
that stationary fluid brane configurations are characterized by a set of 3
elastic response coefficients, 3 hydrodynamic response coefficients and 1 spin
response coefficient for co-dimension greater than one. Moreover, the elastic
degrees of freedom present in the system are coupled to the hydrodynamic
degrees of freedom. For co-dimension-1 surfaces we find a 8 independent
parameter family of stationary fluid branes. It is further shown that elastic
and spin corrections to (non)-extremal brane effective actions can be accounted
for by a multipole expansion of the stress-energy tensor, therefore
establishing a relation between the different formalisms of Carter,
Capovilla-Guven and Vasilic-Vojinovic and between gravity and the effective
description of stationary fluid branes. Finally, it is shown that the Young
modulus found in the literature for black branes falls into the class predicted
by this approach - a relation which is then used to make a proposal for the
second order effective action of stationary blackfolds and to find the
corrected horizon angular velocity of thin black rings.

cloud using multi-wavelength data including Spitzer, WISE, 2MASS, and XMM
covering ~1390 YSOs across a range of evolutionary stages. In addition, we
targeted a sub-sample of YSOs for optical spectroscopy. We use this data, along
with archival photometric data, to derive spectral types, extinction values,
masses, ages, as well as accretion rates. We obtain a disk fraction of ~50% in
L1641. The disk frequency is almost constant as a function of stellar mass with
a slight peak at log(M_*/M_sun)\approx-0.25. The analysis of multi-epoch
spectroscopic data indicates that the accretion variability of YSOs cannot
explain the two orders of magnitude of scatter for YSOs with similar masses.
Forty-six new transition disk (TD) objects are confirmed in this work, and we
find that the fraction of accreting TDs is lower than for optically thick disks
(40--45% vs. 77--79% respectively). We confirm our previous result that the
accreting TDs have a similar median accretion rate to normal optically thick
disks. We confirm that two star formation modes (isolated vs. clustered) exist
in L1641. We find that the diskless YSOs are statistically older than the YSOs
with optically-thick disks and the transition disk objects have a median age
which is intermediate between the two populations. We tentatively study the
star formation history in L1641 based on the age distribution and find that
star formation started to be active 2--3 Myr ago.

about the stellar mass-to-light ratio, the massive end of the stellar mass
function is rather sensitive to how one fits the light profiles of the most
luminous galaxies. We quantify this by comparing the luminosity and stellar
mass functions based on SDSS cmodel magnitudes, and PyMorph single-Sersic and
Sersic-Exponential fits to the surface brightness profiles of galaxies in the
SDSS. The PyMorph fits return more light, so that the predicted masses are
larger than when cmodel magnitudes are used. As a result, the total stellar
mass density at z~0.1 is about 1.2x larger than in our previous analysis of the
SDSS. The differences are most pronounced at the massive end, where the
measured number density of objects having M* > 6 x 10^{11} Msun is ~5x larger.
Alternatively, at number densities of 10^{-6} Mpc^{-3}, the limiting stellar
mass is 2x larger. The differences with respect to fits by other authors,
typically based on Petrosian-like magnitudes, are even more dramatic, although
some of these differences are due to sky-subtraction problems, and are
sometimes masked by large differences in the assumed $M_*/L$ (even after
scaling to the same IMF). Our results impact studies of the growth and assembly
of stellar mass in galaxies, and of the relation between stellar and halo mass,
so we provide simple analytic fits to these new luminosity and stellar mass

analysis of the long term 0.5--4.5 keV variability of XBs via structure

are often similar; this has enabled us to search for BHCs outside of GCs. We

those seen in GCs. We have found a parameter space where our black hole
candidates are separated from Galactic neutron star binaries: we show that

milliseconds, and is typically modeled using the cable equation. This is a good
approximation for processes when ionic concentrations vary little during the
time course of a simulation. During periods of intense neural signalling,
however, the local extracellular K+ concentration may increase by several
millimolars. Clearance of excess K+ likely depends partly on diffusion in the
extracellular space, partly on local uptake by- and intracellular transport
within astrocytes. This process takes place at the time scale of seconds, and
can not be modeled accurately without accounting for the spatiotemporal
variations in ion concentrations. The work presented here consists of two main
parts: First, we developed a general electrodiffusive formalism for modeling
ion concentration dynamics in a one-dimensional geometry, including both an
intra- and extracellular domain. The formalism was based on the Nernst-Planck
equations. It ensures (i) consistency between the membrane potential and ion
concentrations, (ii) global particle/charge conservation, and (iii) accounts
for diffusion and concentration dependent variations in resistivities. Second,
we applied the formalism to model how astrocytes exchange ions with the ECS,
and identified the key astrocytic mechanisms involved in K+ removal from high
concentration regions. We found that a local increase in extracellular
K\textsuperscript{+} evoked a local depolarization of the astrocyte membrane,
which at the same time (i) increased the local astrocytic uptake of
K\textsuperscript{+}, (ii) suppressed extracellular transport of K+, (iii)
increased transport of K+ within astrocytes, and (iv) facilitated astrocytic
relase of K+ in extracellular low concentration regions. In summary, these
mechanisms seem optimal for shielding the extracellular space from excess K+.

with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE), the 175.4s and 85.4s pulsations
were considered to originate from new Be/X-ray binary (BeXRB) pulsars with
unknown locations. Using rapid follow-up INTEGRAL and XMM-Newton observations,
we show the first pulsar (designated SXP175) to be coincident with a candidate
high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) in the northern bar region of the SMC undergoing
a small Type II outburst. The orbital period (87d) and spectral class
(B0-B0.5IIIe) of this system are determined and presented here for the first
time. The second pulsar is shown not to be new at all, but is consistent with
being SXP91.1 - a pulsar discovered at the very beginning of the 13 year long
RXTE key monitoring programme of the SMC. Whilst it is theoretically possible
for accreting neutron stars to change spin period so dramatically over such a
short time, the X-ray and optical data available for this source suggest this
spin-up is continuous during long phases of X-ray quiescence, where accretion
driven spin-up of the neutron star should be minimal.

metric, which has only two independent parameters: the mass and the spin. The
unique dependence on these two parameters is known as the no-hair theorem. This
theorem may be tested observationally by using electromagnetic or
gravitational-wave observations to map the spacetime around a candidate black
hole and measure potential deviations from the Kerr metric. Several parametric
frameworks have been constructed for tests of the no-hair theorem. Due to the
uniqueness of the Kerr metric, any such parametric framework must violate at
least one of the assumptions of the no-hair theorem. This can lead to
pathologies in the spacetime, such as closed timelike curves or singularities,
which may hamper using the metric in the strong-field regime. In this paper, I
analyze in detail several parametric frameworks and show explicitly the manner
in which they differ from the Kerr metric. I calculate the coordinate locations
of event horizons in these metrics, if any exist, using methods adapted from
the numerical relativity literature. I identify the regions where each
parametric deviation is unphysical as well as the range of coordinates and
parameters for which each spacetime remains a regular extension of the Kerr
metric and is, therefore, suitable for observational tests of the no-hair
theorem.

determine a partition into packs, and an assignment of processors to
applications, that minimize the sum of the execution times of the packs. We
thoroughly study the complexity of this optimization problem, and propose
several heuristics that exhibit very good performance on a variety of
workloads, whose application execution times model profiles of parallel

is a well researched area. However, optimization of OPTIONAL pattern queries
(a.k.a. SQL left-outer-joins) poses additional challenges, due to the
restrictions on the \textit{reordering} of left-outer-joins. The occurrence of
such queries tends to be as high as 50% of the total queries (e.g., DBPedia
query logs).
  In this paper, we present \textit{Left Bit Right} (LBR), a technique for
\textit{well-designed} nested BGP and OPTIONAL pattern queries. Through LBR, we
propose a novel method to represent such queries using a graph of
\textit{supernodes}, which is used to aggressively prune the RDF triples, with
the help of compressed indexes. We also propose novel optimization strategies
-- first of a kind, to the best of our knowledge -- that combine together the
characteristics of \textit{acyclicity} of queries, \textit{minimality}, and
\textit{nullification}, \textit{best-match} operators. In this paper, we focus
on OPTIONAL patterns without UNIONs or FILTERs, but we also show how UNIONs and
FILTERs can be handled with our technique using a \textit{query rewrite}. Our
evaluation on RDF graphs of up to and over one billion triples, on a commodity
laptop with 8 GB memory, shows that LBR can process \textit{well-designed}
low-selectivity complex queries up to 11 times faster compared to the
state-of-the-art RDF column-stores as Virtuoso and MonetDB, and for highly
selective queries, LBR is at par with them.

the methods used in practice are often limiting, motivated by reasons of
computational efficiency rather than geophysical accuracy. A typical
geophysical application involves inverse problems for which many different
fault configurations need to be examined, each adding to the computational
load. In practice, this precludes conventional finite-element methods, which
suffer a large computational overhead on account of geometric changes. This
paper presents a new non-conforming finite-element method based on weak
imposition of the displacement discontinuity. The weak imposition of the
discontinuity enables the application of approximation spaces that are
independent of the dislocation geometry, thus enabling optimal reuse of
computational components. Such reuse of computational components renders
finite-element modeling a viable option for inverse problems in geophysical
applications. A detailed analysis of the approximation properties of the new

included. Currently, uncertainties are absent from all other rate libraries,
and, although estimates have been attempted in previous evaluations and
compilations, these are generally not based on rigorous statistical
definitions. A common standard for deriving uncertainties is clearly warranted.
STARLIB represents a first step in addressing this deficiency by providing a
tabular, up-to-date database that supplies not only the rate and its
uncertainty but also its distribution. Because a majority of rates are
lognormally distributed, this allows the construction of rate probability
densities from the columns of STARLIB. This structure is based on a recently
suggested Monte Carlo method to calculate reaction rates, where uncertainties
are rigorously defined. In STARLIB, experimental rates are supplemented with:
(i) theoretical TALYS rates for reactions for which no experimental input is
available, and (ii) laboratory and theoretical weak rates. STARLIB includes all
types of reactions of astrophysical interest to Z = 83, such as (p,g), (p,a),
(a,n), and corresponding reverse rates. Strong rates account for thermal target
excitations. Here, we summarize our Monte Carlo formalism, introduce the
library, compare methods of correcting rates for stellar environments, and
discuss how to implement our library in Monte Carlo nucleosynthesis studies. We

deeper drawback than anticipated so far. The impact on the running of the SM

and we discuss the role of quadratic divergences within the Standard Model. The
change of sign of the coefficient of the quadratically divergent terms showing
up at about mu_0 ~ 1.4 x 10^16 GeV may be understood as a first order phase
transition restoring the symmetric phase, while its large negative values at
lower scales triggers the Higgs mechanism, running parameters evolve in such a
way that the symmetry is restored two orders of magnitude before the Planck
scale. Thus, the electroweak phase transition takes place at the scale mu_0 and
not at the electroweak scale v ~ 250 GeV. The SM Higgs system and its phase
transition could play a key role for the inflation of the early universe. Also
baryogenesis has to be reconsidered under the aspect that perturbative

quark and a light quark are investigated using QCD Laplace sum rules. Masses
are determined using appropriately constructed gauge invariant correlation
functions, including for the first time next-to-leading order perturbative
contributions. The $J^P=0^+$ and $1^+$ charm-light diquark masses are
respectively found to be 1.86$\pm$0.05 GeV and 1.87$\pm$0.10 GeV, while those
of the $0^+$ and $1^+$ bottom-light diquarks are both determined to be
5.08$\pm$0.04 GeV. The sum rules derived for heavy-light diquarks with negative
parity are poorly behaved and do not permit unambiguous mass predictions, in
agreement with previous results for negative parity light diquarks. The scalar
and axial vector heavy-light diquark masses are degenerate within uncertainty,
as expected by heavy quark symmetry considerations. Furthermore, these mass
predictions are in good agreement with masses extracted in constituent diquark
models of the tetraquark candidates X(3872) and $Y_b(10890)$. Thus these
results provide QCD support for the interpretation of the X(3872) and
$Y_b(10890)$ as $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ tetraquark states composed of diquark clusters.
Further implications for tetraquarks among the heavy quarkonium-like XYZ states
are discussed.

graphs with possibly tied outcomes are graphs in which there are three possible
states for each unordered pair of graph nodes: node i wins and node j loses;
node j wins and node i loses; neither node wins (i.e., tied outcome). The model
also estimates the rates at which individual informants (or instruments)
mistake the winning and losing dyad members, falsely report a tied outcome, and
falsely report a decisive outcome. The model was developed to infer social
dominance structure from multiple informants' reports, but is potentially
useful for inferring any structure that can be characterized by a tournament
graph, and which is measured from multiple reports.

controls the singularity at the origin. Besides, since the transverse manifold
has a cylindrical symmetry according to the 3-brane, this geometry can be

of a new warp function and the angular metric component of the resolved

a regular behavior in that region. The analysis of the gauge field in this

methodology extends the classical two-stage least squares estimator to high

performance of the proposed method is evaluated by simulation studies and its
usefulness is illustrated by an analysis of mouse obesity data. Supplementary

from a generic class of two dimensional dilatonic gravitational systems coupled
to matter. This gives us a second class system, a total Hamiltonian consisting
of a Hamiltonian constraint, a diffeomorphism constraint and two second class
constraints. We calculate the Dirac brackets, bring them to a standard form
similar to the Poisson brackets by introducing a new variable. Then by
rescaling lapse and shift, the Hamiltonian constraint is transformed into a
form where it has an strong Abelian algebra with itself. This property holds
both in vacuum case and in case with matter coupling. Then for each of the
vacuum and the coupled-to-matter cases, we preform two gauge fixings, one set
for each case, and solve the classical system completely in both cases. The
gauge fixing of the case coupled to matter is done by implementing a method
based on canonical transformation to a new set of variables and leads to a true
local Hamiltonian. We also show that our formalism is consistent with the
original CGHS paper by showing that the equations of motion are the same in
both cases. Finally we derive the relevant surface term of the model.

sizes, systems with many components or degrees of freedom, organized in ways
where they can be identified as macroscopic objects. This emerging field is
ushered in by several categories of definitive experiments in
superconductivity, electromechanical systems, Bose-Einstein condensates and
others. Yet this new field which is rich in open issues at the foundation of
quantum and statistical physics remains little explored theoretically [1]. This
talk summarizes our thoughts on attempting a systematic investigation into its
foundation, with the goal of ultimately revealing or building a viable
theoretical framework. Three major themes discussed in three intended essays
are the large N expansion [2], the correlation hierarchy [3] and quantum
entanglement [4]. We give a sketch of the first two themes and then discuss
several key issues in the consideration of macro and quantum, namely, a)
recognition that in a composite body there exist many 'levels of structure'
characterized by collective variables. The quantum features of a macroscopic
object can be captured by understanding how these collective variables
function; b) 'quantum entanglement', an exclusively quantum feature [5], is
known to persist to high temperatures [6] and large scales [7] under certain
conditions, and may actually decrease with increased connectivity in a quantum
network [8]. Here we use entanglement as a measure of quantumness and pick out
these somewhat counter-intuitive examples to show that there are blind spots
worthy of our attention and issues which we need to analyze closer. Our purpose
is to try to remove the stigma that quantum only pertains to micro, in order to
make way for deeper probes into the conditions whereby quantum features of
macroscopic systems manifest.

quantification for parameter estimates and model choices. To be more specific,
this paper proposes methods for deriving a probability density function on the

the corresponding parameters. These proposed methods are developed using the
generalized fiducial methodology, which is a variant of Fisher's controversial
fiducial idea. Theoretical properties of the proposed methods are studied, and
in particular it is shown that statistical inference based on the proposed
methods will have exact asymptotic frequentist property. In terms of empirical
performances, the proposed methods are tested by simulation experiments and an
application to a real data set. Lastly this work can also be seen as an
interesting and successful application of Fisher's fiducial idea to an
important and contemporary problem. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this
is the first time that the fiducial idea is being applied to a so-called ""large

statistics such as weak lensing shear correlations, the distribution of
galaxies, and cluster abundance. To fully exploit these observations, theorists
must provide predictions that are at least as accurate as the measurements, as
well as robust estimates of systematic errors that are inherent to the modeling
process. In the nonlinear regime of structure formation, this challenge can
only be overcome by developing a large-scale, multi-physics simulation
capability covering a range of cosmological models and astrophysical processes.
As a first step to achieving this goal, we have recently developed a prediction
scheme for the matter power spectrum (a so-called emulator), accurate at the 1%
level out to k~1/Mpc and z=1 for wCDM cosmologies based on a set of
high-accuracy N-body simulations. It is highly desirable to increase the range
in both redshift and wavenumber and to extend the reach in cosmological
parameter space. To make progress in this direction, while minimizing
computational cost, we present a strategy that maximally re-uses the original
simulations. We demonstrate improvement over the original spatial dynamic range
by an order of magnitude, reaching k~10 h/Mpc, a four-fold increase in redshift
coverage, to z=4, and now include the Hubble parameter as a new independent
variable. To further the range in k and z, a new set of nested simulations run
at modest cost is added to the original set. The extension in h is performed by
including perturbation theory results within a multi-scale procedure for
building the emulator. This economical methodology still gives excellent error
control, ~5% near the edges of the domain of applicability of the emulator. A
public domain code for the new emulator is released as part of the work
presented in this paper.

optimized C or C++ routines with no guarantee of correctness. Meanwhile, many
interactive theorem provers can now employ SAT or SMT solvers to automatically
solve finite goals, but no theorem prover makes use of these advanced,

  We have developed two ways to represent AIGs within the ACL2 theorem prover.
One representation, Hons-AIGs, is especially convenient to use and reason

packages and allows for efficient algorithms. We have implemented functions for
converting between these representations, random vector simulation, conversion

development environments have matured, developers are increasingly turning to
the GPU to off-load the main host CPU of numerically-intensive, parallelizable
computations. Modern GPUs feature hundreds of cores, and offer programming
niceties such as double-precision floating point, and even limited recursion.
This shift from CPU to GPU, however, raises the question: how do we know that
these new GPU-based algorithms are correct?
  In order to explore this new verification frontier, we formalized a
parallelizable all-pairs shortest path (APSP) algorithm for weighted graphs,
originally coded in NVIDIA's CUDA language, in ACL2. The ACL2 specification is
written using a single-threaded object (stobj) and tail recursion, as the
stobj/tail recursion combination yields the most straightforward translation
from imperative programming languages, as well as efficient, scalable
executable specifications within ACL2 itself. The ACL2 version of the APSP
algorithm can process millions of vertices and edges with little to no garbage
generation, and executes at one-sixth the speed of a host-based version of APSP
coded in C- a very respectable result for a theorem prover.
  In addition to formalizing the APSP algorithm (which uses Dijkstra's shortest
path algorithm at its core), we have also provided capability that the original
APSP code lacked, namely shortest path recovery. Path recovery is accomplished
using a secondary ACL2 stobj implementing a LIFO stack, which is proven
correct. To conclude the experiment, we ported the ACL2 version of the APSP
kernels back to C, resulting in a less than 5% slowdown, and also performed a
partial back-port to CUDA, which, surprisingly, yielded a slight performance
increase.

limits) for a total of 34 elements in each star, based on high-resolution (R ~
30,000) spectroscopy obtained with Magellan-Clay/MIKE. Our results are compared

neutron-capture material in HE2138-3336 originated from mass transfer from a
binary companion star that previously went through the AGB phase, whereas for
HE2258-6358, an additional process has to be taken into account to explain its

modest confidence level. Moreover, it appears that there is some
proportionality between the magnitude of a cosmic-ray intensity change and a
corresponding DTR deviation, both in the case of FD and GLE events. Eventual
increase of the confidence levels at which these correlations are established
would have to wait for the significant increase of the number of well defined
and sufficiently intense recorded departures of cosmic-ray intensity from its
stationary mean value. On the other hand, the probability of such an accidental
multiple coincidence of independent pieces of evidence is certainly very low.

interaction between hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic parts. The latter is
treated within a simple relaxation approximation. We show that, by considering
the non-hydrodynamic part via a weighted density approximation, we obtain a

(WPCN) in which one hybrid access point (H-AP) with constant power supply
coordinates the wireless energy/information transmissions to/from distributed
users that do not have energy sources. A ""harvest-then-transmit"" protocol is
proposed where all users first harvest the wireless energy broadcast by the
H-AP in the downlink (DL) and then send their independent information to the
H-AP in the uplink (UL) by time-division-multiple-access (TDMA). First, we
study the sum-throughput maximization of all users by jointly optimizing the
time allocation for the DL wireless power transfer versus the users' UL
information transmissions given a total time constraint based on the users' DL
and UL channels as well as their average harvested energy values. By applying
convex optimization techniques, we obtain the closed-form expressions for the
optimal time allocations to maximize the sum-throughput. Our solution reveals
""doubly near-far"" phenomenon due to both the DL and UL distance-dependent
signal attenuation, where a far user from the H-AP, which receives less
wireless energy than a nearer user in the DL, has to transmit with more power
in the UL for reliable information transmission. Consequently, the maximum
sum-throughput is achieved by allocating substantially more time to the near
users than the far users, thus resulting in unfair rate allocation among
different users. To overcome this problem, we furthermore propose a new
performance metric so-called common-throughput with the additional constraint
that all users should be allocated with an equal rate regardless of their
distances to the H-AP. We present an efficient algorithm to solve the
common-throughput maximization problem. Simulation results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the common-throughput approach for solving the new doubly

controlled from +1 to -1. We synthesized the 1111-type CaFeAsH and LnFeAsO1-xHx
(Ln = lanthanide) with the ZrCuSiAs type structure by a high-pressure synthesis
method. The position and valence state of the substituted H were determined by
neutron diffraction and density functional theory calculations. The close
similarity in the structural and electrical properties of CaFeAsH and CaFeAsF
indicated the formation of the hydride ion (H-), which is isovalent with the
fluoride ion (F-), in the 1111-type iron arsenides. When some of the O2- ions
in LnFeAsO are replaced by H-, superconductivity is induced by electron doping
to the FeAs-layer to maintain charge neutrality. Since the substitution limit
of hydrogen in LnFeAsO (x~0.5) is much higher than that of fluorine (x~0.2),
the hydrogen substitution technique provides an effective pathway for
high-density electron-doping, making it possible to draw the complete
electronic phase diagram of LnFeAsO. The x-T diagrams of LnFeAsO1-xHx (Ln = La,
Ce, Sm, Gd) have a wide superconducting (SC) region spanning the range x = 0.04
to 0.4, which is far from the parent antiferromagnetic region near x = 0.0. For
Ln=La, another SC dome region was found in the range x = ~ 0.2 to ~0.5 with a
maximum Tc = 36 K, in addition to a conventional SC dome located at x ~0.08
with maximum Tc = 29 K. Density functional theory calculations performed for
LaFeAsO1-xHx indicated that the newly observed Tc is correlated with the
appearance of degeneration of the Fe 3d bands (dxy, dyz and dzx), which is
caused not only by regularization of the tetrahedral shape of FeAs4 due to

this end, the propagation of Rayleigh waves on the surface of the material when
it is maintained in a static state of triaxial prestrain is considered. The
prestrain is such that the free surface of the half-space is a principal plane
of deformation. The exact secular equation is established for surface waves
traveling in a principal direction of strain with attenuation along the
principal direction normal to the free plane. As the half-space is put under
increasing compressive loads, the speed of the wave eventually tends to zero
and the bifurcation criterion, or stability equation, is reached.
  Then the analysis is specialized to specific forms of strain energy functions
and prestrain, and comparisons are made with results previously obtained in the
case of incompressible neo-Hookean or Mooney-Rivlin materials. It is found that
these rubber-like incompressible materials may be compressed more than ""Bell

the inner 9 kpc of the iconic spiral galaxy M51 to examine the effect of gas
streaming motions on the star-forming properties of individual GMCs. We compare
our view of gas flows in M51 -- which arise due to departures from axi-symmetry
in the gravitational potential (i.e. the nuclear bar and spiral arms) -- with
the global pattern of star formation as traced by Halpha and 24\mu m emission.
We find that the dynamical environment of GMCs strongly affects their ability
to form stars, in the sense that GMCs situated in regions with large streaming
motions can be stabilized, while similarly massive GMCs in regions without
streaming go on to efficiently form stars. We argue that this is the result of
reduced surface pressure felt by clouds embedded in an ambient medium
undergoing large streaming motions, which prevents collapse. Indeed, the
variation in gas depletion time expected based on the observed streaming
motions throughout the disk of M51 quantitatively agrees with the variation in
observed gas depletion time scale. The example of M51 shows that streaming
motions, triggered by gravitational instabilities in the form of bars and
spiral arms, can alter the star formation law; this can explain the variation
in gas depletion time among galaxies with different masses and morphologies. In
particular, we can explain the long gas depletion times in spiral galaxies
compared to dwarf galaxies and starbursts. We suggest that adding a dynamical
pressure term to the canonical free-fall time produces a single star formation
law that can be applied to all star-forming regions and galaxies, across cosmic
time.

with a constant gradient $\alpha$ and the ensuing evolution preserves the
homogeneity of the cosmological principle. After we discuss the properties of
background evolution including an exact solution for the exponential-type
potential, we investigate the linear perturbations of the scalar and tensor
modes in the background of the slow-roll inflation. In our model with small
$\alpha$, the comoving wavenumber has {\it a lower bound} $\sim \alpha M_{\rm
P}$ to have well-defined initial quantum states. We find that cosmological
quantities, for instance, the power spectrums and spectral indices of the
comoving curvature and isocurvature perturbations, and the running of the
spectral indices have small corrections depending on {\it the lower bound}.
Similar behaviors happen for the tensor perturbation with the same lower bound.

be limited mostly by the finite decoherence rates of the individual qubits and
quantum gates. Recently, substantial progress was achieved in enhancing the
time within which a solid-state qubit demonstrates coherent dynamics. This
progress is based mostly on a successful isolation of the qubits from external
decoherence sources obtained by clever engineering. Under these conditions, the
material-inherent sources of noise start to play a crucial role. In most cases,
quantum devices are affected by noise decreasing with frequency, f,
approximately as 1/f. According to the present point of view, such noise is due
to material- and device-specific microscopic degrees of freedom interacting
with quantum variables of the nanodevice. The simplest picture is that the
environment that destroys the phase coherence of the device can be thought of
as a system of two-state fluctuators, which experience random hops between
their states. If the hopping times are distributed in a exponentially broad
domain, the resulting fluctuations have a spectrum close to 1/f in a large
frequency range. In this paper we review the current state of the theory of
decoherence due to degrees of freedom producing 1/f noise. We discuss basic
mechanisms of such noises in various nanodevices and then review several models
describing the interaction of the noise sources with quantum devices. The main
focus of the review is to analyze how the 1/f noise destroys their coherent
operation. We start from individual qubits concentrating mostly on the devices
based on superconductor circuits, and then discuss some special issues related
to more complicated architectures. Finally, we consider several strategies for
minimizing the noise-induced decoherence.

detectable in HIPASS at the observed distances if they were isolated, but are
detected in SINGG narrow-band imaging due to their membership of groups with
sufficiently large total HI mass. The ELGs in these groups are similar to the
wider SINGG sample in terms of size, H{\alpha} equivalent width, and surface
brightness. Eight of these groups have two large spiral galaxies with several
dwarf galaxies and may be thought of as morphological analogues of the Local

suggesting that they are at an early stage of assembly, and more like the M81
group. The Choir groups are very compact at typically only 190 kpc in projected
distance between the two brightest members. They are very similar to SINGG

induced because of the torsion. The world-volume components of the matter

deformation in the austenite caused by the MT interacts with the pre-deformed
plastic strain that leads to the inhomogeneous increasing of the total
dislocation density. During the phase transformation one part of the
dislocations in the pre-deformed austenite is inherited by the martensitic

a phenomenological dependency of the inherited dislocations on the martensitic

models relate to each other. In particular it is hard to distinguish between
generic properties and peculiarities due to the abstracted model. Here we
present a unified view on pairwise covariances in recurrent networks in the
irregular regime. We consider the binary neuron model, the leaky
integrate-and-fire model, and the Hawkes process. We show that linear
approximation maps each of these models to either of two classes of linear rate
models, including the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process as a special case. The classes
differ in the location of additive noise in the rate dynamics, which is on the
output side for spiking models and on the input side for the binary model. Both
classes allow closed form solutions for the covariance. For output noise it
separates into an echo term and a term due to correlated input. The unified
framework enables us to transfer results between models. For example, we
generalize the binary model and the Hawkes process to the presence of
conduction delays and simplify derivations for established results. Our
approach is applicable to general network structures and suitable for
population averages. The derived averages are exact for fixed out-degree
network architectures and approximate for fixed in-degree. We demonstrate how
taking into account fluctuations in the linearization procedure increases the
accuracy of the effective theory and we explain the class dependent differences
between covariances in the time and the frequency domain. Finally we show that
the oscillatory instability emerging in networks of integrate-and-fire models
with delayed inhibitory feedback is a model-invariant feature: the same
structure of poles in the complex frequency plane determines the population
power spectra.

between two systems corresponding to vertices and edges. In this framework,
cospectral graphs correspond exactly to local unitarily equivalent pure states.
Finally, we introduce the notion of coentropic graphs, that is, graphs with
equal von Neumann entropy. The smallest coentropic (but not cospectral) graphs
that we are able to construct have 8 vertices. The number of equivalence

the number of (pure) bipartite entanglement classes with subsystems of

23 geomagnetic storm on 20 November 2003. Analysis of a complete data set, not
considered before, reveals a chain of eruptions to which hard X-ray and
microwave bursts responded. A filament in AR 10501 was not a passive part of a
larger flux rope, as usually considered. The filament erupted and gave origin
to a CME. The chain of events was as follows: i) an eruption at 07:29
accompanied by a not reported M1.2 class flare associated with the onset of a
first southeastern CME1, which is not responsible for the superstorm; ii) a
confined eruption at 07:41 (M3.2 flare) that destabilized the filament; iii)
the filament acceleration (07:56); iv) the bifurcation of the eruptive filament
that transformed into a large cloud; v) an M3.9 flare in AR 10501 associated to
this transformation. The transformation of the filament could be due to its
interaction with the magnetic field in the neighborhood of a null point,
located at a height of about 100 Mm above the complex formed by ARs 10501,
10503, and their environment. The CORONAS-F/SPIRIT telescope observed the cloud
in 304 A as a large Y-shaped darkening, which moved from the bifurcation region
to the limb. The masses and kinematics of the cloud and the filament were
similar. Remnants of the filament were not observed in the second southwestern
CME2, previously regarded as a source of the 20 November superstorm. These
facts do not support a simple scenario, in which the interplanetary magnetic
cloud is considered as a flux rope formed from a structure initially associated
with the pre-eruption filament in AR 10501. Observations suggest a possible
additional eruption above the bifurcation region close to solar disk center
between 08:07 and 08:17 that could be the source of the superstorm.

coupled to the charge as well as the dipole moment of the baryons by including
the appropriate terms in the Lagrangian density. The saturation density of
magnetized, symmetric nuclear matter was calculated for magnetic fields of the

binding energy, symmetry energy coefficient and compressibility of nuclear

the saturation density increases, while the system becomes less bound.
Furthermore, the depopulation of proton Landau levels leaves a distinct
fluctuating imprint on the symmetry energy coefficient and compressibility. The
calculations were also performed for increased values of the baryon magnetic
dipole moment. By increasing the dipole moment strength the saturation density
is found to decrease, but the system becomes more tightly bound while the

patients the hepatitis virus mutates and gives rise to variants which are drug
resistant. We conjecture that combination therapy is able to delay drug
resistance for a longer time than sequential monotherapy. To study the action
of these two therapeutic approaches in the event of unknown mutations and to
explain the emergence of drug resistance, we propose a stochastic model for the
infection within a patient which is treated with two drugs, either sequentially
or contemporaneously, and develops a two-step mutation which is resistant to
both drugs. We study the deterministic approximation of our stochastic model
and give a biological interpretation of its asymptotic behaviour. We compare
the time when this new strain first reaches detectability in the serum viral
load. Our results show that the best choice is to start an early combination
therapy, which allows to stay drug-resistance free for a longer time.

Here, we
develop a general theoretical framework that provides a way to achieve precise

Poisson or supra-Poisson noise, precise control is not possible. If, however,
the control signal has sub-Poisson noise, then precise control is possible. For
this case, the precise control solution is not a function, but a rapidly
varying random process that must be averaged with respect to a governing
probability density functional. Our theoretical approach is applied to the
control of straight-trajectory arm movement. Sub-Poisson noise in the control
signal is shown to be capable of leading to precise control. Intriguingly, the
control signal for this system has a natural counterpart, namely the bursting
pulses of neurons --trains of Dirac-delta functions-- in biological systems to
achieve precise control performance.

  Buffer-aided Relay Networks","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1303.3732",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider the problem of sum rate maximization in a
bidirectional relay network with fading. Hereby, user 1 and user 2 communicate
with each other only through a relay, i.e., a direct link between user 1 and
user 2 is not present. In this network, there exist six possible transmission
modes: four point-to-point modes (user 1-to-relay, user 2-to-relay,
relay-to-user 1, relay-to-user 2), a multiple access mode (both users to the
relay), and a broadcast mode (the relay to both users). Most existing protocols
assume a fixed schedule of using a subset of the aforementioned transmission
modes, as a result, the sum rate is limited by the capacity of the weakest link
associated with the relay in each time slot. Motivated by this limitation, we
develop a protocol which is not restricted to adhere to a predefined schedule
for using the transmission modes. Therefore, all transmission modes of the
bidirectional relay network can be used adaptively based on the instantaneous
channel state information (CSI) of the involved links. To this end, the relay
has to be equipped with two buffers for the storage of the information received
from users 1 and 2, respectively. For the considered network, given a total
average power budget for all nodes, we jointly optimize the transmission mode
selection and power allocation based on the instantaneous CSI in each time slot
for sum rate maximization. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol
outperforms existing protocols for all signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).
Specifically, we obtain a considerable gain at low SNRs due to the adaptive
power allocation and at high SNRs due to the adaptive mode selection.

represents a significant advance in the field of quantitative analysis of
migration patterns. Official and commercial records are often access
restricted, incompatible between countries, and especially not registered
across researchers. Instead, we introduce GeoDBLP where we propagate
geographical seed locations retrieved from the web across the DBLP database of
1,080,958 authors and 1,894,758 papers. But perhaps more important is that we
are able to find statistical patterns and create models that explain the
migration of researchers. For instance, we show that the science job market can
be treated as a Poisson process with individual propensities to migrate
following a log-normal distribution over the researcher's career stage. That
is, although jobs enter the market constantly, researchers are generally not
""memoryless"" but have to care greatly about their next move. The propensity to
make k>1 migrations, however, follows a gamma distribution suggesting that
migration at later career stages is ""memoryless"". This aligns well but actually
goes beyond scientometric models typically postulated based on small case
studies. On a very large, transnational scale, we establish the first general
regularities that should have major implications on strategies for education

is proportional to the capacitance of a thin conducting slab in the shape of A
in d+1-dimensional electrostatics, and give explicit formulae for this when A
is the interior of a sphere S^{d-1} or an ellipsoid. For spherical regions in
d=2 and 3 we obtain explicit results for C^n for all n and hence for the
leading term in the mutual information by taking n->1. We also compute a
universal logarithmic correction to the area law for the Renyi entropies of a
single spherical region for a scalar field theory with a small mass.

in debate. In the N-body simulations a cuspy dark matter halo density profile
is favored. Several dissipative baryonic processes however are found to be able
to significantly flatten dark matter distribution and a cored dark matter halo
density profile is possible. The baryons dominate the gravitational potential
in the inner Galaxy, hence a direct constrain on the abundance of the dark
matter particles is rather challenging. Recently, a few groups have identified
a tentative 130 GeV line signal in the Galactic center, which could be
interpreted as the signal of the dark matter annihilation. With current 130 GeV
line data and adopting the generalized Navarro-Frenk-White profile of the dark
matter halo, for local dark matter density \rho_0=0.4 GeV cm^{-3} and r_s=20
kpc we obtain a 95% confidence level lower (upper) limit on the inner slope of
dark matter density distribution \alpha = 1.06 (the cross section of dark
matter annihilation into gamma-rays <\sigma v >_{\chi\chi -> \gamma\gamma}=
1.3\times 10^{-27} cm^3 s^{-1}). Such a slope is consistent with the results of
some N-body simulations, and if the signal is due to dark matter, suggests that
baryonic processes may be unimportant.

specifically sensitive to the hydrogen bond interactions and provides a wealth
of information on the structural and dynamical properties of the water
contained in the pores of the matrix. We investigate systematically this
spectral region of Vycor porous silica (pore size about 4 nm) for a series of
samples at different levels of hydration, from the dry matrix to completely
filled pores. The spectra are obtained as the Fourier transforms of
time-resolved heterodyne detected optical Kerr effect (HD- OKE) measurements.
The comparison of these spectra with that of bulk water allows us to extract
and analyze separately the spectral contributions of the first and second
hydration layers, as well as that of bulk-like inner water. We conclude that
the extra water entering the pores above 10 % water/silica weight ratio behaves
very similarly to bulk water. At lower levels of hydration, corresponding to
two complete superficial water layers or less, the H-bond bending and
stretching bands, characteristic of the tetrahedral coordination of water in
the bulk phase, progressively disappear: clearly in these conditions the H-bond
connectivity is very different from that of liquid water. A similar behavior is
observed for the structural relaxation times, measured from the decay of the
time-dependent HD-OKE signal. The value for the inner water is very similar to
that of the bulk liquid; that of the first two water layers is definitely
longer by about a factor 4. These findings should be carefully taken into
account when employing pore confinement to extend towards lower temperatures
the accessible temperature range of supercooled water.

interest (e.g., cell or tissue), and it searches for a flux consistent
subnetwork of the global network that contains all reactions from the core set
and a minimal set of additional reactions. Our key observation is that a
minimal consistent reconstruction can be defined via a set of sparse modes of
the global network, and FASTCORE iteratively computes such a set via a series
of linear programs. Experiments on liver data demonstrate speedups of several
orders of magnitude, and significantly more compact reconstructions, over a
chief rival method. Given its simplicity and its excellent performance,
FASTCORE can form the backbone of many future metabolic network reconstruction
algorithms.

daunting task. New observational information has the potential to lead to major
strides in understanding the acceleration site parameters. Detection of
molecular carbon monoxide (CO) in TeV emitting blazars, however, implies the
existence of intrinsic gas, a connection often found in photo-dissociated
region models and numerical simulations. The existence of intrinsic gas within
a blazar could provide a target photon field for Compton up-scattering of
photons to TeV energies by relativistic particles. We investigate the possible
existence of intrinsic gas within the three TeV emitting blazars RGB J0710+591,
W Comae and 1ES 1959+650 which have measurements or upper limits on molecular
CO line luminosity using an independent technique which is based on the
spectral analysis of soft X-rays. Evidence for X-ray absorption by additional
gas beyond that measured within the Milky Way is searched for in Swift X-ray
Telescope (XRT) data between 0.3 and 10 keV. Without complementary information
from another measurement, additional absorption could be misinterpreted as an
intrinsically curved X-ray spectrum since both models can frequently fit the
soft X-ray data. After breaking this degeneracy, we do not find evidence for
intrinsically curved spectra for any of the three blazars. Moreover, no
evidence for intrinsic gas is evident for RGB J0710+591 and W Comae, while the
1ES 1959+650 XRT data support the existence of intrinsic gas with a column
density of $\sim1\times10^{21}$cm$^{-2}$.

of the thermal neutron induced fission of U 233, U 235 and Pu 239,

interaction energy between complementary fragments (Coulomb effect). In order
to avoid the erosive consequences of neutron emission, one studies the cold
fission regions, corresponding to total kinetic energy (TE) close to the
maximum available energy of the reaction (Q). Contrary to expected, in cold
fission is not observed high odd-even effect in mass number distribution.
Nevertheless, the measured values are compatible with higher odd-even effects
on proton or neutron number distribution, respectively. In addition, in cold
fission, the minimal total excitation energy (X) is correlated with the Coulomb
energy excess, which is defined as the difference between C (the electrostatic
interaction energy between complementary fragments taken as spherical in
scission configuration) and Q. These Coulomb effects increase with the
asymmetry of the charge fragmentations. In sum, the experimental data on cold
fission suggest that scission configurations explore all the possibilities
permitted by the available energy for fission.

take a new approach which is based on finding a set of paths that may not be

consider the problem of finding the minimum number of survivable paths. In
particular, we focus on two versions of this problem: one where the length of a
path is restricted, and the other where the number of paths sharing a fiber is
restricted. We prove that in general, finding the minimum survivable path set
is NP-hard, whereas both of the restricted versions of the problem can be
solved in polynomial time. We formulate the problem as Integer Linear Programs
(ILPs), and use these formulations to develop heuristics and approximation
algorithms. Next, we consider the problem of finding a set of survivable paths

general, and develop heuristics and approximation algorithms with provable
approximation bounds. Finally, we present simulation results comparing the

groups have explored the possibility of observing signals of dark matter from
its interactions with the high-energy jets emanating from these galaxies. In

the WIMP-induced gamma ray spectrum of active galactic nuclei; namely, (1) the
continuum from WIMP annihilation into light standard model states which
subsequently radiate and/or decay into photons and (2) the direct
(loop-induced) decay into photons. We work in the context of models of
universal extra dimensions (in particular, a model with two extra dimensions)

interesting features which may be observable with the Fermi gamma ray

exchange interaction between the molecular magnet and the quantum dot modifies
the Andreev states due to a spin-dependent renormalization of the quantum dot's

central region of the quantum dot and the molecular magnet further tunes the

use a non-equilibrium Green's function approach to evaluate the transport
properties of the junction. Our calculations reveal that the energy level of
the dot, the magnetic field and the exchange interaction between the molecular
magnet and the electrons occupying the energy level of the quantum dot can
trigger transitions from a 0 to a $\pi$ state of the Josephson junction. The
redistribution of the occupied states induced by the magnetic field strongly
modifies the current-phase relation. The critical current exhibits a sharp
increase as a function of either the energy level of the dot, the magnetic

of fractal analysis, Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA), in the analysis of
the dynamics of animal behavior time series. In order to correctly use DFA to
assess the presence of long-range correlation, previous authors using
statistical model systems have stated that different aspects should be taken
into account such as: 1) the establishment by hypothesis testing of the absence
of short term correlation, 2) an accurate estimation of a straight line in the
log-log plot of the fluctuation function, 3) the elimination of artificial
crossovers in the fluctuation function, and 4) the length of the time series.
Taking into consideration these factors, herein we evaluated the presence of
long-range correlation in the temporal pattern of locomotor activity of
Japanese quail ({\sl Coturnix coturnix}) and mosquito larva ({\sl Culex
quinquefasciatus}). In our study, modeling the data with the general ARFIMA
model, we rejected the hypothesis of short range correlations (d=0) in all
cases. We also observed that DFA was able to distinguish between the artificial
crossover observed in the temporal pattern of locomotion of Japanese quail, and
the crossovers in the correlation behavior observed in mosquito larvae
locomotion. Although the test duration can slightly influence the parameter
estimation, no qualitative differences were observed between different test
durations.

dubbed El Ni\~no by Peruvian fishermen, has major (and occasionally
devastating) impacts around the globe, robust forecasting is still limited to
about six months ahead. A significant extension of the pre-warming time would
be instrumental for avoiding some of the worst damages such as harvest failures
in developing countries. Here we introduce a novel avenue towards El
Ni\~no-prediction based on network methods inspecting emerging teleconnections.
Our approach starts from the evidence that a large-scale cooperative mode -
linking the El Ni\~no-basin (equatorial Pacific corridor) and the rest of the
ocean - builds up in the calendar year before the warming event. On this basis,
we can develop an efficient 12 months-forecasting scheme, i.e., achieve some
doubling of the early-warning period. Our method is based on high-quality
observational data as available since 1950 and yields hit rates above 0.5,
while false-alarm rates are below 0.1.

vapour deposition on polycrystalline copper is investigated with the use of a
polar and a non-polar pressure transmitting medium (PTM). The G and 2D Raman
bands exhibit similar pressure slopes for both PTM irrespectively of any
unintentional initial doping and/or strain of the samples. Our analysis
suggests that any pressure-induced charge transfer effects are negligibly small
to influence the pressure response of graphene. This is determined by the
mechanical stress due to the pressure-induced substrate contraction and the
transfer efficiency of the latter to the graphene layer, as well as the
PTM-graphene interaction. For the non-polar PTM, a peculiar pressure behavior
of graphene is observed in the PTM solidification regime, resembling that of
free standing graphene.

further shown that for certain values of the bulk and shear viscosity and

LDA+$U$ densities of states. In contrast to Mn/CuN and Fe/CuN, the cobalt
system tends to form the electronic excitations at the Fermi level. Based on
the calculated magnetic response functions, the relative relaxation times for
the magnetic moments of impurity orbitals are estimated. To study the effect of
the dynamical correlations on the exchange interaction in nanoclusters, we
solve the two-impurity Anderson model for the Mn dimer on the CuN surface. It
is found that the experimental exchange interaction can be well reproduced by
employing $U$=3 eV, which is two times smaller than the value used in static
mean-field LDA+$U$ calculations. This suggests on important role of dynamical
correlations in the interaction between adatoms on a surface.

a small number of resonance modes. We use the formalism to revisit Purcell's

particular, it predicts that a spectral detuning between the emitter and the

of dissipation. Comparisons with fully-vectorial numerical calculations for
plasmonic nanoresonators made of gold nanorods evidence the high accuracy of
the predictions achieved by our semi-analytical treatment.

studying the convex hull of the set of $\lie{h}$-weights $\wt(\V)$ in their own

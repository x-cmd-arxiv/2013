introduce the concept of projective Osserman manifold in both the affine and in
the pseudo-Riemannian settings. If M is an affine projective Osserman manifold,
then the modified Riemannian extension metric on the cotangent bundle is both
spacelike and timelike projective Osserman. Since any rank 1 symmetric space is
affine projective Osserman, this provides additional information concerning the
cotangent bundle of a rank 1 Riemannian symmetric space with the modified
Riemannian extension metric. We construct other examples of affine projective
Osserman manifolds where the Ricci tensor is not symmetric and thus the
connection is not the Levi-Civita connection of any metric. If M is an affine
projective Osserman manifold of odd dimension, we use methods of algebraic
topology to show the Jacobi operator has only one non-zero eigenvalue and that
eigenvalue is real.

is indicated by the profile of its tissue HM concentrations (Cp) versus the
concentration of the HM in the substrate (Cs). We report a systems biology
approach to the modelling of the Cp- Cs profile using as loose analogy, the
Verhulst model of population dynamics but formulated in the concentration
domain. The HM is conceptualized as an ecological organism that `colonizes' the
resource zone of the plant cells driven by the potential supplied by the higher
HM concentration in the substrate. The infinite occupation by the HM is limited
by the eventual saturation of the cellular binding sites. The solution of the
differential equation results in the logistic equation, the r-K model. The
model is tested for 3 metalophillic plants T.erecta, S. vulgaris and E.
splendens growing in different types of substrates, contaminated to varying
extents by different copper compounds. The model fitted the experimental Cp- Cs
profiles well. The r, K parameter values and secondary quantities derived from
them, allowed a quantification of the number of Cu binding sites per cell at
saturation, the sensitivities (affinities) of these sites for Cu in the 3
experimental systems as well as the extraction of information related to the
substrate phyto-availability of the Cu. Thus even though the model operates at
the systems level it permits useful insights into underlying processes that
ultimately derive from the cumulative molecular processes of HM homeostasis.
The chief advantages of the model are its simplicity, fewer arbitrary
parameters, and the non-specification of constraints on substrate and plant
type.

scaling Kashaev limit (the one associated with the volume conjecture) dominant
in the genus expansion are terms associated with the symmetric representations

$D'=(V,A\setminus (X\cup \sigma(X))$. In this paper, we give an algorithm for
this problem which runs in time $O((4d)^{k}(m+n+\ell))$, where $m$ is the

of the family given in the input.
  Using our algorithm, we show that Almost 2-SAT has an algorithm with running
time $O(4^kk^4\ell)$ and we obtain algorithms for {\sc Odd Cycle Transversal}
and {\sc Edge Bipartization} which run in time $O(4^kk^4(m+n))$ and
$O(4^kk^5(m+n))$ respectively. This resolves an open problem posed by Reed,
Smith and Vetta [Operations Research Letters, 2003] and improves upon the
earlier almost linear time algorithm of Kawarabayashi and Reed [SODA, 2010].
  We also show that Deletion q-Horn Backdoor Set Detection is a special case of
3-Skew-Symmetric Multicut, giving us an algorithm for Deletion q-Horn Backdoor
Set Detection which runs in time $O(12^kk^5\ell)$. This gives the first
fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for this problem answering a question posed
in a paper by a superset of the authors [STACS, 2013]. Using this result, we
get an algorithm for Satisfiability which runs in time $O(12^kk^5\ell)$ where
$k$ is the size of the smallest q-Horn deletion backdoor set, with $\ell$ being
the length of the input formula.

associated with insulating and conducting behaviour. Generically a neutral
plasma in clean materials can be described by a tight binding model with a
strong spin-orbit interaction. A system of that type has a vanishing DC
conductivity; however the current response to the DC field is very slow: the
current decays with time in a powerwise manner, different from an insulator.
The AC conductivity, in addition to a finite real part which is linear in
frequency, exhibits an imaginary part that increases logarithmically as
function of the UV cutoff (atomic scale). This leads to substantial dielectric
response like a large dielectric constant at low frequencies. This is in
contrast to a 2D Weyl semimetal like graphene at neutrality point where the AC
conductivity is purely pseudo-dissipative. The Coulomb interaction between
electrons is long range and sufficiently strong to make a significant impact on
transport. The interaction contribution to the AC conductivity is calculated
within the tight binding model.

the cell sites are connected to a cloud-computing-based central processor (CP)

compress-and-forward scheme in which the base-stations(BSs) quantize the
received signals and send the quantized signals to the CP using either
distributed Wyner-Ziv coding or single-user compression. The CP decodes the
quantization codewords first, then decodes the user messages as if the remote
users and the cloud center form a virtual multiple-access channel (VMAC). This
paper formulates the problem of optimizing the quantization noise levels for
weighted sum rate maximization under a sum backhaul capacity constraint. We
propose an alternating convex optimization approach to find a local optimum
solution to the problem efficiently, and more importantly, establish that
setting the quantization noise levels to be proportional to the background
noise levels is near optimal for sum-rate maximization when the
signal-to-quantization-noise ratio (SQNR) is high. In addition, with Wyner-Ziv
coding, the approximate quantization noise level is shown to achieve the
sum-capacity of the uplink C-RAN model to within a constant gap. With
single-user compression, a similar constant-gap result is obtained under a
diagonal dominant channel condition. These results lead to an efficient
algorithm for allocating the backhaul capacities in C-RAN. The performance of
the proposed scheme is evaluated for practical multicell and heterogeneous
networks. It is shown that multicell processing with optimized quantization
noise levels across the BSs can significantly improve the performance of
wireless cellular networks.

micromachined devices, the relationship between electronic properties and
original structure is revealed. By combining transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) and current-voltage (I-V) spectroscopy studies performed on several
symmetric and asymmetric HNWs structures, we show that rectifying I-V
characteristics are observed only for asymmetric HNWs. Moreover, it is shown
that the rectification ratio can be improved up to 3 orders of magnitude by a
proper selection of the HNW composition. While the rectifying behavior is
observed in HNWs after oxidative or acid doping, the charge transport mechanism
in as-synthesized HNWs is bulk-limited and independent from their structure.
Both symmetric and asymmetric HNWs exhibit Ohmic and non-linear I-V curves
above and below T~120 K, respectively. These electrical behaviors are
consistent with a smooth transition from an Ohmic to a non-Ohmic
variable-range-hopping (VRH) mechanism. We discuss the origin of these
nonlinearities comparing the two- and four-probe measurements on single HNWs
and we propose a simple model based on dual back-to-back Schottky diodes to
explain qualitatively the rectifying properties.

topology may be arbitrary or modeled by a random spatial distribution for a
fixed number of base stations and mobiles placed over a finite area with the
separations among them constrained to exceed a minimum distance. The analysis
is more detailed and accurate than existing ones and facilitates the resolution
of network design issues, including the influence of the minimum base-station
separation, the role of the spreading factor, and the impact of various
power-control and rate-control policies. It is shown that once power control is
established, the rate can be allocated according to a fixed-rate or
variable-rate policy with the objective of either meeting an outage constraint
or maximizing throughput. An advantage of the variable-rate policy is that it
allows an outage constraint to be enforced on every uplink, whereas the

advancements to allow for a consistent quality description of excited-state

application to Azobenzene adsorbed on Ag(111) and Au(111) surfaces. We find
that the explicit inclusion of substrate electronic states modifies the
topologies of intra-molecular excited-state PESs of the molecule due to image
charge and hybridization effects. While the molecule in gas phase shows a clear
energetic separation of resonances that induce isomerization and backreaction,
the surface-adsorbed molecule does not. The concomitant possibly simultaneous

provided in a semi-supervised manner, about a specific target region of a large
data set, and one wants to perform machine learning and data analysis tasks
""nearby"" that prespecified target region. For example, one might be interested
in the clustering structure of a data graph near a prespecified ""seed set"" of
nodes, or one might be interested in finding partitions in an image that are
near a prespecified ""ground truth"" set of pixels. Locally-biased problems of
this sort are particularly challenging for popular eigenvector-based machine
learning and data analysis tools. At root, the reason is that eigenvectors are
inherently global quantities, thus limiting the applicability of
eigenvector-based methods in situations where one is interested in very local
properties of the data.
  In this paper, we address this issue by providing a methodology to construct
semi-supervised eigenvectors of a graph Laplacian, and we illustrate how these
locally-biased eigenvectors can be used to perform locally-biased machine
learning. These semi-supervised eigenvectors capture
successively-orthogonalized directions of maximum variance, conditioned on
being well-correlated with an input seed set of nodes that is assumed to be
provided in a semi-supervised manner. We show that these semi-supervised
eigenvectors can be computed quickly as the solution to a system of linear
equations; and we also describe several variants of our basic method that have
improved scaling properties. We provide several empirical examples
demonstrating how these semi-supervised eigenvectors can be used to perform
locally-biased learning; and we discuss the relationship between our results
and recent machine learning algorithms that use global eigenvectors of the
graph Laplacian.

  Problems","To appear in ICALP 2013",,,,"cs.DS cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Moss and Rabani[12] study constrained node-weighted Steiner tree problems
with two independent weight values associated with each node, namely, cost and
prize (or penalty). They give an O(log n)-approximation algorithm for the
prize-collecting node-weighted Steiner tree problem (PCST). They use the
algorithm for PCST to obtain a bicriteria (2, O(log n))-approximation algorithm
for the Budgeted node-weighted Steiner tree problem. Their solution may cost up
to twice the budget, but collects a factor Omega(1/log n) of the optimal prize.
We improve these results from at least two aspects.
  Our first main result is a primal-dual O(log h)-approximation algorithm for a
more general problem, prize-collecting node-weighted Steiner forest, where we
have (h) demands each requesting the connectivity of a pair of vertices. Our
algorithm can be seen as a greedy algorithm which reduces the number of demands
by choosing a structure with minimum cost-to-reduction ratio. This natural
style of argument (also used by Klein and Ravi[10] and Guha et al.[8]) leads to
a much simpler algorithm than that of Moss and Rabani[12] for PCST.
  Our second main contribution is for the Budgeted node-weighted Steiner tree
problem, which is also an improvement to [12] and [8]. In the unrooted case, we
improve upon an O(log^2(n))-approximation of [8], and present an O(log
n)-approximation algorithm without any budget violation. For the rooted case,
where a specified vertex has to appear in the solution tree, we improve the
bicriteria result of [12] to a bicriteria approximation ratio of (1+eps, O(log
n)/(eps^2)) for any positive (possibly subconstant) (eps). That is, for any
permissible budget violation (1+eps), we present an algorithm achieving a
tradeoff in the guarantee for prize. Indeed, we show that this is almost tight
for the natural linear-programming relaxation used by us as well as in [12].

EUV channel structure in the images of high temperature passbands of the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly prior to the CME eruption. Through fitting their
height evolution with a function consisting of linear and exponential
components, we determine the onset time of the FR impulsive acceleration with
high temporal accuracy for the first time. Using this onset time, we divide the
evolution of the FRs in the low corona into two phases: a slow rise phase and
an impulsive acceleration phase. In the slow rise phase of the FR1, the
appearance of sporadic EUV and UV brightening and the strong shearing along the
polarity inverse line indicates that the quasi-separatrix-layer reconnection
likely initiates the slow rise. On the other hand for the FR2, we mainly
contribute its slow rise to the FR1 eruption, which partially opened the
overlying field and thus decreased the magnetic restriction. At the onset of
the impulsive acceleration phase, the FR1 (FR2) reaches the critical height of
84.4$\pm$11.2 Mm (86.2$\pm$13.0 Mm) where the decline of the overlying field
with height is fast enough to trigger the torus instability. After a very short
interval ($\sim$2 minutes), the flare emission began to enhance. These results
reveal the compound activity involving multiple magnetic FRs and further
suggest that the ideal torus instability probably plays the essential role of
initiating the impulsive acceleration of CMEs.

circles for near-integrable maps, but far from the integrable case all circles
can be destroyed. A standard method for determining the existence or
nonexistence of a circle, Greene's residue criterion, requires the computation
of long-period orbits, which can be difficult if the map has no reversing
symmetry. We use de la Llave's quasi-Newton, Fourier-based scheme to
numerically compute the conjugacy of a Diophantine circle conjugate to rigid
rotation, and the singularity of a norm of a derivative of the conjugacy to
predict criticality. We study near-critical conjugacies for families of
rotational invariant circles in generalizations of Chirikov's standard map.
  A first goal is to obtain evidence to support the long-standing conjecture
that when circles breakup they form cantori, as is known for twist maps by
Aubry-Mather theory. The location of the largest gaps is compared to the maxima
of the potential when anti-integrable theory applies. A second goal is to
support the conjecture that locally most robust circles have noble rotation
numbers, even when the map is not reversible. We show that relative robustness
varies inversely with the discriminant for rotation numbers in quadratic
algebraic fields. Finally, we observe that the rotation number of the globally
most robust circle generically appears to be a piecewise-constant function in
two-parameter families of maps.

[1]) we focus on lower dimensions -- the 1D lattice of instantons in a harmonic
potential V M_2^2x_2^2+M_3^2x_2^2+M_4^2x_4^2 and the zigzag-shaped lattice as a
first stage of the 1D->2D transition. We prove that in the low- and
moderate-density regimes, interactions between the instantons are dominated by
two-body forces. This drastically simplifies finding the ground state of the
instantons' orientations, so we made a numeric scan of the whole orientation
space instead of assuming any particular ansatz.
  We find that depending on the M_2/M_3/M_4 ratios, the ground state of
instanton orientations can follow a wide variety of patterns. For the straight
1D lattices, we found orientations periodically running over elements of a Z_2,
Klein, prismatic, or dihedral subgroup of the SU(2)/Z_2, as well as irrational
but link-periodic patterns. For the zigzag-shaped lattices, we detected 4
distinct orientation phases -- the anti-ferromagnet, another abelian phase, and
two non-abelian phases. Allowing the zigzag amplitude to vary as a function of
increasing compression force, we obtained the phase diagram for the straight
and zigzag-shaped lattices in the (force, M_3/M_4), (chemical potential,
M_3/M_4), and (density, M_3/M_4) planes. Some of the transitions between these

particles, anisotropic interactions arising from patterned coatings,

for directional binding of particles into higher-ordered structures. Although
the anisotropic geometry of non-spherical particles contributes to the
interaction patchiness through van der Waals, electrostatic, and other
interactions, how particle shape contributes entropically to self-assembly is
only now beginning to be understood. It has been recently demonstrated that,
for hard shapes, entropic forces are directional. A newly proposed theoretical
framework that defines and quantifies directional entropic forces demonstrates
the anisotropic--that is, patchy--nature of these emergent, attractive forces.
Here we introduce the notion of entropically patchy particles as the entropic
counterpart to enthalpically patchy particles. Using three example ""families""
of shapes, we judiciously modify entropic patchiness by introducing geometric
features to the particles so as to target specific crystal structures, which
then assembled with Monte Carlo simulations. We quantify the emergent entropic
valence via a potential of mean force and torque. We generalize these shape
operations to shape anisotropy dimensions, in analogy with the anisotropy
dimensions introduced for enthalpically patchy particles. Our findings
demonstrate that entropic patchiness and emergent valence provide a way of
engineering directional bonding into nanoparticle systems, whether in the

symmetry than the underlying Hamiltonian, is ubiquitous in physics. It leads to
multiply-degenerate ground states, each with a different ""broken"" symmetry
labeled by an order parameter. The variation of this order parameter in space
leads to soliton-like features at the boundaries of different broken-symmetry
regions and also to topological point defects. Bilayer graphene is a
fascinating realization of this physics, with an order parameter given by its
interlayer stacking coordinate. Bilayer graphene has been a subject of intense
study because in the presence of a perpendicular electric field, a band gap
appears in its electronic spectrum [1-3] through a mechanism that is intimately
tied to its broken symmetry. Theorists have further proposed that novel
electronic states exist at the boundaries between broken-symmetry stacking
domains [4-5]. However, very little is known about the structural properties of
these boundaries. Here we use electron microscopy to measure with nanoscale and
atomic resolution the widths, motion, and topological structure of soliton
boundaries and topological defects in bilayer graphene. We find that each
soliton consists of an atomic-scale registry shift between the two graphene
layers occurring over 6-11 nm. We infer the minimal energy barrier to
interlayer translation and observe soliton motion during in-situ heating above
1000 {\deg}C. The abundance of these structures across a variety samples, as
well as their unusual properties, suggests that they will have substantial
effects on the electronic and mechanical properties of bilayer graphene.

under a certain formalization of the predictive payoff for the algorithm it is
most optimal for the adversary to produce a fractal-like sequence to minimize

higher deviations than expected for a completely random walk.

respect to a set of experts. For example if we measure performance with respect
to two constant experts one that always predicts 0's and another that always
predicts 1's it is well known that one can get regret $O(\sqrt T)$ with respect
to the best expert by using, say, the weighted majority algorithm. But this
algorithm does not provide performance guarantee in any interval. There are
other algorithms that ensure regret $O(\sqrt {x \log T})$ in any interval of
length $x$. In this paper we show a randomized algorithm that in an amortized
sense gets a regret of $O(\sqrt x)$ for any interval when the sequence is
partitioned into intervals arbitrarily. We empirically estimated the constant
in the $O()$ for $T$ upto 2000 and found it to be small -- around 2.1. We also

results show that using NC improves the layered video performance in single and

interface theory from [14]) for modular synthesis and verification of real-time
systems with critical timing constraints. It is a further step of our earlier
work [10] which achieved an elegant algebraic specification theory for
real-time systems endowed with the capability to freeze time. In this paper we
relinquish such (unrealisable) capability and target more realistic systems
without the ability to stop time.
  Our theory, in a combined process-algebraic and reactive-synthesis style,
provides the operations of parallel composition for system integration, logical
conjunction/disjunction for viewpoint fusion and independent development, and
quotient for incremental synthesis.
  We show that a substitutive refinement preorder, which is a coarsening of the
pre-congruence in [10], constitutes the weakest pre-congruence preserving
freedom of incompatibility errors. The coarsening requires a shift in the focus
of our theory to a more game-theoretical treatment, where the coarsening
constitutes a reactive synthesis game named normalisation and is efficiently
implementable by a novel local bot-backpropagation algorithm.
  Previously, timed concurrent games have been studied in [1,14,13], where one
of the key concern is the removal of time-blocking strategies by applying blame
assignment [13]. Our timed games also have the issue of time-blocking
strategies, which may arise through the composition of specifications. However,
due to our distinctively different formulation of timed games, we have
discovered another elegant solution to the problem without blame assignment.
Our solution utilises a second reactive synthesis game called realisation,
which is dual to normalisation and implementable by the dual local
top-backpropagation algorithm.

link between these disparate structures has not been established. We address
this issue by using dynamic emission in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) to probe
the connections of these structures. The SDO/AIA observations show that the
cavity exhibits excessive emission variability compared to the surrounding
quiet-sun streamer, particularly in the 171\AA bandpass. We find that this
dynamic emission takes the form of coherent loop-like brightening structures
which emanate from the prominence into the central cavity. The geometry of
these structures, dubbed prominence horns, generally mimics the curvature of
the cavity boundary. We use a space-time statistical analysis of two cavities
in multiple AIA bandpasses to constrain the energetic properties of 45 horns.
In general, we find there is a positive correlation between the light curves of
the horns in the 171\AA and 193\AA bandpasses, however the 193\AA emission is a
factor of 5 weaker. There is also a strong correlation between structural
changes to the prominence as viewed in the He II 304\AA bandpass and the
enhanced 171\AA emission. In that bandpass, the prominence appears to extend
several megameters along the 171\AA horn where we observe co-spatial,
co-temporal 304\AA and 171\AA emission dynamics. We present these observations
as evidence of the magnetic and energetic connection between the prominence and
the cavity. Further modeling work is necessary to explain the physical source
and consequences of these events, particularly in the context of the
traditional paradigm: the cavity is under dense because it supplies mass to the
over dense prominence.

principles within the density functional theory. It is revealed that the
quasi-two-dimensional ferroelectricity occurs in these SLs in the barium
titanate layers with a thickness of one unit cell; the polarization is oriented
in the layer plane and weakly interacts with the polarization in neighboring
layers. The ferroelectric ordering energy and the height of the barrier
separating different orientational states of polarization in these SLs are
sufficiently large to provide the formation of an array of independent
polarized planes at 300 K. The effect of the structural instability on the
properties of SLs is considered. It is shown that the ground state is a result
of simultaneous condensation of the $\Gamma_{15}$ polar phonon and phonons at
the $M$ point (for SLs with even period) or at the $A$ point (for SLs with odd
period); it is a polar structure with out-of-phase rotations of the octahedra
in neighboring layers, in which highly polarized layers are spatially separated
from the layers with strong rotations. The competition between the
ferroelectric and structural instabilities in biaxially compressed SLs
manifests itself in that the switching on of the octahedra rotations leads to
an abrupt change of the polarization direction and can cause an improper
ferroelectric phase transition to occur. It was shown that the experimentally
observed $z$-component of polarization in the SLs can appear only as a result
of the mechanical stress relaxation.

followed up to few seconds before the explosive breakout in the framework of

  We find that the evolutionary properties depend only on the actual mass of

frequency and amplitude of the gravitational wave emission, which occurs during
the mass transfer process and acts as a self-tuning mechanism of the accretion
process itself. The gravitational signal related to Galactic sources can be
easily detected with the next generation of space-born interferometers and can
provide notable constraints to the progenitor model. The expected statistical
distribution of pre-explosive objects in the Galaxy is provided also in the
effective temperature-apparent bolometric magnitude diagrams which can be used
to identify merged DD systems via UV surveys.
  We emphasize that the thermonuclear explosion occurs owing to the decay of
physical conditions keeping over-stable the structure above the classical
Chandrasekhar limit and not by a steady increase of the WD mass up to this
limit. This conclusion is independent of the evolutionary scenario for the
progenitors, but it is a direct consequence of the stabilizing effect of
rotation. Such an occurrence is epistemological change of the perspective in
defining the ignition process in accreting WDs. Moreover, this requires a long
evolutionary period (several million years) to attain the explosion after the
above mentioned conditions cease to keep stable the WD. Therefore it is
practically impossible to detect the trace of the exploding WD companion in
recent pre-explosion frames of even very near SN Ia.

field can form nontrivial band topologies characterized by nonzero integer band
Chern numbers. In this Letter, we investigate such a lattice model originating
from the Hofstadter model and demonstrate that the band topology transitions
can be realized by simply introducing tunable longer-range hopping. The rich
phase diagram of band Chern numbers is obtained for the simple rational flux
density and a classification of phases is presented. In the presence of
interactions, the existence of fractional quantum Hall states in both |C|=1 and
|C|>1 bands is confirmed, which can reflect the band topologies in different
phases. In contrast, when our model reduces to a one-dimensional lattice, the
ground states are crucially different from fractional quantum Hall states. Our
results may provide insights into the study of new fractional quantum Hall
states and experimental realizations of various topological phases in optical
lattices.

decades. Due to their NP-hardness, methods to solve the optimization problem
have changed from traditional mathematical programming to modern intelligent
optimization techniques. In this study, with respect to the model formulation,
we have demonstrated that the network system can be reduced to the
dimensionality of the number of closed simple loops or required independent
paths, and the reduced nonlinear system can be solved efficiently by the
Newton-Raphson method. Regarding the optimization technique, a discrete state
transition algorithm (STA) is introduced to solve several cases of water
distribution networks. In discrete STA, there exist four basic intelligent
operators, namely, swap, shift, symmetry and substitute as well as the ""risk
and restore in probability"" strategy. Firstly, we focus on a parametric study
of the restore probability $p_1$ and risk probability $p_2$. To effectively
deal with the head pressure constraints, we then investigate the effect of
penalty coefficient and search enforcement on the performance of the algorithm.
Based on the experience gained from the training of the Two-Loop network
problem, the discrete STA has successfully achieved the best known solutions
for the Hanoi and New York problems. A detailed comparison of our results with
those gained by other algorithms is also presented.

involves an irreducible Planck-scale contribution to the uncertainty of the

phenomenological programme looking for blurring of images of distant
astrophysical sources that would result from such energy uncertainties. We here
report the first ever physical characterization of spacetime fuzziness derived
constructively within a quantum picture of spacetime, the one provided by
spacetime noncommutativity. Our results confirm earlier heuristic arguments
suggesting that spacetime fuzziness, while irrelevantly small on terrestrial
scales, could be observably large for propagation of particles over

$m$ fluxons, $n_\phi^{(m)}$, is connected with the electron density $n_{\mathrm

for higher $m$, generating correct values $me^2/h$ for the Hall conductivity
$\sigma_{\mathrm H}\equiv j/E_{\mathrm H}$. For condensed c-bosons the density
of c-bosons-with-$m$ fluxons, $n_\phi^{(m)}$, is connected with the boson

and would therefore provide a hint towards a glueball. In this talk we
summarize some arguments in favour and against the existence of f_0(1370) and
discuss schemes with and without this state included.

21P/Giacobini-Zinner during its XIX and XX century perihelion approaches with
the comet being close to perihelion. The geometric circumstances of that
encounter were thus favorable to produce a meteor storm, but the trails were
much older than in the 1933 and 1946 historical encounters. As a consequence
the 2011 October Draconid display exhibited several activity peaks with
Zenithal Hourly Rates of about 400 meteors per hour. In fact, if the display
had been not forecasted, it could have passed almost unnoticed as was strongly
attenuated for visual observers due to the Moon. This suggests that most meteor
storms of a similar nature could have passed historically unnoticed under
unfavorable weather and Moon observing conditions. The possibility of obtaining
information on the physical properties of cometary meteoroids penetrating the
atmosphere under low-geocentric velocity encounter circumstances motivated us
to set up a special observing campaign. Added to the Spanish Fireball Network
wide-field all-sky and CCD video monitoring, other high-sensitivity 1/2"" black
and white CCD video cameras were attached to modified medium-field lenses for
obtaining high resolution orbital information. The trajectory, radiant, and
orbital data of 16 October Draconid meteors observed at multiple stations are
presented. The results show that the meteors appeared from a geocentric radiant
located at R.A.=263.0+-0.4 deg. and Dec.=+55.3+-0.3 deg. that is in close
agreement with the radiant predicted for the 1873-1894 and the 1900 dust
trails. The estimated mass of material from 21P/Giacobini-Zinner delivered to
Earth during the six-hours outburst was around 950+-150 kg.

show that the rotation-age relationship can be well reproduced using a

Accepted by MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stt750",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present an adaptation of the ATPM to simultaneously predict the Yarkovsky
and YORP effects in the presence of global self-heating that occurs within the
large concavities of irregularly shaped asteroids, which has been neglected or
dismissed in all previous models. It is also combined with rough surface
thermal-infrared beaming effects, which have been previously shown to enhance
the Yarkovsky-orbital-drift and dampen on average the
YORP-rotational-acceleration by orders of several tens of per cent. Tests on
all published concave shape models of near-Earth asteroids, and also on one
hundred Gaussian-random-spheres, show that the Yarkovsky effect is sensitive to
shadowing and global self-heating effects at the few per cent level or less.
For simplicity, Yarkovsky models can neglect these effects if the level of
accuracy desired is of this order. Unlike the Yarkovsky effect, the YORP effect
can be very sensitive to shadowing and global self-heating effects. Its
sensitivity increases with decreasing relative strength of the
YORP-rotational-acceleration, and doesn't appear to depend greatly on the
degree of asteroid concavity. Global self-heating tends to produce a vertical
offset in an asteroid's YORP-rotational-acceleration versus obliquity curve
which is in opposite direction to that produced by shadowing effects. It also
ensures that at least one critical obliquity angle exists at which zero
YORP-rotational-acceleration occurs. Global self-heating must be included for
accurate predictions of the YORP effect if an asteroid exhibits a large
shadowing effect. If global self-heating effects are not included then it is
found in ~75 per cent of cases that better predictions are produced when
shadowing is also not included. Furthermore, global self-heating has
implications for reducing the sensitivity of the YORP effect predictions to
detailed variations in an asteroid's shape model.

physics for the evolution of low-mass stars. We analyse the dependence of the
cumulative physical uncertainty affecting stellar tracks on the chemical
composition. We calculated more than 6000 stellar tracks and isochrones, with
metallicity ranging from Z = 0.0001 to 0.02, by changing the following physical
inputs within their current range of uncertainty: 1H(p,nu e+)2H,
14N(p,gamma)15O and triple-alpha reaction rates, radiative and conductive
opacities, neutrino energy losses, and microscopic diffusion velocities. The
analysis was performed using a latin hypercube sampling design. We examine in a
statistical way the dependence on the variation of the physical inputs of the
turn-off (TO) luminosity, the central hydrogen exhaustion time (t_H), the
luminosity and the helium core mass at the red-giant branch (RGB) tip, and the
zero age horizontal branch (ZAHB) luminosity in the RR Lyrae region. For the
stellar tracks, an increase from Z = 0.0001 to Z = 0.02 produces a cumulative
physical uncertainty in TO luminosity from 0.028 dex to 0.017 dex, while the
global uncertainty on t_H increases from 0.42 Gyr to 1.08 Gyr. For the RGB tip,
the cumulative uncertainty on the luminosity is almost constant at 0.03 dex,
whereas the one the helium core mass decreases from 0.0055 M_sun to 0.0035
M_sun. The dependence of the ZAHB luminosity error is not monotonic with Z, and
it varies from a minimum of 0.036 dex at Z = 0.0005 to a maximum of 0.047 dex
at Z = 0.0001. Regarding stellar isochrones of 12 Gyr, the cumulative physical
uncertainty on the predicted TO luminosity and mass increases respectively from
0.012 dex to 0.014 dex and from 0.0136 M_sun to 0.0186 M_sun. Consequently, for
ages typical of galactic globular clusters, the uncertainty on the age inferred
from the TO luminosity increases from 325 Myr to 415 Myr.

we predict the intra-chip saturation characteristics and the optimal operating
point in terms of energy to solution as a function of implementation details,
clock frequency, vectorization, and number of active cores per chip. We show
that high single-core performance and a correct choice of the number of active
cores per chip are the essential optimizations for lowest energy to solution at
minimal performance degradation. Then we extrapolate to the MPI-parallel level
and quantify the energy-saving potential of various optimizations and execution
modes, where we find these guidelines to be even more important, especially
when communication overhead is non-negligible. In our setup we could achieve
energy savings of 35% in this case, compared to a naive approach. We also
demonstrate that a simple non-reflective reduction of the clock speed leaves
most of the energy saving potential unused.

  matters","10 pages, 4 figures",,"10.1093/mnras/stt705",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Observations indicate that the central portions of the Present-Day Prestellar
Core Mass Function (CMF) and the Stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF) both have
approximately log-normal shapes, but that the CMF is displaced to higher mass
than the IMF by a factor F = 4+/-1. This has lead to suggestions that the shape
of the IMF is directly inherited from the shape of the CMF - and therefore, by
implication, that there is a self-similar mapping from the CMF onto the IMF. If
we assume a self-similar mapping, it follows (i) that F = N0/eta, where eta is
the mean fraction of a core's mass that ends up in stars, and N0 is the mean
number of stars spawned by a single core; and (ii) that the stars spawned by a
single core must have an approximately log-normal distribution of relative
masses, with universal standard deviation sigma0. Observations can be expected
to deliver ever more accurate estimates of F, but this still leaves a
degeneracy between eta and N0; and sigma0 is also unconstrained by observation.
Here we show that these parameters can be estimated by invoking binary
statistics. Specifically, if (a) each core spawns one long-lived binary system,
and (b) the probability that a star of mass M is part of this long-lived binary
is proportional to M^alpha, current observations of the binary frequency as a
function of primary mass and the distribution of mass ratios strongly favour
eta = 1.0 +/- 0.3, N0 = 4.3 +/- 0.4, sigma0 = 0.3 +/- 0.03 and alpha = 0.9 +/-
0.6. The mapping from CMF to IMF is not necessarily self-similar - there are
many possible motivations for a non self-similar mapping - but if it is not,
then the shape of the IMF cannot be inherited from the CMF. Given the limited
observational constraints currently available and the ability of a self-similar
mapping to satisfy them, the possibility that the shape of the IMF is inherited
from the CMF cannot be ruled out at this juncture.

an exact superconductor-magnetism duality of the Hamiltonian. We employ
numerical calculations as well as analytical arguments to identify the domain

junctions, and elucidate the characteristic differences with the corresponding

also estimate the magnitude of the magneto-Josephson effects in realistic

sex, are predicted to evolve at different rates than those on autosomes. This
faster-X effect can arise either as a consequence of hemizygosity, which leads
to more efficient selection for recessive beneficial mutations in the
heterogametic sex, or as a consequence of reduced effective population size of
the hemizygous chromosome, which leads to increased fixation of weakly
deleterious mutations due to random genetic drift. Empirical results to date
have suggested that, while the overall pattern across taxa is complicated, in
general systems with male-heterogamy show a faster-X effect primarily
attributable to more efficient selection while the only female-heterogamy taxon
studied to date (birds) shows a faster-Z effect primarily attributable to
increased drift. In order to test the generality of the faster-Z pattern seen
in birds, we sequenced the genome of the Lepidopteran insect Bombyx huttoni, a
close outgroup of the domesticated silkmoth Bombyx mori. We show that silkmoths
experience faster-Z evolution, but unlike in birds, the faster-Z effect appears
to be attributable to more efficient positive selection in females. These
results suggest that female-heterogamy alone is unlikely to be sufficient to
explain the reduced efficacy of selection on the bird Z chromosome. Instead, it
is likely that a combination of patterns of dosage compensation and overall
effective population size, among other factors, influence patterns of faster-Z
evolution.

walls significantly affect the average swimming speed and power consumption of
the model microorganism. In the case of swimming parallel to the tube axis, the
locomotion speed is always reduced (resp. increased) for swimmers with
tangential (resp. normal) deformation. In all cases, the rate of work nec-

in the far field generally follow helical trajectories, solely induced by
hydrodynamic interactions with the tube walls, and in qualitative agreement
with recent experimental observations for Paramecium. Swimmers of the puller

swim in the centre of the tube while those with strong dipoles (large {\alpha})

production of goldstinos from scatterings with the supersymmetric Standard

from the zero temperature minimum and under certain conditions it dominates the
energy density of the universe producing late entropy. We show that it is
possible to have high enough reheating temperatures that thermal leptogenesis
and thermal vacuum selection can be realized without gravitino overproduction.

the former case the messenger scale has to be less than about $10^6$ GeV with
the gravitino relatively heavy, $m_{3/2}\geq {\cal O}(10)$ GeV. In the later

resonances arise through the dependence of the hyperfine coupling on
internuclear distance. We survey the Feshbach resonances in diatomic systems
combining the nine stable alkali-metal isotopes with those of Yb, focussing on
the illustrative examples of RbYb and CsYb. We show that the resonance widths
may expressed as a product of physically comprehensible terms in the framework
of Fermi's Golden Rule. The resonance widths depend strongly on the background

the hyperfine coupling constant and the magnetic field. In favorable cases the

hierarchically clustered associations, most of which disperse into their
galactic field once feedback destroys their parent clouds. However, during
their early evolution in these substructured environments, stars can undergo
close encounters with one another that might have significant impacts on their
protoplanetary disks or young planetary systems. We perform N-body simulations
of the early evolution of dissolving, substructured clusters with a wide range
of properties, with the aim of quantifying the expected number and orbital
element distributions of encounters as a function of cluster properties. We
show that the presence of substructure both boosts the encounter rate and
modifies the distribution of encounter velocities compared to what would be
expected for a dynamically relaxed cluster. However, the boost only lasts for a
dynamical time, and as a result the overall number of encounters expected
remains low enough that gravitational stripping is unlikely to be a significant
effect for the vast majority of star-forming environments in the Galaxy. We
briefly discuss the implications of this result for models of the origin of the
Solar System, and of free-floating planets. We also provide tabulated encounter
rates and orbital element distributions suitable for inclusion in population
synthesis models of planet formation in a clustered environment.

presence of non-perturbative quantum gravitational modifications. A comparative
analysis with the classical theory by including more general initial conditions
than the ones previously considered in the latter is also performed. We show
that, in general, the classical singularity is replaced by a bounce of the mean
scale factor in loop quantum cosmology. Due to the underlying quantum geometric
effects, the energy density of the inflaton and the anisotropic shear remain
bounded throughout the non-singular evolution. Starting from arbitrary
anisotropic initial conditions, a loop quantum universe isotropizes either
before or soon after the onset of slow-roll inflation. We find a double
attractor behavior in the phase space dynamics of loop quantum cosmology,
similar to the one in classical theory, but with some additional subtle
features. Quantum modifications to the dynamical equations are such that,
unlike the classical theory, the amount of inflation does not monotonically
depend on the initial anisotropy in loop quantum cosmology. Our results suggest
that a viable non-singular inflationary model can be constructed from highly
anisotropic initial conditions in the Planck regime.

directly probe the inner regions of the accretion disk. We present the results
of our analysis of average AGN XMM-Newton X-ray spectra in the Chandra Deep
Field South observation (XMM CDFS). We computed the average spectrum of a
sample of 54 AGN with spectroscopic redshifts and signal-to-noise ratio S/N >
15 in the 2-12 keV rest-frame band in at least one EPIC camera. We have taken
the effects of combining spectra from sources at different redshifts and both
EPIC cameras into account, as well as their spectral resolution; we checked our
results using thorough simulations. We explored the Fe line components of
distant AGN focusing on the narrow core which arises from regions far from the
central engine and on the putative relativistic component (from the accretion
disk). The average spectrum shows a highly significant Fe feature. Our
model-independent estimates of the equivalent width (EW) suggest a higher EW in
a broader range. The line, modelled as an unresolved Gaussian, is significant
at 6.8 sigma and has an EW=95 eV (full sample). The current data can be fitted
equally well adding a relativistic profile to the narrow component (in the full
sample, EW=140 eV and 67 eV respectively for the relativistic and narrow
lines). Thanks to the high quality of the XMM CDFS spectra and to the detailed
modelling of the continuum and instrumental effects, we have shown that the
most distant AGN exhibit a highly significant Fe emission feature. It can be
modelled both with narrow and broad lines. We found tantalising evidence for
reflection by material both very close and far away from the central engine.
The EW of both features are similar to those observed in individual nearby AGN,
hence they must be a widespread characteristic of AGN, since otherwise the
average values would be smaller than observed.

geometric domain by mobile robots. Consider a line segment $[0,I]$ and a set of
$n$ mobile robots $r_1,r_2,..., r_n$ placed at one of its endpoints. Each robot
has a {\em searching speed} $s_i$ and a {\em walking speed} $w_i$, where $s_i
<w_i$. We assume that each robot is aware of the number of robots of the
collection and their corresponding speeds. At each time moment a robot $r_i$
either walks along a portion of the segment not exceeding its walking speed
$w_i$ or searches a portion of the segment with the speed not exceeding $s_i$.
A search of segment $[0,I]$ is completed at the time when each of its points
have been searched by at least one of the $n$ robots. We want to develop {\em
mobility schedules} (algorithms) for the robots which complete the search of
the segment as fast as possible. More exactly we want to maximize the {\em
speed} of the mobility schedule (equal to the ratio of the segment length
versus the time of the completion of the schedule).
  We analyze first the offline scenario when the robots know the length of the
segment that is to be searched. We give an algorithm producing a mobility
schedule for arbitrary walking and searching speeds and prove its optimality.
Then we propose an online algorithm, when the robots do not know in advance the
actual length of the segment to be searched. The speed $S$ of such algorithm is
defined as $S = \inf_{I_L} S(I_L)$ where $S(I_L)$ denotes the speed of
searching of segment $I_L=[0,L]$. We prove that the proposed online algorithm
is 2-competitive. The competitive ratio is shown to be better in the case when
the robots' walking speeds are all the same.

primal-dual splitting method in the context of solving portfolio optimization
problems which assume the minimization of risk measures associated to different
convex utility functions. We show that, due to the splitting characteristic of
the used primal-dual method, the main effort in implementing it constitutes in
the calculation of the proximal points of the utility functions, which assume
explicit expressions in a number of cases. When quantifying risk via the
meanwhile classical Conditional Value-at-Risk, an alternative approach relying
on the use of its dual representation is presented as well. The theoretical
results are finally illustrated via some numerical experiments on real and
synthetic data sets.

The asymmetry of time also has different meanings that depend on

expansion of the universe. These and related issues are discussed in both
classical and quantum mechanical contexts.

center of the vortex. As an experimental consequence, the EMCD signal will only

  precursor to the deep solar minimum in the cycle 23?","25 pages, 8 Fiures, Accepted for publication in Solar Physics Journal",,"10.1007/s11207-013-0335-3",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Using both wavelet and Fourier analysis, a study has been undertaken of the
changes in the quasi-periodic variations in solar photospheric fields in the
build-up to one of the deepest solar minima experienced in the past 100 years.
This unusual and deep solar minimum occurred between solar cycles 23 and 24.
The study, carried out using ground based synoptic magnetograms spanning the
period 1975.14 to 2009.86, covered solar cycles 21, 22 and 23. A hemispheric
asymmetry in periodicities of the photospheric fields was seen only at
latitudes above $\pm45{^{\circ}}$ when the data was divided, based on a wavelet
analysis, into two parts: one prior to 1996 and the other after 1996.
Furthermore, the hemispheric asymmetry was observed to be confined to the
latitude range 45${^{\circ}}$ to 60${^{\circ}}$. This can be attributed to the
variations in polar surges that primarily depend on both the emergence of
surface magnetic flux and varying solar surface flows. The observed asymmetry
when coupled with the fact that both solar fields above $\pm45{^{\circ}}$ and
micro-turbulence levels in the inner-heliosphere have been decreasing since the
early to mid nineties (Janardhan et al., 2011) suggests that around this time
active changes occurred in the solar dynamo that governs the underlying basic
processes in the sun. These changes in turn probably initiated the build-up to
the very deep solar minimum at the end of the cycle 23. The decline in fields
above $\pm45{^{\circ}}$ for well over a solar cycle, would imply that weak
polar fields have been generated in the past two successive solar cycles
\textit{viz.} cycles 22 and 23. A continuation of this declining trend beyond
22 years, if it occurs, will have serious implications on our current
understanding of the solar dynamo.

11158, which produced one X-class and several M-class flares on 2011 February
13$-$16. We focus on the magnetic twist in four flare events, M6.6, X2.2, M1.0,
and M1.1. The magnetic twist is estimated from the nonlinear force-free field
extrapolated from the vector fields obtained from the Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager on board the Solar Dynamic Observatory using magnetohydrodynamic
relaxation method developed by \cite{2011ApJ...738..161I}. We found that
strongly twisted lines ranging from half-turn to one-turn twist were built up
just before the M6.6- and X2.2 flares and disappeared after that. Because most
of the twist remaining after these flares was less than half-turn twist, this
result suggests that the buildup of magnetic twist over the half-turn twist is
a key process in the production of large flares. On the other hand, even though
these strong twists were also built up just before the M1.0 and M1.1 flares,
most of them remained afterwords. Careful topological analysis before the M1.0
and M1.1 flares shows that the strongly twisted lines were surrounded mostly by
the weakly twisted lines formed in accordance with the clockwise motion of the
positive sunspot, whose footpoints are rooted in strong magnetic flux regions.
These results imply that these weakly twisted lines might suppress the activity
of the strongly twisted lines in the last two M-class flares.

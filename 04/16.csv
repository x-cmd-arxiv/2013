orientation and navigation. Intensive studies particularly behavior experiments
with birds, provide support for a chemical compass based on magnetically
sensitive free radical reactions as a source of this sense. However, the
fundamental question of how quantum coherence plays an essential role in such a
chemical compass model of avian magnetoreception yet remains controversial.
Here, we show that the essence of the chemical compass model can be understood
in analogy to a quantum interferometer exploiting global quantum coherence
rather than any subsystem coherence. Within the framework of quantum metrology,
we quantify global quantum coherence and correlate it with the function of
chemical magnetoreception. Our results allow us to understand and predict how
various factors can affect the performance of a chemical compass from the
unique perspective of quantum coherence assisted metrology. This represents a
crucial step to affirm a direct connection between quantum coherence and the
function of a chemical compass.

showed decreased and chaotic spot activity, with no signs of the drift pattern.
Here we set out to investigate from a more extensive photometric dataset
whether such a drift is a persistent phenomenon, in which case it could be due
to either an azimuthal dynamo wave or an indication of the binary system
orbital synchronization still being incomplete. We analyse the datasets using
the Carrier Fit method (hereafter CF), especially suitable for analyzing time
series in which a fast clocking frequency (such as the rotation of the star) is
modulated with a slower process (such as the stellar activity cycle). We
combine all collected photometric data into one single data set, and analyze it
with the CF method. As a result, we confirm the earlier results of the spot
activity having been dominated by one primary spotted region almost through the
entire data set, and the existence of a persistent, nearly linear drift.
Disruptions of the linear trend and complicated phase behavior are also seen,
but the period analysis reveals a rather stable periodicity with
P(spot)=6.71054d plus/minus 0.00005d. After the linear trend is removed from
the data, we identify several abrupt phase jumps, three of which are analyzed
in more detail with the CF method. These phase jumps closely resemble what is
called flip-flop event, but the new spot configurations do not, in most cases,
persist for longer than a few months.

rational relations on words. The primary motivation comes from the study of
logics for querying graph topology, which have recently found numerous
applications. Such logics use conditions on paths expressed by regular
languages and relations, but they often need to be extended by rational
relations such as subword or subsequence. Evaluating formulae in such extended
graph logics boils down to checking nonemptiness of the intersection of
rational relations with regular or recognizable relations (or, more generally,
to the generalized intersection problem, asking whether some projections of a
regular relation have a nonempty intersection with a given rational relation).
  We prove that for several basic and commonly used rational relations, the
intersection problem with regular relations is either undecidable (e.g., for
subword or suffix, and some generalizations), or decidable with
non-primitive-recursive complexity (e.g., for subsequence and its
generalizations). These results are used to rule out many classes of graph
logics that freely combine regular and rational relations, as well as to
provide the simplest problem related to verifying lossy channel systems that
has non-primitive-recursive complexity. We then prove a dichotomy result for
logics combining regular conditions on individual paths and rational relations
on paths, by showing that the syntactic form of formulae classifies them into
either efficiently checkable or undecidable cases. We also give examples of
rational relations for which such logics are decidable even without syntactic
restrictions.

characterize the optimal protection problem, which protects the state variables

obtaining the potential. Access to the full spectrum allows an investigation of
spectral features that do not contribute to the potential but can pose a
challenge to numerical attempts of an analytic continuation from imaginary time
data. Differences in these contributions between the Wilson loop and gauge
fixed Wilson line correlators are discussed. To better understand the

In this letter, we want to challenge this assumption. To this aim, we have
considered molecular dynamics simulations of the crystallization in a
suspension of Yukawa-type colloids. In order to investigate the role of
hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) mediated by the solvent, we modeled the solvent
both implicitly and explicitly, using Langevin dynamics and the fluctuating
Lattice Boltzmann method, respectively. Our simulations show a dramatic
reduction of the crystal growth velocity due to HIs even at moderate
hydrodynamic coupling. A detailed analysis shows that this slowdown is due to
the wall-like properties of the crystal surface, which reduces the colloidal
diffusion towards the crystal surface by hydrodynamic screening.
Crystallization in suspensions therefore differs strongly from pure melts,
making them less useful as a toy model than previously thought.

the Sun have been observed by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI) on either
of the twin STEREO spacecraft. Our objective is to estimate their X-ray peak
fluxes from EUVI data by finding a relation of the EUVI with GOES X-ray fluxes.
Because of the presence of the Fe xxiv line at 192 A, the response of the EUVI
195 A channel has a secondary broad peak around 15 MK, and its fluxes closely
trace X-ray fluxes during the rise phase of flares. If the flare plasma is
isothermal, the EUVI flux should be directly proportional to the GOES flux. In
reality, the multithermal nature of the flare and other factors complicate the
estimation of the X-ray fluxes from EUVI observations. We discuss the uncer-
tainties, by comparing GOES fluxes with the high cadence EUV data from the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO). We conclude that the EUVI 195 A data can provide estimates of the X-ray
peak fluxes of intense flares (e.g., above M4 in the GOES scale) with
uncertainties of a factor of a few. Lastly we show examples of intense flares
from regions far behind the limb, some of which show eruptive signatures in AIA
images.

introduced by de Broglie in terms of intrinsically ""periodic phenomena"".
However, after nearly 90 years, the physical origin of such undulatory
mechanics remains unrevealed. We propose a natural realization of the de
Broglie ""periodic phenomenon"" in terms of harmonic vibrational modes associated
to space-time periodicities. In this way we find that, similarly to a vibrating
string or a particle in a box, the intrinsic recurrence imposed as a constraint
to elementary particles represents a fully consistent quantization condition.
The resulting classical cyclic dynamics formally match ordinary relativistic
Quantum Mechanics in both the canonical and Feynman formulations. Interactions
are introduced in a geometrodynamical way, similarly to general relativity, by
simply considering that variations of kinematical state can be equivalently
described in terms of modulations of space-time recurrences, as known from
undulatory mechanics. We present this novel quantization prescription from a
historical prospective.

observation of a C4.1 flare taken with IBIS on 2011 October 22. The flare
consists of a main circular ribbon that occurred in a parasitic magnetic

circular-ribbon flare with a remote brightening is predicted in 3D fan-spine
reconnection but so far has been rarely observed. During the flare impulsive
phase, we define ""core"" and ""halo"" structures in the observed ribbon. Examining
the \ha\ emission spectra averaged in the flare core and halo areas, we find
that only those from the flare cores show typical nonthermal electron beam
heating characteristics. These characteristics include: broad and centrally
reversed emission spectra, excess emission in the red wing with regard to the
blue wing (i.e., red asymmetry), and redshifted bisectors of the emission
spectra. We also observe rather quick timescales for the heating (30 s) and
cooling (14--33 s) in the flare core locations. Therefore, we suggest that the
flare cores revealed by IBIS track the sites of electron beam precipitation
with exceptional spatial and temporal resolution. The flare cores show
two-stage motion (a parallel motion along the ribbon followed by an expansion
motion perpendicular to the ribbon) during the two impulsive phases of the
flare. Some cores jump quickly (30 \kms) between discrete magnetic elements
implying reconnection involving different flux tubes. We observe a very high
temporal correlation ($\gtrsim0.9$) between the integrated \ha\ and HXR
emission during the flare impulsive phase. A short time delay (4.6 s) is also
found in the \ha\ emission spikes relative to HXR bursts. The ionization
timescale of the cool chromosphere and the extra time taken for the electrons
to travel to the remote ribbon site may contribute to this delay.

stellar-mass black holes and supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Simulations have
shown that IMBHs may form in dense star clusters, and therefore may still be
present in these smaller stellar systems. We investigate the Galactic globular
cluster NGC 5286 for indications of a central IMBH using spectroscopic data
from VLT/FLAMES, velocity measurements from the Rutgers Fabry Perot at CTIO,
and photometric data from HST. We run analytic spherical and axisymmetric Jeans
models with different central black-hole masses, anisotropy, mass-to-light
ratio, and inclination. Further, we compare the data to a grid of N-body
simulations without tidal field. Additionally, we use one N-body simulation to
check the results of the spherical Jeans models for the total cluster mass.
Both the Jeans models and the N-body simulations favor the presence of a
central black hole in NGC 5286 and our detection is at the 1- to 1.5-sigma
level. From the spherical Jeans models we obtain a best fit with black-hole
mass M_BH=(1.5+-1.0)x10^3 M_sun. The error is the 68% confidence limit from
Monte Carlo simulations. Axisymmetric models give a consistent result. The best
fitting N-body model is found with a black hole of 0.9% of the total cluster
mass (4.38+-0.18)x10^5 M_sun, which results in an IMBH mass of
M_BH=(3.9+-2.0)x10^3 M_sun. Jeans models give lower values for the total
cluster mass. Our test of the Jeans models with N-body simulation data shows
that this discrepancy has two reasons: The influence of a radially varying M/L
profile, and underestimation of the velocity dispersion as the measurements are
limited to bright stars. We conclude that detection of IMBHs in Galactic
globular clusters remains a challenging task unless their mass fractions are
above those found for SMBHs in nearby galaxies. [abridged]

Prefetching is one such technique that utilizes prefetching rules derived
through Cyclic Model Analysis of the mined Web sequential patterns. The more
accurate the prediction and more satisfying the results of prefetching if we
use a highly efficient and scalable mining technique such as the Bidirectional
Growth based Directed Acyclic Graph. In this paper, we propose a novel
algorithm called Bidirectional Growth based mining Cyclic behavior Analysis of
web sequential Patterns (BGCAP) that effectively combines these strategies to
generate prefetching rules in the form of 2-sequence patterns with Periodicity
and threshold of Cyclic Behaviour that can be utilized to effectively prefetch
Web pages, thus reducing the users perceived latency. As BGCAP is based on
Bidirectional pattern growth, it performs only (log n+1) levels of recursion
for mining n Web sequential patterns. Our experimental results show that
prefetching rules generated using BGCAP is 5-10 percent faster for different
data sizes and 10-15% faster for a fixed data size than TD-Mine. In addition,
BGCAP generates about 5-15 percent more prefetching rules than TD-Mine.

show how to use this algorithm for encoding-decoding multichannel sources. This

membrane diffusion studies [Kusumi et al., Biophysical J., 1993] appealed to
Mean Square Displacement tools for extracting diffusivity and other parameters
quantifying the degree of confinement. More recently, the practical utility of
systematically treating multiple noise sources (including noise induced by
random photon counts) through likelihood techniques have been more broadly
realized in the SPT community. However, bias induced by finite time series
sample sizes has not received great attention. Mitigating parameter bias
induced by finite sampling is important to any scientific endeavor aiming for
high accuracy, but correcting for bias is also often an important step in the
construction of optimal parameter estimates. In this article, it is
demonstrated how a popular model of confinement can be corrected for finite
sample bias in situations where the underlying data exhibits Brownian diffusion
and observations are measured with non-negligible experimental noise (e.g.,
noise induced by finite photon counts). The work of Tang and Chen [J.
Econometrics, 2009] is extended to correct for bias in the estimated corral
radius (a parameter commonly used to quantify confinement in SPT studies) in
the presence of measurement noise. It is shown that the approach presented is
capable of reliably extracting the corral radius using only hundreds of
discretely sampled observations in situations where other methods (including
MSD and Bayesian techniques) would encounter serious difficulties. The ability
to accurately statistically characterize transient confinement suggests new
techniques for quantifying confined and/or hop diffusion in complex

negative consequences: pain, harm, loss or failure. The AI signals about bad
low aversive qualities, which make us sick or cause discomfort. These cortical
inputs activate directly and indirectly (via D2 loop of VS) the LHb, which
inhibits dopamine and serotonin release (and is reciprocally inhibited by VTA,
DRN) to avoid choosing and doing things leading to harm or loss, but also to

attenuates the output of the adversity processing circuit, thus decreasing
inhibitory avoidance and self-control, while serotonin attenuates dACC, AI,
clOFC, D1 loop of VS, LHb, amygdala and pain pathway. Thus, by reciprocal
inhibition, by causing dopamine and serotonin suppression - and by being
suppressed by them, the adversity processing circuit competes with reward
processing circuit for control of choice behaviour and affective states. We
propose stimulating effect of dopamine and calming inhibitory effect of
serotonin on the active avoidance circuit involving amygdala, linked to threat
processing, anger, fear, self-defense and violences. We describe causes and
roles of dopamine and serotonin signaling, and mental dysfunctions. We add new

the surface magnetic field as of the order of $10^{14}\,{\rm G}$. On the other
hand, the temperature of the hot spots is about a few million Kelvins. Based on
these two facts the Partially Screened Gap (PSG) model was proposed to describe
the Inner Acceleration Region (IAR). The PSG model assumes that the temperature
of the actual polar cap is equal to the so-called critical value, i.e. the
temperature at which the outflow of thermal ions from the surface screens the
gap completely.
  We have found that, depending on the conditions above the polar cap, the
generation of high energetic photons in IAR can be caused either by Curvature
Radiation (CR) or by Inverse Compton Scattering (ICS). This results in two
different scenarios of breaking the acceleration gap: the so-called PSG-off
mode for CR-dominated gaps and the PSG-on mode ICS-dominated gaps. The
existence of two different mechanisms of gap breakdown naturally explains the
mode-changing and the pulse nulling. Furthermore, the mode changes of the IAR
may explain the anti-correlation of radio and X-ray emission in very recent
observations of PSR B0943+10 (Hermsen et al., 2013).
  Simultaneous analysis of X-ray and radio properties have allowed to develop a
model which explains the drifting subpulse phenomenon. According to this model
the drift takes place when the charge density in IAR differs from the
Goldreich-Julian co-rotational density. The proposed model allows to verify
both the radio drift parameters and X-ray efficiency of the observed pulsars.

The radii of the particles extend up to 20 cm, and perhaps up to 2 m, but their

two cases: bright icy material, and dark dusty material. The icy case better
describes the particles if water sublimation from the particles causes a
significant rocket force, which we propose as the best method to account for
the observed spatial distribution. Solar radiation is a plausible alternative,
but only if the particles are very low density aggregates. If we treat the
particles as mini-nuclei, we estimate they account for <16-80% of the comet's
total water production rate (within 20.6 km). Dark dusty particles, however,
are not favored based on mass arguments. The water production rate from bright
icy particles is constrained with an upper limit of 0.1 to 0.5% of the total

equivalent of R~10 spectroscopy, which cleanly distinguishes between z~7 LBGs
and brown dwarf stars. The distinction between stars and galaxies based on an
object's angular size can become unreliable even when using HST imaging; there
exists at least one very compact z~7 candidate (FWHM~0.5-1 kpc) that is
indistinguishable from a point source. The medium-band filters provide narrower
redshift distributions compared with broad-band-derived redshifts. The UV
luminosity function derived using the three z~7 candidates is consistent with
previous studies, suggesting an evolution at the bright end (MUV -21.6 mag)
from z~7 to z~5. Fitting the galaxies' spectral energy distributions, we
predict Lyman-alpha equivalent widths for the two brightest LBGs, and find that
the presence of a Lyman-alpha line affects the medium-band flux thereby
changing the constraints on stellar masses and UV spectral slopes. This
illustrates the limitations of deriving LBG properties using only broad-band
photometry. The derived specific star-formation rates for the bright LBGs are
~13 per Gyr, slightly higher than the lower-luminosity LBGs, implying that the
star-formation rate increases with stellar mass for these galaxies.

coefficient between matter and the halo density field, which is an indicator of
the stochasticity of bias, over a wide redshift range 0\le z \le 3. The
cross-correlation coefficient is important to extract information on the matter
density field, e.g., by combining galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing
measurements. We compare the simulation results with integrated perturbation
theory (iPT) proposed by one of the present authors and standard perturbation
theory (SPT) combined with a phenomenological model of local bias. The
cross-correlation coefficient derived from the iPT agrees with N-body
simulation results down to r~15 (10) h^{-1}Mpc within 0.5 (1.0) % for all
redshifts and halo masses we consider. The SPT with local bias does not explain
complicated behaviors on quasilinear scales at low redshifts, while roughly
reproduces the general behavior of the cross-correlation coefficient on fully
nonlinear scales. The iPT is powerful to predict the cross-correlation
coefficient down to quasilinear regimes with a high precision.

Ly-alpha, [OII], [OIII], [NII], H-alpha and H-beta. We compare the metallicity
from the absorption lines in the QSO spectrum with the oxygen abundance
inferred from the strong-line methods (R23 and N2). The two emission-line
methods yield consistent results: [O/H] = -0.30+/-0.13. Based on the absorption
lines in the QSO spectrum a metallicity of -0.49+/-0.05 is inferred at an
impact parameter of 6.3 kpc from the centre of the galaxy with a column density
of hydrogen of log(N_HI)=20.65+/-0.05. The star formation rates of the galaxy
from the UV continuum and H-alpha line can be reconciled assuming an amount of
reddening of E(B-V) = 0.06+/-0.01, giving an inferred SFR of 13+/-1 M_sun / yr
(assuming a Chabrier IMF). From the HST imaging, the galaxy associated with the
absorption is found to be a compact (re=1.12 kpc) object with a disc-like,
elongated (axis ratio 0.17) structure indicating that the galaxy is seen close
to edge on. Moreover, the absorbing gas is located almost perpendicularly above
the disc of the galaxy suggesting that the gas causing the absorption is not
co-rotating with the disc. We investigate the stellar and dynamical masses from
SED-fitting and emission-line widths, respectively, and find consistent results
of 2x10^9 M_sun. We suggest that the galaxy is a young proto-disc with evidence
for a galactic outflow of enriched gas. This galaxy hints at how star-forming
galaxies may be linked to the elusive population of damped Lyman-alpha
absorbers.

considerable fraction of the sources either require or are consistent with the
presence of a spatially uniform magnetic field of a relatively small strength,

uncertainties imply, in particular, that there is no indication in current RM
data for a systematic difference between the magnetic field strengths in

inconsistent with any known class of Galactic transients, and instead suggest a
cosmological origin. The detection of incoherent radio emission at such
distances implies a large emitting region, from which we infer the presence of
relativistic ejecta. The observed properties are all consistent with the
population of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), marking the first time
such an outburst has been discovered in the distant universe independent of a
high-energy trigger. We searched for possible high-energy counterparts to
PTF11agg, but found no evidence for associated prompt emission. We therefore
consider three possible scenarios to account for a GRB-like afterglow without a
high-energy counterpart: an ""untriggered"" GRB (lack of satellite coverage), an
""orphan"" afterglow (viewing-angle effects), and a ""dirty fireball"" (suppressed
high-energy emission). The observed optical and radio light curves appear
inconsistent with even the most basic predictions for off-axis afterglow
models. The simplest explanation, then, is that PTF11agg is a normal, on-axis
long-duration GRB for which the associated high-energy emission was simply
missed. However, we have calculated the likelihood of such a serendipitous
discovery by PTF and find that it is quite small (~ 2.6%). While not
definitive, we nonetheless speculate that PTF11agg may represent a new, more
common (> 4 times the on-axis GRB rate at 90% confidence) class of relativistic
outbursts lacking associated high-energy emission.

previous measurements of the intermediate redshift MZ relation. Compared to the
local relation, we measure an evolution that corresponds to a 0.12 dex decrease
in oxygen abundances at intermediate redshifts. This result confirms the trend
that metallicity evolution becomes more significant towards lower stellar
masses, in keeping with a downsizing scenario where low mass galaxies evolve
onto the local MZ relation at later cosmic times. We show that these galaxies
follow the local fundamental metallicity relation, where objects with higher
specific (mass-normalized) star formation rates (SFRs) have lower
metallicities. Furthermore, we show that the galaxies in our sample lie on an
extrapolation of the SFR-M_{*} relation (the star-forming main sequence).
Leveraging the MZ relation and star-forming main sequence (and combining our
data with higher mass measurements from the literature), we test models that
assume an equilibrium between mass inflow, outflow and star formation. We find
that outflows are required to describe the data. By comparing different outflow
prescriptions, we show that momentum driven winds can describe the MZ relation;
however, this model under-predicts the amount of star formation in low mass
galaxies. This disagreement may indicate that preventive feedback from
gas-heating has been overestimated, or it may signify a more fundamental

present a chemical abundance analysis based on HST/COS and VLT/UVES spectra of
four AGN (RBS 144, NGC 7714, PHL 2525, and HE 0056-3622) lying behind the MS.
Two of these sightlines yield good MS metallicity measurements: toward RBS 144
we measure a low MS metallicity of [S/H]=[S II/H I]=-1.13+/-0.16 while toward
NGC 7714 we measure [O/H]=[O I/H I]=-1.24+/-0.20. Taken together with the
published MS metallicity toward NGC 7469, these measurements indicate a uniform
abundance of ~0.1 solar along the main body of the Stream. This provides strong
support to a scenario in which most of the Stream was tidally stripped from the
SMC ~1.5--2.5 Gyr ago (a time at which the SMC had a metallicity of ~0.1
solar), as predicted by several N-body simulations. However, in Paper II of
this series (Richter et al. 2013), we report a much higher metallicity (S/H=0.5
solar) in the inner Stream toward Fairall 9, a direction sampling a filament of
the MS that Nidever et al. (2008) claim can be traced kinematically to the LMC,
not the SMC. This shows that the bifurcation of the Stream is evident in its
metal enrichment. Finally we measure a similar low metallicity [O/H]=[O I/H
I]=-1.03+/-0.18 in the v_LSR=150 km/s cloud toward HE 0056--3622, which belongs
to a population of anomalous velocity clouds near the South Galactic Pole. This
suggests these clouds are associated with the Stream or more distant structures
(possibly the Sculptor Group, which lies in this direction at the same
velocity), rather than tracing foreground Galactic material.

gaseous structure in the Local Group that is believed to represent material
stripped from the Magellanic Clouds. We use ultraviolet, optical and radio data
obtained with HST/COS, VLT/UVES, FUSE, GASS, and ATCA to study metal abundances
and physical conditions in the Stream toward the quasar Fairall 9. Line
absorption in the MS from a large number of metal ions and from molecular
hydrogen is detected in up to seven absorption components, indicating the
presence of multi-phase gas. From the analysis of unsaturated SII absorption,
in combination with a detailed photoionization model, we obtain a surprisingly
high alpha abundance in the Stream toward Fairall 9 of [S/H]=-0.30pm0.04 (0.5
solar). This value is 5 times higher than what is found along other MS
sightlines based on similar COS/UVES data sets. In contrast, the measured
nitrogen abundance is found to be substantially lower ([N/H]=-1.15pm0.06),
implying a very low [N/alpha] ratio of -0.85 dex. The substantial differences
in the chemical composition of MS toward Fairall 9 compared to other sightlines
point toward a complex enrichment history of the Stream. We favour a scenario,
in which the gas toward Fairall 9 was locally enriched with alpha elements by
massive stars and then was separated from the Magellanic Clouds before the
delayed nitrogen enrichment from intermediate-mass stars could set in. Our
results support (but do not require) the idea that there is a metal-enriched
filament in the Stream toward Fairall 9 that originates in the LMC.

the probability that fewer than some threshold fraction of the points are in

approximation-size tradeoffs. We show that random sampling can be used to
construct each type of coreset, and we also provide significantly improved
bounds using discrepancy-based approaches on axis-aligned range queries.

accretion influence the global ISM of galaxies, we analyze the relationship
between recent enhancements of central star formation and total
molecular-to-atomic (H2/HI) gas ratios, using a broad sample of field galaxies
spanning early-to-late type morphologies, stellar masses of 10^(7.2-11.2) Msun,
and diverse stages of evolution. We find that galaxies occupy several loci in a
""fueling diagram"" that plots H2/HI vs. mass-corrected blue-centeredness, a
metric tracing the degree to which galaxies have bluer centers than the average
galaxy at their stellar mass. Spiral galaxies show a positive correlation
between H2/HI and mass-corrected blue-centeredness. When combined with previous
results linking mass-corrected blue-centeredness to external perturbations,
this correlation suggests a link between local galaxy interactions and
molecular gas inflow/replenishment. Intriguingly, E/S0 galaxies show a more
complex picture: some follow the same correlation, some are quenched, and a
distinct population of blue-sequence E/S0 galaxies (with masses below key
transitions in gas richness) defines a separate loop in the fueling diagram.
This population appears to be composed of low-mass merger remnants currently in
late- or post-starburst states, in which the burst first consumes the H2 while
the galaxy center keeps getting bluer, then exhausts the H2, at which point the
burst population reddens as it ages. Multiple lines of evidence suggest
connected evolutionary sequences in the fueling diagram. In particular,
tracking total gas-to-stellar mass ratios within the diagram provides evidence
of fresh gas accretion onto low-mass E/S0s emerging from central starbursts.
Drawing on a comprehensive literature search, we suggest that virtually all
galaxies follow the same evolutionary patterns found in our broad sample.

non-Fermi liquid metals is given. In metals with sharp Drude peaks, the
relevant physics is correctly organized around the slow relaxation of
almost-conserved momenta. While in Fermi liquids both currents and momenta
relax slowly, due to the weakness of interactions among low energy excitations,
in strongly interacting non-Fermi liquids typically only momenta relax slowly.
It follows that the conductivities of such non-Fermi liquids are obtained
within a fundamentally different kinematics to Fermi liquids. Among these
strongly interacting non-Fermi liquids we distinguish cases with only one
almost-conserved momentum, which we term hydrodynamic metals, and with many
patchwise almost-conserved momenta. For all these cases, we obtain universal
expressions for the ratio of conductivities that violate the Wiedemann-Franz
law. We further discuss the case in which long-lived `cold' quasiparticles, in
general with unconventional scattering rates, coexist with strongly interacting
hot spots, lines or bands. For these cases, we characterize circumstances under
which non-Fermi liquid transport, in particular a linear in temperature
resistivity, is and is not compatible with the Wiedemann-Franz law. We suggest
the likely outcome of future transport experiments on CeCoIn5, YbRh2Si2 and
Sr3Ru2O7 at their critical magnetic fields.

identified as subleading on the basis of a generalized TMD-factorization
conjecture can become leading-power because of TMD-factorization breaking that
arises in hadron-hadron collisions with large transverse momentum back-to-back
hadrons produced in the final state. General forms of TMD-factorization fail
for such processes because of a previously noted incompatibility between the
requirements for TMD-factorization and the Ward identities of non-Abelian gauge
theories. We first review the basic steps for factorizing the gluon
distribution and then show that a conflict between TMD-factorization and the
non-Abelian Ward identity arises already at the level of a single extra soft or
collinear gluon when the partonic subprocess involves a TMD gluon distribution.
Next we show that the resulting TMD-factorization violating effects produce
leading-power final state spin asymmetries that would be classified as
subleading in a generalized TMD-factorization framework. We argue that similar
extra TMD-factorization breaking effects may be necessary to explain a range of
open phenomenological QCD puzzles. The potential to observe extra transverse
spin or azimuthal asymmetries in future experiments is highlighted as their
discovery may indicate an influence from novel and unexpected large distance
parton correlations.

how soon after the Big Bang such massive starburst progenitors exist. The
measured redshift distribution of dusty, massive starbursts has long been
suspected to be biased low in redshift owing to selection effects, as confirmed
by recent findings of systems out to redshift z~5. Here we report the
identification of a massive starburst galaxy at redshift 6.34 through a

redshift from a suite of molecular and atomic fine structure cooling lines.
These measurements reveal a hundred billion solar masses of highly excited,

rise to a canonical polyhedral decomposition of the $g$-dimensional real torus

  abridged for arXiv submission",,"10.1093/mnras/stt2013",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a study of the relation between dark matter halo mass and the
baryonic content of host galaxies, quantified via luminosity and stellar mass.
Our investigation uses 154 deg2 of Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing
Survey (CFHTLenS) lensing and photometric data, obtained from the CFHT Legacy
Survey. We employ a galaxy-galaxy lensing halo model which allows us to
constrain the halo mass and the satellite fraction. Our analysis is limited to
lenses at redshifts between 0.2 and 0.4. We express the relationship between
halo mass and baryonic observable as a power law. For the luminosity-halo mass
relation we find a slope of 1.32+/-0.06 and a normalisation of
1.19+0.06-0.07x10^13 h70^-1 Msun for red galaxies, while for blue galaxies the
best-fit slope is 1.09+0.20-0.13 and the normalisation is 0.18+0.04-0.05x10^13
h70^-1 Msun. Similarly, we find a best-fit slope of 1.36+0.06-0.07 and a
normalisation of 1.43+0.11-0.08x10^13 h70^-1 Msun for the stellar mass-halo
mass relation of red galaxies, while for blue galaxies the corresponding values
are 0.98+0.08-0.07 and 0.84+0.20-0.16x10^13 h70^-1 Msun. For red lenses, the
fraction which are satellites tends to decrease with luminosity and stellar
mass, with the sample being nearly all satellites for a stellar mass of 2x10^9
h70^-2 Msun. The satellite fractions are generally close to zero for blue
lenses, irrespective of luminosity or stellar mass. This, together with the
shallower relation between halo mass and baryonic tracer, is a direct
confirmation from galaxy-galaxy lensing that blue galaxies reside in less
clustered environments than red galaxies. We also find that the halo model,
while matching the lensing signal around red lenses well, is prone to
over-predicting the large-scale signal for faint and less massive blue lenses.
This could be a further indication that these galaxies tend to be more isolated
than assumed. [abridged]

and with a beam area ~200X smaller than the original LESS observations,
doubling the current number of interferometrically-observed submillimeter
sources. The high resolution of these maps allows us to resolve sources that
were previously blended and accurately identify the origin of the submillimeter
emission. We discuss the creation of the ALESS submillimeter galaxy (SMG)
catalog, including the main sample of 99 SMGs and a supplementary sample of 32
SMGs. We find that at least 35% (possibly up to 50%) of the detected LABOCA

SMGs per LESS source increases with LESS flux density. Using the (now precisely
known) SMG positions, we empirically test the theoretical expectation for the
uncertainty in the single-dish source positions. We also compare our catalog to
the previously predicted radio/mid-infrared counterparts, finding that 45% of
the ALESS SMGs were missed by this method. Our ~1.6"" resolution allows us to
measure a size of ~9 kpc X 5 kpc for the rest-frame ~300 um emission region in
one resolved SMG, implying a star formation rate surface density of 80 M_sol
yr^-1 kpc^-2, and we constrain the emission regions in the remaining SMGs to be
<10 kpc. As the first statistically reliable survey of SMGs, this will provide
the basis for an unbiased multiwavelength study of SMG properties.

the effective temperature of the hot-electron induced by a DC electric field

tight-binding parameter $\gamma$, the Bloch oscillation frequency $\Omega$ and
the damping parameter $\Gamma$. In the small damping limit $\Gamma/\Omega\to

extremely hot in an analogy to the short-circuit effect. This leads to the
conclusion that the dissipation mechanism cannot be considered as an implicit
process, as treated in equilibrium theories. Finally, using the energy flux
relation, we derive a steady-state current for interacting models where only
on-site Green's functions are necessary.

geometry and free real algebraic geometry (RAG). The term free refers to the
central role played by algebras of noncommutative polynomials R<x> in free
(freely noncommuting) variables x=(x_1,...,x_g). The subject pertains to
problems where the unknowns are matrices or Hilbert space operators as arise in
linear systems engineering and quantum information theory.
  The subject of free RAG flows in two branches. One, free positivity and
inequalities is an analog of classical real algebraic geometry, a theory of
polynomial inequalities embodied in algebraic formulas called
Positivstellens\""atze; often free Positivstellens\""atze have cleaner statements
than their commutative counterparts. Free convexity, the second branch of free
RAG, arose in an effort to unify a torrent of ad hoc optimization techniques
which came on the linear systems engineering scene in the mid 1990's.
Mathematically, much as in the commutative case, free convexity is connected
with free positivity through the second derivative: A free polynomial is convex
if and only if its Hessian is positive. However, free convexity is a very
restrictive condition, for example, free convex polynomials have degree 2 or
less.
  This article describes for a beginner techniques involving free convexity. As
such it also serves as a point of entry into the larger field of free real
algebraic geometry.

to the statistical properties of primordial density perturbations. It can thus
be used to probe small deviations from Gaussian initial conditions. Such
deviations constitute a very important signature of many inflationary
scenarios, and are thus expected to provide crucial information on physical
processes which took place in the very early Universe.
  We have determined the biases which may be introduced in the estimation of
cosmological parameters by wrongly assuming the absence of primordial
non-Gaussianities. Although we find that the estimation of the present-day dark
energy density using cluster counts is not very sensitive to the non-Gaussian
properties of the density field, we show that the biases can be considerably
larger in the estimation of the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ and
of the amplitude of the primordial density perturbations.
  Our results suggest that a significant level of non-Gaussianity at cluster
scales may be able to reconcile the constraint on the amplitude of the

an overview of low energy experimental tests of ChPT predictions of $\pi\pi$
scattering, pion properties, $\pi$N scattering and electromagnetic pion
production. These predictions have been shown to be consistent with QCD in the
meson sector by increasingly accurate lattice calculations. At present there is
good agreement between experiment and ChPT calculations, including the $\pi\pi$
and $\pi$N s wave scattering lengths and the $\pi^{0}$ lifetime. Recent,
accurate pionic atom data are in agreement with chiral calculations once
isospin breaking effects due to the mass difference of the up and down quarks
are taken into account, as was required to extract the $\pi\pi$ scattering
lengths. In addition to tests of the theory, comparisons between $\pi\pi$ and
$\pi$N interactions based on general chiral principles are discussed. Lattice
calculations are now providing results for the fundamental, long and
inconclusively studied, $\pi$N $\sigma$ term and the contribution of the
strange quark to the mass of the proton. Increasingly accurate experiments in
electromagnetic pion production experiments from the proton which test ChPT
calculations (and their energy region of validity) are presented. These

(WIMPS) with the silicon detectors of the CDMS II experiment. This blind
analysis of 140.2 kg-days of data taken between July 2007 and September 2008
revealed three WIMP-candidate events with a surface-event background estimate
of 0.41^{+0.20}_{-0.08}(stat.)^{+0.28}_{-0.24}(syst.). Other known backgrounds
from neutrons and 206Pb are limited to < 0.13 and <0.08 events at the 90%
confidence level, respectively. The exposure of this analysis is equivalent to
23.4 kg-days for a recoil energy range of 7-100 keV for a WIMP of mass 10
GeV/c2. The probability that the known backgrounds would produce three or more
events in the signal region is 5.4%. A profile likelihood ratio test of the
three events that includes the measured recoil energies gives a 0.19%
probability for the known-background-only hypothesis when tested against the
alternative WIMP+background hypothesis. The highest likelihood occurs for a
WIMP mass of 8.6 GeV/c2 and WIMP-nucleon cross section of 1.9e-41 cm2.

spatial characteristics of base stations (BSs) and mobile users (MUs), we use
the stochastic geometry approach where BSs and MUs are modeled as independent

we show how to cope with the trade-off between broadcast and unicast for
providing the service with affordable cost levels and reduced network load.
Moreover, we propose the so called periodic broadcasting service, where popular
video contents are periodically broadcast over cellular networks. This service
will make a positive impact on the network neutrality debate by stimulating
cooperation between mobile network operators (MNOs) and content providers

particular the coherent transfer of Cooper pairs between the dot and the
superconductor. The WTDs exhibit oscillations that can be directly associated
to the coherent oscillation between the empty and doubly occupied dot. The
oscillation frequency is equal to the energy splitting between the Andreev
bound states. These effects are more pronounced when the empty state and double

pre-requisite for assessing model decision reliability in an uncertain
environment. Scenario Analysis is a methodology for modelling uncertainty in
water resources management modelling. Uncertainty if not considered
appropriately in decision making will decrease reliability of decisions,
especially in long-term planning. One of the challenges in Scenario Analysis is
how scenarios are made. One of the most approved methods is statistical
modelling based on Auto-Regressive models. Stream flow future scenarios in
developed basins that human has made changes to the natural flow process could
not be generated directly by ARMA modelling. In this case, making scenarios for
monthly rainfall and using it in a water resources system model makes more
sense. Rainfall is an ephemeral process which has zero values in some months
which introduces some limitations in making use of monthly ARMA model.
Therefore, a two stage modelling approach is adopted here which in the first
stage yearly modelling is done. Within this yearly model three ranges are
identified: Dry, Normal and Wet. In the normal range yearly ARMA modelling is
used. Dry and Wet range are considered as random processes and are modeled by
frequency analysis. Monthly distribution of rainfall, which is extracted from
available data from a moving average are considered to be deterministic and
fixed in time. Each rainfall scenario is composed of a yearly ARMA process
super-imposed by dry and wet events according to the frequency analysis. This
modelling framework is applied to available data from three rain-gauge stations
in Iran. Results show this modelling approach has better consistency with
observed data in comparison with making use of ARMA modelling alone.

usual expected polynomial spaces, which explains why only several lower order
nonconforming quadrilateral finite elements can be found in literature. The
present paper proposes two families of nonconforming finite elements of any odd

For the chicken heart LDH, the separation between successive irradiation times

developments of the theory based on analyticity and unitarity of the S-matrix,
including the derivation and exploration of the Regge trajectories and related
moving cuts. Special attention is paid to the concept of the Pomeron trajectory
introduced for description of total, elastic and diffractive cross sections at
high energies and to the emergence of the dynamics of multi-Pomeron
interactions.The role of large longitudinal distances and color coherent
phenomena for the understanding of inelastic diffraction in hadron-hadron
scattering and deep inelastic scattering is emphasized. The connection of these
phenomena to the cancellation of the contribution of the Glauber approximation
in hadron-nucleus collisions and to the understanding of the Gribov-Glauber
approximation is explained. The presence of different scales in perturbative
QCD due to masses of heavy quarks has led to the emergence of numerous new
phenomena including non-universality of the slopes of Regge trajectories made
of light and heavy quarks and non-universal energy dependence of elastic cross
sections. The application of the perturbative QCD techniques allowed us to
calculate from the first principles the interaction of small transverse size
color singlets with hadrons leading to the development of the quantitative
theory of hard exclusive reactions and to the successful prediction of many
regularities in hard large mass diffraction. It also led to the prediction of
the phenomenon of complete transparency of nuclear matter in QCD in special
processes. The conflict of perturbative QCD with probability conservation for
high energy processes of virtual photon-nucleon scattering is explained. Some
properties of the new QCD regime are outlined.

spread depends on micro-scale topology. Using the formalism of front
propagation into unstable states, we derive the effective transport
coefficients of the linear spreading: asymptotic speed, characteristic
wavelength, and diffusion coefficient for the leading edge of the pulled
fronts, and analyze their dependence on the underlying graph structure. We also
derive the epidemic threshold for the system and study the front profile for
various network configurations. To our knowledge, this is the first such
application of front propagation concepts to random network models.

and $t$ inside $P$ have been well studied. Both these kinds of paths are simple
and piecewise-convex. However, computing optimal paths in the context of
diffuse or specular reflections does not seem to be an easy task. A path from a
light source $s$ to $t$ inside $P$ is called a diffuse reflection path if the
turning points of the path lie in the interiors of the boundary edges of $P$. A
diffuse reflection path is said to be optimal if it has the minimum number of
turning points amongst all diffuse reflection paths between $s$ and $t$. The
minimum diffuse reflection path may not be simple. The problem of computing the
minimum diffuse reflection path in low degree polynomial time has remained
open.
  In our quest for understanding the geometric structure of the minimum diffuse
reflection paths vis-a-vis shortest paths and minimum link paths, we define a
new kind of diffuse reflection path called a constrained diffuse reflection
path where (i) the path is simple, (ii) it intersects only the eaves of the
Euclidean shortest path between $s$ and $t$, and (iii) it intersects each eave
exactly once. For computing a minimum constrained diffuse reflection path from
$s$ to $t$, we present an $O(n(n+\beta))$ time algorithm, where $\beta =\Theta
(n^2)$ in the worst case. Here, $\beta$ depends on the shape of the polygon. We
also establish some properties relating minimum constrained diffuse reflection
paths and minimum diffuse reflection paths. Constrained diffuse reflection
paths introduced in this paper provide new geometric insights into the hitherto
unknown structures and shapes of optimal reflection paths.

computation slicing are centralized in nature in which a single process is
responsible for computing the slice in either offline or online manner. In this
paper, we present a distributed online algorithm for computing the slice of a

ground state and an antiproton ($\bar{p}$) occupying a Rydberg state with high
principal and angular momentum quantum numbers, respectively $n$ and $\ell$,
such that $n\sim\ell\sim 38$. These atoms are amenable to precision laser

antiproton-to-electron mass ratio and to constrain the equality between the
antiproton and proton charges and masses. Here we report two-photon

$\bar{p}{\rm ^4He^+}$ isotopes are irradiated by two counter-propagating laser

simpler, and provides numerical standard errors and accurate approximations of

Sequential Monte Carlo comes very close to this ideal whereas other approaches
like Markov chain Monte Carlo do not. This paper presents a sequential
posterior simulator well suited to this computing environment. The simulator
makes fewer analytical and programming demands on investigators, and is faster,
more reliable and more complete than conventional posterior simulators. The
paper extends existing sequential Monte Carlo methods and theory to provide a
thorough and practical foundation for sequential posterior simulation that is
well suited to massively parallel computing environments. It provides detailed
recommendations on implementation, yielding an algorithm that requires only
code for simulation from the prior and evaluation of prior and data densities
and works well in a variety of applications representative of serious empirical
work in economics and finance. The algorithm is robust to pathological
posterior distributions, generates accurate marginal likelihood approximations,
and provides estimates of numerical standard error and relative numerical
efficiency intrinsically. The paper concludes with an application that

that the difference between connected (grand-canonical ensemble) and isolated

and can be neglected if the frequency of the external field, $\omega$, is of
the order of (or even slightly smaller than) the mean level spacing, $\Delta$.
If $\omega \ll \Delta$, the two-loop correction becomes important. We calculate
it by systematically evaluating the ballistic parts (the Hikami boxes) of the
corresponding diagrams and exploiting electroneutrality. Our theory allows one
to take into account a finite dephasing rate, $\gamma$, generated by electron
interactions, and it is complementary to the non-perturbative results obtained
from a combination of Random Matrix Theory (RMT) and the $\sigma$-model, valid
at $\gamma \to 0$. Remarkably, we find that the two-loop result for isolated
systems with moderately weak dephasing, $\gamma \sim \Delta$, is similar to the
result of the RMT+$\sigma$-model even in the limit $\omega \to 0$. For smaller
$\gamma$, we discuss the possibility to interpolate between the perturbative
and the non-perturbative results. We compare our results for the temperature

addressed more appropriately by considering non-Euclidean geometry. This paper
tackles the problem of sparse coding and dictionary learning in the space of
symmetric positive definite matrices, which form a Riemannian manifold. With
the aid of the recently introduced Stein kernel (related to a symmetric version
of Bregman matrix divergence), we propose to perform sparse coding by embedding
Riemannian manifolds into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. This leads to a
convex and kernel version of the Lasso problem, which can be solved
efficiently. We furthermore propose an algorithm for learning a Riemannian
dictionary (used for sparse coding), closely tied to the Stein kernel.
Experiments on several classification tasks (face recognition, texture
classification, person re-identification) show that the proposed sparse coding
approach achieves notable improvements in discrimination accuracy, in
comparison to state-of-the-art methods such as tensor sparse coding, Riemannian
locality preserving projection, and symmetry-driven accumulation of local
features.

reparametrisation symmetry) plus the well known scaling symmetry. These
variational symmetries are seen to be the simultaneous conformal Killing fields
of both the metric and the potential, thus coinciding with the conditional
symmetries defined in phase space. In a parametrisation of the lapse for which
the potential becomes constant, the generators of the aforementioned symmetries
become the Killing fields of the scaled supermetric and the homothetic field
respectively.

dimension in the presence of nearest and next nearest neighbor Hubbard
interaction. The non-interacting band structure is characterized by a symmetry
protected topologically quantized Berry phase. At certain fractional fillings,
a gapped phase with a filling-dependent ground state degeneracy, and
fractionally charged quasi-particles emerges. At filling 1/3, the ground states
carry a fractional Berry phase in the momentum basis. These features at first
glance suggest a certain analogy to the fractional quantum Hall scenario in two
dimensions. We solve the interacting model analytically in the physically
relevant limit of a large band gap in the underlying band structure, the analog
of a lowest Landau level projection. Our solution affords a simple physical
understanding of the properties of the gapped interacting phase. We pinpoint
crucial differences to the fractional quantum Hall case by studying the Berry
phase and the entanglement entropy associated with the degenerate ground
states. In particular, we conclude that the `fractional topological phase in
one-dimensional flatbands' is not a one-dimensional analog of the
two-dimensional fractional quantum Hall states, but rather a charge density
wave with a nontrivial Berry phase. Finally, the symmetry protected nature of
the Berry phase of the interacting phase is demonstrated by explicitly
constructing a gapped interpolation to a state with a trivial Berry phase.

Regarding three-flavor neutrino transport, we solve the energy-averaged set of
radiation energy and momentum based on the Thorne's momentum formalism. In
addition to the gravitational quadrupole radiation from matter motions, we take
into account GWs from anisotropic neutrino emission. With these computations,
our results present several supporting evidences for the previous anticipation

one-armed spiral modes. The typical frequency of the quasi-periodic waveforms
can be well explained by the propagating acoustic waves between the stalled

appearance of the standing-accretion-shock instability. Although the GW signals

important to consider their potential for habitability. If we consider the
circumstellar Habitable Zone (HZ, often described in terms of planet semi-major
axis and orbital eccentricity), we can ask, ""How does the HZ for an Earth-like
exomoon differ from the HZ for an Earth-like exoplanet?""
  For the first time, we use 1D latitudinal energy balance modelling to address
this question. The model places an Earth-like exomoon in orbit around a Jupiter
mass planet, which in turn orbits a Sun-like star. The exomoon's surface
temperature is evolved under the action of stellar insolation, atmospheric
cooling, heat diffusion, eclipses and tidal heating. We use this model to carry
out two separate investigations.
  In the first, four test cases are run to investigate in detail the dependence
of the exomoon climate on orbital direction, orbital inclination, and on the
frequency of stellar eclipse by the host planet. We find that lunar orbits
which are retrograde to the planetary orbit exhibit greater climate variations
than prograde orbits, with global mean temperatures around 0.1 K warmer due to
the geometry of eclipses. If eclipses become frequent relative to the
atmospheric thermal inertia timescale, climate oscillations become extremely
small.
  In the second investigation, we carry out an extensive parameter study,
running the model many times to study the habitability of the exomoon in the
4-dimensional space composed of the planet semi-major axis and eccentricity,
and the moon semi-major axis and eccentricity. We find that for zero moon
eccentricity, frequent eclipses allow the moon to remain habitable in regions
of high planet eccentricity, but tidal heating severely constrains habitability
in the limit of high moon eccentricity, making the habitable zone a sensitive
function of moon semi-major axis.

maps have an angular resolution which allows us to resolve structures of 5"",
equivalent to 2000 AU.
  Our observations reveal three spatially resolved sources within OMC-2 FIR 4,
of one or several solar masses each, with hints of further unresolved
substructure within them. Two of these sources have elongated shapes and are
associated with dust continuum emission peaks, thus likely containing at least
one molecular core each. One of them also displays radio continuum emission,
which may be attributed to a young B3-B4 star that dominates the overall
luminosity output of the region. The third source identified displays a
DCO+(2-1) emission peak, and weak dust continuum emission. Its higher abundance
of DCO+ relative to the other two regions suggests a lower temperature and
therefore its possible association with either a younger low-mass protostar or
a starless core. It may alternatively be part of the colder envelope of OMC-2

the analysis of its stellar metallicity distribution function and some key
elemental abundance patterns. Starting from the two-infall model for the
Galaxy, which predicts too few low-metallicity stars, we add a gas outflow
during the halo phase with a rate proportional to the star formation rate
through a free parameter, lambda. In addition, we consider a first generation
of massive zero-metal stars in this two-infall + outflow model adopting two
different top-heavy initial mass functions and specific population III yields.
The metallicity distribution function of halo stars, as predicted by the
two-infall + outflow model shows a good agreement with observations, when the
parameter lambda=14 and the time scale for the first infall, out of which the
halo formed, is not longer than 0.2 Gyr, a lower value than suggested
previously. Moreover, the abundance patterns [X/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] for C, N and
alpha-elements O, Mg, Si, S, Ca show a good agreement with the observational
data. If population III stars are included, under the assumption of different
initial mass functions, the overall agreement of the predicted stellar
metallicity distribution function with observational data is poorer than in the
case without population III. We conclude that it is fundamental to include both
a gas infall and outflow during the halo formation to explain the observed halo
metallicity distribution function, in the framework of a model assuming that
the stars in the inner halo formed mostly in situ. Moreover, we find that it
does not exist a satisfactory initial mass function for population III stars
which reproduces the observed halo metallicity distribution function. As a
consequence, there is no need for a first generation of only massive stars to

Mallorca, Spain, is characterized in terms of Lagrangian descriptors. The data
sets used for this study are the output for two months (one in autumn and one
in summer) of a high resolution numerical model, ROMS, forced atmospherically
and with a spatial resolution of 300 m. The two months were selected because
its different wind regime, which is the main driver of the sea dynamics in this
area. Finite-size Lyapunov Exponents (FSLEs) were used to locate
semi-persistent Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) and to understand the
different flow regimes in the Bay. The different wind directions and regularity
in the two months have a clear impact on the surface Bay dynamics, whereas only
topographic features appear clearly in the bottom structures. The fluid
interchange between the Bay and the open ocean was tudied by computing particle
trajectories and Residence Times (RT) maps. The escape rate of particles out of
the Bay is qualitatively different, with a 32$%$ more of escape rate of
particles to the ocean in October than in July, owing to the different
geometric characteristics of the flow. We show that LCSs separate regions with
different transport properties by displaying spatial distributions of residence
times on synoptic Lagrangian maps together with the location of the LCSs.
Correlations between the time-dependent behavior of FSLE and RT are also
investigated, showing a negative dependence when the stirring characterized by
FSLE values moves particles in the direction of escape.

with variable tension along its length is presented in this paper. It is shown
that standing waves develop along the hanging string. The evolution of the
Strouhal number St with the Reynolds number Re first follows a trend similar to
what is observed for a circular cylinder in a flow for relatively low Reynolds
numbers (32<Re<700). Second, the extracted mode shapes are self-similar : a
rescaling of the spanwise coordinate by a self-similarity coefficient allows
all of them to collapse on a unique function. The self-similar behaviour of the
spatial distribution of the vibrations along the hanging string is then
explained theoretically by performing a linear stability analysis of an adapted
wake-oscillator model. This linear stability analysis finally provides an
accurate description of the mode shapes and of the evolution of the
self-similarity coefficient with the flow speed.

Guided by a statistical mechanics perspective we propose a novel approach to

the percentage of jobs (temporary and permanent) given to immigrants, mixed
marriages, and newborns with parents of mixed origin. We find that the average
values of different quantifi?ers may exhibit either linear or non-linear growth
on immigrant density and we suggest that social action, a concept identified by
Max Weber, causes the observed non- linearity. Using the statistical mechanics
notion of interaction to quantitatively emulate social action, a unified
mathematical model for integration is proposed and it is shown to explain both
growth behaviors observed. The linear theory instead, ignoring the possibility
of interaction effects would underestimate the quantifiers up to 30% when
immigrant densities are low, and overestimate them as much when densities are
high. The capacity to quantitatively isolate different types of integration
mechanisms makes our framework a suitable tool in the quest for more efficient
integration policies.

The oxygen abundances were determined from the [O I] line at 6300 {\AA}. The
mean abundances of C, N and O abundances in the investigated clump stars
support our previous estimations that, compared to the Sun and dwarf stars of
the Galactic disc, carbon is depleted by about 0.2 dex, nitrogen is enhanced by
0.2 dex and oxygen is close to abundances in dwarfs. The 12C/13C and C/N ratios
for galactic red clump stars analysed were compared to the evolutionary models
of extra-mixing. The steeper drop of 12C/13C ratio in the model of thermohaline
mixing by Charbonnel & Lagarde better reflects the observational data at low
stellar masses than the more shallow model of cool bottom processing by
Boothroyd & Sackmann. For stars of about 2 Msun masses a modelling of

shows several properties similar to jets driven by low-mass protostars, such as
HH211 and HH212. It is compact and collimated, and associated with extremely
high velocity CO emission, and SiO emission at high velocities. We used a
state-of-the-art shock model to constrain the pre-shock density and shock
velocity of OF1. The model also allowed us to self-consistently estimate the
mass of the OF1 outflow. The shock parameters inferred by the SiO modelling are
comparable with those found for low-mass protostars, only with higher pre-shock
density values, yielding an outflow mass in agreement with those obtained for
molecular outflows driven by early B-type young stellar objects. Our study
shows that it is possible to model the SiO emission in high-mass star-forming

  article based on the ideas in Part I has been published in Journal of
  Mathematical Physics (JMP). A letter describing the key results of Part II
  has been submitted to European Physical Letters (EPL)",,,,"physics.acc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  (Shortened due to character limit)
  This thesis consists of two parts. In part I we consider a discrepancy in the
derivation of the electromagnetic self force for a point charge. In the point
charge framework the self force can be defined as an integral of the
Lienard-Wiechert stress 3-forms over a suitably defined worldtube. We show the
Schott term may be obtained using a null displacement vector to define the
worldtube providing certain conditions are realized.
  Part II comprises an investigation into a problem in accelerator physics. In
a high energy accelerator the cross-section of the beampipe is not continuous
and there exist geometric discontinuities such as collimators and cavities.
When a relativistic bunch of particles passes such a discontinuity the field
generated by a leading charge can interact with the wall and consequently
affect the motion of trailing charges. The fields acting on the trailing
charges are known as (geometric) wakefields. We model a bunch of particles as a
one dimensional continuum of point charges and by calculating the accumulated
Lienard-Wiechert fields we address the possibility of reducing wakefields at a
collimator interface by altering the path of the beam prior to collimation.
This approach is facilitated by the highly relativistic regime in which lepton
accelerators operate, where the Coulomb field given from the Lienard-Wiechert
potential is highly collimated in the direction of motion. It will be seen that
the potential reduction depends upon the ratio of the bunch length to the width
of the collimator aperture as well as the relativistic factor and path of the
beam. Given that the aperture of the collimator is generally on the order of
millimetres we will see that for very short bunches, on the order of hundredths
of a picosecond, a significant reduction is achieved.

from the pure CP-even case, by using the decay distributions in the process
$e^+ e^- \to t \bar{t} \Phi$, with $\Phi$ mainly decaying into a $b\bar b$
pair. We have compared the case of a minimal extension of the SM case (Model I)
with an additional pseudoscalar degree of freedom, with a more realistic case
namely the CP-violating Two-Higgs Doublet Model (Model II) that permits a more
general description of the couplings. We have considered the ILC with
$\sqrt{s}=800$\,GeV and integrated luminosity of $300\, {\rm fb}^{-1}$. Our
main findings are that even in the case of small departures from the CP-even
case, the decay distributions are sensitive to the presence of a CP-odd
component in Model II, while it is difficult to probe these departures in Model
I unless the pseudoscalar component is very large. Noting that the proposed
degrees of beam polarization increases the statistics, the process demonstrates
the effective role of beam polarization in studies beyond the Standard Model.
Further, our study shows that an indefinite CP Higgs would be a sensitive
laboratory to physics beyond the SM.

The calculations are performed using both semilocal and hybrid

cancellation effect, however, they can often provide a relatively good

temperature is lowered has been studied with the aid of a single occupancy cell
model. This model becomes more accurate as the density of the system is
increased. One of its advantages is that it permits a simple mapping to a spin
system and the effective spin Hamiltonian is easily obtained for smooth
interparticle potentials. For a binary liquid mixture the effective spin
Hamiltonian is in the universality class of the Ising spin glass in a field. No
phase transition at finite temperatures is therefore expected and the
correlation length will stay finite right down to zero temperature. For binary
mixtures of hard disks and spheres we were not able to obtain the effective
spin Hamiltonian analytically, but have done simulations to obtain its form. It
again is in the universality class of the Ising spin glass in a field. However,
in this case the effective field can be shown to go to zero at the density of
maximum packing in the model, (which is close to that of random close packing),
which means that the correlation length will diverge as the density approaches
its maximum. The exponent nu describing the divergence is related in d
dimensions to the Ising spin glass domain wall energy exponent theta.

ratio. As an example, we find that, at $z=0$, the {\em intrinsic}
(B$_{f435w}-$V$_{f606w}$) colour can be used to determine the intrinsic
rest-frame $V$-band stellar mass-to-light ratio
($\log_{10}\Gamma_{V}=\log_{10}[(M/M_{\odot})/(L_{V}/L_{V\odot})]$) with a
precision of $\sigma_{lg\Gamma}\simeq 0.06$ when the initial mass function and
redshift are known beforehand. While the presence of dust, assuming a universal
attenuation curve, can have a systematic effect on the inferred mass-to-light
ratio using a single-colour relation, this is typically small as it is often
possible to choose a colour for which the dust reddening vector is
approximately aligned with the $(m_{a}-m_{b})-\log_{10}\Gamma_{V}$ relation.
The precision with which the stellar mass-to-light ratio can be recovered using
a single colour diagnostic rivals implementations of SED fitting using more
information but in which simple parameterisations of the star formation and
metal enrichment histories are assumed. To facilitate the wide use of these
relations, we provide the optimal observer frame colour to estimate the stellar

the methyl halides as contamination originating from the spacecraft, and
ignoring lines of evidence that the two compounds originated from Mars, and
that they could not have originated from the proposed spacecraft chemistry. I
discuss why this consensus developed from the understanding of biochemistry and
geochemistry of 1976, despite its implausibility. Subsequent explanations for
the Viking methyl halides are more plausible but still not proven. The
Curiosity rover results are also being explained as a result of on-spacecraft

consider only continuous outcomes as a basis for classification, or if

outcomes of a different nature. Here, we propose a statistical method for

that deposition in the oxygen-deficient environment to be defined in our
simulations by the Pb-rich/O-poor limit stimulates a formation of the O
vacancies and the Pb interstitials both to be characterized by quite low
formation energies $\sim$ 1.0 eV. The O vacancy being occupied by two electrons
shifts a balance of electrons and holes between these two defects to excess of
electrons (four electrons against two holes) that causes the $n$-type doping.
For the Pb-poor/O-rich limit, an excess of oxygen triggers a formation of the O
interstitials characterized by such a low formation energy that spontaneous
appearance of this defect is predicted. It is shown that the concentration of
the O interstitials is able to reach the extreme magnitude equal to number of
the possible defect sites ($\sim 10^{22}$cm$^{-3}$). The localized state formed
by the O interstitial is occupied by two holes and because there are no other
defects in reasonable concentration to balance the hole redundancy, $p$-type
doping is induced.

measuring the expansion history of the universe. The thermonuclear explosion of
a white dwarf can explain their observed properties, but neither the progenitor
systems nor any stellar remnants have been conclusively identified.
Underluminous SN Ia have been proposed to originate from a so-called
double-detonation of a white dwarf. After a critical amount of helium is
deposited on the surface through accretion from a close companion, the helium
is ignited causing a detonation wave that triggers the explosion of the white
dwarf itself. We have discovered both shallow transits and eclipses in the
tight binary system CD-30 11223 composed of a carbon/oxygen white dwarf and a
hot helium star, allowing us to determine its component masses and fundamental
parameters. In the future the system will transfer mass from the helium star to
the white dwarf. Modelling this process we find that the detonation in the
accreted helium layer is sufficiently strong to trigger the explosion of the
core. The helium star will then be ejected at so large a velocity that it will
escape the Galaxy. The predicted properties of this remnant are an excellent
match to the so-called hypervelocity star US 708, a hot, helium-rich star
moving at more than 750 km/s, sufficient to leave the Galaxy. The
identification of both progenitor and remnant provides a consistent picture of
the formation and evolution of underluminous type Ia supernovae.

transcription until maturation. The participating enzymes, for example the
spliceosome for mRNAs and Drosha and Dicer for microRNAs, are also produced in
the cell and their copy-numbers fluctuate over time. Enzyme copy-number changes
affect the processing rate of the substrate molecules; high enzyme numbers
increase the processing probability, low enzyme numbers decrease it. We study
different RNA processing cascades where enzyme copy-numbers are either fixed or
fluctuate. We find that for fixed enzyme-copy numbers the substrates at
steady-state are Poisson-distributed, and the whole RNA cascade dynamics can be
understood as a single birth-death process of the mature RNA product. In this
case, solely fluctuations in the timing of RNA processing lead to variation in
the number of RNA molecules. However, we show analytically and numerically that
when enzyme copy-numbers fluctuate, the strength of RNA fluctuations increases
linearly with the RNA transcription rate. This linear effect becomes stronger
as the speed of enzyme dynamics decreases relative to the speed of RNA
dynamics. Interestingly, we find that under certain conditions, the RNA cascade
can reduce the strength of fluctuations in the expression level of the mature
RNA product. Finally, by investigating the effects of processing polymorphisms
we show that it is possible for the effects of transcriptional polymorphisms to
be enhanced, reduced, or even reversed. Our results provide a framework to
understand the dynamics of RNA processing.

aiming at mixing grains. Additionally, it plays a pivotal role in determining
the kinematics of geophysical flows. Because of segregation, the grainsize
distribution varies in space and time. Additional complications arise from the
presence of comminution, where new particles are created, enhancing
segregation. This has a feedback on the comminution process, as particles
change their local neighbourhood. Simultaneously, particles are generally
undergoing remixing, further complicating the segregation and comminution
processes. The interaction between these mechanisms is explored using a
cellular automaton with three rules: one for each of segregation, comminution
and mixing. The interplay between these rules creates complex patterns, as seen
in segregating systems, and depth dependent grading curves, which have been
observed in avalanche runout. At every depth, log-normal grading curves are

during the calculation, however there is no single (universal) value for alpha
which systematically leads to satisfying accuracy. Instead, one could use a
property of the system under consideration to determine alpha and in this way
the functional would be more flexible and potentially more accurate. Recently,
it was proposed to use the static dielectric constant epsilon for the
calculation of alpha [Shimazaki and Asai, Chem. Phys. Lett. 466, 91 (2008) and
Marques et al., Phys. Rev. B 83, 035119 (2011)]. We explore this idea further
and propose a scheme where the connection between epsilon and alpha is
optimized based on experimental band gaps. epsilon, and thus alpha, is
recalculated at each iteration of the self-consistent procedure. We present
results for the band gap and lattice constant of various semiconductors and
insulators with this procedure. In addition, we show that this approach can
also be combined with a non-self-consistent hybrid approximation to speed up
the calculations considerably, while retaining an excellent accuracy in most

describe a method for decorrelating fast and slow parameters so that parameter
sampling in the full space becomes almost as efficient as sampling in the slow
subspace when the covariance is well known and the distributions are simple.
This gives a large reduction in computational cost when there are many fast
parameters. The method can also be combined with a fast 'dragging' method
proposed by Neal (2005) that can be more robust and efficient when parameters
cannot be fully decorrelated a priori or have more complicated dependencies. I
illustrate these methods for the case of cosmological parameter estimation
using data likelihoods from the Planck satellite observations with dozens of
fast nuisance parameters, and demonstrate a speed up by a factor of five or
more. In more complicated cases, especially where the fast subspace is very
fast but complex or highly correlated, the fast-slow sampling methods can in
principle give arbitrarily large performance gains. The new samplers are

doubly lensed quasars in the R-band using four telescopes: the Mercator,
Maidanak, Himalayan Chandra, and Euler Telescopes, together spanning a period
of 7 to 8.5 observing seasons from mid-2004 to mid-2011. The photometry of the
quasar images was obtained through simultaneous deconvolution of these data.
The time delays were determined from these resulting light curves using four
very different techniques: a dispersion method, a spline fit, a regression
difference technique, and a numerical model fit. This minimizes the bias that
might be introduced by the use of a single method. Results. The time delay for
SDSS J1206+4332 is Delta_t AB = 111.3 +/- 3 days with A leading B, confirming a
previously published result within the error bars. For HS 2209+1914 we present
a new time delay of Delta_t BA = 20.0 +/- 5 days with B leading A. Conclusions.
The combination of data from up to four telescopes have led to well-sampled and
nearly 9-season-long light curves, which were necessary to obtain these

of causes of cost escalation in transport infrastructure projects. The study is
based on a sample of 258 rail, bridge, tunnel and road projects worth US$90
billion. The focus is on the dependence of cost escalation on (1) length of
project implementation phase, (2) size of project and (3) type of project
ownership. First, it is found with very high statistical significance that cost
escalation is strongly dependent on length of implementation phase. The policy
implications are clear: Decision makers and planners should be highly concerned
about delays and long implementation phases because they translate into risks
of substantial cost escalations. Second, it is found that projects have grown
larger over time and that for bridges and tunnels larger projects have larger
percentage cost escalations. Finally, by comparing cost escalation for three
types of project ownership--private, state-owned enterprise and other public
ownership--it is shown that the oft-seen claim that public ownership is
problematic and private ownership effective in curbing cost escalation is an
oversimplification. Type of accountability appears to matter more to cost
escalation than type of ownership.

existence of local and global (under a condition of smallness on the initial

belongs in the Besov space $B^{\N}_{2,\infty}(\R^{N})$.The main difficulty
concerns the proof of new estimate of maximum principle type for the linear
system associated to the Korteweg system, the proof is based on a
characterization of the Besov space in terms of the semi group associated to
this linear system. Let also point out that we prove the existence of global
strong solution with a smallness hypothesis which is subcritical in terms of
the scaling of the equations, it allows us to exhibit a family of large energy
initial data for the scaling of the equations providing global strong solution.
In particular for the first time up our knowledge we show the existence of
global strong solution for some large energy initial data when N=2. We finish
this paper by introducing the notion of quasi-solutions for the Korteweg's
system (a tool which has been developed in the framework of the compressible
Navier-Stokes equations \cite{arxiv,arxiv1,hal,cras1,cras2}) which enables us
to improve the previous result and to obtain the existence of global strong

we get global existence (and uniqueness) for highly compressible Korteweg

Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stt663",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We used K-band photometry, maximum rotational velocities derived from
Fabry-Perot data and HI observed and predicted masses to study, for the first
time, the K-band, stellar and baryonic Tully-Fisher relations for galaxies in
Hickson compact groups. We compared these relations with the ones defined for
galaxies in less dense environments from the GHASP survey and from a sample of
gas-rich galaxies. We find that most of the Hickson compact group galaxies lie
on the K-band Tully-Fisher relation defined by field galaxies with a few
low-mass outliers, namely HCG 49b and HCG 96c, which appear to have had strong
recent burst of star formation. The stellar Tully-Fisher relation for compact
group galaxies presents a similar dispersion to that of the K-band relation,
and it has no significant outliers when a proper computation of the stellar
mass is done for the strongly star-forming galaxies. The scatter in these
relations can be reduced if the gaseous component is taken into account, i.e.,
if a baryonic Tully-Fisher relation is considered. In order to explain the
positions of the galaxies off the K-band Tully-Fisher relation we favour a
scenario in which their luminosities are brightened due to strong star
formation or AGN activity. We argue that strong bursts of star formation can
affect the B and K-band luminosities of HCG 49b and HCG 96c and in the case of
the latter also AGN activity may affect the K-band magnitude considerably,
without affecting their total masses.

approach which is widely used to avoid divergence, but it has been applied
mostly to integer programs. This paper addresses the problem of accelerating
transition relations for unbounded arrays with the ultimate goal of avoiding
divergence during reachability analysis of abstract programs. For this, we
first design a format to compute accelerations in this domain; then we show how
to adapt the so-called 'monotonic abstraction' technique to efficiently handle
complex formulas with nested quantifiers generated by the acceleration
preprocessing. Notably, our technique can be easily plugged-in into
abstraction/refinement loops, and strongly contributes to avoid divergence:
experiments conducted with the MCMT model checker attest the effectiveness of
our approach on programs with unbounded arrays, where acceleration and
abstraction/refinement technologies fail if applied alone.

resistance of the nanoswitch is determined by electron tunneling through a
nanoparticle diffusing around one or more potential minima located between the
electrodes in the presence of Joule's heat dissipation. In the case of a single
potential minimum, we observe hysteresis of the resistance at finite applied
currents and a negative differential resistance. For two (or more) minima the
switching mechanism is non-volatile, meaning that the memristor can switch to a
resistive state of choice and stay there. Moreover, the noise spectra of the
switch exhibit $1/f^2\rightarrow 1/f$ crossover, in agreement with recent
experimental results.

  solution for the quasi-solution of compressible Navier-Stokes equations","60 pages, submitted to a journal the 4 January 2013",,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In \cite{arxiv,arxiv1,Kor,cras1,cras2}, we have developed a new tool called
\textit{quasi solutions} which approximate in some sense the compressible
Navier-Stokes equation. In particular it allows us to obtain global strong
solution for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with \textit{large}
initial data on the irrotational part of the velocity (\textit{large} in the
sense that the smallness assumption is subcritical in terms of scaling, it
turns out that in this framework we are able to obtain a family of large
initial data in the energy space in dimension N=2). In this paper we are
interested in proving the result anounced in \cite{cras3} concerning the
existence of global weak solution for the quasi-solutions, we also observe that
for some choice of initial data (irrotationnal) the quasi solutions verify the
porous media, the heat equation or the fast diffusion equations in function of
the structure of the viscosity coefficients. In particular it implies that it
exists classical quasi-solutions in the sense that they are $C^{\infty}$ on
$(0,T)\times\R^{N}$ for any $T>0$. Finally we show the convergence of the
global weak solution of compressible Navier-Stokes equations to the quasi
solutions in the case of a vanishing pressure limit process. In particular we
show that for highly compressible equations the speed of propagation of the
density is quasi finite when the viscosity corresponds to
$\mu(\rho)=\rho^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha>1$. Furthermore the density is not far
from converging asymptotically in time to the Barrenblatt solution of mass the
initial density $\rho_{0}$.

i.e. transferring quantum information without sending physically the
information carrier, but in RSP the sender knows the state which is to be
transmitted. We present experimental demonstrations of RSP for two and three
locations. In our experimental scheme Alice (the preparer) and her three
partners share four and six photon polarization entangled singlets. This allows
us to perform RSP of two or three copies of a single qubit states, a two qubit
Bell state, and a three qubit W, or inverse W state. A possibility to prepare a
two-qubit non-maximally entangled and GHZ states is also discussed. The ability
to remotely prepare an entangled states by local projections at Alice is a
distinguishing feature of our scheme.

  Methods: New infrared imaging data at sub-arcsec spatial resolution are
obtained for IRAS 18345-0641. The new data are used along with mid- and far-IR
imaging data, and CO (J=3-2) spectral line maps downloaded from archives to
identify the YSO and study the properties of the outflow. Available
radiative-transfer models are used to analyze the spectral energy distribution
(SED) of the YSO.
  Results: Previous tentative detection of an outflow in the H_2 (1-0) S1 line
(2.122 micron) is confirmed through new and deeper observations. The outflow
appears to be associated with a YSO discovered at infrared wavelengths. At high
angular resolution, we see that the YSO is probably a binary. The CO (3--2)
lines also reveal a well defined outflow. Nevertheless, the direction of the
outflow deduced from the H_2 image does not agree with that mapped in CO. In
addition, the age of the YSO obtained from the SED analysis is far lower than
the dynamical time of the outflow. We conclude that this is probably caused by
the contributions from a companion. High-angular-resolution observations at
mid-IR through mm wavelengths are required to properly understand the complex
picture of the star formation happening in this system, and generally in
massive star forming regions, which are located at large distances from us.

an exclusive role of bimodality as the first order phase transition signal. On
the basis of an exactly solvable statistical model generalizing the statistical
multifragmentation model of nuclei we demonstrate that the bimodal nuclear
fragment size distributions can naturally appear in infinite system without a
phase transition. It appears at the supercritical temperatures due to the
negative values of the surface tension coefficient. The developed statistical
model corresponds to the compressible nuclear liquid with the tricritical
endpoint located at one third of the normal nuclear density.

ionization of an atom by a strong optical field is often described in terms of
electron tunneling through the potential barrier resulting from the
superposition of the atomic potential and the potential associated with the
instantaneous electric component of the optical field. In the strict tunneling
regime, the electron response to the optical field is said to be adiabatic, and
nonadiabatic effects are assumed to be negligible. Here, we investigate to what
degree this terminology is consistent with a language based on the so-called
adiabatic representation. This representation is commonly used in various
fields of physics. For electronically bound states, the adiabatic
representation yields discrete potential energy curves that are connected by
nonadiabatic transitions. When applying the adiabatic representation to optical
strong-field ionization, a conceptual challenge is that the eigenstates of the
instantaneous Hamiltonian form a continuum; i.e., there are no discrete
adiabatic states. This difficulty can be overcome by applying an
analytic-continuation technique. In this way, we obtain a rigorous
classification of adiabatic states and a clear characterization of
(non)adiabatic and (non)diabatic ionization dynamics. Moreover, we distinguish
two different regimes within tunneling ionization and explain the dependence of
the ionization probability on the pulse envelope.

in both parallel scalar Gaussian channels and linear mixing systems. The
performance of the estimation process is quantified by the $\ell_\infty$ norm

with i.i.d. sparse Gaussian or mixture Gaussian inputs, under the assumption
that the relaxed belief propagation (BP) algorithm matches Tanaka's fixed point

asymptotically optimal with probability 1. However, in order to solve the
practical problem where the signal dimension is finite, we apply an estimation
algorithm that has been proposed in our previous work, and illustrate that an

The construction relies on an updated greedy algorithm for the minimization of
a suitable distance to the inverse operator. It provides a sequence of
approximations that are defined as the projections of the inverse operator in
an increasing sequence of linear subspaces of operators. These subspaces are
obtained by the tensorization of bases of operators that are constructed from
successive rank-one corrections. In order to handle high-order tensors,
approximate projections are computed in low-rank Hierarchical Tucker subsets of
the successive subspaces of operators. Some desired properties such as symmetry
or sparsity can be imposed on the approximate inverse operator during the
correction step, where an optimal rank-one correction is searched as the tensor
product of operators with the desired properties. Numerical examples illustrate
the ability of this algorithm to provide efficient preconditioners for linear
systems in tensor format that improve the convergence of iterative solvers and
also the quality of the resulting low-rank approximations of the solution.

amount of available memory to vary over time - capturing a fundamental property
of many modern computing realities, from cloud computing to multi-core and
energy-optimized processors. It turns out that good performance in the
""classic"" case provides no performance guarantees when memory capacity
fluctuates: roughly speaking, moving from static to dynamic capacity can mean
the difference between optimality within a factor 2 in space and time, and
suboptimality by an arbitrarily large factor. More precisely, adopting the
competitive analysis framework, we show that some online paging algorithms,
despite having an optimal (h,k)-competitive ratio when capacity remains
constant, are not (3,k)-competitive for any arbitrarily large k in the presence
of minimal capacity fluctuations. In this light it is surprising that several
classic paging algorithms perform remarkably well even if memory capacity
changes adversarially - even without taking those changes into explicit
account! In particular, we prove that LFD still achieves the minimum number of
faults, and that several classic online algorithms such as LRU have a ""dynamic""
(h,k)-competitive ratio that is the best one can achieve without knowledge of
future page requests, even if one had perfect knowledge of future capacity
fluctuations (an exact characterization of this ratio shows it is almost,
albeit not quite, equal to the ""classic"" ratio k/(k-h+1)). In other words, with
careful management, knowing/predicting future memory resources appears far less
crucial to performance than knowing/predicting future data accesses.

Lyn, IK Tau, and IRC+60370. We observed the 6$_{1,6}-5_{2,3}$ H$_2$O maser
rotational transition, in full-polarization mode, to determine its linear and
circular polarization. Based on the Zeeman effect, one can infer the properties
of the magnetic field from the maser polarization analysis. We detected a total
of 238 maser features, in three of the four observed sources. No masers were
found toward AP Lyn. The observed masers are all located between 2.4 and 53.0
AU from the stars. Linear and circular polarization was found in 18 and 11
maser features, respectively. We more than doubled the number of AGB stars in
which magnetic field has been detected from H$_2$O maser polarization, as our
results confirm the presence of fields around IK Tau, RT Vir and IRC+60370. The
strength of the field along the line of sight is found to be between 47 and 331
mG in the H$_2$O maser region. Extrapolating this result to the surface of the
stars, assuming a toroidal field ($\propto$ r$^{-1}$), we find magnetic fields
of 0.3-6.9 G on the stellar surfaces. If, instead of a toroidal field, we
assume a poloidal field ($\propto$ r$^{-2}$), then the extrapolated magnetic
field strength on the stellar surfaces are in the range between 2.2 and
$\sim$115 G. Finally, if a dipole field ($\propto$ r$^{-3}$) is assumed, the
field strength on the surface of the star is found to be between 15.8 and
$\sim$1945 G. The magnetic energy of our sources is higher than the thermal and
kinetic energy in the H$_2$O maser region of this class of objects. This leads
us to conclude that, indeed, magnetic fields probably play an important role in
shaping the outflows of evolved stars. (abridged)

  Science",,"10.1016/j.pss.2013.04.009",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Early Mars may have had a warmer and denser atmosphere allowing for the
presence of liquid water on the surface. However, climate model studies have
not been able to reproduce these conditions even with a CO2 atmosphere of
several bars. Recent 3D simulations of the early Mars climate show that mean
surface temperatures only slightly below 273K could be reached locally.
  We want to investigate the effect of increased partial pressures of N2 on
early Mars' surface temperature by including pressure broadening of absorption
lines and collision-induced N2-N2 absorption.
  A 1D radiative-convective cloud-free atmospheric model was used to calculate
temperature profiles and surface conditions. We performed a parameter study
varying the N2 partial pressures from 0 to 0.5bar at CO2 partial pressures
between 0.02bar and 3bar. These values are consistent with existing estimates
of the initial, pre-Noachian reservoir. Solar insolation was set to be
consistent with the late Noachian.
  Our 1D global mean simulations clearly show that enhanced N2 content in the
Martian atmosphere could have increased surface temperatures. An additional
greenhouse warming of up to 13K was found at a high N2 partial pressure of
0.5bar. Still, even at this N2 partial pressure, global mean surface
temperatures remained below 273K, i.e. the freezing point of water. However,
given the magnitude of the N2-induced surface warming and the results of recent
3D studies which show that local mean surface temperatures are not much lower
than 273K, our results imply that the presence of atmospheric N2 could have led
to almost continously habitable mean surface conditions in some regions. In
addition, atmospheric water column amounts increased by up to a factor of 6 in
response to the surface warming, indicating that precipitation might also
increase upon increasing N2 partial pressure.

smaller than those of the RIT strands. Microstructures were investigated in
order to find out the reasons for the difference in non-Cu Jc values. Their
grain size and stoichiometry were found to be comparable, leading to similar
layer Jcs. Accordingly it was determined that the lower A15 area fraction
rather than the quality of A15 layer was the cause of the discrepancy in non-Cu
Jc. Subsequently, the area utilizations of subelements were investigated. While
for a RIT strand the fine grain (FG) A15 area occupies ~60% of a subelement,
for a Tube Type strand it is no more than 40%. Further analysis indicates that
the low FG area fraction in a Tube Type strand is attributed to its much larger
unreacted Nb area fraction. Finally, a simple change in strand architecture is
proposed to reduce the unreacted Nb area fraction.

graphical models that work well under low-complexity message-passing
algorithms. Although much progress has been made on the analysis of spatially
coupled models under message passing, there is still room for improvement, both
in terms of simplifying existing proofs as well as in terms of proving
additional properties.
  We introduce one further tool for the analysis, namely the concept of
displacement convexity. This concept plays a crucial role in the theory of
optimal transport and, quite remarkably, it is also well suited for the
analysis of spatially coupled systems. In cases where the concept applies,
displacement convexity allows functionals of distributions which are not convex
in the usual sense to be represented in an alternative form, so that they are
convex with respect to the new parametrization. As a proof of concept we
consider spatially coupled $(l,r)$-regular Gallager ensembles when transmission
takes place over the binary erasure channel. We show that the potential
function of the coupled system is displacement convex. Due to possible
translational degrees of freedom convexity by itself falls short of
establishing the uniqueness of the minimizing profile. For the spatially
coupled $(l,r)$-regular system strict displacement convexity holds when a
global translation degree of freedom is removed. Implications for the
uniqueness of the minimizer and for solutions of the density evolution equation
are discussed.

cell through 28 and 27.2 electrons towards the case of 26.52, which corresponds
to chemical composition K{0.76}Fe{1.72}Se2 studied in recent ARPES experiments.
In general case the increase of hole doping leads to quasiparticle bands in
wide energy window +/-2 eV around the Fermi level becoming more broadened by
lifetime effects, while correlation induced compression of Fe-3d LDA'
bandwidths stays almost the same and of the order of ~1.3 for all hole
concentrations. However close to the Fermi level situation is more complicated.
Here in the energy interval from -1.0 eV to 0.4 eV the bare Fe-3d LDA' bands
are compressed by significantly larger renormalization factors up to 5 with
hole doping increase, while the value of Coulomb interaction remains the same.
This fact manifests the increase of correlation effects with hole doping in
K{1-x}Fe{2-y}Se2 system. Moreover in contrast to typical pnictides
K{1-x}Fe{2-y}Se2 does not have well defined quasiparticle bands on the Fermi
leves but pseudogap like ""dark"" region instead. We also find that with the
growth of hole doping Fe-3d orbitals of various symmetries are affected by
correlations in a different way in different parts of Brillouin zone. To
illustrate this we determine quasiparticle mass renormalization factors and
energy shifts, which transform the bare Fe-3d LDA' bands of various symmetries
into LDA'+DMFT quasiparticle bands. These renormalization factors effectively
mimic more complicated energy dependent self-energy effects and can be used to
analyze the available ARPES data.

new topology which allows to link the discrete and the continuous dynamics by
considering them as instances of the same strong Markov process with different
initial conditions. We construct this pruning process on the space of so-called
bi-measure trees, which are metric measure spaces with an additional pruning
measure. The pruning measure is assumed to be finite on finite trees, but not
necessarily locally finite. We also characterize the pruning process
analytically via its Markovian generator and show that it is continuous in the

finite variance offspring case where the pruning measure is the length measure

determine if three-dimensional accretion discs simulated by the Smoothed

ability of SPH artificial viscosity to mimic a physical-like viscosity under
specific conditions, we show how the same artificial viscosity prescription
behaves like an implicit turbulence model. In fact, we identify a threshold for
the parameters in the standard artificial viscosity above which SPH disc models
present a cascade in the power spectrum of velocity fluctuations, turbulent
diffusion and a mass accretion rate of the same order of magnitude as measured
in observations. Furthermore, the turbulence properties observed locally in SPH
disc models are accompanied by meridional circulation in the global flow of the
gas, proving that the two mechanisms can coexist.

range of applications. This makes its complexity a fundamental problem in
computer science. Depending on the context, solving has different meanings. In
order to stick to the most general case, we consider a representation of the
solutions from which one can easily recover the exact solutions or a certified
approximation of them. Under generic assumption, such a representation is given
by the lexicographical Gr\""obner basis of the system and consists of a set of
univariate polynomials. The best known algorithm for computing the
lexicographical Gr\""obner basis is in $\widetilde{O}(d^{3n})$ arithmetic
operations where $n$ is the number of variables and $d$ is the maximal degree
of the equations in the input system. The notation $\widetilde{O}$ means that
we neglect polynomial factors in $n$. We show that this complexity can be
decreased to $\widetilde{O}(d^{\omega n})$ where $2 \leq \omega < 2.3727$ is
the exponent in the complexity of multiplying two dense matrices. Consequently,
when the input polynomial system is either generic or reaches the B\'ezout
bound, the complexity of solving a polynomial system is decreased from
$\widetilde{O}(D^3)$ to $\widetilde{O}(D^\omega)$ where $D$ is the number of
solutions of the system. To achieve this result we propose new algorithms which
rely on fast linear algebra. When the degree of the equations are bounded
uniformly by a constant we propose a deterministic algorithm. In the unbounded
case we present a Las Vegas algorithm.

V1135\,Her were obtained. The brighter component of V1135\,Her is a Cepheid
variable with a pulsation period of 4.22433$\pm$0.00026 days. The orbital
period of the system is about 39.99782$\pm$0.00233 days, which is the shortest
value among the known Type\,II Cepheid binaries. The observed B, V, and R
magnitudes were cleaned for the intrinsic variations of the primary star. The
remaining light curves, consisting of eclipses and proximity effects, are
obtained. Our analyses of the multi-colour light curves and radial velocities
led to the determination of fundamental stellar properties of both components
of the interesting system V1135\,Her. The system consists of two evolved stars,
G1+K3 between giants and supergiants, with masses of M$_1$=1.461$\pm$0.054
\Msun ~and M$_2$=0.504$\pm$0.040 {\Msun} and radii of R$_1$=27.1$\pm$0.4
{\Rsun} and R$_2$=10.4$\pm$0.2 {\Rsun}. The pulsating star is almost filling
its corresponding Roche lobe which indicates the possibility of mass loss or
transfer having taken place. We find an average distance of d=7500$\pm$450 pc
using the BVR magnitudes and also the V-band extinction. Location in the Galaxy
and the distance to the galactic plane with an amount of 1300 pc indicate that
it probably belongs to the thick-disk population. Most of the observed and
calculated parameters of the V1135\,Her and its location on the color-magnitude
and period-luminosity diagrams lead to a classification of an Anomalous
Cepheid.

to be excluded by limits from the XENON experiments, it is interesting that
most of this tension can go away if the WIMP-nucleon interaction violates
isospin. This motivates us to explore some of the implications for models in
which a real gauge-singlet scalar particle, the darkon, serves as the WIMP,
taking into account the recent discovery of a Higgs boson at the LHC and Planck
determination of the DM relic density. In the simplest scenario, involving only
the standard model plus a darkon, the Higgs boson is largely invisible due to
its decay into a pair of darkons having the WIMP mass suggested by CDMS II and
hence cannot be identified with the one found at the LHC. We find, on the other
hand, that a two-Higgs-doublet model supplemented with a darkon has ample
parameter space to accommodate well both the new potential DM hint from CDMS II
and the Higgs data from the LHC, whether or not the darkon-nucleon interaction
conserves isospin.

arbitrary additive categories (generalizing those defined by Cohn for rings)
are closely (and naturally) related with weight structures. Localizing an
arbitrary triangulated $C$ by a set $S$ of morphisms in the heart of a weight
structure $w$ for it one obtains a triangulated category endowed with a weight
structure $w'$. The heart of $w'$ is a certain idempotent completion of the
non-commutative localization of the heart of $w$ by $S$. The latter is the
natural categorical version of Cohn's localizations of rings i.e. the functor
connecting hearts is universal among all the additive functors that make the
elements of $S$ invertible. In particular, taking $C=K^b(A)$ for an additive
$A$ we obtain a very efficient tool for computing the additive localization of
$A$ by $S$; using it, we generalize the calculations of Gerasimov and
Malcolmson.
  We apply our results to certain categories of birational motives over a base
scheme $U$ (generalizing those defined by Kahn and Sujatha). When $U$ is the
spectrum of a perfect field, the weight structure obtained is compatible with
the Chow and Gersten weight structures defined by the first author in previous
papers. For a general $U$ the result is completely new.
  We also consider the relation of weight structures with their adjacent
t-structures (in localizations). In the 'motivic' setting mentioned this yields
the natural generalization of the 'duality' between birational motives and
birational sheaves with transfers established by Kahn and Sujatha.

baryon distribution in groups and clusters and its use as a cosmological
constraint. For this, we considered a sample of 123 systems, with total masses
in the mass range M500 = ~ 10^13 - 4 x 10^15 h_70^-1 Msun.
  The gas masses and total masses are derived from X-ray data under the
assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium and spherical symmetry. The stellar
masses are based on SDSS-DR8 data. For the 37 systems out of 123 that had both
optical and X-ray data available, we investigated the gas, stellar and total
baryon mass fractions inside r2500 and r500, and the differential gas mass
fraction within the spherical annulus between r2500 and r500, as a function of
total mass. For the other objects, we investigated the gas mass fraction only.
We find that the gas mass fraction inside r2500 and r500 depends on the total
mass.
  However, the differential gas mass fraction does not show any dependence on
total mass for systems with M500 > 10^14 Msun. We find that the total baryonic
content increases with cluster mass. This led us to investigate the
contribution of the ICL to the total baryon budget for lower mass systems, but
we find that it cannot account for the difference observed. The gas mass
fraction dependence on total mass observed for groups and clusters could be due
to the difficulty of low-mass systems to retain gas inside the inner region.
Due to their shallower potential well, non-thermal processes are more effective
in expelling the gas from their central regions outwards. Since the
differential gas mass fraction is nearly constant it provides better
constraints for cosmology.
  Using our total f_b estimates, our results imply 0.17 < Omega_m < 0.55.

this paper. The working principle is demonstrated using a tunable waveguide
micro ring resonator and single photodiode. The initial calibration is done
with a set of known wavelengths and resonator tunings. The combined spectral
sensitivity function of the resonator and photodiode at each tuning voltage was
modeled by a neural network. For determining the unknown wavelengths, the
resonator was tuned with a set of heating voltages and the corresponding
photodiode signals are collected. The unknown wavelength was estimated, based
on the collected photodiode signals, the calibrated neural networks, and an
optimization algorithm. The wavelength estimate method provides a high spectral
precision of about 8 pm (5*10^(-6) at 1550 nm) in the wavelength range between
1549 nm to 1553 nm. A higher precision of 5 pm (3*10^(-6)) is achieved in the
range between 1550.3 nm to 1550.8 nm, which is a factor of five improved
compared to a simple lookup of data. The importance of our approach is that it
strongly simplifies the optical system and enables optical integration. The
approach is also of general importance, because it may be applicable to all
wavelength monitoring devices which show an adjustable wavelength response.

eliminating interferences and creating the necessary isolation between multiple

nearby face-on disks, using deep 3.6um images from the Spitzer Survey of
Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S4G). In particular, we have studied the
structural properties of those disks with a broken or down-bending profile. We
find that, on average, disks with a genuine single exponential profile have a
scale-length and a central surface brightness which are intermediate to those
of the inner and outer components of a down-bending disk with the same total
stellar mass. In the case of barred galaxies, the ratio between the break and
the bar radii (Rbr/Rbar) depends strongly on the total stellar mass of the
galaxy. For galaxies more massive than 10^10 Msun, the distribution is bimodal,
peaking at Rbr/Rbar~2 and ~3.5. The first peak, which is the most populated
one, is linked to the Outer Lindblad Resonance of the bar, whereas the second
one is consistent with a dynamical coupling between the bar and the spiral
pattern. For galaxies below 10^10 Msun, breaks are found up to ~10 Rbar, but we
show that they could still be caused by resonances given the rising nature of
rotation curves in these low-mass disks. While not ruling out star formation
thresholds, our results imply that radial stellar migration induced by
non-axysymmetric features can be responsible not only for those breaks at 2
Rbar, but also for many of those found at larger radii.

conserve number density in the mapping from the linear to nonlinear regime,
matches the measured abundance to within 16% for a range of void radii 1<

voids and assumes that voids of a similar size merge as they expand by a factor
of 1.7 to achieve a nonlinear density of \rho_v = 0.2\rho_m today. We find that
the model of Sheth & van de Weygaert (2004) for the number density of voids
greatly overpredicts the abundances over the same range of scales. We find that
the volume conserving model works well at matching the number density of voids

correctly predicting the abundances to within 25% in a simulation of a matter

of cluster mergers on resolved SZE images, we present a high-resolution
cosmological simulation of a 1.5E15 M_sun adiabatic cluster using the TreeSPH
code ChaNGa. This massive cluster undergoes a 10:3:1 ratio triple merger
accompanied by a dramatic rise in its integrated Compton-Y, peaking at z =
0.05. By modeling the thermal SZE (tSZ) and kinetic SZE (kSZ) spectral
distortions of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) at this redshift with
relativistic corrections, we produce various mock images of the cluster at
frequencies and resolutions achievable with current high-resolution SZE
instruments. The two gravitationally-bound merging subclusters account for 10%
and 1% of the main cluster's integrated Compton-Y, and have extended merger
shock features in the background ICM visible in our mock images. We show that
along certain projections and at specific frequencies, the kSZ CMB intensity
distortion can dominate over the tSZ due to the large line of sight velocities
of the subcluster gas and the unique frequency-dependence of these effects. We
estimate that a one-velocity assumption in estimation of line of sight
velocities of the merging subclusters from the kSZ induces a bias of ~10%. This
velocity bias is small relative to other sources of uncertainty in
observations, partially due to helpful bulk motions in the background ICM
induced by the merger. Our results show that high-resolution SZE observations,
which have recently detected strong kSZ signals in subclusters of merging
systems, can robustly probe the dynamical as well as the thermal state of the
ICM.

considering source size as well as radio luminosity; effectively the source
size acts as a proxy for source age. Based on a sample of FR-II radio sources

determine a new expression for jet power that accounts for the source size,
Q_jet / 10^{36} W = 1.5 (L_151 / 10^{27} W/Hz)^{0.8} (1+z)^{1.0} (D /

any derived radio luminosity - jet power relation depends sensitively on sample
properties, in particular the source size distribution and the size-luminosity
correlation inherent in the sample. Such bias will affect the accuracy of the
kinetic luminosity function derived from lobe radio luminosities and should be

secondary (mass ratio q < 1). To account for the principle effects of general
relativity (GR), we propose a modification of the standard Newtonian evolution
equation for the (orbit-averaged) time-varying disk surface density. In our
modified equation the viscous torque in the disk is treated in full GR, while
the tidal torque is handled in the Newtonian limit. Our GR-hybrid treatment is
reasonable because the tidal torque is concentrated near the orbital radius of
the secondary and is most important prior to binary-disk decoupling, when the
orbital separation is large and resides in the weak-field regime. The tidal
torque on the disk diminishes during late merger and vanishes altogether
following merger. By contrast, the viscous torque drives the flow into the
strong-field region and onto the primary during all epochs. Following binary
coalescence, the viscous torque alone governs the time-dependent accretion onto
the remnant, as well as the temporal behavior, strength and spectrum of the
aftermath electromagnetic radiation from the disk. We solve our GR-hybrid
equation for a representative BHBH-disk system, identify several observable EM
signatures of the merger, and compare results obtained for the gas and EM

Here I present a brief review of the state of wind studies in black hole X-ray
binaries, focusing on recent arguments that disk winds are not only extremely
massive, but also highly variable. I show how new and archival observations at
high timing and spectral resolution continue to highlight the intricate links
between the inner accretion flow, relativistic jets, and accretion disk winds.
Finally, I discuss methods to infer the driving mechanisms of observed disk
winds and their implications for connections between mass accretion and

noise signal, the residuals due to the data reduction of the wide field, and
the overall signal produced by faint galaxies. The ratio of the signal in the
i_775 and z_850 bands is used to estimate the contribution of the faint

various sources of uncertainty and quantify the number of faint i-dropout
galaxies in the field. The analysis allows us to put constraints on the
luminosity function at $z\sim6$ down to z_850= 30 mag, 2.5 mag fainter than

when representing shapes like curves or surfaces as currents. In the field of
computational anatomy, the framework of currents has indeed proved very
efficient to model a wide variety of shapes. However, in such approaches,
orientation of shapes is a fundamental issue that can lead to several drawbacks
in treating certain kind of datasets. More specifically, problems occur with
structures like acute pikes because of canceling effects of currents or with
data that consists in many disconnected pieces like fiber bundles for which
currents require a consistent orientation of all pieces. As a promising
alternative to currents, varifolds, introduced in the context of geometric
measure theory by F. Almgren, allow the representation of any non-oriented
manifold (more generally any non-oriented rectifiable set). In particular, we
explain how varifolds can encode numerically non-oriented objects both from the
discrete and continuous point of view. We show various ways to build a Hilbert
space structure on the set of varifolds based on the theory of reproducing
kernels. We show that, unlike the currents' setting, these metrics are
consistent with shape volume (theorem 4.1) and we derive a formula for the
variation of metric with respect to the shape (theorem 4.2). Finally, we
propose a generalization to non-oriented shapes of registration algorithms in
the context of Large Deformations Metric Mapping (LDDMM), which we detail with
a few examples in the last part of the paper.

an entangled quantum state as a consequence of conservation laws in the decay

entanglement and the correlations in the time evolution of the product
particles to study CP and T violations. If one (or more) of the product
particles are not observed, their degrees of freedom are traced out of the pure
state density matrix resulting from the decay, leading to a mixed state density
matrix and an entanglement entropy. This entropy is a measure of the loss of

state. We use the Wigner-Weisskopf method to construct an approximation to this
state that evolves in time in a {\em manifestly unitary} way. We then obtain
the entanglement entropy from the reduced density matrix of one of the daughter
particles obtained by tracing out the unobserved states, and follow its time
evolution. We find that it grows over a time scale determined by the lifetime
of the parent particle to a maximum, which when the width of the parent
particle is narrow, describes the phase space distribution of maximally
entangled Bell-like states. The method is generalized to the case in which the

capture into the 7:6 resonance. Stochastic forcing can eject the system from

migration and stochastic forcing is depleted soon after resonance capture.
  We explore a scenario with approximately Mars mass embryos originating
exterior to the two planets and migrating inwards toward two planets. We find
that gravitational interactions with embryos can nudge the system out of
resonances. Numerical integrations with about a half dozen embryos can leave
the two planets in the 7:6 resonance. Collisions between planets and embryos
have a wide distribution of impact angles and velocities ranging from
accretionary to disruptive. We find that impacts can occur at sufficiently high
impact angle and velocity that the envelope of a planet could have been
stripped, leaving behind a dense core. Some of our integrations show the two
planets exchanging locations, allowing the outer planet that had experienced
multiple collisions with embryos to become the innermost planet. A scenario

order to improve both the approximation of displacements and crack geometry.
The performance of this modelling approach is demonstrated on two numerical
examples that qualitatively illustrate its ability to predict complex crack
paths. All problems are three-dimensional, including a torsion problem that
results in the accurate prediction of a doubly-curved crack.

more general group-like algebraic structures. These algebraic structures are
closely related to tensor categories and have played important roles in knot
theory, quantum groups, statistical mechanics, and topological quantum field
theory. There's a measure of size of a subfactor, called the index. Remarkably
the values of the index below 4 are quantized, which suggests that it may be
possible to classify subfactors of small index. Subfactors of index at most 4
were classified in the '80s and early '90s. The possible index values above 4
are not quantized, but once you exclude a certain family it turns out that
again the possibilities are quantized. Recently the classification of
subfactors has been extended up to index 5, and (outside of the infinite

anomaly, the correlation functions may manifest effective restoration of the
symmetry in the high temperature phase. We explicitly study this possibility by
calculating the meson correlators as well as the Dirac operator spectral
density near the critical point. Our numerical simulations are performed on a
$16^3\times 8$ lattice with two flavors of dynamical quarks represented by the
overlap fermion formalism. Chiral symmetry and its violation due to the axial
anomaly is manifestly realized with this formulation, which is a prerequisite
for the study of the effective restoration of the axial U(1) symmetry. In order
to avoid discontinuity in the gauge configuration space, which occurs for the
exactly chiral lattice fermions, the simulation is confined in a fixed
topological sector. It induces finite volume effect, which is well described by
a formula based on the Fourier transform from the $\theta$-vacua. We confirm
this formula at finite temperature by calculating the topological
susceptibility in the quenched theory. Our two flavor simulations show
degeneracy of the meson correlators and a gap in the Dirac operator spectral
density, which implies that the axial U(1) symmetry is effectively restored in
the chirally symmetric phase.

emphasizes the benefits of making contact with the world across the entire

development of robots that can control their contact forces during
goal-directed motion. Inspired by biology, we assume that the robot has
low-stiffness actuation at its joints, and tactile sensing across the entire
surface of its manipulator. We then describe a novel controller that exploits
these assumptions. The controller only requires haptic sensing and does not
need an explicit model of the environment prior to contact. It also handles
multiple contacts across the surface of the manipulator. The controller uses
model predictive control (MPC) with a time horizon of length one, and a linear
quasi-static mechanical model that it constructs at each time step. We show
that this controller enables both real and simulated robots to reach goal
locations in high clutter with low contact forces. Our experiments include
tests using a real robot with a novel tactile sensor array on its forearm
reaching into simulated foliage and a cinder block. In our experiments, robots
made contact across their entire arms while pushing aside movable objects,
deforming compliant objects, and perceiving the world.

Australia; New York City, Atlantic coast of USA; Honolulu, U.S. state of
Hawaii; San Diego, U.S. state of California; and Venice, Mediterranean Sea,

index. Finally, a global reconstruction of sea level and a reconstruction of
the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index are analyzed and compared: both
sequences cover about three centuries from 1700 to 2000. The proposed
methodology quickly highlights oscillations and teleconnections among the
records at the decadal and multidecadal scales. At the secular time scales tide
gauge records present relatively small (positive or negative) accelerations, as
found in other studies. On the contrary, from the decadal to the secular scales
(up to 110-year intervals) the tide gauge accelerations oscillate significantly
from positive to negative values mostly following the PDO, AMO and NAO
oscillations. In particular, the influence of a large quasi 60-70 year natural
oscillation is clearly demonstrated in these records. The multiscale dynamical
evolutions of the rate and of the amplitude of the annual seasonal cycle of the

new physics at an experimentally accessible scale, even with O(1) Yukawa
couplings. In the inverse seesaw scenario, the smallness of neutrino masses is
linked to the smallness of a lepton number violating parameter. This parameter
may arise radiatively. In this paper, we study the cosmological implications of
two contrasting radiative inverse seesaw models, one due to Ma and the other to
Law and McDonald. The former features spontaneous, the latter explicit lepton
number violation. First, we examine the effect of the lepton-number violating
interactions introduced in these models on the baryon asymmetry of the
universe. We investigate under what conditions a pre-existing baryon asymmetry
does not get washed out. While both models allow a baryon asymmetry to survive
only once the temperature has dropped below the mass of their heaviest fields,
the Ma model can create the baryon asymmetry through resonant leptogenesis.
Then we investigate the viability of the dark matter candidates arising within
these models, and explore the prospects for direct detection. We find that the
Law/McDonald model allows a simple dark matter scenario similar to the Higgs
portal, while in the Ma model the simplest cold dark matter scenario would tend
to overclose the universe.

For convection-driven incompressible spherical shell dynamos with constant
material properties, scaling laws had been established previously that relate
flow velocity and magnetic field strength to the available power. Here we
analyze 273 direct numerical simulations using the anelastic approximation,
involving also cases with radius-dependent magnetic, thermal and viscous
diffusivities. These better represent conditions in gas giant planets and
low-mass stars compared to Boussinesq models. Our study provides strong support

p^{-(q^f-1)/p}\mod q, $$ and a result of same nature if $q$ divides $u^p-v^p$,

Unlike most prior works, which either assumed a specific network shape or
considered a special location of the reference receiver, we propose two general
frameworks for analytically computing the outage probability at any arbitrary
location of an arbitrarily-shaped finite wireless network: (i) a moment
generating function-based framework which is based on the numerical inversion
of the Laplace transform of a cumulative distribution and (ii) a reference link
power gain-based framework which exploits the distribution of the fading power
gain between the reference transmitter and receiver. The outage probability is
spatially averaged over both the fading distribution and the possible locations
of the interferers. The boundary effects are accurately accounted for using the
probability distribution function of the distance of a random node from the
reference receiver. For the case of the node locations modeled by a Binomial
point process and Nakagami-$m$ fading channel, we demonstrate the use of the
proposed frameworks to evaluate the outage probability at any location inside
either a disk or polygon region. The analysis illustrates the location
dependent performance in finite wireless networks and highlights the importance
of accurately modeling the boundary effects.

generalizations of Futw\""angler's theorems for the second case of Fermat's Last
Theorem (FLT2). Let $p$ be an odd prime, $\zeta$ a $p$th primitive root of
unity, $K:=\Q(\zeta)$ and $C\ell_K$ the class group of $K$. A prime $q$ is said
$p$-principal if the class $c\ell_K (\mk q_K)\in C\ell_K$ of any prime ideal
$\mk q_K$ of $\Z_K$ over $q$ is the $p$th power of a class.
  Assume that FLT2 fails for $(p,x,y,z)$ where $x, y, z$ are mutually coprime
integers, $p$ divides $y$ and $x^p+y^p+z^p=0$. Let $q$ be a prime dividing
$\frac{(x^p+y^p)(y^p+z^p)(z^p+x^p)}{(x+y)(y+z)(z+x)}$ and $\mk q_K$ be any
prime ideal of $K$ over $q$. We obtain the $p$-power residue symbols relations:
  $$(\frac{p}{\mk q_K})_K=(\frac{1-\zeta^j}{\mk q_K})_K for j=1,\dots,p-1.$$
  As an application, we prove that: if Vandiver's conjecture holds for $p$ then
$q$ is a $p$-principal prime.
  Similarly, let $q$ be a prime dividing
$\frac{(x^p-y^p)(y^p-z^p)(z^p-x^p)}{(x-y)(y-z)(z-x)}$ and $\mk q_K$ be the
prime ideal of $K$ over $q$ dividing $(x\zeta-y)(z\zeta-y)(x\zeta -z)$. We give
an explicit formula for the $p$-power residue symbols $(\frac{\epsilon_{k}}{\mk
q_K})_K$ for all $k$ with $1<k\leq\frac{p-1}{2},$ where $\epsilon_k$ is the
cyclotomic unit given by
$\epsilon_k=:\zeta^{(1-k)/2}\cdot\frac{1+\zeta^k}{1+\zeta}.$
  The principle of proofs rely on the $p$-Hilbert class field theory.

energy than they receive from the Sun. Applying the first and second principles
of thermodynamics, one can determine their cooling rate, luminosity, and
temperature at a given age. Measurements of Saturn's infrared intrinsic
luminosity, however, reveal that this planet is significantly brighter than
predicted for its age. This excess luminosity is usually attributed to the
immiscibility of helium in the hydrogen-rich envelope, leading to ""rains"" of
helium-rich droplets. Existing evolution calculations, however, suggest that
the energy released by this sedimentation process may not be sufficient to
resolve the puzzle. Here, we demonstrate using planetary evolution models that
the presence of layered convection in Saturn's interior, generated, like in
some parts of Earth oceans, by the presence of a compositional gradient,
significantly reduces its cooling. It can explain the planet's present
luminosity for a wide range of configurations without invoking any additional
source of energy. This suggests a revision of the conventional homogeneous
adiabatic interior paradigm for giant planets, and questions our ability to
assess their heavy element content. This reinforces the possibility for layered
convection to help explaining the anomalously large observed radii of
extrasolar giant planets.

Tully-Fisher relations. We examine possible environmental dependencies and
differences between normal spirals and ""dusty red"" galaxies, i.e. disk galaxies
that have red colors due to relatively low star formation rates. We find no
significant differences between the best-fit TF slope of cluster and field
galaxies. At fixed slope, the field population with high-quality rotation
curves (57 objects) is brighter by $\Delta M_{B}=-0\fm42\pm0\fm15$ than the
cluster population (55 objects). We show that this slight difference is at
least in part an environmental effect. The scatter of the cluster TFR increases
for galaxies closer to the core region, also indicating an environmental
effect. Interestingly, dusty red galaxies become fainter towards the core at
given rotation velocity (i.e. total mass). This indicates that the star
formation in these galaxies is in the process of being quenched. The
luminosities of normal spiral galaxies are slightly higher at fixed rotation
velocity for smaller cluster-centric radii. Probably these galaxies are
gas-rich (compared to the dusty red population) and the onset of ram-pressure
stripping increases their star-formation rates. The results from the TF
analysis are consistent with and complement our previous findings. Dusty red
galaxies might be an intermediate stage in the transformation of infalling
field spiral galaxies into cluster S0s, and this might explain the well-known
increase of the S0 fraction in galaxy clusters with cosmic time.

due to its technological importance as a model alloy for Cu steels. In spite of
these efforts several aspects of its phase diagram remain unexplained. Here we
use atomistic simulations to characterize the polymorphic phase diagram of Cu
precipitates in body-centered cubic (BCC) Fe and establish a consistent link
between their thermodynamic and mechanical properties in terms of thermal
stability, shape, and strength. The size at which Cu precipitates transform
from BCC to a close-packed 9R structure is found to be strongly temperature
dependent, ranging from approximately 4 nm in diameter (~2,700 atoms) at 200 K
to about 8 nm (~22,800 atoms) at 700 K. These numbers are in very good
agreement with the interpretation of experimental data given Monzen et al.
[Phil. Mag. A 80, 711 (2000)]. The strong temperature dependence originates
from the entropic stabilization of BCC Cu, which is mechanically unstable as a
bulk phase. While at high temperatures the transition exhibits first-order
characteristics, the hysteresis, and thus the nucleation barrier, vanish at
temperatures below approximately 300\,K. This behavior is explained in terms of
the mutual cancellation of the energy differences between core and shell
(wetting layer) regions of BCC and 9R nanoprecipitates, respectively. The
proposed mechanism is not specific for the Fe--Cu system but could generally be
observed in immiscible systems, whenever the minority component is unstable in
the lattice structure of the host matrix. Finally, we also study the
interaction of precipitates with screw dislocations as a function of both
structure and orientation. The results provide a coherent picture of
precipitate strength that unifies previous calculations and experimental
observations.

is that the ordering between a pair of jobs is not well-defined, and might
depend on where the jobs lie in the schedule and also on the jobs between them.
We investigate this question systematically and substantially generalize the
previously known results in this direction. These results lead to interesting
new dominance properties among schedules which lead to huge speed up in exact
algorithms for the problem. An experimental study evaluates the impact of these
properties on the exact algorithm A*.

generalizations of abelian varieties defined over L with endomorphisms also

gives rise to a Galois representation provided by the Galois action on its Tate
module. This classical Galois representation has been a central object of study
in Number Theory over the last decades. Besides, given an elliptic L-curve one
can construct a projective analogue of the previous Galois representation. In
this work we construct similar projective representations in the

an important role in the design, analysis and interpretation of clinical

external information in clinical trials with binary outcomes, perhaps due to
the perception that binary outcomes can be treated as normally-distributed
outcomes by using normal approximations. In this paper we show that these two
types of clinical trials could behave differently, and that special care is
needed for the analysis of clinical trials with binary outcomes. In particular,
we first examine a simple but commonly used univariate Bayesian approach and
observe a technical flaw. We then study the full Bayesian approach using
different beta priors and a new frequentist approach based on the notion of
confidence distribution (CD). These approaches are illustrated and compared
using data from clinical studies and simulations. The full Bayesian approach is
theoretically sound, but surprisingly, under skewed prior distributions, the
estimate derived from the marginal posterior distribution may not fall between
those from the marginal prior and the likelihood of clinical trial data. This
counterintuitive phenomenon, which we call the ""discrepant posterior
phenomenon,"" does not occur in the CD approach. The CD approach is also
computationally simpler and can be applied directly to any prior distribution,
symmetric or skewed.

the different stellar tracers and focus our attention on the SFR based on the
three classical Cepheids recently discovered in the Galactic Center. We also
discuss stellar populations in field and cluster stars and present some
preliminary results based on near-infrared photometry of a field centered on
the young massive cluster Arches. We also provide a new estimate of the true
distance modulus to the Galactic Center and we found
14.49$\pm$0.02(standard)$\pm$0.10(systematic) mag (7.91$\pm0.08\pm0.40$ kpc).
Current estimate agrees quite well with similar photometric and kinematic
distance determinations available in the literature. We also discuss the
metallicity gradient of the thin disk and the sharp change in the slope when
moving across the edge of the inner disk, the Galactic Bar and the Galactic
Center. The difference becomes even more compelling if we take into account
that metal abundances are based on young stellar tracers (classical Cepheids,
Red Supergiants, Luminous Blue Variables). Finally, we briefly outline the

  Much of the sparse recovery or compressive sensing literature has focused on
the case of either $p = 0$ or $p = \Omega(1)$. We initiate the study of this
problem for the entire range of failure probability. Our two main results are
as follows: \begin{enumerate} \item We prove a lower bound on $m$, the number
measurements, of $\Omega(k\log(n/k)+\log(1/p))$ for $2^{-\Theta(N)}\le p <1$.
Cohen, Dahmen, and DeVore \cite{CDD2007:NearOptimall2l2} prove that this bound
is tight. \item We prove nearly matching upper bounds for \textit{sub-linear}

  Surrogate of Rank","accepted by ECML PKDD2013",,,,"stat.ML math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  Rank minimization has attracted a lot of attention due to its robustness in
data recovery. To overcome the computational difficulty, rank is often replaced
with nuclear norm. For several rank minimization problems, such a replacement
has been theoretically proven to be valid, i.e., the solution to nuclear norm
minimization problem is also the solution to rank minimization problem.
Although it is easy to believe that such a replacement may not always be valid,
no concrete example has ever been found. We argue that such a validity checking
cannot be done by numerical computation and show, by analyzing the noiseless
latent low rank representation (LatLRR) model, that even for very simple rank
minimization problems the validity may still break down. As a by-product, we
find that the solution to the nuclear norm minimization formulation of LatLRR
is non-unique. Hence the results of LatLRR reported in the literature may be
questionable.

be small in one or several of its dimensions. In order to preserve the
nonlinear nature of the obstruction, asymptotic expansions in the low-Froude or
low-Bond number limits can be derived, but here, the solutions are waveless to
every order. This is because the waves are in fact, exponentially small, and
thus beyond-all-orders of regular asymptotics; their formation is a consequence
of the divergence of the asymptotic series and the associated Stokes
Phenomenon.
  In Part 1, we showed how exponential asymptotics could be used to study the

extend the analysis to the nonlinear problem, thus allowing the full geometry
to be considered at leading order. When applied to the classic problem of flow
over a step, our analysis reveals the existence of six classes of
gravity-capillary waves, from which two share a connection with the usual

due to the availability of multiple singularities in the geometry, coupled with
the interplay of gravitational and cohesive effects.

criterion for partial CSI, we propose a two-phase low-complexity MLSE
algorithm, in which the first phase performs the conventional MLSE algorithm in

apply the method to the calculation of the Cu L2,3 edges in fcc copper and
cuprite (Cu2O), and to the S L2,3 edges in molybdenite (2H-MoS2). The role of
core-hole effects, modeled in a supercell approach, as well as the
decomposition of the spectrum into different angular momentum channels are
studied in detail. In copper we find that the best agreement with experimental
data is obtained when core-hole effects are neglected. On the contrary,
core-hole effects need to be included both in Cu2O and 2H-MoS2. Finally we show
that a non-negligible component of S L2,3 edges in 2H-MoS2 involves transition
to states with s character at all energy scales. The inclusion of this angular
momentum channel is mandatory to correctly describe the angular dependence of
the measured spectra. We believe that transitions to s character states are

finite-range Gogny force in the particle-particle channel. The influence of the
pairing strength on the behaviors of dineutron correlations is investigated. It
is found that the neutron pairing gaps at the Fermi surface from three adopted
Gogny interactions are smaller at low densities than the one from the bare
nucleon-nucleon interaction Bonn-B potential. From the normal (anomalous)
density distribution functions and the density correlation function, it is
confirmed that a true dineutron BEC state does not appear in nuclear matter. In
the cases of the Gogny interactions, the most BEC-like state may appear when
the neutron Fermi momentum $k_{Fn}\thicksim0.3 \rm{fm^{-1}}$. Moreover, based
on the newly developed criterion for several characteristic quantities within
the relativistic framework, the BCS-BEC crossover is supposed to realize in a
revised density region with $k_{Fn}\in[0.15,0.63] \rm{fm^{-1}}$ in nuclear
matter.

However, we argue that a large separation of typical decay times is necessary
for nonconvex solutions to occur, making concave transients extremely
short-lived with respect to the main relaxation modes. We describe a general
method based on the Fisher information matrix to discriminate between
generators that do and don't admit nonconvex solutions. While initial
conditions leading to concave transients are shown to be extremely fine-tuned,
by our method we are able to select nonconvex initial conditions that are
arbitrarily close to the steady state. Convexity does occur when the system is
close to satisfy detailed balance, or more generally when certain normality
conditions of the decay modes are satisfied. Our results circumscribe the range
of validity of a conjecture proposed by Maes et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 107,

theory, some peculiar properties of waves propagating in compressible materials

at the Large Binocular Telescope with the IR spectrograph LUCIFER, allows us to
infer the main stellar parameters (visual extinction, accretion luminosity,
mass accretion and ejection rates), and model the inner disc, jet, and wind.
The NIR spectrum displays several strong emission lines associated with
accretion/ejection activity and circumstellar environment. Our analysis shows
that the brightness of PV Cep is fading, as well as the mass accretion rate
(2x10^-7 Msun/yr^-1 in 2012 vs ~5x10^-6 Msun/yr^-1 in 2004), which is more than
one order of magnitude lower than in the outburst phase. Among the several
emission lines, only the [FeII] intensity increased after the outburst. The
observed [FeII] emission delineates blue- and red-shifted lobes, both with
high- and low-velocity components, which trace an asymmetric jet and wind,
respectively. The observed emission in the jet has a dynamical age of ~8 years,
indicating that it was produced during the last outburst. The mass ejection
rate in both lobes is 1.5x10^-7 Msun/yr^-1, approximately matching the high
accretion rate observed during and immediately after the outburst . The
observed jet/outflow asymmetries are consistent with an inhomogeneous medium.
Our modelling of the CO emission hints at a small-scale gaseous disc ring,
extending from ~0.2-0.4 AU to ~3 AU from the source, with an inner temperature
of ~3000 K. Our HI lines modelling indicates that most of the observed emission

context-sensitive even in the presence of recursion. Many methods of
interprocedural analysis sacrifice precision for scalability while some are
precise but limited to only a certain class of problems.
  Soot currently supports interprocedural analysis of Java programs using graph
reachability. However, this approach is restricted to IFDS/IDE problems, and is
not suitable for general data flow frameworks such as heap reference analysis
and points-to analysis which have non-distributive flow functions.
  We describe a general-purpose interprocedural analysis framework for Soot
using data flow values for context-sensitivity. This framework is not
restricted to problems with distributive flow functions, although the lattice
must be finite. It combines the key ideas of the tabulation method of the
functional approach and the technique of value-based termination of call string
construction.
  The efficiency and precision of interprocedural analyses is heavily affected
by the precision of the underlying call graph. This is especially important for
object-oriented languages like Java where virtual method invocations cause an
explosion of spurious call edges if the call graph is constructed naively. We
have instantiated our framework with a flow and context-sensitive points-to
analysis in Soot, which enables the construction of call graphs that are far
more precise than those constructed by Soot's SPARK engine.

signal of interest lies in a single vector space. In the context of the
recently developed theory of compressive sensing (CS), it is often assumed that
the signal of interest is sparse in an orthonormal basis. However, in many
practical applications, this requirement may be too restrictive. A
generalization of the standard sparsity assumption is that the signal lies in a
union of subspaces. Recovery of such signals from a small number of samples has
been studied recently in several works. Here, we consider the problem of
subspace recovery in which our goal is to identify the subspace (from the
union) in which the signal lies using a small number of samples, in the
presence of noise. More specifically, we derive performance bounds and
conditions under which reliable subspace recovery is guaranteed using maximum
likelihood (ML) estimation. We begin by treating general unions and then obtain
the results for the special case in which the subspaces have structure leading
to block sparsity. In our analysis, we treat both general sampling operators
and random sampling matrices. With general unions, we show that under certain
conditions, the number of measurements required for reliable subspace recovery
in the presence of noise via ML is less than that implied using the restricted
isometry property which guarantees signal recovery. In the special case of
block sparse signals, we quantify the gain achievable over standard sparsity in
subspace recovery. Our results also strengthen existing results on sparse
support recovery in the presence of noise under the standard sparsity model.

Still, the way in which the crack selects its velocity in response to this

mechanisms, we experimentally studied damage and dissipation processes that
develop during the dynamic failure of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA),
classically considered as the archetype of brittle amorphous materials. We
evidenced a well-defined critical velocity along which failure switches from
nominally-brittle to quasi-brittle, where crack propagation goes hand in hand
with the nucleation and growth of microcracks. Via post-mortem analysis of the
fracture surfaces, we were able to reconstruct the complete spatiotemporal
microcracking dynamics with micrometer/nanosecond resolution. We demonstrated
that the true local propagation speed of individual crack fronts is limited to
a fairly low value, which can be much smaller than the apparent speed measured
at the continuum-level scale. By coalescing with the main front, microcracks
boost the macroscale velocity through an acceleration factor of geometrical
origin. We discuss the key role of damage-related internal variables in the
selection of macroscale fracture dynamics.

form a proper subclass of the regular infinite lambda-terms. In this paper we
establish these characterizations only for expressibility in lambda_{mu}, the

(ii): T is strongly regular; (iii): T is regular, and it only has finite

  We define regularity and strong regularity for infinite lambda-terms as two
different generalizations of regularity for infinite first-order terms: as the
existence of only finitely many subterms that are defined as the reducts of two
rewrite relations for decomposing lambda-terms. These rewrite relations act on
infinite lambda-terms furnished with a marked prefix of abstractions for
collecting decomposed lambda-abstractions and keeping the terms closed under
decomposition. They differ in how vacuous abstractions in the prefix are
removed.

$G$, and apply it to state a general conjecture on test functions for Shimura
varieties due to the author and R. Kottwitz. This conjecture provides a
framework by which one might pursue the Langlands-Kottwitz method in a very
general situation: not necessarily PEL Shimura varieties with arbitrary level
structure at $p$. We give a concrete reinterpretation of the test function
conjecture in the context of parahoric level structure. We also use the stable
Bernstein center to formulate some of the transfer conjectures (the
""fundamental lemmas"") that would be needed if one attempts to use the test
function conjecture to express the local Hasse-Weil zeta function of a Shimura
variety in terms of automorphic $L$-functions.

As a tool towards this goal we propose a thermodynamical approach to quantum
mechanics, based on Onsager's classical theory of irreversible processes and on
Prigogine's nonunitary transformation theory. An entropy operator replaces the
Hamiltonian as the generator of evolution. The canonically conjugate variable
corresponding to the entropy is a dimensionless evolution parameter. Contrary
to the Hamiltonian, the entropy operator is not a conserved Noether charge. Our
construction succeeds in implementing gravitationally-induced irreversibility
in the quantum theory.

problems. Its evaluation inside continuous media from Newton's law is known to
be challenging because of the diverging kernel 1/|r-r'|. This difficulty is
generally treated with avoidance techniques (e.g. multipole expansions,
softening length) themselves not without drawbacks. In this article, we present
a new path that basically fixes the point-mass singularity problem in systems
with, at least, two dimensions. It consists of recasting the gravitational
potential in an equivalent integro-differential form, namely the
cross-derivative of a ""hyperpotential"" (i.e., an auxiliary scalar function). In
contrast with the potential, the hyperpotential is the convolution of the mass
density with a finite amplitude kernel. We show that closed-form expressions
for this new kernel can be directly deduced from the potential of homogeneous
sheets. We then give a few formulae appropriate to the Cartesian, cylindrical
and spherical coordinate systems, including axial symmetry. The method is
essentially not limited, either on the geometry of the source or on the
distribution, and its implementation is straightforward. Several tests based
upon simple quadrature/differentiation schemes are presented (the homogeneous
rectangular sheet, cuboid and disk, the Maclaurin disk and a truncated
Lane-Emden solution). Compared with a direct summation, the extra computational
cost is low and the gain is real: no truncated series, no free parameter, and a
relative accuracy better than 1% for typically 16 nodes per spatial direction
using the most basic numerical schemes.

continuous, resulting in phase separation in density space. In contrast, the

be second or first order depending on whether fermions are allowed to hop

polarized parallel to the surfaces in this case. If the surfaces are mostly
hydrophilic, then the molecules are polarized against the surfaces, and the
interaction becomes repulsive, but at a short-range (\lambda\sim0.2\, nm).
Finally, we predict there exists an intermediate regime, where the surfaces
fail to order the water molecules, the interaction becomes much weaker,

variation of the magnetization as a function of an applied electric field, in
extrinsic multiferroic hybrids is a key prerequisite for the development of
future spintronic devices. We present a detailed study of the strain-mediated
converse magnetoelectric effect in ferrimagnetic Fe3O4 thin films on
ferroelectric BaTiO3 substrates at room temperature. The experimental results
are in excellent agreement with numerical simulation based on a two-region
model. This demonstrates that the electric field induced changes of the
magnetic state in the Fe3O4 thin film can be well described by the presence of
two different ferroelastic domains in the BaTiO3 substrate, resulting in two
differently strained regions in the Fe3O4 film with different magnetic
properties. The two-region model allows to predict the converse magnetoelectric
effects in multiferroic hybrid structures consisting of ferromagnetic thin
films on ferroelastic substrates.

affects the way they interact with impurities. Signatures of the relativistic
behavior have been observed recently in scanning tunneling measurements on
individual impurities, but the conductance measurements in this regime are
typically dominated by electron and hole puddles. Here we present measurements
of quantum interference noise and magnetoresistance in graphene pn junctions.
Unlike the conductance, the quantum interference noise can provide access to
the scattering at the Dirac point:it is sensitive to the motion of a single
impurity, it depends strongly on the fundamental symmetries that describe the
system and it is determined by the phase-coherent phenomena which are not
necessarily obscured by the puddles. The temperature and the carrier density
dependence of resistance fluctuations and magnetoresistance in graphene p-n
junctions at low temperatures suggest that the noise is dominated by the
quantum interference due to scattering on impurities and that the noise minimum
could be used to determine the point where the average carrier density is zero.
At larger carrier densities, the amplitude of the noise depends strongly on the
sign of the impurity charge, reflecting the fact that the electrons and the
holes are scattered by the impurity potential in an asymmetric manner.

  geography",,,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The dispersal stages of organisms with sessile adults must be able to select
habitats with suitable conditions for establishment and survival, and must also
be able to reach those locations. For marine planktonic larvae, movement due to
currents is often orders of magnitude greater than movement due to swimming
behaviour, so transport is largely passive.
  Current patterns are determined by the interaction of geography with tidal
forces, modified by meteorological conditions. These linkages impose an
area-specific focus to connectivity studies. Yet, how geographical features and
meteorological forcing combine to produce specific current patterns and
resultant connectivity among populations remains unclear.
  In this study, we followed tracks of generic particles driven by modelled
hydrodynamic currents to investigate how connectivity between evenly spaced
habitat sites varies in relation to coastal topography. Larvae released from
regions of high current velocity, open coastline and low local habitat
availability travelled furthest but were less likely to disperse successfully.
Extensive natal habitat in the vicinity of a site generally had a positive
impact on the number of larvae arriving, as did low current velocities.
However, relationships between numbers of arriving larvae and local
geographical indices were complex, particularly at longer larval durations.
  Local geography alone explained up to 50% of the variance in success of
larvae released and around 10% of the variation in the number of larvae
arriving at each site, but coastline properties fall short of predicting
dispersal measures for particular locations. The study shows that
meteorological variation and broad scale current patterns interact strongly
with local geography to determine connectivity in coastal areas.

plasmonic tunable low-pass filters operating in the THz band. The proposed
structure is composed of a graphene strip transferred onto a dielectric and a
set of polysilicon DC gating pads located beneath it. This structure implements
a stepped impedance low-pass filter for the propagating surface plasmons by
adequately controlling the guiding properties of each strip section through
graphene's field effect. A synthesis procedure is presented to design filters
with desired specifications in terms of cut-off frequency, in-band performance,
and rejection characteristics. The electromagnetic modeling of the structure is
efficiently performed by combining an electrostatic scaling law to compute the
guiding features of each strip section with a transmission line and
transfer-matrix framework, approach further validated via full wave
simulations. The performance of the proposed filters is evaluated in practical
scenarios, taking into account the presence of the gating bias and the
influence of graphene's losses. These results, together with the high
miniaturization associated with plasmonic propagation, are very promising for
the future use and integration of the proposed filters with other graphene and
silicon-based elements in innovative THz communication systems.

matching, to obtain higher rates of approximation error decay. The parameters
of the approximation are easy to fix. The computational complexity of random
sampling of the approximating distribution in many cases is of the same order
as normal approximation. Error bounds in terms of total variance distance are
derived. Both the univariate and the multivariate cases of the approximation

of the radius ratio {\eta} on the system response. Numerical simulations reach
Reynolds numbers of up to Re_i=9.5 x 10^3 and Re_o=5x10^3, corresponding to
Taylor numbers of up to Ta=10^8 for four different radius ratios {\eta}=r_i/r_o
between 0.5 and 0.909. The experiments, performed in the Twente Turbulent
Taylor-Couette (T^3C) setup, reach Reynolds numbers of up to Re_i=2x10^6$ and
Re_o=1.5x10^6, corresponding to Ta=5x10^{12} for {\eta}=0.714-0.909. Effective
scaling laws for the torque J^{\omega}(Ta) are found, which for sufficiently
large driving Ta are independent of the radius ratio {\eta}. As previously
reported for {\eta}=0.714, optimum transport at a non-zero Rossby number
Ro=r_i|{\omega}_i-{\omega}_o|/[2(r_o-r_i){\omega}_o] is found in both
experiments and numerics. Ro_opt is found to depend on the radius ratio and the
driving of the system. At a driving in the range between {Ta\sim3\cdot10^8} and
{Ta\sim10^{10}}, Ro_opt saturates to an asymptotic {\eta}-dependent value.
Theoretical predictions for the asymptotic value of Ro_{opt} are compared to
the experimental results, and found to differ notably. Furthermore, the local
angular velocity profiles from experiments and numerics are compared, and a
link between a flat bulk profile and optimum transport for all radius ratios is
reported.

geometric complexity theory (GCT), including: the partial derivatives technique
(Nisan-Wigderson), the results of Razborov and Smolensky on $AC^0[p]$,
multilinear formula and circuit size lower bounds (Raz et al.), the degree
bound (Strassen, Baur-Strassen), the connected components technique (Ben-Or),

fit into GCT), the chasms at depth 3 and 4 (Gupta-Kayal-Kamath-Saptharishi;
Agrawal-Vinay; Koiran), matrix rigidity (Valiant) and others. That is, the
original proofs, with what is often just a little extra work, already provide
representation-theoretic obstructions in the sense of GCT for their respective
lower bounds. This enables us to expose a new viewpoint on GCT, whereby it is a
natural unification and broad generalization of known results. It also shows
that the framework of GCT is at least as powerful as known methods, and gives
many new proofs-of-concept that GCT can indeed provide significant asymptotic
lower bounds. This new viewpoint also opens up the possibility of fruitful
two-way interactions between previous results and the new methods of GCT; we
provide several concrete suggestions of such interactions. For example, the
representation-theoretic viewpoint of GCT naturally provides new properties to
consider in the search for new lower bounds.

Camenzind's matter current, namely that the solution space for radiation in
fact belongs to that of the vacuum solution of SKY equation. We also found that
his matter current does not obey the conservation condition suggested by

computer science, physics, biology, artificial intelligence, economics and the
humanities point to the importance of the notion for understanding the world

between the computable world and the incomputable formed a central theme in
Turing's work - from the early establishment of the standard model of the
stored program computer, to the late work on emergence of form in nature, and
the first approaches to understanding and simulating human intelligence.
Turing's thinking was remarkably prescient, and his legacy still impacts on
much of our work. The incomputable may turn out to be a specially important
part of the legacy, with consequences that Alan Turing himself could not have

  arXiv:1302.3043",,,,"math.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We give some general theorems on free algebras of varieties of Boolean
algebras with operators; a hitherto new result is obtained for Pinter's
substitution algebras. For n\geq 3, and m>1, there is a generating set of the
free algebra freely generated by m elements, which is not a free set of
generators.

representable, the term algebra is in \RCA_n\cap \Nr_n\CA_{n+k}, but the
complex algebra is not representable. Call an atom structure neat if there is
an atomic algebra \A, such that \At\A=\alpha, \A\in \Nr_n\CA_{\omega} and for
every algebra $\B$ based on this atom structure there exists k\in \omega$,
k\geq 1, such that \B\in \Nr_n\CA_{n+k}.
  (2) Let k\leq \omega. Call an atom structure \alpha k complete, if there
exists \A such that \At\A=\alpha and \A\in S_c\Nr_n\CA_{n+k}.
  (3) Let k\leq \omega. Call an atom structure $\alpha$ k neat if there exists
\A such that \At\A=\alpha, and \A\in \Nr_n\CA_{n+k}.
  (4) Let K\subseteq \CA_n, and \L be an extension of first order logic. We say
that \K is well behaved w.r.t to \L, if for any \A\in \K, A atomic, and for any
any atom structure \beta such that \At\A is elementary equivalent to \beta, for
any \B, \At\B=\beta, then B\in K.
  We investigate the existence of such structures, and the interconnections. We
also present several K's and L's as in the second definition. All our results
extend to Pinter's algebras and polyadic algebras with and without equality.

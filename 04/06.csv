DRep_n(A) of the classical representation scheme Rep_n(A) for an associative
k-algebra A. In [BKR], we have constructed canonical trace maps Tr_n(A): HC(A)
-> H[DRep_n(A)]^GL extending the usual characters of representations to higher
cyclic homology. This raises a question whether a well known theorem of Procesi
[P] holds in the derived setting: namely, is the algebra homomorphism
Sym[Tr_n(A)]: Sym[HC(A)] -> H[DRep_n(A)]^GL defined by Tr_n(A) surjective ? In
the present paper, we answer this question for augmented algebras. Given such
an algebra, we construct a canonical dense DG subalgebra DRep_\infty(A)^Tr of
the topological DG algebra DRep_\infty(A)^{GL_\infty}. It turns out that on
passing to the inverse limit (as n -> \infty), the family of maps Sym[Tr_n(A)]
""stabilizes"" to an isomorphism Sym[\bar{HC}(A)] = H[DRep_\infty(A)^Tr]. The
derived version of Procesi's theorem does therefore hold in the limit. However,
for a fixed (finite) n, there exist homological obstructions to the
surjectivity of Sym[Tr_n(A)], and we show on simple examples that these
obstructions do not vanish in general. We compare our result with the classical
theorem of Loday-Quillen and Tsygan on stable homology of matrix Lie algebras.
We show that the relative Chevalley-Eilenberg complex C(gl_\infty(A),
gl_\infty(k); k) equipped with the natural coalgebra structure is Koszul dual
to the DG algebra DRep_\infty(A)^Tr. We also extend our main results to
bigraded DG algebras, in which case we show that DRep_{\infty}(A)^Tr =
DRep_{\infty}(A)^GL_{\infty}. As an application, we compute the (bigraded)
Euler characteristics of DRep_\infty(A)^GL_{\infty} and \bar{HC}(A) and derive
some interesting combinatorial identities.

It has been proposed that the temporal coincidence of a gamma-ray
burst (GRB) and a type Ib/c supernova (SN) can be explained with the concept of
induced gravitational collapse (IGC), induced by the matter ejected from an SN
Ib/c accreting onto a neutron star (NS). The NS is expected to reach the
critical mass necessary for it to collapse to a black hole (BH) and emit a GRB.
We found a standard luminosity light curve behavior in the late-time X-ray
emission of this subclass of GRBs. Aims. We test if this standard behavior in
the luminosity found in this subclass of GRBs can become a redshift estimator
of these sources. Methods. We selected a sample of GRBs that belong to this
subclass of IGC GRBs associated to an SN (IGC GRB-SN sources). These sources
have an isotropic energy $E_{iso} > 10^{52}$ erg and their cosmological
redshifts are in the range of $z = 0.49-1.261$. We focused on the corresponding
X-ray luminosity light curves. Results. We find that all GRBs of the sample
with measured redshift present a standard luminosity late-time light curve in
the $0.3-10$ keV rest-frame energy range. We used these results to estimate the
GRB redshift of the sample without a measured redshift and found results
consistent with other possible redshift indicators. Conclusions. The standard
late-time X-ray luminosity light curve of all GRBs of the sample shows a common
physical mechanism in this particular phase of the X-ray emission, possibly
related to the creation of the NS from the SN process. This scaling law
moreover represents strong evidence of very low or even absent beaming in this
late phase of the X-ray afterglow emission process. This could be a fundamental
tool for estimating the redshift of GRBs that belong to this subclass of
events. We are currently expanding this subclass of GRBs to further verify the
universal validity of this new redshift estimation method.

flat spectral indices ($\alpha<0.5$). There are several explanations of the
flat radio spectra of SNRs in the present literature. The most of models
involve a significant contribution of the second-order Fermi mechanism but some
of them also discuss high compressions (>4), contribution of secondary
electrons left over from the decay of charged pions, as well as the possibility
of thermal contamination. In the case of expansion in high density environment,
intrinsic thermal bremsstrahlung could theoretically shape the radio spectrum
of an SNR and also account for observable curved -- ""concave up"" radio spectra
of some Galactic SNRs. This model could also shed a light on the question of
flat spectral indices determined in some Galactic SNRs. On the other hand,
present knowledge of the radio continuum spectra (integrated flux densities at
different frequencies) of SNRs prevent definite conclusions about the
significance of proposed models so the question on flat spectral indices still
remains open. New observations, especially at high radio continuum frequencies,
are expected to solve these questions in the near future. Finally, as there is
a significant connection between the majority of Galactic SNRs with flat
integrated radio spectrum and their detection in $\gamma$-rays as well as
detection of radiative recombination continua in their X-ray spectra, the
analysis of high energy properties of these SNRs is very important.

Tidal stream generators are one of the key technologies for extracting and
harnessing this potential. In order to extract an economically useful amount of
power, hundreds of tidal turbines must typically be deployed in an array. This
naturally leads to the question of how these turbines should be configured to
extract the maximum possible power: the positioning and the individual tuning
of the turbines could significantly influence the extracted power, and hence is
of major economic interest. However, manual optimisation is difficult due to
legal site constraints, nonlinear interactions of the turbine wakes, and the
cubic dependence of the power on the flow speed. The novel contribution of this
paper is the formulation of this problem as an optimisation problem constrained
by a physical model, which is then solved using an efficient gradient-based
optimisation algorithm. In each optimisation iteration, a two-dimensional
finite element shallow water model predicts the flow and the performance of the
current array configuration. The gradient of the power extracted with respect
to the turbine positions and their tuning parameters is then computed in a
fraction of the time taken for a flow solution by solving the associated
adjoint equations. These equations propagate causality backwards through the
computation, from the power extracted back to the turbine positions and the
tuning parameters. This yields the gradient at a cost almost independent of the
number of turbines, which is crucial for any practical application. The utility
of the approach is demonstrated by optimising turbine arrays in four idealised
scenarios and a more realistic case with up to 256 turbines in the Inner Sound

nonlocal gravity is dissipative is demonstrated in this paper within certain
approximation schemes. The gravitational memory drag leads to the decay of the
amplitude of gravitational waves given by the exponential damping factor exp
(-t/\tau), where $\tau$ depends on the kernel of nonlocal gravity. The damping
time $\tau$ is estimated for gravitational waves of current observational

with; a hollow tube of ice --- a brinicle --- growing downwards around the
plume of descending brine. We show that brinicles can be understood as a form
of the self-assembled tubular precipitation structures termed chemical gardens,
plant-like structures formed on placing together a soluble metal salt, often in
the form of a seed crystal, and an aqueous solution of one of many anions,
often silicate. On one hand, in the case of classical chemical gardens, an
osmotic pressure difference across a semipermeable precipitation membrane that
filters solutions by rejecting the solute leads to an inflow of water and to
its rupture. The internal solution, generally being lighter than the external
solution, flows up through the break, and as it does so a tube grows upwards by
precipitation around the jet of internal solution. Such chemical-garden tubes
can grow to many centimetres in length. In the case of brinicles, on the other
hand, in floating sea ice we have porous ice in a mushy layer that filters out
water, by freezing it, and allows concentrated brine through. Again there is an
osmotic pressure difference leading to a continuing ingress of sea water in a
siphon pump mechanism that is sustained as long as the ice continues to freeze.
Since the brine that is pumped out is denser than the sea water, and descends
rather rises, a brinicle is a downwards growing tube of ice; an inverse
chemical garden.

promising sources for ground-based gravitational wave detectors. Gravitational
radiation encodes rich information about source physics; thus parameter
estimation and model selection are crucial analysis steps for any detection
candidate events. Detailed models of the anticipated waveforms enable inference
on several parameters, such as component masses, spins, sky location and
distance that are essential for new astrophysical studies of these sources.
However, accurate measurements of these parameters and discrimination of models
describing the underlying physics are complicated by artifacts in the data,
uncertainties in the waveform models and in the calibration of the detectors.
Here we report such measurements on a selection of simulated signals added
either in hardware or software to the data collected by the two LIGO
instruments and the Virgo detector during their most recent joint science run,
including a ""blind injection"" where the signal was not initially revealed to
the collaboration. We exemplify the ability to extract information about the
source physics on signals that cover the neutron star and black hole parameter
space over the individual mass range 1 Msun - 25 Msun and the full range of
spin parameters. The cases reported in this study provide a snap-shot of the
status of parameter estimation in preparation for the operation of advanced
detectors.

use the discrete velocity (or discrete ordinate) approximation. In this
approach, the kinetic equation is approximated with a global velocity grid. The
grid must be large and fine enough to capture all the distribution functions,
which is very expensive for high speed flows (like in hypersonic aerodynamics).
In this article, we propose to use instead different velocity grids that are
local in time and space: these grids dynamically adapt to the width of the
distribution functions. The advantages and drawbacks of the method are
illustrated in several 1D test cases.

the soft x-ray range (photon energy lower than 1 keV). However, they do not
permit to obtain high-resolution spectra like natural or synthetic crystals.
Thus, multilayers cannot resolve interferences between close x-ray lines. It
has been shown and demonstrated experimentally that patterning a grating
profile within a multilayer structure leads to a diffractive optics with
improved resolving power. We illustrate the use of a Mo/B4C multilayer grating
in the Fe L and C K spectral ranges, around 700 eV and 280 eV respectively.
First, in the Fe L range, the improved spectral resolution enables us to
distinguish the Fe L\alpha and L\beta emissions (separated by 13 eV). In
addition, using a sample made of a mix of LiF and an iron ore, we show that it
is possible to easily resolve the F K and Fe L emissions. These examples
demonstrate that an improved x-ray analysis can be obtained with multilayer
gratings when there is the need to study samples having elements giving rise to
close emission lines. Second, in the C K range, by comparing C K\alpha spectra
from B4C and cellulose, we show that the shape of the emission band is
sensitive to the chemical state of the carbon atom.

stick-breaking Dirichlet process mixture model, with concentration parameter
alpha. This paper introduces a Gibbs sampling algorithm that combines the slice
sampling approach of Walker (2007) and the retrospective sampling approach of
Papaspiliopoulos and Roberts (2008). Our general algorithm is implemented as
efficient open source C++ software, available as an R package, and is based on
a blocking strategy similar to that suggested by Papaspiliopoulos (2008) and
implemented by Yau et al (2011).
  We discuss the difficulties of achieving good mixing in MCMC samplers of this
nature and investigate sensitivity to initialisation. We additionally consider
the challenges when an additional layer of hierarchy is added such that joint
inference is to be made on alpha. We introduce a new label switching move and
compute the marginal model posterior to help to surmount these difficulties.
Our work is illustrated using a profile regression (Molitor et al, 2010)

charged, as shown by the considerable lightning activity measured by the UK Met
Office's low-frequency lightning detection network. Previous measurements of
volcanic plumes have shown that ash particles are electrically charged up to
hundreds of km away from the vent, which indicates that the ash continues to
charge in the plume [Harrison et al., Env. Res. Lett. 5 024004 (2010),
Hatakeyama J. Met. Soc. Japan 27 372 (1949)]. In this paper we study
triboelectric charging of different size fractions of a sample of volcanic ash
experimentally. Consistently with previous work, we find that the particle size
distribution is a determining factor in the charging. Specifically, our
laboratory experiments demonstrate that the normalised span of the particle
size distribution plays an important role in the magnitude of charging
generated. The influence of the normalised span on plume charging suggests that
all ash plumes are likely to be charged, with implications for remote sensing
and plume lifetime through scavenging effects.

mass $M_h \approx 126$ GeV is that the scale of supersymmetry-breaking in the
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) might be rather high, $M_S \gg
M_Z$. In this paper, we consider the high $M_S$ regime and study the spectrum
of the extended Higgs sector of the MSSM, including the LHC constraints on the
mass and the rates of the observed light $h$ state. In particular, we show that
in a simplified model that approximates the important radiative corrections,
the unknown scale $M_S$ (and some other leading SUSY parameters) can be traded
against the measured value of $M_h$. One would be then essentially left with
only two free parameters to describe the Higgs sector, tan$\beta$ and the
pseudoscalar Higgs mass $M_A$, even at higher orders. The main phenomenological
consequence of these high $M_S$ values is to reopen the low tan$\beta$ region,
tan$\beta \lsim 3-5$, which was for a long time buried under the LEP constraint
on the lightest $h$ mass when a low SUSY scale was assumed. We show that, in
this case, the heavier MSSM neutral $H/A$ and charged $H^\pm$ states can be
searched for in a variety of interesting final states such as decays into gauge
and lighter Higgs bosons (in pairs on in mixed states) and decays into heavy
top quarks. Examples of sensitivity on the $[tan\beta, M_A]$ parameter space at

indicated a rise in the cosmic-ray positron fraction above 10 GeV, a feature
which is impossible to mimic under the paradigm of secondary positron
production with self-consistent Galactic cosmic-ray propagation models. A
leading explanation for the rising positron fraction is an additional source of
electron-positron pairs, for example one or more mature, energetic, and
relatively nearby pulsars. We point out that any one of two well-known nearby
pulsars, Geminga and Monogem, can satisfactorily provide enough positrons to
reproduce AMS-02 observations. A smoking-gun signature of this scenario is an
anisotropy in the arrival direction of the cosmic-ray electrons and positrons,
which may be detectable by existing, or future, telescopes. The predicted
anisotropy level is, at present, consistent with limits from Fermi-LAT and
AMS-02. We argue that the large collecting area of Atmospheric Cherenkov
Telescopes (ACTs) makes them optimal tools for detecting such an anisotropy.
Specifically, we show that much of the proton and gamma-ray background, which
affects measurements of the cosmic-ray electron-positron spectrum with ACTs,
may be controlled in the search for anisotropies. We conclude that observations
using archival ACT data could already constrain or substantiate the pulsar

there polynomials $f,g\in F[X]$, with $f$ monic of degree $n$, such that $A$ is
similar to $g(C_f)$, where $C_f$ is the companion matrix of $f$? For infinite
fields the answer is easily seen to positive, so we concentrate on finite
fields. In this case we give an affirmative answer, provided $|F|\geq n-2$.
Moreover, for any finite field $F$, with $|F|=m$, we construct a matrix $A\in
M_{m+3}(F)$ that is not similar to any matrix of the form $g(C_f)$.
  Of use above, but also of independent interest, is a constructive procedure
to determine the similarity type of any given matrix $g(C_f)$ purely in terms
of $f$ and $g$, without resorting to polynomial roots in $F$ or in any
extension thereof. This, in turn, yields an algorithm that, given $g$ and the
invariant factors of any $A$, returns the elementary divisors of $g(A)$. It is
a rational procedure, as opposed to the classical method that uses the Jordan
decomposition of $A$ to find that of $g(A)$.
  Finally, extending prior results by the authors, we show that for an
integrally closed ring $R$ with field of fractions $F$ and companion matrices
$C,D$ the subalgebra $R< C,D>$ of $M_n(R)$ is a free $R$-module of rank

stabilization of the extra dimension through the Goldberger-Wise mechanism. We
explore the conditions under which the radion can remain light, and determine
the corrections to its couplings to Standard Model (SM) states when the effects
of stabilization are taken into account. We show that in the theories of
interest for electroweak symmetry breaking that have a holographic dual, the
presence of a light radion in the spectrum is not a robust prediction of the
framework, but is in fact associated with mild tuning. We find that corrections
to the form of the radion couplings to Standard Model particles arising from
effects associated with brane stabilization are suppressed by the square of the
ratio of the radion mass to the Kaluza-Klein scale. These corrections are small
in theories where the radion is light, and are generally subleading, except in
the case of couplings to the SM gluons and photon, when they can sometimes
dominate. The AdS/CFT correspondence relates the radion in Randall-Sundrum
models to the dilaton in theories where a strongly coupled conformal symmetry
is spontaneously broken. We show that the discrepancies in the literature
between the results for the dilaton and the radion can be traced to the
omission of self-interaction terms that would otherwise dominate the potential
for the Goldberger-Wise scalar near the infrared brane. In the dual picture,
this corresponds to neglecting the corrections to the scaling behavior of the
operator that breaks conformal symmetry when it grows large. With the inclusion
of these self-interaction terms, we find good agreement between the results on
the two sides of the correspondence.

problems in communication complexity. In this problem Alice and Bob hold sets
$S, T \subseteq [n]$, respectively, and the goal is to decide if $S \cap T =
\emptyset$. Reductions from set disjointness are a canonical way of proving
lower bounds in data stream algorithms, data structures, and distributed
computation. In these applications, often the set sizes $|S|$ and $|T|$ are
bounded by a value $k$ which is much smaller than $n$. This is referred to as
small set disjointness. A major restriction in the above applications is the
number of rounds that the protocol can make, which, e.g., translates to the
number of passes in streaming applications. A fundamental question is thus in
understanding the round complexity of the small set disjointness problem. For
an essentially equivalent problem, called OR-Equality, Brody et. al showed that
with $r$ rounds of communication, the randomized communication complexity is
$\Omega(k \ilog^r k)$, where$\ilog^r k$ denotes the $r$-th iterated logarithm
function. Unfortunately their result requires the error probability of the
protocol to be $1/k^{\Theta(1)}$. Since na\""ive amplification of the success
probability of a protocol from constant to $1-1/k^{\Theta(1)}$ blows up the
communication by a $\Theta(\log k)$ factor, this destroys their improvements
over the well-known lower bound of $\Omega(k)$ which holds for any number of
rounds. They pose it as an open question to achieve the same $\Omega(k \ilog^r
k)$ lower bound for protocols with constant error probability. We answer this
open question by showing that the $r$-round randomized communication complexity
of ${\sf OREQ}_{n,k}$, and thus also of small set disjointness, with {\it
constant error probability} is $\Omega(k \ilog^r k)$, asymptotically matching
known upper bounds for ${\sf OREQ}_{n,k}$ and small set disjointness.

individually optimized by maximum likelihood estimation. The R_h=ct Universe
fits the data with a reduced chi^2_dof=0.745 for a Hubble constant
H_0=63.2+/-2.5 km/s/Mpc, and H_0 is the sole parameter in this model. By
comparison, the optimal LCDM model, which has three free parameters (including
H_0=68.9+/-2.4 km/s/Mpc, Omega_m=0.32, and a dark-energy equation of state

chi^2_dof values, the AIC yields a likelihood of about 82 per cent that the
distance--redshift relation of the R_h=ct Universe is closer to the correct
cosmology, than is the case for LCDM. If the alternative BIC criterion is used,
the respective Bayesian posterior probabilities are 91.2 per cent (R_h=ct)

charge, this extremal spectrum is compatible with that of supergravity in AdS_5
x S^5. For finite central charge, we conjecture that the extremal spectrum is
that of N=4 SYM at an S-duality invariant value of the complexified gauge
coupling.

accessing many interesting processes which are otherwise kinematically

stable Minkowski (or dS) vacua where the complex structure moduli Z and the
dilaton are fixed supersymmetrically, while the fixing of the Kahler moduli at
a lower scale leads to spontaneous SUSY breaking. The minimum lies at
moderately large volumes of all geometric moduli, at a perturbative string

derivation of anisotropic compactifications which allow for gauge coupling
unification around 10^16 GeV. The gravitino mass can be anywhere between the
GUT and TeV scale depending on the fixing of the Z-moduli. In general, these
are fixed by turning on background fluxes, leading to a gravitino mass around
the GUT scale since the heterotic 3-form flux does not contain enough freedom
to tune W to small values. Moreover accommodating the observed value of the
cosmological constant (CC) is a challenge. Low-energy SUSY could instead be
obtained in particular situations where the gauge bundle is holomorphic only at
a point-like sub-locus of Z-moduli space, or where the number of Z-moduli is
small (like orbifold models), since in these cases one may fix all moduli
without turning on any quantised flux. However tuning the CC is even more of a
challenge in these cases. Another option is to focus on non-complex manifolds
since these allow for new geometric fluxes which can be used to tune W and the
CC, even if their moduli space is presently only poorly understood.

constrain its velocity relative to the main nucleus after leaving its sphere of

X-shaped tail feature were emitted in a direction opposite to the motion of the
asteroid and towards the south of its orbital plane. Derived emission
velocities of these primary fragments range between 0.02 and 0.3 m/s,
comparable to the ~0.08 m/s gravitational escape speed from the nucleus. Their
sizes are on the order of decimeters or larger. We obtain the best fits to our

issues by treating the VA as liquid and tradable. This allows us to use an
American option pricing framework to derive a so-called optimal initiation
region. Our main practical finding is that given current design parameters in
which volatility (asset allocation) is restricted to less than 20%, while
guaranteed payout rates (GPR) as well as bonus (roll-up) rates are less than
5%, GLWBs that are in-the-money should be turned on by the late 50s and
certainly the early 60s. The exception to the rule is when a non-constant GPR
is about to increase (soon) to a higher age band, in which case the optimal
policy is to wait until the new GPR is hit and then initiate immediately. Also,
to offer a different perspective, we invert the model and solve for the bonus
(roll-up) rate that is required to justify delaying initiation at any age. We
find that the required bonus is quite high and more than what is currently
promised by existing products. Our methodology and results should be of

this coupling, the Higgs-top associated production is reanalyzed. Thanks to the
strong destructive interference in the t-channel for standard model couplings,
this process can be very sensitive to both the magnitude and the sign of a
non-standard top-Higgs coupling. We project the sensitivity to anomalous
couplings to the integrated luminosity of 50 fb^{-1}, corresponding to the data

of a graph to compute some global structural feature of the graph. Such
algorithms use only local information available at nodes to determine local
aspects of the global structure, while also potentially using some randomness.
Recent research has shown that such algorithms show significant promise in
computing structures like large independent sets in graphs locally. Indeed the
promise led to a conjecture by Hatami, \Lovasz and Szegedy
\cite{HatamiLovaszSzegedy} that local algorithms may be able to compute maximum
independent sets in (sparse) random $d$-regular graphs. In this paper we refute
this conjecture and show that every independent set produced by local
algorithms is multiplicative factor $1/2+1/(2\sqrt{2})$ smaller than the
largest, asymptotically as $d\rightarrow\infty$.
  Our result is based on an important clustering phenomena predicted first in
the literature on spin glasses, and recently proved rigorously for a variety of
constraint satisfaction problems on random graphs. Such properties suggest that
the geometry of the solution space can be quite intricate. The specific
clustering property, that we prove and apply in this paper shows that typically
every two large independent sets in a random graph either have a significant
intersection, or have a nearly empty intersection. As a result, large
independent sets are clustered according to the proximity to each other. While
the clustering property was postulated earlier as an obstruction for the
success of local algorithms, such as for example, the Belief Propagation
algorithm, our result is the first one where the clustering property is used to
formally prove limits on local algorithms.

galaxy images that avoids noise-induced biases through a rigorous Bayesian
treatment of the measurement. The derived shear estimator disposes with the
assignment of ellipticities to individual galaxies that is typical of previous
approaches to galaxy lensing. Shear estimates from the mean of the Bayesian
posterior are unbiased in the limit of large number of background galaxies,
regardless of the noise level on individual galaxies. The Bayesian formalism
requires a prior describing the (noiseless) distribution of the target galaxy
population over some parameter space; this prior can be constructed from
low-noise images of a subsample of the target population, attainable from long
integrations of a fraction of the survey field. We find two ways to combine
this exact treatment of noise with rigorous treatment of the effects of the
instrumental point-spread function and sampling. The Bayesian model fitting
(BMF) method assigns a likelihood of the pixel data to galaxy models (e.g.
Sersic ellipses). The Bayesian Fourier domain (BFD) method compresses the pixel
data to a small set of weighted moments calculated after PSF correction in
Fourier space. A numerical test using a simplified model of a biased galaxy
measurement process demonstrates that the Bayesian formalism recovers applied
shears to $<1$ part in $10^3$ accuracy and provides accurate uncertainty
estimates. BFD is the first shear measurement algorithm that is model-free and
requires no approximations or ad hoc assumptions in correcting for the effects
of PSF, noise, or sampling on the galaxy images. These algorithms are good
candidates for attaining the part-per-thousand shear inference required for
hemisphere-scale weak gravitational lensing surveys. (abridged)

defined the average excess and average effect of a gene substitution. Finding
these notions to be somewhat opaque, some authors have recommended
reformulating Fisher's ideas in terms of covariance and regression, which are
classical concepts of statistics. We argue that Fisher intended his two
averages to express a distinction between correlation and causation. On this
view the average effect is a specific weighted average of the actual phenotypic
changes that result from physically changing the allelic states of homologous
genes. We show that the statistical and causal conceptions of the average
effect, perceived as inconsistent by Falconer, can be reconciled if certain
relationships between the genotype frequencies and non-additive residuals are
conserved. There are certain theory-internal considerations favoring Fisher's
original formulation in terms of causality; for example, the frequency-weighted
mean of the average effects equaling zero at each locus becomes a derivable
consequence rather than an arbitrary constraint. More broadly, Fisher's
distinction between correlation and causation is of critical importance to
gene-trait mapping studies and the foundations of evolutionary biology.

technology relates to the structure of the underlying network over which the
technology adoption spreads. We develop a model and show that the network of
agents adopting a particular technology may have characteristics that differ
significantly from the social network of agents over which the technology
spreads. For example, the network induced by a cascade may have a heavy-tailed
degree distribution even if the original network does not.
  This provides evidence that online social networks created by technology
adoption over an underlying social network may look fundamentally different
from social networks and indicates that using data from many online social
networks may mislead us if we try to use it to directly infer the structure of
social networks. Our results provide an alternate explanation for certain
properties repeatedly observed in data sets, for example: heavy-tailed degree
distribution, network densification, shrinking diameter, and network community
profile. These properties could be caused by a sort of `sampling bias' rather
than by attributes of the underlying social structure. By generating networks
using cascades over traditional network models that do not themselves contain
these properties, we can nevertheless reliably produce networks that contain
all these properties.
  An opportunity for interesting future research is developing new methods that
correctly infer underlying network structure from data about a network that is
generated via a cascade spread over the underlying network.

referred to as early superhumps, with amplitudes of about 0.08 mag. After the
rapid fading from the main outburst, we found rebrightening phenomena, which

of the gas flow near cold fronts is favorable for suppression of conduction by

state, or spatial location. These differences coupled with environmental
fluctuations in demographic rates can have subtle effects on population
persistence and species coexistence. To understand these effects, we provide a
general theory for coexistence of structured, interacting species living in a
stochastic environment. The theory is applicable to nonlinear, multi species
matrix models with stochastically varying parameters. The theory relies on
long-term growth rates of species corresponding to the dominant Lyapunov
exponents of random matrix products. Our coexistence criterion requires that a
convex combination of these long-term growth rates is positive with probability
one whenever one or more species are at low density. When this condition holds,
the community is stochastically persistent: the fraction of time that a species
density goes below $\delta>0$ approaches zero as $\delta$ approaches zero.
Applications to predator-prey interactions in an autocorrelated environment, a
stochastic LPA model, and spatial lottery models are provided. These
applications demonstrate that positive autocorrelations in temporal
fluctuations can disrupt predator-prey coexistence, fluctuations in
log-fecundity can facilitate persistence in structured populations, and
long-lived, relatively sedentary competing populations are likely to coexist in
spatially and temporally heterogenous environments.

mainly use parity-based RAID to provide reliability guarantees by striping
redundancy across multiple devices, but the effectiveness of RAID in SSDs

based on the projective differential geometry (i.e.\ geodesic path data) of the
given connection. The definition of projective compactness involves a real
parameter $\alpha$ called the order of projective compactness. For volume
preserving connections, this order is captured by a notion of volume
asymptotics that we define. These ideas apply to complete pseudo-Riemannian
spaces, via the Levi-Civita connection, and thus provide a notion of
compactification alternative to conformal compactification. For each order
$\alpha$, we provide an asymptotic form of a metric which is sufficient for
projective compactness of the given order, thus also providing many local
examples.
  Distinguished classes of projectively compactified geometries of orders one
and two are associated with Ricci-flat connections and non--Ricci--flat
Einstein metrics, respectively. Conversely, these geometric conditions are
shown to force the indicated order of projective compactness. These special
compactifications are shown to correspond to normal solutions of classes of
natural linear PDE (so-called first BGG equations), or equivalently holonomy
reductions of projective Cartan/tractor connections. This enables the
application of tools already available to reveal considerable information about
the geometry of the boundary at infinity. Finally, we show that metrics
admitting such special compactifications always have an asymptotic form as
mentioned above.

different substances involved in the reaction and their rates of formation. We
obtain the rates of product formation and ATP hydrolysis for both correct and
wrong substrates (isoleucine and valine in our case), in single molecular
enzyme as well as ensemble enzyme kinetics. The present theoretical scheme
correctly reproduces (i) the amplitude of the discrimination factor in the
overall rates between isoleucine and valine which is obtained as (1.8 \times
10^2).(4.33 \times 10^2) = 7.8 \times 10^4, (ii) the rates of ATP hydrolysis
for both Ile and Val at different substrate concentrations in the
aminoacylation of tRNA^{Ile}. The present study shows a non-michaelis type
dependence of rate of reaction on tRNA^{Ile} concentration in case of valine.
The editing in steady state is found to be independent of amino acid
concentration. Interestingly, the computed ATP hydrolysis rate for valine at
high substrate concentration is same as the rate of formation of Ile-tRNA^{Ile}
whereas at intermediate substrate concentration the ATP hydrolysis rate is
relatively low.

consider the interior point potential reduction algorithm of Kojima, Megiddo,
and Ye, which runs in time $O(\frac{-\delta}{\theta}n^4\log \epsilon^{-1})$,
where $\delta$ and $\theta$ are parameters that depend on $M$, and $\epsilon$
describes the quality of the solution. For 2TBSGs with $n$ states and discount
factor $\gamma$ we prove that in the worst case $\kappa =
\Theta(n/(1-\gamma)^2)$, $-\delta = \Theta(\sqrt{n}/(1-\gamma))$, and $1/\theta
= \Theta(n/(1-\gamma)^2)$. The lower bounds for $\kappa$, $-\delta$, and
$1/\theta$ are obtained using the same family of deterministic games.

We perform joint broadband spectral analysis of the brightest sources in the

demonstrate that the X-ray spectra of the ULXs cut off at energies more than
about 3keV with negligible contribution at high energies in the Suzaku HXD/PIN
band. The 90% upper limit on the 10-30keV band luminosity of an underlying
broadband power-law component is 3.5e38 ergs/s for M81 X-6 and 1.2e39ergs/s for
Holmberg IX X-1. These limits are more than an order of magnitude lower than
the bolometric (0.1-30 keV) luminosity of 6.8e39ergs/s for M81 X-6 and 1.9e40
ergs/s for Holmberg IX X-1. Our results confirm earlier indications of spectral
cut-offs inferred from the XMM-Newton observations of bright ULXs and show that
there isn't an additional high energy power-law component contributing
significantly to the X-ray emission. The spectral form of the two ULXs are very
different from those of Galactic black hole X-ray binaries (BHBs) or AGNs. This
implies that the ULXs are neither simply scaled-up versions of stellar mass
BHBs or scaled-down versions of AGNs.

superconductivity in Josephson junctions based on topological insulators (TIs).
For that purpose we propose to use superconducting Klein tunneling, i.e. the
reflectionless passage of Cooper pairs through a potential barrier in a gated
ballistic junction. This phenomenon occurs due to the fact that the
supercurrent is carried by helical Andreev bound states (ABSs) characterized by
spin-momentum locking similar to the normal-state carriers. We derive the
spectrum of the helical ABSs and the corresponding Josephson current for a
junction made on the surface of a three-dimensional TI. The superconducting
Klein tunneling is predicted to yield a non-sinusoidal current-phase relation
and an anomalous critical current $I_c$ that does not vanish with increasing
barrier strength. We also analyze the dependence of the I_cR_n product (where
R_n is the normal-state junction resistance) on the microscopic parameters of
the superconductor/TI interface, which leads to lower I_cR_n values than
expected from previous models of the proximity-effect Josephson junctions.

This was the starting point of the popular ""black hole (BH) information
paradox"". In a series of papers, together with collaborators, we naturally
interpreted BH quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in terms of quantum levels discussing
a model of excited BH somewhat similar to the historical semi-classical Bohr
model of the structure of a hydrogen atom. Here we explicitly write down, for
the same model, a time dependent Schr\""odinger equation for the system composed
by Hawking radiation and BH QNMs. The physical state and the correspondent wave
function are written in terms of an unitary evolution matrix instead of a
density matrix. Thus, the final state results to be a pure quantum state
instead of a mixed one. Hence, Hawking's claim is falsified because BHs result
to be well defined quantum mechanical systems, having ordered, discrete quantum
spectra, which respect 't Hooft's assumption that Schr\""oedinger equations can
be used universally for all dynamics in the universe. As a consequence,
information comes out in BH evaporation in terms of pure states in an unitary
time dependent evolution. In Section 4 of this paper we show that the present
approach permits also to solve the entanglement problem connected with the
information paradox.

C^{2}(\b{\Oarmega})$ is positive and $\nabla Q(\xi_{0})\neq0$ then, for
$\epsilon>0$ small enough, this problem has a positive solution $u_{\epsilon}$,
and that these solutions concentrate and blow up at $\xi_{0}$ as $\epsilon$
goes to 0.

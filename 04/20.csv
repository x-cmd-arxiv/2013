Every such module is either of a highest weight type or is a quotient of a
module of tensor fields on a torus, which was conjectured by Eswara Rao. This
generalizes the classical result of Mathieu on simple weight modules for the
Virasoro algebra. In our proof of the classification we construct a functor
from the category of cuspidal $W_n$-modules to the category of $W_n$-modules
with a compatible action of the algebra of functions on a torus. We also
present a new identity for certain quadratic elements in the universal

Inelastic scattering of electron vortex beams (EVB) was recently reported to
contain atom-specific magnetic information. We have developed a theoretical
description of inelastic scattering of EVB on crystals and performed
simulations for EVB of different diameters. We show that use of an EVB wider
than an interatomic distance does not provide any advantage over an ordinary
convergent beam without angular momentum. On the other hand, in the atomic
resolution limit, electron energy loss spectra measured by EVB are strongly
sensitive to the spin and orbital magnetic moments of studied matter, when
channeling through or very close to the atomic columns. Our results demonstrate
the boundaries for efficient use of EVB in measurement of magnetic properties.

of the transfer: on the one hand they suggest that it is a very slow process
and the charge is almost completely localized on one Watson-Crick pair, but on
the other hand they demonstrate that the charge can travel a very large
distance. To explain this contradiction we propose that superfast charge
transitions are possible between base pairs on individual DNA fragments
resulting in the establishment of a quasi-equilibrium charge distribution
during the time less than that of charge solvation. In other words, we
hypothesize these states irrespective of the nature of a mechanism responsible
for their establishment, whether it be a hopping mechanism, or a band
mechanism, or superexchange, or polaron transport, etc., leaving aside the
debates of which one is more advantageous. We discuss qualitative differences
between the charge transfer in a dry DNA and that in a solution. In a solution,
of great importance is the charge solvation which decreases the transfer rate
$10^7 - 10^8$ times as compared with a dry DNA. We consider the conditions
under which the superfast charge transfer in a DNA leading to quasi-equilibrium
distributions of polarons in a duplex is possible. Comparison of calculated
quasi-equilibrium distributions with the experiment testifies to the
possibility of superfast tunnel transitions of a hole in a DNA duplex in a
solution.

taking Reynolds-stress and buoyancy into account in the bulk of the stellar
convective envelope and convective core (when present). Redistribution of
angular momentum within the radiative layers accounts for damping of prograde

resonance. Over the whole mass range considered, IGW are found to be
efficiently generated by the convective envelope and to slow down the stellar
core early on the PMS. In stars more massive than ~ 1.6Msun, IGW produced by
the convective core also contribute to angular momentum redistribution close to
the ZAMS. Overall, IGW are found to significantly change the internal rotation

spectroscopy reveal two surface brightness discontinuities at 45 and 76 kpc
shown to be consistent with a pair of cold fronts. These features are
interpreted as due to sloshing of the central gas induced by an off-axis minor
merger with a perturber. This scenario is further supported by the presence of
a peculiar velocity of the central galaxy IC 1860 and the identification of a
possible perturber in the optically disturbed spiral galaxy IC 1859. The
identification of the perturber is consistent with the comparison with
numerical simulations of sloshing. The GMRT observation at 325 MHz shows faint,
extended radio emission contained within the inner cold front, as seen in some
galaxy clusters hosting diffuse radio mini-halos. However, unlike mini-halos,
no particle reacceleration is needed to explain the extended radio emission,
which is consistent with aged radio plasma redistributed by the sloshing. There
is strong analogy of the X-ray and optical phenomenology of the IC 1860 group
with two other groups, NGC 5044 and NGC 5846, showing cold fronts. The evidence
presented in this paper is among the strongest supporting the currently favored
model of cold-front formation in relaxed objects and establishes the group

the same in every truth assignment that satisfies the formula. The notion of
backbones for CNF formulas has been studied in various contexts. In this paper,
we introduce local variants of backbones, and study the computational
complexity of detecting them. In particular, we consider k-backbones, which are
backbones for sub-formulas consisting of at most k clauses, and iterative
k-backbones, which are backbones that result after repeated instantiations of
k-backbones. We determine the parameterized complexity of deciding whether a
variable is a k-backbone or an iterative k-backbone for various restricted
formula classes, including Horn, definite Horn, and Krom. We also present some
first empirical results regarding backbones for CNF-Satisfiability (SAT). The
empirical results we obtain show that a large fraction of the backbones of
structured SAT instances are local, in contrast to random instances, which
appear to have few local backbones.

molecular evolution-based methods to infer evidence for natural selection from
expression data are at a premium in the field, and to date, phylogenetic
approaches have not been well-suited to address the question in the small sets
of taxa profiled in standard surveys of gene expression. We have developed a
strategy to infer evolutionary histories from expression profiles by analyzing
suites of genes of common function. In a manner conceptually similar to
molecular evolution models in which the evolutionary rates of DNA sequence at
multiple loci follow a gamma distribution, we modeled expression of the genes
of an \emph{a priori}-defined pathway with rates drawn from an inverse gamma
distribution. We then developed a fitting strategy to infer the parameters of
this distribution from expression measurements, and to identify gene groups
whose expression patterns were consistent with evolutionary constraint or rapid
evolution in particular species. Simulations confirmed the power and accuracy
of our inference method. As an experimental testbed for our approach, we
generated and analyzed transcriptional profiles of four \emph{Saccharomyces}
yeasts. The results revealed pathways with signatures of constrained and
accelerated regulatory evolution in individual yeasts and across the phylogeny,
highlighting the prevalence of pathway-level expression change during the
divergence of yeast species. We anticipate that our pathway-based phylogenetic
approach will be of broad utility in the search to understand the evolutionary
relevance of regulatory change.

gravitationally-bound binaries and then to determine their orbits. Early
catalogues by the Herschels, Struves, and others began with their own
discoveries. In 1906 court reporter and amateur astronomer Sherburne Wesley
Burnham published a massive double star catalogue containing data from many
observers on more than 13,000 systems. Lick Observatory astronomer Robert Grant
Aitken produced a much larger catalogue in 1932 and coordinated with Robert
Innes of Johannesburg, who catalogued the southern systems. Aitken maintained
and expanded Burnham's records of observations on handwritten file cards, and
eventually turned them over to the Lick Observatory, where astrometrist
Hamilton Jeffers further expanded the collection and put all the observations
on punched cards. With the aid of Frances M. ""Rete"" Greeby he made two
catalogues: an Index Catalogue with basic data about each star, and a complete
catalogue of observations, with one observation per punched card. He enlisted
Willem van den Bos of Johannesburg to add southern stars, and together they
published the Index Catalogue of Visual Double Stars, 1961.0. As Jeffers
approached retirement he became greatly concerned about the disposition of the
catalogues. He wanted to be replaced by another ""double star man,"" but Lick
Director Albert E. Whitford had the new 120-inch reflector, the world's second
largest telescope, and he wanted to pursue modern astrophysics instead. Jeffers
was vociferously opposed to turning over the card files to another institution,
and especially against their coming under the control of Kaj Strand of the
United States Naval Observatory. The USNO got the files and has maintained the
records ever since, first under Charles Worley, and, since 1997, under Brian
Mason. Now called the Washington Double Star Catalog, it is online.

mass loss before the event, so that the optical luminosity is powered by the
circumstellar interaction. If the mass loss region has an optical depth
$>c/v_s$, where $v_s$ is the shock velocity, the shock breakout occurs in the
mass loss region and a significant fraction of the explosion energy can be
radiated. The emission from the superluminous SN 2006gy and the normal
luminosity SN 2011ht can plausibly be attributed to shock breakout in a wind,
with SN 2011ht being a low energy event. Superluminous supernovae of Type I may
derive their luminosity from interaction with a mass loss region of limited
extent. However, the distinctive temperature increase to maximum luminosity has
not been clearly observed in Type I events. Suggested mechanisms for the strong
mass loss include pulsational pair instability, gravity-waves generated by
instabilities in late burning phases, and binary effects.

graphene. Since the density of states diverges for these systems if the number
of layers exceeds three, screening effects are expected to be important. In the
random phase approximation, screening can be included through the polarization.
We derive an analytical integral expression for the polarization in both the
full-band model and an effective two-band model. Numerical evaluation of these
integrals are very time consuming in the full-band model. Hence, for
ABC-stacked trilayer graphene, we use the two-band model to calculate the low
momentum part of the polarization. The results for the two-band model are
universal, i.e. independent of doping. The high momentum part is linear and is
determined by calculating two points, such that we can determine the slope. For
ABC stacked trilayer graphene, the slope is given by three times the monolayer
value. We compare our results to previous ones in the literature and discuss
the similarities and discrepancies. Our results can be used to include
screening in ABC-stacked multilayer systems in a way that all the
characteristics of the polarization function are included. The numerical
results for the polarization of trilayer graphene are used to sketch the
screened potential.

as MBPs (magnetic bright points) or identified in spectro-polarimetric

and their dynamics play a crucial role in understanding the coronal heating
problem and also in surface dynamo models. MBPs can theoretically be described
to evolve out of a patch of a solar photospheric magnetic field with values
below the equipartition field strength by the so-called convective collapse
model. After the collapse, the magnetic field of MBPs reaches a higher stable
magnetic field level. The magnetic field strength distribution of small scale
magnetic fields as seen by MBPs is inferred. Furthermore, we want to test the
model of convective collapse and the theoretically predicted stable value of
about 1300 G. We used four different data sets of high-resolution Hinode/SOT
observations that were recorded simultaneously with the broadband filter device
(G-band, Ca II-H) and the spectro-polarimeter. To derive the magnetic field
strength distribution of these small scale features, the spectropolarimeter
(SP) data sets were treated by the Merlin inversion code. The four data sets
comprise different solar surface types: active regions (a sunspot group and a
region with pores), as well as quiet Sun. In all four cases the obtained
magnetic field strength distribution of MBPs is similar and shows peaks around
1300 G. This agrees well with the theoretical prediction of the convective
collapse model. The resulting magnetic field strength distribution can be
fitted in each case by a model consisting of log-normal components. The
important parameters, such as geometrical mean value and multiplicative
standard deviation, are similar in all data sets, only the relative weighting
of the components is different.

requires the magnetic field in a range of 250--350 gauss along with high

role of males as passive carriers of sex ratio genes. This shows inconsistency
between population genetic models of sex ratio evolution and classical
strategic models. In this work a novel technique of change of coordinates will
be applied to the new model. This will reveal new aspects of the modelled
phenomenon which cannot be shown or proven in the original formulation. The
underlying goal is to describe the dynamics of selection of particular genes in
the entire population, instead of in the same sex subpopulation, as in the
previous paper and earlier population genetics approaches. This allows for
analytical derivation of the unbiased strategic model from the model with
rigorous non-simplified genetics. In effect, an alternative system of
replicator equations is derived. It contains two subsystems: the first
describes changes in gene frequencies (this is an alternative unbiased
formalization of the Fisher-Dusing argument), whereas the second describes
changes in the sex ratios in subpopulations of carriers of genes for each
strategy. An intriguing analytical result of this work is that fitness of a
gene depends on the current sex ratio in the subpopulation of its carriers, not
on the encoded individual strategy. Thus, the argument of the gene fitness
function is not constant but is determined by the trajectory of the sex ratio
among carriers of that gene. This aspect of the modelled phenomenon cannot be
revealed by the static analysis. Dynamics of the sex ratio among gene carriers
is driven by a dynamic ""tug of war"" between female carriers expressing the
encoded strategic trait value and random partners of male carriers expressing
the average population strategy (a primary sex ratio). This mechanism can be
called ""double level selection"". Therefore, gene interest perspective leads to
multi-level selection.

degenerate superfluid ground state breaks both a discrete Z2 (Ising) symmetry

the experimental and theoretical analysis of the coherence properties of the

line with energy ~130 GeV in the Fermi-LAT data have attracted great interest
due to the possibility that the line feature stems from the annihilation of
dark matter particles. Many studies examining the robustness of the putative
line-signal have concentrated on its spectral attributes. Here, we study the
morphological features of the gamma-ray line photons, which can be used to
differentiate a putative dark matter signal from astrophysical backgrounds or
instrumental artifacts. Photons stemming from dark matter annihilation will
produce events tracing a specific morphology, with a statistical clustering
that can be calculated based on models of the dark matter density profile in
the inner Galaxy. We apply the DBSCAN clustering algorithm to Fermi gamma-ray
data, and show that we can rule out the possibility that 1 (2, 4) or fewer
point-like sources produce the observed morphology for the line photons at a
99% (95%, 90%) confidence level. Our study strongly disfavors the main
astrophysical background envisioned to produce a line feature at energies above
100 GeV: cold pulsar winds. It is highly unlikely that 4 or more such objects
have exactly the same monochromatic cosmic-ray energy needed to produce a
gamma-ray line, to within instrumental energy resolution. Furthermore, we show
that the larger photon statistics expected with Air Cherenkov Telescopes such
as H.E.S.S.-II will allow for extraordinarily stringent morphological tests of
the origin of the ""line photons"".

We compare our results with field measurements at similar redshifts using data
from a Ks-band selected catalogue of the COSMOS/UltraVISTA field. We construct
a Ks-band selected multi-colour catalogue for the clusters in 11 photometric
bands covering u-8um, and estimate photometric redshifts and stellar masses
using SED fitting techniques. To correct for interlopers in our cluster sample,
we use the deep spectroscopic component of GCLASS, which contains spectra for
1282 identified cluster and field galaxies taken with Gemini/GMOS. Both the
photometric and spectroscopic samples are sufficiently deep that we can probe
the SMF down to masses of 10^10 Msun. We distinguish between star-forming and
quiescent galaxies using the rest-frame U-V versus V-J diagram, and find that
the best-fitting Schechter parameters alpha and M* are similar within the
uncertainties for these galaxy types within the different environments.
However, there is a significant difference in the shape and normalisation of
the total SMF between the clusters and the field sample. This difference in the
total SMF is primarily a reflection of the increased fraction of quiescent
galaxies in high-density environments. We apply a simple quenching model that
includes components of mass- and environment-driven quenching, and find that in
this picture 45% of the star-forming galaxies, which normally would be forming
stars in the field, are quenched by the cluster. If galaxies in clusters and
the field quench their star formation via different mechanisms, these processes
have to conspire in such a way that the shapes of the quiescent and
star-forming SMF remain similar in these different environments.

Specifically, we consider a supergravity grand unification model with
non-universal gaugino masses where we take the $\mathrm{SU}(3)_C$ gaugino field
to be much heavier than the other gaugino and sfermion fields at the
unification scale. This construction naturally leads to a large mass splitting
between the slepton and squark masses, due to the mass splitting between the
electroweak gauginos and the gluino. The heavy Higgs bosons and Higgsinos also
follow the gluino toward large masses. We carry out a Bayesian Monte Carlo
analysis of the parametric space and find that it can simultaneously explain
the large Higgs mass, and the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, while
producing a negligible correction to the Standard Model prediction for
$\mathcal{B}r(B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-)$. We also find that the model leads to an

semantics of a program within a specified empirical error bound. Such
transformations have wide applications: they can decrease computation time,
power consumption, and memory usage, and can, in some cases, allow
implementations of incomputable operations. Correctness proofs of approximate
program transformations are by definition quantitative. Unfortunately, unlike
with standard program transformations, there is as of yet no modular way to
prove correctness of an approximate transformation itself. Error bounds must be
proved for each transformed program individually, and must be re-proved each
time a program is modified or a different set of approximations are applied. In
this paper, we give a semantics that enables quantitative reasoning about a
large class of approximate program transformations in a local, composable way.
Our semantics is based on a notion of distance between programs that defines
what it means for an approximate transformation to be correct up to an error
bound. The key insight is that distances between programs cannot in general be
formulated in terms of metric spaces and real numbers. Instead, our semantics
admits natural notions of distance for each type construct; for example,
numbers are used as distances for numerical data, functions are used as
distances for functional data, an polymorphic lambda-terms are used as
distances for polymorphic data. We then show how our semantics applies to two
example approximations: replacing reals with floating-point numbers, and loop
perforation.

different viewpoint and, specifically, we study the impact of the background
drift velocity on the energy loss rate of accelerated electrons in solar

the background instantaneously and coherently moves up to equilibrate the

which the star formation in the galaxy ceases. The halo property z_starve is
intended to encompass physical characteristics of halo mass assembly that may
deprive the galaxy of its cold gas supply and, ultimately, quench its star

galaxy color is in monotonic correspondence with z_starve, with the larger

both during the impulsive and temporally-extended emission phases, with
emission above 100 MeV lasting for approximately 20 hours. Accurate
localization of the gamma-ray production site(s) coincide with the solar active
region from which X-ray emissions associated with these flares originated. Our
analysis of the >100 MeV gamma-ray emission shows a relatively rapid monotonic
decrease in flux during the first hour of the impulsive phase, and a much
slower, almost monotonic decrease in flux for the next 20 hours. The spectra
can be adequately described by a power law with a high energy exponential
cutoff, or as resulting from the decay of neutral pions produced by accelerated
protons and ions with an isotropic power-law energy distribution. The required
proton spectrum has a number index ~3, with minor variations during the
impulsive phase, while during the temporally extended phase the spectrum
softens monotonically, starting with index ~4. The >30 MeV proton flux and
spectra observed near the Earth by the GOES satellites also show a monotonic
flux decrease and spectral softening during the extended phase, but with a
harder spectrum, with index ~3. Based on the Fermi-LAT and GOES observations of
the flux and spectral evolution of these bright flares, we explore the relative
merits of prompt and continuous acceleration scenarios, hadronic and leptonic
emission processes, and acceleration at the solar corona by the fast Coronal
Mass Ejections (CME) as explanations for the observations. We conclude that the
most likely scenario is continuous acceleration of protons in the solar corona
which penetrate the lower solar atmosphere and produce pions that decay into
gamma-rays.

understanding of these objects just as remote sensing in our own solar system
has increased our understanding of the solar system bodies. The challenge is to
quantitatively determine the range of temperatures and species abundances
allowed by the data. This challenge is often difficult given the low
information content of most exoplanet spectra which commonly leads to
degeneracies in the interpretation. A variety of temperature and abundance
retrieval approaches have been applied to exoplanet spectra, but no previous
investigations have sought to compare these approaches. In this investigation
we compare three different retrieval methods: Optimal Estimation, Differential
Evolution Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and Bootstrap Monte Carlo. We call our
suite of retrieval algorithms the Caltech Inverse Modeling and Retrieval
Algorithms (CHIMERA). We discuss what we can expect in terms of uncertainties
in abundances and temperatures given current observations as well as potential
future observations and what conclusions can be drawn given those
uncertainties. In general we find that the three approaches agree for high
quality spectra expected to come from potential future spaceborne missions, but
disagree for low quality spectra representative of current observations. We
also show that the Gaussian posterior probability distribution assumption made
in the Optimal Estimation approach is valid for high quality spectral data. We
also discuss the implications of our models for the inferred C to O ratios of
exoplanetary atmospheres, which of course are important for understanding
formation environments. More specifically we show that in the observational
limit of a few photometric points, the retrieved C/O is biased towards values
near solar and near one simply due to the assumption of uninformative priors.

is a possible indicator of the strength of the accretion disk wind, which is
expected to be SED dependent. Luminosity-dependent mean SEDs show that,
relative to the high-luminosity SED, low-luminosity SEDs exhibit a harder

lower-luminosity quasars and/or quasars with disk-dominated broad emission

to improve transmission rate in terms of the degree of freedom (DoF) gain. On
the other hand, orthogonal space-time block codes (STBCs) were widely used in
point-to-point multi-antenna channels to enhance transmission reliability in
terms of the diversity gain. In this paper, we connect these two ideas, i.e.,
IA and space-time block coding, to improve the designs of alignment precoders
for multi-user networks. Specifically, we consider the use of Alamouti codes
for IA because of its rate-one transmission and achievability of full diversity
in point-to-point systems. The Alamouti codes protect the desired link by
introducing orthogonality between the two symbols in one Alamouti codeword, and
create alignment at the interfering receiver. We show that the proposed
alignment methods can maintain the maximum DoF gain and improve the ergodic
mutual information in the long-term regime, while increasing the diversity gain
to 2 in the short-term regime. The presented examples of interference networks

where $p$ is a density function and $q$ is another density, or, more generally
an arbitrary function. Knowing or approximating this ratio is needed in various
problems of inference and integration, in particular, when one needs to average
a function with respect to one probability distribution, given a sample from
another. It is often referred as {\it importance sampling} in statistical
inference and is also closely related to the problem of {\it covariate shift}
in transfer learning as well as to various MCMC methods. It may also be useful
for separating the underlying geometry of a space, say a manifold, from the
density function defined on it.
  Our approach is based on reformulating the problem of estimating
$\frac{q}{p}$ as an inverse problem in terms of an integral operator
corresponding to a kernel, and thus reducing it to an integral equation, known
as the Fredholm problem of the first kind. This formulation, combined with the
techniques of regularization and kernel methods, leads to a principled
kernel-based framework for constructing algorithms and for analyzing them
theoretically.
  The resulting family of algorithms (FIRE, for Fredholm Inverse Regularized
Estimator) is flexible, simple and easy to implement.
  We provide detailed theoretical analysis including concentration bounds and
convergence rates for the Gaussian kernel in the case of densities defined on
$\R^d$, compact domains in $\R^d$ and smooth $d$-dimensional sub-manifolds of
the Euclidean space.
  We also show experimental results including applications to classification

demonstrate some encouraging experimental comparisons. We also show how the

essential role in the study of particle acceleration and energy conversion in
solar flares. In flares where gradual and impulsive emission components can be
readily identified the impulsive emission has been attributed to non-thermal
particles. We carry out detailed analysis of H\alpha\ and X-ray observations of
a GOES class B microflare loop on the solar disk. The impulsive hard X-ray
emission, however, is found to be consistent with a hot, quasi-thermal origin,
and there is little evidence of emission from chromospheric footpoints, which
challenges conventional models of flares and reveals a class of microflares
associated with dense loops. H\alpha\ observations indicate that the loop lies
very low in the solar corona or even in the chromosphere and both emission and
absorption materials evolve during the flare. The enhanced H\alpha\ emission
may very well originate from the photosphere when the low-lying flare loop
heats up the underlying chromosphere and reduces the corresponding H\alpha\
opacity. These observations may be compared with detailed modeling of flare
loops with the internal kink instability, where the mode remains confined in
space without apparent change in the global field shape, to uncover the
underlying physical processes and to probe the structure of solar atmosphere.

electrostatically measured by a conductance difference in a spin-precession
experiment under weak magnetic fields. Such an approach is feasible for almost
arbitrary Fermi energy. We also indicate that, it is a generally nonzero
self-interference delay that relates the IGD and dwell time in graphene.

problems which have simple local constraint sets and whose objective function
is the sum of local cost functions of distributed agents in a network.
Motivated by emerging applications in smart grid and distributed sparse
regression, this paper studies distributed optimization methods for solving
general problems which have a coupled global cost function and have inequality
constraints. We consider a network scenario where each agent has no global
knowledge and can access only its local mapping and constraint functions. To
solve this problem in a distributed manner, we propose a consensus-based
distributed primal-dual perturbation (PDP) algorithm. In the algorithm, agents
employ the average consensus technique to estimate the global cost and
constraint functions via exchanging messages with neighbors, and meanwhile use
a local primal-dual perturbed subgradient method to approach a global optimum.
The proposed PDP method not only can handle smooth inequality constraints but
also non-smooth constraints such as some sparsity promoting constraints arising
in sparse optimization. We prove that the proposed PDP algorithm converges to
an optimal primal-dual solution of the original problem, under standard problem
and network assumptions. Numerical results illustrating the performance of the
proposed algorithm for a distributed demand response control problem in smart
grid are also presented.

motion in the Wigner space representation to study non-Markovian and
non-perturbative thermal effects at finite temperature in a rigorous manner. We
study current variation in time and the current-voltage (I-V) relation of the

While all of the current oscillations decay in time in the NDR region in the

current oscillations in some parts of the plateau in the NDR region in the case
of weak coupling. We find that the effective potential in the oscillating case
possesses a basin-like form on the emitter side (emitter basin) and that the
current oscillation results from tunneling between the emitter basin and the
quantum well in the barriers. We find two distinct types of current
oscillations, with large and small oscillation amplitudes, respectively. These
two types of oscillation appear differently in the Wigner space, with one
exhibiting tornado-like motion and the other exhibiting a two piston

difficult . The control of electrical resistance at the nanometer scale
therefore requires new concepts, and the ultimate resistance-change device is
believed to exploit a purely electronic phase change such as the Mott insulator

metallic-like state. Our results suggest that this transition belongs to a new
class of resistive switching and might be explained by recent theoretical works
predicting that an insulator to metal transition can be achieved by a simple
electric field in a Mott Insulator. This new type of resistive switching has
potential to build up a new class of Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) with

  Science",,,,"physics.hist-ph astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  During the 1920s and 1930s, Italian physicists established strong
relationships with scientists from other European countries and the United
States. The career of Bruno Rossi, a leading personality in the study of cosmic
rays and an Italian pioneer of this field of research, provides a prominent
example of this kind of international cooperation. Physics underwent major
changes during these turbulent years, and the traditional internationalism of
physics assumed a more institutionalised character. Against this backdrop,
Rossi's early work was crucial in transforming the study of cosmic rays into a
branch of modern physics. His friendly relationships with eminent scientists
-notably Enrico Fermi, Walther Bothe, Werner Heisenberg, Hans Bethe, and Homi
Bhabha- were instrumental both for the exchange of knowledge about experimental
practises and theoretical discussions, and for attracting the attention of
physicists such as Arthur Compton, Louis Leprince-Ringuet, Pierre Auger and
Patrick Blackett to the problem of cosmic rays. Relying on material from
different archives in Europe and United States, this case study aims to provide
a glimpse of the intersection between national and international dimensions
during the 1930s, at a time when the study of cosmic rays was still very much
in its infancy, strongly interlaced with nuclear physics, and full of
uncertain, contradictory, and puzzling results. Nevertheless, as a source of
high-energy particles it became a proving ground for testing the validity of
the laws of quantum electrodynamics, and made a fundamental contribution to the
origins of particle physics.

isomorphic mappings into the strategy spaces of game theory. This approach is
motivated by discrepancies between probability theory and game theory when
applied to the same strategic situation. In particular, probability theory and
game theory can disagree on calculated values of the Fisher information, the
log likelihood function, entropy gradients, the rank and Jacobian of variable
transforms, and even the dimensionality and volume of the underlying
probability parameter spaces. These differences arise as probability theory
employs structure preserving isomorphic mappings when constructing strategy
spaces to analyze games. In contrast, game theory uses weaker mappings which
change some of the properties of the underlying probability distributions
within the mixed strategy space. Here, we explore how using strong isomorphic
mappings to define game strategy spaces can alter rational outcomes in simple
games . Specific example games considered are the chain store paradox, the
trust game, the ultimatum game, the public goods game, the centipede game, and
the iterated prisoner's dilemma. In general, our approach provides rational
outcomes which are consistent with observed human play and might thereby
resolve some of the paradoxes of game theory.

as a starting point of semiclassical analysis. The relation between the
spinfoam model and classical simplicial geometry is studied via the large spin
asymptotic expansion of the spinfoam amplitude with all spins uniformaly large.
More precisely in the large spin regime, there is an equivalence between the

us to classify the spinfoam critical configurations by their geometrical

between spinfoam critical configuration and simplical geometry also allows us
to define the notion of globally oriented and time-oriented spinfoam critical
configuration. It is shown that only at the globally oriented and time-oriented
spinfoam critical configuration, the leading order contribution of spinfoam
large spin asymptotics gives precisely an exponential of Lorentzian Regge
action of General Relativity. At all other (unphysical) critical
configurations, spinfoam large spin asymptotics modifies the Regge action at

spin regimes: 1<<\gamma^{-1}<<\lambda<<\gamma^{-2} and \lambda>\gamma^{-2}. The
model in two spin regimes has dramatically different number of effective
degrees of freedom. In 1<<\gamma^{-1}<<\lambda<<\gamma^{-2}, the model produces
in the leading order a functional integration of Regge action, which gives the
discrete Einstein equation for the leading contribution. There is no
restriction of Lorentzian deficit angle in this regime. In the other regime
\lambda>\gamma^{-2}, only small deficit angle is allowed
|\Theta_f|<<\gamma^{-1}\lambda^{1/2}$ mod 4\pi Z. When spins go even larger,
only zero deficit angle mod 4\pi Z is allowed asymptotically. In the transition

radiation formula and shows a remarkable constant temperature of T = 2.7. About
380 000 years after the Big Bang at a temperature of T = 3000 Kelvin in the
matter dominated era the electrons combine with the protons and 4He and the
photons move freely in the neutral universe. So the temperature and
distribution of the photons give us information of the universe 380 000 years
after the Big Bang. Information about earlier times can, in principle, be
derived from the Cosmic Neutrino Background (relic neutrinos). The neutrinos
decouple already about 1 second after the Big Bang at a temperature of around 1
MeV or 10^{10} Kelvin. Today their temperature is about 1.95 Kelvin.
Registration of these neutrinos is an extremely challenging experimental
problem, which can hardly be solved with the present technologies. On the other
hand it represents a tempting opportunity to check one of key elements of the
Big Bang Cosmology and to probe the early stages of the universe evolution. The
search for the Cosmic Neutrino Background with the induced beta decay: relic
neutrino + 3H --> 3He + e-, is the topic of this contribution. The signal would
show up as a peak in the electron spectrum by an energy with the neutrino mass
above the Q value. We discuss the prospects of this approach and argue that it
is able to set limits on the Cosmic Neutrino density in our vicinity. We also
discuss critically ways to increase with modifications of the present KATRIN
spectrometer the Tritium source intensity by a factor 100, which would yield
about 170 counts of relic neutrino captures per year. Presently such an
increase of the Tritium source intensity seems not to be possible. But one
should be able to find an upper limit for the local density of the relic
neutrinos in our galaxy.

problem in which each of $n$ nodes of a communication network has a unique
piece of information that must be transmitted to all the other nodes using
two-way communications (telephone calls) between the pairs of nodes. During a
call between the given two nodes, they exchange the whole information known to
them at that moment. In this paper we investigate the $k$-fault-tolerant gossip
problem, which is a generalization of the gossip problem, where at most $k$
arbitrary faults of calls are allowed. The problem is to find the minimal
number of calls $\tau(n,k)$ needed to guarantee the $k$-fault-tolerance. We
construct two classes of $k$-fault-tolerant gossip schemes (sequences of calls)
and found two upper bounds of $\tau(n,k)$, which improve the previously known
results. The first upper bound for general even $n$ is $\tau(n,k) \leq 1/2 n
\lceil\log_2 n\rceil + 1/2 n k$. This result is used to obtain the upper bound
for general odd $n$. From the expressions for the second upper bound it follows
that $\tau(n,k) \leq 2/3 n k + O(n)$ for large $n$. Assuming that the calls can
take place simultaneously, it is also of interest to find $k$-fault-tolerant
gossip schemes, which can spread the full information in minimal time. For even
$n$ we showed that the minimal time is $T(n,k)=\lceil\log_2 n\rceil + k$.

considering the diversity of different views have been proposed. These views
may be obtained from multiple sources or different feature subsets. In trying
to organize and highlight similarities and differences between the variety of
multi-view learning approaches, we review a number of representative multi-view
learning algorithms in different areas and classify them into three groups: 1)
co-training, 2) multiple kernel learning, and 3) subspace learning. Notably,
co-training style algorithms train alternately to maximize the mutual agreement
on two distinct views of the data; multiple kernel learning algorithms exploit
kernels that naturally correspond to different views and combine kernels either
linearly or non-linearly to improve learning performance; and subspace learning
algorithms aim to obtain a latent subspace shared by multiple views by assuming
that the input views are generated from this latent subspace. Though there is
significant variance in the approaches to integrating multiple views to improve
learning performance, they mainly exploit either the consensus principle or the
complementary principle to ensure the success of multi-view learning. Since
accessing multiple views is the fundament of multi-view learning, with the
exception of study on learning a model from multiple views, it is also valuable
to study how to construct multiple views and how to evaluate these views.
Overall, by exploring the consistency and complementary properties of different
views, multi-view learning is rendered more effective, more promising, and has
better generalization ability than single-view learning.

the ability to use light stimulation to regulate neural activity with
millisecond precision. In order to address the limitations in the efficacy of
the wild-type ChR2 (ChRwt) to achieve this objective, new variants of ChR2 that
exhibit fast mono-exponential photocurrent decay characteristics have been
recently developed and validated. In this paper, we investigate whether the
framework of transition rate model with 4 states, primarily developed to mimic
the bi-exponential photocurrent decay kinetics of ChRwt, as opposed to the low
complexity 3 state model, is warranted to mimic the mono-exponential
photocurrent decay kinetics of the newly developed fast ChR2 variants: ChETA
(Gunaydin et al., Nature Neurosci, 13:387-392, 2010) and ChRET/TC (Berndt et
al., PNAS, 108:7595-7600, 2011). We begin by estimating the parameters for the
3-state and 4-state models from experimental data on the photocurrent kinetics
of ChRwt, ChETA and ChRET/TC. We then incorporate these models into a
fast-spiking interneuron model (Wang and Buzsaki., J Neurosci,
16:6402-6413,1996) and a hippocampal pyramidal cell model (Golomb et al., J
Neurophysiol, 96:1912-1926, 2006) and investigate the extent to which the
experimentally observed neural response to various optostimulation protocols
can be captured by these models. We demonstrate that for all ChR2 variants
investigated, the 4 state model implementation is better able to capture neural
response consistent with experiments across wide range of optostimulation
protocol. We conclude by analytically investigating the conditions under which
the characteristic specific to the 3-state model, namely the mono-exponential
photocurrent decay of the newly developed variants of ChR2, can occurs in the
framework of the 4-state model.

we propose a family of generalized linear tensor regression models based upon

demonstrate, both numerically that the new model could provide a sound recovery

model constructed with an effective Lagrangian, in which the rho and omega
vector mesons are introduced as hidden gauge bosons, valid up to O(p^4) terms
in chiral expansion including the homogeneous Wess-Zumino terms. All the low
energy constants - apart from f_pi and m_rho - are fixed by the master formula
derived from the relation between 5-D hQCD and 4-D HLS. This allows one to pin
down the density n_1/2 at which the skyrmions in medium fractionize into
half-skyrmions, bringing in a drastic change in the EoS of dense matter. We
find that the U(1) field that figures in the CS term in the hQCD action or
equivalently the omega field in the hWZ term in the dimensionally reduced HLS
action plays a crucial role in the half-skyrmion phase. The importance of the
omega degree of freedom may be connected to what happens in the instanton
structure of elementary baryon noticed in hQCD. The most striking and
intriguing in what is found in the model is that f_pi that smoothly drops with
increasing density in the skyrmion phase stops decreasing at n_1/2 and remains
nearly constant in the half-skyrmion phase. In accordance with the large N_c
consideration, the baryon mass also stays non-scaling in the half-skyrmion
phase. This feature which is reminiscent of the parity-doublet baryon model
with a chirally invariant mass m_0 is supported by the nuclear EFT with the
parameters of the Lagrangian scaling modified at the skyrmion-half-skyrmion
phase transition. It also matches with one-loop RG analysis based on HLS. A
link between a non-vanishing m_0 and the origin of nucleon mass distinctive
from dynamically generated mass is suggested. We briefly discuss the possible
consequences of the topology change found in this paper on the forthcoming
